That\u2019s roughly all the time the major players have left to make their case for inclusion on the Kia MVP ballot. Since this is a regular season award (and something we are reminded of constantly), there is a clock that ticks on this campaign trail. There is no resting on what was done before the All-Star break \u2014 not with more than a quarter of the 2019-20 season left to be played. Now is as good a time as ever, then, to pause and recalibrate the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder for the stretch run of campaign season. There are some basic components that must be addressed by the contenders as factors they do (and do not) control will help define the race. The more boxes checked, the more likely a superstar will find his name on that ballot. That all said, these five key ingredients will come into play for everyone on the MVP list harboring dreams of snagging the Maurice Podoloff Trophy. 1. The narrative:  Hate it or love it, nothing resonates more than the right narrative as the regular season wanes, especially with a voting block (writers, broadcasters) who make their business crafting narratives. Every Kia MVP in recent memory benefited from a specific narrative to claim the trophy. Owning a compelling outline for the league\u2019s most distinguished individual honor is a must. 2. Window of opportunity:  As mentioned, the season\u2019s final eight weeks puts a premium on doing the work now . Easing into the regular season in the days and first few weeks after training camp is one thing. However, there is no such luxury in the MVP chase in the days and weeks after the All-Star break. 3. The importance of good health:  How many times have we seen an injury dash the hopes of an MVP candidate who simply could not stay healthy long enough to keep the pace into the final, critical weeks of the season? Availability, perhaps as much as anything, determines who makes the final ballot. 4. Sustained excellence:  It goes without saying that statistical superlatives matter in this race. Triple-doubles and leading the league in scoring have been the winning tools in recent seasons. Historic numbers, in any category, only enhances a candidate\u2019s reputation when determining how to separate the best of the very best. 5. Winning matters:  Team success, and the candidates\u2019 impact on the win column, is the most glaring and obvious gauge for the eventual Kia MVP. It\u2019s not everything, by any means, but it\u2019s a huge factor. * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last edition: No. 1 Season stats:  30.0 points, 13.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.1 steals, 1.1 block Antetokounmpo and the Bucks got back to business in their first game after the All-Star break as he notched 33 points, 16 rebounds, six assists and three steals in a rout of the Detroit Pistons. There will be no cruising to the finish line for \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d or the Bucks, who aim to hold on to the top spot in the standings and the home-court advantage throughout the 2020 playoffs. Last edition: No. 2 Season stats:  25.8 points, 7.8 rebounds, 10.8 assists, 1.3 steals LeBron has guided the Lakers into the spot many expected when they added Anthony Davis to the mix. Doing it by leading the league in assists while maintaining his spot among the league\u2019s MVP elite, during his 17th season no less, is remarkable on its own. But lifting the Lakers into the championship realm this spring and summer, if he can finish what he\u2019s started this season, is what will bolster his legacy. Last edition: No. 3 Season stats:  27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.8 steals Leonard is fresh off winning the first Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP award and the latest reminder that he occupies whatever spot he wants in the NBA\u2019s superstar pecking order. His workload the next few weeks will be greater given Paul George\u2019s availability is a bit of an unknown. Leonard has grown so accustomed to winning that it\u2019ll be hard for anything to shake his confidence in himself and a Clippers team built for June. Last edition: No. 6 Season stats: 28.9 points, 9.5 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.0 steals A couple of injury setbacks knocked Doncic off course a bit in this race. But, he should be locked in down the stretch for a Mavericks team that has seen Kristaps Porzingis recently develop into a more than capable No. 2 option. Getting them both to play at the highest level will be the difference between this being a surprisingly good season in Dallas or perhaps something much more than that for Doncic and the Mavericks. Last edition: Not ranked Season stats: 35.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.7 steals, 1.0 blocks Harden\u2019s embrace of the Rockets\u2019 small-ball system has unleashed the most unpredictable attack in the league \u2014 or at least for the remainder of this season. That he and Russell Westbrook \u2014 who recorded their first matching 20-point, 10-assist game on Thursday \u2014 are just getting into a good groove should worry the rest of the West. This is the team no one wants to see early in the playoffs. * * * * * * 6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets: He has shed 25 pounds since the start of training camp and powers the most underrated team in West. 7. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat: Miami\u2019s leader has to figure out how to apply the same focus at home on the road. 8. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers:  The other half \u2014 along with James \u2014 of the most dynamic duo in the league this season. 9. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics:  His emergence as the Celtics\u2019 go-to star during critical moments is a testament to his growth. 10. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers:  The groin injury suffered before the All-Star break is the only thing that slowed Lillard down. And five more:  Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz; Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder; Pascal Siakam, Toronto Raptors; Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

It\u2019s a League Pass free preview weekend! Basketball is back in session as of last night and things really pick up tonight with a nine-game slate. Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to miss any of the stretch run goodness (for the next three days, at least) as there\u2019s a League Pass free preview all weekend. We\u2019ll get into Friday\u2019s key matchups soon, but don\u2019t sleep on some of what\u2019s cooking Saturday ( Mavs vs. Hawks at 7:30 ET & Rockets vs. Jazz at 9 ET ) and Sunday ( Pacers-Raptors, 6 ET and Spurs-Thunder, 7 ET ). 2. Another big win on tap for Denver? The Nuggets, lest you had forgotten, were one of the NBA\u2019s hottest teams entering the All-Star break. They were 8-1 in their last nine games and rung up victories against the Jazz (twice), Bucks, Spurs and Blazers in that stretch. They\u2019ll have to keep proving themselves as they have one of the toughest stretch run schedules in the NBA, something that starts in earnest with a trip to Oklahoma City ( 8 ET, ESPN ). Keep an eye on the number of mid-range shots in this game as both teams rank in the top five in percentage of shot attempts from that distance. 3. Lakers start their stretch run Los Angeles is 41-12, has a five-game lead on Denver for No. 1 in the West and is 28-6 overall against West foes . Life is basically as good as its ever been in a long time for Lakers fans, but there\u2019s no time to rest as well. Mike Trudell of Lakers.com digs into the storylines to know for L.A. as it hosts Memphis to start the post-All-Star break portion of the schedule ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ). After the Lakers face the Grizzlies tonight, they\u2019ll only have four more home games against West teams currently in the playoff mix. 4. Opportunity knocks for Magic Yesterday\u2019s news that Kyrie Irving is done for the season is hardly what anyone (especially Nets fans) wanted to hear. However, the season waits for no one and Orlando may be poised to benefit from Brooklyn\u2019s latest dose of bad news. The Magic trail the Nets by 1 1\/2 games for No. 7 in the East (and the chance to avoid Milwaukee in the first round) as they host the Mavs tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ). The stage is set up well for Orlando to rise in the East as it has the second-easiest remaining schedule in the conference. 5. Jazz warming up again Given that we\u2019ve seen win streaks of 18 games (Milwaukee) and 15 games (Toronto) this season, a four-game streak pales in comparison. However, Utah has done just that and was on that small roll before the All-Star break (scoring wins over Portland, Dallas, Houston and Miami). The Jazz host the struggling Spurs ( 9 ET, League Pass ) in a somewhat easy stretch for Utah as six of its next 10 foes are under .500. The West is as intense as ever and the Jazz can\u2019t afford to get on a skid (they lost five in a row before this four-game win streak) if they want to rise the ranks in the playoff chase. 6. Lillard out as Blazers begin playoff push The 2019-20 season has not been without its difficulties for Portland, and that isn\u2019t about to let up now, either. All-Star guard Damian Lillard is out the next three to five games with a groin injury, which puts the Blazers at a decided disadvantage as playoff-hopefully New Orleans visits ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). This game is mostly about saving face for Portland as it has already lost the season series and any potential head-to-head playoff tiebreaker (should it come into play). It\u2019s not all doom and gloom for the Blazers, though: they have the second-easiest and most home-heavy schedule in the West down the stretch, which provides chances to gain some ground. 7. On this date: Carmelo heads to N.Y. In the 2010-11 season, the NBA world was abuzz about Carmelo Anthony\u2019s trade destination. On Feb. 21, 2011, that chatter ceased as the Nuggets traded Anthony (and Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Renaldo Balkman and Shelden Williams) to the New York Knicks in exchange for Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Timofey Mozgov, $3 million in cash, and a 2014 first-round Draft pick.

It was expected that Thompson would miss the entire season as he recovers from a torn knee ligament, and the Warriors said it definitively before their game against Houston on Thursday night. Coach Steve Kerr said it is too early to rule Thompson out to play for the U.S. team and he hasn\u2019t formed an opinion on what would be best for Thompson given July is still five months away. \u201cJust the determination by the training staff that even though he\u2019s coming along well there isn\u2019t really any chance that he\u2019s playing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThis is what I expected from the beginning given the severity of the injury and the normal timetable, and so here we are. It\u2019s no surprise. Thompson tore the ACL in his left knee last June 13 during the deciding Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the Toronto Raptors and had surgery July 2. He was re-evaluated over the All-Star break and the team said Stephen Curry\u2019s Splash Brother \u201cis making good progress and is right on track with his rehabilitation timeline.\u201d Golden State expects him ready to go for training camp in late September. It has been hard for Kerr to see Thompson lose something that he loves so much. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very frustrating year for Klay but I think he\u2019s almost out of the woods. He\u2019s a couple months away from this season ending and him moving toward a summer of preparing for the next season with his teammates, so I think that\u2019s a much better place for him to be emotionally,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI really felt bad for him. Klay loves to play basketball so much, he loves this game. It means so much to him. In some ways he\u2019s kind of been lost without it. He\u2019s been so anxious to be out there on the floor helping his teammates. The question now will be whether Thompson still wants to play in Tokyo if he is able despite not having returned to game action. An update on Curry\u2019s recovery and progress from a broken left hand is planned for Feb. 28 and he expects to be back on the court in March. Curry, Draymond Green and Thompson all have expressed their hopes of playing for the Americans this summer if healthy. Green\u2019s chances of making the team are uncertain. Kerr and Thompson have yet to discuss the Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s not off the table. It\u2019s still a possibility,\u201d Kerr said. \u201c\u2026 His health is the No. 1 concern so we\u2019ll kind of cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d"},{"id":28592,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-shoulder-injury-latest","date":"2020-02-21","title":"Nets guard Kyrie Irving out for season, will undergo shoulder surgery","content":"PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Kyrie Irving tried to keep playing through pain, a cortisone shot no longer providing enough relief. Eventually, he and the Brooklyn Nets decided it\u2019s best to get his right shoulder taken care of now and get healthy for next season \u2014 when Irving and Kevin Durant can finally play together. Irving will have arthroscopic surgery and miss the rest of the season, Nets general manager Sean Marks said Thursday. \u201cKyrie mentioned he was playing through pain and you have to give him a lot of credit for that. He wants to be out there and playing with his guys,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut there comes a point where you say enough is enough and again, it goes to long-term health. And the best thing that (we) could do is to shut it down and get this taken care of once and for all.\u201d Coach Kenny Atkinson said the point guard was still having trouble with the shoulder that began troubling him in October and sidelined him for 26 games earlier this season. \u201cSome days it was OK and other days it bothered him,\u201d Atkinson said before the Nets faced the Philadelphia 76ers. \u201cObviously, it is difficult to perform under those circumstances.\u201d Irving said pain in the shoulder initially worsened after a game on Nov. 4. The Nets then went on a five-game road trip, where Irving continued to play until the pain got so bad he was having trouble lifting his shoulder. He got a cortisone shot on Dec. 24 and was able to return on Jan. 12, but he acknowledged that surgery might still be necessary. Irving met with a specialist this week and by deciding to have a procedure now, his first season in Brooklyn ends after just 20 games. Irving averaged 27.4 points, with a 50-point game on opening night and a 54-point performance against Chicago on Jan. 31. He played only one more game after that. Marks said the Nets would have more information about Irving\u2019s recovery process after the surgery, but expects that he will be back for summer workouts. Irving, who signed a 4-year, $141 million contract with the Nets last summer, is averaging 27.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 6.4 assists. Atkinson said Irving was even better than he expected after watching him play in Cleveland and Boston. \u201cI really love the player and feel like we had a really good relationship. We are in a really good place, but obviously you want more. More reps, more time with him,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have time in the offseason to connect and work with him a little bit.\u201d Irving missed the last five games before the break with a sprained right knee. He now joins Durant on the sideline; the superstars signed with the Nets together in July. Durant has been out all season while recovering from surgery to repair his Achilles tendon. Assuming both are healthy to start the 2020-21 season, the Nets could become one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. \u201cWe\u2019re right on schedule and on target to put a contender out there,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the goal all along.\u201d Brooklyn is still in good position to make the playoffs, coming out of the break in seventh place in the East and five games ahead of ninth-place Washington. The Nets have received strong guard play from Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert.

Goodbye All-Star break, hello stretch run! It\u2019s been a minute (or more accurately, a week) since we\u2019ve had NBA games to watch. The All-Star break is behind us (hope you had a nice rest \u2014 we sure did around here) and the last 30 or so games of 2019-20 get rolling tonight . We\u2019ll get into the best matchups in a second, but before you go any further, give this amazing, team-by-team breakdown of things by our man John Schuhmann a look. If it doesn\u2019t get you thinking about the playoff picture and how 2019-20 could shake out, nothing will. 2. Can Sixers succeed with Horford in reserve? When Philadelphia added Al Horford in the offseason, the thinking was he and All-Star center Joel Embiid would be a nightmare for other starters to cover. It hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way and just before the All-Star break, the Sixers bumped Horford to a backup role. After a 29-20 mark with Horford as a starter in 2019-20, Philly is 1-0 with him as a reserve (a role he took on in their Feb. 11 win vs. the LA Clippers). The banged-up Brooklyn Nets are visiting next ( 8 ET, TNT ) and Horford sounds optimistic about the season and his role. We\u2019ll see how it all plays out, though, on the court. 3. Milwaukee\u2019s pursuit of 70 wins continues The Bucks \u2014 like perhaps no other team this season \u2014 have maintained the same focus since its opening night. They are well on pace for a 70-win season (which would be the NBA\u2019s first since 2015-16) as they take on a Pistons team ( 7 ET, League Pass ) that is very clearly looking ahead to 2020-21. Standing in the way of Milwaukee getting to 70 is a schedule that features a ton of games against teams currently No. 2-6 in the East. 4. Grizzlies\u2019 playoff push begins Few expected Memphis to be a serious playoff contender when 2019-20 began and even now, as the No. 8 seed in the West, they have a less than 25% chance of making the playoffs (per ESPN and FiveThirtyEight ). No team in the West has a harder road to the postseason the Memphis, whose remaining foes have a win percentage of 55.4%. The Grizzlies\u2019 playoff hopes could get a short-lived boost, perhaps, if they can drop the struggling Kings tonight ( 10 ET, League Pass ). Sacramento has been erratic all season: it is 15-19 vs. West teams over .500 \u2026 but two of its last four wins have come against playoff teams (the Miami Heat and LA Clippers). 5. Rockets in prime position to rise Inconsistency and roster change have been the name of the game for Houston this season, which is going all-in on small ball\/3-and-D players to finish the 2019-20 regular season. For all the talent Houston has, it is 20-9 against sub-.500 teams this season \u2014 the second-worst mark among West playoff teams. All that said, Houston has a chance to charge up the West standings thanks to it having one of the most favorable stretch-run schedules out there. The Rockets open things up by paying a visit to their old rivals, the Golden State Warriors ( 10:30 ET, TNT ), and eye a much easier road in March. 6. Happy 57th Birthday, Charles Barkley! Whether you know him as the outspoken NBA analyst on \u201cInside The NBA\u201d or the former NBA MVP and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer or the celebrity pitchman, Charles Barkley has left a lasting legacy on basketball and pop culture. He\u2019s turning 57 today and lest we get caught up in the Barkley of today, don\u2019t forget that upon his retirement, \u201cSir Charles\u201d was one of only four players in NBA history to have compiled at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists."},{"id":28558,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clint-capela-out-2-weeks-atlanta-hawks","date":"2020-02-19","title":"Hawks' Clint Capela out at least another 2 weeks","content":" The Hawks will have to wait a little longer before getting a look at their top trade deadline addition.

This was goodbye. But even on his way out, the admired coach gave his players one last lesson. He showed them honesty, dignity and vulnerability. He admitted the losing had beaten him. Beilein said he couldn\u2019t go on. \u201cIt took a real man to do that today,\u201d Cavs forward Kevin Love said. \u201cEverybody you talk to will say they respected the hell out of him.\u201d One of college basketball\u2019s most successful coaches over the past two decades, Beilein didn\u2019t make it through one NBA season. He resigned Wednesday after just 54 games with the rebuilding Cavaliers, who can\u2019t seem to find the right person to lead their team. The 67-year-old Beilein never got comfortable during his short stint in the pros. The demands of travel, lack of practice time and a group of players who didn\u2019t respond to his coaching style or respect him \u2014 until it was too late \u2014 proved to be too much, so he decided to move when the team returned from the All-Star break. \u201cThis was a very difficult decision for me, but I want to be clear \u2014 this was my decision to step down and I truly appreciate the understanding and support of the front office during this time,\u201d Beilein said in a statement released by the team. \u201cI find losing very challenging and this year has taken a much bigger toll on me than I expected. I grew concerned for the consequences this toll could potentially take on my own health and my family\u2019s well-being down the road. \u201cI was not certain I could be at my best for the remainder of the season and in the future.\u201d Before the Cavs officially announced his resignation, Beilein spoke to his players. Love described the coach\u2019s actions as \u201cballsy\u201d and the mood as \u201cpowerful.\u201d \u201cFor him to do come in and do that and look us all in the eye, and acknowledge that integrity and willingness, that\u2019s big,\u201d Love said. \u201cThat\u2019s real man (stuff) right there. So I respect him for coming in and doing that because he didn\u2019t have to.\u201d The Cavs went just 14-40 under Beilein, who surprisingly left Michigan after 12 seasons and signed a five-year contract last May. The team said he will be reassigned to a different role within the organization. Associate head coach J.B. Bickerstaff is taking over Beilein and will attempt to put the pieces back together for the next 28 games \u2014 and beyond. The team is still working through some contract language for Bickerstaff, who took over teams in Memphis and Houston but is thankful not to have the \u201cinterim\u201d tag on his title this time. \u201cThis gives you an opportunity to make very difficult decisions without that same amount of weight that you have to face, where as an interim you\u2019re fighting for your life,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives you a little bit of relief from that, and you can make harder decisions based on the long-term and not just the short-term.\u201d Almost from the start of training camp there were issues for Beilein in Cleveland. The Cavs didn\u2019t embrace Beilein\u2019s practice methods \u2014 he had his big men doing grade-school level fundamental \u201cMikan\u201d drills \u2014 and players grumbled that he was treating them like kids and not paid professionals. But what really hurt Beilein was the losing after so much success in college, \u201cHe came in every day, he busted his ass, wanted to be better, wanted to change the culture,\u201d Love said. \u201cBut sometimes, what do they say, \u2018If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.\u2019 Sometimes it doesn\u2019t always shake out or work the way you want it to.\u201d Cavs general manager Koby Altman stood by Beilein throughout his tenure. But as the All-Star break approached, it became evident that a change was necessary in order to salvage a season that from the start was devoted to developing the Cavs\u2019 core of young talent. Beilein is not the first high-profile college coach to flop in the NBA. Kentucky\u2019s John Calipari, Rick Pitino, Tim Floyd, Mike Montgomery and P.J. Carlesimo are among a group who found coaching at the highest level problematic. \u201cWhile it\u2019s unexpected, we understand and respect his decision to step down as head coach of the Cavaliers,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI was excited about the development of our young players, who have all shown growth and maturity under coach Beilein. \u2026 The NBA is a unique business that sometimes requires aggressive risk-taking on important long-term decisions to move a franchise forward and ultimately compete for championships.\u201d While the Cavs didn\u2019t make things easy on Beilein, he didn\u2019t help himself, either. During a team meeting in Detroit, he inadvertently called his players \u201cthugs\u201d when reviewing game film. Beilein apologized, but the incident caused a larger wedge between him and the players. \u201cThere was no coming back from that,\u201d one Cavaliers player reportedly told The Athletic . It was hardly all Beilein\u2019s fault. Some blame has to fall on the Cavs, who have had four coaches in the past two years. \u201cIn some ways, in a lot of ways,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe could have been a lot better.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":28566,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-all-star-jaren-jackson-devonte-graham-tim-hardaway-sr","date":"2020-02-19","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Jaren Jackson Jr., Devonte Graham + Tim Hardaway Sr.","content":"Sekou Smith was busy at All-Star Weekend in Chicago.

With a rotation that includes five guys in their first, second or third seasons, the Grizz were not supposed to compete for a playoff spot. And through the first seven weeks of the season, the Grizzlies were 6-16 and in 13th place in the West . But they\u2019ve seen marked improvement since then. And as we come out of the All-Star break, the Grizzlies are in eighth place in the West at 28-26, five games in the loss column ahead of the ninth-place Portland Trail Blazers and 10th-place San Antonio Spurs, veteran teams with active playoff streaks of six and 22 seasons , respectively. Some early playoff experience for Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson would be huge. But the Grizzlies aren\u2019t in the postseason yet. And though they have a big cushion for that final playoff spot in the West, they have the league\u2019s toughest schedule going forward, both in regard to opponent strength (cumulative opponent winning percentage of .554) and amount of road games (16 of their final 28 games are on the road). The Grizzlies will have 16 games against the other 13 teams that have winning records . That includes two games each against the Lakers, Raptors, Rockets, Mavs and Thunder. Of the Grizzlies\u2019 12 games that aren\u2019t against teams with winning records, five are against the three teams \u2013 Portland (2), San Antonio (1) and New Orleans (2) \u2013 chasing them for that final Western Conference playoff spot. To make things more interesting, the Pelicans have the easiest remaining schedule in the league, with only nine of their final 27 games against teams currently over .500. The Blazers, meanwhile, have the second easiest and the most home-heavy remaining schedule in the West. Both ESPN and FiveThirtyEight show the Grizzlies as having a less-than-25% chance of making the playoffs, which is pretty wild for a team that has a five-game lead in the loss column with less than 30 games to go. But it speaks to both the Grizzlies\u2019 relatively weak point differential (-1.4 per game) and how difficult their remaining schedule is. If they keep that playoff spot, they certainly will have earned it. * * * Important note: The following schedule analysis is done with the league having yet to reschedule the Clippers-Lakers game that was postponed after the death of Kobe Bryant. We assume the game will be rescheduled for Friday, April 10, an available date for both teams that wouldn\u2019t create a back-to-back-to-back situation for either. But that\u2019s just an assumption, with the league likely to announce the make-up date soon. With that assumption, here\u2019s a breakdown of every Western Conference team\u2019s remaining schedule \u2026 Rest advantage \/ Rest disadvantage: Games in which one team (at a disadvantage) played the day before and the other (at an advantage) did not. This season, teams are 103-89 (.536) with a rest advantage, 70-55 (.560) at home and 33-34 (.493) on the road. More Western Conference notes: * * *  If there\u2019s an Eastern Conference team that can keep the 46-8 Milwaukee Bucks from reaching The Finals, we\u2019ll get some clues in the final eight weeks of the season, because the Bucks have more games against teams 2-6 in the East after the break (10) than they had before it (nine). That includes three more games against the second-place Toronto Raptors, two more against the third-place Boston Celtics, two more against the fourth-place Miami Heat, and two more against the fifth-place Philadelphia 76ers. The Bucks are currently 3-3 against that group , having lost to Boston (1-1), Miami (0-1) and Philly (1-1). The Bucks will be at a rest disadvantage for two of those 10 remaining games against the group: Feb. 25 in Toronto and March 2 in Miami, with games in Washington and Charlotte the nights before those marquee matchups. They won\u2019t have a rest advantage for any of the 10. The most fun stretch of Milwaukee\u2019s remaining schedule should be the first seven days of April . They\u2019ll host the champs on April 1, and then head out on a three-game trip through Toronto, Boston and Philadelphia. In total, the Bucks are tied with the Grizzlies for the most games remaining (16) vs. teams with winning records. That includes road games against the Lakers (March 6) and the two Western Conference teams with wins in Milwaukee : Denver (March 9) and Dallas (March 29). Most of the games noted above will be against good offenses. The Bucks rank No. 1 defensively overall , having allowed 3.4 fewer points per 100 possessions than any other team (a remarkable differential) and 8.0 fewer than the league average, the third best differential in the 24 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. But they rank just eighth defensively (109.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) in games against the top 13* offenses , and have played the fewest games (17) against that group. * Typically, we\u2019ll measure defenses vs. the top 10 offenses, but going into the break, there wasn\u2019t much of a gap between the Heat\u2019s ninth-ranked offense (111.7 points scored per 100 possessions) and the Wizards at 13 (111.3) . Over the last eight weeks, the Bucks will play 14 of their 28 games against offenses that currently rank 13th or better. When they lose, they usually give up a lot of 3-pointers, so games against the Mavs ( first in 3-pointers per game ), Rockets (second) and Raptors (fifth) will be particularly interesting in that regard. * * * More Eastern Conference notes: * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

( Western Conference answers ) * * * Steve Aschburner : Milwaukee has what appears to be an insurmountable lead for the No. 1 seed and has been crushing this 2019-20 regular season. If the Bucks lose as many games (8) from this point forward as they\u2019ve lost so far, they\u2019ll finish at 66-16. If they play .500 the rest of the way, they\u2019ll still match last season\u2019s 60-22. Their historic scoring margin (+12.8 points) has convinced a lot of the numbers crunchers, too. And their repeat MVP-worthy star Giannis Antetokounmpo is averaging only 30.9 minutes. Still, I wonder about two things with Milwaukee: the lack of experience at the highest level and the absence of any intimidation factor. Only two players on its roster have advanced beyond a conference championship series (reserves George Hill and Kyle Korver). And from chatter around the league, in spite of the Bucks\u2019 strong regular season, none of their top rivals sound afraid or defeated. In the East, that means Boston , Philadelphia , Toronto and Miami , each of which believes it could topple Milwaukee to reach the Finals (or clear the way for one of the others). So the Bucks may need to get nastier \u2013 not physically, but in a more sneering, dominant attitude \u2013 if they want to be playing in June. Shaun Powell :  This whittles down to the Bucks, Raptors and Celtics. Those are the three teams that have shown the least amount of issues and flapping red flags. Much props for the Raptors to even be in this discussion after losing Kawhi Leonard and watching Marc Gasol take another step toward the age abyss. The East-leading Bucks are not only winning most games convincingly, they\u2019re almost unbeatable on the road. Meanwhile, Boston brings the most well-rounded rotation to the fray. John Schuhmann :  A case can be made for each of the top five teams in the conference, but the Bucks should be the clear favorite . They have been, simply, the best team in the league by a wide margin. They rank in the top three on both ends of the floor and they have the best record (12-7) in games played between the 14 teams with winning records. The Raptors are probably the team best equipped to beat the Bucks. They have an elite defense that\u2019s practiced at protecting the paint and rotating out to shooters, and they have an offense that can take advantage of the Bucks\u2019 protect-the-rim-at-call-costs defensive scheme by moving the ball. Sekou Smith :  I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m typing this, but I honestly think the East goes five deep in terms of true contenders . I could see any of the top five teams (Milwaukee, Toronto, Boston, Miami and Philadelphia) coming out of the East under the right set of circumstances. And each one of them would present a particular set of problems for their Western Conference counterpart, whoever that team might be. The Bucks are clearly the front-runners at this stage, but as we saw last season, matchups are everything. The Bucks don\u2019t seem like The Finals lock the Golden State Warriors did the past five seasons, but \u2026 too soon, huh? Michael C. Wright :  Milwaukee.  The Bucks have a legitimate shot to win 70 games, and they\u2019ve got the No. 1 defense and the No. 2 offense in the NBA. They\u2019re the favorite in the East by a large margin. But you can\u2019t count out the Celtics or the defending champion Toronto Raptors , who ran off a 15-game winning streak before falling to the Nets just before the All-Star break. Philadelphia can\u2019t win on the road, so they probably don\u2019t belong in this conversation as much as Miami does."},{"id":28597,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-true-contenders-in-west","date":"2020-02-19","title":"Blogtable: Who are the true contenders to win it all in the West?","content":" * * * Who are the true contenders to win it all in the West?   ( Eastern Conference answers ) * * * Steve Aschburner : Can I just say \u201cLos Angeles\u201d and cover my bets? The Lakers beat the other teams, the Clippers beat the Lakers. That\u2019s how this season has gone out West. I can\u2019t ignore the intensity with which the Lakers have played this regular season, a noticeable change for LeBron James\u2019 recent teams. Since the 2012-13 Heat went 66-16, his clubs have been more about peaking for the playoffs. This season has been more about instilling a killer instinct, it appears, and that mostly has gone well \u2013 with the exception of that pesky 0-6 mark against Boston, the Clippers, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Toronto. The Clippers have beaten them twice and believe their roster is deeper and more talented than the Lakers. Their challenge is to solidify a pecking order with all those potential contributors and, of course, nail down their approach when load management comes off the table. Can\u2019t see Denver or Utah upsetting either of the L.A. teams, and I won\u2019t believe in Houston until we can see the reflection of a certain bushy beard in the shiny Larry O\u2019Brien trophy. Shaun Powell :  Let\u2019s confine this competition to the 213. Just as we suspected back in October, it\u2019s Lakers and Clippers looming beastly in the West. LeBron James and Anthony Davis should be enough to capture the West\u2019s best record, while the Clippers bring more upside because they haven\u2019t been whole for even half a season and just added Marcus Morris. Utah and Denver have righted their ships, but are they really causing sleepless nights in L.A.? John Schuhmann :  It\u2019s hard to look past the two L.A. teams . The Lakers rank in the top five on both ends of the floor and are 12-3 against the other six teams in playoff position in the West. The Clippers have had their ups and downs, but they\u2019ve had the league\u2019s best defense in games against top-13 offenses, they have two wins over the Lakers, and Kawhi Leonard is the best go-to guy playing this season. The Nuggets and Jazz shouldn\u2019t be dismissed, though. Denver is 10-5 in games between the top eight teams in the West, and Utah has the league\u2019s best offense since Christmas. If the Jazz can start defending at the level they have in years past, they have what it takes to be a serious threat. No team is more intriguing than the Rockets right now, but they haven\u2019t shown that they can defend at the level they will need to against these other teams in the playoffs. Sekou Smith :  No disrespect to the mighty Western Conference, but if anyone other than the Lakers or Clippers is still playing in June I\u2019ll be shocked. That\u2019s not a knock on the quality of the rest of the competition in the West. Denver, Utah and Houston all have the potential to make things interesting under ideal conditions. But the Los Angeles teams are clearly the bullies on the block. Michael C. Wright :  Easily the Lakers and the Clippers , and although teams like the Nuggets and the Jazz are quietly making noise, the only other true contender in the West from this vantage point is the Houston Rockets. It remains to be seen whether Houston\u2019s embrace of small ball is sustainable, especially in a long playoff series facing bigs such as Nikola Jokic and Rudy Gobert. But added shooting and defense with the additions of Robert Covington and DeMarre Carroll help. The championship window is closing in Houston, and everybody knows it. So the expectation is the Rockets finish out this season playing with a sense of urgency."},{"id":28582,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-dark-horse-contenders","date":"2020-02-19","title":"Blogtable: Which dark horse team should we keep an eye on?","content":" * * * Who is a dark horse team to keep an eye on down the stretch?   * * * Steve Aschburner : Toronto . And before someone pipes up about it\u2019s impossible by definition for the defending NBA champions to be a \u201cdark horse,\u201d let\u2019s remember that Miami dropped to 37-45 the season after LeBron James left and clearly would have qualified as a dark horse. Kawhi Leonard\u2019s decision to leave Toronto with the confetti and champagne still in his hair seemed certain to make that team a one-and-done champion. But the Raptors learned how to win without him last season, going 17-5 when Leonard sat out, and have been applying those lessons this season. Who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t continue in the postseason? They don\u2019t fear the Bucks after last spring\u2019s East finals (spotted Milwaukee a 2-0 lead, then swept the next four), and they\u2019ve tightened up defensively more than they\u2019ve slipped offensively in Leonard\u2019s absence. Guess 25 years means it\u2019s time to repeat an NBA lesson, a la Rudy Tomjanovich: Never underestimate the heart of a champion. Shaun Powell :  Methinks the architect Pat Riley is feeling smug about the Heat right now. He has built Miami into a growing threat and while Jimmy Butler and company are probably another year and trade away, they can swoop in if circumstances fall in their favor come postseason. They may be more than a tough out. John Schuhmann :  Philadelphia . If you go back to preseason predictions, the Sixers wouldn\u2019t be considered a dark horse; they were a popular pick to reach The Finals. But as we come out of the All-Star break, they\u2019re in fifth place, with a 9-19 road record and the league\u2019s 20th-ranked offense. It\u2019s not time to count them out, though. The Sixers have played the toughest schedule among the top six teams in the East and their 25-2 record at home is best in the entire NBA. The Sixers have one of the league\u2019s biggest home-road differentials in regard to point differential per 100 possessions last season, but they won three of their first four road playoff games and were the closest to knocking off the eventual champs. Sekou Smith :  Miami\u2019s the pick in the East. If the tweaks at the trade deadline provide the boost they could, this Heat crew could play spoiler in the entire playoffs, not just the East. The toughness and roster stick out. Having a coach with the championship seasoning Erik Spoelstra brings to the operation certainly aids the cause. But the defensive potential of All-Stars Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and newcomers Andre Iguodala and Jae Crowder gives the Heat versatility to deal with anything other East contenders might throw at them.  Michael C. Wright :  Miami isn\u2019t necessarily a dark horse, but nobody before the season expected the Heat to be playing at this level. Miami is 11-5 against teams in the top eight of their respective conferences, they\u2019ve beaten the Bucks, and are a combined 5-1 against the Pacers and the 76ers. Of the top eight in the East, only the Celtics own a winning record over the Heat, and the additions of Andre Iguodala, Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill just might take this team over the top."},{"id":28572,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-john-beilein-considering-resignation","date":"2020-02-19","title":"Reports: Cavaliers, coach John Beilein to part ways on Wednesday","content":" UPDATE (Feb. 19):  Beilein officially steps down from position with Cavs Cavaliers coach John Beilein left a prime college coaching situation at Michigan to take over in Cleveland, but the adjustment to managing professionals has proven rocky.

The former Miami and Toronto forward released a video statement on social media Tuesday, using some version of the word disappoint \u2014 be it disappointed, disappointment or disappointing \u2014 no fewer than 15 times in 5 minutes. Bosh was a surprising omission last week from the class of eight finalists announced by the Hall as still being under consideration for enshrinement this year, a list that included contemporary players Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. The class of inductees will be revealed in Atlanta on April 4 at the men\u2019s college basketball Final Four, and the Basketball Hall of Fame ceremony is in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Aug. 29. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cI\u2019m a competitive man. I\u2019ve been competing my whole life. A lot of people don\u2019t really know that about me, but I\u2019m a fierce competitor. Losing bothers me. Coming up short bothers me. It always has, you know, since the moment I started playing basketball and it kind of bleeds over into everything that I do. So I\u2019ll just get ahead of it. And so you hear this from me, I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d Bosh is one of 13 players in NBA history to average 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds in a career that included at least 11 All-Star selections. The other 12 \u2014 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Karl Malone, Shaquille ONeal, Charles Barkley, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Larry Bird, Bob Pettit, Patrick Ewing, Elvin Hayes and Elgin Baylor \u2014 are all in the Hall of Fame. Bosh is also the only Hall-eligible player with 17,189 points, 7,592 rebounds, 1,795 assists, 11 All-Star selections and two championships who is not already in, or a finalist this year for, the Hall of Fame. There are other players with those numbers, such as LeBron James and Dirk Nowitzki, who are not yet eligible because they\u2019re still playing or retired too recently. \u201cOne of the things people like to say is, Oh, next year,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s not a next year? That\u2019s something that I think about every day. And I hope you think about it as well, but what if there\u2019s not a tomorrow? What does that even mean? That is a definite question that\u2019s been on my mind quite a bit, but I just have to be honest with you guys. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d Bosh, who turns 36 next month, said he wishes he was still playing and believes he would still be in the NBA if not for the health issues that abruptly ended his career in 2016. Bosh had at least two bouts with blood clots. He was an All-Star for Miami in his final season, 2015-16. He was averaging 19.1 points and 7.4 rebounds that season and had just arrived in Toronto for that years All-Star Game when a clot in one of his legs was discovered. He never played again. Bosh eventually came to grips with that reality, saw his jersey be retired by the Heat \u2013 the team with whom he won two championships, a stint perhaps most notably remembered by his rebound and assist that set up Ray Allen\u2019s season-saving, game-tying 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals against San Antonio. Bosh also blocked a 3-point try by Danny Green at the end of overtime to seal Miamis three-point win, and the Heat would go on to win Game 7 for their second straight title. \u201cI\u2019ve been disappointed with my career coming up short,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cI feel that I should still be playing basketball right now, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. That was in my goals. That was in my plans and it just did not work out like that. I don\u2019t want to be in this position. Now I\u2019m here dealing with that. Had other plans, started making plans on the potentiality of going in with such a great class, didn\u2019t even qualify.

It would be a surprise if they aren\u2019t the No. 1 seeds when the playoffs begin on April 18, but both still have some business to take care of. The Bucks will have a much tougher schedule after the break than they did before it, and the Lakers are 2-6 against the other four teams with top-five records (both of the wins have come by single digits in Denver). There\u2019s a lot more to be determined further down the standings. While there seems to be a clear top eight in each conference, there\u2019s a lot of basketball (33% of the season, to be exact) still to be played.

Teams are now going back on grind for the playoff push that naturally accompanies the rest of the season. Here, we look at 10 storylines worth watching after the All-Star break: * * * Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant certainly appears to be on the way, as he\u2019s averaging 17.6 points and 7.1 assists. At All-Star weekend, several of Morant\u2019s NBA peers endorsed him for the award, including fellow Rookie of the Year candidate Kendrick Nunn of the Miami Heat and Jaren Jackson Jr., Morant\u2019s teammate. New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson (22.1 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 57.6% shooting) will certainly be considered among the favorites, but injuries kept him out of the season\u2019s first 44 games \u2014 all while Morant kept showing up and showing out every night. Courtesy of the addition of 3-and-D specialist Robert Covington, the Rockets are now giving more spacing to two of the NBA\u2019s most dangerous guards in James Harden and Russell Westbrook. That\u2019s difficult to guard \u2026 even for the most athletic of NBA teams. Houston low-key became a more versatile squad with this new lineup, and you can\u2019t forget the Rockets can still play a more traditional lineup when needed with centers Isaiah Hartenstein and Tyson Chandler in the fold. Milwaukee needs to win 24 of its last 28 games to become the third team in NBA history to capture 70 victories in a season \u2014 a feat accomplished by the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (who went 72-10) and the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors (73-9). It won\u2019t be easy with the red-hot Toronto Raptors \u2014 winners of 15 of their last 16 entering the All-Star break \u2014 trying to catch them. Both teams face off three more times. Milwaukee plays 17 of its last 28 games against teams currently sitting in the top eight of their respective conference standings.  In the East, just five games separate the seventh-, eighth-and ninth-place teams. The ninth-place Wizards are just three games behind No. 8 Orlando, and the Magic trail seventh-place Brooklyn by just two games. Even the Chicago Bulls, currently at 10th in the East, are five games behind Orlando. In the West , eighth-place Memphis comes out of the All-Star break with a four-game lead on Portland. However, San Antonio and New Orleans are lurking behind the Blazers for that eighth spot. Memphis is hot, having won eight of its last 10, and it might be poised to put some distance between itself and the other teams vying for the final playoff berth. San Antonio has advanced to the postseason for a record-tying 22 consecutive seasons, but its 23-31 mark at the All-Star break ranks as the worst at that juncture since the 1996-97 season. That was the season before San Antonio drafted franchise icon Tim Duncan No. 1 overall. The Spurs started their annual rodeo road trip by dropping five of six games, and they\u2019ve lost seven of their last 10. San Antonio\u2019s next three matchups come against teams likely to make the playoffs (Utah, Oklahoma City and Dallas). It\u2019s certainly looking that way for the defending champions, which ran off a 15-game winning streak before falling to the Nets going into All-Star weekend. Last season at this point, the Raptors sat at second in the East behind Milwaukee going into the All-Star break, and we all saw how that ended. It\u2019s not quite the same situation as 2018-19, though, as Toronto is currently 6 1\/2 games behind the Bucks. At the break in 2018-19 the separation was only one game. The Raptors are No. 12 in Offensive Rating , No. 2 in Defensive Rating , No. 3 in 3-point percentage (37.7%) and No. 5 in 3-pointers made per game (13.7). That\u2019s legit. The Clippers defeated the Lakers twice in the first half of the season , and meeting No. 3 was postponed after the tragic death of Kobe Bryant. The Clippers are currently third in the West, five games behind the Lakers. If the Clippers find a way to secure that No. 2 seed, they\u2019ll essentially be playing at home throughout the entire postseason, which could make for a fun matchup in the West finals against the Lakers, provided they meet there and the Lakers remain No. 1 in the West. Two regular-season contests \u2013 March 8 (3:30 ET, ABC) and the make-up date (yet to be scheduled) \u2014 remain in this new rivalry. Curry played in just four games before suffering a broken left hand, and he\u2019s targeted early March for a return. With the Warriors owning the worst record in the league (12-43), Curry won\u2019t be able to help much, and that naturally leads to concern about whether bringing him back this season is the smart play. Curry said he wants to end his season on a strong note, but the Warriors should tread carefully in exposing their best player to injury since the playoffs are out of reach. Philadelphia is 25-2 at home, but needs to start winning on the road, where it has struggled to a 9-19 record. Major tests await starting Saturday at Milwaukee ( 8:30 ET, ABC ), before a West Coast trip for games on March 1 and 3 against the Clippers and the Lakers, respectively. After narrowly missing the East finals last year , the 76ers have regressed. Only one of the club\u2019s road wins has come against a team over .500 (the Celtics on Dec. 12), which is a scary proposition for a team that could be starting the postseason on the road. New Orleans is surging after a 6-22 start with Williamson out and other valuable players in and out of the lineup due to injuries. The Pelicans won six of their last nine games going into the All-Star break, and they\u2019ve got the NBA\u2019s easiest remaining schedule. Memphis \u2013 the current No. 8 seed in the West \u2014 has the most difficult remaining schedule. The Pelicans are 11th in the standings, but have six games left to play against the teams sitting between them and that eighth spot (Portland, Memphis and San Antonio). To date, New Orleans is a combined 5-1 against those squads. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here  , find his archive  here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

We are grateful to him for his service and we are thrilled to have Kyrie join us as the newest Vice President. Having a player of his caliber coupled with his off the court business acumen will help us to continue to strengthen the union as a whole and empower our individual voices as players.\u201d In addition to Chris Paul (President), the other members of the Executive Committee include Andre Iguodala (First Vice President), Anthony Tolliver (Secretary-Treasurer), Bismack Biyombo, Malcolm Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, CJ McCollum and Garrett Temple (Vice Presidents)."},{"id":28621,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kawhi-leonard-named-all-star-game-mvp","date":"2020-02-17","title":"Kawhi Leonard named Kia Kobe Bryant All-Star Game MVP","content":"CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Kawhi Leonard made it look effortless, nailing one 3-pointer after another and nearly matching an All-Star Game record. The tough part came afterward. Finding the right words to express how he felt after becoming the first Kobe Bryant MVP award winner wasn\u2019t so easy. Leonard scored 30 points and hit eight 3-pointers to lead Team LeBron to a 157-155 victory over Team Giannis on Sunday night. He was presented the MVP trophy that the league renamed after Bryant on Saturday, three weeks after the Lakers great and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were among the nine people killed when their helicopter crashed near Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s very special,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cLike I said, I had a relationship with him. Words can\u2019t explain how happy I am for it. Able to put that trophy in my room, in my trophy room, and just be able to see Kobe\u2019s name on there, it just means a lot to me. He\u2019s a big inspiration in my life. He did a lot for me.\u201d Bryant had a huge presence over the first All-Star festivities in Chicago since 1988, when Michael Jordan delighted the home crowd by beating Dominique Wilkins in a classic slam dunk contest and scoring 40 points to take MVP honors in the game. There were all sorts of tributes to Bryant, his daughter and late NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern. But once the game started, it didn\u2019t take long for Leonard to make his presence felt. The Los Angeles Clippers star has two NBA finals MVP trophies after helping San Antonio and Toronto win championships. He was picked for his fourth All-Star team and put on quite a display from the perimeter, knocking down 8 of 14 3-pointers. Had he made one more, he would have matched Paul George\u2019s All-Star record set in 2016. And he appeared to be well on his way to breaking it after a scorching start. Leonard hit one just seconds into the game. He made all four 3s in the first quarter \u2014 the only shots he took while scoring 12 points. Leonard was 7 of 10 in the first half, only to cool off a bit after that. He missed a step-back 3 that could have won it with his team up 154-153, but was the runaway winner for the game\u2019s MVP honors with seven votes. LeBron James got three and Chicago product Anthony Davis and Chris Paul received one apiece. All that\u2019s missing for Leonard now is the league\u2019s regular season MVP award. \u201cMy mindset is always just to try to make my team the best team at the end of the regular season,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m fortunate enough to win a regular season MVP, then I\u2019ll be happy with it. I always just want to win championships. I\u2019m not really concerned with the personal goal. So I always want to play to win championships.\u201d Leonard could have signed with the Lakers and teamed with LeBron James and Anthony Davis with Frank Vogel coaching them after leading Toronto to the championship last season. Instead, it was a one-night-only affair, with Vogel on the sideline for Team LeBron. The Clippers are third in the Western Conference behind the Lakers and Denver, five games off the lead. They could cross paths in the playoffs with the team that shares their arena. But for one night, anyway, Leonard enjoyed being on the same side. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI played with \u2019Bron and A.D. last year, and I think the year before that or so. But it\u2019s always fun just to get around guys that are very competitive, see what they do on an everyday basis. \u201cJust talking, just being their teammate. We go at each other all year round. And just like I said, it\u2019s great to be able to pick their brain and just be around them and joke and laugh.\u201d"},{"id":28640,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10-takeaways-nba-all-star-2020","date":"2020-02-17","title":"10 standout moments from NBA All-Star 2020","content":"With the 69th All-Star Game in the books, now it\u2019s time to focus on the stretch run of this regular season. But before we do that, let\u2019s look back at 10 great moments of a tremendous NBA All-Star 2020 in Chicago . * * * You wanted changes, intensity and All-Stars playing with a purpose? You got all that and so much more in Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game, the first with the tweaked format and the target score in the fourth quarter. Hometown kid Anthony Davis nailed the game-winning free throw, capping a wild fourth quarter that produced some of the greatest All-Star Game action that played more like a Game 7 of The Finals. Kawhi Leonard captured the inaugural Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP award and everyone seems to agree the new format fueled the most spirited All-Star Game finish in years. Chicago represented to the fullest, lending some of the best and brightest the Windy City has to offer to frame the final night of a spectacular weekend. Jennifer Hudson\u2019s glorious tribute to Kobe Bryant, his daughter, Gigi, and the seven others who perished in that Jan. 26 helicopter crash in California was hair-raising. Chaka Khan\u2019s a cappella rendition of the national anthem was riveting. Common\u2019s splendid player introductions solidified this as perhaps the best pre-tip program in All-Star game history. And that was before Chance the Rapper\u2019s electric halftime performance. Kobe Bryant loomed large over this first All-Star weekend since his passing. The tributes \u2014 from fans, celebrities and players alike \u2014 were tastefully done and appropriate, given the circumstance and Kobe\u2019s love for the big stage that All-Star always provides. Well done, NBA family. Well done! Now about that controversial finish on State Farm All-Star Saturday night \u2026 kudos to the Miami Heat\u2019s Derrick Jones Jr. for rising to the challenge and outlasting the field to claim the AT&T Slam Dunk title. But good luck convincing the masses that Aaron Gordon wasn\u2019t robbed of his second trophy since 2016. Don\u2019t @ me \u2014 just watch it again and judge for yourself.  With the entire NBA ecosystem on hand for the weekend\u2019s festivities, there was no shortage of celebrity sightings in and around Chicago. But a Friday NBA Cares event provided one of the best and most organic reactions from the faces of the future of the league than Luka Doncic, Trae Young and Zion Williamson meeting former President Barack Obama for the first time. It was hard to tell who enjoyed it more. The announcement of the finalists for the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame Class of 2020 can get lost in a busy weekend. So Kudos to Hall chairman Jerry Colangelo for providing some context on why the 2020 class (headlined by no-brainer picks Kobe, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Tamika Catchings) is smaller than usual. He\u2019s a man of few words, but Kawhi Leonard\u2019s actions these past nine months say it all. It\u2019s his league right now. Sure, Giannis Antetokounmpo is the reigning Kia MVP and the frontrunner in this season\u2019s MVP chase. Yes, LeBron James is still the global face of the league. But Leonard is the reigning Finals MVP, he owned last summer\u2019s free agency and is the leader of an LA Clippers team that looks like a title favorite. Now, he can add winner of the inaugural Kobe Bryant Kia NBA All-Star Game MVP Award to his recent honors. In a game filled with the NBA\u2019s brightest stars, he stole the show with his wicked 3-point shooting effort in the All-Star Game. In short, the age of Kawhi continues. In a game that featured 312 combined points from Team LeBron and Team Giannis, it was the two points that weren\u2019t (courtesy of one of most jaw-dropping plays involving the team captains) that you must see in slow-motion to fully appreciate. The word \u201cincredible\u201d doesn\u2019t really do justice to Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s block on James. Magic Johnson addressed the United Center crowd before tipoff Sunday night , but his most poignant words on Kobe Bryant and NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern came at the annual Legends Brunch earlier Sunday. Much was made about the nine first time All-Stars selected this season, and rightfully so. They acquitted themselves quite nicely. In the end, it all comes back those playing in the All-Star Game and putting their collective stamp the proceedings. These All-Star \u201crookies\u201d fit in just fine, even if they did have to watch veterans go to work in the final minutes. Don\u2019t worry fellas, there\u2019s another one coming next year in Indianapolis. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Let\u2019s just say it was Kobe flavored, Kobe-centric and with the intense finish, certainly would have been Kobe approved. This 69th edition was a different NBA All-Star Game , in feel and format and in look and emotion. All that energy swirled inside the United Center, whipped around by memories of the late Kobe Bryant . The 18-time All-Star died in his adult prime after a horrific helicopter crash just three weeks ago, barely enough time for it to start seeming real. Some of his peers and competitors and the pupils he once mentored came together to honor him and, oh yeah, play a game that dripped with his inspiration. Pregame sorrow soon gave way to Kobe-like tenacity in the game\u2019s final minutes, as the NBA\u2019s best players brought a June zeal to a mid-February exhibition. From start to finish, this was a meaningful experience, and it managed to accomplish what it so desperately wanted and quite frankly, needed. When a free throw by Chicago kid Anthony Davis dropped in to reach the target score and seal a Team LeBron victory, 157-155 over Team Giannis , everyone had a chance to exhale. How many times in the recent past has an entire crowd stood and watched two teams go back and forth on next-basket-takes-all possessions? Yes, perhaps there is something freaky about a game ending on a free throw, and giving players credit for being competitive seems odd; aren\u2019t they supposed to play every game this way? Still, fans applauded it. And the players? \u201cEverybody was like, that was pretty damn fun,\u201d said LeBron. With 30 points for the winners, Kawhi Leonard now has the distinction of owning the first Kobe Bryant trophy , an award freshly named for the winner of the All-Star Game MVP. Leonard, raised a Kobe fan in the Los Angeles-area, was a frequent workout partner of the recently named Hall-of-Fame finalist. Again, everything fell just right, almost magically so. \u201cWe definitely felt his presence,\u201d Kemba Walker said. \u201cGrowing up, watching Kobe in these games, I felt he was always competitive, and he was kind of the one who got the game going. I think we kept that going tonight. I think he definitely would have loved to watch the way we went out there and competed tonight.\u201d The big assist and tone-setter for that was provided by Magic Johnson, as the Laker great appeared onstage before tipoff and asked fans for an eight-second moment of silence. That was the proper touch and The City of Big Shoulders offered a soft one the rest of the night. Next up was singer Jennifer Hudson, born and raised locally, belting out the song \u201cFor All We Know\u201d in Kobe\u2019s honor. Dressed in a full length Laker-purple dress with a memorial patch on the left shoulder, Hudson went to church on her stirring rendition. The lyrics: \u201cFor all we know\/This may only be a dream We come and we go\/Like the ripples of a stream So love me, love me tonight Tomorrow was made for some\/ Tomorrow may never come\/ For all we know.\u201d Understand that Hudson knows the personal pain of loss; her mother, brother and nephew were horrifically murdered roughly 12 years ago and it was not unexpected to see her reach deep. Another Chicago performer, the rapper and actor Common, then delivered a lyrical tribute to Chicago and Kobe with \u201cIf This City Could Talk.\u201d He spoke about boys and dreams and cited those who rose from the streets to make it to the NBA and elsewhere. With his best song, \u201cThe Light,\u201d playing in the background, Common said: \u201cTwenty-four hours a day you put in the work, forget the salary, being in Chicago, you can possess that Mamba Mentality.\u201d When he added that \u201cyou\u2019ll feel Kobe\u2019s light,\u201d thousands of giveaway wristbands glowed gold. In an effort to roust more spirit from players who approach the All-Star Game with caution and an allergy toward playing defense, the league had introduced a new format: The first three quarters were played separately, with the winning team after each quarter earning money for a local charity; the fourth quarter was played without a clock and with a set final score, first team to reach it earning the win. It received the blessing of the players\u2019 association, whose president, Chris Paul, said: \u201cThe good thing for our league is that we\u2019re always trying things, adding things, to see what our fans like.\u201d Well, in the flurry of a finish, these were the scenes: Giannis Antetokounmpo blocking shots by LeBron and Davis \u2026 LeBron returning favor by forcing Giannis to lose the ball out of bounds \u2026 and a bucket exchange down the stretch by Leonard and Joel Embiid. Paul even risked getting a technical foul while arguing in favor of a jump ball \u2026 in an All-Star Game. He didn\u2019t get T\u2019d up, and the call was ultimately reversed in his favor. Yes, there was not one, but three coach\u2019s challenges \u2026 in an All-Star Game. On the game\u2019s final possession, Kyle Lowry was caught in a defensive switch and had no choice but foul Davis, who provided one last measure of suspense by missing his first free throw before sinking the second. Davis wisecracked: \u201cI told my team I was gonna miss the first free throw to put more pressure on myself.\u201d Victory accomplished for his team, mission accomplished for all. \u201cThe best way we could honor Kobe, (his daughter) Gigi and everyone involved is to play like we played,\u201d Paul said. Leonard was wistful while accepting the award and discussing what it meant to take a piece of Kobe home with him. \u201cI didn\u2019t come in saying I\u2019m going to take this trophy home,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I came in and made my first two shots and kept shooting and making shots, and \u2018Bron with his vision he\u2019d seen me open and passed the ball \u2026 (but) it\u2019s very special. I had a relationship with him. Words cannot explain how happy I am for it. Able to put that trophy in my room and just to be able to see Kobe\u2019s name on there, it means a lot to me. He\u2019s a big inspiration in my life. He did a lot for me.\u201d Kobe Bryant\u2019s public memorial will be one week from Monday at Staples Center, yet in some ways the United Center was a precursor. Everything he stood for, and how many felt about him, was compacted into three hours of basketball and entertainment. LeBron summed it up for every player who wore No. 2 or 24 on this unusual night and for this unique All-Star Game: \u201cHow many people in the basketball world, and also outside the basketball world, were touched by a person such as himself? I was happy to be part of this weekend.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

But everyone knew this one was going to be different \u2014 more somber, more poignant \u2014 and it was, owing to the recent deaths of league giants David Stern and Kobe Bryant. So as the date approached, there was a challenge that needed addressing by Ernie Johnson, brunch host and Turner Sports broadcaster: The poem. Anyone who has attended the brunch or watched via NBA TV in recent years knows about the poem. It is Johnson\u2019s ice-breaker at the top of the show, an extended masterwork of rhythmic, sometimes corny lines and clever, occasionally tortured rhymes that manage to celebrate, honor and laugh about the league and its history. But when the format changed this year to acknowledge Stern and Bryant as the show began, so did Johnson\u2019s task. This time, he came on stage at the Skyline Ballroom in the McCormick Place Convention Center and promptly introduced NBA commissioner Adam Silver. Next up, Lakers legend Magic Johnson. Together, the two who knew Stern and Bryant so well spoke about their friends and the loss to the league for more than 15 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough thing,\u201d Johnson had said as All-Star Weekend began Friday. \u201cYou want to celebrate the game. At the same time you want to honor these guys. I think after Adam and Magic get done, that will maybe give people permission to laugh. To cheer.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how Johnson played it, and it worked. A couple of excerpts: The road map to greatness is not just one path,  No Google or Waze apps can furnish the map, The journey\u2019s not simple, it\u2019s not meant to be, When you\u2019re destined for greatness, nothing comes free. And: The words shared by Adam and Magic thus far, So heartfelt, uplifting and real, And while memories bring smiles and also more tears, We make room this morning to break into cheers\u2026 From there, Johnson touched all the bases, mentioning Hall of Famers in the room and touching the bases of the Chicago-related honorees receiving honors Sunday. Such as Dwyane Wade, who was presented with the Community Ambassador Award and Scottie Pippen, the former Bulls star who was named Legend of the Year. Also honored: Hometown Hero winner Cappie Pondexter, a star of the women\u2019s game in the WNBA, at Rutger\u2019s and for Team USA. Jerry Colangelo, meanwhile, received the Lifetime Achievement Award for his work with the Bulls and the Phoenix Suns as expansion franchises, as well as  his ongoing roles as chairman of the U.S. Olympic basketball program and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Colangelo provided instant perspective on the NBA\u2019s arc since he helped Chicago land a franchise in 1966. \u201cThe payroll was $180,000 for 12 players,\u201d he recalled of those \u201cMom \u2018n\u2019 Pop\u201d days. \u201cPer diem [daily food money per player] was $6. The national TV contract was worth $100,000 per team.\u201d The league now is a global, multibillion dollar industry. A record 3,000 tickets were distributed for this 21st annual NBA Legends brunch, sponsored by the National Basketball Retired Players Association. Grant Hill introduced Colangelo; longtime Miami teammate Udonis Haslem introduced Wade; 2020 Hall finalists Tamika Catchings introduced Pondexter, and Bulls teammate Horace Grant welcomed Pippen to the stage. In a playful moment, Grant said of their Michael Jordan-fueled, championship and \u201crock stars\u201d run: \u201cThank God there was no TMZ or phone-cameras technology back in our day. \u2026 mmm, mmm.\u201d Pippen, like the other award winners, kept his remarks brief, with nods to Stern and Bryant. He recalled the morning three weeks ago, at his home in Woodland Hills, Calif., hearing news of the helicopter crash without initially knowing that Bryant, his daughter Gianna and the seven others who perished were aboard. \u201cI\u2019m still today regretting that I didn\u2019t get the chance to tell Kobe Bryant how great he was,\u201d Pippen said. Then he asked the brunch audience to applaud to show how great Bryant was, sparking the loudest ovation of the morning. By the end, South Side-born rapper Common was on stage working \u201cyo, yo,\u201d \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cColangelo\u201d into his freestyle lyrics. But Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s annual appearance to introduce the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d video tribute took on added meaning this year. Two dozen more members of the NBA\u2019s extended family, past and present, have passed away since the 2019 Legends Brunch in Charlotte. Among the players, coaches and NBA contributors: Celtics Hall of Famer John Havlicek, coach John MacLeod, Al Bianchi, Johnny Neumann, Tom Nissalke, Whitey Skoog and Cavs announcer Fred McLeod. Then came extended moments for Bryant and Stern, ending with a photograph of the two, smiling, from the former commissioner\u2019s presentation of the 2008 Most Valuable Player award to Bryant. There was poetry in that shot, too. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

And with that in mind, the NBA once again is pushing boundaries and possibilities by tinkering with the mid-season showpiece. The grand experiment and experience will be for you and the participants to judge Sunday when the 69th All-Star Game receives a facelift that might be the envy of all plastic surgeons. Perhaps this was inevitable or maybe even warranted; either way, the game done changed. Each of the four quarters will stand on their own and the fourth quarter won\u2019t even have a clock. All to spice up the competition, add some intrigue, honor the memory of the late Kobe Bryant and most of all, get folks talking about it beyond the buzzer. \u201cThe format is amazing,\u201d said Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cIt makes you want to play hard and compete against one another. Each quarter you have the opportunity to win, and it makes it way more competitive.\u201d The hope is that there will be a considerable uptick in intensity and competition, that the world\u2019s most creative players will put on a show from tip to finish. That would make this game \u2014 heavy on emerging and proven stars and heavier on hearts for Kobe \u2014 one that could endure. The evening will likely reflect the depth of respect current players hold for the former four-time All-Star MVP, often idolized by them as kids; some even had the chance to play against him. The Kobe flag waver will understandably be LeBron James, who passed Kobe on the all-time scoring list and spoke to him the night before he died. \u201cWe know he\u2019s watching over us,\u201d said LeBron, who passed Kobe on the all-time scoring list and spoke to him the night before the crash. \u201cFor us to be able to honor Kobe and his legacy, it\u2019s a beautiful time. Even in loss, a beautiful time.\u201d The uniforms for Team LeBron and Team Giannis will be 24 and 2, representing the numbers that Kobe wore with the Lakers and his daughter Gigi wore for her travel team. The shot clock will illuminate when it hits 24 and 8, representing both jersey numbers worn by Kobe with the Lakers. Also, expect more than a handful of players to wear customized sneakers in Kobe\u2019s memory. \u201cWearing 24 and LeBron wearing number 2, it\u2019s a big honor,\u201d said Giannis. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it any other way representing Kobe and Gigi in the game.\u201d Here\u2019s the revamped format : Each of the first three quarters will be, in essence, a 12-minute mini-game. The team that \u201cwins\u201d the quarter will receive a \u201cwinning\u201d donation to charity. And the score at the start of the second and third quarters will be reset to 0-0. But wait! The scores of the first three quarters for each team will be added up and posted to start the fourth. The cumulative score of the team that\u2019s ahead, plus 24 points (Kobe\u2019s uniform number), will be the final target score. The first team to reach that number will win the game, and there will be no clock. For example: If Team Giannis has 120 points and Team LeBron 118 after three quarters, then the first team to 144 wins. A pickup game, in other words. As an added bonus, the entire fourth quarter will be played commercial-free for the folks watching at home. \u201cAt some point in time, the energy does pick up a little bit,\u201d said Jimmy Butler. \u201cIt is supposed to be fun, though. Obviously, nobody wants to get injured. So whenever it does pick up, you\u2019ve got guys out there competing.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time the league read the tea leaves and performed some nip and tuck with All-Star Weekend . The concept was born in 1984 with the introduction of the dunk contest, which was generously borrowed from the ABA. Then came expansion in the form of the 3-point contest to make it a two-day event, followed by the skills competition. The game itself had been mostly untouched until recent years; change became necessary when teams willingly shied away from the concept of defense and didn\u2019t crank up the intensity until deep in fourth quarters. Instead of strictly pitting East vs. West, the game is now a mixture of players chosen regardless of conference by team captains \u2014 the leading vote-getters in the East and West, respectively. By evolving the weekend to cater to the whims of the current style of play and to amplify the talents of today\u2019s players, the league hopes the game will, if nothing else, become accepted by the masses. This game will also represent a transition of sorts, with a record eight internationals from seven countries: Giannis (Greece), Luka Don \u010di\u0107 (Slovenia), Joel Embiid (Cameroon), Ben Simmons (Australia), Rudy Gobert (France), Nikola Joki \u0107 (Serbia), Domantas Sabonis (Lithuania) and Pascal Siakam (Cameroon). \u201cThis game has a global reach,\u201d said James Harden. \u201cI think that\u2019s exciting. It give the fans and everyone, little kids around the world the confidence to think they can make it to the NBA. I think the eight non-Americans are showing their countries that you can make it if you\u2019re a little kid.\u201d The amplification and success of the globalization of the NBA is a reflection of the efforts that the league, and mainly the late commissioner David Stern, made decades ago in a goal to grow the game internationally. Twenty years ago there were only two international All-Stars, Tim Duncan and Dikembe Mutombo. Ten years ago it was four: Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Steve Nash. Stern will also be honored Sunday along with Kobe. \u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate those guys and everyone else as best as we can,\u201d said Kemba Walker. \u201cThey meant so much to our game. They grew the game so much. We all just have a lot of respect for them.\u201d Additionally, nine All-Stars are under 24. It marks the most youthful roster of stars since the very first game in 1951. That\u2019s a positive sign for the league, that the game is more than ready to introduce a batch of next-generation players. Don\u010di\u0107 will be the youngest at 20, followed by fellow starter Trae Young (21), then Jayson Tatum (21), Brandon Ingram and Bam Adebayo (22), D onovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Sabonis and Simmons (23). It\u2019s very likely that most if not all of these players will have multiple All-Star appearances in their prime, which many veterans are happy to see, because it tells them the game is healthy and growing. \u201cYou see so many guys who don\u2019t have the right mindset to be able to sustain a 10 or 15-year career,\u201d said Harden. \u201cThe work for them is just now starting. You have to be able to put in the right work and eliminate distractions.\u201d Of course, the established players in this game aren\u2019t willing to concede their own streak of All-Star Games. With modern technology and also a desire to state fit and healthy, players are stretching their careers a few years longer than previous stars. LeBron is the gold standard for this. At 35, he\u2019s playing at an MVP level and has the Lakers holding the best record in the Western Conference. When the ball goes up Sunday, LeBron will set the record for NBA All-Star Game starts with 16. He\u2019s already the career All-Star Game scoring leader with 362 points. \u201cI always appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the game that I love. It\u2019s the game that I fell in love with when I was a little boy. So for me to be a part of All-Star Weekend here with all the fans all around the world that we have that support our beautiful game, I never take this moment for granted.\u201d If he returns next year, LeBron will tie Kobe for second among most All-Star appearances behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 19. Once again, it\u2019s a reminder of the theme for Sunday. Kobe Bryant\u2019s reach was vast and wide, spreading over an entire generation and around the globe. \u201cGrowing up, he was my idol,\u201d said Giannis. \u201cNot just my idol, probably the whole generation, a lot of people my age. For us, he was the Michael Jordan of our generation. He was one of those guys that gave back to the game so much, gave back to the players. A lot of people when they\u2019re so great, they don\u2019t do that. There was a quote that said that talent is worthless if you\u2019re not willing to share it, right? And he was one of those guys that was sharing his talent with us. He\u2019s going to be definitely missed.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The same sort of clarity quickly became obvious when the league began to search for ways to honor Kobe Bryant in the aftermath of his tragic passing Jan. 26. With its annual All-Star Game three weeks away, and with Bryant\u2019s unparalleled success in the event across his 20-year career, the NBA swiftly settled on a fitting tribute: Meet the Kia NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award. It will be presented for the first time with that particular nomenclature Sunday at the conclusion of the 2020 event at United Center. Commissioner Adam Silver unveiled the renamed trophy during his annual All-Star news conference Saturday. He cited some of Bryant\u2019s All-Star achievements, from making his debut at age 19 in 1998 to his record 18 consecutive All-Star selections. Bryant was named MVP of the game in 2002, 2007, 2009 (sharing the award with Shaquille O\u2019Neal) and 2011 to tie Hall of Famer Bob Pettit with four. Silver began his media session with extended personal reflections about Bryant \u2013 who perished with his daughter Gianna and seven others in a helicopter accident in southern California \u2013 and about his predecessor, former Commissioner David Stern. Stern, who died at age 77 on Jan. 1 after suffering a brain hemorrhage three weeks earlier, built the NBA from a so-called \u201cMom \u2018n Pop\u201d basketball league into a multi-billion dollar global sports and entertainment juggernaut in his tenure from 1984 to 2014. And for 22 of those years, beginning in 1992, Stern served as Silver\u2019s mentor. \u201cHe was a force of nature for those who got to work for him,\u201d Silver said, revving into his reminiscences. League executives still are considering ways to appropriately honor Stern, Silver added. Bryant and Stern shared some characteristics, in the commissioner\u2019s view. \u201cThey were both determined to win,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThey could be difficult at times \u2026 and often, they didn\u2019t have time for some of the niceties around personal relationships because it was about winning.\u201d But as Silver knew them, the two men assumed a style to draw out others\u2019 potential. \u201cThat [driven] aspect of their personality was a bit contrived in that they pushed people because they wanted them to be their very best,\u201d he said. * * * Silver covered a variety of other topics in his All-Star Saturday session, including: China and the NBA\u2019s relationship with that nation was the basis for four separate questions. The league\u2019s lucrative business dealings with the basketball-loving Chinese took a hit in October when Houston general manager Daryl Morey expressed support on social media for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. Government officials in China were outraged and took measures to reduce the NBA\u2019s footprint there, from shutting down apparel sales to removing games from its state-sanctioned television network. The current coronavirus epidemic complicated matters, yet has offered perspective for the NBA to take humanitarian action same as in the past, Silver said. \u201cFrom the data we look at, there continues to be enormous interest for the NBA in China,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sense is that there will be a return to normalcy fairly soon, but I can\u2019t say exactly when, when it comes to CCTV.\u201d Any decision about staging games in China this preseason could hinge on the fact that Team USA may play pre-Olympic games there. When asked about reports that splintered relations with China could cost the league $1 billion or more in revenues, Silver countered: \u201cMuch less.\u201d He estimated the true cost, based on current projections, at some amount shy of $400 million \u2013 still significant enough to impact the salary-cap and franchise operations. \u201cIt\u2019s substantial, I don\u2019t want to run from that,\u201d Silver said. We were taken off the air in China for a period of time and it caused our many business partners \u2026 to feel it was therefore inappropriate to have ongoing relationships with us. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any sense there\u2019s any permanent damage to our business there. And as I\u2019ve said before, we accept the consequences of our system and our values.\u201d The Basketball Africa League begins play on March 13 in Senegal. Silver noted the growth in basketball and player development there from 1984, when Hakeem Olajuwon was the league\u2019s No. 1 draft pick. And today? \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine but 40 players [were] either born in Africa or one of their parents were born in Africa,\u201d Silver said. The presence of an estimated 450 million smartphones in use on the continent allows for massive streaming of NBA games, too. The much-discussed \u201cin season\u201d tournament , floated as a possible way to generate fresh interest and excitement, remains just that for now: an idea. Silver said the teams, the players and the league\u2019s media partners continue to discuss the concept with a goal that any format would be embraced as more than a one-year experiment.

Obama clearly agrees. The foundation that was created in 2014 has championed causes like the ones that are near and dear to Antetokounmpo, Paul and Love, which is why the 44th President decided to invite them to sit for what was called a \u201cfireside chat.\u201d Most of the conversation had nothing to do with basketball, which is exactly the way it was planned. \u201cPart of the reason I wanted to convene these three, in addition to being amazing athletes, they\u2019re good people and each of them are at different stages in their careers,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got old Chris Paul down at the end, the young guy (Antetokounmpo) here and Kevin somewhere in the middle.

In February 2019, Obama sat with Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry to mark the fifth anniversary of My Brother\u2019s Keeper \u2014 an initiative he launched after the 2012 shooting death of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin. The death of Martin, a 17-year-old African-American, sparked protests over racial profiling. This time, it was for other issues, all important as well. Love told the story of why he decided to take his long struggle with mental health and battle against depression public. Paul talked about why it was important for him to make sure schools in poorer neighborhoods aren\u2019t left behind. Antetokounmpo told the story of how neighbors \u2014 in a predominantly white neighborhood \u2014 helped make sure that his parents, who moved to Greece from Nigeria in search of a better life, thrived. \u201cAll I know is, people gave to me,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to give back.\u201d"},{"id":28612,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-all-star-mvp-award-kobe-bryant","date":"2020-02-16","title":"Kia NBA All-Star Game MVP Award named for Kobe Bryant","content":"CHICAGO \u2013 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced today that the Kia NBA All-Star Game MVP Award has been permanently named for the late Kobe Bryant, an 18-time All-Star who won a record-tying four All-Star Game MVP awards.

And he was one of those guys that was sharing his talent with us, and he\u2019s going to be definitely missed.\u201d An 18-time NBA All-Star and four-time NBA All-Star Game MVP, Bryant mentored an entire generation of players, sometimes unwittingly. Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam, representing Team Giannis, said he didn\u2019t even know Bryant personally. But Bryant once broke down Siakam\u2019s game on the ESPN series \u201cDetail\u201d. \u201cIt was something that I really watched,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cAll the little pointers that he gave me about my game is something I\u2019m going to take. It\u2019s definitely going to stay with me for the rest of my life. Just his impact and everything that he\u2019s done for the game of basketball is incredible. He\u2019s a legend. We continue to keep our thoughts and prayers with the families involved. We can just continue to honor him on the court.\u201d Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker anticipates Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game will be \u201cvery emotional,\u201d and not just because of the death of Bryant. David Stern, the league\u2019s commissioner during its most successful period, died in January at 77. \u201cWith the tragic death of Kobe and Gigi and the rest of the families on the plane,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDavid Stern, it\u2019s definitely going to be a very emotional weekend, and we\u2019re going to celebrate those guys and everyone else as best as we can. They meant so much to our game. They grew the game so much. We all just have a lot of respect for them.\u201d Former Kia MVP James Harden once played with Bryant in an exhibition game in the Philippines and called him \u201ca worldwide legend.\u201d \u201cWe shared so many moments,\u201d Harden said. \u201cAfter that, I went back to the Philippines several times, and those fans are amazing there. They showed me mad love.\u201d With the NBA All-Star Game\u2019s new format , which honor\u2019s Bryant\u2019s jersey number over his final 10 seasons, most of the players on hand for media day anticipated a competitive fourth quarter, reminiscent of the player they all admired. \u201cHe was a very, very hard worker,\u201d Walker recalled. \u201cAnd you could tell. Fourth quarter came, and I feel like everybody is always tired. Kobe wasn\u2019t, you feel me? Yeah, he was a special guy.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Dwight Howard said as much Saturday morning, announcing that he\u2019s here for more than just a novelty act \u2014 for anyone asking what he has left in the tank at age 34. The eight-time All-Star and three-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year is in the AT&T Slam Dunk contest tonight to win the competition for a second time; he won it in 2008 when he was at what turned out to be the zenith of his career. Howard was literally the center of attention then, as popular as he ever was and the face of the franchise in Orlando before LeBron James had completely taken over as the face of the league. So being in this position 12 tumultuous years later has the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 big man feeling grateful. \u201cOh, this is amazing,\u201d Howard said this morning during All-Star Media Day . \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful to be here, just in this moment. Wasn\u2019t expecting all this. So this is an amazing time. It\u2019s such a blessing to be back in All-Star Weekend . I\u2019m looking forward to tonight.\u201d Howard started this season on a contract with the Lakers that wasn\u2019t even guaranteed. He\u2019s had to rebuild his body and his reputation after years of injuries and ugly break-ups with every franchise he played for, including Orlando, where he served as the most dominant big man in the game. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever see another All-Star Saturday Night as a contestant. But he also said he never stopped believing in himself. And while some of his superstar contemporaries (LeBron comes to mind) have decided to avoid the Slam Dunk contest, Howard couldn\u2019t wait to get back in the competition. \u201cI think that during All-Star Weekend a lot of guys want to be ready for the second half of the season, so it\u2019s pretty hard to get those guys for the Dunk Contest,\u201d Howard said. \u201cBut this is an event I enjoy. I enjoy dunking. I\u2019ve been dunking my whole life basically. Last summer I had a chance to have a Dunk Contest with an actual street dunker on Venice Beach, and after we finished dunking, I was like, Man, that felt really good to really get the crowd into it and just enjoy dunking a basketball again. I was super surprised that I was able to get up and dunk like that. \u201cSo I said, from that moment on, I\u2019m going to try to get myself ready for the Dunk Contest. And here we are today. This is great.\u201d Howard is clearly the elder statesman in a Slam Dunk field that includes Orlando\u2019s Aaron Gordon, Miami\u2019s Derrick Jones Jr. and Milwaukee\u2019s Pat Connaughton. He\u2019s the only one who knows what it takes, what it feels like to win it all in the league\u2019s showcase event on Saturday nights. He knows better than to do anything but cherish his current situation. He\u2019s learned a lot about himself, about life and about how the high-stakes world that he\u2019s grown up in turns boys into men, sometimes painstakingly so in some instances. \u201cMan, you can never stop believing in yourself,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are always going to tell you that you can\u2019t do something. You\u2019ve just got to keep believing. It starts with yourself. Coming up into the season I was thinking, I\u2019ve got to continue to believe. I know a lot of people are counting me out, but I can\u2019t allow any outside noise to affect who I am as a person and as a player. \u201cEven with people, I feel like there were times where, because of everything that was going on, I wanted to shy away from people. I was like, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 That\u2019s not who I am. I\u2019ve never been that way. So let me embrace the moment, embrace people and just enjoy this. This is once in a lifetime.\u201d And as for what he\u2019ll unveil tonight \u2026 Howard spoke like a man with a plan. \u201cSuperman is definitely in the building right now,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about later on.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Factor in Bryant\u2019s shocking death , though, and the rush of emotions and admiration that figure to be triggered when the basketball community gathers Aug. 28-30 in Springfield, Massachusetts for the enshrinement ceremonies, and there was a chance it all would be overwhelming. Not just for the Hall and hoops fans, but for the honored class members themselves. Bryant deserves the spotlight. But so do other players and coaches, who were at risk of being overshadowed by the focus on the legendary Los Angeles Lakers guard and, to a lesser extent, likely first-ballot enshrinees Duncan and Garnett. So the Hall chose to keep the list of 2020 finalists tight, announcing Friday at NBA All-Star Weekend the four players and four coaches who will be considered for election this year. WNBA star and four-time Olympic gold medalist Tamika Catchings joined Bryant, Duncan and Garnett in the player pool. The four coaches are Kim Mulkey of Baylor; Barbara Stevens of Bentley University; Eddie Sutton, who took four schools to the NCAA Division I tournament, and Rudy Tomjanovich, who coached the Houston Rockets to NBA titles in 1994 and 1995 and led the Team USA to gold in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. That\u2019s a smaller pool of candidates than the actual enshrinement class size in recent years, which has often pushed into double figures. Jerry Colangelo, Hall chairman, said the decision to have fewer finalists this year was made after Bryant\u2019s death in a Jan. 26 helicopter crash that also took the lives of his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, including Gianna\u2019s teammates Payton Chester and Alyssa Altobelli, as well as Altobelli\u2019s parents, Keri and John, assistant coach Christina Mauser and the helicopter\u2019s pilot, Ara Zobayan. \u201cWhen we met in Dallas after his death, we had to deal with that,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThe way we dealt with it was, we weren\u2019t going to submit a lot of names. We were going to make it a small class. We want everyone to get their due. That\u2019s important, and it\u2019s sensitive.\u201d Since Colangelo was appointed to his current position in December 2009, the smallest Hall class has been 10 in 2016. In 2018, 13 Hall of Famers were announced in individual and team categories. Last September, 12 were enshrined, including Vlade Divac, Sidney Moncrief, Jack Sikma, Paul Westphal and coach Bill Fitch. To keep the list short this time, the direct-elect categories that send one person each straight to the Hall \u2013 no finalist round for them \u2013 have been suspended. That includes the men\u2019s and women\u2019s veterans committees, the early African-American committee and the contributor committee. The exception this year is the international committee, which still will select a Hall of Famer to be announced with the actual Class of 2020 at the NCAA men\u2019s Final Four April 4 in Atlanta. Said Colangelo: \u201cBecause of the enormity, even before Kobe\u2019s death, we think Kobe and Duncan and Garnett bring to [this] \u2026 we\u2019ve never had a class that strong at the top. And then with Kobe\u2019s death, it added more focus.\u201d Also announced Friday: Dr. Tim Nugent, winner of the Hall\u2019s John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award, basketball\u2019s highest honor for non-enshrinees. Nugent founded the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1949 and served as its first commissioner for 25 years. Winners of the 2020 Curt Gowdy media awards also were released. Longtime Washington Post and ESPN columnist Michael Wilbon and veteran NBA play-by-play announcer Mike Breen were chosen for the print and broadcast honors, respectively. Two other media awards were introduced, with sportscaster Jim Gray receiving the Gowdy Media Insight Award and Turner\u2019s Inside the NBA crew of Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal chosen for the Gowdy Transformative Media Award. Colangelo, who came to know Bryant an opponent while he was running the Phoenix Suns and later as an ally when the L.A. star was a leader of Team USA in 2008 and 2012, said the tragic news was staggering. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen in my long life,\u201d said Colangelo, 80, \u201can athlete passing that had the impact that Kobe\u2019s passing had on just people on the street. People who didn\u2019t even know him. In my case, it was personal.\u201d Absorbing the impact convinced Colangelo to make sure this year\u2019s class \u2013 with Duncan\u2019s and Garnett\u2019s careers synched up almost perfectly with Bryant\u2019s \u2013 received the proper acclaim, while affording the same to some candidates who might have until 2021 or beyond. Among the NBA\u2019s biggest names who will continue to wait: Chris Bosh, Tim Hardaway, Chris Webber, Chauncey Billups, Marques Johnson and Ben Wallace. The upside of waiting? Not to get \u201clost in the shuffle,\u201d as Colangelo described it. \u201cSad as it all is, we have to deal with that,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cAnd life does go on in the world of basketball and the Hall of Fame. We don\u2019t want to take away from the people here who are prospective inductees.\u201d Asked if the 2020 ceremony in Springfield might be different as well from recent editions, the Hall chairman said: \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way: There\u2019s a great sensitivity as a result, and so that leads to probably a little bit different than in the past. But it\u2019s going to be done the right way.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Young and Doncic are All-Star starters , while Williamson will play in Friday\u2019s NBA Rising Stars game . At an NBA Cares event in Chicago for NBA All-Star 2020 , the trio were brought face to face with some living history as each of them chatted with former President Barack Obama. The event was for volunteers to fill several backpacks with school supplies, and that work predictably stopped when Obama walked into the room for his unannounced appearance. After Doncic and his World Team teammates finished media availability at Wintrust Arena, they helped dozens of Chicago-area children in stuffing backpacks with supplies to donate. Shortly thereafter, Young, Williamson and the U.S. Team\u2019s players helped out, too, writes Callie Caplan of the Dallas Morning News . As Doncic was coloring a bookmark with Hall of Famer Jason Kidd, Wizards forward Mo Wagner and some children, Obama walked over and greeted them. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fantastic,\u201d Obama told All-Star Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks, who was seated at a table with Kidd, now a Lakers assistant coach, when the 44th president made his way to their side of the room. Obama gave Kidd a long embrace, then turned back to Doncic: \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him when it comes to shooting,\u201d Obama quipped, clearly aware that Doncic is already a much better shooter than Kidd was in his career. It was the first of multiple events for Obama during All-Star weekend: He\u2019s scheduled to host a conversation with several top NBA players on Saturday, and it\u2019s expected that he could appear at Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game as well. Obama was at the event for more than a half-hour, spending the biggest chunk of that time manning a table alongside Williamson and Young. Young said he spoke with Obama at the NBA Cares event and was taken aback by how much he knew about the Hawks\u2019 star, his team and his game. \u201c[He said] he just loves watching me,\u201d Young said . \u201cHe watches me all the time. [He was] telling me how it\u2019s going to turn for the Hawks in the future. It\u2019s crazy that he knew all those different things about me.\u201d Obama played the game as president and evidently still follows the NBA closely. He had no need for introductions; he knew who the players were, even greeting Miami rookie Tyler Herro by calling him \u201csharpshooter.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty cool,\u201d said Herro, 20. As for Williamson, he and Obama had a one-on-one chat , which the Pelicans star said he was taken aback by talking with Obama. \u201cFor him to have one of the most busy schedules, for him to keep up with all of us, hats off to him,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for him, just knowing us, knowing our stats. He said \u2018career-high 32,\u2019 man \u2026 crazy.\u201d \u201cIt felt great. It was even crazier when he started talking about my Duke games, him being at the game where I blew my shoe out. He\u2019s even talking about my recent games. I was like, \u2018You\u2019re keeping up with me? I\u2019m 19 \u2026 you\u2019ve got superstars you can go and keep up with.\u2019 It was crazy.\u201d Obama shook every hand, stopping to talk to the kids, players, coaches and staff in the room. He didn\u2019t take questions at the event but seemed particularly impressed by one boy who told him he had submitted a winning essay to earn the right to be there \u2014 though the Obama appearance was a surprise until the moment he walked through the door. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing like it,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cHe\u2019s a president, he\u2019s a young president who is really beloved by all of America but in particular the NBA family. He\u2019s so in-tune with our game and it was a great honor to meet him.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Yep, Big Z. The Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 affable big man earned two spots (2003, 2005). Still, given Sabonis\u2019 background, legacy and genetics, it would be reasonable to think that the Indiana Pacers big man had been preceded by, say, his own father, Arvydas, in participating in one of the league\u2019s highest honors. Someone teased that he now had basketball bragging rights over his dad, a Hall of Famer, in at least one category. The younger Sabonis wouldn\u2019t go there. \u201cI\u2019m never saying anything like that. For me, he\u2019s one of the greatest,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent eras, different players. It\u2019s completely different.\u201d Arvydas Sabonis arguably is one of the greatest European basketball players of all time and one of the NBA\u2019s biggest \u201cwhat if?\u201d stories. When he entered the league at 30 with Portland in 1995-96 , the 7-foot-3, 250-pound center had morphed through injuries and time into a different performer altogether. In his NBA debut on Nov. 3, 1995 , Sabonis scored 10 points with seven rebounds and flashed some of the finesse that stole fans\u2019 breath . But he moved gingerly and more slowly, toting an extra 40 or 50 pounds \u2014 not out of shape but beefy and land-bound, an older version of his former self. Arvydas Sabonis became the stuff of YouTube legend , separated from his son Domantas\u2019 career not just by a generation but by a dramatic shift in global and sports politics. The father was the better player. The son is getting opportunities his old man never had. \u201cI talked to my father last night for a while,\u201d the newly crowned All-Star told NBA.com two weeks ago, the morning after the reserves were announced. \u201cEverybody\u2019s enjoying it. It\u2019s really amazing for our family and I.\u201d Arvydas was fairly inscrutable in his seven seasons with the Blazers, equally quick to smile or scowl but never an effusive interview. Did he ever get wistful about the years he lost behind Iron Curtain, his skills essentially held hostage by the Soviet Union\u2019s dictates that he deploy his skills for their glory only? Few ever knew, because he didn\u2019t share. But there\u2019s no mistaking the love he has for the game and for the family\u2019s most accomplished torch bearer. Brothers Zygimantas, 28 (\u201cZiggy\u201d) and Tautvydas, 27 (\u201cTuti\u201d) both stand 6-foot-9 and competed in Europe. But the youngest of the three, \u201cDomas,\u201d took the family business to a new, higher level: first as an import at Gonzaga University and then at age 20 as the 11th pick in the 2016 Draft by Orlando. \u201cHe watches every game. He always points out a couple things he sees,\u201d Sabonis told NBA.com of his father\u2019s interest and pride. The entire family, including his mother Ingrida (the first \u201cMiss Lithuania\u201d in 1988, by the way) and sister, Ausrine, is expected to be on hand for All-Star weekend. Domantas had the hoops mythology on his side \u2014 he was born between Games 4 and 5 of Portland\u2019s 1996 first-round series against Utah. After his dad\u2019s NBA retirement in 2003 , the family moved to beachside Malaga, Spain (which explains Domantas\u2019 proficiency in three languages). He played for a junior team in that city as a 15-year-old and at 17 was vying with grown men in the Euroleague . But as far as actual, Sabonis-family development, Domantas said: \u201cWe grew up in the basketball world. My dad never encouraged us to play. We just grew up going to his games in Portland. We had basketballs in our hands and just decided we were going to play. \u201cWe never played 1-on-1 but we played shooting games. Pickup games with his friends. Half court.\u201d Their NBA styles are different, owing somewhat to age. His father was massive, surpassed in size and strength only by Shaquille O\u2019Neal. He had a reliable mid-range shot, a sweeping hook and uncanny court vision. Domantas is four inches shorter, leaner and lefthanded. But he shares some of that vision and likes to find teammates with those slick one-handed passes. He especially is a weapon in the Pacers\u2019 pick-and-roll, previously (and again lately) with Victor Oladipo, now with Malcolm Brogdon too. \u201cYou can tell in many ways he\u2019s probably the heart and soul of this group,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra told The Athletic last month. \u201cThey play a physical brand of basketball and he\u2019s arguably one of the most physical players in the league. But he does it with intelligence \u2014 he\u2019s not just plowing over people \u2014 he has a skill set that he brings and he\u2019s big.\u201d Domantas Sabonis\u2019 \u201cfeel\u201d for the game strikes teammates and opponents alike as the basketball characteristic he most inherited from Arvydas. \u201cFeel? For sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally don\u2019t see comparisons. But my family and my dad\u2019s friends, they grew up watching my dad play, they say they see so many similarities it\u2019s crazy.\u201d A player\u2019s first All-Star selection often comes in a breakthrough season. In Sabonis\u2019 case, though, it\u2019s an honor that has more to do with his increased role than any dramatic step up in performance. To date, he\u2019s averaging 18.3 ppg, 12.5 rpg and 4.8 apg \u2013 all career highs. This comes after back-to-back seasons of steady improvement (11.6 ppg, 7.7 rpg in 2017-18 and 14.1 ppg, 9.3 rpg last season). The big difference in 2019-20 is that Sabonis has started 52 out of 52 games, teaming up with fellow big Myles Turner. Last season, he came off the bench for all but five games, finishing second in Kia Sixth Man Award balloting. So Sabonis is doing what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s just doing it now for three-quarters of each game rather than half. \u201cAs far as what he\u2019s done this season, he was doing it last year,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cHe rebounded for us, he initiated the offense, we played through him on the offensive end. At times post-ups or the pick-and-roll action. The fact that he\u2019s in the starting lineup, he\u2019s getting more minutes.\u201d With Oladipo out a year while recovering from quadricep surgery , Sabonis\u2019 place in the Pacers\u2019 pecking order rose. The conference coaches needed to account for Indiana\u2019s 31-17 record at the time he was selected (they promptly lost six in a row before beating Milwaukee Wednesday ). The reserve spot was seen, too, as a reward for Sabonis\u2019 consistency, work habits and 41 double-doubles (and four triple-doubles). He also kept up with Oladipo (\u201818, \u201819) in their pact to prove the 2017 Paul George trade didn\u2019t favor Oklahoma City after all. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond deserving,\u201d teammate T.J. McConnell said of Sabonis. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be where we are without him. He\u2019s carried us.\u201d McConnell said he \u201chated\u201d playing against Sabonis when they were foes. \u201cWhen I was in Philly, he was just one of those dudes who changed the game every time he was in,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really stop him \u2014 he does a bit of everything. He makes the right play. He gets people open. He makes your job easier, so you can\u2019t ask for much more than that.\u201d Said Bulls coach Jim Boylen: \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize about him is his physicality. He wears you down, he just pounds on you and gets to that left hand. It\u2019s very difficult to handle him.\u201d There\u2019s something poetic in Sabonis\u2019 terrific 2019-20 season hinging on the newfound opportunities he has had in Indiana\u2019s system, because of the opportunities denied to his father three decades ago. Arvydas might as well have wanted to play on Mars \u2014 he wasn\u2019t coming to the NBA in those pre-Glasnost and Perestroika days. In March 1990, Lithuania became the first republic to break away from the Soviet Union. Then it took several more years for his body to feel right enough to test it against O\u2019Neal, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Alonzo Mourning and the rest.  Had the father arrived in the NBA at his son\u2019s age, league history \u2014 certainly, Blazers history and family history \u2014 might have been different. Former Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy once told The Oregonian : \u201cThere\u2019s no question that before he came over, he was one of the top three centers in the world, right there with [Kareem] Abdul-Jabbar and [Bill] Walton. He could run like a deer, shoot, pass. He would have been incredible.\u201d Missed but not forgotten, that pretty much sums up Arvydas Sabonis\u2019 prime. Even the creakier version etched himself into memories, though. During Wednesday\u2019s Lakers-Nuggets game, announcers Dave Pasch, Jimmy Dykes and Jeff Van Gundy marveled over Denver center Nikola Jokic\u2019s passing skill and searched for comparisons. \u201cWalton,\u201d one said. And then: \u201cSabonis.\u201d Van Gundy quickly clarified: \u201c Older Sabonis. And his son\u2019s a great passer too, but not like Arvydas.\u201d Domantas, though, is keeping the family business running. And business, particularly this weekend, is good. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

They were last seen at the 2018 NBA Draft on the heads of Luka Doncic and Trae Young, where they stayed just long enough to collect sweaty DNA. In a sense, they just didn\u2019t fit. Moments before NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued those obligatory caps to the freshly drafted players onstage, the Hawks and Mavericks agreed to a stunning swap, Doncic for Young. It was a jolt not only for the teams involved but the players themselves, and in the haze that followed, those keepsakes vanished. Young isn\u2019t sure if he still has the Mavericks cap. Doncic shrugs when asked; maybe his Hawks cap is in Dallas or perhaps stashed back in his homeland of Slovenia. This much they do know: Doncic and Young didn\u2019t exchange them backstage; only pleasantries. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Young told Doncic. \u201cSee you soon,\u201d Doncic told Young. Two years later, Doncic and Young are still linked, and based on the circumstances and results so far, they\u2019ll probably be twin basketball brothers from other mothers until their careers are done. That\u2019s because long after the second-guessing over the Draft-night trade began to die down, Doncic and Young are leaving marks like few second-year players have in league history. As for Luka: He came to the States a bit starstruck at age 19 and famously begged for the jersey of LeBron James the first time they met on the court. And then, seeing Doncic stockpile historic triple-doubles and become a global box office sensation, LeBron became a big fan and wanted his jersey. As for Trae: The Hawks aren\u2019t ready to put a statue of Young next to the one honoring Dominique Wilkins outside State Farm Arena just yet. But if he keeps dropping 40 points and fooling defenders with nutmeg dribbles , Atlanta might do him one better and rename one of its main avenues Peachtrae Street . Both average 29 points and nine assists and rank in the top five in those categories while playing at an efficient level especially given their ball dominance. Doncic also averages nine rebounds. They\u2019re the youngest All-Star starters in 15 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation, me and him,\u201d Young said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing at a crazy level. I think I\u2019ve been playing pretty well. At the same time we\u2019re both running on different paths and roads. We hoop and compete and battle every night. We both want to end up being great.\u201d * * * Everywhere he goes, he\u2019s a head-turning sensation, stealing the applause from bigger NBA stars, even the ones he YouTubed as a boy not long ago. The rise of Doncic in NBA fandom has been swift and somewhat surprising if only because, right up until the Draft, he was a ghost to most. Such is the case with European-born players. They can be sensational in Spain, France and Greece. Doncic dominated when he won back-to-back Rising Star awards, the season MVP and Final Four MVP in the EuroLeague as a teenager . The problem: Those players didn\u2019t play at Kentucky, or beat Duke, or get dubbed a five-star recruit, or destroy anyone\u2019s bracket in the NCAA tournament. But now? Doncic trailed only LeBron in the fan voting for the West All-Star team. Kids everywhere can spell Slovenia and find it on a map. Opposing players are raving about him and seeking him after games to give props. \u201cThat young man,\u201d said Clippers defensive ace Pat Beverley, \u201cis a major problem.\u201d Doncic is laying the groundwork for legendary status with almost every game and week. He doesn\u2019t turn 21 until Feb. 28, and after just 16 months in the league he has a slew of youngest-ever triple-double accomplishments, all while being the face of a franchise and maybe someday, the face of the league. He\u2019s the rare talent who pleases the purists and connects with the current generation. He may not be a one-in-a-million talent but those are the odds of finding someone who isn\u2019t a Doncic fan. He\u2019s comfortable anywhere on the floor, making him more dangerous, flexible and effective. His jumper, in terms of stroke and splash, is already mature in its purity. He has mastered the Harden-esque step-back move to instantly reposition himself from a long 2-pointer to a 3-pointer and create daylight between the man guarding him. He can dribble in traffic between his legs and around his back, with the left or right hand, and brings a gentle ambidextrous touch at the rim. And he\u2019s always moving toward making a play; there\u2019s very little wasted motion. He is 20 going on 30 in basketball wisdom and that\u2019s why Warriors coach Steve Kerr was moved to compare him to Larry Bird and add: \u201cHe\u2019s a step ahead in a chess match. He\u2019s different. He\u2019s got this incredible knack for seeing the floor and knowing what\u2019s coming next. He plays with a smile on his face and is obviously having fun. Gonna be a cornerstone in this league for a long time.\u201d  The nuances of the game don\u2019t befuddle him. He\u2019s a quick study in terms of flow, figuring out defenses and angles, understanding whom to pass to and when, and how to use his 6-foot-8 height for mismatches. \u201cGetting in the paint is one of my keys,\u201d Doncic has said. \u201cEvery time I get in the paint a lot we score a lot. We work on it. I\u2019ve got so many ways to improve. Got to work harder.\u201d Obviously, Doncic had a head start as a professional, becoming seasoned by playing with Real Madrid starting at 16. He won Kia Rookie of the Year but it was an unfair contest, really, over Young and everyone else, given his European experience. He came to the NBA and the United States better equipped to deal with the geographical change than Dirk Nowitzki, who grappled somewhat with the culture, language and game as a Dallas rookie. \u201cDirk wasn\u2019t as mature or worldly as Luka,\u201d Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said. \u201cDirk came over here adapting and trying to live his life. Luka is street smart. Luka has been through it. Sure, it was a change for Luka and he had to adapt as well, but nothing like what Dirk went through.\u201d Doncic blends in the locker room with players from much meaner streets, already knows the lingo and the American swag. Elsewhere, though, it\u2019s a bit more of a challenge; his English is still in development and he is understandably stoic and careful in interviews, which he prefers to keep to a minimum. He speaks with his head down, rarely making eye contact. This is not being disrespectful. Doncic doesn\u2019t want the attention to overwhelm his teammates. He was sensitive about what his arrival last year did to Dennis Smith Jr., who was initially the young flavor of the moment in Dallas. Smith was traded to the Knicks once it became clear the ball was best in Doncic\u2019s hands. The Mavericks adding Doncic so soon after Dirk\u2019s retirement seems like Steve Young following Joe Montana with the San Francisco 49ers. The transition is just so convenient and smooth, although the Mavs tend to pump the brakes on perception even while pinching themselves. \u201cI stay away from the comparison game,\u201d Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that this kid is his own player, and he truly is. Look, each month he continues to develop and learn more and hones certain skills even more. It\u2019s all pretty exciting to watch, so yes, I understand the hype.\u201d Doncic averaged a triple double for December and went 42-11-12 against the Spurs when Carlisle gushed \u201che can do anything he wants on the basketball court,\u201d and that stoked conversation about him on the path to being a generational player. \u201cCrazy, you know?\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI appreciate all the respect from players, all the fans voting for me for All-Star. It\u2019s something when I was young, I never imagined. Being voted like that, hearing from the greats. Really glad, really happy, thanks to all.\u201d * * *  The 2017-18 season was one for the junkyard for the Hawks and Mavericks who won 24 games apiece and stared at long rehabs. They were used as load management games, mostly ignored by the major networks when filling out the national TV schedule, invisible and off radar. In those situations, it\u2019s not unusual for focus to shift quickly toward the future. At one point while losing 14 of their final 16 games, Carlisle quizzed Mavericks personnel chief Donnie Nelson about the upcoming Draft: \u201cWho\u2019s the best player coming out?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Luka Doncic and it\u2019s not close.\u201d Carlisle said recently: \u201cWe got into a deeper conversation and Donnie says he\u2019s got the elements of some of the great international players of all time. He said Luka was very much an ori ginal. \u201d Considering that Nowitzki was winding down his career in Dallas and as perhaps the best international player ever, the Mavs were all-in on Doncic. Problem: They held the fifth pick; Doncic would surely be gone by then. Solution: They were desperate, which means they would aggressively seek to move up. In Atlanta, the Hawks were in the hands of Travis Schlenk, starting his second season as the architect after leaving the Warriors. Schlenk saw point-blank how the Warriors used wise drafting (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green) to build a Goliath with staying power and wanted the same model in Atlanta. The previous year in his first Draft in Atlanta, Schlenk took forward John Collins at 19 with success and was open to adding additional picks. His philosophy: Better to have as many swings at the plate as possible to increase your chances of hitting a homer. The Hawks had the third pick in 2018 and were high on Doncic and almost equally so on Young. They wanted someone with talent but also the ability to entertain. The Hawks were a soft sell in Atlanta and chairman Tony Ressler wanted fans in the seats at newly renovated State Farm Arena. Both the Hawks and Mavericks were convinced the Suns, who already had Devin Booker, would go big with the No. 1 pick; Deandre Ayton played down the road at Arizona. The Kings had the second pick and GM Vlade Divac was once an international player himself so there was concern. But guards De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield meshed in their first season together, so the Kings also went big with Marvin Bagley III. Also, the Grizzlies at four were sold on Jaren Jackson Jr. When Nelson called Schlenk and upped their offer to a top-five protected pick in 2019 just to swap No. 5 for No. 3, it sparked intense conversation within the Hawks.  \u201cThe Mavericks made the offer and I took it to the group,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cWe had 16 guys in there and the vote was 8-8. What it came down to is we projected Dallas to finish low the following year and we\u2019d get another lottery pick, and lottery picks were our most valuable assets at the time.\u201d Cuban said the wait to hear back from the Hawks felt like an eternity in Dallas. \u201cAnd then the anxiety increases after you make the trade,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to get it done is one level of anxiety, but the anxiety after you get the guy? Because look how many picks that don\u2019t pan out, who are not stars. You could see that Luka had something. We knew the kid could be special. But some guys are just rookie hype, too. Until you know, you just don\u2019t know. I just want the guy who takes us to the next level.\u201d The public reaction was favorable in Dallas, mixed in Atlanta \u2014 surprising, considering most fans and media had seen Young but not Doncic. But Young finished the last few weeks poorly in his final season at Oklahoma. And then he looked dreadful in NBA Summer League at Salt Lake City. \u201cTrae had nothing to do with the trade,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask for it. Because of that there was a ton of pressure on him. People were looking for reasons for why Trae was going to fail.\u201d The extra No. 1 pick was used in the 2019 Draft on swingman Cam Reddish, who\u2019s having a somewhat rough start in Atlanta. Ultimately his development will weigh in the final verdict. \u201cPeople will say what they want but from what I see, both teams made out fine,\u201d Carlisle said. * * * He is slightly built but not too fragile to carry a grudge. That\u2019s how Young approached his NBA career, by using 30-foot jumpers and no-look passes to attack anyone who doubted him. No, the world has nothing against Young; actually, the world has more important issues to deal with. And although his All-Star berth caused a stir because the Hawks aren\u2019t winning, he did win the fan vote which disputed any notion of unpopularity. Still, for an athlete in the social media age, seeing a dozen critical tweets seems like a million. And a fair amount of comments directed toward Young made sure to mention how well Doncic was doing and where the Mavericks stood in the standings. When Young dropped 42 points with eight 3-pointers in a win over the Nuggets back in November, he went to Twitter and announced in all caps: YOUR APOLOGY NEEDS TO BE AS LOUD AS THE DISRESPECT WAS. It has received more than 150,000 likes, including one from Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who could relate. Schlenk said: \u201cIt\u2019s just society today. He\u2019s got the toughest skin I\u2019ve been around. But with social media, anyone in the world can say something to you, tell you what they think. Maybe on some level it bothers him but he copes with it unbelievably well. It\u2019s motivation. Look, he wants to be great and he\u2019ll get there because he\u2019s a smart player with a high IQ.\u201d The offensive numbers being posted by Young are epic; good luck finding a dozen players in history who ranked top five in scoring and assists in a single season. He\u2019s a shot-making and passing wizard. Young\u2019s defense is another issue although most young players struggle at first, and until he gets physically stronger, Young\u2019s size doesn\u2019t help. Anyway, Young has the support of the one person in Atlanta who carries the most respected voice, someone also depicted as one-dimensional, yet became a Hall of Famer. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful for us to have a guy like him,\u201d Hawks legend Dominique Wilkins said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of heart and that\u2019s putting it lightly. We knew his ability and his talent. Once I saw him play in a couple of games, I said he\u2019s got the \u2018it-factor.\u2019 Players know players. He wasn\u2019t hard to figure out. You knew what he would become.\u201d And there\u2019s a familiar voice outside of Atlanta who brings the same clout. \u201cHe deserves being the All-Star starter in the Eastern Conference,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing like a beast this year.\u201d Young and Doncic are in different situations. The Mavericks are built to win 45-50 games and compete for the playoffs. The Hawks are under construction and loaded with pups. Plus, Collins missed 25 games for a violation of the NBA\u2019s Anti-Drug Program . Therefore, it\u2019s not totally fair to conclude that Young isn\u2019t a winner. He\u2019s sensitive to that perception, worried it could swell into a reputation. \u201cEven when I led the country in points and assists at Oklahoma I\u2019d get frustrated when we\u2019d lose,\u201d Young said. \u201cI had 49 once and couldn\u2019t enjoy it because we lost. Those loses stick with me. You can\u2019t enjoy it when you\u2019re a competitor like me.\u201d Young\u2019s skills are refined and surprisingly disciplined for someone who makes high-risk choices. His shooting range is deep; those 30-footers began in middle school when everyone began to grow except Young and it was the only way he could launch without being blocked. He challenges bigger players at the rim. He can shoot the mid-range, rare nowadays for players with an appetite for 3-pointers. But it\u2019s his court vision and passing that also separate him from other big scorers. \u201cI said at the time we drafted him, that\u2019s what stood out,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cHe got all the hype for shooting threes. And he\u2019s got that skill set. But his ability to make passes, with his right and left hand, off the dribble and off the pick and roll, is what makes him unique.\u201d That along with his crafty dribble, which he\u2019ll often use for his signature move, the nutmeg \u2014 a pass or dribble between the defender\u2019s legs. When that happens there\u2019s only one thing to say to the victim: \u201c You got Trae\u2019d .\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to be entertaining but I choose to,\u201d Young said. \u201cSince I was a kid I\u2019ve always played with a lot of swag, a lot of flair. That\u2019s something that\u2019s always been in my game. I\u2019d practice those things as a kid. I\u2019d go into the gym with my dad and we didn\u2019t even shoot the whole day. We\u2019d practice behind-the-back passes, left hand, right hand, stand across the court from each other, I\u2019d work on one-dribble bounce passes and lobs. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of players this year come over and tell me, `Man, you a bad MF.\u2019 It\u2019s respect. It\u2019s pretty cool that guys will say that to me during or after the game.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance before or after Saturday\u2019s game in Dallas that Young will be approached by a fellow All-Star starter if only because they seem magnetized to each other. \u201cMe and Luka are cool and we talk now and then,\u201d Young said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be compared until the end of our careers. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter  .

The teams will then play an untimed fourth quarter and the first team to reach the Final Target Score will win the NBA All-Star Game.

Fantastic showdown looms For the majority of the NBA\u2019s players and teams, the All-Star break is underway. However, the Clippers and Celtics have to get some work in tonight ( 8 ET, TNT ) in a pre-All-Star weekend matchup that should delight. Both teams are playing well of late (the Clippers are 6-3 in their last nine games; the Celtics are 7-1 over their last eight) and are among the elite in their respective conferences. The last time the teams met back in late November, LA climbed from a 10-point fourth-quarter hole to win in OT . A loss tonight by the Clippers, however, would be damaging on two fronts: they\u2019d go into the All-Star break on a loss and the Utah Jazz would be just 1\/2 game behind them for the No. 3 seed . 2. Lillard out, Booker in at All-Star 2020 Portland star Damian Lillard is, of course, glad he\u2019s an All-Star this year . He\u2019s also focused on getting his Blazers on firmer playoff footing once Portland\u2019s season resumes after the All-Star break. After suffering a groin injury last night vs. Memphis, he declared himself out for All-Star weekend and is slated to have an MRI on his injury. Early Thursday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver selected Phoenix Suns standout Devin Booker as the replacement for Lillard in the All-Star Game and MTN DEW 3-Point Contest.  3. Encore performance for Williamson? The last time Zion Williamson took the court, he made history, scoring 30 points in just his ninth career game . He\u2019s sure to delight in Friday\u2019s NBA Rising Stars game , but before that, he and his Pelicans host the Thunder ( 8 ET, League Pass ). New Orleans still has designs on making the playoffs and Oklahoma City is trying to keep hold of it\u2019s No. 7 spot as the Grizzlies, Blazers, Spurs and Pelicans all have designs on moving up . This will be OKC\u2019s first game against Williamson as the Thunder won the previous three matchups this season he missed. "},{"id":28657,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-20-kia-rookie-ladder-feb-13","date":"2020-02-13","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Rui Hachimura picks up where he left off","content":" After missing 23 games with a groin injury, Wizards forward Rui Hachimura returned last week and hasn\u2019t skipped a beat. Hachimura was one of the top rookies early in the season, averaging 13.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game while starting the first 25 games. He was a fixture on the Rookie Ladder, and seemed like a serious contender for Kia Rookie of the Year. But a fluke injury , suffered when he was accidentally kicked by teammate Isaac Bonga, derailed those plans. Initially it appeared Hachimura would only miss a few weeks, but the Wizards played it safe with the No. 9 pick of the 2019 draft , holding him out the second half of December and all of January. In the five games since returning, Hachimura has averaged 13.6 ppg and 6.8 rpg in 26.9 mpg on 51.9% shooting (and 42.9% on 3-pointers). \u201cI had never been away from basketball like this,\u201d Hachimura told NBC Sports Washington . \u201cBut also I had never watched film or games like this. So, that\u2019s why it helped. I watched a lot of games, like two or three games a day. I was imagining how I would play when I get back. That\u2019s why it\u2019s helping right now.\u201d The Wizards are, surprisingly, still in the playoff chase in the East, so Hachimura\u2019s return is a welcome sight. In his absence, Washington was 9-14 but have gone 3-2 since he returned to climb within three games of the No. 8 spot. * * * Last week: No. 1 With Zion Williamson nipping at his heels, all Morant did was record his first career triple-double this week. In a 106-99 win against the Wizards, Morant had 27 points (his second-best output of the season), 10 rebounds and 10 assists. And Morant \u2014 who is sixth among all players in 4th quarter scoring \u2014 did it in typical Morant fashion, taking over in the fourth quarter. Morant scored 10 and grabbed seven rebounds in the quarter, completely taking over the game. \u201dThat guy is young, but he plays like a five-year All-Star,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \u201dHe just controls the game. \u2026 He\u2019s a problem.\u201d Last week: No. 2 Another week, another historic performance from Zion. In scoring 31 points with nine rebounds and five assists in the Pelicans\u2019 138-117 win over Portland, Zion put himself in exclusive company . He became the only rookie with 30-5-5 in fewer than 30 minutes and got his first 30-point game faster than any No. 1 pick since Allen Iverson did it in his debut in 1996 . Every week, we\u2019re seeing more tidbits about Zion\u2019s feats from Elias Sports Bureau, and if he continues to grow at this rate, the accolades will only continue. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s only gonna get better,\u201d Lonzo Ball said of his teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s 19. Came in midseason. I feel like he\u2019s still not in the shape he can be in. It\u2019s kinda scary thinking about what he can do in the future, but we\u2019ll take 31 every night.\u201d Jrue Holiday said it even more succinctly: \u201cHonestly, man, I don\u2019t see anyone that can guard him.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Like Zion Williamson, Hachimura\u2019s case for Rookie of the Year took a hit with his prolonged absence due to injury. Still, if Hachimura can help the Wizards make a run at the playoffs (they\u2019re currently 9th in the East, just three games behind the Magic), and frontrunner Morant misses any time, he\u2019s got an outside shot. Among rookies , Hachimura ranks 3rd in scoring (13.9), first in rebounding (6.0) and fifth in FG% (48.7). 4. Kevin Porter Jr., Cleveland Cavaliers  Last week: Not ranked Last week, I gave Darius Garland the fifth spot, but considered giving it to both of the Cavs\u2019 rookies in a 5a\/5b situation since they\u2019ve both been playing so well lately. This week, I\u2019ll give the spot to Porter, who has been one of the bright spots in the Cavs\u2019 dismal season with his increased playing time. The No. 30 pick out of USC has scored in double-digits in his last seven games , and he\u2019s scoring with efficiency. In that seven-game span, Porter is averaging 16.1 ppg on 51.9% shooting, hitting 50% of his 3-pointers. 5. Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat  Last week: No. 3 Is Kendrick Nunn hitting a wall as the All-Star break arrives? Since missing three games in January with Achilles soreness, Nunn has seen his numbers drop dramatically. In four games this week, the surprising guard has averaged 10.3 ppg in 27.6 mpg, but he\u2019s been atrocious with his shot, hitting 25.8% overall (17-for-66) and 15.4% (4-for-26) from 3-point land. Nunn\u2019s shooting slump coincides with a tough stretch for the Heat, who went 1-4 on a five-game road trip to close out their first half.

Derrick Rose lived that fantasy. The fantasy every youngster in this fierce, basketball-mad city dared to dream at one time or another, to represent Chicago in a Bulls uniform and do it at the highest level. The youngest Kia MVP in league history , before Stephen Curry and James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic, there was young Derrick Rose. \u201cHe\u2019s a living, flesh-and-blood embodiment of all our dreams,\u201d Hall of Famer and Chicago hoops icon Isiah Thomas said of Rose. \u201cBecause every kid in the city grew up dreaming of playing for the Chicago Bulls and hearing our name called running out of that tunnel. That\u2019s every kid\u2019s dream. And Derrick Rose is the one \u2026 basically, he was the chosen one to live that dream. \u201cAnd not only did he live it, he became MVP of the league,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any higher than that. It just doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why you not only have to see him and protect him, you have to make sure he gets the right knowledge around him, because you know he could be the voice out of Chicago that speaks to the world.\u201d A basketball prodigy born and raised in the city, Rose will receive a hero\u2019s welcome during All-Star 2020 in his hometown. But it\u2019s not the storybook ending Chicagoans wished it would be, with Rose representing the Bulls during the league\u2019s showcase weekend. He\u2019s not returning as an All-Star, though he\u2019s certainly performed well enough this season in Detroit to have warranted serious consideration. He originally was tapped to be on center stage All-Star Saturday night as a competitor in the Taco Bell Skills Competition he won as a rookie in 2009. Instead, he had to withdraw because of an adductor strain. Still, he will feel that Chicago love. The kind Thomas said you only get back home, when it feels like an entire city can shelter its own from the cold, harsh realities they might face outside of that cocoon. But even in the weeks leading up to the All-Star announcements, when there was a buzz and still a chance he might complete a comeback story for the ages and be named an All-Star, Rose didn\u2019t get lost in the moment. \u201cNah, I never did it for that, I never in my life played to be in that game,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIf people decide to put me in there, that\u2019s cool. But if not, I\u2019m going to keep playing the way that I\u2019m playing. \u201d Chicago\u2019s rich basketball roots run deep. It\u2019s a generational love affair with the game, a passion that has to be experienced to wrap your head around why it means so much to so many. It goes beyond the city limits, too, spreading in every direction throughout the \u201cChicagoland\u201d area, which has produced some of the greatest and most impactful players in NBA history . From Joliet\u2019s George Mikan, the league\u2019s first superstar in the 1940s and 50s; to Thomas, a West Sider who is generally regarded as the best player ever from the city; all the way to Dwyane Wade, a surefire future Hall of Famer; and now Los Angeles Lakers superstar Anthony Davis, who carries the torch for Chicago as one of the league\u2019s five best current players. The list is long and legendary, filled with prep and college stars who reached various levels of fame and achievement in the NBA. But Rose is the only one to have done it in a Bulls uniform and the only one to earn the distinction of Kia Most Valuable Player, when he captured the honor in 2011 at just 22 years old. \u201cThere\u2019s a historical love that is always acknowledged and appreciated by players who come out of Chicago because of what we saw our mothers, fathers and grandmothers have to go through,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cTheir struggle, their everyday struggle, was in our face. In our house. No food, no heat, no lights. But we always seen them maintain and keep their dignity. \u201cAnd that goes into our sport, in the way you compete, the way you never give up, the way you accept all the challenges and the way you don\u2019t cry about it,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo when you come to a basketball game and it\u2019s time to compete and you rise up to the highest level, in our sport, you\u2019re a mythical figure. And for us, what Derrick Rose represents and what he still represents is that you can overcome the struggle. Not only can you overcome it, even when you get knocked down, you can still get up and walk. That\u2019s what Derrick Rose is for all of us.\u201d At his zenith, Rose captivated fans and his NBA peers from the city, past, present and future. And that still resonates today. \u201cHe was like a once in a lifetime athlete, even to this day,\u201d said Hawks forward Jabari Parker, who like Rose, starred and won state championships at Chicago\u2019s famed Simeon Career Academy. \u201cBut for me growing up, it was like he was doing things other NBA guys couldn\u2019t do. His athleticism was at its peak when he was in high school to be honest with you. Obviously in the NBA [before the ACL surgery] he was super athletic. But I remember going to Simeon and watching him practice and he was doing 360 dunks between the legs. I saw it with my own eyes. That\u2019s crazy, at 6-3, to be able to that. He was just on another level.\u201d Parker, the No. 2 pick in the 2014 Draft, said he went to Simeon instead of his neighborhood high school because of Rose, who is seven years older. His father Robert \u201cSonny\u201d Parker, a Chicago legend himself at Farragut Career Academy and the 17th pick in the 1976 NBA Draft, had always schooled his son on the city\u2019s brilliant basketball history. Like Jabari Parker would later, Rose wore No. 25 at Simeon in honor of Ben \u201cBenji\u201d Wilson, the budding star who led Simeon to the 1984 state title before he was murdered by a gang member in his senior year. But Rose was a link to a glorious past, an outstanding present and promising future. \u201cWhen we\u2019re coming up in Chicago, that\u2019s our culture, basketball,\u201d Jabari Parker said. \u201cSimeon was definitely a powerhouse program in the city. But for a while the Red West [division] was the place to be, with Westinghouse, Crane and Marshall. The Red South wasn\u2019t really a thing until Derrick resurrected the Red South and the program at Simeon, because up to that point we hadn\u2019t been a [state championship] power since the late 80s and 90s. He was definitely the reason I went there and we were able to preserve the rich legacy of the program.\u201d  Rose won a city and state title at Simeon as a junior, when he hurried the game-winner in overtime to deliver Simeon\u2019s first championship since that Wilson-led team won it all in 1984. They repeated as the city and state champions his senior year, becoming the first Chicago Public League school to win back-to-back titles. \u201cEverybody remembers that,\u201d said Heat rookie Kendrick Nunn, who won four straight state titles alongside Parker at Simeon, and along with Wilson, Bobby Simmons, Rose and Parker are the only players in school history to have their jersey numbers retired. \u201cI remember people talking about how Derrick had put the national spotlight on Simeon, the public league and the city in general. The whole city felt it.\u201d Rose was generating buzz well beyond Chicagoland by then. The basketball world was certainly aware of him, and that included established pros like Quentin Richardson, who was in the midst of a 13-year NBA career after starring on at state championship team at Whitney Young in 1998 and at DePaul for two seasons before being selected by the LA Clippers with the 18th overall pick in the 2000 NBA Draft.  \u201cThe word was out on him in the city when he was in middle school,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cPeople were talking about him even then, that he was going to be the next one from the city. When I saw him when he was in high school. It was D. Rose and Sherron Collins, who was about to go to Kansas. And it was basically, who you want? D-Rose wasn\u2019t there yet but he was on the way and Sherron was a senior and a McDonald\u2019s All-American. Sherron averaged 30 and was gunning that thing. D. Rose was more of an all-around player, made plays for everybody and just had that next-level instinct. Plus he was taller and had that longer, lean athletic body. You could see he was going to be special even then.\u201d Richardson said Rose\u2019s athleticism, even as a high school player, was jaw-dropping. \u201cHe was just crazy explosive,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cHe was so unassuming. He\u2019d come down the court and everything was so fast and sudden, it was crazy. He was playing 100 miles an hour but never changed his expression. He was so humble and unassuming. And still everybody that saw him knew he was the one. They gave him Benji\u2019s number at Simeon. They knew it, he was the one.\u201d Rockets guard Eric Gordon, Indiana\u2019s Mr Basketball and also a top-five recruit in that high school class of 2007, teamed up with Rose the summer before their senior year and torched the competition from coast to coast on the summer circuit. He said he knew then that Rose was destined for even greater things at the next level. \u201cThat was a different time,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like AAU ball today. We had like six or seven guys, at most, on our team. That\u2019s it. And we went around the country taking over every court we touched. It was so much fun.\u201d An Indianapolis native, Gordon said he couldn\u2019t imagine what it must have been like for Rose coming home after his All-American freshman season at Memphis, to the pressures of being the No.1 overall pick with the hopes and dreams of a city and the hometown team on your shoulders. \u201cDerrick made the best of it. I mean, he was the MVP,\u201d said Gordon, who remains close with Rose to this day and still works out with him in the offseason. \u201cThe injuries \u2026 that happens. It\u2019s a part of it. You can\u2019t do anything about it. But look at what he\u2019s come back from to play at a high level now. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised because I know how talented he\u2019s always been and how hard he works. He works like crazy and he just loves the game.\u201d  Rose\u2019s work ethic and love for the game is what endeared him to Bulls fans before an ACL injury and knee issues sidetracked him during what should have been the physical prime of his career. It\u2019s what has carried him through his toughest times as a pro, which includes a nasty fallout with the Bulls, who traded him to New York on June 22, 2016. There was also a very vocal segment of the fan base that turned on Rose when he sat out the entire 2012-13 season recovering from his ACL surgery. He was cleared by the Bulls\u2019 medical staff to return to full contact practice in January but never played in a game. And the Bulls advanced to the conference semifinals without him, losing to eventual champion Miami Heat. \u201cIf the people that criticized him knew him, if they really knew him, they\u2019d have known how much it was tearing him up not to be out there,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThis is a man that has never cheated the game a day in his life, not one. To have it snatched away like that, it had to be the worst thing ever. And that\u2019s also what makes what he\u2019s done since then so sweet. The boy is back to looking the way he did before all of the injuries.\u201d Pistons coach Dwane Casey certainly thinks so. He was adamant that Rose deserved to be an All-Star this season, praising him publicly at every turn. \u201cDerrick Rose is an All-Star. He is getting to where he wants to go with the ball, and he is picking double teams apart,\u201d Casey said. \u201cGuys are being more comfortable now playing against blitzes and traps, and he is playing like an All-Star\u2026 I\u2019m going to tell everybody, he should be an All-Star, he is an All-Star.\u201d To folks in Chicago he will be treated like one when he returns home for the league\u2019s showcase weekend. K.C. Johnson spent 29 years chronicling the local sports scene for the Chicago Tribune and he was on the Bulls beat for the entirety of Rose\u2019s tenure with the franchise. An Evanston native, Johnson is a lifelong Chicagoan himself, giving him a unique perspective on Rose\u2019s wild ride. \u201cThe thing about it is it was authentic,\u201d said Johnson, now the Bulls Insider for NBC Sports Chicago. \u201cIt was a genuine connection because Derrick not only was fantastic on the court, he also carried a lot of the qualities Chicagoans respect off the court: humble, unassuming, hard-working good teammate, didn\u2019t want a lot of attention on himself.\u201d At his core, he stayed the same before and after the ACL injury that altered the trajectory of his career. Before the ACL, everything was storybook, fairy tale and almost too good to be true, Johnson said. Afterwards, things got a little messy and complicated. \u201cIt was huge [before the ACL] because he was somebody who embraced the responsibility of playing for his hometown team, rather than running from it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA lot of players that burden becomes too heavy. Derrick not only embraced it, he enjoyed it. And he did it in a way where he wasn\u2019t beating his chest and shouting it. He was doing it with his play and with the way he comported himself on and off the court.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s why Thomas, Parker, Richardson, Nunn and so many others swell with pride when describing how important Rose is to the culture of Chicago basketball. \u201cThat\u2019s why his redemption to me is so fun to watch, because every time he comes here, no matter if he\u2019s wearing a Timberwolves uniform or a Pistons uniform, he gets the MVP chants he got when he was playing with the Bulls,\u201d Johnson said. Parker believes Rose is in the midst of authoring yet another intriguing chapter in one of Chicago\u2019s greatest basketball stories. \u201cMy dad has always been the one telling me about our history,\u201d he sad. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all the way back to Cazzie Russell and Jerry Sloan and guys of his era and since then, as well as players before them. We just have a long history to embrace. And all of those guys who come up are going to remember Derrick. They are going to know Derrick. And that\u2019s really special about it, because in a lot of ways he paved the way for everybody from Chicago that\u2019s come after him.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

As it taxied to the gate and Rick Welts unbuckled his seat belt, he literally froze from the announcement made over the loudspeaker. \u201cWelcome to Chicago,\u201d the pilot said. \u201cThe wind chill is minus-22.\u201d February is normally sluggish at the welcome center in Chicago because the Yukon is often a balmier option for travelers. This is not a sensible time to frolic on Oak Street Beach or window-shop along Michigan Avenue or see the beasts at the Lincoln Park Zoo who are probably under wraps anyway except for the penguins. But Welts was an NBA vice president on a business trip, prepping for the 1988 edition of All-Star Weekend which was his baby \u2014 he created the concept four years earlier \u2014 and Chicago suddenly was a popular destination in the dead of winter for two reasons: The promise of greatness from Michael Jordan and the guarantee of warmth for a sport played indoors. \u201cThank goodness for both,\u201d said Welts, now the chief operating officer of the Golden State Warriors. As a bonus, Larry Bird was in town to steal the weekend and nearly succeeded. Ask any historian \u2014 better yet, just check the hazy CBS and TBS video and listen to Dick Stockton and Skip Caray \u2014 and you\u2019ll understand why the league\u2019s annual midseason showcase was never more glorious than it was in Sweet Home in \u201988. Listen up: Jordan won the dunk contest in a duel over Dominique Wilkins. Bird proved his mastery of the 3-point shot. And the 1988 All-Star Game was played intensely with Jordan winning MVP before the home fans \u2014 but not before bodies were diving on the floor. Need we say more? That weekend will be forever symbolized by Jordan\u2019s takeoff just inside the free-throw line and Bird giving us the index finger while his money ball was still in the air and then Jordan again raising the trophy on the final day. And the best thing about that weekend, other than thank heavens for overcoats and scarfs, is how it still resonates here on the eve of All-Star\u2019s return to Chicago. Oh, what a different time it was: Jordan hadn\u2019t yet won the first of his six championships with the Bulls, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made his final All-Star Game, all events were staged inside an old barn named Chicago Stadium which had staircases leading to brick walls, and the first name of the starting center on the West was spelled \u201cAkeem.\u201d The weekend truly belonged to the host city; in addition to the presence of Jordan, it was the birthplace to three All-Stars that year: Isiah Thomas, Mark Aguirre and a star-struck Doc Rivers who couldn\u2019t believe his timing. \u201cI made one All Star team in my career and it\u2019s the one in Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m from Chicago and I made it with Isiah and Mark. We grew up together and played at 10th Park in Maywood, over by Proviso East, where I went to high school. That was the All Star team to make.\u201d  The NBA then was robust, throbbing with heated rivalries and blessed by legendary players still in their prime, with winning teams in the biggest markets and the league making roots with a new generation of fans. The 80s laid the foundation for what we see in today\u2019s NBA. Best of all, it had Jordan, already making inroads as a marketing Goliath and starving to become the face of the league. \u201cMichael was not from Chicago, but he was the perfect child for Chicago, especially for those two days,\u201d Rivers said. Also, the \u201988 All-Star Weekend was an exhibition in name only. The pride of the players involved, along with their unflinching competitive instinct, made for an intense 48 hours. Rivers said: \u201cWith that generation of players, no one backed down to no one. You respected everyone but when the game started you were trying to go at him. The game was played that way and the weekend was that way, too. All the events on Saturday. It was a competitive weekend.\u201d Welts had the job of coordinating the behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts, a task he was familiar with. In 1984 he and the new commissioner, David Stern, wanted to expand the All-Star experience to involve more players and gain more sponsorship and attract media attention. After the league stole the dunk contest from the ABA, Welts pushed for another skills event and so the 3-point shootout was added. They also created an old-timer\u2019s game but after five too many geezers collapsed from injuries it was eventually and thankfully scrapped. Today, it\u2019s often a chore to get superstars to compete in the Saturday night skills events. In \u201988, it was a cinch; Jordan signed up immediately for a hotly anticipated dunk contest with two-time champ Wilkins among others, and the shootout wasn\u2019t lacking a legendary contestant, either. \u201cGetting Larry in the contest wasn\u2019t an issue because he loved kicking everybody\u2019s ass,\u201d Welts said. \u201cBird\u2019s gamesmanship was a classic moment. He was just bent on crushing people.\u201d Besides, Bird was going for his third straight 3-point contest win. Two years earlier at the inaugural event, he entered the room where the other contestants gathered and famously announced: \u201cWhich one of you is finishing second?\u201d Bird then made 11 straight shots at one point to back up his talk. In 1988, before a back injury stole his mobility, Bird was so cocky and sure about his chances that he refused to remove his warm-up top the entire contest while he shot. But, uh-oh: Bird trailed Dale Ellis by eight points in the final round with only two racks of balls left. As Ellis watched from a few feet away, his expression turning grimmer by the second as Bird came through in the clutch. He swished all five balls from his next-to-last rack. He needed to make the final ball on the final rack to win. Well, with the clock running and the crowd standing and Ellis dreading what was coming next, Bird aimed from the deep corner and released. While the ball was just starting its descent toward the hoop, Bird shot a finger in the air to signify who was No. 1, yet again, trash talking without saying a word. And that was just the appetizer. Wilkins in the 1980s was almost as entertaining as Jordan. The \u201cHuman Highlight Film\u201d , who would finish second in scoring to Jordan in 1987-88 with 30.7 points a game, was a must-see performer, especially when he had the ball on the break with nobody standing between himself and the rim. In those situations, photographers reached for their tools and fans rose from their seats. Wilkins was an exceptionally stylish dunker, who did so with force and creativity. What was particularly interesting is how neither Wilkins nor Jordan dodged each other in \u201988, not like prize fighters. Both Jordan (who won in 1987 in Seattle ) and Wilkins (the winner in 1985 in Indianapolis ) each already had a dunk contest win apiece in their pockets. Yet they put their reps and egos on the line for a title that mostly paid out bragging rights, and with the marquee set, the dunk contest generated more fan interest than the game the next day. \u201cI wanted to beat him as much as he wanted to beat me,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cMichael and I were gonna put on a show. You didn\u2019t have one guy who was definitely better than the other. You had the two best dunkers in the game. No matter who won, everyone was getting their money\u2019s worth.\u201d Each easily made the final and had three dunks in the championship round. Wilkins dunked on a lob off the backboard for a maximum 50 points. Jordan followed with a between-the-legs beauty for 50. Jordan\u2019s next dunk was for 47 points. Wilkins did him one better for 48. On his final dunk, Wilkins executed a windmill that he said was his best of the day. But, in voting that conjured up some of those notorious Chicago political elections of the past, Wilkins was awarded just 45 points. Jordan had a chance. He missed the next dunk, but the rules allowed for one more. Getting a nod from Julius Erving, who soared from the free-throw line to win the 1976 ABA dunk title, Jordan sprinted from the distant end of the floor. His right foot straddled the line \u2014 a mere technicality \u2014 and in order to gain more hang time to reach the rim, Jordan double-clutched in mid-air. The dunk was successful, the crowd roared and the judges\u2019 cards all read 10 points each for a perfect 50. Jordan was sympathetic to Wilkins and thought the final dunk by the Hawks forward was worth more than 45. A few years earlier Wilkins lost the dunk-off to 5-foot-7 Spud Webb in Webb\u2019s hometown of Dallas, and so this was more of the same. Wilkins laughs about it today and likes to say he won four dunk contests but only has two trophies to show for it. \u201cIt\u2019s always stacked against you when you\u2019re in that situation,\u201d he said \u201cThat\u2019s to be expected. It would\u2019ve been the same if the All-Star Game was in Atlanta. Do I think I won? Yeah. But no regrets.\u201d \u201cYou know, me and Mike, we\u2019ve never talked about that contest, ever,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cEven to this day. It\u2019s kind of an unspoken thing. We know what we did that night. We know what we brought to the game. We killed it. Mike\u2019s dunks were incredible. And I thought mines were incredible too. He said later that he would\u2019ve given me the trophy, but the contest was in Chicago and they would\u2019ve had a riot had he done that. Well, today I\u2019d tell him to just give me the $100,000 he won and we can call it even.\u201d Jordan\u2019s competitive thirst was still evident the next day; in his greed, Jordan wanted the total weekend to be a ringing endorsement for him. At halftime, his team, the East, was up 60-54 and that was too close for Jordan. He sensed his fellow stars were letting their desire dip a bit.  \u201cMike came into the locker room,\u201d Rivers said, \u201cand he went off. He said, \u2018We ain\u2019t losing, not on my floor, not in my place. Ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u2019 Then he turned to Mike Fratello, who was coaching us, and told him that in the second half, only play the guys who want to play. Jordan knew who the competitors were on the team.\u201d Rivers noticed an immediate uptick and how Fratello did as instructed. Only those who were willing to scrap and dive and hustle were on the floor for any extended time. That included Rivers, who owed his All-Star appearance for being that very same type of player for the Hawks that season. \u201cWe were picking up full court on defense in the second half,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cShow me another All-Star Game where you\u2019ve seen that. Well, at least you don\u2019t see that as much today when the scores are pushing 200 points for each team. That might\u2019ve been the last great competitive game where it wasn\u2019t a show, it was straight competition.\u201d Jordan scored 40 points in the 138-133 East win. There were no claims of ballot-stuffing this time. Jordan was an easy choice for MVP and the weekend officially belonged to him, if only because he sparked a pair of intense competitions and caused everyone involved to elevate their level of play. \u201cThe game was bragging rights plus you got that paycheck for winning,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cWe argued with the refs and everything. We wanted to win, and it wasn\u2019t easy because you had all that great talent around you and on the other side of the floor. The tables were evenly set.\u201d It is now 2020 and Lake Michigan still freezes in winter, although the temps might be merciful this time around. Chicago Stadium turned to dust many years ago and the big events this year will be held in the United Center with entertainers sitting courtside, hyped player introductions and a starry halftime show. The All-Star Weekend returns to Sweet Home on a much grander scale in every which way, with a different cast of characters. If Chicago is lucky, the passion of 1988 will be duplicated, although that will be tricky since the only shot of Michael Jordan soaring this time will be taken with cameras aimed at his statue in the United Center lobby. \u201cThat weekend helped Michael\u2019s legacy,\u201d Welts said. \u201cThe whole thing was on a silver platter for him, and he took every advantage that he possibly could.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Lillard is slated for an MRI tomorrow but told the media after the game, in which he scored 20 points in 36 minutes, that he would not take part in this weekend\u2019s festivities in Chicago. On Thursday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver tabbed Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker as Lillard\u2019s replacement in both events. \u201cThat\u2019s something you look forward to, those festivities and having fun,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cBut my health is first, and I knew right away.

So hopefully somebody who should have been there who didn\u2019t make it (will go). Unfortunately, I had to be the fall guy, but hopefully Devin Booker or somebody like that will get the spot.\u201d Lillard said he knew when the injury occurred in the 111-104 loss that he would not be pushing himself further. \u201cWhen it happened, I just felt it,\u201d Lillard said . \u201cI knew I pulled it, it made no sense to be out there for the last few minutes of the game and risk trying to play through it and making it worse. But I walked off the court just fine even though it was like, a little bit painful. I came in and it was strong when they was making me go against resistance and stuff like that. It was strong, wasn\u2019t like, weak and I couldn\u2019t do stuff. That was all I needed to know.\u201d The Trail Blazers do not play again until Feb. 21, when they face New Orleans at home.

The NBA\u2019s latest official injury report has Doncic listed as questionable against the Kings , which is Dallas\u2019 last game before the All-Star break. Doncic told reporters on Tuesday he is more or less planning to suit up. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019m ready to play,\u201d Doncic said, per Mavs.com . \u201cI\u2019m just excited to be back out there and playing again.\u201d The Mavs went 3-4 without Doncic during this seven-game stretch and were 2-2 in December when he was out with a similar right ankle injury. Doncic, 20, is having one of the best seasons all-time for a player his age, firmly entrenching himself in the Kia MVP conversation with averages of 28.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.7 assists. All-Star 2020 in Chicago is set up to be a busy weekend for Doncic: he is slated to play in the Rising Stars Game on Friday and the All-Star Game on Sunday as a member of Team LeBron.

All of the sudden, the right knee buckled and he belted out a chuckle. Telling Patrick Beverley stories often elicits such a response. \u201cThat\u2019s my guy 100%,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cThat\u2019s big bro.\u201d Nunn figured that out almost immediately on the day he met Beverley for the first time during a summer workout at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Dribbling through drills to tighten his handle, Nunn could hear raucous yelling coming from the other side of the court. \u201cWe ain\u2019t even met yet,\u201d Nunn recalled, laughing. \u201cIt was funny as hell. Pat was like, \u2018Yo, you standing up that high young fella, I\u2019mma take that [expletive]. You better get low.\u2019\u201d  That first morsel of knowledge serves as one of several that Nunn has insatiably gobbled up as the baby of the crew of NBA players representing the city of Chicago. With All-Star 2020 taking place in Chicago this week, some of the city\u2019s native sons described their tight-knit relationships around the league, and what makes basketball in their hometown so special. From Dwyane Wade to Derrick Rose, there\u2019s no denying that several Chicagoans continue to put on for their city. It\u2019s why Chicagoans like former Memphis Grizzlies forward Tony Allen, from the city\u2019s West Side, unequivocally back Anthony Davis\u2019 assertions that Chicago is the Mecca of basketball . Mention Chicago basketball to Allen, and his eyes light up. He becomes nearly breathless by the end of discussing what he believes is the city\u2019s pastime, despite its long, storied history in professional football. \u201cThere\u2019s so many hoopers,\u201d Allen told NBA.com. \u201cThe list goes on and on. We can go all the way back, man, Isiah Thomas, Mark Aguirre. Shawn Marion, Mike Finley, Tim Hardaway, Antoine Walker, myself, Will Bynum, Quentin Richardson, Bobby Simmons, who else? These Chicago cats, man. \u2026Hey, I agree with A.D. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about our infamous documentary story, the Arthur Agee story (Hoop Dreams), man,\u201d Allen said. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget we were the first ones to put reality TV on the basketball side of things. Real content, man. \u2026 I just think that you\u2019ve got to understand why A.D. is saying that. Come on, man. A lot of people would beg to differ in New York. But then again, yo, we\u2019ve got a basketball culture, too.\u201d But what makes it special? The answer varies among Chicagoans playing in the NBA. But there\u2019s one seemingly universal description. \u201cThe toughness,\u201d said Timberwolves forward Evan Turner, a native of the West Side of Chicago. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be really, really tough to make it out of there. You hear about the pros, but there are so many people that didn\u2019t make it that are killing elsewhere that went on and became legends at certain universities or overseas. That type of toughness is second to none. When you feel like you can make it in Chicago, you can play anywhere.\u201d Added Nunn, who hails from the South Side: \u201cIf you look at all the Chicago players, we have a different toughness about how we play. I think that\u2019s just in our blood, just the way we carry ourselves being from Chicago.\u201d That\u2019s primarily because of the intense rivalries within the city at high schools and on local playgrounds. Beverley, Rose and Duke associate head coach Jon Scheyer grew up admiring the Chicagoans that came before them such as Hardaway, Walker, Marion, Simmons, Allen and Bynum.  But they also came up in Chicago as fierce rivals with Rose leading Simeon Career Academy, Beverley starring at Marshall, while Scheyer played at Glenbrook North. Turner, who calls fellow Chicagoan Iman Shumpert one of his closest friends, started playing with Beverley at age \u201c11 or 12,\u201d in Oak Park, Ill., he said. Back then, and even right now, regardless of all the talent permeating the national hoops scene, the focus in Chicago was on what was going on locally. Forget about trying to see how you fare against a player from Los Angeles or New York. The players in Chicago care mostly about establishing dominance at home first, they say. \u201cEven though there\u2019s a lot of talent around the country, [we would be] be arrogant in the sense of if you went to an All-Star camp or somewhere else, you\u2019d want to play versus each other or we\u2019d be focusing on trying to play at nationals versus whatever other Chicago team we saw,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we competed; like worrying about who ran the city and who was really holding it down and doing their thing. \u2026There\u2019s a lot of Chicago talent in the city, and I really believe if you can play in Chicago, you can play anywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even explain it, bro,\u201d Turner added. \u201cEvery weekend wherever you went, you had to really strap in. I remember telling people and they thought I was joking. But growing up on the West Side, the kids I played versus in the alley were some of the toughest kids I\u2019ve played against. \u2026The playground battles, going to Franklin Park, it\u2019s like everybody you knew was getting busy. So, if you were the man at your school, there were a couple of kids walking that hall where on any given day they could give you some problems. If you go to a different school, Proviso East or Proviso West up the street, you\u2019ll hear, \u2018This [other] dude is an animal. This dude is giving out pure hell.\u2019 There are so many guards I grew up playing with or playing versus. That\u2019s what pops in my mind when it comes to Chicago talent; not the obvious players, but some of the local stars. It\u2019s just unreal. There was just that much talent, man. And it made you better. If you made it out of there, you just knew you could go on and do great things.\u201d Nunn and Sacramento Kings forward Jabari Parker met in the sixth grade \u201con the AAU scene,\u201d according to Nunn. They quickly became friends, despite the fact they \u201chad always battled,\u201d according to Parker. They later formed what Parker called \u201ca brotherhood bond,\u201d which would help the duo rattle off four straight state championships at Simeon Career Academy, Rose\u2019s alma mater. Parker received all the accolades, as he was named National High School Player of the Year by both Gatorade and McDonald\u2019s.  But he\u2019s quick to point out Nunn\u2019s contributions. \u201cPeople give me a lot of credit for four state championships, but I can\u2019t take that credit myself,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI had a great team. Kendrick was one of those guys where I would have never gotten that far if it wasn\u2019t for him. And other guys, too. But I always wanted to bring up Kendrick when it came to my legacy because it should never be me alone. It should be him right there with me.\u201d Nunn was definitely there for Parker when injuries started to derail what was supposed to be a promising NBA career. There was a time when Parker drew comparisons to players such as Carmelo Anthony and Paul Pierce when he first entered the league, but injuries have prevented the six-year veteran from living up to the hype. \u201cKendrick was always there for me,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been there for him. Shoot man, anything he needed from me, I\u2019ve got him. And he\u2019s got my back.\u201d Beverley shares similar sentiments regarding former MVP Rose, who has dealt with his fair share of injuries since coming into the league. \u201cHe\u2019s like my brother,\u201d Beverley told NBA.com. \u201cAnything I ask for, he gives it; vice-versa. Whether it\u2019s a car to drive if I\u2019m in his town for a week or if his girl flies to L.A. and [his team hasn\u2019t] gotten there yet, then she comes to my house until they land. It\u2019s just a family thing. We support each other, always have each other\u2019s back. If someone\u2019s going through surgery, we\u2019re right there with him. It\u2019s that Chicago love.\u201d  Parker and Nunn grew up idolizing Rose and Beverley. Parker watched Rose play for the first time in person as an eighth grader. Nunn refers to both Rose and Beverley as \u201cbig bros that have taken me under their wing.\u201d You can also count Pelicans center Jahlil Okafor, who played high school ball at Whitney Young in Chicago, as part of the city\u2019s NBA brotherhood as well. Parker says he \u201clooked up\u201d to Turner growing up. So, when they became teammates in Atlanta over the summer, it was \u201ca dream come true for me.\u201d \u201cNo matter where I go in my career, I\u2019m always paying homage to the guys I looked up to, and [Turner] was one of them,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re [all] extremely close because unlike L.A., L.A. has so many other cities. It\u2019s so spread out. You live hours away from a dude. In New York, it\u2019s like private schools. But then you go to Connecticut for a prep school or Rhode Island or Providence. It\u2019s like that. And for Chicago, it\u2019s like we\u2019re so close together because the city is only so big. We all had the same coaches growing up. We\u2019ve played at the same camps. The Chicago culture is very tight knit.\u201d \u201cSome kids come up to you and be like, \u2018I remember when I was a shorty, I watched you play,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cJabari has come up to me and been like, \u2018Yo, I remember when I was 12 years old and you went up against D. Rose at Northwestern, and that was like the coldest game I ever saw.\u2019 I remember being at the crib and seeing Jabari having stuff on smash, and DM\u2019ing him like, \u2018Yo, keep doing your thing, keep playing on.\u2019\u201d While players such as Beverley and Davis don\u2019t typically spend the offseason back in Chicago over the summer, many of the players from the city do. They also maintain a large group chat in which they\u2019re constantly discussing where the next pick-up game is taking place or finding ways to link up to hang. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we can get some runs at UIC,\u201d Turner said. \u201cGuys are always trying to make sure we try to get back and play or see where each guy is. [Suns center Frank] Kaminsky, Shump, [Cavaliers forward] Alfonzo McKinnie \u2014 he grew up in my hood \u2014 Jacob Pullen, they\u2019re all on the chat.\u201d As Nunn finishes up his pregame rehab exercises, he takes a seat in front of his locker to ponder the importance of basketball in the city of Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s used as a tool to get out of the streets of Chicago,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s been huge for us, and it continues to grow with our youth. When the kids play basketball, it stops the violence. And even though all of us in the NBA are from different areas and parts of Chicago, this is what brings us together. We\u2019re in the same profession. We love to do the same things. This just connects us all.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

A bevy of games before the All-Star break It\u2019s hard to believe, perhaps, but there are just two more days until NBA All-Star 2020 in Chicago gets rolling. Tonight\u2019s 11-game slate has some prime matchups \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into shortly \u2014 but consider this a notice to park it in front of the TV or your device and soak up everything there is on tonight between ESPN and NBA League Pass. Although there are still two games on tomorrow night, this is the last night of 10 or more games until Feb. 28.  2. Raptors seek 16th straight win If you haven\u2019t heard, this 15-game win streak Toronto is on is not only the longest in team history, but the longest in the history of the city across any sport. At 40-14, the Raptors have reached the 40-win mark before the All-Star break for the third straight year. Tonight, they can keep all that rolling and sweep the season series with the Brooklyn Nets ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) to boot. Toronto has had its depth and roster versatility on display throughout this run (and, to be honest, all season long) and hasn\u2019t had much trouble vs. Brooklyn lately either, winning 18 of the last 19 games between the teams. 3. Bucks face struggling Pacers By winning 14 of their last 15 games, Milwaukee has kept Toronto from gaining too much ground on it in the Eastern Conference playoff chase. In losing their last six games, the Indiana Pacers have gone from being No. 5 (with a realistic shot at the No. 3 spot ) to No. 6 in the East . Closing out games has been an issue for Indiana lately and hosting Milwaukee next ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ) would hardly seem like the cure for the Pacers\u2019 ills. The Bucks are 11-0 against Central Division foes this season, have won nine straight games by double digits and at 46-7 are tied for the fifth-best start to a season in NBA history.  4. Doncic ready to return For the past seven games, the Dallas Mavericks have tried to make do without All-Star Luka Doncic in the mix as he recovers from an ankle injury . The Mavs went 3-4 during that stretch, picked up a new swingman (Michael Kidd-Gilchrist) and saw Kristaps Porzingis flash his former All-Star skills at times. Barring a setback today, though, Doncic said he is expecting to suit up against the Kings ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). The good news is Dallas was No. 6 in the West when Doncic went down and hasn\u2019t lost ground in that pecking order yet.  5. West heavyweights collide in Denver What\u2019s the best way to end this full night of games? How about watching All-Stars from the Lakers (Anthony Davis, LeBron James) and Nuggets (Nikola Jokic) go at it in a critical game in their season series ( 10 ET, ESPN ). Denver is looking sharp lately thanks to wins against the Jazz (twice), Bucks, Spurs and Blazers in recent weeks. The Lakers have been dominant against the West\u2019s other playoff teams , but the Nuggets are one of four playoff-contending squads to score a win against L.A. The Nuggets\u2019 offense is always a treat to watch, but their defense has picked it up of late: since Jan. 15, Denver\u2019s Defensive Rating is 110.2 ( 9th in NBA ) and has gone 8-2 in clutch games during that span as well.  6. Heat look to cool Jazz (again) The last time Utah played Miami, the Jazz had won five straight and six of their last seven games before falling 107-104 on Dec. 23 . Once again, Utah is starting to rise up (it has won three in a row) and Miami is next on the schedule ( 9 ET, League Pass ). The Heat could use this win as well as they are 5-7 against the West\u2019s current playoff teams and were swept by the Clippers and Lakers this season. Don\u2019t overlook what Jae Crowder has done since arriving in Miami: the former Jazz forward is averaging 19.5 ppg, 9.5 rpg and is on a hot shooting streak (54.5% overall, 56.3% on 3-pointers) over his last two games.  7. On this date: The 2000 Dunk Contest Was it really 20 years ago? Yep, that\u2019s how long its been since Vince Carter wowed the world with one of the greatest Slam Dunk Contest showings ever. Carter took center stage in the evening\u2019s grand finale, registering three perfect scores of 50 points and distanced himself from a talented collection of high risers that included Steve Francis and Raptors teammate and cousin Tracy McGrady."},{"id":28717,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-reaches-new-heights","date":"2020-02-12","title":"With career night, Zion Williamson joins exclusive company","content":"In his first eight games, Zion Williamson scored 20 points or more six times.

Oh, and that alley-oop \u2026 Williamson finished with 31 points, nine rebounds and five assists in 28 minutes. Not bad for a teenager. Only three 19-year-olds previously have put up at least 31 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists: LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Luka Doncic.

That\u2019s because, after a sudden coaching change at the College of Charleston in early August, Grant, who had worked for respected coaches Gregg Marshall (Winthrop, Wichita State) and Brad Brownell at Clemson, was deemed ready to run his own program. After landing the Charleston job in early September, Grant hoped his promotion of Riller hadn\u2019t been too effective, because now he was at a place where Riller\u2019s talent could overcome his lack of size. By this time, Riller had narrowed his choices to FIU and Cleveland State, but once Grant and new assistant coach Quinton Ferrell became involved in Riller\u2019s recruitment, and after he got a look at Charleston \u2014 the city and the school \u2014 he was hooked. \u201cTiming is everything,\u201d Grant says. It didn\u2019t hurt that Riller\u2019s Orlando, Florida homeboy, point guard Joe Chealey, was already on Charleston\u2019s roster. Chealey would go on to sign a two-way contract with the Charlotte Hornets in 2018. \u201cHe helped make the transition easier,\u201d Riller says. So easy, in fact, Grant and Ferrell were stunned at how quickly Riller\u2019s talent translated to the college level. It was the summer of 2015, and when Riller showed up on campus along with Jarrell Brantley \u2014 a forward who was a second-round pick of the Indiana Pacers in the 2019 NBA Draft and later traded to the Utah Jazz \u2014 the Charleston coaches were excited about the possibilities of their first recruiting class. \u201cWith Grant, it was just like \u2018wow\u2019 \u201d says Ferrell, who became Riller\u2019s position coach and is now the head coach at Presbyterian. \u201cWe obviously knew Grant was good, but to see it translate to the college level right away. \u2026 He scored the ball so easily. We thought this kid\u2019s going to be freshman of the year [in the Colonial Athletic Association].\u201d Further evidence of Riller\u2019s ability came in the fall, just weeks before the season began, when the Cougars were playing Clemson in a closed scrimmage. Riller had scored 20 points against the Tigers with seven minutes to go. And then a freak accident happened. \u201cThe Clemson player was dribbling to the sideline,\u201d Riller says. \u201cI was guarding the ball. But he faked a timeout and tried to drive. My foot got stuck on the floor. I wasn\u2019t expecting it and I got caught lagging. I knew something was wrong right away.\u201d Riller had torn the ACL in his left knee. The diagnosis and realization he would miss the entire season was crushing, but Riller quickly realized a year on the sidelines might wind up being to his advantage. \u201cIt was a blessing in disguise,\u201d Riller says. \u201cThere had been a lot of questions about my weight at the time, and whether I could play at this level. The year gave me an opportunity to work on my body. It gave me an opportunity to learn the game. Joe [Chealey] had torn his Achilles a couple of weeks earlier, so I had someone to go through the redshirt year with.\u201d Once Riller got on the floor in 2016, he made up for lost time. Having added two inches and 20 pounds of muscle to his frame, he started 29 games, averaged 13.1 points and made the CAA All-Rookie team. The next season, now packing 195 pounds, Riller averaged 18.6 points, racked up four games of 30 points or more, and along with Chealey and Brantley, helped lead Charleston back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 19 years. A year ago, after Chealey departed for the NBA, Riller took over as point guard. He led the Cougars in assists but still managed to increase his scoring average to 21.9 points a game, 20th in the nation. This season, Riller is on pace to match those statistics, and he\u2019s also starting to turn up on mock NBA Draft boards. Choose a metric and Riller\u2019s accomplishments are impressive. You want traditional stats? Riller is averaging 21.8 points while shooting 51.2% from the field, 38.7% from 3-point range and 85.2% from the free-throw line. He\u2019s already attempted 162 free throws. At a glance, that speaks to Riller\u2019s remarkable ability to finish at the rim and either score or get fouled. His ever-improving skill from the 3-point line has made him one of the more difficult covers in the college game. Power conference coaches would attest to that. \u201cGrant Riller isn\u2019t only one of the best mid-major players in the country,\u201d Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton, Jr. said after Riller dropped 16 points, eight assists, four rebounds and three steals on the Cowboys. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best guards at any level, period. He could start for any team in the Big 12.\u201d If advanced metrics are your pleasure, Synergy rates Riller excellent in overall offense (1.055 points per possession), excellent as a pick and roll ball handler (1.103 ppp), excellent in isolation (1.115 ppp), excellent in jump shots off the dribble (1.021 ppp) and very good at catch and shoot (1.138 ppp). Riller is a stat sheet stuffer who last month put together the school\u2019s first triple double (20 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists against Northeastern). He averages 5.0 rebounds, impressive for a point guard, along with 4.1 assists and 1.5 steals. But numbers alone don\u2019t tell Riller\u2019s story. \u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate competitor,\u201d Grant says. \u201cOne thing people don\u2019t talk about, but he\u2019s won our Purple Heart Award for taking charges. This year, so far, he\u2019s taken 11 charges in conference play. That says a lot about how much he wants to win.\u201d Riller\u2019s basketball IQ and work ethic also don\u2019t show up on stat sheets, but they\u2019ve combined to give him a chance, like Chealey and Brantley before him, to make an NBA roster. \u201cHe\u2019s always had the natural ability to score,\u201d Ferrell says. \u201cBut his ability to read the game, his playmaking, his ability to pick his spots. \u2026 He\u2019s gone to another level with his playmaking. He\u2019s an underrated passer. People at the next level will be very surprised at his passing ability. He\u2019ll shoot the crap out of the ball when he goes to NBA workouts. From an offensive standpoint, there are no holes in his game.\u201d NBA scouts have been regular visitors to Charleston practices and games the last three years, so Riller has caught their attention. \u201cI mean, they really like him,\u201d Grant says. Riller isn\u2019t letting NBA talk interfere with his senior season. He loved experiencing the NCAA tournament \u2014 Riller played 40 minutes and scored 16 points against Auburn in 2018 \u2014 and would love to lead his team back there. Grant won\u2019t begin to focus on Riller\u2019s NBA chances until after the season, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to envision what Riller might be able to accomplish at the next level. \u201cHe can play both guard spots,\u201d Grant says. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be better as a point guard. He\u2019s got great feel for slipping through ball screens, a great feel for passing. He\u2019s got good size for his position. But if a team needs him to be a guy that can make five 3s in a game and defend his position, he can do that, too.\u201d Like any young player, Riller grew up watching NBA games and dreaming about one day playing in the league. \u201cA dream, sure,\u201d Riller says. \u201cBut you never really know if it can come true. As the years have progressed and I kept working on my game, I think I\u2019ve put myself in pretty good position. I\u2019ll keep working as hard as I can. And if it happens one day, I\u2019ll be forever grateful.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Raptors coach Nick Nurse has made sure of it with the way he\u2019s pushing buttons for his team this season. Their winning streak ( 15 games and counting as of this writing) is as impressive as anything that\u2019s been done outside of Milwaukee this season. The fact Toronto has done this with a shorthanded roster and without the assistance of the reigning Finals MVP makes this encore season all the more impressive. They\u2019ve got two All-Stars in Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry, a ridiculously deep roster and perhaps the best player development program in the league right now. What they also have is the frontrunner for Coach of the Year in Nurse, who has silenced any doubters who thought the 2019 title run was strictly some Kawhi Leonard production and everyone else serving as bit players. Siakam is an All-Star Game starter and has developed into a legitimate Kia MVP candidate under Nurse\u2019s tutelage. Raptors boss Masai Ujiri, a perennial contender for Executive of the Year honors, clearly did the right thing in handing the keys to the team over to Nurse when he did. And Nurse has been spot on in driving his team to the longest winning streak in team and Canadian pro sports history. \u201cI think we\u2019re [in] pretty good spirits, obviously, and we\u2019re trying to keep the streak alive,\u201d Nurse said before Monday\u2019s game vs. Minnesota. \u201cI think that\u2019s helpful to get us to the break. I don\u2019t know, I hadn\u2019t really thought about it, the break yet, but it\u2019s coming.\u201d Technically speaking, there is no break for Nurse and his staff. They\u2019ll be coaching Team Giannis this weekend, wiping out any chance for complacency setting in over the All-Star break. \u201c I don\u2019t sense much of that, really, from these guys,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think, again, the streak\u2019s keeping it maybe more interesting than maybe it would be, maybe. But we got some hungry guys and obviously we\u2019re down some guys, so the guys are, this is like fresh opportunity for a lot of these guys.\u201d * * * Slamming \u2018The Process\u2019: The Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 issues this season have been well documented. They have not played up to those lofty preseason expectations that had many picking them as the team to beat in the Eastern Conference. But this local takedown of Joel Embiid (courtesy of Marcus Hayes of the Philadelphia Inquirer ) and his \u201cProcess\u201d is about as blunt as it gets. Player(s) of the week: The two biggest risers on last week\u2019s MVP Ladder have captured Players of the Week honors. Nikola Jokic heads into All-Star week with a healthy head of steam for the Denver Nuggets while Jayson Tatum takes the East honors and rolls into his first All-Star weekend representing the present and future of the Boston Celtics. Congratulations are in order: Welcome to the club Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had an excused absence for the Bucks on Monday night. And welcome to the world Liam Charles.

Tokyo could be the last Olympic ride with the National Team for veterans of the program like LeBron James, Chris Paul and others. * * * Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about the Feb. 7 edition of the  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Chris Wheeler Feb. 4, 2020 | 6:06 p.m Greetings from fiery Australia. Standard \u201clong-time reader, first-time sender\u201d. Now down to business. After eagerly awaiting your list on a weekly basis, I have noticed your proclivity (did I use that correctly?) to include more than one person from a team on the list, especially if said team is winning. As in: LeBron and AD, James Harden and Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. With that being said, I was curious to see where you stand on the situation in Beantown. Having been a long time Celtics man, I was more than happy to see Kemba Walker come in during the offseason based on how he fit in Brad Stevens\u2019 system, and the results this season. Without question he is our MVP \u2026 for now. As one of the stronger teams in the league, I would have no problem seeing two Boston players on the list, just as I have no problem seeing two Lakers (ugh) and Rockets players on the list. Do you see either of Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown pushing their way onto this list anytime soon? If so, who do you have with the higher ceiling? Do you side with Jayson\u2019s ability to score, or Jaylen\u2019s two-way play and efficiency? Also, this was meant as no disrespect to Gordon Hayward, who is balling out at the moment. * * * My response:  Tatum has already pushed his way into the mix, Christopher. As for who has the higher ceiling between the two of them, that\u2019s a tough one. They\u2019re both All-Star talents and potential two-way monsters as they continue to mature and add to their respective games. It\u2019s a great dilemma for the Celtics to have. That said, the general consensus among most of the league insiders I consult with is that Tatum has the higher ceiling while Brown is regarded as the most complete and more efficient two-way player. Celtics fans should ignore the debate and enjoy having both of them on the roster for years to come. From: Josh Feb. 4, 2020 | 5:54 p.m. I was just wondering why Luka Doncic is only in the No. 4 spot on the MVP Ladder? I\u2019m a big Luka fan and I really think he is out playing LeBron and Kawhi and I don\u2019t think he is that far from out playing Giannis Antetokounmpo. Lebron James is a very good passer, but his numbers are not that great. He\u2019s averaging about 25 ppg, but he is barely getting that every night. Kawhi Leonard is playing really well now, but earlier in the season he was not that great. I don\u2019t think Kawhi\u2019s streak of 30+ point games is going to go on forever. In a few weeks he\u2019s gonna go back to how he was playing before. Luka, however, has been playing great all season (along with Giannis). Doncic has two 40-point triple-doubles and is leading his team to wins. I will still accept that Giannis is a little ahead, but Luka is not far behind and I believe that Luka has a big chance at winning MVP this year. Here\u2019s my top 5 in the MVP Ladder: 1: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 2: Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks 3: LeBron James, Los Angles Lakers 4: Kawhi Leonard, Los Angles Clippers 5: Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat * * * My response: Josh, you\u2019ve got to take off your Luka-colored glasses and recognize the work of the guys ahead of him on the list. Strong cases can be made for every one of them. But to suggest that Luka is \u201coutplaying\u201d LeBron and Kawhi is the sort of thing a \u201cbig Luka fan\u201d would say. The partisan politics around here has gotten out of control as the season goes along. Everyone is making a case for their guy at the expense of whoever else is in the way. From: Jack Harrington Feb. 4, 2020 | 5:40 p.m. I am a 12-year-old basketball super-fan and I have some opinions on the MVP Ladder. I completely agree with your top four but I feel that Damian Lillard could be replaced for Jimmy Butler, or maybe even put Anthony Davis in the mix. I think if Dame keeps up his performance lately and the Blazers start winning more games, he has a serious shot in the top three. I love your picks though! * * * My response: Greetings, Jack. It\u2019s good to see the next generation locked into the MVP discussion. Damian Lillard has been on fire for weeks now and he\u2019s certainly shoved his way into the top five conversation. Check back on Feb. 21 to see if he\u2019s made another move up. From: Brandon Ramos Feb. 4, 2020 | 4:28 p.m. Defense or Offense? I want to start off by saying that I love your lists and your work. You definitely know what you\u2019re talking about, and I find myself agreeing with your points more often than I don\u2019t. Now that I got that out of the way, do you value defense more than offense when it comes to your ladders? Or vice versa? I personally value defense a tad bit more than offense (even though I\u2019m a Rockets fan and Harden is my favorite player). I think Rudy Gobert should be pretty close to the top 5. His defensive impact completely changes the offensive scheme of the opposition and he\u2019s added a nice little hook shot to his repertoire. But here\u2019s what my list looks like \u2026 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks: He\u2019s absolutely phenomenal and he impacts the game on both ends of the floor. I know his 3-point shot has regressed a bit from where it was earlier this season, but he\u2019s just playing at a ridiculously high level. 2. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers: Kawhi has somehow managed to increase his offense arsenal just a bit with an improved playmaking ability that I never thought he\u2019d develop (at least at the level it\u2019s at) and he\u2019s still a great defender. 3. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat: I know he might seem a bit high for some people, but his impact doesn\u2019t show up in the stat sheet. If you watch the games, you see his leadership, tenacity, and absolutely relentless competitiveness that is infectious to his other teammates. 4. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks: He\u2019s completely stepped up his offensive game to a level I didn\u2019t see coming this season. And he\u2019s carrying a higher offensive load than I thought he would considering how inconsistent Kristaps Porzingis has been this season. I think he deserves high praise for his efforts. 5. James Harden\/LeBron James: I\u2019m not too high on their individual seasons this year, but they\u2019re amazing nonetheless. Both also have the assistance of a fellow superstar (Westbrook\/AD) and are fantastic offensive players. 6. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz 7. Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics 8. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 9. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers 10. Domantas Sabonis, Indiana Pacers * * * My response: Thanks for the kind words, Brandon, but I knew there was a catch. I guess like most people, I tend to place a higher value on offense than I do defense. I think we\u2019ve been conditioned to value offense over defense throughout the years, even if it wasn\u2019t done on purpose. But the scoring leader always seems to draw more attention than the Kia Defensive Player of the Year. I\u2019m not sure if you can eliminate that subconscious bias that is routinely applied. But I appreciate you raising the question. From:  Joseph Paolino Feb. 4, 2020 | 6:44 p.m. I wanted to share how I have been evaluating the MVP race based solely on numbers. I begin by extracting the statistics of all NBA players this season. Then I remove all players who currently do not qualify for MVP voting (58 out of 82 games (~70.7%) is required, so any player who hasn\u2019t played 70.7% of their team\u2019s games is removed. I also remove any player averaging less than 24 mpg, as I am really only looking to compare the players who are making a significant impact every game they play. After doing this based on the most up to date stats, there were 149 players remaining. I focus only on five per-game statistics: Points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. I sort each of the categories and assign point values from 149 to 1. So, the guy with the highest ppg gets a value of 149, the second-highest gets 148 and so on. I do this for all five categories, then add up the totals and see who\u2019s on top. To factor in winning, I multiply the final player value by the team\u2019s winning percentage (plus 1). For instance, Giannis had a total value of 660 and the Bucks have a winning percentage of 85.7. So, I multiply 660 x 1.857 to get Giannis\u2019 total consideration for MVP. I also am a big believer in the best ability is availability, so I like to factor in games played as well. I take the above value and multiply it by the percentage of games the player has played for his team. (FYI, Kawhi has played in 76% of the Clippers\u2019 games this year, and anybody who doesn\u2019t play in one out of every four games should receive much less consideration than guys who impact 90+% of their team\u2019s games). It\u2019s not perfect and I\u2019m still tweaking the formula to try to make it more accurate, but here is how my ladder looks based on the stats: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo: 1126 pts 2. LeBron James: 1079 pts 3. James Harden: 1029 pts 4. Nikola Jokic: 1023 pts 5. Bam Adebayo: 1015 pts 6. Anthony Davis: 977 pts 7. Ben Simmons: 961 pts 8. Jimmy Butler: 926 pts 9. Jayson Tatum: 901 pts 10. Russell Westbrook: 879 pts 11. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: 851 pts 12. Kawhi Leonard: 836 pts 13. Domantas Sabonis: 787 pts 14. Will Barton: 777 pts 15. Pascal Siakam: 775 pts (Luka Doncic was No. 16, Rudy Gobert No. 20, Donovan Mitchell No. 22, Chris Paul No. 23, Damian Lillard No. 24 and Kemba Walker No. 25 by my calculations.) I think the top end is decently accurate and I will keep tweaking it to see if it gets any better. One side note: I am a hardcore Celtics fan, and watch every minute of every game. If you are going to consider any Celtic for MVP, it should be Tatum. He has truly been the best player for them factoring in both ends of the floor and games played. * * * My response:  That\u2019s a lot to digest, Joseph. Thanks for putting in the work because it was a nice empirical wrinkle to add to an already full load of data that we all consume trying to understand the game. It is interesting to see how high guys like Adebayo and Gilgeous-Alexander are on your list. Again, I think there is something to be said for the alternative views (something other than just raw or simple advanced stats). The best part is that there really is no wrong answer. We can all apply whatever elements we\u2019d like to make a case. Perhaps some enterprising genius such as yourself with come up with a foolproof formula for picking the Kia MVP. When you do, I want to see it here first. From:  Nick Feb. 3, 2020 | 10:42 p.m. Love your MVP lists and questions and I\u2019m a loyal reader every week. Was curious to get your thoughts on a variation of the Kia MVP question: who are the top 10 \u2018best\u2019 NBA players in the game right now? Here are my stipulations: 1. Pretend you get the player starting now for rest of season. The rest of roster around him will be random. 2. Don\u2019t include Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant. Here\u2019s my list: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. James Harden 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Anthony Davis 7. Luka Doncic 8. Damian Lillard 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Paul George Next up: Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Joel Embiid * * * My response:  This is a great exercise, Nick and it\u2019s totally subjective, of course, But I like it and I\u2019ll play along: Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, Paul George, AD, Luka, Lillard, Harden, Jokic, Butler. My next up: Tatum, Russell Westbrook, Siakam, Kemba, Trae Young From: MacLean Delehanty Feb. 5, 2020 | 9:06 p.m. I first of all would like to say that I think you do a great job with your MVP Ladder. But, I have seen some people hate on Giannis in some of the Mailbag issues and I would like to comment. Giannis has stats that no one has ever averaged, with per 36 stats of 35 ppg, 15 rpg and 6.5 apg. These numbers are better than the players he is often compared to like Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Wilt Chamberlain. The best per-36 season Chamberlain had was as follows: 37 ppg, 19 rpg and 2 apg. These numbers are very comparable and Giannis is one of the most dominant players inside since Wilt. He also helps his team get better and he creates plenty of opportunities for his teammates. * * * My response: You are preaching to the choir, MacLean. I don\u2019t get the folks always trying to poke holes in \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d game. He\u2019s doing crazy things on the regular and his consistency is what really sticks out. He\u2019s doing it without being a proficient shooter from distance in an era where that\u2019s become the real game-changer for the bulk of the league\u2019s superstars. From: Xander Feb. 7, 2020 | 1:17 p.m. Ouch! Alright, you got me there on the last MVP mailbag mail. That was my bad. But I\u2019m back to talk about a guy who I asked you about before: Brandon Ingram. He\u2019s officially an All-Star, a strong candidate for Kia Most Improved Player, and to this day I still believe he deserves to be on that MVP Ladder. Last time I asked you about him, the Pelicans were 6-21 and needed to win more games. Now they are 21-31(by the time I\u2019m writing this) and, with Zion Williamson back, have a great chance to make a playoff push. Brandon\u2019s 24.9 ppg, 6.4 rpg and 4.3 apg (and his improving field goal percentage) means he definitely deserves another look into his case for a spot on the MVP Ladder. * * * My response: It\u2019s all in good fun, Xander. And Ingram has done nothing but turn heads with his play this season. He\u2019s very deserving of the All-Star bid he earned and I\u2019m looking forward to see how he performs in the big game. I\u2019m even more intrigued by what he and Zion can become as a tandem in New Orleans the rest of this season and into the future. I know coach Alvin Gentry has to be just as intrigued by what can be done with two guys with their unique talents. From: Noah Forman Feb. 7, 2020 | 6:34 p.m. I\u2019m a big Jokic fan and I saw your interview and profile of him before the season (that man does not like to be interviewed) and I noticed how you kept him on your MVP ladder even as he stumbled to a slow start this season. Was that out of respect and faith that he would regain his form? Were you avoiding backing off of your take in the profile? Or did you really feel he was playing like a top 15 guy? In Wednesday\u2019s win over the Jazz \u2014 after key injuries and Denver\u2019s trades \u2014 the Nuggets rolled with five rotation players plus two backups off the literal end of their bench against Gobert and a fully healthy Jazz rotation as \u201cThe Joker\u201d had 30-20-10 . I was disappointed that it was overshadowed by other NBA news, but lo and behold, you put him in the top five of your latest MVP Ladder. T hanks for giving the Joker his props. Commentators often say that the great small-market team is being underestimated, but it\u2019s more that they\u2019re forgotten. Since December, Jokic\u2019s stats and impact have been climbing steadily. His recent play is MVP stuff. Butler has been great all season, so I understand him getting a spot above Jokic this week, but if Jokic keeps lifting his team up like this, that\u2019s my MVP. * * * My response: I hadn\u2019t given any though to keeping Jokic or anyone on the Ladder based on any story I\u2019ve done about them. But your question is good one. I felt like Jokic was still performing at a high level even when he clearly wasn\u2019t in the sort of physical condition anyone expected from him, given the expectations that come with being a first-team All-NBA pick. I wish I had the foresight to be as calculating as your questions suggests. Unfortunately, that was not the case here. Jokic is the best big man in the league right now, in my estimation. From: An NBA Fan Feb. 7, 2020 | 5:39 p.m. I am a frequent visitor of NBA.com and wanted to reach out to you regarding the latest iteration of the MVP Ladder. I think James Harden is ranked too high at No. 11. His team is just in fourth place in the West and he\u2019s averaging 35 ppg \u2014 which is down from last year. He\u2019s not even the second-best player on his own team. I think PJ Tucker is the second-best player behind Russell Westbrook because he plays center vs other team\u2019s big men every night. Y ou are a veteran NBA writer, of course, and have the leeway to do the hard thing and remove James Harden from your rankings altogether. * * * My response: It gets confusing around here sometimes. Harden is too high. Harden is too low. Harden doesn\u2019t belong on the list at all. And Harden is the clear cut No. 1 player in the league. I\u2019ll let the Feb. 21 MVP Ladder speak for itself. From: Jack Keane Feb. 7, 2020 | 5:31 p.m. The list is pretty good this week, but I have 2 questions: Why is Damian so low on the list after his past tear? I get that his team should be producing a little more but you have to acknowledge the numbers he\u2019s been putting up. Also, why Kawhi is so low when he doesn\u2019t play a ton of games because of load management? He got a triple-double recently \u2026 so what? A couple players in the league are almost averaging a triple-double. * * * My response: Lillard is rising based on his performance and the strength of him leading the Trail Blazers back into the playoff picture. Kawhi\u2019s abilities should be above reproach by now. From: Mason Pelletier Feb. 7, 2020 | 4:13 p.m. Your list is pretty spot on but Russell Westbrook is very low on this list and Jayson Tatum deserves more recognition. Westbrook has been the catalyst for the Rockets for most of 2020. At the time of this email, the Rockets are in fourth place in the West and just beat the Lakers for their fourth straight win. Westbrook has been the biggest reason why Houston has been surging recently, and will most likely continue this streak as he is the perfect player that fits in this new small-ball system. Westbrook has not gotten the credit he deserves since moving over to Houston, and now that Harden is in a slump, it\u2019s given him a chance to put up MVP numbers.  Tatum has been the best player on the Celtics. His offensive output has been incredible in the past month and his defense is criminally underrated. Advanced stats love him, and his impact goes even farther than that. Boston is exceeding expectations, and so is Tatum. I know he is not the sole reason that the Celtics are winning, but he is by far their most impactful player. * * * My response:  You are a Westbrook guy, Mason, that\u2019s clear. Hard to argue against what he\u2019s done the past month or so as he looks extremely comfortable in that Rockets uniform. To think: there were many who wondered how he and Harden would co-exist. I maintain that when great players \u2014 true superstars \u2014 are forced to work together they always find a way. The Rockets\u2019 superstars have done exactly that. From: Adnan Feb. 7, 2020 | 5:26 p.m. I always check your MVP ladder and then I look at team records and individual stats to form my own opinion. But this week I had to try to get a hold of you. You do not have Harden in the top 10!? This has to be a joke. He is first in scoring by a wide margin, second in efficiency and his team is in the top four in the tough West! Harden is top five \u2026 if not top three. * * * My response: Harden\u2019s struggled for weeks Adnan. If you\u2019re as big a Harden fan as your email suggests, you know that better than any casual observer who is eyeballing his raw stats and scanning box scores. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t work his way back into that top five mix. But as of last week\u2019s update, he wasn\u2019t in the top 10. It happens, even to the guy leading the league in scoring (which last I checked was part of the game but not everything). From: Landon Bangerter Feb. 7, 2020 | 2:44 p.m. I still disagree with your Middleton assessment. He deserves to be mentioned in the conversation after seeing how valuable he is for the Bucks. But I won\u2019t cross that bridge again. My biggest disagreement this week is where Harden is. I understood why he was lower on your list (even though I disagreed), being completely out of the top 10 this week is crazy. I understand Westbrook has been great this past week or so, but over the course of the whole season, Harden has been comfortably Houston\u2019s most valuable player and still should be in the top 5. Here are my rankings: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Anthony Davis 5. Nikola Jokic 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks 8. Khris Middleton, Milwaukee Bucks 9. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat 10. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers * * * My response: You consistency is impressive, Landon. Few people weigh in as thoroughly and consistently as you have this season. Hope you don\u2019t get in trouble at your day job for all you do for the MVP ecosystem we\u2019ve cultivated around here. We\u2019re going to agree to disagree on both Middleton and Harden, for now. And I think you\u2019re underrating both Butler and Lillard on your list. From: Mike Feb. 7, 2020 | 11:52 a.m. Do you hate Harden? I don\u2019t know how you set the ranking, but a guy who averages 35 ppg this season with the Rockets as the fourth seed in the West and you put him out if top 10?  Sorry, but I don\u2019t understand you. * * * My response: You are not alone, Mike. I\u2019m often misunderstood. But I was serious with the top 10 last week. No one is slotted on the Ladder based on reputation without a body of current work to bolster their cause. Harden saw some major slippage in his performance for an extended stretch. Several other guys stepped up dramatically and the top 10 reflected as much. No hate. From: Ilyas Munzir Feb. 8, 2020 | 1:19 p.m. I would like to inform you that there may have a mistake with your recent MVP Ladder: Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard was not placed in the top five. Considering his recent performances, one cannot simply fail to include him in their top 5. So, I wanted to bring this mishap to your attention, just as any self-respecting NBA fan would. * * * My response: Any time you hit us with the man\u2019s legal name, Ilyas, I know it\u2019s serious. From: Kaden Schroeder Feb. 8, 2020 | 12 p.m. I just wanted to say I love your articles and that you should continue writing them! I don\u2019t always agree with you (because I\u2019m a Rockets fan), but it\u2019s always fun to see your predictions. I also wanted to request an article \u2014 your seven award predictions and your playoff predictions! * * * My response: I won\u2019t even begin to predict what happens on Wednesday night, let alone the entire awards season and the entire playoffs. Whatever transpires between now and mid-April, we should all buckle up for what should be a wild postseason. From: Noah Bodzin Feb. 8, 2020 | 11:17 a.m. How is Dame not higher on the MVP ladder? He has been scoring 40-plus almost every night for a while now and they have beat multiple opponents with winning records recently. I feel like his impact and performance this season definitely deserves a spot in the top five if not the top three. Other players, like Jokic, can have a really good night and move up multiple spots on the ladder. But with Lillard playing as consistently amazing as he has been, I feel like he doesn\u2019t get enough recognition. * * * My response: Noah, thanks for writing. Dame has been unreal lately. But I cannot in good faith vault him over guys who have been crushing it all season compared to his recent torrid stretch. I think he\u2019s slotted appropriately, given where the Blazers were a month ago. And if he keeps it up, he\u2019ll find himself in the top five when it\u2019s all said and done. But you can\u2019t ignore the work the guys above him have done all season, either. This is a competitive and fluid competition, for sure. Check out the Kia MVP Ladder on Feb. 21 to see where Lillard is slotted. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

A terrific showdown in Philly \u2026 With just three days to go until NBA All-Star 2020 , it\u2019s hard not to get excited about the looming parade of superstars. Three of the players in the All-Star Game \u2014 Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons \u2014 will be on the court for tonight\u2019s Clippers-Sixers showdown ( 7 ET, TNT ). Throw in that this is the first time Embiid, Simmons and Co. have faced off against Leonard since the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals and this game gets an added level of intrigue. Keep an eye on the Sixers\u2019 Furkan Korkmaz, who has been hot of late and is coming off back-to-back 30-point games. 2. \u2026 And another one in Houston, too  Lest you think the All-Star fun is only reserved for an East coast game, the Rockets and Celtics meet ( 9:30 ET, TNT ) in a game featuring four more All-Stars (Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, James Harden and Russell Westbrook). Walker has lost his last three matchups to Westbrook-led teams, but this marks the first time they\u2019re going at each other with their new squads. Harden\u2019s scoring is still down a bit (27.5 ppg over his last 15 games) while Westbrook\u2019s is rising (35.7 ppg in last seven games). Tatum, the newest East Player of the Week , is surging in his efficiency since Dec. 1, particularly when it comes to drives to the hoop . 3. Williamson ready to return vs. Blazers All throughout his injury rehab process, Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson has embraced the long-term view when it comes to playing or not. He was held out of Saturday\u2019s win against the Pacers because of a sprained right ankle, but is fully expected to suit up against Portland ( 8 ET, League Pass ). This matchup could be decided by 3-pointers, though, as both teams are in the Top 5 in 3-point percentage and the Top 10 in 3-pointers made per game . Over the last 10 games, no one has shot 3-pointers better than Portland (43.1%) and, not surprisingly, the Blazers are 7-3 during that stretch. 4. On this date: Iverson\u2019s first All-Star MVP In one of the greatest comebacks in All-Star Game history, the Eastern Conference stormed back from a 21-point deficit to the Western Conference in the game\u2019s final nine minutes to claim a 111-110 victory. Allen Iverson won the first of his two career All-Star Game MVPs (the other came in 2005) by scoring 15 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter to power the East\u2019s big rally. 5. The legend of Dr. Jerry Buss As the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers from 1979-2013, Dr. Jerry Buss oversaw one of the greatest stretches in sports and entertainment history.

So with legs pumping, head down, the lanky forward from Westinghouse High School pushed hard down a back street in the West Side neighborhood where he spent his teenage years. He sprinted until he got the sense that, hmm, he no longer was alone. \u201cI ran into a gang meeting, it was probably 1,000 guys deep,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey looked at me, and some of them were getting ready to get physical.\u201d Yikes. From what he describes, you conjure up Cyrus and the \u201cCan you dig it?!\u201d scene from \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d Only instead of the Baseball Furies or the Rogues, this was real. Maybe the Vice Lords. Or the Four Corner Hustlers, just a couple of the street gangs prominent in the city\u2019s \u201cL-Town\u201d area. Then something strange happened: Nothing.  \u201cAbout 10 guys in the crowd noticed me and knew what I was doing,\u201d Johnson recalled. \u201cThey let me go through. \u2018Don\u2019t bother him,\u2019 guys were telling other guys. They knew I had an opportunity to do something. And they didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Johnson got a pass that day. Enough of the hard cases in the crowd respected the dream he was chasing \u2014 from Westinghouse to the University of Illinois to the NBA, where he played 17 seasons and scored 19,202 points \u2014 that they cut him slack, same as they have for players before and in the four decades since. It\u2019s a sign of the reverence vast segments of the local population have for the sport, the high regard that bolsters a case made constantly by players and coaches with roots here. More than any other city in the nation, they contend Chicago is the \u201cMecca of basketball.\u201d With NBA All-Star 2020 descending on United Center (home of the Bulls) and Wintrust Arena (where DePaul University\u2019s teams and the WNBA\u2019s Chicago Sky play) this week, a familiar refrain that Chicago might be the center of basketball\u2019s universe packs some extra context and credibility. Not that certain proponents ever are shy about making the claim. \u201cIn Chicago, it means a lot more to us because we are a basketball city and we are the Mecca of basketball, and you can quote me on that,\u201d Lakers big man Anthony Davis said back in July. A product of the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side, Davis was back in town to work with a Nike youth camp for kids ages 8-17. He hadn\u2019t participated in anything like that in his grade school years, coming up the grittier Chicago way, indoors or (most of the time) out. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball in any condition, you know you gonna find a way to play,\u201d Davis told a gathering of reporters. \u201cNo matter if it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s freezing cold in the gym, outside it\u2019s raining, whatever. \u2026 By any means necessary, we wanna play the game.\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers, a high school All-American from just outside the city limits in Maywood, Ill., backed Davis\u2019 take entirely. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s right. It\u2019s not even a question,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThe Mecca of basketball is absolutely Chicago players. New York gets all the rub, which I don\u2019t get, but Chicago, it\u2019s not even close.\u201d The talent pipeline that delivered everyone from George Mikan and Cazzie Russell to Jabari Parker and Davis was pumping particularly well during Rivers\u2019 heyday. \u201cYou play against everybody,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI mean, how many kids can say, unless you grew up in Chicago, you can have a pickup game out in the park with Isiah Thomas, Terry Cummings, Maurice Cheeks, Mark Aguirre, Darrell Walker. There\u2019s not a lot of pickup games like that in your same grade. That\u2019s every year. That\u2019s called Chicago basketball.\u201d Look, this is highly subjective and largely recreational. Basketball fans across the country can argue for their towns as Meccas and no one is going to break the ties. New York? Of course. Los Angeles is the glamour market of the NBA, the site of so many players\u2019 offseason homes and training regimens. Boston, Philadelphia and Detroit can muster cases too. And if this version of the debate weren\u2019t so NBA-centric, Indiana and North Carolina might try to crash the party as state entries. But this is Chicago\u2019s time to shine. And to brag. \u201cLook at how many players we\u2019ve put in the league,\u201d said former NBA swingman Kendall Gill, raised just south of the city in Olympia Fields. \u201cIt\u2019s like we never stop sending guys to the league.\u201d With each one, the fraternity grows. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d Gill said. \u201cWhen Dwyane Wade was first in the league, I was at the end of my career. But when he saw me, he said \u2018Hey Chi-town.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up young fella?\u2019 The young players know about the guys before them, and it\u2019s always going to be repeated.\u201d The city has a hoops history that can offer compelling evidence for Mecca status. Consider: The Bulls weren\u2019t an instant hit with paying customers, but by their fourth season, they had assembled the nucleus of a contender that reached the conference semifinals or finals for five consecutive seasons. They won no titles, but the crew of Jerry Sloan, Norm Van Lier, Bob Love, Chet Walker and Tom Boerwinkle played some of the fiercest, most exciting games in franchise history. Until 1984 or thereabouts. \u201cTickets were very easy to come by,\u201d said Johnson, who was 12 when his mother moved the family from the Cabrini Green housing projects closer to Chicago Stadium. \u201cBob Love and Chet Walker were guys that I idolized growing up \u2014 Love was so smooth, and Walker with his 55 pump fakes.\u201d More than a decade earlier, Tony Allen had laid the foundation for his 14-year NBA career at Crane High in the Chicago Public League. He praised the summer leagues in the city for developing talent and whipping up excitement. \u201cMan, just to back up what AD said, we\u2019ve got an infamous Pro-Am league,\u201d Allen told NBA.com. \u201cIt was just some of the best ballplayers you could name that came through and played. Don\u2019t forget about our infamous documentary story, the Arthur Agee story [\u201cHoop Dreams\u201d documentary] \u2026 We were the first ones to put reality TV on the basketball side of things.\u201d Johnson, longtime broadcast analyst for the Phoenix Suns and a co-host on Sirius XM\u2019s NBA channel, also shared memories of summer basketball, dating back to the league at Malcolm X College. Then it was Chicago State, and later, as his pro career unfolded, Illinois Institute of Technology. \u201cI tell you, the gym was packed every night and you had the best of the best playing there,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEvery NBA player who was from Chicago would come back and play there. It kept us in shape, but it was a tremendous environment because it was packed.\u201d Especially from 1987 to 1989, when Michael Jordan came back to town and played \u2014 and notably in his final appearance. Shelly Stark, described by Johnson as a cornerstone of Chicago\u2019s summer-league offerings, was there the night Jordan locked horns with a young Tim Hardaway. Hardaway, another South Sider and son of Chicago playground \u201clegend\u201d Donald Hardaway, had wrapped up at Texas-El Paso and was headed to Golden State. \u201cBut on the South Side Tim was huge, and, man, you should have been there for that game,\u201d Stark told the Chicago Reader in 2003. \u201cWe had people coming in from all over, lining up outside the door, to see MJ and Hardaway free of charge.\u201d Stark said each player scored 45 points and Jordan\u2019s team won by two. Jordan\u2019s impact in growing basketball\u2019s popularity in Chicago is undeniable. The season before he was drafted, in a Bears and Cubs town, the Bulls drew an average of 6,365 fans. In Jordan\u2019s first two seasons, that bumped to about 11,600 per game, with about 7,000 unsold seats most nights in the cavernous Stadium. But by 1987-88, attendance had nearly tripled in four years to 18,061.  NBA commissioner Adam Silver was studying at the University of Chicago during Jordan\u2019s early years. \u201cPrior to that 1988 NBA All-Star game [at the Stadium],\u201d Silver recently told NBC Sports Chicago, \u201cI attended lots of games with my friends in law school. My recollection is it was not difficult to get tickets. Even for the great Michael Jordan, you could go to the ticket window before the game.\u201d In the 1990s, though, the Bulls broke through, winning six championships in eight seasons with Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Phil Jackson and the rest. Kids throughout the country wanted to \u201c Be Like Mike ,\u201d but nowhere more than in Chicago. \u201cMichael Jordan came up and put those championships in our city, and showed our own youth, man,\u201d said Allen, who was nine when the first 3-peat started and 16 when the second one ended. \u201cI remember running outside and everybody just going crazy. That motivated cats like myself and players all over the world.\u201d Still, Jordan was born in Brooklyn (he turns 57 on Feb. 17). His family soon moved to Wilmington, N.C. He doesn\u2019t qualify for any all-time, All-Chicago team . Neither, for that matter, does Love, Walker, Pippen or Dennis Rodman. Same with Kevin Garnett, who tore it up in his one year at Farragut Academy \u2014 the nation\u2019s No. 1 prospect, leading to a Hall of Fame-worthy NBA career \u2014 but spent his first 17 years in Mauldin, S.C.  No, the best to ever come from and represent Chicago have deeper roots. Like Aguirre, Cummings, Davis, Wade and Rose. And Thomas. \u201cIsiah, he took it to a new level,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe was a true prodigy. His ball handling, his persona, all as a young man. I played him 1-on-1 when he was in eighth grade and I was a junior, and he almost beat me. I had to be real physical with him to beat him.\u201d Thomas checked all the boxes of Chicago basketball bona fides. He was one of nine children, raised by his mother Mary on the West Side, not far from the asphalt court at Gladys Park. Money was tight, food was scarce. Mary Thomas became the stuff of legends and made-for-TV movies when she faced down, with a sawed-off shotgun, a group of Vice Lords who had come knocking to recruit her sons. Seeking better for her youngest son, she steered Thomas to the suburb of Westchester \u2014 a 90-minute commute each way by bus and train \u2014 to St. Joseph\u2019s High School. That\u2019s where he starred and earned a scholarship to Indiana, where he took coach Bob Knight and the Hoosiers to the NCAA title as a sophomore in 1981. Now imagine Rose getting drafted by the Pistons instead of the Bulls in 2008. That\u2019s essentially what happened with Thomas in 1981, when Detroit selected him second overall in the Draft, four spots ahead of Chicago. The most successful player in the city\u2019s history \u2014 12-time All-Star, two championships, Hall of Fame \u2014 wound up exiled to a rival, often feeling like a villain in his own town once Jordan moved in. \u201cWe all grew up Bulls fans,\u201d Thomas said several years ago. \u201cBut my mom and my brothers \u2026 sometimes I would look up in the stands and see them clapping for the Bulls, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018What the hell? I gave y\u2019all them tickets!\u2019 \u201cYour friends would tell you after you got them tickets, \u2018I\u2019m coming to the game, but you know we\u2019re gonna beat y\u2019all tonight.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m part of y\u2019all, right?\u2019 And they\u2019d say, \u2018No, we\u2019re with the Bulls.\u2019 It was nice to go home and just light it up because you knew after the game, if you lost, they were going to give it to you.\u201d Basketball took Thomas out of Chicago but nothing could take Chicago out of him. Some see his smile and on occasion wonder about his sincerity. But no one questions the authenticity of his trek from mean streets to posh boulevards across 50 years in the game. Chicago might be the Mecca, but if you grew up the way Thomas did, getting out was better than getting \u201cnext!\u201d \u201cWhat makes the journey special in Chicago,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cis navigating the games and navigating the peers that would try to get you to do something you didn\u2019t want to do. To get past that and be smart enough to not get caught up in anything.\u201d That applied to the city more than players raised in the less-risky suburbs of Chicagoland. But eventually, all hoops roads led to the same place. \u201cThere was never any prejudice in basketball in Chicago,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf you could play, you could play. We judged you on that. And how tough you were. \u201cCould you deal with a really intense situation? We\u2019d go into neighborhoods that weren\u2019t the best, guys would get physical with us, elbows get thrown to where you\u2019re going to have a fight. What do you do? Do you keep playing hard?\u201d In this town you do. Or you\u2019re done. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

As fertile as the area has been in sending talent to the NBA, as rich as the traditions have been in producing players who have become household names, the trick has been differentiating Chicago from \u201cChicagoland,\u201d and then determining who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out. If you stick with the strict boundaries of the Windy City as drawn by the politicians and bureaucrats (always potential trouble here) and go either by place of birth or high school, you cut out heavyweight candidates such as Dwyane Wade, Michael Finley, Doc Rivers and more who developed a few miles or even blocks outside the city\u2019s hardcore hoops scene. But if you open it up too far \u2014 to Illinois products such as Jack Sikma (Kankakee), Jerry Sloan (McLeansboro), Doug Collins (Benton) and Andre Iguodala (Springfield) \u2014 then you\u2019re no longer talking about Chicago. So you wind up defining the eligible area, and the candidates, by what\u2019s considered a manageable daily trek downtown, accepting no one who lived beyond the commuter railroad lines\u2019 last stops. Here then are my first, second and third teams of All-Chicago NBA players, based on growing up in the greater metro area \u2014 and thus, excluding even Bulls superstar Michael Jordan, forever a North Carolina guy. * * * Isiah Thomas  Born : Chicago High school : St. Joseph NBA stats : 19.2 ppg | 3.6 rpg | 9.3 apg, 1981-1994 Thomas arguably is one of the most underrated players in NBA history \u2014 he was an All-Star in 12 of his 13 seasons, with five All-NBA selections and two rings \u2014 but he generally is considered the best player ever from Chicago. Thomas went to high school about 14 miles from the impoverished West Side neighborhood where he grew up but that doesn\u2019t matter. He is fifth all-time in assists average and ranks near the top of unofficial NBA categories for inch-for-inch quality and toughness. Dwyane Wade  Born : Chicago High school : Richards NBA stats : 22.0 ppg | 4.7 rpg | 5.4 apg, 2003-2019 Wade technically grew up outside the city limits \u2014 in Robbins, Illinois \u2014 but nobody is challenging his status as a first-team Chicago elite. He was a 13-time All-Star and three-time champ who\u2019ll head to Springfield, Mass., as soon as he\u2019s eligible. Wade scored more points in the NBA (23,165) than anyone from his hometown and blocked more shots (885) than anyone his size (6-foot-4) or smaller in league history. Mark Aguirre  Born : Chicago High school : Westinghouse NBA stats : 20.0 ppg | 5.0 rpg | 3.1 apg, 1981-1994 \u201cThe Muffin Man\u201d triggered the resurgence of DePaul basketball and is revered by fellow members of the Chicago NBA alumni. Aguirre was a low-post, wide-bottom threat with Dallas, averaging 24.6 points with three All-Star appearances in eight seasons. But when buddy Thomas got the Pistons to acquire him in 1989, Aguirre adjusted his game (12.9 ppg in five seasons) but helped push Detroit over the top to NBA titles that spring and again in 1990. Terry Cummings  Born : Chicago High school : Carver NBA stats : 16.4 ppg | 7.3 rpg | 1.9 apg, 1982-2000 Cummings was a man among boys in college and even when he arrived in the NBA, beating out Hall of Famers James Worthy and Dominique Wilkins as 1983 Rookie of the Year. He was a two-time All-Star who went to the playoffs 13 times in 18 seasons, and he ranks third in points (19,460) and fifth in rebounds (8,630) among Chicago products. George Mikan  Born : Joliet High school : Quigley  NBA stats : 23.1 ppg | 13.4 rpg | 2.8 apg, 1948-1956 Mikan was the NBA\u2019s first superstar, a player whose size (6-foot-10, 245 pounds) put his name on marquees in the league\u2019s early years. He led the Minneapolis Lakers to five titles in seven seasons, and the only reason he didn\u2019t go 6-for-6 in All-Star berths is that the game didn\u2019t exist in Mikan\u2019s first two seasons. He might have won four or five MVPs but that honor wasn\u2019t created until Mikan\u2019s final season. * * * Derrick Rose  Born : Chicago High school : Simeon Career Academy NBA stats : 18.8 ppg | 3.4 rpg | 5.6 apg, 2008-Current Rose\u2019s career was broken for a while, but he remains the only Chicago product to be named NBA Most Valuable Player (2011). That traditionally is a ticket to the Hall of Fame, which Rose \u2014 who missed 318 of 624 games from 2012-2019 \u2014 seemed unlikely to achieve. But he has been a borderline All-Star and Kia Sixth Man candidate for Detroit this season, either of which would polish his resume.  Maurice Cheeks  Born : Chicago High school : Du Sable NBA stats : 11.1 ppg | 2.8 rpg | 6.7 apg, 1978-1993 It took Cheeks 21 years after he retired to reach the Hall of Fame, awfully long for a four-time All-Star, five-time All-Defensive pick and the floor general of Philadelphia\u2019s 1983 championship squad. Cheeks ranks 13th all-time in assists, fifth in steals and 60th in career FG percentage (.5234) \u2014 the top point guard on that list (Magic Johnson ranks 70th).  Michael Finley  Born : Melrose Park High school : Proviso East NBA stats : 15.7 ppg | 4.4 rpg | 2.9 apg, 1995-2010 Finley was definitely a \u201cChicagoland\u201d product, coming from Proviso East in Maywood \u2014 from which a dozen NBA players including Doc Rivers, Jim Brewer, Shannon Brown and Steven Hunter graduated. The two-time All-Star who spent nine seasons with Dallas won his ring in 2007 with San Antonio.  Antoine Walker  Born : Chicago High school : Mount Carmel NBA stats : 17.5 ppg | 7.7 rpg | 3.5 apg, 1996-2008 Walker\u2019s production, while good, never reached its potential, just as his Celtics only reached .500 twice in his first seven seasons. He often wasn\u2019t in great shape and was done at 31, but he earned a late ring with Miami in 2006. Anthony Davis  Born : Chicago High school : Perspectives Charter School NBA stats : 24.0 ppg | 10.4 rpg | 2.2 apg, 2012-Current With Rose as one of two active players here, Davis has done enough to merit this spot. He\u2019s a seven-time All-Star, assumed to be a future MVP, a monster in efficiency ratings and already 59th in blocks (a stat not tracked until 1973-74). Still ringless, though, with one series victory in two trips to the playoffs. * * *  Tim Hardaway  Born : Chicago High school : Carver NBA stats : 17.7 ppg | 3.3 rpg | 8.2 apg, 1989-2003 Only Thomas and Cheeks passed for more assists among the Chicago guys than Hardaway (7,095). A five-time All-NBA choice who missed a full season in his prime to injury (1993-94), he was part of Golden State\u2019s exciting \u201cRun TMC\u201d crew in the 90s with Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin. Seventeen years after he retired, his 1,542 3-pointers still lead all Chicagoans.  Jeff Hornacek  Born : Elmhurst High school : Lyons Township NBA stats : 14.5 ppg | 3.4 rpg | 4.9 apg, 1986-2000 Notes : Hornacek hails from the second ring of Chicago suburbs and is remembered most as shooting guard on Utah\u2019s Karl Malone-John Stockton teams that reached the Finals in 1997 and 1998. He was an All-Star with Phoenix in 1992. And he happens to be the only alumnus of his massive high school in LaGrange \u2014 to the chagrin of this writer, a fellow alum \u2014 to reach the NBA.  Juwan Howard  Born : Chicago High school : Chicago Vocational Career Academy NBA stats : 13.4 ppg | 6.1 rpg | 2.2 apg, 1994-2013 Nineteen seasons, eight teams and Top 10 spots in scoring, rebounds and minutes among the Chicago players. A one-time All-Star and one-time champion (2012 with Miami), Howard\u2019s greatest fame probably was as one of the \u201cFab Five\u201d freshmen recruits at Michigan in 1991.  Eddie Johnson  Born : Chicago High school : Westinghouse NBA stats : 16.0 ppg | 4.0 rpg | 2.1 apg, 1981-1999 Johnson, who teamed with Aguirre at Westinghouse and followed him into the NBA 28 picks apart in the 1981 Draft, played for six franchises across 17 seasons (with one year in Greece). No rings, never an All-Star, but he was the league\u2019s Sixth Man winner in 1989.  Dan Issel  Born : Batavia High school : Batavia NBA stats : 22.6 ppg | 9.1 rpg | 2.4 apg, 1970-1985 The \u201cyeah but\u201d responses to Issel come down to two things: Batavia is 40 miles west of United Center, far from Chicago\u2019s mean streets. But it is a suburb as \u201cChicagoland\u201d continues its sprawl north, south and west. The other objection is Issel spent six of his 15 pro seasons in the ABA. But he dominated that league, was a workhorse for Denver once the Nuggets entered the NBA in 1976-77 and by far is the points leader (27,482) among Chicago products. If you stripped out his ABA tenure, he\u2019d still rank 14th in points in nine pure NBA seasons on a Chicago list where everybody above him played at least 12. Tony Allen, Nick Anderson, Quinn Buckner, Dave Corzine, Kendall Gill, Rickey Green, Hersey Hawkins, Johnny (Red) Kerr, Corey Maggette, Jahlil Okafor, Kevin Porter, Quentin Richardson, Cazzie Russell, Glenn (Doc) Rivers, Darrell Walker, Patrick Beverley. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

James \u2014 a two-time gold medalist and three-time Olympian \u2014 is among 44 players announced by USA Basketball on Monday as finalists for the team that will play in the Tokyo Games this summer. James played in 2004, 2008 and 2012, helping the U.S. win gold in his most recent two appearances. The pool includes 19 players who have won a total of 31 gold medals in either Olympic or World Cup competition for the Americans \u2014 including nine players who captured the Olympic title for USA Basketball in Rio de Janeiro four years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve always maintained that equity is important,\u201d USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo told The Associated Press . \u201cAnd you earn equity by participating. So, we think they\u2019ve earned the right to be named to the overall roster for USA Basketball. It\u2019s pretty elite. It\u2019s a tremendous pot and the good news is they\u2019ve all said they want to play.\u201d James has played in 68 games for the U.S. national team and has said several times over the past year or so that he is thinking about another Olympics \u2014 after sitting out the Rio Games for a variety of reasons. Part of the interest in participating this summer is to have the chance to play for U.S. coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d James said in December. There will be no tryouts. USA Basketball will pare the list down to a 12-person Olympic team by early June, those decisions to be made by a selection committee \u2014 and to be based in part on player availability and health. Training camp will start in early July, potentially as little as two weeks after the end of the NBA Finals. The Olympics start July 24. USA Basketball officials, including Colangelo and Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, have met with players in a variety of ways over the past several weeks. Some talks have been directly with players, some with their agents, some with their NBA clubs, sometimes a combination thereof \u2014 and, Colangelo noted, there were some instances where players reached out directly to express interest. If they\u2019re on the list, that means USA Basketball is convinced they want to play. \u201cI feel very good about the response,\u201d Colangelo said. Also included in the pool: 15 of the 16 players from the U.S. who are scheduled to play in Sunday\u2019s NBA All-Star Game, and all 12 members of the team that represented the U.S. at last summer\u2019s Basketball World Cup in China \u2014 where the Americans managed only a seventh-place finish after roughly three dozen players who were on the list at some point dropped out along the way. The nine players still in the mix from the 2016 Olympic team: Sacramento\u2019s Harrison Barnes, Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler, San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan, Brooklyn\u2019s Kevin Durant, the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Paul George, Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green, Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving, Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry and Golden State\u2019s Klay Thompson. Back from the 2012 Olympic champion roster: the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis, Durant, Houston\u2019s James Harden, the Lakers\u2019 James, Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love, Oklahoma City\u2019s Chris Paul and Houston\u2019s Russell Westbrook. Back from the 2008 gold-medal squad: the Lakers\u2019 Dwight Howard. And those with World Cup or world championship gold medals for USA Basketball, but no Olympic gold to this point: Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry, Cleveland\u2019s Andre Drummond and Denver\u2019s Mason Plumlee. James and Paul won Olympic gold at Beijing in 2008, and James was part of the team that won bronze at Athens in 2004. If James joins this team, he will become the second four-time men\u2019s basketball Olympian for the U.S. \u2014 joining Carmelo Anthony. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to coaching the U.S. Olympic Team, and I\u2019m excited about the potential and possibilities this team has,\u201d Popovich said. The Olympics could be a return to the court for players like Durant and Thompson, who have missed the entirety of this NBA season with injuries. Durant\u2019s recovery from Achilles\u2019 surgery is at the point where he\u2019s doing some on-court work and Thompson has said he would like to play if his surgically repaired knee is up to the challenge. The 25 other players who are finalists for this summer\u2019s team but do not yet have Olympic or World Cup gold for the U.S.: Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo, San Antonio\u2019s LaMarcus Aldridge, Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal, Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker, Indiana\u2019s Malcolm Brogdon, Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown, Utah\u2019s Mike Conley, the Clippers\u2019 Montrezl Harrell, Brooklyn\u2019s Joe Harris, Philadelphia\u2019s Tobias Harris, Boston\u2019s Gordon Hayward, New Orleans\u2019 Brandon Ingram, the Lakers\u2019 Kyle Kuzma, the Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard, Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, Milwaukee\u2019s Brook Lopez, the Lakers\u2019 JaVale McGee, Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton, Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell, Indiana\u2019s Victor Oladipo, Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum, Indiana\u2019s Myles Turner, Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker and San Antonio\u2019s Derrick White. \u201cThe reason we have this big roster is a lot of things happen, a lot of variables,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s to say what\u2019s going to happen from an injury standpoint between now and June. We don\u2019t know. So we have the rest of the season to monitor, to watch. But when we select our 12, they will be 12 who are absolutely in with all fours.\u201d"},{"id":28817,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-cant-miss-matchups-walker-vs-westbrook","date":"2020-02-10","title":"5 Can't-Miss Matchups: Kemba Walker vs. Russell Westbrook","content":" With NBA All-Star 2020 approaching, this week\u2019s schedule features several compelling matchups, with most taking place on Monday and Tuesday. The clash between point guards from Team Giannis and Team LeBron headline this week\u2019s set of can\u2019t-miss matchups when Kemba Walker and Russell Westbrook square off Tuesday night in the second game of a double-header on TNT ( 9:30 ET ). * * * \u2022 Tuesday, Feb. 11 (9:30 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Nov. 23, 2018. The win-loss record in this matchup looks lopsided, but the majority all of the games between these two took place when Walker played for the struggling Charlotte Hornets. Now, Walker is leading a Boston squad with three legitimate All-Stars (Jaylen Brown was snubbed). Westbrook has come out on top in this matchup on three consecutive occasions, including the 30-point double-double he racked up the last time he faced Walker. In the two games they met in 2018, they matched up head to head for just under 3:30. But in this one, the two All-Stars could see more one-on-one time considering the makeup of their teams. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Tuesday, Feb. 11 (7 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Feb. 3, 2019.  Leonard faces Harris and the squad he knocked out of the playoffs in 2019 coming off scoring a season-high 43 points without Paul George in the lineup on L.A.\u2019s current four-game road trip going into the All-Star break. The 76ers, meanwhile, are an NBA-best 24-2 at home and have won nine straight at home. Leonard has won three of his last four matchups against Harris, who shot 27.8% in the last meeting between the players while committing three turnovers. Harris has put up 20 points or more in each of his last two outings. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, Feb. 10 (7:30 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Apr. 3, 2019. Karl Anthony-Towns got his wish when Minnesota traded for Russell on Thursday at the NBA\u2019s trade deadline. A right quadriceps contusion prevented Russell from making his debut on Saturday, but there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll play his first game with the Timberwolves against Lowry and the Raptors. Lowry is 8-1 in matchups against Russell and has won three consecutive games in this series. In the last two meetings between these players, Russell committed seven turnovers compared to none for Lowry. Two of those Russell turnovers came with Lowry guarding him. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, Feb. 10 (10:30 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Mar. 30, 2019.  Wiggins got off to a fast start with his new team, scoring 24 points on 8-of-12 shooting in his Warriors debut on Saturday. He\u2019ll have his work cut out for him against Butler, who has come out victorious in the last two games between these players, including a 13-point double-double in the last matchup. Butler has missed two consecutive games due to a strained right shoulder, but he\u2019s with Miami on its current five-game Western road trip. A MRI on Butler\u2019s shoulder revealed no structural damage, but it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll be available for this matchup against a reinvigorated Wiggins . Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, Feb. 10 (7 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 21, 2018.  Although these players have met on nine occasions, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Dinwiddie started in just three of the matchups. With Oladipo returning from a lengthy injury, the team held him out to rest Saturday against New Orleans. But Oladipo is expected come back for this one. He\u2019s averaging 10.6 points since his return along with 2.6 rebounds and 1.4 rebounds in 23.8 minutes per game. Oladipo has won seven-straight against Dinwiddie, who turned over the ball five times in the last meeting between the players while shooting 4 of 12 .

Red-hot Raptors aim for 15 straight Earlier this season, the Milwaukee Bucks put the NBA world on notice by ringing up 18 straight wins in roughly a month\u2019s time. These days, the Toronto Raptors are trying to do likewise as they seek their 15th straight win tonight vs. Minnesota ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). As with any great team, defense has been key for Toronto \u2014 especially during the win streak. Since Jan. 15, the Raptors are No. 1 in steals (10.5 per game), No. 2 in deflections (19.9 per game), No. 5 in charges drawn (12) and No. 5 in total contested shots . Minnesota will have its work cut out for it, then, as it ranks 21st in turnovers and No. 5 in turnover frequency percentage . 2. Can Jazz win another close one? Just when it looked like Utah was slumping, it has gotten its act together. A controversial three-point win on Friday vs. Portland was followed up with a thrilling one-point win Sunday (thanks to Bojan Bogdanovic\u2019s 3-pointer at the horn ). Lest you think those wins are pure luck, consider that the Jazz are 6-4 in games decided by three points or less this season. The Mavs host the Jazz ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) and while Luka Doncic remains out, Kristaps Porzingis has been hot during Doncic\u2019s absence (he\u2019s averaging 29 ppg, 11.3 rpg and 1.8 spg since Jan. 31). Porzingis struggled in Dallas\u2019 last game vs. Utah (which, of course, was another close win for the Jazz ) and will no doubt be looking to both bounce back from that showing and keep his hot streak rolling. 3. Bucks dominating sub-.500 teams Milwaukee is setting the standard this season when it comes to a winning team playing one that is its opposite. To date, Milwaukee is an impressive 33-1 against teams under .500 while also taking care of business against winning teams (going 12-6 in those games). The Kings visit the Bucks next ( 8 ET, NBA TV ) and will to not get steamrolled by Milwaukee\u2019s machine-like play. It won\u2019t be easy though \u2026 the Bucks are fresh off their 13th victory of the season without trailing and their 30th double-digit win. They\u2019re also outscoring opponents by 12.5 ppg, which is on pace for the highest point differential in NBA history. 4. Rodeo road trip woes for Spurs In the days leading up to San Antonio\u2019s annual road journey, the team was fresh off solid wins against the Jazz and Hornets. Since then, though, it has been mostly a disaster. The Spurs are 0-4 on the trek, losing two of those game by 20 points or more. A visit to Denver ( 9 ET, League Pass ) would not seem to help things as the Nuggets are 8-3 in their last 11 games. Aside from that, All-Star center Nikola Jokic is rolling : he\u2019s averaging 24.8 ppg, 10.9 rpg and 7.0 apg on 53.7% shooting since Jan. 2. 5. Suns\u2019 Booker in a slump When the All-Star reserves were announced on Jan. 30 , Suns guard Devin Booker was somewhat vocal about being excluded from that group. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how being left off has affected Booker, but the numbers show a dip in scoring production. From the start of the season until Jan. 30, Booker was averaging 27.1 ppg on 51% shooting (36.8% on 3-pointers), 4.1 rpg and 6.4 apg and the Suns were 20-27. Since Jan. 30 , Booker is at 24.3 ppg (45.4% overall; 36.1% on 3-pointers), 5.0 rpg and 5.7 apg and the Suns are 1-5. Maybe tonight\u2019s matchup against the Lakers ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) and their All-Star duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis will get Booker refocused. 6. On this date: Pierce immortalized Every generation of Celtics fans seems to have its iconic player and for those fans from the 2000s, that player was Paul Pierce. On Feb. 10, 2018, Boston officially retired Pierce\u2019s No. 34 jersey after the Cavaliers-Celtics game at TD Garden. Pierce became the 21st Celtics player to have his jersey retired, joining legends such as Larry Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale, Bill Russell, John Havlicek and others."},{"id":28785,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-bojan-bogdanovic-beats-rockets","date":"2020-02-10","title":"Horry Scale: Bojan Bogdanovic's deep 3-pointer stuns Rockets","content":" A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation \u2014 was the team tied or behind at the time? \u2014 along with importance \u2014 playoff game or garden-variety night in November? \u2014 and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. In a matchup of two teams jockeying for position in the middle of the Western Conference, the Jazz and Rockets traded punches down the stretch in Houston, but it was Bojan Bogdanovic who delivered the wild knockout blow. After P.J. Tucker hit a corner 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left, it appeared the Rockets had salvaged the win after fighting back down the stretch. But Jazz coach Quin Snyder drew up a perfect out-of-bounds play, and Bogdanovic came off the curl to hit a miraculous 29-footer at the buzzer to give Utah the 114-113 win at the Toyota Center. Through three quarters, though, Bogdanovic would have seemed like an unlikely hero. Bogdanovic, who averages 21.2 points, was struggling through one of the worst scoring games of the season, scoring two points through the first three quarters. Bogdanovic saved his best for last, though, and finished with eight, none bigger than the 3 that earned him his entry on the Horry Scale. \u201cBogie has been big for us all year,\u201d Mike Conley told NBA TV afterward. \u201cEveryone had the confidence in him to get the ball to him. He\u2019s a big-time player and that\u2019s just a fun win to be a part of.\u201d DIFFICULTY: The game-winner couldn\u2019t have been more difficult. Not only did he have two defenders draped all over him, but Bogdanovic may have even been fouled on the play. After setting a pindown screen for Donovan Mitchell (whom the Rockets defended well), Bogdanovic raced to the top of the 3-point circle, caught the inbound pass from Joe Ingles and barely had time to set his feet before launching an off-balanced shot over the outstretched arm of James Harden. The shot was dead on, and didn\u2019t touch rim as it silenced the crowd in Houston. \u201dThe play was designed for me to shoot a 3,\u201d Bogdanovic said. \u201dIt\u2019s big-time from their part to have that trust and confidence in me to make that shot after the game that I had.\u201d GAME SITUATION: The Rockets and Jazz had exchanged punches down the stretch of a back-and-forth thriller. Robert Covington had given Houston the lead with 28 seconds left, but moments later Donovan Mitchell hit a pair of free throws to give Utah a 111-110 lead. The Rockets seemed set to end a two-game losing streak when P.J. Tucker hit a clutch 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left. But the Rockets left too much time on the clock, and Utah\u2019s coaching staff believed in Bogdanovic, despite his struggles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to be on the court, the way I played all game,\u201d Bogdanovic said in his on-court interview. \u201cBut the coaching staff believed in me. I stayed confident. I know I\u2019m able to hit those shots.\u201d CELEBRATION: This isn\u2019t Bogdanovic\u2019s first buzzer-beater this season, but the celebration still seemed appropriate and spontaneous. After the bucket dropped, Bogdanovic turned and stared toward the other end of the floor as his Jazz teammates raced toward him. Bogdanovic was able to avoid their initial onrush, untucked his jersey and jumped up and down before being mobbed near the scorer\u2019s table. The best part of the celebration, though, may have been the reaction from the other team, as P.J. Tucker slumped to the ground, appearing to cover his mouth in awe as if to chuckle in amazement at the dagger. \u201dI knew it was good as soon as he caught it,\u201d Tucker said. \u201dHe got a good lift on it. I could tell as soon as he shot it.\u201d GRADE: This Horry Scale entry had it all: Two Western Conference teams trying to figure things out, fighting for playoff positioning. A beautifully drawn up play, designed for a player who struggled the entire game. Near-perfect defense with two players guarding the shooter as tightly as possible. A perfect splash, followed by an emotional celebration by the road team. When asked after the game how Bogdanovic would rate his game-winner, the sixth-year forward said, \u201cBetter than the Milwaukee one.\u201d Well, who are we to argue with Bogie? We graded that night\u2019s corner 3-pointer with \u201c4 Horrys\u201d \u2026 so this one gets a bump. 4.5 Horrys .

The Jan. 26 crash occurred in cloudy conditions and aviation experts said the \u201cinvestigative update\u201d from the National Transportation Safety Board reinforces the notion the pilot became disoriented and crashed while trying to get to clear skies around Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles. The veteran pilot, Ara Zobayan, came agonizingly close to finding his way out of the clouds. He told air traffic control he was climbing to 4,000 feet (1,219 meters). He ascended to 2,300 feet (701 meters), just 100 feet (30 meters) from what camera footage later reviewed by the NTSB showed was the top of the clouds. But rather than continuing higher Zobayan began a high-speed descent and left turn in rapidly rising terrain. He slammed into the hillside at more than 180 mph (290 kph) and was descending at 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) per minute. \u201c\u201cIf you exit the bottom of the clouds at 4000 feet per minute at that high speed, you\u2019ve certainly lost control of the aircraft,\u201d air safety consultant Kipp Lau said. He said Bryant\u2019s chopper could have emerged from the clouds in just 12 more seconds, assuming it was ascending at 500 feet (152.40 meters) per minute. \u201cOnce you break out of the clouds it\u2019s clear. Everything lines up with the body,\u201d Lau said. \u201cNow you have a real horizon.\u201d Mike Sagely, a helicopter pilot in the Los Angeles area with 35 years of flying experience, said the aircraft\u2019s last moments suggest Zobayan had started to execute a maneuver designed to pop above the clouds by flying up and forward. \u201cWhen he went into the clouds, he had a full on emergency,\u201d Sagely said. When pilots try to turn instead of sticking with the pop-up maneuver, \u201cprobably in the neighborhood of 80 to 90% of the time, it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. The crash occurred as the group was flying to a girls basketball tournament at Bryant\u2019s Mamba Sports Academy. He coached his 13-year-old daughter Gianna\u2019s team. She and two teammates were among the nine people killed. The deaths shook Los Angeles and the sporting world. Within hours, thousands had gathered outside Staples Center, where Bryant starred for the Lakers, and began a makeshift memorial that became a massive display of flowers, candles, personal notes, basketballs and other mementos. A public memorial is scheduled for Feb. 24 at Staples. The date 2\/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by Gianna. The NTSB\u2019s report was a compilation of information and data about the flight, helicopter and pilot. It\u2019s likely to take a year for the NTSB to issue a report about the cause. Zobayan was a regular pilot for Bryant and the chief pilot for Island Express Helicopters, with more than 8,200 hours of flight time. He was certified to fly solely using instruments \u2013 a more difficult rating to attain that allows pilots to fly at night and through clouds when the ground isn\u2019t visible \u2013 and was a pilot to other celebrities including LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard and Kylie Jenner. During the flight with Bryant\u2019s group, Zobayan did not report any equipment problems and sounded calm while communicating to air traffic controllers. His final transmission said he was going to climb above the clouds. Eight seconds after reaching peak altitude, he started the fateful descent. An unidentified witness told the NTSB the hillside where the crash occurred was shrouded in mist when he heard the helicopter approaching. It sounded normal and he then saw the blue-and-white aircraft emerge from the fog moving forward and down. Within 2 seconds it slammed into the hillside just below him. Former Island Express pilot Kurt Deetz, who regularly flew Bryant to games at the Staples Center, said reading the NTSB\u2019s report reinforced how dangerously fast the helicopter was traveling in conditions that had prompted the Los Angeles Police Department and the county sheriff to ground their copters. \u201cNormally in those conditions, you\u2019re pretty cautious. You\u2019re proceeding slowly,\u201d Deetz said. The impact tore the helicopter apart and all aboard died from blunt force trauma. The aircraft\u2019s instrument panel was destroyed and most of the devices were displaced. The flight controls were broken and suffered fire damage. Investigators believe that since a tree branch at the crash site was cut, the engines were working and rotors turning at the time of impact. All four of the helicopter\u2019s blades had similar damage, the report stated. The 50-year-old Zobayan\u2019s most recent flight review included training on inadvertently flying into bad weather conditions. It covered how to recover if the aircraft\u2019s nose is pointed too far up or down, and what to do if the helicopter banks severely to one side. He earned satisfactory grades in the review, which took place in May 2019. Deetz said Zobayan previously had told him that he did not have actual experience flying in clouds, despite being certified. Deetz said that isn\u2019t uncommon. Bryant\u2019s helicopter did not have a device called the Terrain Awareness and Warning System, known as TAWS, that signals when an aircraft is in danger of hitting ground. The NTSB has recommended the system be mandatory for helicopters but the Federal Aviation Administration only requires it for air ambulances. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Brad Sherman, both California Democrats, have called for the FAA to mandate the devices. While NTSB Member Jennifer Homendy has said it\u2019s not clear if the warning system would have averted the crash, aviation expert Gary Robb said Friday\u2019s report highlights the need to equip all helicopters with the warning system. \u201cIf this helicopter had had TAWS, Mr. Bryant and the rest of the passengers would be alive today,\u201d said Robb, a lawyer who has written a textbook about helicopter crash litigation. The others killed included Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri and daughter Alyssa; Bryant\u2019s friend and assistant coach, Christina Mauser; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton, 14. A public memorial for the Altobelli family will be held Monday at Angel Stadium in Anaheim."},{"id":28780,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kobe-bryant-memorial-set-february-24-report","date":"2020-02-08","title":"Kobe Bryant memorial set for Feb. 24 at Staples Center","content":"A public memorial service for Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna is planned for Feb. 24 at Staples Center.

With a high pick-and-roll on the way, Lillard burst between his screener and his defender, leaving Rudy Gobert trailing and only Royce O\u2019Neale between the Blazers and a tie. And then came Gobert, who blocked the shot against the backboard \u2014 after it had already kissed the glass. No call, no comeback. Lillard, enraged over the lack of a foul or goaltending call by the officials, needed to be restrained as he exited the court. \u201dWe get to the last play of the game and they miss a easy call,\u201d Lillard said. \u201dThen they tell us it\u2019s a easy no call, like that\u2019s obviously not a goaltend. It cost us the (expletive) game, man.\u201d NBA referee Josh Tiven confirmed to a pool reporter after the game that video review showed that a goaltending violation should have been called originally, but it was not a reviewable play because the crew did not call it on the floor. That was little consolation for the Trail Blazers.

Golden State dealt D\u2019Angelo Russell, Jacob Evans III and Omari Spellman to the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of Thursday\u2019s trade deadline for Andrew Wiggins and draft picks \u2014 Minneosta\u2019s first-rounder and second-rounder in 2021, unless the first-rounder is in the top three and then it would roll over to 2022. It was \u201csomber\u201d as Myers put it after Golden State opted to send so many players packing for new opportunities. He felt it. Coaches felt it. The young Warriors said heartfelt farewells, having built tight bonds by being thrown into the fire because of injuries to stars such as Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and following Kevin Durant\u2019s offseason departure to the Nets. Myers appreciates how this group competed and cared so much despite a 12-40 record that ranks last in the league for a franchise that reached the past five NBA Finals during a remarkable run that included championships in 2015, \u201917 and \u201918. \u201cI hope our environment makes me better, makes players better. We were talking about the difficulty of trading those guys the other night in Brooklyn and somebody mentioned to me, \u2018This is really rough on our culture,\u2019 and I said, \u2018You know what\u2019s amazing, we have the worst record in the NBA, not one player wanted to go.\u2019 That\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d Myers said, applauding coach Steve Kerr\u2019s role and the support of owner Joe Lacob. \u201cI promise you there\u2019s a lot of good players on a lot of good teams that don\u2019t want to be there, so that says something about what Steve has built with his staff, what Joe\u2019s done with what he\u2019s provided for the players but you just don\u2019t see that. I promise you as an agent, trade deadline I had guys on really good teams saying \u2018I don\u2019t want to be here.\u2019 \u2026 If our environment can\u2019t make people better then we\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201d Now, Golden State will go forward looking to the future with an ability to spend big come free agency this summer. Even with all the change, Myers still expects that \u201cwe\u2019re still going to spend a lot.\u201d \u201cAs painful as it was to move some of these guys and do that, the thinking was that going into 2020 summer it provided some flexibility and maneuverability with our payroll,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 But there are degrees where you have to be responsible and just say, \u2019Listen, we can do this, it\u2019s going to be a short-term pain but maybe an ability to provide more optionality going forward.\u201d To help fill out the roster Friday, Golden State signed Ky Bowman and Marquese Chriss after they had previously been two-way players splitting with the G-League Warriors. Juan Toscano-Anderson was promoted from the G League club. \u201cSometimes you just do what you do in the moment and you live with whatever comes after it,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIf it works, great, you get applauded. And if not, you get criticized, and that\u2019s the job.\u201d Myers took a moment Friday and pondered just how fast things change in professional sports. \u201cI was walking over here thinking last year we had the best record in the NBA, now we have the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 24 months. And our roster has lost Durant. It\u2019s just crazy.\u201d"},{"id":28831,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-reggie-jackson-buyout-darren-collison-return","date":"2020-02-08","title":"Reports: Reggie Jackson considering buyout, Darren Collison weighs return","content":" Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson might be joining the post-deadline buyout market, according to a report from Marc Stein of The New York Times .

In a three-team trade that was official on Feb. 6, the Heat acquired Iguodala from the Grizzlies and reportedly inked him to a two-year, $30 million extension.

On Tuesday night, in his first showdown with Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, Williamson scored 20 points , but was just 5-for-19 from the field in one of his worst shooting nights of his young career. \u201dWe put a lot of guys, a lot of different looks to him,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201dJust tried to make him guess, just tried to make it tough as possible. You know he\u2019s going to try to go left, try to overpower whoever\u2019s guarding him, try to go finish strong, and guys behind have got to be active.\u201d Williamson, who missed all 3-point attempts, admitted he became flustered by the defense the East-leading Bucks threw at him. \u201dIt was very physical,\u201d Williamson said. \u201dIt was one of those nights where I couldn\u2019t get my second-jump layup to fall. It was very frustrating, but my teammates were in my ear, telling me to keep going.\u201d Antetokounmpo left impressed by the No. 1 pick, though. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a really good player for a lot of years to come,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe\u2019s out there helping the team; he\u2019s competing as hard as possible. He\u2019s just gotta stay healthy, and he\u2019s gonna have a bright future.\u201d Two nights later, Williamson proved he can learn from his off nights.  Playing in the house Michael Jordan built (Zion admitted he was in awe seeing the banners in the rafters), Williamson took all 11 shots within three feet of the rim, hitting nine, to finish with 21 points in the Pelicans\u2019 125-119 win over the Bulls.  Williamson was dominant in the paint, scoring on a variety of backdowns and post-up moves, capping off his night with a thunderous alley-oop in the win that wasn\u2019t as close as the final score would indicate. While the Bulls\u2019 defense isn\u2019t as stout as the Bucks\u2019, Williamson\u2019s ability to adapt and take his game inside shows just why Giannis and everyone sees such a bright future in the No. 1 pick. * * *  Last week: No. 1 After a 121-107 win over Dallas on Wednesday, Morant has the Grizzlies above .500 for the first time this season and securely 8th in the West (2.5 games ahead of Portland). Morant scored 21 points on 10-for-12 shooting and lived up to the pregame hype from Dallas coach Rick Carlisle. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this kind of athleticism in a point guard since Westbrook when he came into the league,\u201d Carlisle said before the matchup. \u201cHe\u2019s got an exhilarating vibe when he steps on to a basketball court. \u2026 Dynamic is not even the word. He\u2019s beyond that.\u201d Last week: No. 3 Williamson was the best rookie scorer this week, averaging 21.7 points and he\u2019s now scored 20-plus in four straight games (the longest stretch by a rookie this season). While Williamson won\u2019t catch Morant unless the Grizzlies guard gets hit by injury, he\u2019s definitely establishing himself as the most game-changing rookie of this class. The Pelicans are currently 5.5 games out of 8th and likely won\u2019t be able to make up that much ground, but Williamson is sure to make things interesting after the All-Star break.  Last week: No. 5 Nunn has been a mainstay in the top 5 most of the season, but slipped to fifth last week after missing three games with a sore Achilles tendon. In three games since his return, though, he\u2019s slowly coming back into form, averaging 9.3 points while helping Miami win two of three. Nunn did take home some more hardware this week, too, earning his third straight Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for his play in January. Nunn finished the month averaging 16.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists while shooting 50.7% from the field. Nunn has a stranglehold on the honors, having received the honor for both November and December. Many of my readers squabbled with my dropping him to fifth (below Zion, which didn\u2019t sit well), but readers should remember extra weight is given for recent play, so a guy missing a full week is likely going to drop in the rankings.  Last week: No. 2 Porter Jr. has missed the Nuggets\u2019 last last three games after injuring his right ankle in Friday\u2019s 127-115 victory over the Bucks. It\u2019s too bad, too, because the No. 14 pick from 2018 was on a roll with back-to-back double-doubles. He\u2019s become a key piece to the Nuggets\u2019 rotation (the team made it clear he wasn\u2019t available at the trade deadline), having scored in double-digits in nine of his last 10 games, and coach Mike Malone doesn\u2019t expect the ankle sprain to be a long-term injury.  Last week: Not ranked The Cavs have a pair of guards showing out lately, but Garland gets the nod for the Top 5 this week. The No. 5 pick is finding his stroke, going 9-for-19 from beyond the arc in his last three games. More impressive, though, is his willingness to distribute the ball, averaging 5.8 assists in his last four games (while scoring 14.3 ppg), a number that might only improve with the addition of Andre Drummond, whom the Cavs landed from Detroit at the deadline. Just missed the cut: Terence Davis, Toronto Raptors Last 4 games (4-0 record): 11.8 ppg, 62.1% FG, 58.8% 3FG, Career-high 31 points (12-15 FG, 6-7 3FG) in Raptors\u2019 129-102 win over Bulls Kevin Porter Jr., Cleveland Cavaliers Last 4 games (0-4 record): 14.3 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 2.3 apg, 47.5% FG, 42.1% 3FG| Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Last 4 games (2-2 record): 12.5 ppg, 1.5 rpg, 44.4% FG, 50.0% 3FG DeAndre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks Last 2 games (2-0 record): 13.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 3.0 apg, 52.6% FG, 50% 3FG Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies Last 2 games (2-0 record): 11.0 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 1.0 bpg, 52.9% FG, missed 2 games with hip soreness * * * ( All stats through Thursday, Feb. 6 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

In addition, Miami has reportedly agreed to a two-year, $30 million extension with the 2015 NBA Finals MVP, the last year a team option. Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill will join Iguodala in Miami, while Memphis will acquire Justise Winslow, Dion Waiters and James Johnson. The Grizzlies have traded Johnson to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for forward Gorgui Dieng, in a deal first reported by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Waiters isn\u2019t expected to remain on the roster, per Chris Haynes . Miami\u2019s efforts to expand the trade and acquire Oklahoma City\u2019s Danilo Gallinari did not work. The Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers both reportedly tried to deal for Iguodala, but couldn\u2019t sway Memphis. The 36-year-old Iguodala hasn\u2019t played for the Grizzlies since being traded by the Warriors over the summer. With the team\u2019s approval, he\u2019s been on standby , apart from the rest of the roster until further notice. Iguodala played in 68 games for Golden State in 2018-19, averaging 5.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 23.2 minutes. Iguodala, speaking to The Undefeated , said he was eager to play alongside Jimmy Butler and Miami\u2019s young core \u2014 saying he looked forward to helping mentor them as well. \u201cJimmy Butler \u2026 he\u2019s looked at as different but (is) very well-respected in terms of the passion and the hard work that he brings to the game,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cI feel like his temperament and values that he has really resonates with the Miami Heat. They\u2019re very well aligned. I think he\u2019s brought out the best in those young guys.\u201d Iguodala specifically mentioned Heat center Bam Adebayo, a first-time All-Star this year. \u201cBam, I\u2019m really looking forward to playing with him,\u201d Iguodala said. If Winslow ends up in Memphis, the Grizzlies will be acquiring a player whose multipositional talent \u2014 notably running the point for long stretches \u2014 has been muted by extended spells on the injured list. The 23-year-old has appeared only 11 times this season due to a bone bruise in his back and also a concussion, and hasn\u2019t played more than 68 games since his rookie year (2015-16). Last season, Winslow averaged 12.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.1 steals in 29.3 minutes, shooting a career-high 43.3% from the floor, including 37.5% on 3s. Winslow indicated in a tweet that he was part of the deal, reaching out to fellow former Duke players Tyus Jones and Grayson Allen with a message. Jones and Allen are both members of the Grizzlies. Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks, who said earlier this week that he was looking forward to playing against Iguodala one day \u201cand show him really what Memphis is about,\u201d said he was eager to play with Winslow. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a good player,\u201d Brooks said . \u201cNow we have a player that we\u2019re getting that actually wants to play with us and thinks we\u2019re good. We can keep the ball rolling.\u201d Teammate Ja Morant, who amplified Brooks\u2019 sentiment about Iguodala on social media, told reporters : \u201cIt\u2019s over with, and we\u2019re looking to play with the players that are on the floor. We\u2019re handling business.\u201d More players and picks are expected to move before the deal is made official. Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill were both held out of Memphis\u2019 win over Dallas because they were likely to be involved in the pending trade. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins, without commenting specifically on the still-not-completed transaction, said Crowder and Hill \u201creally helped build something great here in Memphis. The Heat went into the trade deadline prioritizing perimeter defensive help, which made Iguodala a perfect fit. It was not immediately clear when he would join the Heat, which was starting a five-game trip in Los Angeles against the Clippers on Wednesday. \u201c We\u2019re ready to go to war ,\u201d said Heat star Jimmy Butler. \u201cWe know we can compete with the best of them. \u201c He\u2019s super smart. There\u2019s nothing he cannot do. When I get to learn from him, when everyone gets to learn from him, that winning level, that meter, is going up in everyone\u2019s mind.\u201d Holding the team option for 2021-22 is a critical component for Miami, which intends to have maximum flexibility for free-agent shopping in the summer of 2021 and made clear to all teams in recent days \u2014 and even last summer \u2014 that it would not compromise those plans. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra declined to discuss the deal when speaking with reporters in Los Angeles. Miami would be the fourth team that Iguodala has suited up for \u2014 joining Philadelphia, Denver and Golden State. He has averaged 12.1 points in 1,108 career games, plus is a veteran of 145 playoff contests and was with the Warriors for all five of their NBA Finals runs over the last half-decade. He\u2019s a three-time champion and two-time All-Defensive team member, and getting him is a clear sign that the Heat are expecting to be a postseason contender. \u201cExcited to get back out there,\u201d Iguodala said.

The Timberwolves will also receive Jacob Evans and Omari Spellman, the teams announced on Thursday. Russell, whom Golden State acquired via sign-and-trade with Brooklyn last offseason, is averaging a career-high 23.6 points along with 6.2 assists and 3.7 rebounds. This marks Russell\u2019s fourth team since being drafted second overall in 2015. An All-Star last season with the Nets, Russell now joins good friend Karl-Anthony Towns on the Timberwolves, giving the franchise a young guard-center duo locked into long-term contracts. Wiggins, meanwhile, will look for a fresh start in San Francisco after failing to live up to the hype of being drafted first overall in 2014. The 24-year-old forward is in the second year of a five-year max contract, averaging 22.4 ppg, 5.2 rpg and 3.7 apg. Golden State has been decimated by injuries to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. The Warriors sit in last place in the Western Conference \u2014 just four games behind the Wolves \u2014 but the prospect of their stars\u2019 respective returns and a potential top-four pick this summer could make for a quick turnaround. The Timberwolves, who have lost 12 straight games, have bottomed out in their first year under president of basketball operations Gersson Rosas as he attempts to remake the roster for a faster-paced, 3-point-heavy offense as directed by rookie coach Ryan Saunders. * * * From NBA.com\u2019s Michael C. Wright Main Takeaway: There\u2019s always the question of which team won a trade once it\u2019s consummated, and this transaction could prove to be a win-win for both parties. Impact on Warriors: There was always the question of how Russell would fit with Curry, because the former just isn\u2019t tailor-made for Golden State\u2019s style of play. While Russell is averaging a career-high 23.6 points per game, the Warriors needed a more natural fit, plus they\u2019re also trying to restock the cupboard for more runs at a championship; a goal aided somewhat by the picks they\u2019ll receive. By sending off the Evans and Spellman contracts, Golden State also puts itself in position to avoid the luxury tax, which also would take them out of the repeater tax next season. The top overall pick in 2014, Wiggins has largely been disappointing over his first six seasons. But he\u2019s just 24 years old, and Golden State has the developmental personnel, coaching staff and veteran leadership in the locker room to resurrect Wiggins\u2019 career as a potential starting wing for a revamped Warriors roster. Impact on Timberwolves: The free-falling Timberwolves, with two double-digit losing streaks since the start of December \u2014 needed a young, dynamic threat to pair alongside Towns, and that\u2019s exactly what they receive in this deal for Russell, who is shooting 43% from the floor and 37.4% from deep, in addition to dishing 6.2 assists per game. The Timberwolves had long coveted Russell, and simultaneously were able to shed the contract of Wiggins, who never quite lived up to his promise. Besides that, Russell and Towns are good friends, which should help the pair mesh quickly. Towns had been pretty vocal lately about his disappointment in how Minnesota\u2019s season is going. But if you remember, Minnesota pursued Russell in free agency with Towns heading up the recruitment, before the Timberwolves ultimately lost him to the Warriors. Russell\u2019s ability to create and score dovetails with the style of play in Minnesota envisioned by Saunders and Rosas, while also keeping Towns happy."},{"id":28861,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-feb-7-edition","date":"2020-02-07","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Jayson Tatum getting comfortable in his All-Star skin","content":" Jayson Tatum is still getting used to hearing it.

All Tatum could do was shoot him a quick smile as he ran back into the relentless grind that has delivered the first of what could be many All-Star appearances . Tatum is in a different space compared to where he was a year ago, when he and Jaylen Brown struggled with the adjustments they had to make playing alongside Kyrie Irving. Brown and Tatum have both been spectacular at times with Kemba Walker now holding down Irving\u2019s old spot. Either one of Tatum or Brown could have been an All-Star and been worthy of the honor.

So it\u2019s just been about learning to navigate the danger and being a focal point that people use to scout our team.\u201d All the experience gained thus far, both good and bad, continue to pay off for Tatum and the Celtics. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cThe more years you play, the more games you play you feel more comfortable out there. You just learn a lot by trial and error. But in the end everybody just has to go out and do their job, whatever it is, and we\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s really simple for us right now.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  30.8 points, 13.4 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.1 steals, 1.0 blocks Giannis was at his freaky best Thursday night as the Bucks disposed of Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers behind his 36 points, 20 rebounds and six assists . It was a full day and night of work for the Bucks\u2019 superstar, who spent part of his day drafting the All-Stars who will comprise Team Giannis at next week\u2019s 69th All-Star Game in Chicago . Last week: No. 2 Season stats:  25.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, 10.8 assists, 1.3 steals LeBron and the Lakers couldn\u2019t solve Houston\u2019s new ultra-small ball lineup in Thursday\u2019s loss at Staples Center. The Lakers also didn\u2019t execute any trades by Thursday\u2019s deadline, meaning they\u2019ll have to do any tinkering with the roster in the buyout market. Los Angeles native Darren Collison being spotted in the crowd might be more than just a coincidence. Last week: No. 3 Season stats: 27.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.9 steals Leonard must feel good about all of the work the Clippers got done at the trade deadline. Adding Marcus Morris gives them another rugged, two-way player capable of supplying quality minutes on those nights when Leonard is out of the lineup. Leonard\u2019s minutes when the full lineup is available will be managed accordingly with the new additions. Last week: No. 5 Season stats: 20.5 points, 6.8 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.8 steals Adding a three-time champion and Finals MVP in Andre Iguodala to the All-Star frontcourt pairing of Butler and Bam Adebayo at the trade deadline was an absolute masterstroke by the Heat front office. Butler will have a veteran to lean on if needed. But, more importantly, he has a new partner on the perimeter every bit as capable as he is of locking an opposing star down. Last week: No. 8 Season stats:  20.6 points, 10.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists, 1.2 steals Jokic is just the 10th player in NBA history to produce a 30-20-10 game , as he did in Wednesday\u2019s showdown win in Utah.

Pacers try (again) to cool off Raptors If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try to play that team again. While that\u2019s not exactly how the old adage goes, the Pacers are glad to have another crack at the Toronto Raptors ( 8 ET, ESPN ) after Indiana blew an 11-point lead with 3 minutes, 50 seconds to play on Wednesday. The Raptors won\u2019t be going away easy, though. Not with them sporting a franchise-record 12-game win streak and All-Star forward Pascal Siakam rolling during that stretch (21.3 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 3.2 apg, 1.3 spg during the win streak). 2. No Iguodala (or Butler) just yet, Miami The Miami Heat made one of the biggest trade splashes before Thursday\u2019s deadline, picking up Andre Iguodala from Memphis in a three-team trade. Unfortunately, neither he nor his All-Star teammate, Jimmy Butler, will suit up tonight in Sacramento ( 10 ET, League Pass ) as the Kings get their first look at their new additions ( Jabari Parker and Alex Len ), too. The Heat are expected to be at full strength Sunday against the Trail Blazers, but for tonight, All-Star Bam Adebayo and Co. will do a lot of the heavy lifting against the Kings. 3. A change in the middle for Detroit For the first time since Oct. 31, 2012, the Pistons will not have center Andre Drummond on the court. He was dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers yesterday as Detroit is fully starting a reset of itself for a new era. The initial look at what that might be comes tonight in Oklahoma City ( 8 ET, League Pass ) as youngsters like Sekou Doumbouya, Bruce Brown, Svi Mykhailiuk, Luke Kennard, Christian Wood and others will get more playing time in various roles. While Detroit is just 4 1\/2 games out of No. 8 in the East as of this writing, the rest of this season is about next season now. 4. New bigs land in Atlanta Clint Capela, welcome aboard . Dewayne Dedmon, welcome back . The Celtics will be the first foe to get a glimpse of the Hawks\u2019 revamped center rotation ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) and it should be interesting to see how All-Star guard Trae Young benefits from it. Departed center Alex Len received 8.5% of Young\u2019s passes and took 73.9% of his shots from less than 10 feet. In Houston, Capela received passes from Russell Westbrook 13.4% of the time and from James Harden 13.5% of the time . In either case, Capela finished his shots within 10 feet of the rim around 99.2% of the time . All that to say: watch for lots and lots of alley-oops and rim runs from Capela. 5. Will Sixers ever get on track? Philadelphia was fairly quiet at the trade deadline, adding two guards to its mix ( Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III ) while parting with a rotation player ( James Ennis ). The new faces didn\u2019t play in last night\u2019s blowout loss to the Bucks , which marked the Sixers fourth straight loss. \u201cInside The NBA\u201d analyst Charles Barkley called the Sixers \u201c the Cleveland Browns of the NBA \u201d after their loss and, it\u2019s hard to figure out exactly what\u2019s wrong in Philly . The good news for Philadelphia is it is back home tonight. The bad news is it is playing the surging Memphis Grizzlies ( 7 ET, League Pass ), who seem to be invigorated by their part in the Iguodala trade . 6. Skidding Jazz try to right ship Few teams are more of a current representation of how quickly things can change in the NBA than Utah. On Jan. 25, they scored a thrilling home win against the Dallas Mavericks, giving the Jazz 14 wins in their last 15 games. Since then? They\u2019ve lost five in a row (although only one of those was a blowout). Utah hosts the Blazers next ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) as part of a four-game, pre-All-Star break stretch that includes the Rockets (Feb. 9), Mavs (Feb. 10) and Heat (Feb. 12). A win tonight could get Utah headed in the right direction before the All-Star break."},{"id":28839,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2020-all-star-draft-results-official-release","date":"2020-02-07","title":"LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo draft team rosters for 2020 NBA All-Star Game","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Captains LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks have selected the team rosters for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, as revealed tonight in TNT\u2019s presentation of the NBA All-Star Draft. The Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis was selected by James with the first overall pick in the 2020 NBA All-Star Draft . The Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Joel Embiid was drafted by Antetokounmpo with the No. 2 overall pick. See below and attached for the complete pick-by-pick results and the team rosters for the NBA All-Star Game.  The 69th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 16 at the United Center in Chicago, airing live at 8 p.m. ET on TNT and ESPN Radio in the United States. NBA All-Star 2020 will reach fans in more than 200 countries and territories in nearly 50 languages on their televisions, computers, mobile phones and tablets.  James and Antetokounmpo drafted the NBA All-Star Game team rosters from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves in each conference. The two captains made 11 picks each \u2013 four starters and seven reserves \u2013 without regard to a player\u2019s conference affiliation or position.  During the NBA All-Star Draft, the eight remaining starters (aside from James and Antetokounmpo) were selected in the first round. The 14 reserves were chosen in the second round. James, the top overall finisher in fan voting, was awarded the first pick in the first round. Antetokounmpo made the first pick in the second round. The captains alternated picks in each round until all players in that round had been selected. Both NBA All-Star Game teams will play for a Chicago-based charity beneficiary, as selected by James and Antetokounmpo. Team LeBron will play for Chicago Scholars, a nonprofit leadership development organization that empowers academically ambitious students from under-resourced communities to complete college and become the next generation of leaders. Team Giannis will play for After School Matters, a nonprofit organization that provides life-changing after-school and summer program opportunities to nearly 19,000 Chicago teenagers each year. As part of the new format for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, the two teams will compete to win each quarter for their designated charities.  Click here for more information about the new format. Team Giannis will wear the red Jordan Brand NBA All-Star 2020 uniforms and Team LeBron will wear the blue Jordan Brand NBA All-Star 2020 uniforms. As previously announced, Team Giannis will wear No. 24 and Team LeBron will wear No. 2 \u2013 the basketball jersey numbers of the late Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna, respectively. Both teams will wear jersey patches displaying nine stars, representing Kobe, Gianna and their seven friends and teammates who tragically passed away in a helicopter accident on Jan. 26.  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, choosing a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Silver\u2019s selection would join the team that drafted the replaced player. If a replaced player is a starter, the head coach of that team would name a new starter from his team\u2019s group of reserves. Lakers head coach Frank Vogel will lead Team LeBron, and Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse will guide Team Giannis.

For years, the thinking around the NBA used to be, \u201cNo contract is bad if it can be traded.\u201d With Andrew Wiggins being shipped to Golden State Thursday , version 2.0 now is, \u201cAny contract can be traded.\u201d Wiggins was packed off to the Warriors with a pair of 2021 Draft picks in exchange for D\u2019Angelo Russell. In one fell swoop, then, Timberwolves basketball czar Gersson Rosas cleaned up two bits of unsuccessful business from last summer. The Wolves had their eye on Russell when he hit free agency out of Brooklyn but lost out to the Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant sign-and-trade with the Nets. They also wanted if at all possible to shed Wiggins for (in no particular order) his exorbitant contract, his lackadaisical play and his empty promises that he would, some day, do better. Now Wiggins joins a championship-proven franchise, with adult stars and a experienced coach who will hold him accountable. He has three years and $93 million left on his $148 million deal, but now faces little pressure to play up to that salary. If he can be a reasonable facsimile of Harrison Barnes from the Warriors\u2019 Finals editions in 2015 and \u201916, Wiggins will make his new bosses happy. He needed a reset and gets it \u2014 assuming, that is, he gets it. The Timberwolves needed this deal badly. The fan base in the Twin Cities has hit bottom, its patience sapped with just one playoff appearance \u2013 through multiple regime changes \u2014 since \u201904. Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns has grown increasingly frustrated, while incapable of leading the necessary changes in play and attitude himself. Now he has his good buddy Russell on board \u2013 the scoring guard\u2019s fourth team in five years, by the way. Golden State swaps out a guy who largely was a placeholder in the backcourt for another who can play alongside them and cleans up its payroll too. Andre Drummond took to Twitter soon after he had been dealt to Cleveland. But instead of dealing in hashtags, he should be more concerned with toe tags. The deal had an unmistakable whiff of the continued death spiral of traditional NBA centers. No one does what Drummond does quite as well, pounding the offensive glass for multiple chances and routinely posting 15\/15 nights. Defensively, he takes up space and has had a plus net rating every season. But guys of his size and skill have been out of fashion for several seasons, and with most of the teams mimicking the Golden State\/Houston style of spread offense small ball, the market has largely dried up. Look at Houston, which might not win an NBA championship in shipping out center Clint Capela, but would dominate all the Napoleon basketball leagues (6-foot-5-and-under division). Giving up Capela\u2019s rim running now to open the middle for James Harden and especially Russell Westbrook is a grand, risky experiment. Sixty or more 3-point attempts might become the Rockets\u2019 nightly target. Y\u2019know, maybe in a backwards way, this could spark a mini-resurgence of the big man \u2014 at least when teams play Houston, when they post up all their guys taller than P.J. Tucker. When Drummond first was made available in this trade market, the word was Detroit was concerned he would opt out of his contract this summer and leave as a free agent. But closer we got to the deadline, murmurs suggested a worse outcome might be Drummond opting in to the $28.7 million remaining on the contract. Next thing we know, he\u2019ll be heading over to Germany to play alongside his former Pistons teammate Greg Monroe, another big squeezed out by the 3-ball.  Andre Iguodala got what he wanted \u2014 a trade to a legit contender , now that he\u2019s joining coach Erik Spoelstra, Jimmy Buter and the rest in Miami. Memphis got what it wanted \u2014 some players and, at the very front end of Iguodala\u2019s arrival, a Warriors first-round pick. But how both parties got there sent a mixed message to other Grizzlies players and might have established a dangerous precedent. Iguodala didn\u2019t want to join Memphis. Memphis, having traded for him, was okay with that. And yet the Grizzlies paid Iguodala anyway, sending checks as part of his $17 million salary while the veteran forward played golf, explored investment opportunities, promoted a book and on and on. The mess was born in presumptions that Memphis would struggle this season. Except the Grizzlies seem to have turned a corner toward playoff contention, and young cornerstones such as rookie guard Ja Morant and second-year big man Jaren Jackson Jr. could have benefited from a seasoned veteran\u2019s voice, as could the Memphis coaches. It got late early, though, to the point neither side was backing down. So when Iguodala finally got traded to Miami, where he\u2019ll actually be expected to play, and the move earned some notice around the NBA: They call this a copy-cat league. So it wasn\u2019t just business between Iguodala and the Grizzlies; 29 other teams are going to have to deal with the ripple effects. THE CLIPPERS. They were better set up in money, in roster build and in assets on hand to wade into this trade market and it paid off handsomely: they acquired Marcus Morris Sr. from the Knicks, a player they\u2019d had their eyes on before the season. Morris is a nuts\u2018n bolts, gritty player with deep playoff experience and in most ways \u2014 other than being able to cover multiple positions \u2014 a step up from Moe Harkless, who went to New York. The Lakers didn\u2019t have the pieces to attract a serious dance partner heading into the deadline. That means they\u2019ll have to live a while longer with two significant needs \u2014 a point guard to take some load off LeBron James and lessen reliance on Rajon Rondo, as well as a D-and-3 wing. Their likeliest paths to outside help are the buyout market (who wouldn\u2019t want to jump aboard a James contender in sunny California?) and reports that former NBA guard Darren Collison might revoke his June retirement to join them. Bottom line, though, is that the Clippers believe what many around the league suspect: they are nearly or completely the Lakers\u2019 equals. The Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy will be up for grabs this spring and while owner Steve Ballmer, coach Doc Rivers and the rest have been OK drafting NASCAR-style behind their Staples Center housemates to this point, the trade deadline means it\u2019s time to get a heavy right foot, right now. More players wondered whether they might get traded than actually did. Happens every year on this day. Similarly, more teams decided to play the cards they\u2019d been dealt rather than go toss in for a draw, seeking some season-altering deal. That happens most years too. When things are going well, as they have been in Milwaukee, Toronto, Boston, Denver, Oklahoma City and at the Lakers\u2019 end of the hall, why tinker? So often, the best improvement comes from within and the goal is to be playing better as a unit in April than in October. The teams cited all are reaching or exceeding their offseason expectations. Fiddling with chemistry or pecking orders can go sideways quickly, which is why many GMs eschew the deadline deal. In a recent interview with HoopsHype.com, for instance, Indiana basketball boss Kevin Pritchard talked of a lesson he learned from his predecessor, Larry Bird. \u201cLarry was always like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to make trades in the middle of the season. I don\u2019t want to really hurt people\u2019s lives. I don\u2019t want to uproot families,\u2019\u201d Pritchard said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t do a trade to look like you\u2019re doing things. \u2026 The truth is, behind the scenes, there\u2019s just as much work when there\u2019s no activity on the front lines.\u201d Philadelphia added wing depth and shooting Thursday because it was sputtering from that obvious need, among several. Miami felt a need for a veteran defender in Iguodala and tried mightily to add Danilo Galinari\u2019s shooting. Houston frankly seemed as driven by money issues as stylistic ones. The Clippers pounced to close the gap, or open one, on the Lakers. And certainly, many transactions offer a longer horizon, as far as clearing cap space for future free agency or sidestepping the luxury tax. Then there\u2019s Indiana, which hopes it has the best of both worlds. The Pacers got former All-Star Victor Oladipo back after a year\u2019s layoff from a ruptured quadricep. They added talent to a team in the middle of the East playoff chase, without giving up a thing. And even they need to adapt, improvise and overcome, as evidenced by their three consecutive losses through Wednesday. Doing something can break in many directions. Doing anything? Not good, time and again. Public pressure or trying to justify a fat executive paycheck is the worst reason to do a deal. None of what we saw Thursday qualified as one of those recreational or for-appearances-only kind of moves. But since we started this with a classic movie quote, we\u2019ll end it the same. As Paul Newman\u2019s character says at a pivotal point in \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d Sometimes nothin\u2019 can be a real cool hand.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Clippers will send Moe Harkless and a 2020 first-round pick to the Knicks for Morris, along with swap rights to their 2021 first-rounder and a 2021 second-round pick via Detroit. And they will send guard Jerome Robinson to the Wizards in exchange for Thomas. According to David Aldridge of The Athletic , the Clippers don\u2019t plan to keep Thomas. The 30-year-old Morris is averaging a career-best 19.6 points for the Knicks, who signed him to a one-year contract last offseason. New York recently cut ties with team president Steve Mills and is set to hire CAA player agent Leon Rose in his place. Thomas, a two-time All-Star and All-NBA second team member in 2016-17, will become a free agent if he\u2019s waived by the Clippers. The 30-year-old point guard is averaging 12.2 points and 3.7 assists while shooting 41.3% from 3-point. Via NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann Main Takeaway: In the Western Conference arms race, the Clippers have outbid the Lakers for the better of the two Morris brothers. Every team always needs more shooting, and the Clips have added the league\u2019s fifth-ranked 3-point shooter to play alongside Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Impact on Clippers: Morris has shot 43.9% from 3-point range, including 46.8% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers ( the fourth best mark among 158 players who have attempted at least 100 ). He\u2019s an upgrade over Harkless in regard to his shooting, his willingness to shoot, and his ability to create shots. He\u2019s 4-for-7 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or OT and three of those four buckets have come off the dribble in iso situations. Harkless ( second on the Clippers in deflections per 36 minutes ) is the better defender, but Morris isn\u2019t a major liability on that end and is a little bigger and stronger than Harkless. In regard to LA lineups, he\u2019s no more or less versatile. Impact on Knicks: The Knicks didn\u2019t get a winning season (or anything close to it) from all the vets they signed to short-term deals last summer. But they have managed to flip one of them for a future pick. Impact on Wizards: The Wizards have flipped a 5-9 30 year old for a 6-4 22 year old. Robinson could help what has been the league\u2019s worst defense (by a wide margin). It\u2019s up to their player development program to turn Robinson (who has an effective field goal percentage of 44%) into something useful on offense."},{"id":28837,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/heat-acquire-iguodala-crowder-hill-official-release","date":"2020-02-07","title":"Heat acquire Andre Iguodala, Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill","content":" MIAMI, Fla. \u2014 The Miami HEAT announced today that they have acquired three-time NBA Champion Andre Iguodala, Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill from the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Justise Winslow, James Johnson and Dion Waiters.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania are reporting the Cleveland Cavaliers are bringing the former All-Star center to Ohio. Drummond is being traded for guard Brandon Knight, center John Henson and a 2023 second-round pick. This season, Drummond is leading the NBA in rebounding (15.8 rpg) while also averaging 17.8 ppg, 2.0 spg and 1.7 bpg for the Pistons. He has played his entire eight-year NBA career with Detroit and is the No. 2 rebounder in team history . > More on reported trade * * * Knicks forward Marcus Morris has been a part of many playoff runs in his career and is in the midst of a standout season (19.6 ppg, 5.4 rpg). With the LA Clippers hoping for a deep playoff run themselves, he is reportedly on his way there . In a three-team trade, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Clippers will get Morris and Isaiah Thomas , the Wizards will get Clippers guard Jerome Robinson, and the Knicks will get Moe Harkless and a 2020 first-round pick from the Clippers. The Athletic\u2019s David Aldridge reports the Clippers will not be keeping Thomas once he is acquired. The Knicks also get the rights to Issuf Sanon from the Wizards, per The Athletic\u2019s Mike Vorkunov . > More on reported trade * * * The Minnesota Timberwolves have made a major change to their core.

Additionally, the Wolves are sending a 2021 protected first-round pick and a 2021 second-round pick to Golden State while the Warriors are sending Jacob Evans and Omari Spellman to Minnesota. Per Wojnarowski, the 2021 pick is protected to No. 3 and becomes an unprotected pick in 2022. > More on reported trade * * * The Washington Wizards and Denver Nuggets reportedly swapped guards on trade deadline day as the Wizards dealt away Jordan McRae for Shabazz Napier, per Candace Buckner of The Washington Post . Napier was dealt to Denver in the four-team, 12-player trade on Feb. 5 that centered on Clint Capela and Robert Covington. This season, he is averaging 9.6 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 5.2 apg and 1.1 spg, while McRae is averaging 12.8 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 2.8 apg. * * * Miami\u2019s trade with Memphis that landed it Andre Iguodala was thought to include a third team. It did, but it wasn\u2019t the squad most expected. Per multiple reports , the Minnesota Timberwolves \u2014 and not the Oklahoma City Thunder with Danilo Gallinari \u2014 joined in the trade by sending center Gorgui Dieng to the Grizzlies for James Johnson. In the originally reported deal, Johnson had gone from Miami to Memphis as part of the Iguodala swap. * * * The Philadelphia 76ers reportedly added two guards to their rotation in the wee hours of trade deadline day in Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III. As the trade deadline window neared its end, the Sixers got rid of a rotation player as well. Per multiple reports , the Sixers sent forward James Ennis to the Orlando Magic in exchange for a second-round pick. Ennis is averaging 5.8 points and 3.1 rpg in 15.8 mpg for the Sixers, appearing in 49 games off the bench. * * * The Atlanta Hawks have picked up another young big man to add to their growing roster of them, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . Portland\u2019s Skal Labissiere is headed to Atlanta for cash in a deal that gives the Hawks a young center it can develop. Labissiere has been out since Dec. 28 , when he suffered a left knee injury, but is averaging 5.8 ppg, 5.1 rpg and 1.3 apg in 33 games. * * * Houston has swapped one big man for another, it seems. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , the Rockets have acquired 6-foot-9 forward Bruno Caboclo from the Memphis Grizzlies for 6-foot-8 forward Jordan Bell (whom the Rockets acquired in the Robert Covington trade on Feb. 5). Caboclo saw his role with the Grizzlies diminish this year after showing signs of progress in 2018-19. He\u2019s averaging 2.8 points and 2.0 rebounds (after 8.3 ppg and 4.6 rpg) last season. Bell averaged 3.1 ppg and 1.9 rpg for the Timberwolves before being dealt to Houston. The teams are also exchanging future second-round picks in 2023 . * * * The Atlanta Hawks have made overhauling their roster before the trade deadline a goal and are continuing to do so \u2014 albeit in a smaller move. LA Clippers reserve guard Derrick Walton Jr. has reportedly been dealt to the Hawks for cash, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Walton, an undrafted player from Michigan, is averaging 2.2 points in 9.7 minutes per game this season for the Clippers, appearing in 23 games. * * * Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Heat are sending Justise Winslow, Dion Waiters and James Johnson to Memphis for Andre Iguodala, Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill. Waiters isn\u2019t expected to remain on the roster, per Yahoo Sports Chris Haynes . No Draft picks are changing hands in the deal.

Per reports, the Knicks are also strongly considering William \u201cWorld Wide Wes\u201d Wesley for a position in the Knicks\u2019 organization as well. The pair, per Begley, have a strong relationship. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Knicks are adopting a model that has gained popularity in recent years thanks to the Golden State Warriors (who hired former agent Bob Myers in 2012 ) and Los Angeles Lakers (who hired former agent Rob Pelinka as GM in 2017 ). In a statement released by the Knicks on Thursday, team owner Jim Dolan said the following: \u201cWe are actively looking for a new president of the New York Knicks and hope to conclude the search as quickly as possible. I am not selling, but I am determined to find the right leader for the Knicks who will ensure the long-term success of the team, just as we did with the hiring of Rangers president John Davidson.\u201d Davidson has served as president of the NHL\u2019s New York Rangers since last May. He came to New York after successful stints with the Columbus Blue Jackets (2012-19) and St. Louis Blues (2006-12). He was a former Rangers player from 1978-83 and worked for the MSG Network from 1986 to 2006. Rose represents several of the top players in the NBA, with a client list that includes Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and others. Per Wojnarowski, no formal deal is expected to be announced anytime soon but negotiations should begin soon and end shortly after the Feb. 6 trade deadline. Mills took over as team president shortly after the team parted ways with former team president Phil Jackson in June of 2017 . Under Jackson, the Knicks went 80-166 with zero playoff appearances from 2014-17. However, the Knicks\u2019 fate wasn\u2019t much better in the Mills era either. Since the start of the 2017-18 season, New York has also failed to make the playoffs and was 46-164 entering this season. At 15-36 this season, the Knicks are essentially out of the Eastern Conference playoff chase again and have had three different coaches (Jeff Hornacek, David Fizdale, Mike Miller) since the summer of 2017. Hornacek was fired after two seasons on the job (2016-18) while Fizdale lasted even less time. He was fired 22 games into this season and went 17-65 in 2018-19, his lone full season with the team. That tied the worst record in franchise history, but team officials believed a big summer could lead to a quick improvement. However, they couldn\u2019t sign any of the top free agents despite having enough money to afford two of them, watching as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving instead went to the Brooklyn Nets. Mills then pivoted to sign veteran players to short-term contracts, later insisting those were the players New York was targeting all along. Mills also oversaw the surprising trade of then-injured former All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks in 2019 and the 2017 trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Knicks did find some promising talent in the Draft while Mills was in his role, unearthing wiry big man Mitchell Robinson with the 36th pick in 2018 and selecting RJ Barrett with the No. 3 pick in 2019. Overall, the Knicks have made the playoffs five times in the last 20 years, with the last trip coming in 2012-13.

But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not planning to upgrade their roster before the playoffs. According to Marc Stein of The New York Times , the Lakers are expected to give a tryout to free-agent guard JR Smith, potentially as early as next week. In addition, Stein reports that the Lakers are the favorites to land veteran guard Darren Collison if he decides to return to the NBA. However, the Lakers aren\u2019t the only team interested in Collison. According to multiple reports, the Clippers are also interested in adding the veteran guard who last played with the Indiana Pacers during 2018-19. The 32-year-old guard averaged 11.2 points and 6.0 assists in 76 starts for the Pacers last season, but he has yet to decide if he plans to return to the NBA this season. Smith played only 11 games for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season before he requested a trade, which he never received.

Detroit will receive Brandon Knight, John Henson and a second-round pick in return for the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in rebounds and field-goal percentage. Cleveland, which is just 13-39 this season, was expected to be aggressive at the deadline and signs pointed to the Cavs moving either star forward Kevin Love or center Tristan Thompson, who is in the final year of his contract and will be a free agent this summer. Drummond has been with Detroit since the team drafted him No. 9 overall in 2012. Still just 26 years old, the eight-year veteran was Detroit\u2019s only All-Star from 2010-18 and made the All-NBA third team in 2015-16. Blake Griffin broke Drummond\u2019s All-Star streak last season, but has played just 18 games this year due to a knee injury. Despite his individual production, Drummond experienced little team success in Detroit, appearing in the postseason just twice. On both of those occasions, the Pistons were swept in the first round. * * * From NBA.com\u2019s Michael C. Wright Main Takeaway: Detroit more or less let it be known it\u2019s building for the future by trading Drummond to Cleveland. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, now appear to have a suitable alternative for the possible departure of Thompson, whose contract is set to expire. Impact on Cavs: Since Drummond has said he plans to decline his option for next season, it\u2019s worth wondering whether this is merely a three-month lease, considering what the Cavaliers reportedly gave up to acquire him. Knight and Henson are on expiring contracts, and we all know deals like that carry value for teams looking to shed salary. So, in essence, Cleveland gets a chance to see what Drummond can do with Collin Sexton and Darius Garland. It\u2019s worth pondering what happens next with Thompson. The Cavs will also have Bird rights for a sign-and-trade if Drummond declines his option. Multiple teams leading up to the trade deadline have reportedly discussed a trade with the Cavaliers for Thompson, whose $18.5 million contract is expiring. He\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and he\u2019s reportedly not interested in accepting a buyout. Impact on Pistons: Looks like a salary dump here. The league\u2019s leading rebounder (15.8 rpg), Drummond has a $28 million option for next season that he\u2019s said he planned to decline. So, if Detroit didn\u2019t trade Drummond and he declined the option, he would\u2019ve become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, which means the Pistons would have let him walk for nothing. Still, one has to believe his value was higher. Drummond is averaging a career-high 17.8 points, and has won three rebounding titles in addition to making two All-Star appearances. But for many, he is an old-school throwback type of player that no longer fits with what teams want to do these days. Teams want 3-point shooting at every position, and Drummond\u2019s game is limited to inside the paint on the offense. Defensively, Drummond definitely does his fair share to generate steals and log blocks, but he\u2019s not considered one of the league\u2019s elite rim protectors."},{"id":28893,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dewayne-dedmon-jabari-parker-atlanta-hawks-sacramento-kings-trade","date":"2020-02-06","title":"Reports: Kings trade Dewayne Dedmon to Hawks for Alex Len, Jabari Parker","content":" ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Dewayne Dedmon reportedly is returning to the Atlanta Hawks in a trade that sends center Alex Len and forward Jabari Parker to the Sacramento Kings.

Atlanta on Wednesday acquired center Clint Capela from Houston as part of a 12-player, four-team trade. Capela is seen as a foundation player for Atlanta, along with guards Trae Young and Kevin Huerter and forward John Collins.

Obviously, there\u2019s ones that hurt a little bit more. Zach [LaVine] hurt a lot, Cov is up there. So the last 24 hours, I haven\u2019t slept much. I think I fell asleep [Tuesday] at like 5:30, 6 a.m. \u201cI\u2019ve been losing for a long time. I\u2019m not trying to do that anymore. Every possession means a lot. You obviously see my patience running low with a lot of things, so there\u2019s no excuses, we\u2019ve got to get it done.\u201d Besides their losing skid, the Wolves were also reeling from the loss of locker-room personalities. Aside from Covington and Jordan Bell, the Wolves also parted ways with Shabazz Napier, Keita Bates-Diop and Noah Vonleh in the trade. \u201cThose guys are big parts of the locker room and for us to lose all of them, obviously it changes a lot,\u201d Towns said. \u201cIt changes the vibe up here because we\u2019re missing four amazing guys first off, and four guys that we all count on for energy.\u201d Against the Hawks, the Wolves never led and struggled to recover from an early 14-4 run at the end of the first quarter that had them playing catch up the rest of the way. Atlanta led by as many as 21 points. They certainly missed Covington, one of their better defenders since arriving last season. Towns completed a three-point play with 1:25 remaining to cut Atlanta\u2019s lead to seven and Okogie\u2019s dunk with 48.4 to play made it 122-117. Vince Carter hit a 3-pointer, Okogie missed a 3, and the Hawks shot free throws the rest of the way. Overall, Towns tried to be professional about Covington\u2019s departure and take a longer view of things. \u201cYou can\u2019t take it personal,\u201d Towns said, per the Star Tribune. \u201cCan\u2019t think of it any other way. It\u2019s a business. I hope this is a great learning experience for [the young players] because this is what it is. You could be very close and you could be with someone you cherish a lot and they could be gone the next day.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":28919,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-four-team-trade-capela-covington","date":"2020-02-06","title":"Clint Capela, Robert Covington on move in massive 4-team deal","content":" Reports surfacing regarding Minnesota\u2019s reported pursuit of D\u2019Angelo Russell morphed into something much more complicated late Tuesday night, and on Wednesday, the Houston Rockets, Atlanta Hawks, Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets agreed to a multiplayer trade involving Clint Capela and Robert Covington as the main pieces in the transaction. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Shams Charania of The Athletic first reported the flurry of moves. In the trade, the Rockets get Covington and Jordan Bell from the Wolves and the Hawks\u2019 2024 second-round pick. The Hawks get Capela and Nene from the Rockets (Atlanta then waived Nene a day later). The Nuggets get the Wolves\u2019 Keita Bates-Diop, Shabazz Napier, Noah Vonleh, the Rockets\u2019 Gerald Green (who was later waived) and Houston\u2019s first-round pick in 2020. The Wolves get the Nuggets\u2019 Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez and Jarred Vanderbilt as well as the Hawks\u2019 Evan Turner and the Hawks\u2019 2020 first-round pick via the Brooklyn Nets. Wojnarowski reported Wednesday morning that the Hawks are waiving forward Chandler Parsons and his expiring $25.1 million contract to create the roster space needed to help complete this massive trade. The Hawks requested waivers on Parsons on Wednesday night. On Wednesday, videos of Covington arriving in Houston began to make the rounds on social media. He briefly spoke with reporters at the airport about what the looming trade to Houston means to him. \u201cIt\u2019s another great opportunity for me to be here,\u201d Covington said after landing in Houston, per the Houston Chronicle . \u201cI have family, friends here, being with an organization that is right there. It\u2019s a big opportunity for me. Just come in and do what I\u2019ve been doing. They just said I bring value, bring so much to the table. I\u2019m just going to bring that same energy every day here.\u201d The Houston Chronicle also reports the trade is unlikely to be finalized until Thursday\u2019s 3 p.m. deadline and could take days to be official. The trade can also still be expanded, with the Rockets potentially pursuing additional trades that can be made a part of this four-team mega-trade. For a second, though, forget all the names and Draft picks and focus on Capela and Covington, the Rockets and the Timberwolves. The Rockets receive the \u201c3-and-D\u201d wing it coveted, while the Hawks land a young, athletic, rim-running big to play with All-Star guard Trae Young. Now Atlanta owns the luxury of playing either John Collins or Capela with Young at all times to execute the pick-and-roll. After producing three straight seasons with improving numbers in nearly every category, Capela has regressed slightly on the offensive side this season (13.9 ppg). Still, he has pulled down at least 20 rebounds eight times this season, while increasing his rebounding average to a career-best 13.8 rpg. Capela\u2019s strong roll game should provide Young and Atlanta with a dangerous pick-and-roll threat to complement Collins up front. The fact that Capela is one of the NBA\u2019s fastest bigs should turn out to be yet another advantage for the Hawks in matchups as Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert have learned in recent years. Capela, 25, had been Houston\u2019s most valuable trade asset with a salary of $14.9 million this season and salaries of $16 million, $17.1 million and $18.2 million over the next three seasons as part of the five-year, $90 million extension signed in July of 2018 . The Rockets reportedly aren\u2019t done, either, as they\u2019re planning to continue beating the bushes for a center through a trade or in the buyout market to match up in the Western Conference playoffs against All-Stars such as Jokic, Gobert and the Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis. Houston isn\u2019t looking for a starter at the position, according to multiple reports. The plan now is to continue playing small ball with P.J. Tucker operating at center, while finding a center the Rockets can use in matchup situations against more traditional bigs down the road and in the playoffs. Tucker scored 13 points to go with 10 rebounds in Tuesday\u2019s 125-110 Rockets win over the Charlotte Hornets, marking the veteran\u2019s sixth double-double of the season. In that game, he also snapped a 21-game streak of scoring less than 10 points. Houston owns a record of 27-10 dating back to last season when Tucker scores in double figures. The win against Charlotte gave Houston its 15th in a row at the Toyota Center, and the Rockets have won six of their last eight after losing a season-high four in a row before that from Jan. 15 to Jan. 20. Covington, meanwhile, is now fully healthy after working through a knee issue last season and is regarded as one of the league\u2019s prototypical \u201c3-and-D\u201d wings, capable of playing strong multi-positional defense, while knocking down 3s at a solid rate (35.8% career). With Houston leaning primarily on small-ball lineups \u2014 including recently playing a game without a player taller than 6-foot-6 \u2014 the 29-year-old Covington adds an in-his-prime swingman to help further open the Rockets\u2019 high-octane offense without sacrificing on D. Covington is averaging 12.8 ppg and 6.0 rpg this season while also this season while knocking down 2.3 3-pointers per game at a 34.6% clip.  Furthermore, Covington was a strong locker room presence in Minnesota. It will be interesting to see how he fits in with Houston\u2019s dynamic personalities, a group led by All-Stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Beasley headlines the package going to Minnesota along with Turner, while Denver receives several depth pieces, such as Green, who is out for the season due to a broken foot, and a 2020 first-round pick. Beasley has struggled with his shot this season (39.2 FG%; 36.4 3P%) after a breakout 2018-19 campaign averaging 11.3 ppg off the bench for the Nuggets. According to The Denver Post , Beasley and Hernangomez had approached Nuggets management recently about a trade, as they sought expanded roles and more minutes in a situation only complicated by the emergence of rookie Michael Porter Jr. This move helped to solidify roles within the roster, and reportedly helped the Nuggets to avoid spending in restricted free agency on Beasley or Hernangomez. * * * Michael C.

According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Jokic is the 10th player in NBA history with a 30-20-10 triple-double, and only the second in the past 35 years to have such a triple-double in a win. DeMarcus Cousins is the other player. Jokic had the stellar night against one of the league\u2019s best defenders in Rudy Gobert. He was 14-of-24 from the field, including 13-of-14 when Gobert was guarding him, and 2-for-4 at the free throw line. Of his 21 boards, six were on the offensive end.

Red-hot Raptors host Pacers Indiana is still working Victor Oladipo back into its mix and the returns from their All-Star swingman have been mild. However, he is expected to see an uptick in minutes \u2014 and may even start \u2014 against the Raptors ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). This game tips off a two-game, home-and-away set between two squads fighting for a spot in the East hierarchy. Indiana is 1-0 in the series, winning an OT thriller back in late December, but overall the Pacers are slumping with three losses in their last four games. The exact opposite is true of Toronto: it has won 11 in a row and ranks second over the course of the streak and had its second most efficient performance of the season (129 points on just 97 possessions) against Chicago\u2019s 10th-ranked defense on Sunday. 2. Big test ahead for Magic Orlando has a thin grip on the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference, holding a four-game edge over the Chicago Bulls for that spot. When it comes to playing East teams that it could face come playoff time (as in those over .500), the Magic are a meager 15-14 . Tonight\u2019s game against the Boston Celtics ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ) comes a little less than two weeks since the team\u2019s last matchup (which Boston won handily). Orlando has lost five of its last six games and hasn\u2019t beaten a team over .500 since Jan. 15, so it needs a win tonight for a variety of reasons. 3. Big man showdown in Salt Lake City Denver has impressed over the last week, scoring a home win against Utah and road wins against Milwaukee and Portland (last night). The Nuggets can keep things going as they visit ( 9 ET, League Pass ) a Jazz team that has gone backward of late . This game intrigues for a lot of the reason last week\u2019s did: another chance to watch All-Star centers Nikola Jokic and Rudy Gobert go at it in the post. In their last meeting, Gobert guarded Jokic for 8 minutes and 43 seconds and Jokic didn\u2019t shrink in the moment. He scored 19 of his 30 points, going 8-for-14 overall and 1-for-2 on 3-pointers. 4. Critical road swing starts for Heat Fresh off an impressive 36-point win against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, the Miami Heat have a somewhat challenging West coast road trip ahead. The first stop couldn\u2019t be tougher as they visit the Clippers ( 10 ET, League Pass ) followed by Sacramento (on Feb. 7), Portland (Feb. 9), Golden State (Feb. 10) and Utah (Feb. 12). To date, the Heat are struggling to win on the road against the West, going 3-6 this season in those games. Miami has the unenviable task of keeping Kawhi Leonard in check as he is in the midst of a bit of a hot streak (27.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 5.2 apg, 1.9 spg over his last six games). 5. On this date: Some legendary debuts Two NBA championships. Two Finals MVPs. One Rookie of the Year. Thirty-two All-Star appearances. And so much more.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Philadelphia was pursuing additional trades to open roster spots and avoid having to waive two players. * * * After much smoke surrounding the Minnesota Timberwolves reported pursuit of D\u2019Angelo Russell , the Wolves are a part of a four-team trade with the Hawks, Nuggets and Rockets that shifts Robert Covington and Clint Capela (among others) to new locales. All four teams confirmed the terms at 11 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The deal was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Shams Charania of The Athletic late Tuesday night. In the trade, the Rockets get Covington and Jordan Bell from the Wolves and the Hawks\u2019 2024 second-round pick. The Hawks get Capela and Nene from the Rockets. The Nuggets get the Wolves\u2019 Keita Bates-Diop, Shabazz Napier, Noah Vonleh, the Rockets\u2019 Gerald Green (who is injured) and Houston\u2019s first-round pick in 2020. The Wolves get the Nuggets\u2019 Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez and Jarred Vanderbilt as well as the Hawks\u2019 Evan Turner and the Hawks\u2019 2020 first-round pick via the Brooklyn Nets. > More on the four-team trade * * * Derrick Rose, whose on-court resurgence has continued in controlled fashion with the Detroit Pistons, is likely to remain with the franchise that signed him in July, according to a report from Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports. Goodwill indicates the former Kia MVP would like to stay with Detroit despite the Lakers, Clippers and Jazz making inquiries, and that it would take a lottery pick on offer for the Pistons to \u201cseriously consider\u201d a move. * * * The Atlanta Hawks are continuing to bolster their frontcourt rotation, according to a report by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, who indicates the Sacramento Kings will send Dewayne Dedmon to the ATL, along with a pair of second-round picks originally belonging to the Rockets (2020) and Heat (2021). In exchange, Alex Len and Jabari Parker are headed to Sacramento. Dedmon had a breakout two-year stint with the Hawks after latching on in 2017-18; a summer signing with Sacramento fizzled once it came time to hit the hardwood \u2014 Dedmon\u2019s averaged only 15.9 minutes across 34 games, a drop of nearly 10 per game from last season in Atlanta. On the Kings side, according to Marc Stein of The New York Times , the reported deal would free up a significant amount of cap space for the coming offseason, potentially allowing Sacramento to match offers for restricted free agent Bogdan Bogdanovic. * * * The Miami Heat have traded for veteran swingman Andre Iguodala, according to a report by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Miami has also reportedly agreed to a 2-year, $30-million extension with the 2015 NBA Finals MVP. Wojnarowski adds that Justise Winslow will headline the return package , and Miami is also working with Oklahoma City to acquire Danilo Gallinari. Per Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, the Lakers were attempting to make a deal for Iguodala, but couldn\u2019t sway Memphis. Iguodala hasn\u2019t played for the Grizzlies since being traded by the Warriors over the summer; with the team\u2019s approval, he\u2019s been on standby , apart from the rest of the roster until further notice. Iguodala played in 68 games for Golden State in 2018-19, averaging 5.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 23.2 minutes. > More on reported deal * * * Updating a Tuesday item that had guard Luke Kennard potentially headed to Phoenix for a first-rounder and a few players, a report by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski indicates the potential deal has been scuttled due to disagreements over protections on the pick. * * * Multiple teams reportedly are inquiring about Lakers guard Alex Caruso, according to a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. The 25-year-old undrafted guard has quickly become a fan-favorite in Los Angeles during his first three seasons in the league. In 46 games with the Lakers this season, Caruso is averaging 5.5 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 18.4 minutes. According to Eric Pincus of NBA TV and B\/R, the Lakers have received more calls about Caruso \u201cthan just about anyone else\u201d on their roster. * * * The Suns reportedly are listening to trade offers for forward Kelly Oubre Jr., according to a report from Marc Stein of the New York Times. The Suns (20-30) have struggled with injuries this season, but remain just 5.0 games out of the No. 8 seed in the West. The Suns acquired Oubre from the Wizards in a trade last season and re-signed him to a 2-year, $30 million contract in the offseason. In 48 games this season, Oubre is averaging career-highs for points (18.5) and rebounds (6.7) in 34.3 minutes. * * * Former All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell has been involved in several trade rumors over the past couple of weeks. The latest team reportedly interested in the 23-year-old guard is New York, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic. However, per Charania, the Knicks have not included enough in their offers to entice the Warriors, who acquired Russell in a sign-and-trade with the Nets last summer. The Timberwolves also reportedly were interested in Russell, but the Warriors moved on from those conversations yesterday, according to Charania . * * * The Rockers were part of the reported four-team, 12-player mega-deal on Tuesday that saw them part with their starting center, Clint Capela, to acquire Robert Covington from the Minnesota Timberwolves. Houston is apparently working quickly to fill its center-sized hole by closing in on a deal for one , reports Kelly Iko of The Athletic. Houston is speaking with two unnamed Eastern Conference teams, Iko reports, about a center. Additionally, the Rockets are willing to take on additional salary in exchange for assets in a trade. * * * As one of the top two-way guards in the NBA, the Pelicans\u2019 Jrue Holiday is a name on the minds of many a team as the trade deadline nears. He\u2019s having another solid season, averaging 19.7 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 6.3 apg and 1.7 spg \u2026 and it appears he may not be going anywhere come Feb. 6. Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports the Pelicans have yet to receive the kind of overwhelming offer it would take to pry Holiday from their roster. * * * Elite teams in the NBA are often some of the first to find a way to get better at the trade deadline, and the LA Clippers could be a part of that group. Andrew Grief of the Los Angeles Times reports the Clippers are active in trade talks about centers and lengthy wings and guards who can score. They\u2019re also keeping tabs on former Pacers guard Darren Collison, who recently retired but last month was said to be mulling an NBA return . * * * Veteran big man Tristan Thompson was reportedly made available in trades earlier this week, and now it seems the asking price for him may be set. According to Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com, the Cavs want a first-round pick in return in any trade involving Thompson. The Athletic reported on Tuesday that Thompson\u2019s camp wants him traded before Thursday and per Fedor, multiple teams have expressed interest in Thompson. The Los Angeles Times \u2018 Andrew Grief reported Tuesday that Thompson is not a focus of the Clippers right now.  * * * Davis Bertans has been a true success story for the Washington Wizards this season and his 3-point marksmanship was rewarded Tuesday with a spot in the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest . Bertans\u2019 shooting ability and overall game have made him an enticing potential trade target, too. However, Candace Buckner of The Washington Post reports that while the Wizards have gotten many offers for Bertans, they don\u2019t plan to trade him . In fact, they have designs on re-signing him this summer, Buckner reports. * * * After two-plus seasons, it appears the Indiana Pacers are ready to part with former first-round pick T.J. Leaf. The power forward, who is averaging 3.0 points and 2.7 rebounds per game this season, has appeared in just 22 games (and just one game since Jan. 1). J. Michael of the Indianapolis Star reports the Pacers are trying to move the forward after they have become unhappy with the big man\u2019s development. * * * The New York Knicks reportedly have had \u201cexploratory conversations\u201d with the Los Angeles Lakers about acquiring forward Kyle Kuzma, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic. The Lakers may have interest in adding Knicks veteran forward Marcus Morris, who reportedly has received interest from \u201cseveral contenders\u201d, according to Charania . Kuzma, who is in his third season with the Lakers, is averaging 13.0 points and 4.2 rebounds over 39 games this season for the West-leading Lakers."},{"id":28925,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-trade-deadline-buzz-feb-4","date":"2020-02-05","title":"NBA trade deadline 2020: Feb. 4 roundup","content":" The NBA trade deadline is just two days away ( Feb. 6, 3 p.m. ET ).

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Minnesota has been engaged in trade talks for weeks with Golden State about Russell for weeks and is looking to construct a multi-team deal that would bring the former All-Star guard to the Wolves. The Rockets and Hawks are currently part of the discussions, but the trade could possibly become a four-team deal. Wojnarowski is quick to point out, though, that there would be a lot of work involved in pulling off such a deal. Update (9:19 ET): Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer reports that Andrew Wiggins would go from the Timberwolves to the Warriors in any version of the trade that involves Russell. Without the lead guard on the move, O\u2019Connor reports the deal would involve Robert Covington (MIN > HOU), Clint Capela (HOU > ATL), and \u201cdraft assets\u201d (ATL > MIN). Update (10:37 ET): Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that Golden State is \u201cmoving on\u201d from discussions with the Timberwolves. Wojnarowski updated his reporting to indicate that the three-team possibility (Minnesota\/Atlanta\/Houston) remains, and the Warriors are looking to \u201cshed salary and lower [their] tax bill \u2014 as well as bring back some draft value.\u201d Update (11:05 ET): A followup from Charania lists Minnesota, Atlanta and Houston in \u201cserious discussions\u201d regarding the three-team deal outlined earlier. He notes that Evan Turner would accompany any draft compensation from Atlanta. * * * The New York Knicks reportedly have had \u201cexploratory conversations\u201d with the Los Angeles Lakers about acquiring forward Kyle Kuzma, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic. The Lakers may have interest in adding Knicks veteran forward Marcus Morris, who reportedly has received interest from \u201cseveral contenders\u201d, according to Charania . Kuzma, who is in his third season with the Lakers, is averaging 13.0 points and 4.2 rebounds over 39 games this season for the West-leading Lakers. * * * Andre Iguodala remains one of the more sought-after names on the trade market. The Miami Heat, as one of the East\u2019s elite teams, are reportedly in the mix of teams seeking Iguodala, per Shams Charania of The Athletic . The Grizzlies are seeking a favorable trade for Iguodala and it is also believed he would rather end up with the Lakers or LA Clippers this season, per Charania. * * * With 32 games to go in 2019-20, the Memphis Grizzlies have astounded many by staying in the thick of the Western Conference playoff chase. They\u2019ve done this behind the play of rookie Ja Morant and youngsters such as Jaren Jackson Jr., Dillon Brooks and others. After the Grizzlies won in Detroit last night, Brooks made it known that he can\u2019t wait for the team to part ways with veteran forward Andre Iguodala. >  More on Brooks\u2019 comments * * * Kevin Love delivered a classic performance in an overtime loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night, finishing with a season-high 33 points to go with his 13 rebounds in a 139-134 loss . As the Feb. 6 trade deadline approaches, Love\u2019s name has been mentioned at times but he told reporters after last night\u2019s game he expects to stay with the Cavs going forward. > More on Love trade chatter * * * Last season, Timberwolves forward Robert Covington was a player involved in the early-season, Jimmy Butler-to-Philadelphia blockbuster swap. Covington again is being mentioned in trade talks \u2014 most notably by comments ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski made in a recent podcast  \u2014 but Covington told Chris Hine of the Star Tribune he is doing what he can to tune all that out. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from somewhere,\u201d Covington told the newspaper. \u201cSomebody said something or somebody is trying to create a buzz. You never really know the truth until something actually happens. A lot of stuff is just speculation a majority of the time.\u201d * * * In an effort to shore up its backcourt rotation, Phoenix could be looking to acquire Detroit guard Luke Kennard. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the Suns\u2019 first-round pick, Elie Okobo and Jevon Carter are in play, though what protections might be placed on that pick are unknown. The 12th overall pick of the 2017 Draft, Kennard is averaging career highs in points (15.8), rebounds (3.5) and assists (4.1) but has not played since Dec. 21 due to bilateral knee tendinitis. > More on Kennard trade chatter * * * New York forward Marcus Morris has heard his name mentioned in trade talks over the last few days. He was the catalyst in the Knicks\u2019 139-134 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers last night, scoring 26 points in the victory. Morris is on a one-year, $15 million contract but said after last night\u2019s game he wants to stay in New York, per Steve Popper of Newsday : \u201cI\u2019ve said it since the day I stepped here, I want to be with the Knicks. It\u2019s not my call. We\u2019re getting to the deadline. Me personally, I love being here and I want to continue to be here.\u201d * * * Before the Celtics took on the Atlanta Hawks (and eventually won) last night, Boston\u2019s president of basketball operations, Danny Ainge, made some comments about the state of his team as the trade deadline nears on the team\u2019s pregame show. Per Boston.com\u2019s Nicole Yang , Ainge said he\u2019s most concerned about the Celtics\u2019 roster being fully healthy and may explore trades to strengthen the end of the bench. But, he also said: \u201cWe do have probably too many really young guys. We certainly don\u2019t want to make a deal just to make a deal.\u201d"},{"id":28927,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mtn-dew-3-point-contest-participants-announced-official-release","date":"2020-02-04","title":"Lillard, Young, two new shots highlight 2020 MTN DEW 3-Point Contest","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Defending champion Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets and NBA All-Stars Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers and Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks will participate in the 2020 MTN DEW\u00ae 3-Point Contest on Saturday, Feb. 15 at the United Center in Chicago.

It\u2019s the start of a three-game road trip. So as Robert Covington wakes up in his hotel room hours before the Sixers take the court, it seems like a regular day in the league\u2019s grueling 82-game marathon. Until he checks his phone. \u201cI get up, start getting ready for shootaround,\u201d Covington says, reliving the moment to NBA.com. \u201cBrushing my teeth. Didn\u2019t look at my phone until I was getting ready to walk out of my room. And next thing you know, I had (a ton) of notifications that were saying I had been traded.\u201d Covington said his agent was unaware of any potential deal at the time, and the veteran forward who spent four seasons in Philadelphia claims there was no heads up from the front office. So the first thing Covington saw when he reached for his device was an alert that read: ESPN breaking news, Philadelphia\u2019s Robert Covington and Dario Saric traded to Minnesota for Jimmy Butler. \u201cThat was all throughout my notifications,\u201d Covington said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I found out.\u201d Typically, players who have been traded initially hear the news from their respective team or agent. Dario Saric was included in the deal with Covington, and he found out over a FaceTime call with Sixers coach Brett Brown. The difference between the two is an illustration of what happens after a trade is finalized: Teams may have every intention to tell its players or their agents before reporters find out, but the lightning-fast news cycle enabled by social media can sometimes make that goal difficult. Several current players spoke to NBA.com about when they first learned they\u2019d been traded. Spoiler alert: It wasn\u2019t always via phone calls from agents or front office representatives. * * * It\u2019s the 2017 offseason, and Grizzlies guard Ben McLemore has just gotten married. He and his wife are celebrating overseas, so he decides to share the moment with fans on social media. It\u2019s the fans, however, who have something to share with him. \u201cI was on my honeymoon,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in Ibiza with my wife. I was on Facebook Live and then someone on the live [stream] said, \u2018 Yo Ben, you going back to Sacramento? \u2019 And then my wife said something. She must have been on social media and saw. So I ended the live.\u201d  McLemore found humor in the situation and was actually elated to be heading back to the Kings, where he spent his first four NBA seasons. The details were confirmed when McLemore received a call from the Grizzlies afterwards, but it was Facebook Live that provided McLemore the information and fans a chance to act as reporters. Such would be the case for Jeremy Lamb\u2019s followers on Instagram. \u201cI had just got done getting a haircut, and then I saw it on Instagram,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cI was at home. I had just got a cut, and I posted the cut to shoutout the barber. Then people commented saying, \u2018 Dang you just got traded .\u2019\u201d Lamb, who said the trade was \u201ccompletely unexpected,\u201d had just been drafted by the Houston Rockets and was eagerly anticipating his NBA debut. But three days before the 2012-13 regular season began, the former NCAA champion was shipped to Oklahoma City as part of a blockbuster deal for James Harden. Instagram, only two years old at the time, was the outlet that broke the news to Lamb and forced an immediate call to his agent. \u201cHe said it was true,\u201d Lamb recalls. Facebook and Instagram are two of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms, and players have discovered some life-altering news through both. Yet, you\u2019ll never see the phrase #NBAFacebook or #NBAInstagram, no matter how big a presence the league has on both. That\u2019s strictly saved for #NBATwitter. Considering the 10-letter hashtag and Twitter\u2019s standing as the fastest resource for news in today\u2019s society, it makes sense that players have found out they\u2019re on the move through this rapid tool. \u201cI found out on Twitter in the locker room,\u201d Jared Dudley said.  Dudley was in the Clippers\u2019 practice facility during the summer of 2014 when his name flashed across his timeline as part of a three-team pact between Milwaukee, Phoenix and LA. \u201cI had just got done working out for the Clippers in the summer pick-up [game],\u201d said Dudley, who would shortly learn he was heading to the Bucks. \u201cI was scrolling on Twitter. It said I had just been traded. About 10 minutes later, I got a call from my agent.\u201d Dudley has played for eight different franchises, with several trades contributing to his nomadic career. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 13-year veteran responded to a tweet back in September from former Laker Josh Hart, who had just been traded to New Orleans. Hart wrote , \u201cAs a player you just want the courtesy of a phone call saying I got traded and not finding out on Twitter.\u201d Dudley responded by saying that\u2019s \u201cnot the nature of this business.\u201d Veteran guard Garrett Temple shares a similar state of mind, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the life we live in now.\u201d Temple was traded for McLemore in the aforementioned Kings-Grizzlies trade. Like McLeMore, Temple received the message via an untypical sender. \u201cThe first time I found out was over social media, but I was cool with that,\u201d Temple said. \u201cMy friend texted me and said, \u2018 You going to Memphis? \u2018 He texted me Adrian Wojnarowski\u2019s tweet.\u201d * * *  Learning from a close friend or family member that it\u2019s time to pack your bags isn\u2019t exactly an aberration either. Eric Gordon was once riding a bus with season-ticket holders when his brother texted him the news. Hart\u2019s brother showed him Woj\u2019s tweet while the shooting guard was playing video games. George Hill was coming out of a workout when friends texted him saying, \u201c Bro, you\u2019ve been traded. \u201d \u201cStuff like that you hear from them.\u201d Hill said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t hear it from the direct source.\u201d That alternate source can be a teammate. Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu and Chris Kaman were traded for Chris Paul in a mega-trade between the LA Clippers and New Orleans Hornets in 2011. As Gordon spoke with his brother, Kaman sauntered over to Aminu for a quick, candid conversation. \u201cWe were all on the bus,\u201d Aminu recalls, \u201cand Chris came and looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m traded!\u2019 Then he said, \u2018Farouq, you\u2019re with me.\u2019\u201d It happens. Before Kelly Oubre Jr. was a member of the Phoenix Suns, he was originally headed to the Grizzlies. That trade fell apart due to a rather bizarre reason , and Oubre\u2019s destination changed the next day. But it was still teammates who let Oubre know his time with the Washington Wizards was over. \u201cThey saw Woj tweet it or whatever, and then they told me when I got out the shower after we played the Nets,\u201d Oubre said. \u201cJohn [Wall] told me, [Markieff Morris] and [Bradley Beal]. They all kind of huddled around me and broke the news to me.\u201d Oubre is currently enjoying Phoenix, but he still laments how his ordeal went down. Many players struggle with the news itself when it comes to being traded, especially for the first time. It\u2019s an utter shock. And when the public finds out before they do, without any warning to soften the blow, it only makes the experience tougher. \u201cIf you\u2019re working on trading somebody, let them know,\u201d Oubre said. \u201cLet them know beforehand when it crosses your mind. They want us to communicate if we\u2019re sick or if we have personal issues at home and can\u2019t make it to work, so let us know if y\u2019all think you\u2019re gonna trade us.\u201d It\u2019s a fair point, that Oubre raises, but perhaps not pragmatic. Teams sometimes don\u2019t want to risk having a disgruntled player on the roster when a deal isn\u2019t even guaranteed to be agreed upon. Vince Carter is a respected future Hall of Famer, with a 22-year career spanning four decades,  and even he has discovered transactions that included himself without a heads up. Like Oubre, Carter was dealt from the East coast to Phoenix. It was 2010, and Carter became aware of the move through another unconventional manner. \u201cI found out through the [ESPN] ticker that I was traded from Orlando,\u201d he said. \u201cI was sitting with my family on December 17. We were watching TV. I just said, \u2018Hey, let me flip through the channels.\u2019 And then I thought I saw my name and I was like, \u2018Hold up, hold up.\u2019 I saw Vince Carter traded to the Phoenix Suns . That\u2019s how I found out.\u201d  It\u2019s even happened to retired players. Randy Foye laced up his sneakers for seven different franchises over 12 seasons. He found out that his first NBA team was moving on from him through an NBA blog site. On another occasion, a push alert from the NBA app revealed the news. When the latter deal happened, Foye says members of the Denver Nuggets front office let him know that a trade could potentially go down. He remembers being told before practice to \u201cjust go downstairs and hang out in the lounge, and if it goes through, we\u2019ll be the first people to let you know.\u201d That, of course, didn\u2019t happen. \u201cI\u2019m just browsing the web looking at what\u2019s going on,\u201d Foye said. \u201cThen, I put my phone down, started looking at the TV cause NBA TV was on, and I look back at my phone and an alert pops up. I unlock my phone, and it says, \u2018 The  Thunder acquire Randy Foye\u2019 \u2026 So I hear [some front office personnel] coming down the stairs to let me know, but I already knew. So I sneak out the side door. I didn\u2019t have my car at the practice facility, my wife had dropped me off. So I typed in an Uber and asked them to take me to my house.\u201d Asked why he left the facility, Foye continued. \u201cI was giving them my all,\u201d he said. \u201cGary Harris is my young guy, and to be honest, they started playing Gary Harris more. They let me know during the second half they\u2019re going to try to develop him, and I was fine with it. So I wanted to be traded, but I didn\u2019t want to move because my girls were in school and my wife and family were there. So when it all went down, I didn\u2019t really want to see anyone because I was there for a while, and I know it would have been emotional. Everyone handles it differently.\u201d * * * When a deal is completed, the two front offices \u2014 usually having done their business over the phone \u2014 each notify the league. From there, coaches, owners, agents and players are looped in. \u201cEach one of those people you talk to, you don\u2019t know who they\u2019re going to talk to,\u201d said one former Eastern Conference general manager, speaking anonymously. \u201cVery quickly, you go from two people agreeing on a deal to 10 people knowing about the deal, and [those] 10 people have all of their series of relationships.\u201d In addition to the amount of parties involved, the methods teams use to contact a player varies.  A general manager can\u2019t always pull a player to the side before practice, or be standing outside the shower with his bags and a message attached. When players are on the road during the season (like Covington), or overseas during the offseason (like McLemore), the line of communication is even more complex. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the game of telephone,\u201d the former GM said.  During a Western Conference road trip in 2007, Kyle Korver received an incoming call from across the country. It was then-Sixers general manager Ed Stefanski with some significant news to share. The only problem? Korver was asleep. \u201cI missed the phone call, saw it and was like, \u2018Why are they calling me?\u2019\u201d said Korver, who then learned he was traded to the Utah Jazz through the voicemail Stefanski had left. Korver, a 16-year veteran who\u2019s been dealt five times, had no hard feelings. \u201cTeams honestly do their best to tell players first, but with so many sources, it\u2019s hard for them.\u201d What makes it even harder is the unique swiftness of today\u2019s platforms and devices. Practically everything moves quicker than it did when Korver was first traded. Despite that, learning on social media can still sting more than a call from an agent or team representative \u2014 for some, at least. For others, it\u2019s just reality.  \u201cHow you find out is how you find out,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cYou\u2019re still getting traded.\u201d * * * Khari Arnold is a senior producer for NBA.com.

"},{"id":28950,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-knicks-parting-ways-steve-mills","date":"2020-02-04","title":"Knicks, team president Steve Mills part ways","content":" The New York Knicks have made one of the bigger moves of trade deadline week \u2014 in the front office. The Knicks are parting ways with team president Steve Mills, who had been in his role since July of 2017 , confirming reports of the news from earlier Monday. In the shakeup, GM Scott Perry will continue in his role for the foreseeable future while also overseeing the team\u2019s basketball operations. In the team\u2019s statement , the Knicks said they anticipate Mills being \u201cnominated to the Board of the standalone sports company, following the completion of the proposed spin-off entertainment business, pending all necessary approvals, including by the MSG Board.\u201d Team owner Jim Dolan is quoted in that same statment as saying: \u201cSteve and I have come to the decision that it would be best for him to leave his role as president of the New York Knicks. We thank Steve for his many years of service to our organization and look forward to continuing our relationship with him as a part of our board.\u201d Additionally, the moving on from Mills is because owner Dolan plans to target Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri to oversee the Knicks\u2019 operation, per multiple reports. Ujiri is under contract through the 2020-21 season. Mills took over as team president shortly after the team parted ways with former team president Phil Jackson in June of 2017 . Under Jackson, the Knicks went 80-166 with zero playoff appearances from 2014-17. However, the Knicks\u2019 fate hasn\u2019t been much different in the Mills era either. Since the start of the 2017-18 season, New York has also failed to make the playoffs and was 46-164 entering this season. At 15-36 this season, the Knicks are essentially out of the Eastern Conference playoff chase again and have had three different coaches (Jeff Hornacek, David Fizdale, Mike Miller) since the summer of 2017. Hornacek was fired after two seasons on the job (2016-18) while Fizdale lasted even less time. He was fired 22 games into this season and went 17-65 in 2018-19, his lone full season with the team. That tied the worst record in franchise history, but team officials believed a big summer could lead to a quick improvement. However, they couldn\u2019t sign any of the top free agents despite having enough money to afford two of them, watching as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving instead went to the Brooklyn Nets. Mills then pivoted to sign veteran players to short-term contracts, later insisting those were the players New York was targeting all along. Mills also oversaw the surprising trade of then-injured former All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks and the 2017 trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Knicks did find some promising talent in the Draft while Mills was in his role, unearthing wiry big man Mitchell Robinson with the 36th pick in 2018 and selecting RJ Barrett with the No. 3 pick last year. Overall, the Knicks have made the playoffs five times in the last 20 years, with the last trip coming in 2012-13. Now it will be up to Perry to decide if there\u2019s any moves worth making for the Knicks before Thursday\u2019s trade deadline. Their big trade from last season appears to be a failure, as Porzingis has helped spark a turnaround in Dallas after New York traded its former All-Star there on Jan. 31, 2019. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":28973,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-mailbag-feb-4","date":"2020-02-04","title":"Kia MVP Ladder mailbag: Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons on outside looking in","content":" From a talent standpoint, the Philadelphia 76ers are stacked with the type of it that usually produces elite results. Even to the untrained eye, the Sixers\u2019 raw talent is obvious. So why haven\u2019t the Sixers been able to consistently perform at the high level their talent suggests they should? The missing piece, of course, is a chemistry problem. The Sixers don\u2019t have it down yet and they are paying for it in the standings. They\u2019re not the contender they were expected to be. Not even close. And while All-Stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons will represent the franchise at NBA All-Star 2020 in Chicago , neither one of was in the latest Kia Race to the MVP Ladder . In a season dominated by dynamic All-Star duos, the absence of both Simmons and Embiid from the conversation is perplexing. The Sixers have lost three straight games as well as four straight and 10 of their last 12 on the road. Each of those road losses have been by at least 10 points. They are 15-15 against .500 teams and, as Monday night\u2019s 31-point beating at the hands of Miami showed, nowhere close to figuring out how to right things during this critical stretch of the season. But Sixers coach Brett Brown understands where his team is right now and where they have to go to get on track with their internal expectations before they worry about any external pressures. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us have figured it out perfectly,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis for sure is evolving, at times slower than you wished. But you blink and you\u2019ve got the best home court record in the NBA. We\u2019ve got All-Star [announcement] on the books and there\u2019s tremendous sort of resources to get where we want to go. \u201c I think with Ben and Jo[el], what is it now the third iteration of the, trying to figure out whatever team they\u2019re trying to play with? There hasn\u2019t been a steady diet of a similar group. That counts for something. And the good news is that we play defense. We do play defense. The other side of it is evolving with pace and posting Jo and turning Ben loose and the other fits around it is \u2026 evolving.\u201d Could be. But it might not be in time for Embiid or Simmons to make any serious headway into the MVP debate. * * * Player(s) of the week: Once again it\u2019s on for Damian Lillard, who won Western Conference Player of the Week honors for a second straight week. His current run is nothing short of epic and if he keeps it up, run for cover. Jaylen Brown took home the honors in the East, which I\u2019m sure is no consolation for the gut-punch he received last week when he wasn\u2019t selected as an All-Star reserve (teammate Jayson Tatum was, however). Foolish to worry about Zion?: So much for being torn about Zion Williamson making his rookie debut 45 games into the season in New Orleans. Zion has made himself extremely comfortable in the lineup in short order. He\u2019s gone from coach Alvin Gentry wanting to bring him along slowly to Gentry fuming over his team\u2019s inability to feed the rookie phenom the ball in critical moments. I apologize for not believing fully in the power of Zion. It won\u2019t happen again. Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . From: Henry Horsley Jan. 28, 2020 | 9:31 p.m. Before I start saying my opinion on next week\u2019s MVP ladder I would just like to say your columns are my favorite thing about the NBA this season. Each time I read the mailbag you really get me thinking. Anyway here I go: LeBron deserves the MVP. Watching LeBron and watching Giannis is a whole different sensation. When I watch Giannis to me it looks like a man who is just trying up his stats. There is no doubt Giannis is having a great season, but the saying that he is the entire Bucks team just isn\u2019t true. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe are also key factors In Milwaukee\u2019s dominance. But Giannis throws a very big shadow on them. He is not making either of those two any better \u2014 just the team. An MVP is a person who is making their whole team much better, not just themselves. LeBron, on the other hand, is doing just that. You cannot just care about your stats when you are getting 10-plus assists a game. No doubt that the Lakers\u2019 many new additions are making the Lakers better, but without LeBron doing all of this MVP-caliber stuff I could see them only being 5th or 6th seed. The Lakers are all working together to become the best team possible, but you cannot say LeBron is not the center of that. He is making his teammates better, his team better, himself better, and giving his team a very good chance of getting to the finals this year. And to me that is the definition of an MVP. Here are my top 5: 1. LeBron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Kawhi Leonard * * * My response: Thanks for kind words Henry, I appreciate it. But I have to disagree with you on the narrative that Giannis is padding stats and that he doesn\u2019t make his teammates better. And I am sure all of his teammates would disagree as well. The Bucks thrive off of the attention he draws offensively. Both Giannis and LeBron fuel their teams, the entire team (and organizations overall]. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019ve been 1-2 what seems like forever on the Ladder the season. Kawhi two-ways  From: Beverly Giannoni Jan. 29, 2020 | 12:07 a.m. Have you taken into account that Kawhi plays both ends of the floor and I do not think any of the players you have above him does this as well as Kawhi. Also, have you remembered that Kawhi has scored 30+ points in EIGHT consecutive games? Perhaps you need to rethink your picks. * * * My response: All of that information has been factored into the Kawhi equation, Beverly. With all due respect, I don\u2019t feel like my picks need anything more than the rigors weekly analyzation thy already get. And since when is a top three slot on the Ladder seen as a sign of disrespect?  From:  Cameron Smith Jan. 29, 2020 | 8:24 a.m. Russell Westbrook and James Harden can be one of the biggest threats with such a strong big man (Clint Capela) and even the bench. They all can score and sometimes they do that better than others. But, with that being said, if Harden does not end his slump it is just like Devin Booker and the Suns. In the West, it takes more than one star to make noise. The Rockets have the assets to win The Finals, but coach Mike D\u2019Antoni needs to put together a equilibrium between Westbrook and Harden and then the rest of the team also. So with that being said, right now I would say Westbrook is moving up the list to become an MVP candidate and Harden is moving down. We also know that the Rockets are just a talented team in general. For example, Eric Gordon just came back and he had been scoring 20 and 25 points almost every night. Then, we saw him drop a career-high 50 on Utah when Westbrook and Harden sat out. That is an example of backup leadership and is exactly what you need from a benched veteran. With that being said my top 5 for MVP is: 1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. James Harden (maybe) * * * My response: With all the trade rumblings right now involving Capela\u2019s name, we\u2019ll have to see if is still a fit for the Rockets moving forward before factor Capela into this equation. You had to know Harden would shoot his way out of that January funk eventually, Cameron. I agree, though, that the development of the core group beyond James and Russ is of vital importance to the Rockets\u2019 longterm outlook this season. If they don\u2019t have those roles clearly defined by the time the playoffs hit, it could be a problem for Mike D\u2019Antoni and his crew. From: Victor Andrades Jan. 29, 2020 | 4:14 p.m. I believe you got it right this time Sekou. Even though I am biased toward Kawhi, I see where I can add a few things: No. 1: Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 Has lived up to his name \u201cGreek Freak\u201d numbers and done amazing as a player and leading his team. No. 2: LeBron James \u2014 Gets credit over Kawhi for playing every day, putting up great numbers and again leading his team. No. 3: Kawhi Leonard \u2014 The reigning Finals MVP (enough said), he impacts an leads his team and is a \u201cstealth assassin.\u201d I just saw him have very meek (for him) against my Miami Heat. And the guy sitting next to him criticized him at halftime. My response to him was the last thing anybody in this game needs worry about is whether Kawhi will show up. He will show up and he will be heard from loud and clear before it\u2019s over. He finished that game with his first career triple-double .  No. 4: Luka Doncic \u2014 An amazing talent and competitor, his time is coming. He\u2019s fun to watch and is having amazing impact on his team and made them a contender. No. 5: Jimmy Butler \u2014 My man all the way! Amazing impact on this team. Reminds me of one of my favorite sermons by preacher named Russ Ewell (\u201cwhat can one man do? Anything God wants him to do!\u201d) He has had the most impact because of how much he has lifted the Heat to elite status. All the others here had All-Star support and championship expectations when 2019-20 started \u2026 except Butler * * * My response: No arguments from me, sir. The floor was yours and you stomped all over it! From:  Pieter de Winter Jan. 30, 2020 | 12:43 a.m. I regularly read your MVP Ladder and I enjoy all the thoughts of you and others that are being put out there. But, there is one thing that is been bugging me ever since I started reading your conversation: that you (and others) also consider players with losing records as possible MVP candidates. Of course, I agree that some of these players \u2014 like Damian Lillard and Trae Young \u2014 are very good players. But if their teams don\u2019t win games, they shouldn\u2019t be in the MVP conversation. * * * My response: I do have a hard time ignoring the team\u2019s overall record when making my MVP evaluations, Pieter. So don\u2019t feel all alone out there my man. It\u2019s rare that you will find someone on the Ladder from a team that\u2019s struggling the way the Hawks are and the Trail Blazers were before Lillard went nuclear. Both of those guys made the cut on the latest Ladder.     . Giannis or LeBron \u2026 with eyes on Zion  From:  Paul Ngwilimi Jan. 30, 2020 | 2:30 a.m. This season has been magnificent! From the start, players have been playing to make a statement for themselves and for their teams as championship contenders. In my opinion, the MVP should mostly be either Giannis or LeBron James. This is because these two have showed max effort in giving their teams more wins in the regular season rather than playing for self glory (sorry, Mr. Harden). With Lakers and Bucks having the best records in the NBA so far this season, I believe the MVP should go to either one of them \u2014 but I mostly favor Giannis Here\u2019s my top 5 1: Giannis Antetokounmpo 2: LeBron James 3: Luka Doncic 4: Kawhi Leonard 5: Jimmy Butler * * * My response: You are clearly on right track right now, Paul. Giannis and LeBron have established themselves as the true frontrunners heading into the trade deadline and All-Star break. Zion is a fantasy MVP play right now, though. It\u2019s nice to dream about it but he\u2019s barely scratched the surface of what he\u2019s going to do. We need to see what sort of dent he can make in Ja Morant\u2019s lead in the Rookie of the Year race before we talk about anything else. From:  Madeleine Halverson Jan. 29, 2020 | 1:42 p.m. I\u2019ve always been really happy with your picks, but I\u2019ve been having some trouble whenever James Harden is on the list. I think consistency is very important. He has a lot of nights where he goes off, but he also has a lot of night when he is like 1-for-17. I don\u2019t think he should be on the list. I have to agree that he can be a great shooter but a lot of the time he has horrible nights. I don\u2019t think he should be in the running I\u2019m glad that Rudy Gobert has been making the list. He is super dominant on the floor and is very consistent. * * * My response: I know you came with the best of intentions, Madeline. But you don\u2019t think Harden even belongs on the list? Come on now. That\u2019s harsh even for the toughest Harden critic even after a tough shooting month. As you might have seen, he\u2019s bounced back here recently. Don\u2019t count him out. He could easily go on another tear or two and make a move back up into the top tier. From: James Denning Jan. 30, 2020 | 9:38 p.m. I know it seems wrong to all the people out there who love LeBron. I will admit, I am a Kawhi lover, but I would not send this if I did not think it was true. I see what LeBron can do, and I see that he is a leader of that team. I personally dislike him, but I respect his game. I think Kawhi has shown himself to be the bigger difference-maker though. Part of this belief is based on the matchups so far. Both times the Lakers and Clippers faced off, LeBron and AD were unable to finish games or show up (figuratively) when needed. LeBron said he re-aggravated a groin injury, but when you\u2019re on the court, you\u2019re healthy (especially when you are running across the court to sit in someone\u2019s lap). Kawhi has had to do a lot of stuff without his superstar pair. Paul George has been having a bad season from an injury standpoint. None of the Clippers\u2019 other guys are a two-way threat in the same universe as AD. One thing people bring up a lot is Leonard\u2019s injury management. Well, he only missed maybe one or two games that were not part of a back-to-back. I do not care too much for that, though I will admit that can be a deciding factor for who gets second and third between those two. To sum it up, I believe he should be higher than LeBron because he has had to do more and dominates LeBron when they match up. I can\u2019t say much about Giannis and Jimmy Butler deserves to be where he is, I believe. * * * My response: I\u2019m sorry, James, I got lost after you professed love for Kawhi and respect for LeBron. That\u2019s a rarity: fans of one player doling out respect like that for a hated rival. Then again, you seemed to weave all the way back to some serious shade for LeBron (and that\u2019s much more like it). I have a hard rule in these situations: if I have to tear down someone else to make a case for my guy (whoever that might be), then it\u2019s a pretty weak case to begin with. All of these guys have strong resumes. So feel free to tout your guy and let him stand on his own merits. Middleton in the mix?  From: Landon Bangerter Jan. 31, 2020 | 4:11 p.m. Hey Sekou! You\u2019re friendly neighborhood MVP pal Landon is here and a month or so long hiatus. Let\u2019s get right back into it! I really like your list this week. And being a Jazz man myself, I\u2019m really glad you have Gobert in your top 10. Keep up the good work! We really only have two big disagreements this week. My first is the lack of Khris Middleton. In my opinion, you can\u2019t only put one player from a team of only six losses on an MVP list out of 15. Middleton has been balling, and scored 50-plus a couple of nights ago for a win. He\u2019s been valuable to Milwaukee and should at least get a mention. My second is how high Damian Lillard is. I have him barely in my honorable mentions, but to put him in the top 10 when he has a losing record. Granted, he\u2019s been incredible. But he\u2019s not win-ning his team as many games as he should be. With all that said, here\u2019s my personal ladder this week: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 2. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers 3. James Harden, Houston Rockets 4. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers 5. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks 6. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers 7. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 8. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat 9. Khris Middleton, Milwaukee Bucks 10. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz And five more: Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz; Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers; Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics * * * My response: Thanks for coming back, sir. And your points are duly noted. But just so we\u2019re clear, I can absolutely include just one member of any team. If we\u2019re being completely fair \u2014 which I\u2019ll admit is a standard we don\u2019t always meet in the season-long MVP chase \u2014 we probably shouldn\u2019t allow teammates on the Ladder and should make hard choices. No sharing of anything, one MVP candidate per team as a standard. Since that\u2019s not our reality, I\u2019ll save that theory for another day. And your second complaint doesn\u2019t hold up well given Dame Dolla\u2019s current tear. You need him on your list, pronto! Some thoughts on Trae \u2026  From:  A  ustin Duff  Jan. 31, 2020 | 2:56 p.m. Where\u2019s Trae Young in your MVP race? He\u2019s third in scoring and second in assists \u2026 and he can\u2019t crack your top 15? What do you have against him? * * * My response: I hear you Austin. I debate it every week: what to do with Trae? As outlandish as some of his performances have been, how do you rate him ahead of guys who are impacting winning at a much higher level than he is? He\u2019s a starter on the All-Star team, which I think is ample recognition for what\u2019s doing statistically. But around here, there has to be some winning going on as well. That\u2019s non-negotiable. \u2026 and more thoughts on Trae  From:  Tyler Fielder Jan. 31, 2020 | 5:17 p.m. I am a huge fan of your rankings and a die-hard NBA fan. I\u2019m a first-time writer and long-time fan, but really just wanted to make a comment about Trae Young. To be a second year player in the top three in points and assists is unprecedented. The burden he carries as a second-year player with little to no supporting cast is incredible. I know that record has a lot to do with the regular season MVP, and I don\u2019t expect Young to be anywhere near the top 5. But I do think he deserves some love at least in the top 15. His stats are arguably as good, or better, than Doncic\u2019s. He has also been playing with considerably less help yet he was voted as an All-Star starter (and the top vote-getter among East guards) despite his team\u2019s struggles. I know it takes a lot for someone on a bad team with a horrible record to be given consideration, but I think it is time to realize the greatness we are seeing and throwing some credit his way. Have a peek at some advanced stats of his and feel free to give me a shout of what you think! * * * My response: Glad you joined us Tyler, welcome. See the response directly above about Trae. And I don\u2019t like the hypocrisy of using his stats as a case for his inclusion on the list while also denigrating his help (or lack thereof) as a way of explaining why his team is suffering. That burden, at least some of it, has to fall on the dude dominating the ball if you want to give him all the credit when things go right. Trae\u2019s time will come if he is as good as we all think he is. It\u2019s just not right now. From: Mactastic Ent Feb. 1, 2020 | 1:25 a.m. First off, I want to say I love checking in on your weekly MVP posts. The literature is quite entertaining, yet educational. My question\/comment is: how could you not put Dame higher on your list? He\u2019s literally demanded our respect year in and year out. People talk about Russell Westbrook (among others) saying he never cheats the game as far as effort. But even beyond just the stats, Dame should clearly be mentioned higher on your list. He\u2019s literally carried the load and put the team on his back night in and night out And if that\u2019s not MVP-worthy, I don\u2019t know what is. Anyways keep up the great work, and I can\u2019t wait to see your list next week. * * * My response: Dame\u2019s sure to be on the move, Eul. Trust me, he\u2019s squarely in the mix after back-to-back Western Conference Player of the Week nods. There\u2019s no lobbying necessary. His play is doing all the talking for him right now. #NoHypeManNeeded From: Dario Garcia Segura Feb. 2, 2020 | 11:46 a.m. My name is Dario and I love basketball. I am from Spain and I want to ask you one question: What must LeBron do to rise to No. 1 on your MVP Ladder? Thank you and hugs! * * * My response: LeBron needs a monster stretch and a simultaneous struggle stretch from Gian-nis to push his way to the top. At least that\u2019s a good place to start. And you are welcome and hugs back to you! From: Yuval Sharon Feb. 2, 2020 | 3:42 p.m. To expand on my previous email, I will rank my new top five with my reasoning and then the next five. 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo: No explanation needed 2. Kemba Walker: He has made the Celtics one of the best teams in the East and he is also putting up good individual stats even when facing really good defenses. 3. Luka Doncic: He\u2019s averaging a near triple-double and leading his team to the sixth seed in the West. 4. Kawhi Leonard: He has been on a hot streak and is averaging very good stats on a team with other stars. 5. LeBron James: Again, no explanation needed. 6. Jimmy Butler 7. Anthony Davis 8. James Harden 9. Damian Lillard 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Pascal Siakam 12. Nikola Jokic 13. Rudy Gobert 14. Domantas Sabonis 15. Trae Young * * * My response: Your appreciation for Kemba warms my basketball heart, Yuval. I suspect you\u2019ll have plenty of folks disagreeing with placing him that high. And in turn there will be plenty of folks upset that you have LeBron all the way down in the fifth spot. The only reason Luka can slip \u2026  From:  Alexander Roedeske Feb. 3, 2020 | 11:20 a.m. I\u2019m back, Sekou, and this time I\u2019m bringing heat! Why do you have Kawhi over Luka? Kawhi definitely has been hot over the last month, getting his first career triple-double. Meanwhile, Luka has 20 triple-doubles so far in two seasons and is almost averaging one this season. He hasn\u2019t missed a game yet due to load management \u2014 only because of an actual injury. That and that injury alone should be the only reason Kawhi can possibly be over him in the MVP ladder. I\u2019m sorry for being a little harsh, but I just don\u2019t see why that is. * * * My response: I\u2019m a big boy, Xander. I can take a little constructive criticism. Luka\u2019s been fantastic this season, no question. But having more triple-doubles than Kawhi or anyone else doesn\u2019t qualify him for a higher spot in my eyes. That\u2019s just one component of the evaluation process. Kawhi is a far superior defensive player, which makes him a better two-way player by a significant margin. But I guess if you only use offensive numbers in your calculation, Kawhi\u2019s defensive prowess doesn\u2019t factor in his favor. Doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me. If you\u2019re going to evaluate parts of someone\u2019s game to make your case, then your \u201cheat\u201d doesn\u2019t turn the temperature up around here. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

They\u2019ve done this behind the play of rookie Ja Morant and youngsters such as Jaren Jackson Jr., Dillon Brooks and others. After the Grizzlies won in Detroit last night, Brooks made it known that he can\u2019t wait for the team to part ways with veteran forward Andre Iguodala. Iguodala wants a new home with a contending team, but if Memphis is unable to reach a trade that meets its liking, the former Finals MVP is reportedly willing to sit out the rest of the season. \u201cFirst time I seen him was on TV talking about us,\u201d Brooks said , per Mark Giannotto of the Memphis Commercial Appeal . \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even matter. Andre Iguodala is a great player. I feel like he\u2019s doing the right thing for his career, but we don\u2019t really care.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a distraction at all,\u201d he continued. \u201cI laugh at that type of stuff. A guy that\u2019s on our team doesn\u2019t want to be on our team. I can\u2019t wait til we find a way to trade him so we can play him and show him what really Memphis is about.\u201d The news regarding Iguodala potentially sitting out came last night via David Aldridge of The Athletic and he emphasized that the Grizzlies\u2019 season-long desire is to acquire assets in exchange for Iguodala rather than simply waive him for nothing. The 36 year old has not played a game since being traded to Memphis last offseason. The surprising Grizzlies, meanwhile, are 25-25 and in eighth place in the Western Conference. Via social media, Morant and guard De\u2019Anthony Melton appeared to back Brooks\u2019 stance with tweets. Morant\u2019s featured a shouting emoji, while Melton\u2019s had a shrugging emoji. Memphis acquired Iguodala \u2014 along with a 2024 first-round pick \u2014 early last summer via a trade with the Golden State Warriors.

Can Lillard keep things rolling? Sometimes, an NBA player is just in a zone for a stretch of games. If you need an example of this theory, look no further than Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard. He is averaging 48.8 points per game over his last six games and is fresh off a 51-point demolishing of the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. The Blazers visit the Nuggets tonight ( 9 ET, League Pass ) in a showdown that will surely test Denver\u2019s backcourt. As much as eyes will be tuned to Lillard vs. everybody in a Nuggets uni, don\u2019t overlook a good center matchup tonight, too, between All-Star Nikola Jokic and Portland\u2019s Hassan Whiteside. 2. The present vs. the future in Milwaukee Watching the work reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo puts in on the regular is always something to take in. But it wasn\u2019t that long ago that he was a spry rookie trying to find his way in the NBA hierarchy. Zion Williamson is hardly the same type of youngster Antetokounmpo was, but perhaps he could be a future Kia MVP winner someday, too? We\u2019re getting too far ahead of ourselves, of course, but its food for thought tonight as the Bucks host the Pelicans ( 7:30 ET, TNT ). As much as that matchup will overtake the spotlight, though, don\u2019t sleep on just how smart of a passing team the Bucks are this season. 3. Can Spurs find road success? The first game of San Antonio\u2019s rodeo road trip didn\u2019t go as expected as it lost to the LA Clippers, 108-105, on Monday . The path doesn\u2019t to success doesn\u2019t get easier as the Lakers await the Spurs next ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). The task is made even tougher by the play of Lakers forward Anthony Davis of late as he\u2019s averaging 29.7 points, 8.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists, while shooting 60.4% in the team\u2019s last three games. The Lakers might be particularly motivated tonight, too, by history: they can complete a season series sweep of San Antonio for the first time in 20 years. 4. On this date: \u2018Larry Legend\u2019 immortalized Back on Feb. 4, 1993, virtually everyone at the Boston Celtics\u2019 game that night was there to see someone who didn\u2019t play anymore. In a special two-hour ceremony celebrating his storied playing career, Larry Bird\u2019s No. 33 Celtics jersey was retired at sold-out Boston Garden."},{"id":28953,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-love-not-expecting-be-traded","date":"2020-02-04","title":"Kevin Love not expecting to be traded by Cavs","content":" Kevin Love delivered a classic performance in an overtime loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night, finishing with a season-high 33 points to go with his 13 rebounds in a 139-134 loss . As the Feb. 6 trade deadline approaches, Love\u2019s name has been mentioned at times but he told reporters after last night\u2019s game he expects to stay with the Cavs going forward. The game against the Knicks was the Cavs\u2019 last home game before the trade deadline as their next game is Feb. 5 in Oklahoma City ( 8 ET, League Pass ). When asked Monday if he thought this was his final home game with Cleveland, Love said he didn\u2019t think so. \u201cNaw, it\u2019s funny, I didn\u2019t even consider that, oddly, not until this very moment,\u201d Love said . \u201cIt could be the same thing for a few guys here. Tristan (Thompson) didn\u2019t play tonight, I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019ll let the chips fall, I\u2019ve been saying that. But I expect to probably finish the season out here and continue to play extremely hard.\u201d Thompson has been made available in trades, too, and was sidelined against the Knicks with a sore right quad. He worked out on the court before the game and the team announced he was out 45 minutes prior to tip-off. Coach John Beilein said Thompson got treatment after the shoot-around, but the leg was still bothering him before the game. Per Cleveland.com\u2019s Chris Fedor , a trade of Love was \u201cnot imminent\u201d despite the big man having a career-best season (11.9 ppg, 10.4 rpg). As for Love, he said after the game that he has not had detailed conversations with the team about his future. The team, per Love, has also not given him assurances he will remain there either. \u201cEarly on, that good advice was just chasing the game and let everything else fall back into place, everything else good in life will chase you right back,\u201d Love said. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard anything, don\u2019t know what to expect, but not pushing anything either way, just continue to be me, I guess.\u201d Despite all that, Love has remained productive and over his last 15 games is averaging 20.7 ppg, 8.9 rpg and 3.2 apg. Per Cleveland.com, the Cavs are reportedly convinced that trading Love will fetch a bigger return in the offseason than at the deadline. The Cavs, per Cleveland.com, will also not do a salary dump nor is it interested in attaching a pick in potential Love trades. Love apologized in early January for a string of incidents in which he was frustrated with the team and had outbursts. He was upset on the bench in a Dec. 31 loss to the Raptors and got into a verbal exchange with Cavs GM Koby Altman over being fined for those actions. On Jan. 4 in a loss to the Thunder, Love threw his arms up in disgust several times on the floor, fired a hard pass in anger and had his back turned on defense as one of the Thunder\u2019s players streaked past him for a basket. But for Love, he says he has nothing but positive memories about his time in Cleveland \u2014 however long that time may last. \u201cWhether it\u2019s five years when my time is done here, I\u2019ll reflect on how amazing it is and was,\u201d Love said. \u201cI\u2019ve just known so many great people here and had so many great moments. The way they were showing it on the screen tonight, the good old days. I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m at a loss for words, but I didn\u2019t even really think about it like it was.\u201d"},{"id":28948,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-pistons-suns-talk-luke-kennard-trade","date":"2020-02-04","title":"Report: Pistons, Suns talk Luke Kennard trade","content":" In an effort to shore up its backcourt rotation, the Phoenix Suns could be looking to acquire Detroit guard Luke Kennard.

This season, it appears Clint Capela is on the trade block and could be dealt before the Feb. 6 deadline. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , the Rockets are shopping Capela in trades with Eastern Conference teams \u2014 particularly three-way trades that might allow Houston to nab the draft assets to get an impact wing player. Per the report, the Rockets are hoping a potential trade of Capela \u2014 or Capela-involved deals \u2014 would net them a wing player by the 3 p.m. ET deadline on Thursday. According to Wojnarowski, the Hawks have shown interest in upgrading their center position and have talked with Houston about Capela (as well as with the Oklahoma City Thunder about center Steven Adams). In addition to the Hawks, the Rockets reportedly are in discussion with the Boston Celtics about Capela, per Wojnarowski. Houston leads the Southwest Division and has won three of its last four games \u2014 including recent wins against the playoff-contending Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks. The Rockets are, as always, led by their superstar guard tandem of Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Harden leads the NBA in scoring (35.7 ppg), while Westbrook isn\u2019t far behind, ranking 10th at 26.4 ppg. As good as that tandem has been, though, Houston has struggled to find a consistent answer on the wing behind that pairing. Ben McLemore is in the midst of a career resurgence and is averaging 10.3 ppg, starting 17 of Houston\u2019s 49 games. Additionally, swingman Danuel House has started 32 games and is also averaging 10.3 ppg. However, Houston is likely in search of a bigger talent upgrade at the position over that pairing.

It\u2019s just part of the business. But for the 450 players currently manning NBA rosters, some for the first time will endure the shock and disappointment of seeing a friend moved elsewhere on Feb. 6, the NBA\u2019s trade deadline . Sure, it\u2019s old hat for some. But that doesn\u2019t allay the sting of what\u2019s become the inevitable for the ultra-competitive NBA, where one move or a series of them can immediately enrich a team\u2019s fortunes for years. \u201cThis is the tension in the NBA,\u201d Milwaukee Bucks forward Kyle Korver told NBA.com. Traded four times himself over a career spanning 16 years in the NBA, Korver slipped on a jacket, leaned against a locker and sighed hard recalling his first heavy dose of the league\u2019s uncomfortable reality. It was 2006, his fourth season in the league with the Philadelphia 76ers. \u201cThe first trade that really opened my eyes to all of this is when Allen Iverson got traded from Philly,\u201d Korver said. \u201cHe was such a big part of my early career, giving me advice and building me up; [and me] seeing how he was a Philly icon, an NBA icon.\u201d The 76ers moved Iverson, then a four-time NBA scoring champion, on Dec. 20, 2006 to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith and a pair of 2007 first-round picks. The transaction served notice to Korver that nobody\u2019s safe. \u201cIf he can get traded, then we can all get traded,\u201d Korver explained. \u201cThat was kind of the first moment that was tough for me. This is my 17th year, and I\u2019ve been through a lot of trades, and I\u2019ve had coaches fired mid-season. I\u2019ve had a GM taken out. It\u2019s all part of the business, unfortunately. It\u2019s a beautiful game and a beautiful job in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t think GMs and teams purposely look at you [as just a name on a piece of paper]. \u201cBut it\u2019s their responsibility,\u201d Korver said. \u201cTheir jobs are on the line. They\u2019ve got to do what they\u2019ve got to do to create the best teams. But the best teams have chemistry, and chemistry happens through relationships on and off the court. So if you play with guys for a certain amount of time, you build relationships with them; when you go through playoff series, when you lose the last game, when things don\u2019t go well, when you win and the tough moments of the season. Incredible bonds are made through all that. When I was younger, having a coach be fired mid-season, and having players be traded, it felt like such a big deal. But after you spend time in the NBA, you realize this is just a part of it, and you can\u2019t take it personally. Everyone\u2019s just trying to keep their jobs.\u201d  San Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan understands the situation intimately. Traded from Toronto \u2014 the franchise he never wanted to leave \u2014 in July of 2018 along with Jakob Poeltl and a protected 2019 first-round pick in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, DeRozan was initially crushed by the Raptors\u2019 decision to part ways and gamble on Leonard for a shot at a title. DeRozan spent his first nine NBA seasons in Toronto and developed a close relationship with point guard and now best friend Kyle Lowry. Current teammate Rudy Gay, who played two seasons with DeRozan and Lowry in Toronto, helped smooth the transition into San Antonio. (And, for the record, Gay was dealt twice in 2013 before signing with the Spurs as a free agent in 2017.) \u201cRudy and Kyle have always been close,\u201d DeRozan told NBA.com. \u201cWhen Rudy came to Toronto, Kyle was there. But only me and Rudy were close. I didn\u2019t talk to Kyle at all [early on]. But me and Kyle became brothers. So now when we call, even if it ain\u2019t about basketball, we can talk [expletive] to one another. [After the trade], first I called Kyle. Then I called Rudy and he laughed. But that\u2019s just our friendship in the sense of Rudy being like, \u2018Man, I\u2019m laughing because I got my man back.\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure if I said I had gotten traded to somewhere else [other than San Antonio], he would\u2019ve been just as mad as me. Rudy said: \u2018To where?\u2019 I said: \u2018Man, to y\u2019all.\u2019 \u201cHe started laughing,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cIf [the trade would\u2019ve occurred] early in my career, I don\u2019t know how I would have taken it, not being established fully in life, still growing, still trying to understand the business of the league, how things work, understanding cities. Now, there\u2019s not much I haven\u2019t seen or been through in the league. Even coming here, I had played against one of the assistant coaches (Ime Udoka, a former Spurs player and assistant, who joined the staff last summer of the Philadelphia 76ers). I knew him from playing and coaching. You have these different relationships with coaches all around the league. So, when you make that transition, they know you and you know them. That made the trade a lot easier.\u201d Still, the suddenness of these transactions can be neck snapping. Orlando Magic forward Terrence Ross played with DeRozan and Poeltl in Toronto. On a Raptors road trip in February of 2017 , news came down as the team prepared for a rode trip that Ross would be traded to Orlando along with a 2017 first-round pick in exchange for Serge Ibaka. Poeltl was a rookie at the time.  \u201cAll of a sudden, he\u2019s just standing there like, \u2018Guys, I\u2019m out. I just got traded,\u2019 \u201d Poeltl told NBA.com. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time something like that really hit me. I was like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 It really just goes that fast. It\u2019s hard because us as players have to kind of try to put ourselves into a mindset where it\u2019s all business. You try and get close with these guys, and obviously you want to be around people that you want to spend time with. The reality of it is any day, one of them could just get traded or you yourself could get traded. Now all of a sudden, you\u2019re in a completely different locker room.\u201d Portland Trail Blazers wing Trevor Ariza quickly pointed out just how differently the public reacts when it\u2019s the player wanting out instead of the team making the decision. \u201cWhen a player decides what he wants to do, the narrative isn\u2019t always the same as when it\u2019s the organization that decides to make a trade,\u201d Ariza told NBA.com. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is. It\u2019s hard on families, especially when you have little children and they\u2019re getting moved around like that. I think most people in this league have had friends traded, and after so long you sort of just get used to it happening. Nothing surprises me anymore.\u201d Despite the cold nature of it all, some organizations make it a point to strongly consider the human element of the decisions they\u2019re pondering. Families are often left uprooted, forced to move into new cities after settling into their living situations. Children have to enroll in new schools and find new friends. Cleveland Cavaliers assistant coach J.B. Bickerstaff said the top organizations consider all those factors. \u201cSome organizations handle it differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThings like how long guys have been there, the relationship they have with their families, those types of things always play a part because the decision-makers are human too. If a guy\u2019s been there eight or nine years and you\u2019ve watched their kids grow up, that\u2019s a huge part of the decision you have to make. What I think you have to do in that situation is you have to put your emotions to the side. \u201cThe team\u2019s responsibility is what\u2019s best for the organization,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cThat\u2019s why their jobs are so difficult. I\u2019ve been in situations on a bad team where you have a good veteran, and out of respect for that veteran, you trade them to a contender and give him an opportunity to succeed. So, I think it can go both ways. I think the good organizations take that into consideration.\u201d That\u2019s certainly the case in San Antonio, according to Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who said the human element is considered \u201cto a significant degree,\u201d when making personnel decisions.  \u201c It depends on your relationship with the player, how long that player has been around, how important or not important he\u2019s been, how it will affect the rest of the group,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cDo you have something else in mind, like whoever\u2019s coming in in his place, does that suit what you thought you needed and didn\u2019t have? There\u2019s a lot of considerations. But the human element is there just like when you cut a guy. This guy has been thinking about this his whole life, and you cut him or maybe he\u2019s in a trade. He falls in love with San Antonio and everything is going well. His kids are in school, and then you decide for the good of the organization, you need to make a trade. That\u2019s hard stuff. So, the human element is always there.\u201d That goes for the players, too, as they spend more time with teammates over the course of a season than their own families. When a friend changes uniforms after being traded to another team, those close-knit relationships remain as strong as ever. Minnesota Timberwolves forward Robert Covington can attest after playing five seasons for the 76ers, \u201cwhere I literally had 29 teammates within one season.\u201d Now in Minnesota, Covington grew close to Treveon Graham and Jeff Teague, who were traded to Atlanta on Jan. 16 for Allen Crabbe. \u201cYour routine kind of gets messed up a little,\u201d Covington said. \u201cYou and a guy might hang out or go do certain things together, but once the person leaves, it\u2019s different. I kicked it with T.G. a lot. We had a good routine where we\u2019d hang out, talk about life, a lot of different things. I was close to his family. Overall, there were just a lot of things we had in common.\u201d  Did that change when Graham joined the Hawks? \u201cNothing changes,\u201d Covington said. \u201cHe\u2019s a part of what we went through, part of this team. So how you look at him doesn\u2019t change at all.\u201d Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert agreed. The Jazz cut Gobert\u2019s best friend, Raul Neto, over the summer. He eventually caught on with the 76ers. By then, Gobert had witnessed organizations move plenty of friends over seven years in the NBA. \u201c It happens. I mean, when Kyle Korver got traded. Alec Burks got traded for Kyle Korver, then Kyle Korver got traded with Jae Crowder for Mike Conley,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cAnd Derrick Favors in the summer [July 2019]. It\u2019s always tough when you go through so much with these guys. Especially us. We feel like we\u2019re a family. We go to war every night. Then you wake up the next day and find out they\u2019ve been traded. It\u2019s not just a business, but that\u2019s the business part. You don\u2019t win championships if you\u2019re not close, where you feel like you\u2019re a part of the family.\u201d That\u2019s partially why Gobert believes \u201cloyalty is kind of an illusion\u201d in the NBA. The reality is \u201cif your team can trade you for something better,\u201d he said, \u201cmost of the time, they\u2019ll do it.\u201d It still stings every time, Utah guard Donovan Mitchell said. \u201cAlec Burks got traded right before a game,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cDante [Exum], the same way. Jeff Green got [waived] right after a game. There are so many times when you don\u2019t expect it to happen. At the end of the day, those guys are your brothers. They\u2019re the guys you went to war with. So, you\u2019re always going to have love for those guys. I always keep in touch with pretty much all of them.\u201d  Jazz forward Joe Ingles said every teammate that has been traded over the last five years \u201chas hurt me some way.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll always be a friend, whoever it is,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cObviously, Dante [Exum] is a recent one. When we play [the Cavaliers], we\u2019ll enjoy kicking their [expletive]. But regardless, we\u2019re going to miss him every day. We still have relationships. I speak to Dante. I spoke to Jeff Green today.\u201d Back in San Antonio, Korver had just slipped out of the Bucks locker room after a Jan. 6 loss to the Spurs when point guard Eric Bledsoe caught wind of the trade conversation in which his teammate engaged. Coincidentally, when Phoenix traded Bledsoe to Milwaukee in 2017 for Greg Monroe and two 2018 draft picks, his first game with the Bucks came against the Spurs in San Antonio at the AT&T Center. Bledsoe laughed recalling the morning shootaround with his new team. He barely knew any of Milwaukee\u2019s plays, but still managed to score 13 points and dish seven assists hours later in his Bucks debut, a 94-87 win over the Spurs . \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to realize, man, that it\u2019s just the business,\u201d Bledsoe said. \u201c You learn that early. You don\u2019t understand it at first, but as you get older you understand it. You definitely don\u2019t in the moment. You get so many teammates, man, throughout your career that you\u2019ve just got to learn to adjust. I\u2019ve had so many teammates that that happened to I can\u2019t even remember the one that hit me the hardest. The truth is, man, it just keeps on going and going.\u201d * * * NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner contributed to this story. Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said \u201cthat will never happen again.\u201d Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has produced 30 points or more in 26 games while racking up at least 10 rebounds in 23 of those outings. \u2022 Wednesday, Feb. 5 (9 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Jan. 30, 2020 Yes, you saw this matchup last week, and here it is again with both players having made the 2020 NBA All-Star team. Gobert has won three of the last five head-to-heads against Jokic, who posted a 28-point double-double just last week to help the Nuggets best the Jazz. The pair matched one-on-one for a little more than six minutes in the last meeting, and Gobert connected on 4 of 5 for nine points. Jokic closed last week with his 10th triple-double of the season and 38th of his career, which puts him just five away from former Nuggets star Fat Lever for 9th all-time in triple-doubles.

George racked up 31 points, going 4-for-9 on 3-pointers the last time these players (which was when George was still on the Oklahoma City Thunder and Butler was on the Philadelphia 76ers). Butler is averaging career highs in assists (6.3) and rebounds (6.8) per game, and he\u2019s poured in 20 points or more in four of his last five games entering this week.

Oladipo played in just two games last week, so it\u2019s expected Oladipo will still be shaking off some the rust against Lowry, who was just named to his sixth consecutive NBA All-Star team. Going back to Dec. 1, 2017, Lowry and the Raptors had won four straight against Oladipo until the night of the 2019 quadriceps tendon injury, a 110-106 Pacers win over the Raptors. These teams face one another twice this week. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, Feb. 3 (10:30 ET, NBATV) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 21, 2019. Traded for one another in the summer of 2018, DeRozan and Leonard have battled to a few memorable performances over the past couple of seasons. Leonard has come out on top in three of the last five meetings, and racked up 26 points and nine assists to go with four steals when he faced DeRozan just before Christmas. DeRozan just reached 16,000 career points. Since he was drafted in 2009, only six other players have reached that scoring mark (LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry and LaMarcus Aldridge).

The squads meet tonight in Dallas ( 7 ET, League Pass ), but there is a little luster off this one due to injuries. Indiana will be without forward TJ Warren, who suffered a concussion on Saturday vs. New York and must finish the NBA\u2019s mandated protocol before returning. Dallas is without All-Star guard Luka Doncic for a third straight game as he\u2019s projected to miss three more games with his right ankle injury. The 3-pointer could decide this one as Dallas is 18-3 when they make 16 or more 3s, but Indiana ranks 6th in opponent 3-point percentage . 2. Sixers face a key road test Philadelphia has designs on being one of the top teams in the East this season. However, it has lost two straight and three of its last five games overall, with the last two losses both coming in road blowouts. A visit to Miami ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ) would hardly seem like the salve for what ails the Sixers these days, especially since they are 1-2 in the season series to date. Scoring has been a big problem for the Sixers since we entered 2020: Since Jan. 1 , they are averaging 105.5 ppg (27th in NBA), 101 ppg on the road (30th) and are 27th in Offensive Rating (106.3). 3. Make-or-break time for Spurs? The annual rodeo road trip is underway for San Antonio as it visits the LA Clippers ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) to start an eight-game road swing that will last more than two weeks. There have been signs of playoff life for the Spurs of late thanks to a 5-5 record over their last 10 games (which includes wins against the Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Miami Heat). San Antonio is just 1 1\/2 games behind No. 8 Memphis and a win tonight would go a long way in helping the Spurs\u2019 push for a 23rd straight playoff appearance. 4.

The Brooklyn Nets star had an MRI exam Sunday that confirmed the team\u2019s diagnosis after he was injured Saturday in Washington. Irving got hurt in the fourth quarter of a 113-107 loss , when he and Wizards guard Bradley Beal got tangled battling for a loose ball and Irving\u2019s knee twisted as he landed on the court. He stayed down for a couple minutes before remaining in the game for the jump ball \u2014 in which he didn\u2019t jump \u2014 and then left the court and went to the locker room. Irving had his highest-scoring game of the season the previous night, scoring 54 points in a victory over Chicago. The Nets said Irving will be reevaluated in a week.

In fact, very, very few NBA players ever have. The Portland Trail Blazers star continued his scorching scoring run Saturday with yet another masterpiece, lighting up the Utah Jazz for 51 points. It marked his fourth 50-point game of the season, which is impressive enough. But three of those have come in the past six contests, a jaw-dropping stretch also featuring 48-, 47- and 36-point outings. Lillard is averaging 48.8 points over those six games, one of the most prodigious scoring spans in recent NBA history. But wait, there\u2019s more! Lillard has 49 3-pointers during his streak, the most of any six-game stretch in NBA history. And he\u2019s not just gunning, either. With 12 assists against the Jazz, Lillard is also averaging 10.2 assists, making him the first player in league annals to average at least 45 points and 10 assists over six games. And the cherry on top: Lillard has been hyper-efficient, shooting 54.8 percent overall, 57 percent on 3-pointers and 92.3 percent from the foul line. Remarkable stuff, to say the least. Next up? Against the Nuggets on Tuesday, against whom Lillard has scored 32 and 13 in two previous meetings, with the latter tied for his third-lowest output of the season. The way he\u2019s going, however, that would be an average quarter.

The first commanding voice heard over the loudspeaker was the baritone belonging to Lawrence Tanter, so smooth and regal for four decades as the public address announcer for the Lakers, suddenly so static for a brief and detectable moment while he welcomed a sellout crowd and weaved through the pregame ceremony. The second came from LeBron James, who tossed aside a handwritten statement on a sheet of paper, explaining that instead of \u201cselling y\u2019all (short), I\u2019ll go straight to the heart.\u201d Then he needed a few deep breaths to make it through his impromptu address about what Kobe meant to him, the Lakers and basketball. In between those sounds came others that struck the right tenor for a long-awaited and much-needed night of remembrance. Usher, the soul singer, gave a rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d that belonged on a Sunday morning, his pitch turning honey as highlights of Bryant being celebrated by dozens of teams and athletes from multiple sports and countries played overhead. The arena turned dark for that, peppered only by tiny lights from thousands of cell phone cameras. And then with Ben Hong of the Los Angeles Philharmonic playing cello, more Kobe highlights, complete with his words about his philosophy on life, hard work, family and the sport he lived and sweat for and loved. So moving, so rich. For the next 10 minutes it was Kobe on autoplay, in his own words, bouncing through his basketball journey starting as a teenager in high school who couldn\u2019t believe his luck when the Lakers swung a draft-day trade for him. Then there was Kobe, with miniature \u2018fro and perky personality, elevating his way to stardom, the arms of Shaquille O\u2019Neal and a string of championships. Also the twilight Kobe, wincing from a torn Achilles, pushing through rehab and finishing with a 60-point exclamation point in his final game. Lastly, the father Kobe, doting on his four daughters and teaching the finer points of the game to the one who embraced basketball, Gigi. These were some snippets of his message that brought sniffles and chants of \u201cMVP\u201d and \u201cKobe\u201d: \u201cI wanted to be the best basketball player I could and anything that was outside of that lane I didn\u2019t have time for.\u201d And: \u201cPay everything you learned forward.\u201d And: \u201cI love you guys, or can I say, \u2018Mamba out.\u2019\u201d Well. You expected this and so you got this just before tipoff of the Lakers\u2019 first action since the death of Bryant and eight others, including Gigi. There is no guidebook for moments such as these, when emotions and tragedy make for a turbulent mix, and you ask: What is appropriate? What is tasteful? What is right? This was not a basketball game anyone came to see; this was a shared reflection everyone wanted to feel. Here on the final and longest and most moving of the Kobe memorials around the NBA over the past five days, everyone saw how the devotion to Kobe naturally runs deepest in L.A., where he won five titles but mostly made people happy while doing it. \u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel. \u201cGuys teared up going into the jump ball. You just felt it the whole night.\u201d The player he was for 20 years and the passionate father he was until the minute the helicopter crashed Sunday in the Calabasas hills is what resonated with so many and why Staples had the mood of a mass therapy session and fully embraced it. \u201cThis week has been about life more than basketball,\u201d said Vogel. Both before and during the ceremony, thousands of fans gathered in the streets outside Staples, unable to get in but anxious to share the sentiment. The crowds actually began gathering Friday morning around 9. By noon, there was a swell, and the makeshift memorials that peppered the sidewalks around Staples and the courtyard at LA Live across the street had multiplied. Arena officials said these will not go to waste. Instead: The basketballs and large boards featuring handwritten signs will be boxed and sent to Bryant\u2019s family, upon their request. The flowers will be turned to mulch and used to fertilize plants around the arena. The candles will be donated to shelters. But inside: Everyone was given a shirt with 8 on one side, 24 on the other. With Gigi\u2019s travel teammates watching from nearby seats, two chairs remained unoccupied by design. They were draped with jerseys, a No. 24 for Bryant, No. 2 for Gigi; father and daughter sat on those seats in December to watch the Lakers play the Mavericks because she was a Luka Doncic fan. It was the last NBA game they saw together. The players were inspired by that, and Anthony Davis said: \u201cFor me, it was about playing as hard as I could knowing that\u2019s what he would want me to do. Try my best to make him proud.\u201d Frank Vogel and the coaching staff wore Kobe sneakers. The players warmed up in Kobe T-shirts and then Kobe jerseys for the starting lineup introductions, which were anything but routine. Tanter spoke, this time without a hitch, with each guard and forward and center position sounding concise and the same: \u201c6-6, 20th campaign from Lower Merion High School, Ko-bee Bryant.\u201d More? Of course more. As the Lakers walked from the bench to the scorer\u2019s table to check in, they bypassed a freshly-painted No. 8 on the court, while the Blazers walked over a 24. There was a 24.2-second moment of silence, the 24 for Kobe, the 2 for his daughter. Also, a 24-second violation to start the game, followed by an eight-second backcourt violation. As the night deepened, a single spotlight stayed transfixed on the only visible retired jerseys hanging in the rafters, and your first guess which ones is correct. The Lakers played through their emotions in their first action in six days after flying from Philadelphia last Saturday and checking their cell phones in shock. They also dribbled and shot through particles of chalk, tossed in the air by LeBron, who never pointed skyward after tossing until this one time. He was silent since the crash, choosing to save his first words for Friday. In his pregame speech he got straight to what matters: \u201cIt\u2019s all about family,\u201d he said. \u201cBest thing you can do is lean on the shoulders of your family. This is really truly, truly, a family \u2026 I look at this as a celebration tonight. Tonight we celebrate the kid that came here at 18 and retired at 38. Kobe is a brother to me. All the battles we had in my career, the one thing we shared is the determination we had to want to win \u2026 I want to continue his legacy, not only this year but for how long we play the game of basketball because that\u2019s what we love.\u201d There was a basketball game wrapped inside a tribute. It was Portland\u2019s third game since Kobe\u2019s death. The Blazers, looser and less burdened, won 127-119 for those interested. The real finish was provided hours before the buzzer by LeBron in his tribute. He played the role of closer, much like Kobe had, by quoting Kobe\u2019s final game sign-off with a twist: \u201cIn the words of Kobe Bryant, \u2018Mamba Out,\u2019 but in the words of us, \u2018not forgotten.\u2019 Live on, brother.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The trade deadline is just six days away and All-Star 2020 won\u2019t be long after that. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 15 weekend \u2026 James Harden is probably happy to turn his 2020 calendar to February. With one January game left to play ( vs. Dallas, 7:30 ET on ESPN ), Harden has an effective field goal percentage of 41.7% this month. That\u2019s the seventh-worst mark among 164 players with at least 100 January field goal attempts, and the second-worst mark for any month in Harden\u2019s career in which he attempted at least 100 shots. With Russell Westbrook having his most efficient month of the season , the Rockets\u2019 offense hasn\u2019t taken a huge hit. They scored 110.7 points per 100 possessions in January, down from 114.0 through Dec. 31. But with league-average efficiency having climbed, that January mark ranks 16th in the league . And the Rockets haven\u2019t been good enough defensively to win games when they aren\u2019t scoring a a top-five level. A 6-7 record this month has taken them from fourth to sixth place in the West. Harden\u2019s struggles have been about more than his 3-point shooting ( 38.3% through Dec. 31 , 25.2% in January ). He has also shot much worse in the paint ( 45.8% ) than he did through December (55.8%). His shot distribution for January has been a little heavier on paint shots (46% of his total field goal attempts) than it was prior (43%). Harden could be a little banged up. He missed a game in late December with a sprained toe and missed games on Sunday and Monday with a thigh contusion. In his return on Wednesday, he shot 5-for-18, with more turnovers (six) than assists (four), in a loss in Portland. Fatigue could also be a factor. Harden leads the league in minutes per game (37.1) and ranks second in usage rate (36.3%). Two of his three lowest scoring games of the season (17 and 13 points) were in the second game of back-to-backs this month. As has been the case in previous seasons, Harden\u2019s effective field goal percentage is lowest (and lowest compared to league average) in the fourth quarter . In each of the last two seasons, Harden\u2019s worst shooting month has been March. He\u2019s had his ups and downs, but they haven\u2019t followed any particular pattern. The All-Star break doesn\u2019t necessarily provide the solution, either. Over the last three seasons, he has a lower effective field goal percentage in February games after the break (49.1%) than he does in February games before the break (55.5%). The Rockets have seven more games before Harden and Westbrook head to Chicago for All-Star 2020. Five of those seven (including their game against the Mavs on Friday, which is for fifth place in the West) are at home, where Harden has a lower effective field goal percentage ( 52.4% ) than he does on the road (54.2%). The Philadelphia 76ers lost to the 15th-place Atlanta Hawks on Thursday. Check that. The Road Sixers lost to the Hawks on Thursday. The Home Sixers are 22-2 (.917), having outscored their opponents by 10.0 points per 100 possessions. They have wins over eight of the league\u2019s top nine teams, with the Clippers having yet to make their visit to Philly. The Road Sixers are 9-16 (.360), having been outscored by 3.1 per 100. They have losses to the Suns, Magic (twice), Wizards, Nets and Hawks. Those two differentials (winning percentage and point differential per 100 possessions) are both the biggest in the league. Last season, the Sixers had the league\u2019s sixth-biggest home-road differential in regard to winning percentage and its third-biggest home-road differential in regard to point differential per 100 possessions ( 10.2 ). So this isn\u2019t something new (and maybe the deafening sound system at the Wells Fargo Center is a factor \u2014 bring ear plugs when you go). It\u2019s just more dramatic. The Sixers\u2019 home-road differential on offense (5.8 points per 100 possessions) is the third biggest. Their home-road differential on defense (7.3 per 100) is the biggest. In Philly, the Sixers have allowed 101.4 points per 100 possessions, the best mark for any team at home . Outside of Philly, they\u2019ve allowed 108.7, the eighth-best road mark . That\u2019s not terrible, but with the league\u2019s 20th-ranked , they need to be elite defensively wherever they play. The difference in their defensive numbers has largely been about their opponents\u2019 3-point shooting ( 33.4% vs. 37.0% ). But their ability (or inability) to keep their opponents off the free-throw line has also been an issue. At home, their opponents have a free throw rate of 24.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field ( 15th among home teams ). On the road, it\u2019s 31.9 free throw attempts per 100 shots from the field, 30th among road teams . The points-allowed-per-100-possessions differential is about the same with Joel Embiid on the floor ( 96.4 per 100 at home , 103.7 on the road ) as it is with Embiid off the floor (102.6, 109.6). The Sixers allowed the Hawks\u2019 27th-ranked offense to score 90 points on 78 possessions with Embiid on the floor on Thursday. On average, the Sixers have played tougher opponents and stronger offenses at home. And the rest of their four-game trip promises to be much tougher than their game in Atlanta. They visit the Celtics ( sixth in offensive efficiency ) on Saturday ( 8:30 ET, ABC ), the Heat (eighth) on Monday ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ), and the Bucks (second) on Thursday ( 8 ET, TNT ). Two of those teams are potential first-round opponents. And if the Sixers can\u2019t figure out their road issues, they will be starting the first round \u2026 on the road. Thus far, they\u2019re 7-6 in games played between the top six teams in the East, 6-1 at home and 1-5 on the road. The road win was Dec. 12 in Boston .  The Denver Nuggets beat the Utah Jazz on Thursday after trailing by as many as 11 points in the second quarter . The win tied the Nuggets with the Toronto Raptors for the most wins (12) after trailing by double-digits this season. Both the Nuggets (12-11) and Raptors (12-10) have winning records in games they\u2019ve trailed by 10 points or more. They\u2019re not the only ones. The Los Angeles Lakers (10-8) and Milwaukee Bucks (6-5) have also won more than half of the games they\u2019ve trailed by double-digits. It was written in this space that comebacks from double-digit deficits are a little more common this season than they have been in the past. Through Thursday, teams have won 25% of the games they\u2019ve trailed by 10 points or more, up from 23% last season. The Bucks, Lakers, Raptors and Nuggets have four of the five best records in the league . But four teams with winning records after trailing by double-digits is still pretty wild. Over the previous 10 seasons, only six teams total had winning records after trailing by 10 points or more \u2026 What\u2019s even crazier is that this is the fourth time in the last five seasons that the Raptors have led the league (or been tied for the league lead) in wins after trailing by double-digits. Here are the most improved 3-point shooters among the 161 players with at least 100 3-point attempts in each of the last two seasons\u2026 Jrue Holiday is further down the list (43rd) from his two brothers, but has also seen an improvement (from 32.5% to 35.7%). And the Holidays aren\u2019t the only set of brothers who had some productive shooting sessions in the gym last summer. Marcus ( from 37.5% to 43.9% ) and Markieff ( from 33.5% to 39.7% ) Morris rank 12th and 13th on the list, respectively. The bottom of the list: Blake Griffin ( from 36.2% to 24.3% ), Jimmy Butler ( from 34.7% to 24.5% ) and Vince Carter ( 38.9% to 28.9% ). There will be no full February schedule breakdown on Saturday, like we had for December and January . Instead, we\u2019ll have a full, post-break schedule breakdown in the days after All-Star.

Lakers set to return to action There\u2019s little that can be said about how difficult of a week this has been on Los Angeles in general and the Lakers in particular. The team gets back to work tonight, though, as it hosts the Portland Trail Blazers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) in what is sure to be a highly emotional game in the wake of Kobe Bryant\u2019s recent death . LeBron James and Anthony Davis haven\u2019t said much about how this has all affected them (although they did recently get new tattoos in memory of Bryant), but perhaps they will speak up tonight. The team plans to honor Kobe in a pregame ceremony that, to be sure, may be the most moving one yet. 2. No Luka in Mavs-Rockets showdown Dallas star guard Luka Doncic won\u2019t be suiting up tonight after suffering a right ankle sprain near the end of Thursday\u2019s practice. That takes some of the shine off a key Southwest Division showdown ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ), a series that Dallas already leads 1-0. If you haven\u2019t been paying attention, Rockets guard Russell Westbrook is on fire this month (33.1 ppg, 8.3 apg, 4.9 rpg) \u2026 but Houston is just 4-6 in his 10 games. In the last Mavs-Rockets game, Westbrook was checked most by Tim Hardaway (2 minutes, 33 seconds) and Delon Wright (2:05), so they\u2019ll probably have that task again tonight. 3. Powerhouses meet in Milwaukee Denver got a big win last night and a bit of a leg up in the Northwest Division chase in holding off visiting Utah . The road doesn\u2019t get any easier for the Nuggets, though, as they visit the NBA\u2019s No. 1 team (record-wise) next ( 9 ET, League Pass ) in what should be a must-watch matchup. The Bucks have won nine in a row and are seeking their second win streak of 10 or more games this season. Denver has plenty of dependable wing defenders and one of them must keep Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton under wraps. He\u2019s fresh off a 51-point game and is averaging 26.4 ppg over the last two weeks. 4. The ones who were snubbed \u2026 The Raptors, Thunder and Pelicans might want to be careful tonight. They all take on teams who have a player who, rightfully or wrongfully, was not an All-Star reserve selection in 2020. The Pistons host the Raptors ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) and may get a very inspired performance from the NBA\u2019s leading rebounder (Andre Drummond) as he was not on the East reserves. Out West, the Pelicans host the Grizzlies ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and their electric (non-All-Star) rookie guard, Ja Morant . As for the Thunder, they have perhaps the most unenviable task. OKC is visiting Phoenix ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and the player many feel was most snubbed as an All-Star reserve: shooting guard Devin Booker . There\u2019s a very good chance he comes out looking to make a big statement tonight. 5. On this date: Harden\u2019s epic 60-pointer The kind of scoring exploits James Harden gets into on the regular these days have become almost passe. Back on Jan. 31, 2018, though, he did something that had never been accomplished in NBA history. Harden logged the first 60-point triple-double in NBA history, finishing with 60 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists, four steals and a block in a 114-107 win against the Orlando Magic. Additionally, Harden set the Rockets\u2019 franchise record for points in a game, besting Calvin Murphy\u2019s 57-point mark set on March 18, 1978.

Or is it? The Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 All-Star point guard and Western Conference Player of the Week is playing at a galactic level these days as he tries to help his team close the gap in the Western Conference playoff chase. He collected his first triple-double in Wednesday\u2019s win over Houston and has spent the better part of the past month reminding the world why he\u2019s one of the game\u2019s elite players. Over his past 10 games , Lillard is averaging a jaw-dropping 36.3 points on 49.8% shooting (and 45.3% on 3-pointers) as well as 8.4 assists and 5.0 rebounds for a team with no time to spare as the West playoff chase cranks up. Lillard\u2019s relatively late push in the MVP race comes as it remains static at the top in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Does that make it too late for Lillard (or anyone else) to shake things up? Time, of course, will tell. If Lillard can sustain his torrid pace and the Blazers close the gap on the Memphis Grizzlies and San Antonio Spurs, anything \u2014 as Kevin Garnett famously once said \u2014 is possible. A primetime showdown Friday night against LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) provides the perfect platform for a statement win. In his past four games, Lillard is averaging 48.5 ppg, 9.8 apg, 8.0 rpg while shooting 53.2% overall, 55.9% on 3-pointers and 91.8% on free throws. If triple-double-type numbers are what\u2019s needed to keep pace, Lillard is more than willing to oblige for his team\u2019s sake. \u201c It \u2019 s about time. It took eight years,\u201d a reportedly smiling Lillard told reporters after nabbing that first triple-double. \u201cI think there \u2019 s been plenty of times where I could have just kind of hunted it \u2014 I \u2019 ve been two rebounds or one assist away, but it \u2019 s just something about I never wanted to go out there and just chase it. I \u2019 m just happy that it came in a win, and that it was a performance where it was needed.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  30.0 Points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.1 steals, 1.0 block With his supporting cast, led by All-Star forward Khris Middleton crushing it for a career-high 51 points , Antetokounmpo rested his sore shoulder as the Bucks won their ninth straight game. It was a shrewd bit of time management by the Bucks to give him the breather, especially with seven games (starting with tonight\u2019s visit from Denver) on the schedule before All-Star weekend. Even the relentless \u201cGreek Freak\u201d needs a break every now and then. Last week: No. 2 Season stats:  25.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 10.7 assists, 1.3 steals LeBron\u2019s leadership skills will be tested mightily as the Lakers continue to process the loss of Kobe Bryant , his daughter Gianna and the seven others lost in Sunday\u2019s helicopter crash. He\u2019s already made clear that Kobe\u2019s legacy now becomes his responsibility. LeBron and the Lakers finally get back on the court Friday night in what is sure to be an emotional game against Lillard and the surging Blazers. Last week: No. 3 Season stats:  27.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.0 steals Leonard was a late scratch for the Clippers\u2019 game against Sacramento Thursday night after his back locked up on him during warmups. It\u2019s not yet clear how significant an issue it will be for the reigning Finals MVP, and given his injury management protocol, it won\u2019t shock anyone if the Clippers are extremely cautious with Leonard in the lead up to All-Star weekend. Last week: No. 4 Season stats:  28.8 points, 9.5 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.0 steals Yet another member of the top five dealing with an injury issue, Doncic sprained his right ankle in practice and will miss Friday night\u2019s game in Houston ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ). It\u2019s the same right ankle he sprained last month, which caused him to miss four games. This is a critical stretch for the Mavericks, who are locked in a tussle with the Rockets and Thunder for fifth in the West playoff chase. Last week: No. 5 Season stats:  20.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.8 steals Butler and the Heat couldn\u2019t keep pace with Boston Thursday night, dropping just their third game of the season at home. In Miami, though, Butler and his freshly minted All-Star teammate, Bam Adebayo, have helped the Heat soar at home (where they are 24-3). Oddly enough, Butler\u2019s numbers are slightly better away from home. * * * * * * 6. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers 7. James Harden, Houston Rockets 8. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 9.

The Lakers host the Portland Trail Blazers tonight ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) in what promises to be a highly emotional game as it is the Lakers\u2019 first game \u2014 and first home game \u2014 since Bryant\u2019s passing. Lakers stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis took part in the team\u2019s practice on Thursday at an outdoor field across the street from the team\u2019s El Segundo practice facility. As part of that practice, the team played a game of pickup football for about 10 minutes and both James and Davis were sporting new tattoos on their bodies that paid tribute to Bryant, per ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin . https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/nessaurelia\/ California-based tattoo artist Vanessa Aurelia shared a video on her Instagram story Thursday that showed her work on James\u2019 left thigh and Davis\u2019 right thigh. James posted a picture of the completed work on his Instagram.  http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/antdavis23\/?hl Davis also shared a video of his procedure, writing \u201cUntil next time! Thanks for having me.\u201d Save for comments on social media, neither Davis nor James have addressed the media regarding Bryant\u2019s death since it took place on Sunday. Lakers coach Frank Vogel has spoken to the media the past two days and said Thursday that the lives of Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Gigi, and the seven others will be remembered in some manner before Friday\u2019s tipoff. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, and it will be an important night for our franchise and Laker nation,\u201d he said before adding he is \u201cgoing to let it all play out.\u201d The Lakers have now posted four oversized boards outside their practice facility in El Segundo which are used for fans to write messages or simply sign. Jeanie Buss, the controlling owner of the Lakers, posted a message on social media Thursday saying Bryant was highly regarded by Jerry Buss, the late owner of the Lakers, and the entire Buss family. Lakers vice president Rob Pelinka, who once was Bryant\u2019s agent and also his close friend, also broke his silence with a Thursday statement that spoke of how he had lost his \u201cbest friend\u201d in Bryant and \u201cmy sweet goddaughter\u201d in Gigi. Bryant\u2019s death has temporarily overwhelmed an exciting season of rebirth for the Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for a franchise-record six straight years. The current Lakers are poised for a serious run at the franchise\u2019s 17th championship, with James and Davis leading a burgeoning powerhouse to the Western Conference\u2019s best record at 36-10.

A quick introduction brokered by Detroit Pistons Senior Director of Public Relations Cletus Lewis at a Saturday morning shootaround. \u201cSekou (Doumbouya), I\u2019d like for you to meet Sekou (Smith),\u201d Lewis said to the 19-year-old rookie from France who didn\u2019t process what was being said. \u201cSekou?\u201d he said, wide-eyed. \u201cYour name is Sekou?\u201d Absolutely, I told him. \u201cMy name has been Sekou a lot longer than yours,\u201d I joked as we both laughed as word spread around the court, leading to Doumbouya\u2019s teammates getting in on the fun. \u201cIt\u2019s Sekou and Sekou,\u201d Pistons forward Christian Wood said, \u201cit\u2019s like [hip-hop artists Lil] Baby and [Da] Baby. This is crazy.\u201d Well, not exactly. Doumbouya is a foot taller at 6-foot-9 and 245 pounds, not to mention nearly 20 years younger. But I appreciated the pop culture reference. You\u2019ve heard that saying, \u201cit\u2019s not about the Xs and Os, it\u2019s about the Jimmys and Joes.\u201d Not when you have a first name as unique as ours. For once, it\u2019s about the Sekous \u2014 and as far as I can tell he\u2019s the first player to grace an NBA roster with the same first name as yours truly.  I\u2019d done my research early on Doumbouya. When his name popped up two years ago on a prospect list for the 2019 Draft, I was intrigued. I started lobbying immediately for him to be the No. 1 overall pick just so I could hear Commissioner Adam Silver say it, \u201cwith the first overall pick of the 2019 NBA Draft, the New Orleans Pelicans select Sekou \u2026\u201d Zion Williamson interrupted those plans, of course. But a man can dream. And who could blame me? Who hasn\u2019t grown up with wild thoughts about hearing the commissioner calling your name at the Draft? Sure, it was Sekou Oumar Doumbouya and not Sekou Kimathi-Sinclair Smith whose name was called. But one Sekou in uniform is better than none. Pistons coach Dwane Casey, who I\u2019ve known for years, didn\u2019t need any pronunciation help with his young big man\u2019s name. I\u2019ve been pestering him for years. It helps that Doumbouya has emerged recently as a factor for the Pistons since joining the team from its G League affiliate in, of all places, my hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Injuries, particularly Blake Griffin\u2019s, created an opportunity for Doumbouya to make the transition from the Grand Rapids Drive\u2019s main attraction to a regular in Casey\u2019s rotation just before Christmas. The fireworks began began immediately. But things got real a few weeks ago, when young Sekou announced himself as a certified viral sensation. Doumbouya is one of the main projects in Casey\u2019s player development program in Detroit, the same one he implemented and utilized in Toronto, where guys like Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and so many others helped the Raptors grind away to a championship last season. \u201cIn today\u2019s game, you better have a good player development program because of the age of these young guys like Sekou, who are coming into the league as teenagers from around the globe,\u201d Casey said. \u201cBefore, you could get four-year college guys if you wanted to and now you\u2019re getting guys who are just turning 19.\u201d Doumbouya\u2019s time with the Drive was invaluable. He was allowed to ease his way into his NBA career, 157 miles west of Little Caesars Arena. \u201cIt was great in Grand Rapids, I do like five or six months there and I get comfortable and just focus on basketball,\u201d Doumbouya said in his still-a-bit-choppy English. \u201cIt reminded me of where I\u2019m from in France, a little bit cold, not too much movement, but nice. So I [was] comfortable.\u201d He didn\u2019t need long to make the adjustment. A graceful athlete, soccer was his first sport, with a rugged body that almost seems too big for the baby-faced Doumbouya, the physicality in the G League and NBA is to his liking. \u201cThat\u2019s really when I started to get my confidence back,\u201d he said of the G League. It\u2019s life off the court that has required the biggest adjustment. The constant travel involved in an NBA season \u2014 different cities at all hours of the day and night, seen mostly from buses to and from airports, hotels and arenas \u2014 can be a whirlwind for anyone, but especially a teenager in a foreign land. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn, especially for a rookie,\u201d Doumbouya said. \u201cYou gotta take care of yourself, take care of your body and still keep up. It\u2019s a lot.\u201d Doumbouya hasn\u2019t hesitated to lean on his teammates and the network of players around the league he already knew, including Siakam as well as members of the French National Team, for advice on how to navigate the opening stages of his journey. \u201cI know Siakam and we talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just told me to \u2018be patient, stay patient. You know what you are doing. Do your work and be ready when your chance comes.\u2019 And I was ready\u2026 I knew when I got the call up I had to be ready to work.\u201d Casey said the G League stint was \u201chuge\u201d in Doumbouya\u2019s preparation for the workload he\u2019s assumed. I reminded Doumbouya that he\u2019s just getting started, that I have Air Jordan\u2019s older than him and that he\u2019s not just representing his birth nation of Guinea and his beloved France, but also the other Sekou he\u2019d just met and any others out there like us. \u201cI got it,\u201d he said, laughing as he walked to the team bus. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got it.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He was as synonymous with Southern California as the sunshine and touched every inch of it.\u201d Bryant\u2019s retired No. 8 and 24 Lakers jerseys were left uncovered in the upper left corner of Staples Center. Following the video tribute, there was 24 seconds of silence followed by \u201cKobe, Kobe\u201d chants before the national anthem. The tribute was a preamble to the Lakers\u2019 return to Staples Center Friday night for their first game since Bryant\u2019s death. Their game Tuesday against the Clippers was postponed out of respect for the grieving franchise and city. The Clippers wore No. 24 shooting shirts during pregame warm-ups while Doc Rivers and the coaching staff wore ties and shoes honoring Bryant. Both Rivers and Kings coach Luke Walton said they had mixed emotions entering the arena. Rivers said he has received a lot of pictures from people showing him and Bryant together. \u201cEverywhere you go, you are reminded. It has been a tough week for the whole city and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Rivers said. Walton, a former Lakers player and coach, said he walked around LA Live shortly after the Kings arrived early Thursday morning. He added it was an emotional scene with people still outside grieving Bryant at 2 a.m. \u201cYou think you\u2019re doing fine and then you walk into Staples Center. It is still really hard and a lot of emotions that continue to come back,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI try to focus on what an inspiration he is to me and others, which helps.\u201d Rivers said the best way to honor Bryant\u2019s memory the rest of the season is to compete like he would. \u201cIt was already our journey and then this happens,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThey understand if you really want to salute him, he made a lot of sacrifices to be a winner and we have to do the same.\u201d"},{"id":29007,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-prepare-first-game-after-kobe","date":"2020-01-31","title":"Lakers gradually opening up as they prepare for first game following Kobe Bryant's death","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 The season resumes Friday for the Lakers following a five-day heartbreak, the franchise still numb from tragedy and searching for ways to invite normalcy. The lives of Kobe Bryant and eight others who perished in a Sunday helicopter accident , including his 13-year-old daughter, Gigi, will be remembered in some manner before tipoff, during the game and perhaps after the buzzer against the Trail Blazers on Friday ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). The team was mum on details, but coach Frank Vogel hinted plans were well into the advanced stage. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, and it will be an important night for our franchise and Laker nation,\u201d he said before adding he is \u201cgoing to let it all play out.\u201d The public outpouring for Bryant continued for another day, with more visitors staking out Staples Center downtown. Meanwhile, the Lakers have now posted four oversized boards outside their practice facility in El Segundo which are used for fans to write messages or simply sign. Obviously, the club is still struggling to come to grips with the deaths. With the exception of Vogel, prominent members of the franchise have limited their public remarks, although that thaw has now begun. Jeanie Buss, the controlling owner of the Lakers, posted a message on social media Thursday saying Bryant was highly regarded by Jerry Buss, the late owner of the Lakers, and the entire Buss family. She added: \u201cMy father loved you like a son, which makes us family. When you invited me to lunch shortly after my father passed away, I was struggling to find motivation and purpose. Kobe, you brought Gianna with you to spend some time with me. You explained that you wanted to show her that women can be leaders in the NBA, just like the men.\u201d  Kobe, I don\u2019t know how to express what you mean to me, my family and the Los Angeles Lakers. My father loved you like a son, which makes us family. When you invited me to lunch shortly after my father passed away, I was struggling to find motivation and purpose. Kobe, you brought Gianna with you to spend some time with me. You explained that you wanted to show her that women can be leaders in the NBA, just like the men. At first, it seemed like an action of a devoted father setting an example for his daughter. But in actuality \u2013 and I am positively sure you knew EXACTLY what you were doing \u2013 what you did was give me the inspiration and strength I was searching for. I reflect on that day often and it makes me smile and it makes me strong. I call on that memory whenever I feel down and need a bit of courage. For everything you did on the court that filled me with so much joy and love, for all the lives you changed through basketball itself, it was that day with Gigi that reignited my drive and determination. Vanessa, Natalia, Bianka, and Capri \u2013 I am so sorry for your loss. We are grateful to have you in our lives and we will always be here for you. To the families that also lost loved ones on Sunday, the entire Laker family mourns with you. Laker Nation \u2013 we are one family grieving the loss of people we all loved dearly. We will mourn together, cry together but we will also heal together, love together and win TOGETHER. We love you. Kobe \u2013 that\u2019s what you made you so unbelievably special. You not only inspired us towards greatness, you showed us the way. : : To learn more about how you can help the families affected by this tragedy go to MambaOnThree.org and to further Kobe and Gianna\u2019s legacy in youth sports visit MambaSportsFoundation.org #peace #love #joy #family #Mamba #Mambacita #2 #8 #24 : : Picture taken in February 2016 on the way to #NBAAllStar game in #Toronto photo credit @pinkskennedy A post shared by  Jeanie Buss (@jeaniebuss) on Jan 30, 2020 at 9:05am PST Lakers vice president Rob Pelinka, who once was Bryant\u2019s agent and also his close friend, also broke his silence with a Thursday statement that read in part: \u201cTheir lives have shown me that death has no victory. Last Sunday is not the end of the story. It\u2019s just a new beginning. Kobe and Gigi\u2019s legacies will live on \u2013 and gain even more power and influence. All of us touched by them will now try to become torch carriers of their legacies. And, while we do that, we can be certain of this: Kobe and Gigi will continue on, forever, playing a joy-filled game of basketball in heaven above.\u201d Meanwhile, the players remained media-quiet for another day after conducting their second straight practice since the news broke. Shortly before noon they walked across the street from their practice facility to a soccer field, where they spent 30 minutes stretching and throwing a football. It wasn\u2019t the first time the Lakers opened a practice session in this manner; Vogel wanted to take advantage of the 71-degree day and admitted it was therapeutic. Elsewhere in the NBA, Bryant\u2019s memory has been honored in various ways, mainly with a moment of silence before tipoff and a pair of intentional 24-second shot clock or 8-second backcourt violations to start the game. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said the club will retire Bryant\u2019s jersey . It\u2019s likely the Lakers will brief the Blazers on pregame plans and the clubs will engage in some manner of joint tribute. There\u2019s also the possibility of a tribute planned outside of Staples for fans without tickets, although again, the Lakers weren\u2019t forthcoming Thursday about any details. Also, there is no set rescheduled date for the Jan. 28 game against the Clippers that was postponed at the Lakers\u2019 request. The Lakers currently lead the Western Conference with a 36-10 record, which is also second-best in the league. LeBron James and Anthony Davis were both voted to start in February\u2019s All-Star Game, and James became the third all-time scorer in league history in L.A.\u2019s most recent game, one during which he passed Bryant while playing in the former Laker star\u2019s hometown of Philadelphia. James and Bryant shared a phone conversation shortly afterward. The following morning, tragedy struck. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

By now, he\u2019s used to being snubbed, which is exactly what transpired Thursday when the NBA All-Star reserves were announced on TNT, once again without Booker in the fold. Told he had come in at fourth for guards in the Western Conference last week in the votes submitted by the players, Booker shrugged. \u201cThat was good news,\u201d he said. Then came the bad Thursday for the guard, who is averaging 27.1 points, 6.4 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game while shooting a career-best 51% from the floor. A five-year veteran, Booker hasn\u2019t yet been named an NBA All-Star, and was somewhat of a longshot this year to be the first Suns player to make it since 2012, when Steve Nash represented the squad. Despite finishing fourth among player votes, Booker was eighth in fan voting. Lack of team success certainly factors into the equation, no matter what you might think about the selection of Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young. So now, Booker will just continue to settle for the words of admiration he receives from opponents on the floor from time to time. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard [players like my game] a lot in my years I\u2019ve been here, and that\u2019s probably one of the best compliments I can get. Guys that are in this situation, guys that are taking these flights to these different cities, spending summers working on their game, just to earn that respect from them is important to me. I\u2019m the same way. I follow the game very closely. I watch a lot of players, and I\u2019m a fan of a lot of people\u2019s game, and I respect them at a high level.\u201d Booker\u2019s All-Star snub represents only one of several we\u2019ll cover in our quick takeaways from Thursday\u2019s announcement of the 2020 NBA All-Star team reserves. Booker wasn\u2019t the only player deserving of All-Star recognition that was snubbed. The list here is pretty long. We\u2019ll go through them one by one, in no particular order: Derrick Rose deserves a Chicago homecoming for the All-Star game, considering he\u2019s on a career-long streak with 20 points or more in 13 consecutive games. DeMar DeRozan could be victim of what analytics folks consider to be an antiquated game as he doesn\u2019t shoot the 3-ball much, but he\u2019s one of just three players (East captain Giannis Antetokounmpo and West reserve Nikola Jokic are the others) averaging 20 points or more, 5 rebounds or more and 5 assists or more while shooting 50% or better. Bradley Beal is averaging career highs in points (28.6) and assists (6.3) and has scored 36 points or more in four consecutive games with a couple of 40-pieces thrown in there. How are the Wizards 2-9 this season when Beal scores more than 35 points? Andre Drummond was considered an on-the-bubble player for this year\u2019s team, but you can\u2019t ignore his league-high 15.6 rpg, not to mention the two-time All-Star is averaging 17.2 ppg, which is just short of the career-high 17.3 ppg he averaged last year. Kyrie Irving and Paul George belong in the same entry as big names that didn\u2019t make this year\u2019s All-Star team. In a sense, they\u2019re snubs, given their ability, and what we\u2019ve seen in the past from these guys. But at the same time, they missed too much time. Irving has played in just 18 games for Brooklyn this season, while George has participated in 26 games for the Clippers. Out of sight, out of mind. Zach LaVine should be in this game, and not just because it\u2019s in Chicago. He\u2019s averaging 25.1 ppg this season, and he\u2019s scored 20 points or more in 16-straight games. His high-flying ability and 3-point shooting would seem to make him a perfect match for the NBA All-Star Game. Here\u2019s hoping he makes it soon. Jaylen Brown missed the cut despite averaging 21.5 ppg, 6.9 rpg and 2.9 apg, and we\u2019ve all seen him take over games this season when needed. Perhaps three Boston Celtics on the All-Star squad would\u2019ve been too many. Duos overpower the rosters for this year\u2019s All-Star team with eight teams landing two players on the squad. West captain LeBron James represents the Los Angeles Lakers alongside Chicago native Anthony Davis , while East captain Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton head up selections for the Milwaukee Bucks. Other duos include Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry , Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons , Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo and Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker and Jayson Tatum , as well as Houston\u2019s James Harden and Russell Westbrook and Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert . Counting the starters, you\u2019ve got nine first-time All-Stars on this year\u2019s teams in Dallas guard Luka Doncic , Utah\u2019s Gobert and Mitchell and New Orleans forward Brandon Ingram for the Western Conference. Adebayo , Tatum , Young , Siakam and Indiana forward Domantas Sabonis have those honors in the Eastern Conference. With Doncic just 20 years old, and Young only 21, this marks the second time an NBA All-Star game includes multiple starters aged 21 and under. In 1998, Kobe Bryant (19) and Kevin Garnet (21) played in the league\u2019s annual showcase. Before that, the last time more than one second-year player started in the same All-Star Game was 1996, with Grant Hill and Jason Kidd. Doncic and Young are both second-year players. A former Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert is surprisingly a first-time All-Star as he\u2019s averaging 14.6 rpg, the fifth-consecutive season he\u2019s averaged 10 rebounds or more. Jazz teammate Mitchell won the 2018 Verizon Slam Dunk Contest but had never made an All-Star Game before now. In just his third year, Mitchell is averaging career highs in points (25.0), rebounds (4.2) and assists (4.2). * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The fans, media and players who voted for the starters made sure of it last week. The coaches did the same tonight with their selections for the 14 reserves who will fill out the rosters, adding six additional first-time All-Stars to the mix. Miami forward Bam Adebayo , Indiana forward Domantas Sabonis and Boston forward Jayson Tatum join Young and Siakam on the Eastern Conference list, while Utah center Rudy Gobert , Utah guard Donovan Mitchell and New Orleans forward Brandon Ingram join Doncic as first-timers on the Western Conference list. Adebyao\u2019s Miami teammate, Jimmy Butler , heads the list of Eastern Conference reserves, which also includes Ben Simmons (Philadelphia), Kyle Lowry (Toronto) and Khris Middleton (Milwaukee). Nikola Jokic (Denver), Damian Lillard (Portland), Chris Paul (Oklahoma City) and two-time Kia NBA All-Star Game MVP Russell Westbrook (Houston) fill out the Western Conference list. Adebayo became a full-time starter this season and has been a stalwart alongside Butler, who is in his first season with the Heat. Miami is one of the surprise teams in the league this season. Sabonis, in his fourth season, has been the backbone of an Indiana team that played the first 47 games of schedule without inured All-Star guard Victor Oladipo. Tatum, in his third season, has gotten back to the two-way rhythm he showed during the playoffs of his rookie season, when he first flashed his All-Star potential. Gobert, the reigning and back-to-back Kia Defensive Player of the Year, is finally a part of the All-Star team in his seventh season, joining Mitchell, the Jazz\u2019s leading scorer, who makes the team in his third season. Ingram leads the Pelicans in scoring and has been the best player on a team that was supposed to be headlined by rookie sensation Zion Williamson, whose season was delayed by 45 games due to knee surgery. For the second-straight season, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James was the top vote-getter in the Western Conference. Anthony Davis (Lakers), Kawhi Leonard (Clippers), James Harden (Houston) and Doncic round out the starting five. Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo was the top vote-getter in the Eastern Conference. He\u2019s the headliner of a first five that includes Kemba Walker (Boston), Young (Atlanta), Siakam (Toronto) and Joel Embiid (Philadelphia). Fans accounted for 50 percent of the vote to determine the NBA All-Star Game starters, while current NBA players and a media panel accounted for 25 percent each. James (6,275,459 fan votes) and Antetokounmpo (5,902,286 fan votes) led their respective conferences and position groups in fan voting. Don\u010di\u0107 (6,111,735 fan votes) and Young (2,829,969 fan votes) also topped their respective position groups in fan voting. As captains, James and Antetokounmpo will get to shape their own teams for the Feb. 16 game, choosing from a player pool that includes the other eight starters and the 14 reserves, regardless of conference designation.

With that, there has been an amputation of part of my soul. Kobe was a force of nature, deep and obsessed with excellence. He was wise, determined, passionate. A visionary beyond measure. A dedicated and loving husband, and a \u201cgirl-dad\u201d like no other. When he walked into a room, the energy ignited. He was high voltage, with a motor that had no limits. His mind had an infinite capacity to learn. He was, simply put, the most inspirational athlete of our time. What the world may not know, is that he was also the best friend anyone could ever imagine. Gigi was pure joy. Her smile brought comfort to any and every occasion. She was brilliant, kind and warm. And, like her dad, when she stepped onto the basketball court, she took on an entirely different nature, and boy could she play. Her basketball destiny was apparent, and the world knew it. She was also an extraordinary, loyal and supportive sister, and a wonderful friend to my children. My son and daughter always left time with Gigi feeling better about life itself. Everything Gigi stood for, I am so proud of. Maya Angelou once wrote \u201cwhen great trees fall \u2026 lions hunker down in tall grasses.\u201d What I am daily learning is that after the tragic loss of these nine souls, life on this side of eternity will never be the same. For any of us who knew them, there is an irreplaceable void left behind. But I am also finding that there is a hope. For now, each new step for me will be full of deep love and prayers, as a heavy sorrow for Vanessa, Natalia, Bianka, and Capri, and all the families involved, is slowly redeemed into something healed and new. I am coming to realize that nothing can separate any of us from the love and inspiration we\u2019ve received from Kobe and Gianna, nothing at all. Their lives have shown me that death has no victory. Last Sunday is not the end of the story. It\u2019s just a new beginning. Kobe and Gigi\u2019s legacies will live on \u2013 and gain even more power and influence. All of us touched by them will now try to become torch carriers of their legacies.

The team is still grieving and mourning Bryant\u2019s death Sunday in a helicopter crash along with his daughter, Gianna, and seven others. In her post on Instagram, Buss spoke of how Bryant served to inspire her shortly after the death of her father, Dr. Jerry Buss, in 2013 . \u201cKobe, I don\u2019t know how to express what you mean to me, my family and the Los Angeles Lakers\u201d Jeanie Buss wrote in her post. \u201cMy father loved you like a son, which makes us family.

Shortly thereafter, Magic Johnson took on Jim Buss\u2019 role while Rob Pelinka was named general manager. In her social media post, Buss says that meeting with Bryant years ago had a strong impact on her. She also spoke of how the Lakers will stand by Bryant\u2019s wife, Vanessa, and her other three daughters in the wake of the tragedy. \u201cI reflect on that day often and it makes me smile and it makes me strong,\u201d Jeanis Buss wrote. \u201cI call on that memory whenever I feel down and need a bit of courage.

Laker Nation \u2014 we are one family grieving the loss of people we all loved dearly. We will mourn together, cry together but we will also heal together, love together and win TOGETHER. We love you.\u201d Her post comes a day after the Lakers issued a statement on social media about Bryant\u2019s passing. In it, the Lakers said: \u201cWe are devastated and have been forever changed by the sudden loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna. We send our love to Vanessa, the Bryant family, and to the families of the other passengers. \u201cWords cannot express what Kobe means to the Los Angeles Lakers, our fans, and our city. More than a basketball player, he was a beloved father, husband, and teammate. Their love and light will remain in our hearts forever.\u201d Additionally, the Lakers said Bryant\u2019s Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the \u201cMambaOnThree\u201d Fund to support the families affected by this tragedy. Bryant\u2019s former Lakers teammate, Pau Gasol, took to Twitter on Thursday as well to offer up condolences to Bryant\u2019s family and the other victims of the helicopter crash. In his tweets, he wrote the following : \u201cI still refuse to believe it\u2026 it still feels like a nightmare that I can\u2019t wait to wake up from\u2026 but if this nightmare continues, I will do what I can to keep your legacy going and your lessons present in everything I do. \u201cI will be heartbroken for a long time, but I will forever be thankful for having had shared so much together.

The current Lakers are still grappling with the loss while they prepare for their next game Friday night at Staples Center against Portland ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). \u201cWe\u2019ve become a family in a very short time,\u201d Vogel said of the Lakers\u2019 roster, which features only one player who suited up with Bryant. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we talk about in the NBA with your teams, but this group in particular has really grown to love each other very rapidly, and we understand the importance and the opportunity we have this year. This has just brought us closer together.\u201d Outside the Lakers\u2019 training complex, a temporary wall of remembrance has grown to nearly the entire length of the building, bookended on either side by large photos and colorful memorials to the Bryants. Fans have streamed through the security gates and up to the wall throughout the past three days, using markers to inscribe their thoughts and prayers on the white surface. Bryant\u2019s death has temporarily overwhelmed an exciting season of rebirth for the Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for a franchise-record six straight years. The current Lakers are poised for a serious run at the franchise\u2019s 17th championship, with James and Davis leading a burgeoning powerhouse to the Western Conference\u2019s best record at 36-10. But life and basketball have been put in a new perspective for everyone around the Lakers. After their game against the Clippers on Tuesday night was postponed, the players and coaches gathered that afternoon to share stories and remembrances because it felt \u201ctherapeutic and beneficial,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that has touched my family, being the father of daughters, and it\u2019s been very emotional,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that brings us together. I\u2019m around the people who were closest to Kobe throughout his time here, and it\u2019s been just a deeply saddening time for all of us.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":29054,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2020-all-star-game-format-official-release","date":"2020-01-30","title":"New NBA All-Star Game format makes every quarter count for Chicago charities","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA announced today a new format for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game designed to increase the level of competition throughout the game, provide additional excitement at the finish and make the outcome of every quarter count for charity. The changes include a new fourth-quarter format that will honor the late Kobe Bryant, who earned 18 NBA All-Star selections and a record-tying four NBA All-Star Game MVP awards. Additional plans to honor Bryant during NBA All-Star 2020 in Chicago will be announced at a later date.  In the 69th NBA All-Star Game , Team Giannis and Team LeBron will compete to win each of the first three quarters, all of which will start with the score of 0-0 and will be 12 minutes long. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the game clock will be turned off and a Final Target Score will be set. The Final Target Score will be determined by taking the leading team\u2019s total cumulative score through three quarters and adding 24 points \u2013 the 24 representing Bryant\u2019s jersey number for the final 10 seasons of his NBA career. The teams will then play an untimed fourth quarter and the first team to reach the Final Target Score will win the NBA All-Star Game. For instance, if the cumulative score of the first three quarters is 100-95, the Final Target Score would be set at 124 points. To win the NBA All-Star Game, the team with 100 points would need to score 24 points in the fourth quarter before the team with 95 points scores 29 points, and vice versa. With no minimum or maximum time on the clock in the fourth quarter, the NBA All-Star Game will end with a made basket or a made free throw.   As part of NBA All-Star 2020, more than $1 million will be contributed to Chicago community non-profit organizations through NBA Cares outreach efforts. These efforts will culminate during the NBA All-Star Game when each team will play for a Chicago-based charity beneficiary, as selected by team captains Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers. The community organization selected by the winner of each of the first three quarters will receive $100,000 \u2013 a total of $300,000 donated to charity for those three quarters. The winner of each of the first three quarters will be the team with the higher score at the end of the 12-minute quarter.  The winning team in the NBA All-Star Game (i.e., the team that reaches the Final Target Score first) will earn $200,000 for its community organization. If the first or second quarter ends in a tie, the $100,000 charity award for that quarter will be added to the next quarter\u2019s award. If the third quarter ends in a tie, the $100,000 charity award for that quarter will be added to the award of the team that wins the NBA All-Star Game. If one team wins each of the first three quarters and reaches the Final Target Score first, $500,000 will be donated to the winning team\u2019s charity and $100,000 will be donated to the losing team\u2019s charity. The 2020 NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 16 at the United Center in Chicago, airing live at 8 p.m. ET on TNT and ESPN Radio in the United States. The NBA All-Star Game will reach fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 40 languages."},{"id":29075,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-20-kia-rookie-ladder-jan-30","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: No letting up at the top for Ja Morant","content":" Zion Williamson is on the scene, but Ja Morant is still reminding us this is still his party. In his latest display, Morant put on a show in his first visit to Madison Square Garden, dazzling with 18 points and 10 assists in a 127-106 rout of the Knicks. Morant had several highlight-reel plays, finishing an alley-oop early in the game, throwing a circus pass after doing a 360 in the lane, and finishing a swooping layup that left fans at MSG oohing and ahhing. While his line wasn\u2019t exactly jaw-dropping (Ja-dropping?), he was incredibly efficient, finishing with a ridiculous plus-46 in the box score in just 27 minutes. \u201cI felt like everybody knows Madison Square Garden is a place to play,\u201d Morant said. \u201cJust happy to be able to go out here with my teammates and get a win.\u201d A week ago, Morant had easily the worst game of his career ( two points on 1-for-5 shooting in a loss to the Celtics), but the Grizzlies have since reeled off four straight wins to reach .500 for the first time since Dec. 31, 2018. Morant has been brilliant in that span, averaging 17.6 ppg, 8.5 apg, 1.2 spg and 53.9% shooting. His impressive rookie season will easily earn him an invitation to the 2020 NBA Rising Stars game (roster will be released Friday), which showcases the top rookie and second-year players on Feb. 14 at 9 p.m. ET . But does Morant have a shot at becoming the first rookie since Blake Griffin in 2011 to earn a reserve spot in the actual All-Star Game? Nuggets coach Mike Malone isn\u2019t ready to go that far. \u201cI think he\u2019s a hell of a player but he\u2019s not an All-Star yet, in my opinion,\u201d Malone said this week . \u201cHe\u2019s got to go through his growing pains. He\u2019s Rookie of the Year, though.\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr, however, said Morant will \u201cget real consideration\u201d for that honor .  The Western Conference is loaded, especially in the backcourt, and Morant was 10th among guards in the final fan vote update . But what he\u2019s done to help turn around the Grizzlies has certainly put him in the All-Star conversation. * * * Last week: No. 1 Some more stats from Wednesday\u2019s win in New York: Morant notched his eighth double-double of the season and also had his third turnover-free game. The only bad part of his night was the apparent lack of hot water or water pressure in the visitors\u2019 locker room for post-game showers. \u201cThis is beyond me,\u201d said Morant. \u201cI\u2019ve taken cold showers before, but at least I had water pressure.\u201d  Last week: No. 3 In three games this week, Porter averaged 13.3 ppg while hitting 52.9% of his 3-pointers. He also grabbed 7.7 rpg in 23.3 mpg and had scored in double-digits in seven straight until putting up eight points in Tuesday\u2019s loss the Grizzlies. When Porter slipped to the 14th pick in the 2018 draft, many thought the Nuggets had found the steal of the Draft \u2014 if he could stay healthy. It finally looks Denver\u2019s patience is paying off, as Porter is going to be a key asset as the Nuggets fight to get out of the loaded West. Last week: Not ranked We\u2019ve had a full week now of Zion, which is enough of a sample size to throw the No. 1 pick into the Top 5. Now remember, the Rookie Ladder takes recent play into heavy consideration, so Williamson has definitely earned this spot. In three games this week, Zion averaged 16.7 ppg and 8.7 rpg on 60.5% shooting. He even picked up his first NBA win Sunday , putting up 21 points and 11 rebounds while scoring the team\u2019s final eight points. \u201c What he\u2019s done he\u2019s just done on raw talent really,\u201d coach Alvin Gentry said \u201cHe\u2019ll get the feel of what we\u2019re trying to do, and playing in a certain amount of space and how we can give him the ball and things like that. He\u2019s going to be a welcome addition. He\u2019s going to be a guy that we can finish the game with.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Reddish got off to a slow start this season, struggling to find his shot through the first three months. But January has been a different story as the No. 10 pick has turned things around to show signs of promise. Over his last 10 games, Reddish has averaged 13.6 ppg on 44% shooting, hitting 44.9% of his 3-pointers(9-for-20 in three games this week). 5. Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat   Last week: No. 2 Nunn had climbed to No. 2 last week after after an impressive stretch that saw him average 19.8 ppg over his last four games. But Nunn has since missed three games with a sore left Achilles, knocking him down a few notches. The injury doesn\u2019t appear to be serious, and the Heat\u2019s surprising guard could return as early as Saturday, when Miami visits Orlando. Just missed the cut:  Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies Last 3 games (3-0 record): 13.0 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.7 spg, 1.0 bpg, 60.7% FG De\u2019Andre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks Last 3 games (1-2 record): 16.7 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 2.0 apg, 52.8% FG, 33.3% 3FG Terence Davis, Toronto Raptors Last 3 games (3-0 record): 9.7 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 55.6% FG, 41.7% 3FG Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Last 3 games (1-2 record): 12.7 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 34.9% FG, 21.1% 3FG Luguentz Dort, Oklahoma City Thunder Last 4 games (3-1 record): 10.8 ppg, 1.3 rpg, 1.0 spg, 57.7% FG, 64.3% 3FG * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Jan. 29 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

It\u2019s All-Star reserves night! The starters for the 2020 All-Star Game are all set (and have been for a week). But who will get the reserve nods in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference? No doubt there are plenty of ways to discuss and debate this, but come 7 p.m. ET on TNT, we\u2019ll know how it all shakes out. For the time being, take a listen to who the \u201cInside The NBA\u201d guys had tabbed as their East and West reserves. 2. Raptors rolling along in East Toronto has been in a groove of late, having won eight in a row and jetting past the Miami Heat for the No. 2 spot in the East . Based on records alone, the Raptors\u2019 road game with the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 7 ET, League Pass ) may not be on your radar. But, before you skip past this one, consider how well Toronto has been playing over the last 15 days. That\u2019s how long their win streak has been running and during that stretch, they\u2019re No. 2 in Net Rating (11.2), No. 3 in Effective Field Goal percentage (58.2%) and have seen forward Norman Powell (18.1 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 44.2 3-point percentage) step up as well. 3. Celtics\u2019 heading into easier stretch Boston improved to 2-0 against the Miami Heat after an impressive road win on Tuesday . Other than a Saturday showdown with the Philadelphia 76ers, the Celtics have a run of fairly easy games coming along. The first of which is tonight as the Golden State Warriors visit ( 8 ET, TNT ), who \u2014 if you haven\u2019t been paying attention \u2014 are the West\u2019s worst team. Five of Boston\u2019s next six games are against teams under .500 (Jan. 30 vs. Golden State, Feb. 3 in Atlanta, Feb. 5 vs. Orlando and Feb. 7 vs. Atlanta). In short, this could be a prime opportunity for Boston to gain a little ground in the playoff chase. 4. Nuggets, Jazz finally square off Based on current configurations, the 2019-20 Northwest Division title seems destined to land in Utah or Denver. As the Nuggets host the Jazz tonight ( 10 ET, TNT ), there are almost too many interesting matchups to keep tabs on. Utah leads the NBA in 3-point percentage (38.4%) while Denver allows the second-lowest 3-point percentage (33.6%) in the NBA. Then, of course, there\u2019s the center matchup of the defensive-minded Rudy Gobert taking on Denver\u2019s offensive-minded Nikola Jokic. Throw in Donovan Mitchell vs. Denver\u2019s stout perimeter defense, a variety of X-factor-type players on both rosters and this one should be juicy.  5. On this date: A magical encore Back on Jan. 30, 1996, Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers came out of retirement, helping lead the Lakers to 128-118 victory over Golden State at the Great Western Forum. In his first game in more than five years, Johnson had 19 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists."},{"id":29051,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/carmelo-anthony-passes-kevin-garnett-all-time-scoring","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Carmelo Anthony passes Kevin Garnett on career scoring list","content":"With a layup in the second quarter vs. the Rockets on Wednesday, Carmelo Anthony moved into 17th place on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, passing Kevin Garnett. The bucket at the 9:14 mark in the second quarter gave Anthony six points (and counting) for the night and made his career total 26,073, surpassing Garnett\u2019s 26,071. He did not score again in the Trail Blazers\u2019 125-112 win. Anthony could move up two more spots on the list this season if he keeps scoring at the same 16.1 ppg pace, possibly moving past John Havlicek (26,395) and Paul Pierce (26,397)."},{"id":29074,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oladipo-caps-emotional-week-winning-return","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Victor Oladipo caps emotional week with winning return to action for Pacers","content":" INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Rust. Rust. Rust. Rust. Rust. Ru\u2013 V.O.! That\u2019s how it went for Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers in his first game back in a year, the residue of recovery and rehab messing with him repeatedly through the first 20 minutes or so he played Wednesday night against the Bulls . Miss after miss from 3-point range, a half dozen before he got one right \u2014 about what you\u2019d expect given the severity of his injury (rare rupture of his right quadriceps tendon) and the length of his layoff (371 days dating to Jan. 23, 2019). So when Indiana, down 100-97, had the ball with 23 seconds left, neither coach Nate McMillan nor the other Pacers even looked to Oladipo. Justin Holiday launched a 3 from the right corner and missed. So much for Hollywood endings. Until \u2026 wait, what? The ball squirted out of bounds off Chicago, and the Pacers huddled with another chance to force overtime. The idea this time: Free up Malcolm Brogdon with a pin-down screen for another shot from the arc. Good idea, until that left corner got so crowded that Holiday heaved the ball out to Oladipo. He was 28 feet out on the left wing. The Bulls\u2019 Chandler Hutchison had his heels on the 3-point line. Too much space, and \u2014 No, no, he didn\u2019t! Uh, yes he did. Oladipo launched right over Hutchison and sent Bankers Life Fieldhouse, already celebrating and chanting for him much of the night, into convulsions of elation. It was almost as if someone had scripted it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he expected me to shoot that,\u201d Oladipo said later. \u201cDid you expect me to shoot that? Not a chance. \u201cI got the ball. I looked over to see if the play was forming. It didn\u2019t form. I went into V.O. mode after that. Simple as that. \u2018Mamba mentality.\u2019\u201d Nobody was getting this relatively small-scale hoops action twisted with the events that had shaken the NBA and the sports world to their core at the start of the week \u2013 Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others perishing in a helicopter crash Sunday. But hard or sad perspectives have been forced on a lot of folks by the tragedy, and Oladipo \u2013 more pensive than most and with nothing but time on his hands \u2013 already had processed some of the feelings. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about the six I missed,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cI just thought about banging that one. The rest of the game didn\u2019t matter. I was just staying in the moment \u2014 I got that from Kobe. \u201cObviously I got a little emotional out there. That\u2019s just because, the week has been emotional.\u201d Oladipo had targeted this one against the Bulls, the first of three straight and six of seven at home, for his return. He had missed the equivalent of a full NBA season, 82 games, during which Indiana went 46-36 without him. That included a surprising 30-17 mark prior to what became the 115-106 overtime victory Wednesday. He wasn\u2019t out there for the extra five minutes, the team\u2019s training staff cutting short by a few what had been penciled as a 24-minute limit. Didn\u2019t matter, the game pivoted on Oladipo\u2019s shot. The Pacers scrambled from seven down late in regulation, then blew out the Bulls in the extra period. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t passing the ball,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThat\u2019s a shot he\u2019s been practicing all summer long. Even though he couldn\u2019t move, this summer I watched him in Miami. That shot, he has been working on.\u201d The Pacers coach game Oladipo high marks for the quickness he showed and a willingness to fight through screens defensively, as well as venture into traffic on offense. \u201cWhat that tells me is, he trusts his body,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWhat you look for in a player when they come back injury, especially being off for a year, is hesitancy. And I didn\u2019t think he played hesitant out there.\u201d Oladipo missed shots, threaded some nice passes \u2013 he finished with nine points, four assists, two rebounds and two turnovers \u2014 and got over some early jitters. He was appreciative enough to be back that, in the home locker room, he thanked his teammates both before and after the game. \u201cThere was a lot surrounding my return,\u201d Oladipo said. He talked and talked after the game because, just like he had missed a season\u2019s worth of playing appearances, he also missed a year\u2019s worth of postgame podiums. \u201cI just wanted to thank them because they needed to hear it. Guys who don\u2019t play that much were playing with me [3-on-3, 4-on-4] pretty much every day or every other day trying to get me ready. They guys lifted me up, holding it down out there [for this season\u2019s surprising start]. They\u2019ve been great people before basketball players.\u201d They\u2019re going to need to stay that way. Working Oladipo back in for a night or two is an adrenaline thing, but reconfiguring the lineups and the pecking order of a team that has been thriving can be tricky. How long it takes the 27-year-old guard to regain his All-Star form, that\u2019s big. But giving him the room to do it without losing the contributions or focus of teammates who\u2019ve been fighting without the cavalry could be even bigger. McMillan knows it and isn\u2019t even sugar-coating it. Right off, he named the three players whose roles and minutes might get shaved now: guards Aaron Holiday, T.J. McConnell and Jeremy Lamb. The latter two were fine against Chicago, logging their customary minutes. But Holiday got a DNP-CD; his 10.4 points, his 3.5 rebounds, his floor work and his defense weren\u2019t needed because of the matchups McMillan sought. And in the coming days, weeks and months, it could be the other two whose toes get stepped on. \u201cWhen a player gets hurt, [another] player steps up into his role,\u201d said Bulls coach Jim Boylen. \u201cThat is easier than when that [injured] player comes back and [the replacement] has to step back into the role he previously had. That\u2019s the trick. It\u2019s very difficult. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going from playing these minutes to these minutes now, and I\u2019ve got to do it the right way and play hard.\u2019 It\u2019s hard on everybody.\u201d One game in and given the outcome, there mostly was kumbaya emanating from the Pacers. Time will tell. Factor in so many new faces who just got their first game experience with Oladipo \u2013 guys such as Brogdon, McConnell, Lamb, Justin Holiday, T.J. Warren \u2013 and there clearly is a lot of learning to do. \u201cAny time you add a guy like Vic, things are going to change. And they\u2019re going to change for the better,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe just have to figure out the way he plays, because we\u2019re new to this team. Figure out his spots and everything. So it\u2019s an adjustment period, but for the better.\u201d If so, the Pacers will have gotten a week\u2019s jump on the league\u2019s trade deadline, adding talent without shedding a soul. That could generate a lot of moments worth staying in. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

As they left the court, they all passed under the oversized 8 and 24 outlined in white on the black wall above the door to their locker room. Anthony Davis and several other Lakers paused and looked up at Kobe Bryant\u2019s two retired numbers for a moment before they moved forward. The Lakers are still grieving and mourning Bryant\u2019s death Sunday in a helicopter crash along with his daughter, Gianna, and seven others. Los Angeles\u2019 players and coaches returned to work Wednesday at their training complex with a determination to keep Bryant and the victims in their thoughts while getting on with the business of basketball and life. \u201cWe want to represent what Kobe was about, more than anything,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to make him proud, and that\u2019s not going to be any different now.\u201d Vogel, who joined the Lakers eight months ago, was the only person to speak to the media after the workout. The loss apparently was still too raw for the players, including superstars LeBron James and Davis, who played in the Olympics with Bryant. Although Bryant retired in 2016, he is still enormously important to his franchise and his sport. Ever since the Lakers drafted the 17-year-old guard from suburban Philadelphia in 1996, Bryant had been a face of this franchise and a basketball-mad city while he became a five-time NBA champion and his team\u2019s career leader in points and games played. The current Lakers are still grappling with the loss while they prepare for their next game Friday night at Staples Center against Portland. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a family in a very short time,\u201d Vogel said of the Lakers\u2019 roster, which features only one player who suited up with Bryant. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we talk about in the NBA with your teams, but this group in particular has really grown to love each other very rapidly, and we understand the importance and the opportunity we have this year. This has just brought us closer together.\u201d Outside the Lakers\u2019 training complex, a temporary wall of remembrance has grown to nearly the entire length of the building, bookended on either side by large photos and colorful memorials to the Bryants. Fans have streamed through the security gates and up to the wall throughout the past three days, using markers to inscribe their thoughts and prayers on the white surface. Bryant\u2019s death has temporarily overwhelmed an exciting season of rebirth for the Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for a franchise-record six straight years. The current Lakers are poised for a serious run at the franchise\u2019s 17th championship, with James and Davis leading a burgeoning powerhouse to the Western Conference\u2019s best record at 36-10. But life and basketball have been put in a new perspective for everyone around the Lakers. After their game against the Clippers on Tuesday night was postponed, the players and coaches gathered that afternoon to share stories and remembrances because it felt \u201ctherapeutic and beneficial,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that has touched my family, being the father of daughters, and it\u2019s been very emotional,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that brings us together. I\u2019m around the people who were closest to Kobe throughout his time here, and it\u2019s been just a deeply saddening time for all of us.\u201d Indeed, Bryant still had close ties to dozens of employees of the organization for which he played his entire 20-year career. Lakers owner Jeanie Buss was quite close to his family, and general manager Rob Pelinka was Bryant\u2019s longtime agent. Only veteran Lakers center Dwight Howard played alongside Bryant in purple and gold, albeit briefly in their disappointing 2012-13 season. But almost everyone on Los Angeles\u2019 rebuilt roster played against Kobe, and they all knew and respected the most prolific scorer in Lakers history. \u201cHe was the most feared man in the league for an entire generation,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHis influence is found league-wide, in basketball league-wide, and the Lakers family worldwide.\u201d The Lakers\u2019 two biggest stars had friendships with Kobe. James and Bryant were teammates on two U.S. Olympic teams, while Davis also was a young backup on the 2012 Olympic squad. James wrote an emotional Instagram post about Bryant on Monday, saying: \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll continue your legacy man! You mean so much to us all here \u2026 and it\u2019s my responsibility to put this (team) on my back and keep it going!!\u201d Lakers reserve guard Quinn Cook is changing his jersey number from 2 to 28 to honor Kobe, who wore No. 8 for the first half of his NBA career, and Gianna, who favored a No. 2 jersey in her youth basketball career. The University of Connecticut placed a No. 2 jersey on its bench this week in honor of Gianna, who hoped to play for the basketball powerhouse. Gianna Bryant\u2019s death clearly hurt the Lakers. Vogel and his wife have two young daughters. \u201cIt\u2019s what your life is about,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHim being a father to daughters and being involved in their sports was the most enjoyable thing in his life from observation, and it\u2019s the most important thing in my life. I love being the coach of the Lakers, but it doesn\u2019t come close to comparing to my family time.\u201d"},{"id":29057,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-jersey-number-changes-honor-kobe-bryant","date":"2020-01-29","title":"Multiple NBA players change jersey numbers to honor Kobe Bryant","content":" The NBA is allowing players to change their jersey numbers mid-season in order to honor the legacies of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.

Despite sitting at eighth in voting by fans for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game after final results were released, Booker came in fourth for guards in the Western Conference in the votes submitted by the players. \u201cThat was good news, something similar to last year,\u201d Booker said last Friday afternoon before dropping a 35-point, 10-assist double-double later that night in a win over the San Antonio Spurs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the player rank was last year, but I even spoke on that and said I\u2019m happy that\u2019s the situation. I earned respect from my peers, the guys that spend countless hours in the gym that we get to compete against. So that means a lot to me.\u201d What\u2019s not so significant for Booker these days is actually making the NBA All-Star Game. While the vast majority of players around the league view earning a selection as key in defining their career legacies, Booker\u2019s recent circumstances somewhat jade his perspective. Responding diplomatically to the question of whether making the All-Star team enhances a player\u2019s career legacy, Booker points to the game\u2019s current format to explain his ambivalence. \u201cIt\u2019s not even East versus West really,\u201d Booker said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s not my decision to determine anybody\u2019s legacy. And I don\u2019t think it determines anybody\u2019s legacy because of the format now.\u201d  Many of Booker\u2019s peers disagree, including his own coach, Monty Williams, who played nine seasons for five teams in the NBA and never was selected to play in the league\u2019s annual midseason showcase. \u201cI never did it, but when you have that kind of talent it absolutely is important,\u201d Williams told NBA.com. \u201cYou want to be known as one of the best players, and when you put up those kinds of numbers and help your team win games, I think that should be recognized. All the factors should be put into the equation. So, I think it is important.\u201d So does San Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, a four-time All-Star, who has twice been named to the All-NBA team. Lacing up a pair of pink sneakers from the Kobe Bryant Nike line in New Orleans ahead of the Spurs\u2019 win over the Pelicans in Zion Williamson\u2019s electrifying debut, DeRozan squinted curiously when asked whether NBA All-Star appearances help to cement a player\u2019s legacy. \u201cHow many people have you asked this?\u201d DeRozan asked. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s important. Anybody coming into the league, you want to be an All-Star. Obviously, after being there X amount of times, you get a different feel for it. But I think it\u2019s important, you know what I mean? You want to check off everything down the list once you come into the league. I remember when I first was a part of the USA team. I felt like I had to be a part of this because not everybody gets this opportunity, and this goes on your resume forever. \u201cSame with All-Stars, same with championships, same with First-, Second-, and Third-Team All-NBA; all of those things. Not too many people get the opportunity to have that. Even the playoffs. You want to make it to the playoffs, then you want to make it out of the first round. Then you want to make it out of the second round. You want to know what it\u2019s like to have a conference finals, and then ultimately win a championship. So, I think All-Stars are definitely important to your legacy.\u201d For some players, that sentiment changes over time. A four-time All-Star as a Portland Trail Blazer, LaMarcus Aldridge signed with the San Antonio Spurs before the 2015-16 season, and has since earned three more trips to the All-Star game. Aldridge entered this week having connected on a career-best 42.7% from 3-point range, and with 50 made 3-pointers through the first 42 games, he\u2019s on pace to more than double his previous career-high of 37 buckets from deep, which he set during his final season in Portland (2014-15). In the win over the Pelicans on Wednesday, Aldridge registered his 16th game with 30-plus points and 10-plus rebounds as a Spur. Still, Aldridge faces long odds to make this year\u2019s All-Star team, which is why he\u2019s thinking more about vacationing in Cabo San Lucas during All-Star 2020 than actually playing in the game. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to make the team for players who feel like they\u2019re playing at that level,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cYou put the work in, and you feel like you\u2019re a top 10 or 15 guy in the league or in your conference. So, I think it\u2019s definitely important for guys to make it. Some guys actually have bonuses tied to it in their contracts. I don\u2019t have those types of things. Some guys have shoe contract stuff tied to that. But I think more than that, it makes the respect be known around the league among your peers that you are playing at that high of a level.\u201d Aldridge admits the importance of making the All-Star team started to wane for him after being snubbed a couple of seasons during his time in Portland. Perhaps Booker, in his fifth year, feels similarly as he still hasn\u2019t been selected for his first All-Star game. Neither has Utah\u2019s Mike Conley, one of the league\u2019s most underrated point guards for the majority of his 13-year NBA career. When Conley\u2019s teammate Rudy Gobert didn\u2019t make the roster last year, he said \u201cit\u2019s just about my legacy\u201d and eventually ended the interview with tears in his eyes . Meanwhile, Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young cried after finding out he made the team last week. It means that much. \u201cYou want to make it and have that as something to add to your legacy, just to be seen as one of the top players,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cBut anything can happen. So, you really can\u2019t put all your energy into that. It\u2019s about winning. I think if you win, and you take care of your season, then everything else takes care of itself.\u201d Mavericks power forward and one-time All-Star Kristaps Porzingis agreed. \u201cIt does matter of course,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cAt the end of your career, everybody looks at what you\u2019ve accomplished, not only as a team, but also individually. Now, my mindset is always once you\u2019re winning and you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re supposed to be doing with your team, then all of the individual accolades come with that. That\u2019s my mindset. So, I try not to focus too much on the individual things. I want to win. I want to be remembered as a winner. That\u2019s where my mind is at.\u201d Five-time All-Star center Al Horford shook his head and wagged a finger when it was suggested that for some players, All-Star selections aren\u2019t legacy defining. \u201cNo, no, no, it matters, no question,\u201d Horford told NBA.com. \u201cObviously, I can speak only for myself, but I always play to win, and for my teams to do well. But you definitely want to be recognized. You want to be acknowledged. You want to be in those positions and have that experience, no question about it.\u201d  Perhaps deep down, Booker longs for all of that, too. It\u2019s certainly clear he\u2019s miffed about not ever making an All-Star team despite being one of the league\u2019s most dynamic scorers over the last three years. The argument that team success plays a role probably falls on deaf ears for Booker, too, considering Young was recently named an All-Star starter for the East team. The Atlanta Hawks have the worst record in the conference. Meanwhile, Luka Doncic, James Harden and Damian Lillard were the only guards in All-Star player voting to receive more votes than Booker. Doncic, Harden, and Lillard all ranked ahead of Booker in fan voting along with Russell Westbrook and Donovan Mitchell. Booker tied for fourth in voting among members of the media, who were allowed to vote for just two backcourt players. Doncic, Harden and Lillard were the only guards to receive votes. Fan voting accounts for 50% of the vote, while the ballots tabulated among the players and media accounts for 25% each. Through the first half of the season, Booker averaged a career-high 27.0 points to go with 6.3 assists per game and 4.0 rebounds while shooting nearly 51% from the field. Booker could still make his first All-Star team if he\u2019s selected by the coaches, who are tasked with choosing the reserves for the game. It will be announced Thursday night on TNT. Williams is certainly campaigning on Booker\u2019s behalf. \u201cThe players know, and the coaches should know,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf you look at that list of guys, how many of those guys get blitzed as much as Devin? How many of those guys have played without their second-best player for close to 30 games? You look at the efficiency with how he\u2019s played, and he plays on all three levels. He never ducks a matchup. I forget who wrote it, but somebody was talking about his defensive lapses. Yet he never ducks a matchup. If you had to produce that much on offense, you\u2019d have a few lapses also. You never see Devin take the easiest guy. So, the players know, and I believe the coaches know. I hope it works out for him.\u201d As for Booker, he\u2019s understandably uncomfortable with the prospect of his legacy being built on the foundation of All-Star selections, considering he\u2019s been worthy of the honor over the years. Booker pulled a hood over his head walking off the court Friday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio as an idling bus waited. Looking up on the walk to the bus, Booker spotted the large replicas of the Spurs five championship banners lining the wall and pointed at them. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve played at an All-Star level for the last three years, so I\u2019m not going to let anyone else decide my legacy,\u201d Booker told NBA.com. \u201cI care more about getting some of these.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Oladipo set to return for Pacers It has been nearly a full year since Victor Oladipo suited up in a game for the Indiana Pacers, but that streak will come to an end tonight vs. the Chicago Bulls ( 7 ET, League Pass ). The Pacers have hung tough in the Eastern Conference all season and are the No. 6 seed as of this morning , but are just three games behind the Miami Heat for the No. 2 seed. It\u2019s still unknown if Oladipo will start tonight, but rest assured some changes in on-court flow and other aspects loom for Indiana as he works himself back into the mix. 2. Chance for Jazz to bounce back Utah had every reason to expect to win on Monday against Houston, what with the Rockets not suiting up Russell Westbrook, James Harden or Clint Capela for that game. Yet the Jazz got roasted (thanks in large part to Eric Gordon\u2019s 50-point game ) and momentarily lost some hard-fought ground in the Western Conference standings. A trip to San Antonio is next for Utah ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) and another guard could stand to torment them, perhaps. DeMar DeRozan has been hot in January (26.1 ppg, 56% from field) and averaged 21.7 ppg against the Jazz last season. 3. Morant heads to MSG The list of rookies who have taken the NBA world by storm this year is likely two: Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant and New Orleans\u2019 Zion Williamson. While Williamson is only four games into his career, though, Morant has been delivering thrills all season long. He\u2019s fresh off a 14-point, six-rebound, seven-assist night in an upset of the Nuggets as he readies for his first game at Madison Square Garden ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). Many a legend regarding an opposing player has been born at MSG, so it will be exciting to see if Morant puts something extra in his game in his first New York performance. 4. Another Anthony reunion with Rockets Carmelo Anthony\u2019s first run of \u201creunion\u201d games with his former teams have come and gone. But tonight ( 10 ET, ESPN ), his Blazers host the Houston Rockets in what could be an intriguing matchup for both teams. Houston should have its full lineup back (after Westbrook, Harden and Capela sat out the team\u2019s last game) and there\u2019s the always exciting matchup between Damian Lillard and Westbrook. But don\u2019t overlook Anthony and him matching up with Houston\u2019s defensive perimeter ace, PJ Tucker. The last time these teams met, Anthony was 3-for-3 and scored nine points when Tucker guarded him. 5. On this date: The 1st All-Star Saturday There\u2019s a little more than two weeks to go until NBA All-Star 2020 in Chicago gets fully underway. Every year, the All-Star weekend is a spectacle unto itself in the NBA, but it wasn\u2019t always like this. Back on Jan. 29, 1984, the first All-Star Saturday took place in Denver. Back then, there was a Schick Legends Classic (which the West won 64-63) and the first Slam Dunk Contest, which featured a thrilling showdown between the Suns\u2019 Larry Nance (who won the event), the Sixers\u2019 Julius Erving and the Hawks\u2019 Dominique Wilkins."},{"id":29108,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/victor-oladipo-set-return-pacers-rotation-wednesday","date":"2020-01-29","title":"Victor Oladipo returns to Pacers rotation Wednesday","content":" INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Victor Oladipo spent 12 months working, wondering and watching. He strengthened his body, his mind, his injured right knee and promised to return a better player. Now, he\u2019s finally healthy enough to start proving it. The All-Star guard made his long-anticipated season debut Wednesday when the Indiana Pacers hosted Chicago. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to do anything out there miraculous, I just expect to play basketball to the best of my ability,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cI know I\u2019ll get better as time goes on and I\u2019ve got to be patient with my body and patient with the game. But I\u2019m a competitor. I know it isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201d Oladipo probably knew that much the moment he couldn\u2019t get up after crashing to the floor late in the first half of last January\u2019s game against Toronto. He left the court on a stretcher amid a crescendo of cheers from his adoring fans. Players around the league quickly took to social media to offer their encouragement, too. The next day, team officials announced Oladipo needed season-ending surgery on a ruptured quad tendon, setting off a prolonged recovery period. By the time he returned to practice, at training camp, the Pacers had a revamped roster. They acquired three new starters during the offseason \u2014 Malcolm Brogdon, Jeremy Lamb and T.J. Warren \u2014 and added forward Domantas Sabonis to the lineup. Meanwhile, Oladipo continued rehabbing and started making semi-regular trips to Fort Wayne, working with Indiana\u2019s G League affiliate for the final phase of his comeback. \u201cI was trying to get as much as I could out of my rehab so eventually I could have a day like [Wednesday],\u201d Oladipo said. The Pacers will play it safe with their top star, at least initially. Coach Nate McMillan told reporters Tuesday that Oladipo\u2019s minutes will be limited until after the All-Star break. He declined to provide specifics and wouldn\u2019t say whether Oladipo would start or come off the bench against the Bulls. But with Indiana holding the No. 5 spot in the Eastern Conference, at 30-17, and just 2 1\/2 games out of the No. 2 spot without Oladipo, there\u2019s no need to push him back. Oladipo\u2019s return will change things. \u201cThis will be the first time we have all of our guys back and all of us are going to have to sacrifice, even Victor,\u201d McMillan said, citing an extraordinarily large media contingent at practice as an indication of what will be different. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be all about Victor. It\u2019s about us. Roles are going to change. The rotation is going to change. So you can embrace it or you can go against it. I expect us to embrace it.\u201d Adjusting on the fly is part of the basketball business. Last week, the New Orleans Pelicans got their first real glimpse of Zion Williamson, last summer\u2019s top overall draft pick. Philadelphia center Joel Embiid was cleared to play Tuesday after missing three weeks with a dislocated finger on his left hand. The Golden State Warriors could get Stephen Curry (broken left hand) back following the All-Star break. Klay Thompson also remains out with a torn ACL in his left knee. For Oladipo, the obstacles have been daunting. \u201cGetting my range of motion back was the most unique thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in my life, learning how to force yourself to bend your knee,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery morning for a month or month and a half, I was waking up with a rope trying to pull my knee to my butt in excruciating pain. It\u2019s like, do you really have to teach your knee how to bend again?\u201d Yet, here he is 371 days later, wearing white padded sleeves over his knees, shooting 3-pointers and still laughing and singing. His mother and sister are already in town to watch the big return and some friends will join them Wednesday, too. But all that time away from the game also has helped Oladipo develop new perspective on life. All those well wishers, who offered support and prayers, helped Oladipo understand the value he has on and off the court. The long journey back forced him to become even more patience, a trait that could come in handy as he tries to regain his pre-injury form. \u201cWhenever you\u2019ve been off for that long, you don\u2019t just come back,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cA year is a long time and it takes you a while to get your timing and rhythm, your feel and trust. All of that takes some time. So I don\u2019t expect him to be the Victor of old tomorrow. I expect him to go out and play.\u201d "},{"id":29082,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/joel-embiid-returns-torn-ligament-hand","date":"2020-01-29","title":"Joel Embiid returns from torn ligament in hand","content":" PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Joel Embiid returned to the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 lineup three weeks after surgery on a torn ligament in a finger in his left hand.

As a basketball community, as the world as a whole, I know we\u2019re just mourning and sticking together when it comes to this.\u201d Durant\u2019s teammate Spencer Dinwiddie has paid tribute to Bryant by switching from No. 8 \u2014 the number Bryant wore his first 10 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 to No. 26. As for Durant, he believes honoring Bryant would mean for \u201cevery basketball player [to] go out there and play as hard as they can every night.\u201d Still, considering Bryant\u2019s impact on the game and the legacy he leaves behind, even that seems insufficient to Durant. \u201cIt feels like nothing will ever be big enough to truly honor Kobe Bryant.\u201d"},{"id":29154,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-mailbag-jan-28","date":"2020-01-28","title":"Kia MVP Ladder mailbag: Can Russell Westbrook move up in the chase?","content":" In light of the recent passing of Los Angeles Lakers great Kobe Bryant, his daughter, Gianna, and the seven others in a helicopter crash on Sunday, we felt it best to keep it brief this week and get straight to your letters regarding the latest Kia Race to the MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Zachary Sandwick Jan. 21, 2020 | 5:38 p.m. My name is Zachary, I\u2019m 11 and a huge Utah Jazz fan. I am so happy that Rudy Gobert is on the Ladder, but my attention is on another thing. First, you can\u2019t have a team without good players. But if you have players\/a player who scores 40 points a night but doesn\u2019t get his team wins, he\u2019s not MVP material. I think your MVP Ladders are great and on point. I just think the last five players (like Donovan Mitchell and Domantas Sabonis) are a little off. First, the Pacers are doing great, but it\u2019s not just Sabonis \u2014 there\u2018s still Malcolm Brogdon and Myles Turner. I also think Kemba Walker should be higher because he has two All-Star players other than him (Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown) who are averaging over 20 ppg and Kemba is still putting up numbers like that. Here is my ladder: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3.  James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Jimmy Butler 7. Rudy Gobert 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Donovan Mitchell 10. Chris Paul 11. Anthony Davis (injuries) 12. Kemba Walker 13. Paul George (injuries) 14. Ben Simmons 15. DeMar DeRozan Sorry if I was biased toward the Jazz. (Injuries) means that they\u2019re lower because of injuries (either current or old ones). * * * My response: Thanks for taking the time Zachary. I always love hearing from future generations of NBA fans. And don\u2019t worry about any bias around here \u2026 everyone comes with their own agenda. I agree with you on Kemba\u2019s status this season. I\u2019ve been high on his performance all season (more so maybe than some of my media brethren). It\u2019s not easy to do what he\u2019s done in Boston. Oh, and those last five are always listed in alphabetical order. The numbers run through 10 only. From: Ed Adcock Jan. 21, 2020 | 5:30 p.m. Looking at your last list I was very much surprised to see Jimmy Butler in 4th place. I feel like this is a case of Miami being a surprise team this year, second in the East, and therefore the need to have someone from the Heat in the list \u2026 which I don\u2019t understand at all. The problem with that is that although Jimmy has been playing well, Miami\u2019s success has been based around the entire roster performing. To just drop him in at No. 4 does not make sense. When you look at Jimmy (20.3 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 6.5 apg, 1.8 spg, 0.6 bpg) vs. Anthony Davis (26.5 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 3.2 apg, 1.5 spg, 2.5 bpg) and Kawhi Leonard (27.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 5.2 apg, 2.0 spg, 0.6 bpg) his numbers simply don\u2019t stack up. Plus, the overall records of the Lakers (34-9) and LA Clippers (30-13) are equal or better than Miami\u2019s (30-13). If you want to get into games played as well there isn\u2019t much discrepancy there (Butler 40, Davis 39, Leonard 36) and when you look at per 36 minutes stats, the case goes further in favor of Davis and Leonard. You also can\u2019t say Jimmy\u2019s defense is superior to either Davis or Leonard and, in a lot of people\u2019s eyes, Davis is the Defensive Player of the Year. The way you look at it from any angle is that Jimmy is not a Top 5 candidate. Top 10 may be a stretch, but I wouldn\u2019t have an issue with him being at the bottom of the top 10 list. I\u2019m keen to hear your thoughts. * * * My response: Lots of folks want to make the Kia MVP Ladder a strictly numerical affair, Ed. And I get that. I just think it does a disservice to the context that has to accompany any conversation about the best of the best. Butler\u2019s impact on the Heat has been everything in Miami. He\u2019s not asked to score the way some other guys are. And Miami\u2019s collective rises because of his presence. Westbrook on a roll  From: Ryan Tretsky Jan. 22, 2020 | 5:35 a.m. I\u2019ve been watching Houston very closely as Russell Westbrook is my favorite player. I have noticed that one of the main reasons that Westbrook is playing so much better is because he has taken less attempts from the 3-point line since the season turned around for him in mid-December. I also notice that Westbrook gets an insane amount of hate from fans that is not deserved as he is a player that tries his hardest day in and day out. What else does Russell Westbrook need to do, besides improve his jump shot, which it seems he is trying to do while taking less of them? I also am a firm believer that James Harden might needs to have his minutes reduced while he is in his slump and that Westbrook should be the leader of the team until Harden can get back on track. I also think that James Harden is making the same mistake Westbrook made last year and earlier this year: he is taking too many shots with nothing to show and he does not pass enough. I remember Shaquille O\u2019Neal said in the OKC vs. Portland playoff series last year that Paul George and Russ were playing \u201chero ball.\u201d It seems Harden is doing that now instead of Westbrook and it hurts his chances of winning MVP in my opinion. Houston has two MVP candidates, but their problems lie in Harden not being able to share and cooperate. Will this affect them in the playoffs in your opinion or will Harden get over this? * * * My response: Ryan, I think Russ needs to keep doing exactly what he\u2019s been doing recently: continue to play to his strengths and with that fire that few others in the league can match. I\u2019m not as worried about he and Harden working out the details right now. They\u2019ve had half a season to figure it out. Come playoff time, I suspect they\u2019ll be in a much better rhythm as a duo. That narrative about both of these guys being so difficult to play with has been interesting, given all of the success they\u2019ve had (both together earlier in their careers and more recently with other All-Star counterparts). I\u2019m going to trust the process, for now, where the Rockets are concerned. Where in the world is Lillard?  From: Ann Garrison Jan. 22, 2020 | 8:08 p.m. I cannot fathom why Damian Lillard is never in your MVP conversation. This week I saw him put up 61 points to lead the Blazers past the Warriors in the clutch, and that was just the most spectacular of his many spectacular performances. He also seems to be more cool-headed than anyone but Kawhi Leonard, who bleeds antifreeze. Lillard\u2019s team could be doing better, but Trae Young\u2019s team could be doing a lot better \u2014 and you\u2019re talking about him.  * * * My response: That\u2019s a legitimate gripe you bring up, Ann. The slow start in Portland has allowed some of us to sleep on Dame a little bit. But he did join the party last week and will probably be due for a nice bump this week, based on the show he\u2019s been putting on. Like most of the league\u2019s best players, Dame tends to be a (an unwitting) victim of his own greatness. We expect so much from these guys that we sometimes take for granted when they deal with the sort of transition the Trail Blazers have had to this season. I don\u2019t like getting scolded like this, so I vow to do better from this point forward. Taking the long view on LeBron  From: Bryan Jan. 23, 2020 | 7:30 p.m. I have watched basketball for over 60 years through all the eras. First off, I admit there has probably never been any player like LeBron. Having said that I do NOT understand the lust relationship that sports writers have with him. He scores, he rebounds, he passes, he whines, he has NEVER committed a foul, he flops, he dribbles, he travels. Geez, Louise. Watch the recent game versus the Celtics for instance. Watch his face. Watch his moves OFF the ball. Watch his flops, his whines to the refs. I will NEVER support him for MVP for most of the things I have listed that he is good at. He comes to a team and drags another star along (Davis) and immediately they both become MVP candidates? How is that possible? I think the move to PG was a recognition of his inability to play the game as a mere contributor instead of a COACH ON THE FLOOR \u2014 which I think is his biggest flaw. You all love\/lust after LeBron. I think he\u2019s a good ballplayer, but his impact on any one particular game is overrated. * * * My response: I don\u2019t get the disdain for LeBron\u2019s game, Bryan. I really don\u2019t. For a guy to be as effective as he\u2019s been for as long as he has, even if you\u2019re not a fan, I figure he\u2019d have to have earned your respect by now. And yes, the Lakers lead the Western Conference on the strength of LeBron and AD as a dynamic duo. I think they both belong in the MVP conversation. Zion\u2019s debut raises eyebrows  From: B.J. Simpson Jan. 24, 2020 | 12:28 a.m. My friends and I have had a lot of fun watching this NBA season, especially due to how wide-open the league seemed, even if the true contenders have been slimmed down a bit. Being a Lakers fan, I really hope LeBron is going to win the MVP. (He\u2019s prolly not, considering the amount of love the media has for Giannis Antetokounmpo, which is totally deserved.) But after the events of last night, it has come to my attention that some of my friends truly believe something: Zion will be a contender for the MVP award. Now, he\u2019s been out for half of the season, making him a hard bet for even the Rookie of the Year award. But MVP sounded outrageous to me. But then I started thinking: This was a player who has been doing outrageous stuff all throughout his life. He may have a 3-point shot now, and more importantly, he has the perfect storyline: Rookie comes back from injury to lead his team to playoffs. Hard to imagine, but yet, still possible. So here\u2019s my question: what would it take in your opinion for Zion to win (or even be in your ladder) for MVP? * * * My response: B.J., I was waiting on this email after Zion\u2019s debut. Seriously, I was waiting on someone to dive in. You are right, he faces an uphill battle to get in on the Kia Rookie Ladder given the headstart the rest of the guys in his class have on him. And there\u2019s no one on that list making a dent on the MVP Ladder anytime soon. That\u2019s not to disrespect what the young guys are doing as Ja Morant and his Grizzlies have been balling. But in my humble opinion, Zion in the MVP conversation this season is just not a realistic option. And I\u2019m here for all things Zion. But I\u2019m not going there \u2026 not yet. Leonard over Doncic, Harden makes no sense  From:  Ethan Jan. 24, 2020 | 12:23 p.m. I follow your MVP Ladder and usually have no qualms with your picks. However, this week has really confused me. How can we put Kawhi over Luka and Harden? As the saying goes, the best ability is availability \u2026 and Kawhi has played six less games than Luka and eight less than Harden. These games are times when Luka and Harden have been leading their teams to wins in the Western Conference gauntlet. Independently, all the stats (regular, and advanced) show Doncic and Harden to be having more valuable season. Maybe I put a little more weight into BPM and VORP\/WS and other advanced statistics than you, but I really feel like you are using Leonard\u2019s past playoff heroics to put him over players having superior statistical seasons. With all that being said, my top 5 are: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Luka Doncic 4. James Harden T-5. Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard * * * My response: I\u2019m going to make it simple, Ethan: Kawhi\u2019s ability to dominate the game on both ends will not be compromised by his availability, or lack thereof. I think we\u2019re being extremely shortsighted in our evaluation of him when we hold his \u201cinjury management\u201d program against him. It has to be factored into the equation, no doubt. But not to the point where we ignore the obvious. From:  Carson Jan. 24, 2020 | 12:55 p.m. I gotta admit, your Top 5 gets more and more convincing every week. There are a number of players that someone could make a Top 3 case for, but I don\u2019t see how ANYONE can justify not having Giannis at No. 1. Sure, there may be a wide variety of criteria that can be used to determine the MVP, but Giannis checks off all the boxes! His offensive stats this season are phenomenal. He is one of the elite defenders in the league. He is on arguably the best team in the league, while simultaneously being the CLEAR best player on the team. Not to mention, he possesses tier-1 character and gives his full effort night in and night out. When it comes to the MVP award, it shouldn\u2019t matter how good a player is for how old they are or how young they are. If Giannis\u2019 performance in the first half of the season holds true to the end, the decision should be unanimous. Anyway, here\u2019s my Top 5: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Luka Doncic 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Tacko Fall * * * My response: I was rocking with you Carson, right up until No. 5 \u2026 SMH! LeBron over Giannis Part I \u2026  From: Dylan Miller Jan. 24, 2020 | 3:29 p.m. Although Giannis has more wins and has LeBron beat in points, boards and blocks, LeBron is about to be No. 3 on the all-time scoring list. He clearly is a scorer and he leads the league in assists and he also has Giannis beat in triple-doubles. I think next week the list should be: 1. LeBron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Luka Doncic 4. Jimmy Butler 5. Kawhi Leonard From: Preston Smith Jan. 25, 2020 | 8:23 a.m. LeBron James, I believe, is making just as good a case for MVP as Giannis. First of all, even though the Bucks have had a better record overall they\u2019ve played easier teams. Second of all, behind AD and Danny Green, the Lakers just have mostly good role players. I was looking at plus\/minus and LeBron still leads the league in real plus minus. He also assists or scores on 52 points a game for the Lakers. I think that not many other players in the league would be able to do that in their prime \u2026 especially not at 35. I think that LeBron deserves the MVP just as much as Giannis because they are both playing outstanding basketball. I just think LeBron deserves to be in the lead a little more than Giannis. * * * My response: If it was a career milestone MVP, Dylan, we could cancel the race now and just give it to LeBron every season until he retires. No one will hit more milestones in the near future than LeBron. But Giannis isn\u2019t giving up the hardware without a fight this season. Someone will have to turn up (as you youngsters say), Preston, in a major way down the stretch of the season to snatch the No. 1 spot. It\u2019s not impossible. There\u2019s plenty of time left for this race to go through some significant changes. It just won\u2019t be easy with Giannis playing the way he\u2019s played all season. Consistency matters  From: Faizullah Faizullah Jan. 27, 2020 | 9:23 a.m. I been a constant viewer of your page, and I like the way you put things and give replies. I do agree with you with your list, but my doubt is so far Giannis is the fore runner and he had always been. Isn\u2019t that dominance enough to show who the MVP is? Most valuable player itself means the effect he is having from the very start to the end, and so far the only player to do it is LeBron. He had set backs when AD was having his streak, and Luka is been magnificent only after midseason or something. Harden is putting up incredible number but lacks wins. Kawhi doesn\u2019t have the fuel to continue for long and he is lacks that consistency. So, that leaves us with the last top contender: Giannis Antetokounmpo. He is promising that consistency everyone lacks.  I\u2019m always ready for your advice and correction. I\u2019m a 17-year-old school-level players and not into as much technical things as you are in. I\u2019m hoping to get a reply and anything\u2019s expected \u2014 advice, correction or criticism. And, I am joining all of those mourning the great loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter. Rest in peace to all those in the tragic accident. * * * My response: Thanks for emailing, Faizullah (check your inbox for a point-by-point response). We\u2019ll end the mailbag this week with your final thought, which I think is one that is shared universally by folks around the globe. It has been a rough couple of days for the entire NBA family. And I\u2019m sure Kobe\u2019s family and all of the other families affected appreciate the prayers and love. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Two years after Bryant retired in 2016, James became his superstar successor with the Lakers when he signed with the team in 2018. James went on to pass Bryant for third on the all-time scoring list on Saturday, leading to Bryant\u2019s final tweet:"},{"id":29150,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kobe-bryants-relentless-determination-resonated-throughout-los-angeles","date":"2020-01-28","title":"Kobe Bryant's relentless determination resonated throughout Los Angeles","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 Nobody ever accused Kobe Bryant, fierce competitor, of being a teddy bear on the court and yet here they are in all of their plushness, some adorned with the No. 8 across the chest and others with the No. 24. Those are the gifts that grab you by the throat and make it dry and swell. They\u2019re scattered in and around the candles and flowers in makeshift tributes left on asphalt by basketball fans still struggling to comprehend and even acknowledge what the hell just happened, just hours after getting sucker-punched in the soul. And of course, there\u2019s candy and ribbons and more stuffed animals for his 13-year-old daughter, Gigi, along with spot-on caricatures of her with her father and, well, they form puddles under your eyes. This phenomenon is ongoing, no doubt as you read this, right across the street from Staples Center, where foot traffic hasn\u2019t slowed since Sunday afternoon when folks heard the news and made a caravan for downtown L.A. It\u2019s also being replicated outside the Lakers practice facility in El Segundo, on a smaller scale, with loads of complete strangers pointing and milling around and exchanging hugs or glances and just not sure what to do next. The street artists are already fast at work around town, painting murals of Kobe on the sides of buildings and hearing absolutely no complaints. And so, it is happening here in L.A.: Bryant is being immortalized in the same tasteful flavor as other cultural icons of the past who met stunning deaths far too young, the Buddy Hollys and Roberto Clementes. The NBA postponed Tuesday\u2019s game between the Lakers and Clippers at Staples Center because it was just too soon, the pain too fresh and fleshy. Bryant and his daughter and seven other passengers aboard the retired star\u2019s helicopter perished only Sunday in the foggy Calabasas hills, and the tragedy continues to be too much for all parties involved. And that especially includes the Lakers. You see, the Lakers are family run and Kobe was family. He was once represented by Rob Pelinka, now the Lakers\u2019 vice president. He was practically adopted as a 17-year-old back in 1996 by the Buss family, with Jeanie, now the principal owner, among his very biggest fans. They knew his four children, knew his wife Vanessa and willingly went for the thrill ride on all the highs and lows. So the Lakers\u2019 organization lobbied the league to find another day on the calendar, with the blessing of the Clippers. No one took a poll of the players but there\u2019s a strong chance none were in the right frame of mind to play a basketball game anyway. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t have been a typical experience complete with the Laker Girls, pump-you-up music or halftime act; not the time or place for that. More like a memorial or a safe zone for 18,000 to grieve and celebrate a life well lived. The last time the league canceled a game because of a tragedy was the Boston Marathon bombing, and before that, the Kennedy murder. In other NBA cities Sunday and Monday, players were clearly distracted before and after tipoff. Those games were played but nothing came easily. The spirit was siphoned from those atmospheres and the mood dampened by games that began with a moment of silence and almost played with the same amount of mute. Bryant held such massive sway among current players because most are 30 and under and were largely inspired as kids by Kobe, much more than Michael Jordan, their father\u2019s hero. Bryant resonated with a young generation because he played in the air and on the ground. He scored and he defended. He won more than he lost. His flair was copied, his desire was envied, his accomplishments were incomprehensible to all but a legendary few. Mainly, Bryant endeared himself to the basketball world with his constant pursuit of greatness. In his 2018 book, The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, he wrote the following: \u201cDuring my rookie year, at first, some scouting reports said I wasn\u2019t tough. The first time I went to the basket in games, I\u2019d get hit and the defense would think they had me. I\u2019d come back the very next play and pick up an offensive foul just to send them a message. I didn\u2019t need that extra push to be great, though. From Day One, I wanted to dominate. My mindset was: I\u2019m going to figure you out. Whether it was AI, Tracy, Vince \u2014 or, if I were coming up today, LeBron, Russ, Steph \u2014 my goal was to figure you out. And to do that, to figure those puzzles out, I was willing to do way more than anyone else. That was the fun part for me.\u201d So the standard he set was no surprise. After a rookie season in which he spent dipping a toe in the NBA waters, Bryant was a force for the rest of his career, save for when he tore his Achilles during his twilight. He created moments where others saw impossible odds. He was an All-Star 18 times, won an MVP, added a pair of Olympic golds and never cheated fans in L.A. or elsewhere. When you paid money to see Kobe, you got a bargain. Kobe once said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anyone wouldn\u2019t want to be the best at whatever they do. Like, that\u2019s unfathomable to me. I\u2019m just not wired that way. I\u2019m coming for your throat and your head and whatever else I got to take to get what I came for.\u201d How many people in other professions prepared for their job better than Kobe for his? Bryant was an early riser who attacked fitness, ignored the pain that came with it, beat others to the gym and wouldn\u2019t leave until he reached his projected goals for that day. He wasn\u2019t shy about criticizing teammates he felt were cheating themselves and by extension, cheating him. Nobody was spared, not even fellow superstar Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Again: That\u2019s what elevated him beyond other greats. All talent being equal, Kobe made sure he simply wanted it more. Fans saw it on a nightly basis and it left an impression that was tattooed to their memory banks, even today. The death of Bryant, therefore, is a case study in hero worship and how a symbol of a generation can cause people who\u2019ve never met him to suddenly break from their normal routine and spill their emotions. Understand, Bryant was worth many hundreds of millions of dollars and carried traffic-stopping fame and won five championships, all far beyond the scope of the average person. Still, those tears \u2026 That\u2019s why the entire region aches and why Lakers basketball won\u2019t be the same for a while. Bryant\u2019s death had a unifying effect in L.A., bonding fans of all ethnic groups, walks of life and political persuasions. Such is the power of sports and the clout afforded to stars. They become bigger than the game and, in death, more mythical than ever before. Bryant brought joy to many as he relentlessly pushed the limits of his basketball ability. He also inspired, and that\u2019s why L.A. remains fractured by his death.  The Kobe worship knew no international boundaries \u2014 this much was made clear in the last few days \u2014 but the intensity is inescapable here in the city where he played for 20 years and won five championships. Bryant came to L.A. at 17, so the city saw him grow up and also grew up with him. He resonated in so many ways and through so many different neighborhoods, as a superstar, hard worker, winner, entertainer and father whose last act was taking his daughter to a travel basketball game. One of his final public appearances was at a December game at Staples, Lakers vs. Mavericks. Gigi was a fan of many players, including Luka Doncic. Father and daughter sat courtside, with the future Hall of Famer teaching her about the game and its players, and the teenage girl absorbing it all. When the Jumbotron caught Bryant, the cheers were deafening, as they always were when he made a rare appearance at his old home court. In a city of stars, Kobe Bryant was once again the center of attention. Now he\u2019s gone, and as it staggers forward, a deflated basketball town has only just begun to reckon with this unfathomable loss. *** Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Bryant, sized up unofficially by the NBA and its fans as someone who might be able to take the superstar\/champion\/celebrity baton from Jordan deep into the Chicago Bulls legend\u2019s career, did become a West Coast variation in purple and gold for the Los Angeles Lakers.  But for a minute, Bryant and the Bulls talked about literally making that happen. In the summer of 2004, with Bryant hitting free agency as the Phil Jackson-Shaquille O\u2019Neal-Bryant run of four Finals appearances unraveled, Chicago looked like a possible landing spot for the Lakers\u2019 then-25-year-old star. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and John Paxson, relatively new in retired GM Jerry Krause\u2019s role, flew to southern California to meet with Bryant. Paxson, currently the Bulls\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations, talked about that big-game safari Monday while sharing his thoughts and memories on Bryant\u2019s tragic death. Bryant, 41, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, Calif. \u201cThe things that always stand out to me after are, first of all, how smart a person he is and how mature he was even at that time,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cAnd in talking about coming to Chicago, remember, it was six years after Michael left and most guys didn\u2019t want to follow that or try to live up to that. \u201cWhat he expressed to us was, he wanted to embrace that if it happened. He wanted that challenge.\u201d The notion that more mortal NBA players don\u2019t want the burden of living up to Jordan\u2019s impossible standards gets tossed around to this day by some in and outside the organization as an excuse for the Bulls\u2019 limited appeal to free agents. Bryant, at least by what he told the Bulls\u2019 brass, was ready way back then to shoulder the mantle. Of course, he re-signed with L.A., the Lakers traded O\u2019Neal to alleviate that tension and Bryant led the Lakers to titles in 2009 and 2010 to significantly boost his legacy \u2013 while pulling within one ring of Jordan. Paxson, speaking to reporters two hours before the Spurs-Bulls game at United Center, said that Bulls players were shaken by Sunday\u2019s news. \u201cEvents like this show how connected people in sport can be, not only with a fan base but with those of us who are in the game,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to have the greatest type of connection but just the game itself means so much to people, and the respect that the great ones have.\u201d San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, whose team was playing its second game in as many nights since learning of Bryant\u2019s death, said he would hold dear \u2013 and keep details to himself \u2013 some personal moments he had shared with Bryant. But he added: \u201cWe all remember the on-court, but for me, the special parts will be the very few times I was able to spend time with him off the court, and have discussions with him just one-on-one.\u201d \u201cWe all have special thoughts of him to varying degrees, no matter if you knew him a little bit or not at all. Even the millions who admired him and cherished just knowing they could watch a game and, within minutes, you feel like he was your own. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re iconic and you\u2019re basically a superhero.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Her name was Gianna Maria Onore Bryant. The world, now and forever, knows her as Gigi. Her dad, Kobe Bryant, called her Mambacita. He was Mamba, of course, and she was going to be basketball\u2019s female version of him. She was going to play at Connecticut and head to the WNBA. That was the plan. Over the years, the world watched her grow from a babe in her father\u2019s arms, to a small child trying to hold his Finals MVP trophy to his companion at WNBA, college and NBA games around the country, listening to her father break down play and watching every detail on the court, just as he always did. \u201cGigi was really turning into a special player,\u201d said Russ Davis, the women\u2019s basketball coach at Vanguard University in Southern California and someone who became close with Bryant in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict her future, but with the way she was improving and the way she understood the game, she was going to have a bright one.\u201d Gigi was 13. She was one of the nine people, her father also among them, on the helicopter that crashed Sunday morning into a hillside in Calabasas, California, as the group made its way to a basketball tournament where she was supposed to be playing. The helicopter burst into flames. All nine \u2014 including two of her teammates \u2014 died, officials said. Kobe and Vanessa Bryant had four daughters. Gigi was the baller of the group. She was going to carry on the Bryant name in basketball. Few things in life made Bryant happier than that realization. \u201cI try to watch as much film as I can,\u201d Gigi said in an interview with Las Vegas CBS affiliate KLAS in 2019, when she and her dad attended the Las Vegas Aces\u2019 WNBA opener. \u201cMore information, more inspiration.\u201d She was even sounding like her dad. The film study was working. So, too, was the five- or six- or seven-times-a-week workouts that Bryant would host for Gigi and her teammates on the team he coached. They ran the triangle offense, the one where Bryant had so much success with during his career. Grown men, professionals, the best players in the world, struggled with the triangle. Bryant had pre-teen girls figuring it out. \u201cHe never yelled or anything,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey just listened to him.\u201d Earlier this month, Bryant posted a short video clip of Gigi in a game. The sequence: dribble-drive, pass to the corner, post up, wait for the ball to come back, catch, footwork, shoot the fadeaway. http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B7UTuPSHWOu\/ Her father\u2019s unstoppable fadeaway. She scored. Of course. \u201cGigi getting better every day,\u201d her dad wrote. Bryant and Gigi went to a UConn home game against Houston last March. Bryant wore a UConn shirt \u2014 just like Gigi was \u2014 and told SNY television during an in-game interview that he was thrilled that one of his daughters wanted to follow in his sneakers and take up the family basketball business. http:\/\/twitter.com\/UConnWBB\/status\/1221551301970055173 \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool. It\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cShe started out playing soccer, which I love. But she came to me about a year and a half ago and said, \u2018Can you teach me the game?\u2019 I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 We started working a little bit and the next thing you know it became a true passion of hers. So, it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Many of Gigi\u2019s favorite players had UConn ties, like Katie Lou Samuelson \u2014 she had played for Davis, which led to the initial connection between he and Bryant \u2014 and Gabby Williams. \u201cFrom what I saw,\u201d Williams said Monday, \u201cshe was going to be heaps better than me.\u201d Williams was floored when Gigi told her she was her favorite player. She would FaceTime with the Bryants before games, gave Gigi her Chicago Sky uniforms, even practiced with Gigi and her teammates and was blown away by how hard she had to play against them. \u201cShe had the right mentality, so confident, relentless, so mean and aggressive,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd then (she would) walk off the court with the biggest, sweetest smile on her face. But my favorite part about her was just seeing how much she loved the game and loved to learn. \u201cIt\u2019s intimidating to have to follow in those footsteps,\u201d Williams added, \u201cbut she really embraced it.\u201d The UConn allegiance made all the sense in the world. Bryant played in Los Angeles, but he was a Philadelphia guy. So is UConn coach Geno Auriemma, who was heartbroken by the news of the crash Sunday. UConn has been the gold standard in the women\u2019s college game for a generation, driven by excellence. Bryant identified with that quality. Jewell Loyd of the WNBA\u2019s Seattle Storm knew plenty about Gigi. Loyd sponsors an AAU team in Seattle. They played against Bryant\u2019s team, and over the years Loyd and Bryant forged an extremely special, extremely close bond. They looked at one another as family. Her description of Gigi? \u201cAwesome,\u201d Loyd said. \u201cWhen I went to work out with Kobe, most kids her age would be on the tablet,\u201d Loyd said. \u201cShe stayed still and watched the entire time. Didn\u2019t say anything. She was studying the game of basketball. If that didn\u2019t say Kobe, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d Even NBA players were impressed. Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young couldn\u2019t believe it when Bryant told him that Gigi was a huge fan of his and was trying to emulate parts of his game. So Young paid tribute Sunday by opening a Hawks game in a No. 8 jersey, before switching back to his customary No. 11. Afterward, Young recalled some of his final conversation with Bryant. \u201cHe said how proud he was of me and how he wants me to continue to be a role model for kids growing up, for Gigi,\u201d Young said. There were similarities in how father and daughter looked \u2014 the dark, piercing eyes, especially \u2014 but Loyd also saw similarities in the way father and daughter played the game. Both, she said, were methodical. Both were willing to outwork their opponents. Gigi knew who her father was and knew that meant a lot of eyeballs would be on her, that comparisons between her and her dad on the court were going to be inevitable. Gigi didn\u2019t care, either. She wanted to be like Dad. \u201cThat\u2019s his legacy,\u201d Loyd said. That\u2019s now Gigi\u2019s legacy as well."},{"id":29104,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-week-14-damian-lillard-pascal-siakam","date":"2020-01-27","title":"Damian Lillard, Pascal Siakam named NBA Players of the Week","content":" Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard and Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam were named NBA Players of the Week for Week 14.
