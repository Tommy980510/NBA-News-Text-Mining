Backup center Marquese Chriss suffered a broken bone in his right leg and an ankle injury in practice Saturday and there is no timetable for his return, the Warriors confirmed Sunday in an injury update. The injury was first reported by Shams Charania of The Athletic. Chriss underwent an MRI for what is called a \u201cright syndesmosis ankle injury with a fibular fracture,\u201d and he consulted with an orthopedist last night, according to the Warriors. He will undergo surgery in the coming days and a timeline for his return will be established at that point. The center, 23, who suffered the injury during a scrimmage, has appeared in two games with the Warriors this season, averaging 6.5 points and 6.5 rebounds. Chriss played 14 minutes in the Warriors\u2019 138-99 loss to the Bucks on Christmas Day, scoring four points. In the Warriors\u2019 season opener on Dec. 22, Chriss scored nine points in 12 minutes in the Warriors\u2019 125-99 loss to the Nets. The loss of Chriss means that No. 2 overall Draft pick James Wiseman, the starting center, and center Kevon Looney will be logging more playing time. The 6-foot-9 center appeared in 59 games with Golden State last season, averaging career-high figures in scoring (9.3), rebounding (6.2) and blocked shots (1.05). A four-year NBA veteran, Chriss was originally selected by the Sacramento Kings in the first round of the 2016 NBA Draft (8th overall)."},{"id":460637,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-december-27","date":"2020-12-27","title":"FanDuel DFS Values of the Night: December 27","content":"See below for a breakdown of value plays for tonight\u2019s slate of games on Fan Duel by FantasyPros . Stephen Curry (GS) at CHI: $8,300 Curry and the Warriors have gotten off to a slow start but this is a great bounceback spot for the former MVP. We\u2019ll discuss that more later. Dejounte Murray (SAN) at NOP: $7,300 Murray looked like a star in the opener and it appears he\u2019s going to play a much bigger role for the Spurs this year. We love that against an up-tempo Pelicans team. Markelle Fultz (ORL) at WAS: $5,900 Fultz never amazes in the stat sheet but his stat-stuffing ways are very intriguing against a Wizards team who had the worst defense in the NBA last season. Zach LaVine (CHI) vs. GS: $7,000 The Warriors have been the worst defense the first two games and that\u2019s bad news against a stud like LaVine. Eric Bledsoe (NOP) vs. SAN: $5,600 Bledsoe is simply too cheap, as he could easily provide 30-40 FanDuel points. That\u2019d make him a huge value at this price tag. Donte DiVincenzo (MIL) at NYK: $4,900 DD has earned a starting role for the Bucks, averaging 26 FD points per game in his first two fixtures. DeMar DeRozan (SAN) at NOP: $8,100 DeRozan flirted with a triple-double in the opener and could be another great option for San Antonio against this poor defense. Gordon Hayward (CHA) vs. BRK: $7,200 Hayward signed with Charlotte to be the man and 28 points, four rebounds and seven assists in the opener would indicate that he\u2019s just that. Kelly Oubre Jr. (GS) at CHI: $6,000 Oubre has been terrible the first two games but the usage is still there. That\u2019s great news with his price tag dropping and this great matchup against Chicago. Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL) at NYK: $11,500 Giannis is probably the best pure points play on the board and we\u2019ll discuss that in the studs section. Lauri Markkanen (CHI) vs. GS: $6,400 We love the Bulls against this putrid Warriors defense and that includes a cheap Markkanen. Larry Nance Jr. (CLE) vs. PHI: $6,500 With Kevin Love possibly sitting in the second half of a back-to-back, Nance could start and play 30 minutes in his spot. Nikola Vucevic (ORL) at WAS: $8,299 Vooch wrecked Washington last season, averaging over 50 FD points per game in three matchups against them. Wendell Carter (CHI) vs. GS: $4,900 Carter is probably the best value against this bad Warriors defense and would be one of the best values out there if he provides the double-double that I anticipate. Bismack Biyombo (CHA) vs. BRK: $4,500 Biyombo is now the starter with Cody Zeller injured and he provided 25 FanDuel points per game in this role last season.

The step-back 3, the defense-breaking dimes, the relentless march to the free throw line. All of it was there for Harden, who appeared unfazed by the recent noise surrounding him and his revamped franchise. It caught Portland off guard. Maybe they weren\u2019t expecting Harden and Houston\u2019s season debut \u2014 initially postponed after positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing protocols \u2014 to be so seamless. Several Rockets \u2014 including John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins \u2014 remained unavailable while under quarantine, leaving just nine active players to contend with a much deeper Blazers team. Portland fell behind by as many as 16 in the second quarter. Harden was humming. Houston\u2019s big free agent signing, Christian Wood, was dunking all over the Blazers\u2019 finally healthy frontline. Jae\u2019Sean Tate \u2014 last seen playing for the Sydney Kings of Australia\u2019s National Basketball League \u2014 scored 11 points on perfect 4-for-4 shooting in the first half. Surely the Blazers needed Damian Lillard to, at least, duplicate his 21 first-half points. It didn\u2019t happen. Lillard went unusually cold, shooting just 3-for-12 in the second half. He even missed the potential game-winner in regulation, a one-on-one leaner over PJ Tucker. With Harden scorching, what would the Blazers do without Dame Time? Turn the clock to McCollum\u2019s Meridian. For each of Harden\u2019s absurd step-back triples, the other half of Portland\u2019s high-scoring backcourt answered with a 3 of his own. And another. And another. McCollum drilled a career-high nine of them, including the game-winning bomb with 6.3 seconds remaining in overtime to give Portland a thrilling 128-126 victory. His 44 points canceled out Harden\u2019s own 44, as well as Houston\u2019s absurdly shorthanded bid for a road win at Portland. \u201cI know, based on some of the things we\u2019re going through right now offensively and defensively, we have to play well,\u201d McCollum said afterward . We have to be efficient, I need to make threes, I need to take threes, just try to be aggressive.\u201d The extremely early candidate for the game of the year punctuated the gorge-like difference between each team\u2019s contending philosophy. Portland has stayed the course behind its star backcourt for more than seven years, refusing to break up the Lillard-McCollum tandem. They are synonymous with Portland, all but assured of lofty places in franchise record books and memories. Houston, on the other hand, is attempting a fourth co-star audition alongside Harden, one that won\u2019t be televised until Wall is cleared to return. Even when he does, there is no guarantee the former No. 1 pick will be the All-Star package of playmaking athleticism he once was ( preseason signs were encouraging). Can Wall be the answer where Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook left only more questions? Even if Wall does make a successful on-court return, the question of Harden\u2019s desire to see through its potential remains. Most recent reports have him extending his list of preferred destinations rather than his time in Houston. His late arrival to Rockets camp intensified that uncertainty. Heading into Saturday\u2019s game, Harden answered pregame questions about his delayed season debut with a short, pre-scripted litany. \u201cTonight, I got a great opportunity,\u201d Harden said. \u201cStarting my 12th year in this league. I\u2019m excited for it.\u201d Another question about recent events. Same answer. \u201cYear 12 for me,\u201d Harden deadpanned. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be out here playing. You never want to take playing basketball for granted. I\u2019m excited for tonight\u2019s game.\u201d All of that could have taken at least a temporary backseat had Saturday\u2019s headline been \u201cHarden returns, scores 44 in Rockets\u2019 opener.\u201d Instead, it was McCollum\u2019s 44 that stole the victory and relief from Houston\u2019s complicated start to the 2020-21 campaign. There is little time to dwell on it. Houston faces the formidable Nuggets on Monday ( 9 ET, League Pass ) again without Wall, Cousins and others due to mandated quarantines. The Blazers travel to face the defending champion Lakers later that same night ( 10 ET, NBA TV ). Portland will enter its game secure in who they are and will be for the foreseeable future. The Rockets? They\u2019ll wait at least long enough to see what their full squad looks like before deciding if Houston has a problem. Three regular starters \u2014 Harden, PJ Tucker and Christian Wood \u2014 logged more than 40 minutes apiece. Tate, David Nwaba and Danuel House combined for more than 100 minutes. \u201cFor those guys to come in and play the minutes they did against a quality team and be right there at the end, I\u2019m proud of them,\u201d said first-year Rockets head coach Stephen Silas. \u201cI\u2019m proud of them. I\u2019m proud of the way they fought.\u201d As for Harden, he described his 44-point, 17-assist return as casually as he made it. \u201cI didn\u2019t surprise myself at all,\u201d Harden said postgame . \u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d What nobody knows is what Harden or the Rockets will do next."},{"id":459891,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/doc-rivers-climbs-to-10th-on-all-time-coaching-regular-season-wins-list","date":"2020-12-27","title":"Doc Rivers climbs to 10th in career coaching wins","content":"Doc Rivers\u2019 new chapter in Philadelphia begins with an achievement that recognized the path that led him there. The former NBA point guard and 22-year head coach earned his 945th career coaching win on Saturday when the 76ers dispatched the Knicks, 109-89 . The victory pushed Rivers past Hall-of-Famer Bill Fitch for 10th on the all-time coaching regular season wins list, with the men ahead of him all having cleared the 1,000-win mark. The achievement came at the expense of the Knicks, the team Rivers played for during their 1994 Finals run. Rivers, whose head coaching experience began in Orlando in 1999, has won at least half his games in all but three seasons in that role. He earned a championship ring and pair of 60-win seasons during his time with the Boston Celtics before helping turn the LA Clippers into a perennial Western Confernece contender. After reaching a mutual decision to leave the Clippers this past offseason, Rivers was hired by Philadelphia to engineer a more successful approach around All-Star talents Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.

There are at least 70 more 2020-21 games to resolve that, but for now, here\u2019s some Warriors footage of the former two-time Kia MVP making not one, not two, but 105 3-pointers in a row during practice: Per the Warriors, Curry\u2019s absurd hot streak endured more than five minutes before human error finally surfaced. Curry, the NBA record-holder for most 3s made in a season (402), played just five games due to injury last season and is leading a Warriors team missing Klay Thompson (torn Achilles). Golden State will likely need real-game performances that hint at what he\u2019s doing in practice to stay afloat in the competitive Western Conference. The Warriors said they captured the final 103 on video at the Bulls\u2019 practice facility. Curry\u2019s shots were counted by his longtime shooting man, assistant Bruce Fraser, and coach Steve Kerr only heard about his shooting star afterward. Curry finally missed, then pumped his arms and yelled in delight. \u201cI think his previous record was 77. That\u2019s insane,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Guinness Book of World Records still exists. That was one of my favorite books growing up. If it still exists that should go in the book, because we have video evidence now apparently.\u201d You bet, two-time MVP Curry can still dazzle day after day at age 32 and at the start of his 12th NBA season. With his next made 3, Curry will have 2,500 for his career \u2014 joining only Ray Allen and Reggie Miller to reach that mark. \u201cIt was SO amazing \u2014 105 3s in a row. I knew it could be special around 30. Just amazing,\u201d Fraser said by text, then added: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything about the one he missed. I was actually more focused on just delivering good passes. I was nervous! Haha. Yes, lots of swishes.\u201d Draymond Green didn\u2019t witness the all-out downpour, but he is plenty confident in Curry\u2019s count. \u201cI have zero doubt that he did it. I don\u2019t need to watch a video to see how they went in, any of that,\u201d Green said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve always said, obviously the greatest shooter I think to ever play this game. As great as that is, I can\u2019t sit here and act like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m surprised.\u2019 It\u2019s just not really surprising to me. It\u2019s such an incredible thing but I\u2019m sorry, Steph, it doesn\u2019t really get me up out of my seat that he hit 105 in a row, \u2019cause if you said anyone\u2019s going to hit 105 3s in a row, my guess would be Steph. He\u2019s capable of it.

He helped convince many who had never voted to finally head to the polls. He found more ways to continue elevating the lives of people in his hometown. If that weren\u2019t enough, he won another NBA championship. James\u2019 on-court performance this year was spectacular again. A fourth NBA title and fourth NBA Finals MVP trophy were his, as he lifted the Los Angeles Lakers back atop the basketball world. And after a year where he was brilliant, on the court and off, James was announced Saturday as the winner of The Associated Press \u2019 Male Athlete of the Year award for a record-tying fourth time. \u201cI still know what I do on the floor and obviously, I give everything to the game,\u201d James told AP. \u201cBut I can make a greater impact off the floor right now, more than I can on the floor. And I want to continue to inspire people with the way I play the game of basketball. But there\u2019s so many more things that I can do off the floor to help cultivate people, inspire people, bring people together, empower them.\u201d The AP award was first given out in 1931. James\u2019 fourth win matched Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods for the most by men. Three women have won the AP award at least four times; Babe Didrikson was a six-time winner, Serena Williams has won five and Chris Evert four. The AP \u2019s Female Athlete of the Year will be announced Sunday. No NBA player scored more points or had more assists in 2020 than James. The only other player in his lifetime to lead the league in points and assists in the same calendar year? Himself, in 2018. James also became the first player to be NBA Finals MVP for three franchises. He moved past Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time scoring list, doing so one day before Bryant died last January in a helicopter crash; the last tweet Bryant sent was a congratulatory message to James. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest player the basketball universe has ever seen,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of James in October. \u201cAnd if you think you know, you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re around him every day, you\u2019re coaching him, you\u2019re seeing his mind, you\u2019re seeing his adjustments, seeing the way he leads the group. You think you know. You don\u2019t know.\u201d James finished with 78 points in voting by a panel of 35 AP customers and editors. Kansas City quarterback and reigning Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes was a narrow second with 71 points. Formula One seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was a distant third with 14 points. James \u2014 also the AP \u2019s male athlete of this past decade \u2014 also won the yearly AP award in 2013, 2016 and 2018. Michael Jordan, a three-time winner, is the only other basketball player to win the AP award more than once. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest leaders in sports,\u201d Lakers guard Kyle Kuzma said of James. That applies on and off the court. James\u2019 More Than A Vote organization drew more than 42,000 volunteers to work at polling stations for the November election, helped some earn back their voting rights and pushed for turnout among Black and young voters. Black voters made up 11% of the national electorate, and 9 in 10 of them supported President-elect Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide. When compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden drew more voters in critical areas with large Black populations \u2014 such as NBA cities like Detroit, Milwaukee and Atlanta. That proved massive. \u201cThe tragic death of George Floyd, everyone getting a chance to see that, and also hearing the story of Breonna Taylor, her tragic story, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia \u2026 my people have had enough and I have had enough,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I called for action and with my platform, I believed I could get people to join me.\u201d He also focused, as always, on his hometown of Akron, Ohio. The I PROMISE School he opened in 2018 now has over 450 students in third through sixth grades. When the pandemic shut down then school, James and his team ensured students got hot meals delivered to their homes \u2014 even complete Thanksgiving meals. An affordable housing project for 50 families broke ground this year. And this month, plans for House Three Thirty (a nod to Akron\u2019s area code) were announced, detailing how James is going to offer things like accessible family financial health programming, job training and a community gathering space. \u201cThe pandemic has been rough on all of us,\u201d James said. \u201cNo matter your situation, no matter where you are in life, it\u2019s been rough. And the first thing I thought about, besides the stoppage of the season, when the pandemic hit was \u2018What am I going to do for my kids back in my back in my school?\u2019\u201d He is already eyeing 2021. The Lakers expect to be contenders again. His remake of \u201cSpace Jam\u201d is expected to be released this summer. And James, who turns 36 Wednesday, hasn\u2019t ruled out playing again for USA Basketball in the Tokyo Olympics on the team that will be coached by Gregg Popovich. \u201cIt\u2019s still possible,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a 0% percent chance, I will say that. I love Coach Pop.\u201d But, as 2020 wound down, James allowed himself a moment to reflect on a year like none other. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the people that I work with, to the people at my foundation, to the sponsors that continue to support us and what we do and what we strive for,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I can\u2019t sit here and say that at the time we stopped in March that I thought all this would happen and we would be at this point in December.\u201d Yet here he is, again."},{"id":459458,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-love-back-for-cavs-after-missing-opener-with-calf-injury","date":"2020-12-26","title":"Kevin Love back for Cavs after missing opener with calf injury","content":"DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Kevin Love will be back in Cleveland\u2019s starting lineup Saturday night against the Pistons after missing the season opener with a calf injury.

The club designated John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Mason Jones and Eric Gordon as out due to \u201chealth and safety protocols,\u201d and listed rookie Kenyon Martin Jr. and Ben McLemore as out \u201cself isolating.\u201d That leaves the Rockets with nine players available for Saturday\u2019s contest at Portland, one more than the league\u2019s minimum eight players required to play an NBA game. Houston looks to hit the court for the first time this season after the league postponed the Rockets\u2019 season opener against Oklahoma City on Wednesday because they lacked the minimum number of available players required to field a game-day roster with six of them advancing through COVID-19 protocols. The latest development won\u2019t affect the availability of Rockets star guard James Harden, however. Although the league ruled Harden out for the season opener and issued a $50,000 fine due to violation of the league\u2019s health and safety protocols, the guard fulfilled all the requirements of the NBA\u2019s medical staff, which required him to quarantine for four days and produce four daily negative tests for coronavirus before he could be cleared to return. He will be active for the team\u2019s first game. \u201cYear 12 for me,\u201d Harden said, dodging questions about the NBA\u2019s ruling. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be out here playing. You never want to take playing basketball for granted. So, I\u2019m excited for tonight\u2019s game.\u201d Harden\u2019s $50,000 fine stemmed from a video published Tuesday on Black Sports Online that showed the Rockets star attending a party at a night club unmasked, which led to a review of the footage by the club and the NBA to determine whether he violated the league\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. The NBA\u2019s coronavirus protocols prohibit players from attending social gatherings of more than 15 people, as well as bars, lounges and clubs. The protocols state that failure or refusal to comply could lead to disciplinary action by the NBA or the team, and could include a warning, fines and\/or suspension, in addition to education or training sessions. Harden initially posted an explanation to his Instagram story Wednesday, but that post was later deleted. \u201cOne thing after another,\u201d Harden posted. \u201cI went to show my homegirl love at her event (not a strip club) because she is becoming a boss and putting her people in position of success and now it\u2019s a problem. Everyday it\u2019s something different. No matter how many times people try to drag my name under you can\u2019t. The real always end on top.\u201d Multiple outlets have reported that Harden has requested a trade from the Rockets. Harden arrived at the team\u2019s training camp on Dec. 8, but he wasn\u2019t cleared to work out with the squad until he produced negative tests for COVID-19 on six consecutive days. As Harden advanced through the NBA\u2019s coronavirus protocols, he missed the team\u2019s first two exhibition outings against the Chicago Bulls. Harden remains under contract in Houston for at least the next two seasons with a player option in 2022."},{"id":458852,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-christmas-day-takeaways-eruptions-and-anticipated-debuts","date":"2020-12-26","title":"NBA Christmas Day takeaways: Eruptions and anticipated debuts","content":"Five games, featuring the reigning two-time Kia MVP, the defending champs, the No. 2 pick in the draft, a team from New York City (no, not that one \u2014 the other one ) and the previous year\u2019s No. 1 pick.

The Heat are such a balanced and cohesive group that there\u2019s no need to lean on any single player. Try finding another elite team with Miami\u2019s makeup. Duncan Robinson helped build a massive lead by making six 3-pointers in the first half and connected on 7-for-13 for the game, tying the Christmas Day record Brandon Ingram set in 2019. The usual suspects \u2014 Goran Dragic, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro \u2014 had strong stretches. Newcomer Avery Bradley (12 points, solid D) is buying into the program. And Miami won by 13, displaying the same elements that helped them reach the NBA Finals a few months ago. Miami is a T-E-A-M. Zion Williamson and Ingram combined for 60 points but faded in the fourth quarter, going without a basket until the last few minutes; by then the score escaped them. Despite that, they\u2019re forwards who can create their own shots, mesh well and are decent defensively. The issue for the Pelicans is how and when they upgrade the backcourt here in the first year without Jrue Holiday. Lonzo Ball got a no-vote of confidence when the club didn\u2019t extend his rookie deal. JJ Redick is 36. Eric Bledsoe wasn\u2019t wanted by the Bucks. Those players shot 5-for-25 with nine turnovers combinedx. Interestingly, the Pelicans could\u2019ve drafted Tyler Herro (taken No. 13 by Miami) with the 2019 fourth pick received from the Lakers in the Anthony Davis trade, but GM David Griffin swapped it for No. 8 Jaxson Hayes and 17 Nickeil Alexander-Walker, two players at the back end of the rotation. The Stephen Curry-James Wiseman pick and roll could quickly develop into an elite-level option. Let\u2019s put aside momentarily how the Warriors have resembled a last-place team again in this very, very small sample size of 2020-21. And also acknowledge the 0-2 record is courtesy of East heavyweights Brooklyn and Milwaukee. And mention Kelly Oubre Jr. and Andrew Wiggins have been straight duds, Oubre struggling mightily with his jumper (1-for-10 Friday) while Wiggins can\u2019t shake those head-scratching plays that feed into the perception he\u2019s an underachiever. Yes, put all that aside for another day because of James Wiseman (18 points, eight rebounds, three blocks). The early showing by the rookie 7-footer is very encouraging, and remember, he didn\u2019t play at all in the preseason and his entire college career at Memphis lasted about five minutes. That\u2019s a lot of down time, making what he\u2019s doing all the more impressive. The 19-year-old big man shows no wariness or intimidation, what you want from a No. 2 overall pick (\u201cThe game is starting to slow down for me,\u201d he said). He had moments against Brook Lopez, a second-team All-Defensive center last season, keeping the Bucks\u2019 big on alert. Until the Warriors get themselves together \u2014 and that might not happen until next season when Klay Thompson returns \u2014 the development of Wiseman will be the key to the season and, by extension, the future. Meanwhile, it\u2019s apparent the Bucks made a mistake giving Giannis Antetokounmpo that contract extension. After missing the game-tying free throw in the opener against Boston and then following up with a \u201cmeh\u201d performance Friday, he\u2019s obviously \u2026 OK, we joke. If anything, Giannis should feel even better about his team two games into the season, because the Bucks have covered for his sloppy start. Khris Middleton (31 points in 26 minutes) was a Grinch to Golden State and newcomers Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis are making their arrivals felt. Obviously, Giannis will get back to pulling the load. That said, there\u2019s still the lingering sight of Giannis missing jumpers from 20 feet and beyond. This was an issue in the Orlando bubble, and even with defenders slacking off and giving him space, Giannis\u2019 range remains a work in progress. He missed all three of his 3-pointers against the Warriors and is now 3-for-11 on the season \u2014 not terrible, yet not reassuring, either. You wonder if the Bucks, who sing the gospel of the three-pointer, will mention to Giannis that a mid-range jumper is OK, that not everyone has to stretch the floor. Of course, that would be a radical and original thought here in today\u2019s copycat NBA, so never mind. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant combined for 66 points against the Celtics. Attention, Eastern Conference contenders: This is now the deal when you get the Nets. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving taking star turns and ownership of possessions, quarters and halves, maybe entire games, at their whim. As if their individual skills and shot-making weren\u2019t enough, they\u2019ve apparently taken a liking to the offense flavored by Nets assistant coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, one of the most influential offensive minds of modern-day hoops. The Nets\u2019 top assistant is likely thanking the basketball gods that he\u2019s away from the chaos in Houston and working for a club where star chemistry isn\u2019t a problem, at least so far. Kyrie, scoring 37 points, ruled in a Christmas Day game that didn\u2019t include Kemba Walker on the other side. And KD (29 points) jump-started the Nets\u2019 romp by going into his bag for layups and jumpers. They combined to shoot 10-for-14 from deep. And for the second time in two games, the Nets won by blowout. They\u2019re a team with a pair of championship-proven stars and very good complimentary players and a system that caters to their talent. Until proven otherwise, they\u2019re your favorites in the East. Yes, Kemba is hurt, didn\u2019t play and could be out another few weeks, so let\u2019s concede as much. That said, the Celtics don\u2019t appear to be better than last season, and that\u2019s a problem when Milwaukee improved (notably adding Jrue Holiday) and Brooklyn really did, tacking on a healthy Irving and Durant. After taking this Christmas whipping, do the Celtics pause and reassess and explore the possibility of adding James Harden to the mix? Sure, that would represent the nuclear option, essentially admitting the current crew won\u2019t get it done this summer. Jayson Tatum remains a rising superstar, Jaylen Brown has continued to improve, and yet Danny Ainge has some thinking to do: the GM lost Gordon Hayward last offseason and lacks a proven post player. Is Boston truly better than the Bucks, Nets, Sixers or Heat? With a shortened schedule, contending teams must make quicker judgments than usual with regard to making changes by the trade deadline. And Harden represents a major, major change. The Lakers cruise to their first win of the season with a win over the Mavericks. The last time Montrezl Harrell faced the Mavericks, he played poorly and made an off-color remark to Luka Doncic that forced an apology \u2014 the beginning of a value collapse on the free agent market. That playoff series, and the next equally bad one against the Nuggets, in the Orlando bubble seemed to expose Harrell as a poor defender and shooter. Teams cooled on him, the Clippers didn\u2019t even attempt to re-sign him, and the Kia NBA Sixth Man award-winner settled on a two-year contract for $19 million with the Lakers (by comparison, Jerami Grant got three years and $60 million with Detroit). But Harrell has been beastly so far this season, and was a far different player Friday in a rematch with the Mavericks. He scored 22 points on 10-for-13 shooting with seven rebounds in 28 minutes. With Dennis Schroder adding 18 points and six assists, the Lakers\u2019 offseason is looking better and better. In Dallas, there\u2019s no timetable for the return of Kristaps Porzingis after meniscus surgery, although January seems possible. The Mavericks won\u2019t rush their 7-foot-3 co-star back, especially given his injury history, which means Doncic will go solo for a bit longer. That could prove costly in a 72-game season, during which the Mavs can\u2019t afford a mediocre stretch and expect a playoff spot, especially given the stiff competition in the West. Doncic racked up 27 points and seven assists against the Lakers and looked reasonably well, but there\u2019s a big drop-off between Porzingis and the third-best Mavericks player, who\u2019s either Tim Hardaway Jr. or Josh Richardson, neither of whom hurt the Lakers or has been an All-Star. The Mavericks were one of the teams harmed by Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s decision to re-sign in Milwaukee; Dallas hedged on adding more pieces last offseason, hoping to keep their cap clear for Giannis next summer, but now there needs to be a change in plans. In order to be taken seriously as a title threat, they\u2019ll require a third star or at least some upgrades among the supporting cast, and that help might not arrive this year. The Clippers had reason to collapse, much like Kawhi Leonard did after getting elbowed to the jaw by Serge Ibaka with six minutes left. That\u2019s because their lead went from 24 points to 11, Kawhi was done for the night, and this is just a few months removed from The Real Collapse in the Orlando bubble. But what the Clippers did was score a mentally refreshing win Friday, given how wrecked they were from losing a 3-1 lead to Denver in the playoffs. So far, so good this season for the 2-0 Clippers, who are still without the injured Marcus Morris but showing the ball movement and poise that coach Ty Lue wants from this crew. Look, that collapse in the playoffs will haunt them until they make amends, not in the regular season, but when the postseason rolls around again. Between now and then, the best the Clippers can do is achieve these mini-goals and position themselves for larger ones come springtime. The Nuggets, meanwhile, were worried about Jamal Murray for roughly six quarters: the four he played in the opener, when he scored just one basket against the Kings; and the first two Friday, when he matched that field goal total. Murray finally found his rhythm by late third quarter and finished with 23 points. But if he plans to be in the conversation for an All-NBA team, especially given how he scorched Earth and scored 40 or more points in three playoff elimination games last summer, he needs to remain at a consistently high level. The Nuggets will need that after losing a pair of rotation players in Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee, while also waiting to see if Michael Porter Jr. is for real. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Jones dies at 88","content":"BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Basketball Hall of Famer K.C. Jones, an Olympic gold medalist and two-time NCAA champion who won eight straight NBA titles during the Celtics\u2019 Bill Russell era and then coached the Boston teams with Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish to two more championships in the 1980s, has died. He was 88. The Celtics said Jones\u2019 family confirmed Friday that he died at an assistant living facility in Connecticut, where he had been receiving care for Alzheimer\u2019s disease for the past several years. Jones joined with Bill Russell to lead San Francisco to back-to-back NCAA championships in 1955-56. The two also played on the U.S. team that won the Olympic gold medal at the 1956 Games in Melbourne. A second-round draft choice by the Celtics, Jones reunited with Russell to win eight straight NBA titles from 1959-66. He retired in 1967 and began coaching, first in college at Brandeis and Harvard before joining the Los Angeles Lakers as an assistant, in 1971-72, where he earned another championship ring. He was an assistant coach on the Celtics team that won it all in 1981 before guiding the team led by Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish to the 1984 and \u201986 championships. \u201cK.C. was the nicest man I ever met. He always went out of his way to make people feel good, it was such an honor to play for him,\u201d Bird said in a statement. \u201cHis accomplishments are too many to list, but, to me, his greatest accomplishment was being such an outstanding person to all who had the privilege of knowing him, I will miss him dearly.\u201d The Celtics released the following statement: \u201cWhere K.C. Jones went, winning was sure to follow. K.C. \u2014 his given name \u2014 was a twelve-time NBA champion as player and coach, a two-time NCAA champion, and a Gold medal-winning Olympian and Hall of Famer. In NBA history, only teammates Bill Russell and Sam Jones have more championship rings during their playing careers. K.C. along with Russell, Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner, Earvin \u201cMagic \u201cJohnson and Michael Jordan, are the only players in history to achieve basketball\u2019s \u201cTriple Crown\u201d \u2014 winning an NCAA Championship, an NBA Championship and an Olympic Gold Medal. His number 25 has hung from the rafters since 1967. \u201cK.C.\u2019s coaching career was similarly illustrious. He was named to lead the Celtics in 1983, beginning what is one of the most remarkable head coaching runs the NBA has seen. K.C. helmed the Celtics for two of the most memorable seasons in the team\u2019s rich history, first leading the team to a championship in 1984 over the Lakers during a peak of that storied rivalry. Two seasons later, he led what many consider the greatest team in NBA history, the 1986 Champion Boston Celtics. These were the highlights of an astonishing four consecutive seasons in the NBA Finals, one of the most impressive and beloved Celtics eras. \u201cK.C. also demonstrated that one could be both a fierce competitor and a gentleman in every sense of the word. He made his teammates better, and he got the most out of the players he coached. Never one to seek credit, his glory was found in the most fundamental of basketball ideals \u2013 being part of a winning team. The Celtics family mourns his loss, as we celebrate his remarkable career and life.\u201d  Jones is one of seven players in history to have won an Olympic gold medal, an NCAA championship and an NBA title. He won two more NBA crowns as an assistant coach and was the Celtics head coach when they went to the NBA Finals four straight years from 1984-87, winning it all in \u201984 and again two years later with a team that won a then-record 67 regular-season games and went 15-3 in the postseason. Only Russell and fellow Celtics teammate Sam Jones won more NBA championships as players. Jones is the third Hall of Famer from the 1965 NBA champions to die this year: John Thompson, who went on to greater success as the coach at Georgetown, died in August, and Celtics player and coach Tommy Heinsohn died last month. Two days after observing a moment of silence for Heinsohn before their season opener, the Celtics had another for Jones on Friday. \u201cHe was a great coach to work for. He was a class act, and yet he had this competitive edge that was fierce,\u201d said current Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, who played for the team from 1981-88, when Jones was an assistant and then head coach. \u201cHe had this gentleness and kindness. He was a great leader of men,\u201d Ainge said before Friday\u2019s game. \u201cI looked at him as a mentor, and a friend. Much more than a coach.\u201d A point guard who excelled on defense, Jones joined with Russell to lead San Francisco to back-to-back NCAA championships in 1955-56. The two also played on the U.S. team that won the Olympic gold medal at the 1956 Games in Melbourne. Jones reunited with Russell in Boston to win eight straight NBA titles from 1959-66. Jones retired in 1967 and began coaching, first in college at Brandeis and Harvard before joining the Los Angeles Lakers as an assistant, where he earned another NBA championship ring in 1972. He had head coaching stints with the San Diego Conquistadors of the ABA and led the Washington Bullets to the 1975 NBA Finals. After a stop in Milwaukee, Jones returned to Boston in 1978 and won his 10th NBA title as an assistant on Bill Fitch\u2019s staff in 1981. He took over for Fitch in 1984 and over the next five seasons never won fewer than 57 games or failed to reach the Eastern Conference finals. Ainge said Jones was misunderstood and underappreciated because he was more laid back than some of his predecessors and thus less often mentioned among the great Celtics coaches like Red Auerbach, Heinsohn and Fitch. \u201cPeople are always looking for the people that are seeking that attention in front of the cameras. K.C. was fine with everybody else getting the attention and not much being focused on him,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to do it very often \u2014 and he didn\u2019t do it very often \u2014 but when the time came to take a stand, he would go toe-to-toe with the Hall of Fame players on our team.\u201d Jones\u2019 No. 25 was retired by the Celtics in 1967, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1989."},{"id":458224,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-exits-game-vs-pelicans","date":"2020-12-25","title":"Heat's Jimmy Butler (ankle) exits game vs. Pelicans, does not return","content":"Miami Heat guard Jimmy Butler has been ruled out for the remainder of the Christmas Day matinee against the New Orleans Pelicans, the team announced.

The league was still reviewing to see if any other quarantine decisions were needed for other Rockets players. Harden was fined $50,000 on Wednesday by the NBA, which said he violated protocols. The league prohibits attending indoor social gatherings of 15 or more people or entering bars, lounges, clubs or similar establishments. Video of the disgruntled star surfaced on social media, where he was shown without a mask at a crowded party in a private event space Monday night.

His Christmas debut is a great way to kick things off. But Stan Van Gundy\u2019s bringing a deep Pelicans team to his old stomping grounds to challenge the reigning Eastern Conference champions. Brandon Ingram led the way (24 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds) in the Pelicans\u2019 impressive season-opening win over Toronto. And it\u2019s Ingram, who will continue to serve as the Pelicans\u2019 go-to-scorer until Zion polishes his skills and becomes a more versatile threat. The Heat will counter with a burgeoning Big 3 of Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic (20 points and 7 assists off the bench in Wednesday\u2019s season-opening loss to Orlando). The Heat need to clean up the turnovers that (22 total and 13 combined from Adebayo and Butler) that led to 24 Magic points. The turnovers and the absence of the Heat\u2019s usual hustle are issues that Heat coach Erik Spoelstra won\u2019t allow to continue. Keep an eye on: The starting point guard matchup between Lonzo Ball and Tyler Herro. Ball didn\u2019t secure a contract extension, making this a show and prove year for the former No. 2 overall pick. Herro showed how much he enjoys the big stage as a rookie in the Orlando bubble. Golden State Warriors vs. Milwaukee Bucks, 2:30 ET (ABC) Any time you can get the last two players to win back-to-back Kia MVPs on the same court, it\u2019s must-see-TV. Both Steph Curry and his Warriors and Giannis Antetokounmpo and his Bucks have been humbled the past two seasons, injuries and a playoff absence for the former and back-to-back playoff flameouts for the latter. The Warriors got routed in their season opener against Brooklyn and despite his usual wicked overall performance, The Greek Freak came up short in a loss to Boston Wednesday night. Someone gets a chance to get off the snide with a win. While the Bucks remain among the best teams in the league, the Warriors will have to scratch and claw their way to get back into the playoff mix without Klay Thompson available this season and so many youngsters on the roster. Keep an eye on: Warriors rookie James Wiseman\u2019s baptism continues. He acquitted himself just fine against Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets on opening night. Now he\u2019ll get a relentless dose of the furious style of Antetokounmpo. Welcome to the NBA rook! Brooklyn Nets vs. Boston Celtics, 5 ET (ABC) They tussled in the preseason. But now these two contenders and rivals can get down to the serious business of who owns the Atlantic Division, and perhaps the Eastern Conference this season. Jayson Tatum had no problem facing up the reigning Kia MVP and Defensive Player of the Year Giannis Antetokounmpo to secure the first win of the season. So you know he won\u2019t shy away from a matchup with Kevin Durant, who seems to be back in his elite space after an 18-month absence after Achilles injury. Durant\u2019s entire season is going to be a refresher course for anyone who has selective amnesia in regards to the most accomplished scorer of his generation (sorry James Harden). And he he might not even lead the Nets in scoring this season, what with Kyrie Irving burning up the nets (and sage ) in his official return to Boston, and everywhere he goes. Keep an eye on: Jaylen Brown, the Celtics\u2019 \u201cother\u201d star, continues to fly under the radar far too often. He put together an All-Star caliber campaign last season, as one of the league\u2019s best two-way talents, but might have to wait until this season to be rewarded. Dallas Mavericks vs. Los Angeles Lakers, 8 ET (ABC\/ESPN) There\u2019s a reason this game earned the prime time slot. Like giddy children tearing open gifts in the morning, LeBron James has become a Christmas Day staple the past 17 seasons. He\u2019s done it at every stop, from Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland, and now in Los Angeles, where he and Anthony Davis restored order after just one season together. Luka Doncic might want to take notes on how to do it on the holiday, because this is one of many items he could inherit from the current global face of the league. No one cares that both the Lakers and Mavericks are coming off losses in their respective season openers. The last time we saw Luka square off against two of L.A.\u2019s finest under the lights, he was foreshadowing the postseason demise of the LA Clippers in the Orlando bubble. The venue changes but not the tug of the future (Luka\u2019s just 21) on the suffocating grip of the past and present (LeBron is a mere days away from his 36th birthday). Keep an eye on: New Lakers point guard Dennis Schroder is still in the early stages of figuring out how to play alongside LeBron, an experience that\u2019s worked out extremely well for so many others the past. He\u2019s the type of competitor that\u2019ll be eager to steal the show with a vintage performance of his own. Los Angeles Clippers vs. Denver Nuggets, 10:30 ET (ESPN) The first step of the Clippers\u2019 vengeance\/redemption tour went as planned, as they spoiled ring night at Staples Center for the Lakers in Tuesday\u2019s season opener. The opportunity to get a piece of the team that humiliated them in rallying from a 3-1 deficit in Western Conference semifinals the Orlando bubble has to be just as inviting. It\u2019s not that the Clippers will be able to wipe away the sting of the Lakers winning the championship they thought was theirs, or the Nuggets rallying to knock them off before they get even got a chance to compete for it. Every target nailed on this new quest for Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and these reconstituted Clippers is what matters. The Nuggets, of course, are still fuming that their rally for the ages is still being categorized as a \u201ccollapse\u201d instead of their triumph. Jamal Murray had a rough night (1-for-9 shooting, 9 points) in the Nuggets\u2019 overtime loss to Buddy Hield\u2019s tip-in at the buzzer. So you know he\u2019ll be ready for a bounce back effort with the whole world watching. Keep an eye on: Nuggets All-NBA center Nikola Jokic looked like his usual self in the opener. So did the other player the Nuggets are counting on taking that next step this season. Michael Porter Jr.\u2019s breakout in the Orlando bubble is the launching pad that led to his 24-point, 5-rebound, 3-block effort against the Kings. We need to see more and more of Porter under the brightest of lights. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Build your perfect Christmas Day fantasy squad \u2014 then enter FanDuel\u2019s Santa Slam contest to compete for a share of $1,000,000 in total payouts.        Before the action tips off with Pelicans-Heat at noon ET on ESPN , check out some players to consider for your FanDuel daily fantasy lineups on Christmas Day. Luka Doncic ($11,300): The third-year Mavericks star is the second-most expensive player on Christmas Day, but he should be able to still provide value in his team\u2019s matchup against LeBron James and the Lakers. Doncic got his season off to a solid start with 32 points, eight rebounds and five assists (for 48.1 daily fantasy points) against the Suns on Wednesday. Jrue Holiday ($7,000): The Bucks\u2019 main offseason addition will have a chance to showcase his impact on defense when Steph Curry comes to town with the Warriors. While he may be focused on defending Curry, Holiday should still be able to provide value at his price point. He posted 25 points, six rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block (for 42.7 daily fantasy points) in the Bucks\u2019 season opening loss to the Celtics. Jeff Teague ($5,800): Where in the world is Jeff Teague? He\u2019s in Boston with a chance for extended playing time as Kemba Walker recovers from a knee injury. The veteran guard should be able to provide a steady presence for the Celtics so he\u2019s worth a look if you need a mid-level point guard option. Teague looked great against the Bucks on Wednesday, tallying 19 points, four assists, three rebounds, two steals and a block (for 37.6 daily fantasy points) in just 25 minutes. Paul George ($7,600): The All-Star forward struggled during the season restart in Orlando. But he looked like his old self in the Clippers\u2019 opening night win over the Lakers. He scored 33 points on 13-for-18 shooting to go along with six rebounds, three assists and a steal. He\u2019ll look to keep his strong start going against a Nuggets squad that likes to push the pace. Dennis Schroder ($5,000): The Lakers\u2019 offseason addition showed off his skills in their opening night loss to the Clippers. He tallied 39.4 daily fantasy points as he came close to posting a triple double (14 points, 12 rebounds and 8 assists) in just 27 minutes. At just $5,000, Schroder could be in a lot of daily fantasy lineups for his team\u2019s matchup against the Mavericks. Donte DiVincenzo ($4,500): The third-year guard has quickly settled into his role as a starter in Milwaukee. He caught fire in the Bucks\u2019 loss to the Celtics, finishing with 30.5 daily fantasy points thanks to 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals. He should receive even more opportunity in what should be a high-scoring matchup against the Warriors on Christmas, so he\u2019s worth a look if you need a low-to-mid-level option at shooting guard. Jaylen Brown ($7,500): With Kemba Walker sidelined by a knee injury, Brown has more opportunity on the offensive end with Boston to start the season. This makes him an intriguing option at the small forward spot in a matchup against the Nets. He tallied 33 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block (for 54 daily fantasy points) in the Celtics\u2019 opening night win over the Bucks. He should provide similar value on Christmas. Caris LeVert ($5,800): The Nets\u2019 promising young guard was terrific on opening night as he tallied 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block in just 24 minutes to rack up 45.3 daily fantasy points. This huge performance means LeVert likely will be in a lot of daily fantasy lineups on Christmas for his team\u2019s matchup against the Celtics. Tyler Herro ($5,000): The second-year guard shined for Miami during the season restart in Orlando. And he has started the 2020-21 season at a similar pace. He posted 13 points, six rebounds and four assists (for 22.2 daily fantasy points) in his team\u2019s opening night win over the Magic. There aren\u2019t many solid, low-priced options at small forward on Christmas, so if you need one, Herro should be a solid choice. Giannis Antetokounmpo ($11,600): What more needs to be said about the reigning back-to-back Kia MVP? While he\u2019s the most expensive option on Christmas, he could be eager to shine after the Bucks lost to the Sixers last year on the holiday. He should be able to dominate against the Warriors. He started his season on Tuesday with 35 points, 13 rebounds, two assists and two blocks (for 52.6 daily fantasy points). Plus, he may have some extra motivation after missing a game-tying free throw in the loss to Boston. Kevin Durant ($8,500): The two-time Finals MVP made it look effortless in his season debut with the Nets on Tuesday. He tallied 22 points, five rebounds, three assists, three steals and one block (for 43.5 daily fantasy points) in just 24 minutes against the Warriors. He should be in line for even higher minutes and numbers against the Celtics on Christmas. Kyle Kuzma ($4,200): If you want to win a large daily fantasy tournament, you need to take some risks in your lineup. Kuzma could be a solid, potentially low-owned option to consider as you try to create your winning squad. He scored 15 points in 26 minutes on Tuesday, but struggled to tally many other stats. If he can add some rebounds and defensive stats against the Mavericks, then he could end up providing good value. Bam Adebayo ($8,500): Adebayo will have his work cut out for himself with a matchup against Zion Williamson, Steven Adams and the Pelicans. But this challenge could be just what Miami\u2019s All-Star center needs to post a monster stat line. He dominated the Magic in the Heat\u2019s opening night win with 25 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and a block (for 40.2 daily fantasy points). Steven Adams ($5,500): The former Thunder center is in New Orleans this season and he should receive plenty of opportunities to produce alongside Zion. Adams posted 40.1 daily fantasy points in the Pelicans\u2019 season opener against the Raptors. The 27-year-old big man finished with eight points, eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks and four steals in 30 minutes. Expect another stat-stuffing performance from him on Christmas. James Wiseman ($4,200): The No. 2 overall pick started at center for the Warriors in their season opening loss to the Nets on Tuesday. He was solid in his debut, posting 19 points, six rebounds and two steals in 24 minutes for 31.2 daily fantasy points. He\u2019ll have a tough matchup against the Bucks. But if the game turns into a blowout, he could have a great chance to shine on Christmas Day. > Learn the basics: FanDuel Training Guide"},{"id":456147,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/westbrook-hayward-highlight-night-full-of-debuts-with-new-teams","date":"2020-12-24","title":"Westbrook, Hayward highlight night full of debuts with new teams","content":"Thursday marked opening night for 87% of the league, with several highly anticipated first impressions taking place. Superstars, missing pieces and rookies all took the court for the first time with their new teams. NBA.com takes a look at some of the more notable newcomers and how they did: Stat line: 25 points (10-16 FG), 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals, 1 block How he did: Milwaukee paid a boat-load to acquire Holiday in the offseason, and Thursday night showed why. The versatile guard joined forces with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, the three of whom combined for 87 points. The Bucks didn\u2019t win, a statement that won\u2019t be uttered too often in the regular season. Stat line: 31 points (13-25 FG), 11 rebounds, 5 assists How they did: Boston desperately needed veteran insurance at point guard and more muscle in the middle. Teague and Thompson provided exactly that in a statement win over the Bucks, a team they will be battling for Eastern Conference supremacy in the months ahead. Stat line: 21 points (9-22 FG), 11 rebounds, 15 assists How he did: The former Kia MVP didn\u2019t bother easing into things with his new team, and it worked for most of the game. Only a late-game team collapse prevented Westbrook from enjoying a completely successful debut in a Wizards uniform. Stat line: 15 points (5-14 FG), 4 steals How they did: Philadelphia rallied to beat Washington, but they\u2019ll bank on better outside shooting from their new guards, who combine to make just one of their nine attempts from 3-point range. Stat line: 28 points (11-18 FG), 4 rebounds, 7 assists, 1 steal How he did: Is the All-Star version of Hayward back? If so, Charlotte might be friskier than expected out East. Hayward appeared completely healthy and comfortable, a combination that will hopefully help the Hornets make up for their opening-night loss to Cleveland. Stat line: 11 points (4-5 FG), 3 rebounds, 5 assists How he did: The Cavs could get very exciting very soon if Okoro\u2019s NBA debut is any indication. The fifth overall pick from this year\u2019s Draft ran the floor, cut and attacked, and spotted up for 3. His early chemistry with third-year guard Collin Sexton is especially promising. Stat line: 26 points (10-18 FG), 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 5 steals, 3 blocks How they did: Young teams need veterans they can count on. In their first game with the Pelicans, Adams and Bledsoe showed proof they can be that. Bledsoe\u2019s debut in particular was encouraging. The veteran guard shot 4-for-8 from deep, a welcome development for a team in desperate need of spacing. Stat line: 11 points (5-9 FG), 9 rebounds How he did: The center spot is Toronto\u2019s big question mark this season. Baynes held his own, but was under constant pressure trying to protect the defensive glass from Zion Williamson and Steven Adams. He\u2019ll play a significant role in Toronto remaining a title contender. Stat line: 28 points (9-18 FG), 11 rebounds, 5 assists How they did: Gallinari and Bogdanovic were Atlanta\u2019s headline offseason additions, and they proved plenty capable of stepping up and knocking shots down in what should be one of the league\u2019s most explosive offenses this season. Bogdanovic didn\u2019t shoot as well (5-12 FG), but was active on the glass to help make up for it. Stat line: 16 points (5-11 FG), 4 rebounds How he did: The fourth overall pick of the Draft got valuable reps from the get-go. And though it wasn\u2019t a pleasant night for the Bulls, Williams acquitted himself well and was the only Bulls starter that didn\u2019t commit a turnover. Stat line:  See full stats here How they did: It\u2019s easy to forget Plumlee was once a Team USA senior team center, but he reminded some people with 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Free agent headliner Grant and top draft pick Hayes each struggled, but Jackson and Okafor (27 points, 13 rebounds combined) were pleasant surprises off the bench. Stat line: 15 points (5-12 FG), 4 rebounds, 4 assists How he did: The fit in a crowded backcourt will develop in time, but 25 minutes of playing time in a win made for a solid debut for the No. 1 overall pick. Edwards showed his elite knack for getting to the rim, but he made just one of his six shot attempts outside the paint. Stat line: 10 points (5-5 FG), 7 rebounds, 3 assists How he did: Favor\u2019s feel-good return to Utah felt even better after Utah\u2019s opening-night waxing of the Blazers. The veteran big man was only gone for a year, but immediately reminded everyone why he\u2019s an immediate upgrade to the Jazz\u2019s frontcourt. Stat line: 10 points (3-12 FG), 8 rebounds How they did: A new system against one of the best defenses in the league did no favors to Covington and Jones, who will undoubtedly have better games ahead. Interesting to note was Covington\u2019s three shot attempts, tied for eighth-most on the team. Stat line: 12 points (4-15 FG), 13 rebounds, 9 assists How they did: The Suns\u2019 key veteran additions didn\u2019t shoot well, but they made big plays in a nationally televised win over the Mavericks. Paul in particular came up predictably clutch, picking off a pass and hitting a big-time shot in the final minutes to help Phoenix hold off Dallas. Stat line: 12 points (5-11 FG), 7 rebounds How he did: Richardson will be especially relied on while Kristaps Porzingis is out. He played good defense on Devin Booker, but Dallas will need better shooting to help ease the defensive attention on Luka Doncic."},{"id":456646,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-hield-flies-in-for-game-winning-tip","date":"2020-12-24","title":"Horry Scale: Hield flies in for game-winning tip","content":"A heads up play by Buddy Hield beat the buzzer to sink the Nuggets in Denver. A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * The Nuggets had the ball and a chance to win in overtime. They never got that chance. Nikola Jokic, one of the most trustworthy decision-makers in the league, was immediately pressured and had the ball stripped by Harrison Barnes near halfcourt. As the final five seconds ticked away, Barnes rose for what could have been a game-winning jam. Will Barton contested, and the ball popped free. For an instant, it seemed the scoreless chaos would produce nothing more than a second overtime. Except to Buddy Hield, who trailed the play at top speed, soared high, and banked in a one-handed tip shot as time expired. The Kings left Denver euphoric over their dramatic season-opening 124-122 win, while the Nuggets \u2014 fresh off a run to the Western Conference Finals last season \u2014 simply looked stunned at the completely unexpected outcome. DIFFICULTY  Hield\u2019s momentum almost didn\u2019t allow him to corral the ball, which he still managed to do with just one hand. Normally not a yeoman on the offensive boards, the 28-year-old still had enough instinctual touch and wherewithal to place an awkward push shot from midair off the glass. And remember, all this came amidst an absolutely insane sequence of play. Replicate the shot yourself in a game of H-O-R-S-E. You\u2019ll miss at least as many as you make. GAME SITUATION  Opening night energy is weird to begin with. Throw in the unusual timing of this particular season, the fact the game was already one overtime deep, and the Denver altitude, and you\u2019d forgive the Kings for playing conservatively or even botching their last defensive stand. They didn\u2019t, and in a slightly shortened season, every win (or loss) like this in the loaded Western Conference is huge. CELEBRATION  Hield got Sacramento the win and got the heck out of there, with his teammates chasing the jubilant shooting guard all the way through the tunnel. Everything about the mock escape spoke of the Kings stealing the game, which they absolutely did. Incredibly appropriate. GRADE  Sacramento owns the longest playoff drought in the league (14 years). Their biggest offseason change was losing Bogdan Bogdnanovic in free agency. But that opens up more time for Hield, a development that paid off on night one of the new season. Sacramento is 1-0 in the West, a conference where one game can be the difference. 4 Horrys ."},{"id":456247,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/russell-westbrook-begins-wizards-tenure-with-triple-double-on-opening-night","date":"2020-12-24","title":"Russell Westbrook begins Wizards tenure with triple-double on opening night","content":"New city. New uniform. Same production. Wearing a Wizards jersey didn\u2019t change Russell Westbrook\u2019s identity as the modern-day titan of triple-doubles. The former Kia MVP announced a new era of his career with a performance that has become almost routine: 21 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds in his debut game with Washington. The All-Star guard was a plus-10 in a game Washington lost down the stretch, ultimately falling 113-107 to Philadelphia. Westbrook and Bradley Beal combined for 52 points, a likely preview of the Wizards\u2019 star-studded backcourt that will try to get Washington back in the playoffs. Westbrook\u2019s arrival marks a new era for Washington after he was acquired in exchange for former No. 1 pick and long-time Wizards guard John Wall. Thursday night marked the latest Westbrook entry in the record books.

Luka Doncic (DAL) vs. Suns: $11,400 Luka Doncic will have his work cut out for him with Kristaps Porzingis sidelined, but he should exploit Phoenix\u2019s vulnerable defense. He averaged 51.8 FanDuel points per game last season. Ja Morant (MEM) vs. SA: $7,800 A high posted total? Check (it\u2019s at 231.5). A lack of depth? Check. Bottom-five defense? Check. Fire up Ja Morant. Darius Garland (CLE) vs. CHA: $4,400 He\u2019s a starter in a banged-up offense (see: Kevin Love). Darius Garland is a volume-based bargain play, but you\u2019re probably better off spending up at the position. Devin Booker (PHO) vs. DAL: $8,400 I\u2019m targeting lots of Mavs and Suns in the game with the slate\u2019s highest posted total (237). Devin Booker is a safe play to post tons of points. He averaged 26.8 points, 6.5 assists, and 5.25 rebounds against Dallas last year. Dillon Brooks (MEM) vs. SA: $5,100 As with Morant, Dillon Brooks should benefit from the injuries surrounding him. He averaged 28.8 points per game over his last 10 appearances. Luguentz Dort (OKC) at HOU: $3,900 Luguentz Dort flashed upside late last season. He finished with 4x his FanDuel price in six of his last 10 games. Now that CP3 is gone, he\u2019ll get more run, too. Jaylen Brown (BOS) vs. MIL: $7,500 The Celtics won\u2019t have Gordon Hayward or Kemba Walker, and Jaylen Brown was better than Jayson Tatum against the Bucks last year. He posted 22 points and 4.0 rebounds against them in his one appearance; Tatum averaged 15.7 points and 6.0 rebounds across his three games. Brown is also $2.3k cheaper than Tatum. Dorian Finney-Smith (DAL) at POR: $4,200 Dorian Finney-Smith had a solid preseason and will get lots of run with Porzingis out. Kyle Anderson (MEM) vs. SA: $3,800 Kyle Anderson is another Grizzly in an exploitable matchup. Jaren Jackson Jr\u2019s injury opens the door for him to play more minutes, but I\u2019d only roll with him if you\u2019re absolutely punting this position. Pascal Siakam (TOR) vs. NO: $8,000 With Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol gone \u2014 two of Toronto\u2019s other top-three rebounders \u2014 Pascal Siakam should have more opportunities to post boards. That\u2019s not the end-all, be-all, but at the start of a new season, there\u2019s some upside here. Bojan Bogdanovic (UTH) at POR: $4,600 The Blazers ranked 28th in defensive efficiency last year. Bojan Bogdanovic and the feasted in the preseason and will keep feasting against Portland. De\u2019Andre Hunter (ATL) at CHI: $3,800 Deandre Hunter got plenty of run in the preseason. He didn\u2019t always do much with his minutes, but he\u2019s not a bad volume-based upside play if you\u2019re really looking to save money at the position. Deandre Ayton (PHO) vs. DAL: $7,600 Deandre Ayton is a great target against the Porzingis-less Mavs. He averaged 39.3 FanDuel points per game last year. He averaged 16.3 points and 8.7 rebounds against Dallas last year. Those numbers aren\u2019t the best, but they\u2019re also deflated by a game that Ayton fouled himself out of early. Dwight Powell (DAL) at PHO: $4,700 If you don\u2019t like Ayton, Dwight Powell will benefit from Porzingis\u2019 absence more directly. He averaged 19.3 minutes per game in the preseason but certainly isn\u2019t a risk-free play. Aron Baynes (TOR) vs. NO: $4,200 Aron Baynes will replace Marc Gasol as Toronto\u2019s center. Gasol averaged 23.6 FanDuel points per game last year. That said, it\u2019s always risky to start anyone making their first start on a new team.

Opening Night gave the people what they wanted, showcasing the return of popular stars in the early Golden State-Brooklyn game followed by the Lakers\u2019 ring ceremony and hallway rivalry with the Clippers in Los Angeles. But many savvy fans know that, just as with baseball\u2019s Opening Day, it\u2019s the second day that draws the hardcore enthusiasts. The sheer number of games available will require a deft touch on the remote to catch as many as possible stretching across six hours or so. The games on the Wednesday schedule represent the 2020-21 season openers for all of these teams. That means plenty of hooks and angles, enough to put you in a multi-device stupor if you\u2019re not careful. It also means NBA League Pass is back ( and free all week ). From old faces in new places to upstart teams confident they\u2019re ready for their close-ups, here are reasons to watch every game on the NBA\u2019s second Opening Night: It\u2019s encouraging to see that Gordon Hayward, the biggest and most surprising free-agent acquisition, is going to try to play at Cleveland despite the fractured finger on his right hand. But the real reason to check out Hornets vs. Cavaliers is to witness LaMelo Ball\u2019s debut. Cleveland is happy with rookie wing Isaac Okoro, but as coach J.B. Bickerstaff sorts through his imperfect backup options, he and the rest of the Cavs might gnash some teeth knowing they were two picks away from snagging Ball last month. The prospect of getting our first glimpse at a popular choice for Kia Rookie of the Year means catching Knicks forward Obi Toppin for as long as he\u2019s on the floor at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, not watching new Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren work the sideline. Unlike New York, Indiana is banking on a pat hand with its starting lineup, hoping Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner finally click sharing the frontcourt and crossing its fingers that Victor Oladipo again is a productive force. As much as we\u2019d like to bill Heat vs. Magic as a battle of Florida, the sunny hard facts are that these teams will be working opposite ends of the Eastern Conference playoff standings. The lure here isn\u2019t just an early look at what matinee idol Tyler Herro has to offer as a theoretical Sophomore of the Year candidate but how maximally paid Bam Adebayo gets back to work as a force in the paint and Defensive Player of the Year candidate. There are big changes and expectations in Philadelphia, where the Sixers play host to the Wizards with Daryl Morey, Doc Rivers, an allegedly recommitted Joel Embiid and better shooters on board. But the intrigue Wednesday night is simpler: Ben Simmons and new Washington addition Russell Westbrook are two of the league\u2019s top \u201cunicorn\u201d players, representing potentially the night\u2019s best matchup. What we see in Milwaukee at Boston could boil down to who\u2019s new vs. who\u2019s missing. The Bucks\u2019 big intended enhancement is guard Jrue Holiday, an upgrade from Eric Bledsoe and considered a persuasive acquisition toward Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s decision to re-sign . This might not qualify as a great first test, though, with the Celtics starting without injured point guard Kemba Walker, an early absence that may compound the loss of free agent Gordon Hayward. But there\u2019s history between these teams that should set a tone for their season-long battles in the East. It\u2019s probably going to require some exterior shots and descriptions from the broadcast crews to get any sense of place when New Orleans faces Toronto in Tampa, Fla. The Raptors and the league have done everything possible to make Tampa\u2019s Amelie Arena feel like We The North, including hanging the 2019 NBA championship banner in the rafters. Of greater interest on the court will be seeing the Pelicans\u2019 Zion Williamson ready and available for a full schedule (no jinx). Oh, and the return to the sideline \u2013 in casual attire no less \u2013 of New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy. Atlanta snagged early claim to being one of the NBA\u2019s new \u201cLeague Pass darlings\u201d with assorted roster improvements \u2013 Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo, Kris Dunn, draft pick Onyeka Okongwu \u2013 to provide big boosts for Trae Young, John Collins, Clint Capela and the rest. So it\u2019s the reconfigured Hawks\u2019 contrast with the Bulls that provides the interest at United Center. Chicago has a new boss (Arturas Karnisovas) and a new coach (Billy Donovan) but will be running out familiar young faces in Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr., and Coby White ( potential breakout player ) to hopefully make up for lost development pre-bubble last season. Bonus interest: Patrick Williams, the No. 4 pick who never started at Florida State, is penciled in to do so in his NBA rookie icebreaker. Out of respect and curiosity, it might be worth tuning in to see Gregg Popovich grinding away to show us how the San Antonio sausage gets made. DeMar DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMarre Carroll are still around with their veteran resumes and bonus capital letters, but this team\u2019s future depends on the kids, including Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Tre Jones and Devin Vassell (the No. 11 pick, highest for these guys since they landed Tim Duncan at No. 1 in 1997). For the Spurs\u2019 clash at Memphis, we\u2019re more excited about seeing what defensive ace Murray and his mates do against Ja Morant. The precocious 2020 Rookie of the Year won\u2019t have Jaren Jackson Jr. or Justice Winslow to help Wednesday, but he does have Brandon Clarke, De\u2019Anthony Melton and Tyus Jones in solid support for his electric, attacking game. Everything old is new again as Detroit plays at Minnesota, with Blake Griffin and Ricky Rubio back for the Pistons and the Timberwolves, respectively. There are other veterans, notably former Nugget Jerami Grant and sixth man Derrick Rose for Detroit and Karl-Anthony Towns and bud D\u2019Angelo Russell for Minny, to pay attention to. But the appeal of both teams comes from their youngsters. That means Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey for the visitors, No. 1 pick Anthony Edwards and last year\u2019s disappointing arrival Jarrett Culver for the Wolves. Sacramento has spent years rounding up young talent with little in terms of team results to show for it. That suggests a mismatch for the Kings in their opener against the Nuggets in Denver. How high are the hopes for Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr. and the rest who scratched their way back not once but twice (down 3-1 vs. the Jazz and the Clippers) in the bubble playoffs? There\u2019s talk of Jokic as a Kia MVP candidate, Murray as All-NBA, Porter as Most Improved and the Nuggets as the team that might rack up the most regular-season victories in 2020-21. Obvious place to start is this one. Both Utah and Portland are Western Conference stalwarts, relatively speaking, good enough to push toward an upper seed and get their fans excited for the postseason but so far not good enough for a Finals payoff. We\u2019ll settle for some individual matchups to get things going, with the Rudy Gobert-Jusuf Nurkic up front as the undercard to Donovan Mitchell-Damian Lillard on the ball. Night owls and West Coasters get a serious showcase of compelling, must-see teams when Dallas plays at Phoenix as the second national game. Mavericks\u2019 MVP prospect Luka Doncic averaged 30.3 points against the Suns last season but will have to contend with newly added Chris Paul in that Phoenix backcourt. Suns guard Devin Booker slapped back with 26.8 ppg against Dallas last season. Both clubs have high hopes, with Phoenix adding a fleet of role players around Paul, Booker, Deandre Ayton, Cameron Johnson and Mikal Bridges. The Mavs need Doncic to click completely with Kristaps Porzingis, but he\u2019ll be in street clothes into January as far as TV glimpses, owing to meniscus surgery on his right knee. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Highlighting the action is a TNT\/ESPN split doubleheader beginning with an Eastern Conference clash between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Boston Celtics on TNT ( 7:30 p.m. ET ), followed by two rising teams in the Western Conference with the Phoenix Suns hosting the Dallas Mavericks on ESPN ( 10 p.m. ET ). When it comes to young star power, these two matchups offer a look at four players that are poised to be dominant players in this league for the next decade. The Bucks and Celtics matchup features one player that has already risen to the Kia MVP level and another that many believe is on that trajectory. Last season, Giannis Antetokounmpo joined some elite company. Not only did he become only 12 th player in league history to win MVP honors in back-to-back seasons, he joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players to win multiple MVPs by the age of 25. Antetokounmpo also become only the third player to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season, joining Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon. When we take a look at his numbers, there is another pair of NBA legends that Antetokounmpo joined as he became just the third player in NBA history to average at least 29 points, 13 rebounds and five assists in a season \u2014 the he became the first to do so in 54 seasons . Giannis put up those gaudy stats despite averaging just 30.4 minutes per game, which was tied for 71 st in the NBA last season. That combination of production and limited minutes helped Giannis post the highest single-seasons PER in league history (31.85). While Giannis has already posted his name alongside some of the game\u2019s all-time greats as he enters his eighth season, the numbers point toward Tatum being on a similar path as he enters his fourth season. In 2019-20, Tatum was named to his first All-NBA team as he earned Third Team honors, finished 12 th in MVP voting and narrowly missed being named to an All-Defensive team for the first time in his career. Effecting the game on both ends of the court is a trait that Antetokounmpo and Tatum share. A great way to measure which players impact the game the most is to look at how well their team performs while they are on the court vs. how they fare when they are off it. Last season, 165 players logged at least 1,400 minutes. Of that group, here are the six that had a double-digit on-court\/off-court net rating differential \u2014 meaning their team was at least 10 points per 100 possessions better with them on the court compared to when they were on the bench. Antetokounmpo and Tatum rank second and fourth, respectively, on this list. The rest of it is comprised of a who\u2019s-who of outstanding two-way NBA players. When it came to head-to-head competition last season, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks got the better of Tatum and the Celtics, winning the season series 2-1. The Bucks also held Tatum in check offensively, as Tatum averaged just 15.7 ppg on 33.3% shooting \u2014 his second-lowest scoring average and shooting efficiency against any team last season. Meanwhile, Antetokounmpo averaged 30 ppg, 15.3 rpg and 6.3 apg vs. Boston. Luka Doncic\u2019s 2019-20 season will go down as one of the greatest sophomore seasons in NBA history. He averaged 28.8 ppg, 9.4 rpg and 8.8 apg, leading the league in triple-doubles (17) while directing the most efficient offense in NBA history (115.8 points per 100 possessions). Here is the list of players that have averaged at least 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists over an NBA season: Robertson accomplished the feat in both his rookie and sophomore seasons, but Doncic holds the distinction as the youngest player to post those numbers in a season. Robertson was a 22-year-old rookie while Doncic turned 21 midway through his sophomore season. The dramatic leap that Luka made in his second season \u2014 plus-7.6 ppg, plus-1.6 rpg, plus-2.8 apg, plus-3.6 FG%, plus-9 triple-doubles in 11 fewer games played \u2014 combined with his age makes the ceiling he can potentially reach tantalizing for fans (and fearsome for foes). Doncic ranked third in the NBA in usage rate last season at 35.5%, trailing only Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden \u2014 two players that have combined to win the last three Kia MVPs. In this year\u2019s NBA.com GM survey , Doncic (21%) trailed only Antetokounmpo (32%) as the favorite to win the 2020-21 MVP. The last player to win MVP honors in their third season was Derrick Rose (2011). Back then, he became the youngest player to win the award (22 years, six months and 29 days old). Should Doncic accomplish that feat, he\u2019d break that record as he will be 22 years, four months and 24 days old on the final day of the 2021 playoffs (July 22). In four games against the Suns last season, Doncic averaged 30.3 ppg, 7.0 rpg and 6.0 apg, but the Suns won the season series 3-1 \u2014 including both games during the NBA restart in Orlando. The Suns went a perfect 8-0 in the bubble, with Devin Booker leading the way. Booker averaged 30.5 ppg, 6.0 apg and 4.9 rpg, while shooting 50.3% overall as the Suns outscored their opponents by 10.8 points per game with Booker on the court in Orlando. It was during Booker\u2019s sophomore season in 2016-17 that he established himself as one of the NBA\u2019s top scorers, averaging 22.1 ppg to finish in the top 25 in the league at just 20 years old. That was also the season in which Booker became only the sixth player in league history (and youngest) to post a 70-point game . Booker posted only the 11 th 70-point game in NBA history, joining Wilt Chamberlain (6x), Kobe Bryant, David Thompson, Elgin Baylor and David Robinson. Booker averaged 24.9 ppg in 2017-18, which would have ranked in the top 10 had he played enough games to qualify (he played 54, needed to play 58). In the past two seasons, Booker has averaged 26.6 ppg, ranking seventh in the league in 2018-19 and ninth last season. In addition to becoming a top-10 scorer, Booker has also improved as a playmaker, averaging at least 6.5 apg in each of the past two seasons. Last season, Booker ranked sixth in the league in pull-up shot attempts with 641 and connected at a 42.1% rank \u2014 fourth among high-volume pull-up shooters. Finishing right above Booker in attempts last season was Chris Paul, who put up 658 pull-ups with Oklahoma City. Paul and Booker and now teammates, and it will be interesting to see how Paul\u2019s presence may impact Booker\u2019s scoring profile. Whether its pull-ups, catch-and-shoots, drives to the basket or hand-off, one thing all NBA fans have learned over the past few seasons is the Booker will get buckets. As he enters his sixth NBA season, can Booker and the Suns build on the momentum they found in the bubble and couple individual success with team success and end the team\u2019s 10-year playoff drought? A strong showing against Doncic and the Mavs would be a great start."},{"id":454409,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2020-21-all-league-pass-team","date":"2020-12-23","title":"All-League Pass Team: Wizards among 5 must-watch squads","content":"If you\u2019ve never experienced the greatness of NBA League Pass, we suggest you check out the free seven-day trial here , which is sure to be filled with plenty of fun matchups that you won\u2019t be able to catch on national television. Here\u2019s a look at my five teams with fewer than 10 nationally-televised games this season that are definitely worth watching on NBA League Pass, along with my \u201cSixth Team of the Year.\u201d On the low, Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk is already being mentioned as an Executive of the Year candidate, and for good reason given the offseason he just orchestrated in Atlanta. Trae Young alone is already must-watch TV, but the Hawks pulled in plenty of help for the young star by adding Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kris Dunn, Danilo Gallinari, Solomon Hill, Rajon Rando and Tony Snell, in addition to drafting Onyeka Okongwu and Skylar Mays. Let\u2019s not forget about this team\u2019s promising nucleus that includes the rim-running Clint Capela (expect lots of lobs), John Collins, Cam Reddish and De\u2019Andre Hunter. You\u2019ll probably see plenty of highlight-filled high-scoring nights for this young talented team looking to return to the postseason for the first time since the 2016-17 season. Reality television fans should appreciate what could be in the works with this squad regardless of whether James Harden remains with the team. Houston switched coaches and general managers, in addition to trading Russell Westbrook and Robert Covington. Through the Westbrook trade, the club brought in John Wall, who could prove to be a lethal pairing with Harden, in addition to DeMarcus Cousins and Christian Wood. Wood is already showing some early chemistry with Harden, but you wonder how long it will last with the perennial Kia MVP candidate reportedly wanting out of Houston. New coach Stephen Silas wants to tweak what the high-powered Rockets have done in the past, and make them a more diverse team, capable of playing at a high level conventionally or small. Nobody expected much from Oklahoma City last season, but Chris Paul\u2019s presence and veteran leadership quickly changed that, as the point guard led the Thunder to the postseason just one season removed from finishing with career lows in field goal percentage (41.9%) and scoring average (15.6 ppg) in Houston. So, think about what Paul might do with this Phoenix team, and also consider the star power that was already on the Suns roster in Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton before that trade. Phoenix worked to build on its 8-0 NBA bubble finish in the offseason by reuniting Paul with coach Monty Williams, while also adding shooting depth. You can expect Ayton\u2019s pick-and-roll game to take a leap working with a future Hall of Fame point guard, and young superstar Booker finally starts a season with a legit shot at making the playoffs. With the second-longest active postseason streak (seven consecutive years), you\u2019d expect the Trail Blazers to be featured in more nationally-televised games; especially with a highlight machine in Damian Lillard leading the squad. Portland increased its athleticism in the offseason by adding Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr., and bolstered depth with Enes Kanter and the re-signings of Carmelo Anthony and Rodney Hood. Gary Trent Jr. is poised for a breakout campaign. It\u2019s important to note the Trail Blazers made the Western Conference finals just two seasons ago. They\u2019re healthy now, and they\u2019ve got one of the league\u2019s most dynamic backcourts in Lillard and CJ McCollum, and a reliable big in Jusuf Nurkic, who averaged 17.6 ppg in the NBA bubble. As tough as it was to watch Washington move Wall for Westbrook the day before the start of training camp, you can\u2019t help but ponder the possibilities for the Wizards\u2019 backcourt this season. How Westbrook adapts his game to fit alongside Beal will be critical to Washington\u2019s success. Given Westbrook\u2019s past in Oklahoma City with coach Scott Brooks and his commitment to winning, you\u2019d expect the former MVP to defer to Beal when needed. The guards should have plenty of options when teams load up on them too. Rui Hachimura, the No. 9 overall pick in 2019, averaged 13.5 ppg and 6.1 rpg as a rookie, and sharpshooter Davis Bertans averaged 42.4% last season from deep. We\u2019ve already seen enough evidence in the preseason to know the Hornets will be a fun team to watch with No. 3 pick LaMelo Ball on the roster. It\u2019s expected he\u2019ll start the season coming off the bench, but don\u2019t expect that to last long. He\u2019s too good. New addition Gordon Hayward needs to fit in quickly here for Charlotte to make some noise. Hayward played well for a spell in Boston last season, but an ankle injury ultimately knocked him off rhythm. In Charlotte, Hayward, 30, might turn out to be the galvanizing force needed to bring together the youth on the roster in Ball, Devonte\u2019 Graham, P.J. Washington, Miles Bridges and Malik Monk. Hayward fractured a finger on his right hand in the preseason but is expected to play in Charlotte\u2019s opener at Cleveland. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The latest and certainly the strangest for the Lakers was done Tuesday without fans here in the Year of The Pandemic, and also without the visiting team, since the Clippers had the good sense to stay in the locker room and spare themselves any further embarrassing reminders of the 2019-20 season. It was the first for LeBron James as a Laker, and the first for Anthony Davis as a pro, and also a first in terms of presentation: Family members, appearing on video, \u201cawarded\u201d their favorite Laker with his ring. So the 17th celebration was a Laker Night, the entire night actually, because a seven-point loss didn\u2019t exactly ruin the moment or the meaning or the massive expectations this season for a team favored to win back-to-back. All it did was give the Clippers a sense of satisfaction and the chance to symbolically raise an opening night victory banner. Normally in these ceremonies, there are spotlight introductions, sustained applause, video tributes and in total a 25-minute pat on the back for the champs. Instead, the Lakers had Adam Silver, who of course was a welcome sight, but little else in terms of tradition besides the commissioner. \u201cWeird in all facets,\u201d said LeBron. \u201cJust a weird day. To do it without our family and friends and fans, just a weird day to say the least.\u201d Oh, and a few awkwardly amusing viral family twists: Lakers reserve Kostas Antetokounmpo was congratulated on film by two of his brothers, both members of the Bucks, one of whom happens to be the reigning two-time league MVP, and Giannis wisecracked: \u201cLet\u2019s get more rings, man.\u201d Then, in the far corner of Staples Center, Marcus Morris of the Clippers videoed his twin brother Markieff; Marcus said it was a family accomplishment regardless of which brother got bling. And just in case anyone forgot about the added motivation for \u201cLeave A Legacy,\u201d which was the theme of the 2019-20 Lakers, general manager Rob Pelinka accepted his ring and flashed two fingers on his right hand and four on his left, signifying the 24 worn by the late Kobe Bryant. But this night arrived just 72 days after the Lakers actually and officially won those rings, a historically short offseason that the Lakers must learn to cope with. To prepare for the quick turnover, LeBron and Davis won\u2019t see heavy minutes here in the early season. And that tone was set right from the start, when LeBron played just 28 minutes in a game that was competitive in the second half and in normal circumstances would see him burn minutes until the buzzer. An ankle sprain certainly played a role in LeBron getting an early night off \u2014 he expects to play on Christmas Day, so fear not \u2014 but the Lakers, understandably and wisely, aren\u2019t taking any unnecessary risks. Because of that, there\u2019s a chance the Lakers won\u2019t put a priority on grabbing best record and the top seed, but in a season where fans probably won\u2019t be in arenas, at least not in abundance, does home court even matter in the post-season? LeBron had 22 points and Davis 18, tame by their standards, but again, those two were guaranteed to be on the floor for long stretches only for the ring ceremony. The short turnaround between seasons forced LeBron to completely change his prep schedule, and he\u2019s still dizzy from all the alterations. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a routine of how I prepare to go into a season,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just so much uncertainty (about) when we\u2019re going to start the season, and how we would start the season. Just a lot. Too much to kind of grasp, but we\u2019re in it now. Just a lot to process.\u201d He added: \u201cIt felt weird having a basketball game. Look, we\u2019re happy we were able to get back on the floor, knowing what this season is going to entail, and it was a hell of a run for us. Now it\u2019s on to \u201920-21.\u201d The easy part was the ceremony; there was nothing to prepare for that except stand and smile, although even that was a bit hollow if not equally as satisfying as his others. About that pregame moment, given the death of Kobe, the three-month delay because of the virus and the three months in the Orlando bubble, LeBron said: \u201cIt was just a culmination for what we been through, so many ups and downs, so many things that happened both good and bad for our franchise. We managed to bring it into all one moment and be able to celebrate that moment with my teammates and franchise. It was a cool moment, but to be without our family, they\u2019ve been part of that sacrifice as well.\u201d The Lakers lost the regular season series to the Clippers in 2019-20 and now trail 0-1 this season because Paul George dropped 33 points and was especially dangerous in the second half, getting 26. It was a reversal of fortune for George compared to how he played in the playoffs against the Nuggets, when the Clippers blew a 3-1 lead and George was particularly dreadful in Game Seven, going scoreless in the fourth quarter. The Lakers didn\u2019t exactly seem worried after the first of 72 games. Davis said: \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to get back into the swing of things. Still trying to figure each other out and things out, lineup and schemes and things like that.\u201d At least the Laker newcomers, the ones who didn\u2019t get rings, announced their arrival rather loudly. Dennis Schroder and Montrezl Harrell each had moments, with Schroder nearly getting a triple-double in just 28 minutes, while Harrell had 17 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. \u201cThose guys going to be big time players for us,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel. \u201cBoth of them are winning players and will be tremendous for us this year.\u201d With LeBron and Davis being fitted for a short leash, at least for the near future, the Lakers could use that help from the supporting cast. That doesn\u2019t mean the goal or the motivation to achieve it will change. That\u2019s something else the Lakers took from getting their rings. \u201cThat thing is heavier than I thought,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you cherish forever. It holds so much value to me as a basketball player. It\u2019s an accomplishment. Everyone doesn\u2019t get to say they have one of these. It reminds me of what we\u2019ve done, what I\u2019ve done. And I want another one. It definitely makes you want to get another one.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

And while they put the blindingly brilliant jewelry on their fingers, the Lakers promised to hold a real party for their 17th championship as soon as everyone can attend. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a second to speak directly to Lakers fans: We miss you so much,\u201d Lakers owner Jeanie Buss said. \u201cThe team misses you, but someday soon, we\u2019ll be together. And when we are together, we have something special to celebrate.\u201d Just 72 days after LeBron James, Anthony Davis and their teammates finished off the Miami Heat in the NBA bubble, the Lakers returned from the shortest offseason in league history to get their reward. The coaches, executives and 11 returning players from last season\u2019s championship team received their rings at Staples Center in a brief, warm ceremony before their regular season opener against the Los Angeles Clippers. The raising of the banner honoring their 17th championship is going to wait until fans are in Staples Center to enjoy it with them. The spot where it will hang eventually on the arena walls is currently occupied by a black banner reading: \u201cSTAY TUNED, LAKERS FAMILY.\u201d The ring presentations observed social distancing measures that seemed totally appropriate for 2020. The families of the Lakers\u2019 players and coaches appeared in short, heartfelt videos of introduction before the players walked up to an individual podium to grab the rings by themselves. Lakers get their championship rings before talking on the Clippers. Davis was cheered on by his parents, who expressed their pride in all of his basketball accomplishments. James\u2019 mother, uncles and children virtually congratulated him before he claimed his ring and joyously held up four fingers in honor of his four NBA titles with three franchises. When general manager Rob Pelinka put his ring on his right hand, he threw up a 2 and 4 with his fingers in honor of Kobe Bryant. \u201cYou showed last year what a talented group of individuals can accomplish if they buy into being a team,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel told his players. \u201cTo our fans, we cannot wait until it is safe enough for you guys to be back at Staples Center so we can perform in front of you and celebrate all this stuff with you guys. We thank you and we love you.\u201d Jason of Beverly Hills, the Lakers\u2019 traditional jeweler, created the rings, just as he did for the 2009 and 2010 championship teams led by Bryant, Pau Gasol and coach Phil Jackson. James and Davis led the Lakers to the title in the NBA\u2019s Florida bubble during the first season of their West Coast partnership, making a 16-5 postseason run to James\u2019 fourth championship and Davis\u2019 first. But the Lakers made no secret of their disappointment at celebrating their entire offseason without fans, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. They didn\u2019t get a parade in downtown Los Angeles, and no fans were in the Staples stands to cheer in recognition of the franchise\u2019s sixth championship since the downtown building opened in 1999. \u201cThese are obviously highly unusual times and a very different ring ceremony without fans,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cTo the Laker fans, we\u2019re going to make it up to you. We\u2019ll do this again when the fans are in the building.\u201d Buss and Vogel also made sure to thank the Lakers who moved on during the brief offseason: JaVale McGee, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo, Avery Bradley, JR Smith, Dion Waiters, Troy Daniels and DeMarcus Cousins. \u201cWinning No. 17 means you are forever a part of the Lakers legacy, just as you are forever a part of ours,\u201d Buss said. And at least one member of the Miami Heat \u2014 Bradley, who passed on joining the Lakers in the bubble last summer citing family health concerns and then signed with the Lakers\u2019 NBA Finals opponent in the offseason \u2014 was eager to see the Lakers\u2019 ring celebration. Bradley said he would be watching the ceremony on television. The Heat were in Orlando on Tuesday night, preparing for their opener their Wednesday against the Magic. \u201cI was actually texting Kyle Kuzma this morning,\u201d Bradley said Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty excited about the ceremony. I\u2019m excited for those guys. \u2026 There was a lot of work I put in last year with that team and it\u2019ll be a memory that I have forever.\u201d Bradley has been sized for a ring, though wasn\u2019t clear Tuesday exactly when he would receive the jewelry. The Heat visit the Lakers on Feb. 20, which might be the logical time for Bradley to get the ring."},{"id":454780,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-love-to-miss-season-opener-with-calf-strain","date":"2020-12-23","title":"Cavaliers' Love to miss season opener with calf strain","content":"CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers forward Kevin Love will miss the season opener on Wednesday night against Charlotte because of a strained right calf. The team officially ruled Love out on Tuesday, hours after Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he was preparing not to have the five-time All-Star in the lineup. Love got hurt during the first preseason game against Indiana earlier this month. He missed Cleveland\u2019s next three games and hasn\u2019t been cleared to practice. Larry Nance Jr. will likely start in place of Love, who has said he felt physically refreshed as he enters his 13th season. \u201cIt\u2019s best to just move Larry in that spot and increase his minutes and his workload,\u201d Bickerstaff said last week. \u201cObviously, if Kevin is out, we will have to play some small ball. But I think to start games and the majority of the minutes, I think it\u2019s a good thing to just move Larry because he\u2019s got a similar skill set, his ability to pass the ball and all those things.\u201d The 32-year-old Love is seven points shy of 13,000 in his career. He\u2019ll soon become the ninth player in league history to have 13,000 points, 7,000 rebounds and 1,000 3-pointers, joining a list that includes Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. The Cavs, who went 5-6 under Bickerstaff before their 2019-2020 was interrupted and finally ended by the COVID-19 pandemic, will also be without second-year swingman Kevin Porter Jr. He hasn\u2019t joined the team since having some off-the-court issues.

Tatum also said the NBA\u2019s season-opening doubleheader Tuesday night would be shown in China on Tencent, a league streaming partner. But the coronavirus pandemic is preventing the league from playing any games outside the U.S. this season, except possibly a return by the Toronto Raptors to Canada \u2014 something that won\u2019t happen before March at the earliest. Typically, the NBA has played preseason games in China and takes some regular-season games to Mexico and Europe. This season\u2019s plans called for a game in Paris, though the pandemic forced those to be tabled. \u201cWe do anticipate that once it becomes healthy and safe to be able to do that that we\u2019ll return to a schedule of international preseason and regular-season games,\u201d Tatum said on a call with international reporters. NBA games were available on Tencent last season even while the league and the Chinese government worked through a very strained relationship \u2014 an October 2019 tweet by then-Houston general manager Daryl Morey showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong prompted major fallout, including state broadcaster CCTV not showing any NBA games for a full year. CCTV put the NBA back on its channel lineup for the last two games of the NBA Finals last fall. Commissioner Adam Silver said at the All-Star break this past February that the league\u2019s issues with China would lead to perhaps as much as $400 million in lost revenue \u2014 and that was before the pandemic struck and led to even more revenue missed leaguewide. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we have a long history in China, a more than 40-year history of doing business in China, and that we remain committed to people-to-people exchange with the hundreds of millions of fans that we have there,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cPlaying global games has been and will continue to be an important part of how we engage with our fans in China and in other parts of the world, as well.\u201d Tatum\u2019s comments came on the day the NBA revealed its roster breakdown of international players for this season; 107 such players from 41 countries made opening-night rosters, including a record 17 Canadian players and a record-tying 14 African players. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the quantity of the players but the quality,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cThese are some of the best players in the game.\u201d That list includes Greece\u2019s two-time reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of Milwaukee, Slovenia\u2019s Luka Doncic of Dallas, Serbia\u2019s Nikola Jokic of Denver, and Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam and Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid \u2014 both from Cameroon. The NBA regular season is scheduled to run through mid-May, with the playoffs going from May 22 through July 22. That has led to much speculation about NBA players being able to participate in the Olympics, which open in Tokyo on July 23. There are 24 nations \u2014 Greece, Canada, Serbia and Slovenia among them \u2014 scheduled to compete starting in late June for the final four spots in the Olympic men\u2019s tournament. Japan, the U.S., Argentina, Iran, Nigeria, France, Spain and Australia have already qualified. Tatum said the NBA is working closely with the International Olympic Committee and FIBA, the sport\u2019s global governing body, to ensure there is \u201cthe best possible schedule for everybody involved.\u201d And it\u2019s possible that the finalizing of Olympic rosters could be pushed back to allow NBA players the maximum amount of time before making decisions on whether to play or not. \u201cIt\u2019s my expectation that our federation, FIBA, together with the IOC, will also work with us on potential accommodations, even in terms of when rosters would otherwise need to be submitted, recognizing that they\u2019re going to need to be more flexible and work with us this season given how much uncertainty there is around the virus,\u201d Silver said earlier this week."},{"id":454522,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-12-22","date":"2020-12-22","title":"FanDuel DFS Values of the Night: December 22","content":"See below for a breakdown of value plays for tonight\u2019s slate of games on Fan Duel by FantasyPros . Patrick Beverly (LAC) vs. Lakers: $4,200 Tonight\u2019s slate of point guards is ridiculously top-heavy, meaning you\u2019ll want to play one (or both) of Stephen Curry and\/or Kyrie Irving in addition to a cheaper option. The two players you can reasonably spend down on here are Lou Williams and Patrick Beverley, but Beverley comes in over $1,000 cheaper. He\u2019s not an adept scorer, but he can sometimes stuff the stat sheet with defensive numbers and assists to bolster his fantasy value. Spencer Dinwiddie (BKN) vs. Warriors: $5,200 After a huge 2019-20 season, it\u2019s a new world for Dinwiddie, who will have to contend with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant for usage. Still, Dinwiddie should see plenty of minutes as Brooklyn\u2019s starting two guard, and with a great matchup against Golden State on tap, Dinwiddie is a fine value at just $5.2K. Dennis Schroder (LAL) vs. Clippers: $5,000 Schroder will start the season in the Lakers\u2019 starting lineup, where he\u2019s poised to be a consistent factor on offense. The veteran guard averaged 18.9 points with the Thunder last season \u2013 the second-highest mark of his career. In 65 games played in 2019-20, Schroder scored at least 20 points in 35 of them. He\u2019s got plenty of offensive upside, and with the Clippers\u2019 defense likely honed in on LeBron James and Anthony Davis, Schroder should get his share of opportunities in the season opener. Luke Kennard (LAC) vs. Lakers: $4,000 If you\u2019re looking to really set your lineups apart, Kennard could provide some high-quality scoring off the bench. It\u2019s clear the Clippers have a plan for him after signing him to a 4-year\/$64 million extension earlier in the week. Small Forward Nicolas Batum (LAC) vs. Lakers: $3,500 Batum latched on with the Clippers and figures to see some regular minutes off the bench this season. He could be in line for a starting role for the season opener, as Marcus Morris (knee) is questionable. If Batum is given the spot start, he makes a fine salary-saving option for tonight\u2019s slate. Joe Harris (BKN) vs. Warriors: $4,300 Harris will be back with Brooklyn in a starting roll after re-upping with the squad in the offseason. The Virginia product had the best season of his career in 2019-20 when he averaged 14.5 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.5 triples, and 2.1 assists. His role will likely decline with Irving and Durant back in the fold, but Harris can heat up from downtown with the best of them. If you\u2019re looking to save some coin and get some scoring upside, Harris is your man. Power Forward Eric Paschall (GSW) vs. Nets: $4,900 Draymond Green is officially out tonight, and Paschall should be in Golden State\u2019s starting lineup, where he makes an excellent value play. He excelled as a rookie last season and averaged 17.0 points, 5.7 boards, and 1.7 dimes across 26 starts. Serge Ibaka (LAC) vs. Lakers: $5,500 Ibaka will open the season as the Clippers\u2019 starting center, but he gets the benefit of PF eligibility on FanDuel. The matchup with the Lakers isn\u2019t an especially favorable one, but if Marcus Morris is forced to miss this one, opportunities should abound in the Clippers\u2019 frontcourt. Center Jarrett Allen (BKN) vs. Warriors: $4,800 The highest priced center on tonight\u2019s slate is just $5,100, so there are plenty of values to be had. Montrezl Harrell should be a popular choice at that price, but we\u2019ll pivot to two cheaper options. First up, it\u2019s Jarrett Allen, Brooklyn\u2019s reasonably-priced starting center. He averaged career highs in points, rebounds, and assists last season, and he finished the season strong by averaging 12.6 points, 13.9 boards, and 1.9 blocks across his final seven games. Allen\u2019s got a great matchup with Golden State\u2019s soft frontcourt defense (that will be without Draymond Green tonight), and he makes an excellent play at just $4.8K. Marc Gasol (LAL) vs. Clippers: $3,800 The Lakers figure to give both Harrell and Marc Gasol meaningful minutes this season, and at just $3.8K, Gasol makes an interesting, low-cost option who probably won\u2019t be highly rostered. He\u2019s in the twilight of his career, but the veteran can still make an impact across the board with his ability to score, rebound, facilitate, and score from long range.

(AP) \u2014 Just like last year, the Toronto Raptors are opening the season at home, against the New Orleans Pelicans, and every available ticket for the game has been sold. It\u2019s exactly the same. And entirely different. The Tampa era \u2014 it\u2019ll last until at least early March, maybe the full season, nobody knows for certain yet \u2014 of Raptors basketball formally opens Wednesday night, when the team plays host to the Pelicans. Unlike last season, when more than 20,000 fans crammed into Scotiabank Arena on opening night, Wednesday\u2019s matchup is expected to draw a socially distanced 3,800, the maximum permitted right now at Tampa\u2019s Amalie Arena according to the health and safety protocols put in to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. For the Raptors, it feels like home. It looks like home. It is home, for now. \u201cWe are all creatures of habit. Familiarity is where we thrive,\u201d said Teresa Resch, the Raptors\u2019 vice president of basketball operations and one of the guiding forces behind the team\u2019s move to Tampa. \u201cAnd the more familiar you can make it, the more comfortable you are, the better you are able to perform and ultimately that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do here is we\u2019re trying to grow as an organization and perform our best.\u201d The Raptors and those who are assisting them in Tampa have tried to simulate the comforts the team has at home in Toronto, at least as much as possible. \u201cWe The North\u201d signage is everywhere in the hotel that the Raptors will use as a practice facility, from the elevator doors to the ballroom wall behind one of the baskets. The court that the Raptors will use for games came from Toronto. And there\u2019s a 2019 world championship banner swaying from the rafters \u2014 alongside the Tampa Bay Lightning\u2019s retired jerseys for Vincent Lecavalier and Martin St. Louis \u2014 at the same end of the court as the Raptors\u2019 bench. The banner immediately caught the eye of Raptors coach Nick Nurse when he checked out the surroundings. \u201cHey, the banner! It\u2019s kind of cool,\u201d Nurse said. The Raptors needed a new home because the U.S.-Canada border remains closed to almost all non-essential crossings because of the pandemic. Many cities lobbied; Tampa wound up being the pick in a move that added to a hectic sports year for the city which has seen the NHL\u2019s Lightning win the Stanley Cup, baseball\u2019s Rays reach the World Series and the NFL\u2019s Buccaneers land Tom Brady in a season where Tampa also plays host to the Super Bowl. \u201cThe Toronto Raptors and their fans will not be disappointed here in Tampa Bay,\u201d Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said The last time Tampa was on the NBA\u2019s schedule prior to this season was in 2010, when Miami and Orlando were supposed to meet there in a preseason game. The matchup wound up getting canceled shortly before game time because someone used an oil-based soap to clean the court and things got slippery. This is already off to a better start. The Raptors are raving about the arena setup. The practice facility, constructed in a hotel ballroom \u2014 very similar to what the NBA put into use during the summer restart at Walt Disney World \u2014 has many of the same things that the team has in Toronto. The Raptor mascot is performing at games, the starting lineups are announced the same way, and Nurse can walk to work now, which he enjoys. \u201cThey did a great job with the facility,\u201d Raptors guard Fred VanVleet said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a mixture of what we have in Toronto and what we experienced in the bubble. We kind of got brainwashed into practicing in ballrooms in the bubble and it became normal for us. This doesn\u2019t feel all that different but it\u2019s nice to see all of our Raptors stuff in here. They did a great job. \u201cThere\u2019s little things that we don\u2019t have that we do at home \u2026 but the people who put this together did a great job.\u201d This endeavor is not without hardship. There are about 60 employees who moved from Toronto to Tampa, some with families, some without. Some arena workers in Toronto, who obviously haven\u2019t had their game-night jobs since March, still don\u2019t have them. And the move is costing the Raptors a small fortune; the NBA has some experience with helping in the scenario of a team being displaced \u2014 the last time it happened was in 2005-06 and 2006-07 when the New Orleans Hornets played in Oklahoma City following Hurricane Katrina \u2014 and will almost certainly cover some of those costs. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he expects other team owners to support Toronto and what he called its \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d \u201cOne thing wonderful about this league is that while the 30 teams\u2019 goal is to crush each other on the court, off the court they\u2019re business partners,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI think it\u2019s sort of the secret sauce behind the league\u2019s success over the last decade in particular, sort of a generation of owners who are really fond of each other and want to work to support one another.\u201d So, for now, \u201cWe The North\u201d has gone south. At least 17 times in the next 2 \u00bd months, the Raptors will be calling a court in Tampa home. They\u2019re determined to make it work. \u201cIt\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but you have to make lemonade out of lemons,\u201d Resch said. \u201cWe would love to be playing in Toronto and playing in front of Toronto fans but we\u2019re not. We\u2019re here in Tampa. And you know what? We\u2019ve got a beautiful arena, there\u2019s beautiful sun. There\u2019s definitely lemonade.\u201d"},{"id":454364,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gordon-hayward-available-to-play-in-hornets-season-opener","date":"2020-12-22","title":"Gordon Hayward available to play in Hornets' season opener","content":"Charlotte Hornets forward Gordon Hayward says he will be available to play in the team\u2019s season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.

Beasley pleaded guilty to a felony count of threats of violence and faces 120 days in a workhouse, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement. As part of the plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop a felony fifth-degree drug possession charge. The voicemail for Beasley\u2019s attorney, Ryan Pacyga, was full and not accepting messages. The complaint said a couple on a house-hunting tour last month with their 13-year-old child pulled up to the home rented by Beasley and his wife, Montana Yao, but saw it was roped off. Beasley tapped on the window of the family\u2019s SUV, pointed a rifle at them and told them to get off his property, prosecutors said. Police said they searched Beasley and Yao\u2019s home and found a 12-gauge shotgun, a handgun and an automatic rifle that matched the description given by the couple in the SUV. Police said they also found leafy marijuana in the home. Possessing marijuana in its original leafy form is illegal in Minnesota. Yao was charged with fifth-degree drug possession. Her next court appearance is Dec. 29.

The process of discovery the league experienced in the spring and summer has begun anew. The NBA led the way for many in the culture \u2014 not just its 30 franchises \u2014 into the virus shutdown last March when it suspended the 2019-20 season. Four months later, it orchestrated and pulled off the Orlando bubble format, completing the playoffs and crowning the Lakers as 2020 champions with zero coronavirus cases on Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex. Now, under NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s guidance with the support of the league\u2019s Board of Governors, the NBA is leading the way again in navigating day-to-day life and business with COVID-19 still very much in play. The schedule will be a little shorter (72 games), fans largely will be absent from the arenas, vaccines are only now rolling out, and the whole bold enterprise is so uncertain that the second half of the regular season hasn\u2019t even been announced. Yet by calculating the risks, going belt-and-suspenders on safety protocols and keeping fingers crossed, Silver and the league \u2013 in partnership with the National Basketball Players Association \u2013 are confident they can see through the 2020-21 season, which opens Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked many times, \u2018Why are you starting your season now, given the current state of the pandemic?\u2019 It\u2019s a fair question,\u201d Silver said in a media teleconference Monday afternoon. \u201cThe short answer is that we\u2019re comfortable with the health and safety protocols that we\u2019ve designed in consultation with the Players Association and our medical experts, plus we would not be opening the season if we didn\u2019t believe it was safe and responsible to do so.\u201d But Silver added: \u201cWe\u2019d be making a huge mistake if we didn\u2019t remain humble.\u201d That especially applies to the introduction of fans into arenas, to restore the live-event element not just for ticket buyers but also for a more legitimate semblance of home-court atmosphere. Six teams \u2013 Atlanta, Cleveland, New Orleans, Orlando, Toronto (Tampa) and Utah \u2013 have announced they will begin play with a limited number of people in attendance. City health mandates are guiding those efforts, with the NBA monitoring closely. Silver again estimated that in-person attendance accounts for as much as 40 percent of league revenue, so getting fans back into the stands is a priority. \u201cI think that as we get our sea legs, with some teams bringing in fans, other markets see the success we hope \u2026 it\u2019ll mean that we can begin having more fans in our buildings,\u201d he said. The widespread distribution of vaccines against COVID-19 obviously would aid in that ambition. The estimates of some medical officials that a critical mass of vaccinations could be achieved by March or April would enable the NBA, with its shifted calendar, to really open arena doors for playoffs that are scheduled to begin in May. \u201cEven when you talk to our players, when we were all down in Orlando, I mean, they desperately missed it,\u201d Silver said of live crowds. (He made a point to say that the league would not \u201cjump the line\u201d for vaccines. In the bubble, the NBA even having access to the number of daily tests needed was a touchy subject for some critics.) While many players, coaches, staff and owners mostly felt relieved when the bubble held from July into October, the NBA was lauded by many for how it brought the concept to fruition. This time, travel and participants interacting daily with family, friends and strangers across pandemic lines are just two of the new wrinkles. Individual positive tests are going to be treated a lot like ankle sprains or groin pulls, with players sidelined until they\u2019re deemed healthy enough to return. It\u2019s the bigger bumps in the road that will seize the league\u2019s attention, potentially including even suspensions of play, though an exact trigger for such a seismic measure hasn\u2019t been specified. \u201cIf we found a situation where our protocols weren\u2019t working,\u201d Silver said, \u201cmeaning that not only did we have some cases of COVID but that we were witnessing spread either among teams or even possibly to another team, that would cause us to suspend the season.\u201d As it did with the bubble restart, the NBA weighed health and safety considerations with the economic impact of losing the 2020 playoffs on its teams, its broadcast partners and the \u201ctens of thousands of jobs that are dependent on the league,\u201d Silver said. But the commissioner added: \u201cThe decision tree that we will look at in terms of suspending the season will be solely a health and safety one. If at any point we no longer believe that it is responsible to play, we will halt the season.\u201d Silver and a group of NBA executives participated in the teleconference, fielding questions on a variety of topics. Among them: \u2022 The Toronto Raptors\u2019 relocation to Tampa, Fla., for at least the first half of this season will bring all sorts of unexpected costs. The other 29 teams likely will reimburse them, Silver said. Teams that generate some gate receipts, he added, won\u2019t specifically share that money with teams with empty stands. But the NBA\u2019s standard revenue-sharing system would smooth out some inequities from that. \u2022 Teams, with a lone preseason exception, stood for the national anthem as per NBA tradition until the bubble games. Silver indicated he would like that to again be the norm going forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a national ritual of sorts that is something that I hope personally isn\u2019t lost,\u201d the commissioner said, \u201cbecause there are very few things that bring us together these days. It\u2019s my expectation going into the season that we\u2019re going to return to the practice that\u2019s been part of this league for many decades.\u201d Two developments may enable that, in showing the NBA and its players have moved beyond raising awareness to actually tackling substantive issues of social protest. First, Silver cited the NBA Foundation, which focuses on driving economic opportunity in the black community and received $300 million in initial funding from the teams. Last week, Greg Taylor was named executive director of the foundation and $2 million in inaugural grants were made to seven organizations. Silver also talked of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition , which sprang from the work stoppage during the first round of playoffs in Orlando. The board of governors, players and coaches held its first meeting last week, focusing on reforms in criminal justice, voting access and other areas. \u2022 The NBA\u2019s announcement that marijuana will not be subject to random testing this season will get further study and discussion with the union in time, Silver said. Acknowledging that jurisdictions in which teams travel this season have varying laws related to its use, he said, \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re not creating a trap for our players and putting in place rules that will put them in the crosshairs of the law.\u201d Silver added: \u201cWhile marijuana has been taken off our list for random testing, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t still a concern from the league that marijuana, no different than alcohol, can be abused, and that it\u2019s something that we want to play close attention to.\u201d \u2022 NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said that plans for a NBA G League season still are pending. One reported possibility suggested a bubble format in Atlanta for some number of the teams, starting perhaps in January and playing a significantly shortened schedule and playoffs. Top priorities include keeping G League players healthy and safe, while facilitating assignments up or down with their affiliated NBA teams and heeding any quarantine requirements. \u2022 Fans of the Milwaukee Bucks got an explanation of sorts for why their team, but not the Sacramento Kings, was disciplined for their role in the premature and scuttled sign-and-trade deal involving free agent Bogdan Bogdanovic. The Bucks were stripped of their 2022 second-round draft pick. NBA general counsel Rick Buchanan fielded that questions at Silver\u2019s request, explaining that the Bucks were seen as the instigators in pursuing Bogdanovic before teams were permitted by rule to begin discussions. It was not a tampering offense, he said, but rather \u201cjumping the gun,\u201d which the BOG specifically sought in 2019 to eliminate. Said Buchanan: \u201cHere the violation was that the team had conversations about a free agent contract with the representative for this player prior to the time when the CBA permitted them to do that, and as a result they were penalized.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They lost by 24 to the LA Clippers and dropped to 15-50, worst in the NBA. Last we saw the Brooklyn Nets, they surrendered 150 points to the Toronto Raptors, getting swept from the first round while their two best players with a combined 16 All-Star appearances watched from home. Last we saw the Clippers, they limped out of the playoffs, suffering from a fractured ego after blowing a 3-1 lead to the Denver Nuggets. Their coach was Doc Rivers, though not for long. And last we saw the Los Angeles Lakers, they danced in a rain of purple-and-gold confetti and LeBron James left the Orlando bubble with some priceless hardware: championship trophy, championship MVP trophy. The NBA certainly chose wisely when it scheduled these four teams to open the 2020-21 season, because circumstances conspired to make Warriors vs. Nets ( 7 p.m. ET, TNT ) and Lakers vs. Clippers ( 10 p.m. ET, TNT ) the most intriguing matchups in what promises to be a most intriguing season. The hook for these two games is succulent and straightforward and contains the following: Long-anticipated franchise player comebacks, simmering rivalry, winds of change, heart of a champion, a touch of desperation, a 17th banner for Staples Center and, of course, superstars galore. And this is just the start of a 72-game schedule that will bring the usual surprises and drama. Now that the preseason countdown is over, let\u2019s count the number of subplots on display Tuesday night when the NBA opens for business in Brooklyn and Los Angeles: The return of Kevin Durant. The league will welcome back a transcendent player who\u2019s been missing since the 2019 NBA Finals following Achilles surgery. The injury isn\u2019t a career-killer, thanks to modern medical science. Now we get to see how much, if anything, he lost in the process. His appearance in the preseason suggests KD is virtually the same lethal scorer as before, and besides, the motivation to play can only help the former Kia MVP. That, and the chance to lead a third team to The Finals should compel Durant to reclaim his spot among the game\u2019s best players. \u201cI keep telling him he\u2019s got to give himself 15 games before he starts judging himself,\u201d rookie Nets coach Steve Nash said. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta give himself 15-20 games. There\u2019s no way to finalize what he is, who he is, without playing NBA games. (But) I think he\u2019s going to be 100% Kevin Durant.\u201d KD vs. the championship team he bailed on. Rather than stay with a dynasty and remain teammates with Stephen Curry, Durant traveled his own path and left for Brooklyn. Not many players would do that, but Durant isn\u2019t most players. He\u2019s his own man, and now he has his own team. Whether he can have his own city \u2014 New York has been claimed by only a precious few sports icons \u2014 remains to be seen, especially with a franchise that, based on historical connection and popularity, cannot compare to the Knicks. He\u2019s missed in the Bay Area but only from a talent standpoint. Yes, KD helped the Warriors win two titles and advance to three Finals in his three years in town, but he was just passing through. The Warriors belong to Curry, the home-grown star. \u201cThere\u2019s no narrative at all,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a regular basketball game. I don\u2019t care too much about that drama that comes with that former team, all that stuff. I\u2019ve been through that with OKC, so I\u2019m not trying to do that with Golden State. I love everybody there. It\u2019s just another game.\u201d The KD-Kyrie connection. They plotted this collaboration months before making it official, but those plans were put on hold because of KD\u2019s injury. Now, the process begins: KD and Kyrie Irving, a pair of quirky stars who played major roles in previous championship victories with other teams and other superstar teammates. Both players are elite at shot creation and shot making, and can change any game, and are trusted with the ball in clutch moments. Together they make for high entertainment, and perhaps high drama as well depending on what mood Kyrie adopts on any given day. \u201cMe and [Durant] have a great relationship,\u201d Irving said, \u201cbut our synergy carries over to everyone else and we allow each other to teach, to learn. We had to wait a year and a half and it came to fruition. Our greatness is even better together.\u201d Stephen Curry and the burden he carries. Discounting his two-week cameo last season, Curry hasn\u2019t played a meaningful game since the summer of 2019. And now he must do so without KD and also Klay Thompson, who followed knee surgery with an Achilles injury and will miss a second straight season. This puts Curry on an island; not since his first few years with the Warriors has Curry lacked an All-Star scoring partner. There will be nights when he\u2019ll be asked to drop 40 points, and what\u2019s scary is Curry is still capable of that. He\u2019s a two-time MVP who\u2019ll need to return to that level if the Warriors insist on being on the upper-shelf in the West. \u201cFor what we have right now, I love where we\u2019re at,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI love the fact that we have enough pieces, enough talent and enough experience to surprise a lot of people this year and try to compete at the top of the West. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d James Wiseman and the extinction of the big man. For better or worse, the seismic shift from post play to perimeter play has drastically reduced the value of the big man. This much is true, with one caveat: A great big man (Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic, for instance) still holds lots of weight. His role remains in the paint, but he must at least be a threat from the outside. Wiseman can be that player. The No. 2 overall pick is raw and, until he develops, will do much of his damage for the Warriors near the rim. The good news for the 7-foot teenager is he\u2019s joining a good team, which rarely happens with players selected that high. He\u2019ll get his first NBA taste against DeAndre Jordan. \u201cI think one of the most exciting things for us about James is his intelligence, his willingness to learn and his ability to absorb lessons,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cBut I will again reiterate: It\u2019s one thing to scrimmage and it\u2019s another thing to be out on the floor against Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets. We have to temper our expectations and bring him along at a pace that will allow him to develop well.\u201d Andrew Wiggins gets a second chance to make a first impression. Wiggins is trying to escape a perception he helped create: A good player paid like he\u2019s great who still hasn\u2019t reached his potential, takes nights off, lacks intensity and is mainly a tease. Well, anyone on a team with Draymond Green will bust tail, or else. Plus, give Wiggins the benefit of the doubt for being older and wiser and, now that he\u2019s finally with a winner, better motivated by his surroundings. The Warriors are pleased by what they see thus far, even more if he plays well against KD. Paul George is ready to make amends. George is one of the few humans who took a trip to Disney and came away with a bad experience from start to finish. He wasn\u2019t the only reason the Clippers played poorly and finally collapsed in the second round of the bubble playoffs, but he was the symbol of that failure, shooting poorly throughout and especially in the Game 7 moment of truth against Denver. Then, months later, he signed a kind of mega extension with the Clippers that\u2019s usually given as a reward for a job well done. George is suddenly the rare star who has lots of prove. The national spotlight on him, starting with the season opener, will be severe. Kawhi Leonard wants to prove he made the right call. This probably isn\u2019t the right time to remind Kawhi he could\u2019ve signed with the Lakers last year and would most likely have another championship ring right now. Instead, he\u2019s steering the wobbly Clipper Ship, fresh off a postseason embarrassment. Kawhi remains a terrific two-way player, yet for a team that begs for leadership from its best player, he can\u2019t deliver, at least not vocally; it\u2019s not his style. This season will reflect on him, one way or another, and if it finishes much like last season, at least Kawhi hasn\u2019t signed that contract extension yet. And until he does, there\u2019s still time to join the Lakers if he so pleases next season. The Clippers and the uncomfortable ring ceremony. As if the Clippers need any further reminders of how rotten last year ended, they must endure the spectacle of the Lakers raising another banner to the ceiling in an area they share. Meanwhile, there\u2019s still no Clippers championship. At least they made changes perhaps for the better, with Serge Ibaka the most decorated of the offseason additions. It\u2019s now Ty Lue\u2019s turn to do what Doc Rivers couldn\u2019t: Help the Clippers finally get championship credibility. George said the opener against the Lakers \u201cwon\u2019t be the test of finding who we are, where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s the start of a marathon.\u201d LeBron James is still King until further notice. Season No. 17 finds LeBron a better 3-point shooter, better passer, more willing defender and still an efficient player. Also, he\u2019s an NBA champion coming off a stellar postseason. There is much pride in being nearly 36 and still on a high level and being the idol of teenage rookies who first picked up a basketball because of him. The goals from here are simple: Match or pass Michael Jordan for championships won and stick around long enough for when and if his oldest son, Bronny, arrives in the league. A new cast awaits the Lakers. Armed with few assets but plenty of cap space and a pair of aces, the Lakers made the most of their offseason, and more, by upgrading at nearly every position. The only questionable move was Marc Gasol at center; he\u2019s almost out of gas. Otherwise: Dennis Schroder, Wesley Matthews and Montrezl Harrell are replacing Rajon Rondo, Danny Green and JaVale McGee. Plus, it might be Talen Horton-Tucker\u2019s turn in the rotation. Anthony Davis is nobody\u2019s second option. If there were any questions about AD before he arrived with the Lakers, they\u2019ve been effectively squashed. He was a force on a team that won a title; nothing else needs to be said or proven. And there were times when he was the best player on a floor shared with LeBron. AD\u2019s ability to defend and shut down multiple positions and also have a major impact offensively puts him on an island shared by only Giannis Antetokounmpo. When the Lakers meet the Clippers in the opener, you will see the difference between the \u201cNo. 2s.\u201d \u201cI want to win at the highest level, and AD wants to do the same,\u201d James said. \u201cHe wants to be one of the best, and we know that championships are the holy grail in this league. To be crowned a champion, to become multiple champions, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Adam Silver sees no reason why the same cannot ring true again this season. Silver, the the NBA\u2019s Commissioner, said Monday \u2014 one day before the new season begins \u2014 that he is confident the league\u2019s health and safety protocols will allow teams to get through their planned 72-game regular season slates even as the coronavirus problem rages across the country and the world. He did, however, warn that he expects the virus to create some problems along the way. \u201cI think we are prepared for isolated cases; in fact, based on what we\u2019ve seen in the preseason, based on watching other leagues operating outside a bubble, unfortunately, it seems somewhat inevitable,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared for all contingencies.\u201d Games could be postponed or canceled along the way, and Silver said that if the league encounters issues that cannot be controlled by what\u2019s covered in the health and safety protocols suspending the season \u2014 just as was the case back on March 11, when the 2019-20 season was halted for 4 \u00bd months \u2014 will again be a possibility. But the league, Silver vowed, will wait its turn to get players and others inside the NBA vaccinated against the coronavirus. \u201cIn no form or way will we jump the line,\u201d Silver said. Silver spoke on the eve of the season-opening doubleheader \u2014 Golden State visiting Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Clippers playing against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. He said if the league didn\u2019t believe in its plans, the season simply would not be starting. \u201cWe do anticipate that there will be bumps in the road along the way,\u201d Silver said. Teams will play 10 fewer games than the customary 82-game slate. The season is starting two months later than usual and the playoffs are set to stretch into July, all with players and coaches being tested daily and with nearly 60 players having already missed some time with their teams during training camp and the preseason because of positive COVID-19 tests. And as was the case at Disney, social justice initiatives remain top priorities for the league, Silver said. The efforts will be different now \u2014 for example, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is no longer painted onto game courts, a change from what was the case in the bubble. But the commissioner stressed that fighting racial inequality is no less important now than it was then. \u201cI think there\u2019s also been in a new awakening among the players in the league as to the impact they can have when they use the platforms they have to speak out on issues that are important to them,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s a combination of the collective action that the league will be taking together with its players and coaches, and on top of that players realizing the enormous reach they have with their voices.\u201d Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said last week that he expects the league to continue driving conversation about the need for societal change. \u201cFor myself, it\u2019s all about action. It\u2019s all about doing it,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIt may not say it on the court or it may not say it on our jerseys or on the back of the jerseys, but it resonates when you\u2019re doing things in your communities, to uplift your communities and to uplift other people. So that\u2019s a big thing, is continuing, yourself, to make it matter.\u201d The NBA currently expects only six of its 30 teams to open the season with fans in the stands, and no arena is planning to have more than 4,000 ticketholders in the seats at this point. Smaller attendance means smaller revenue, and the league missed its revenue projection by about $1.5 billion last season \u2014 largely because many games were canceled and the bubble games, including the playoffs, were played without fans in the seats. Silver said playing another season without fans would mean NBA revenue would dip about 40%. \u201cTens of thousands of people rely on our league and its related businesses for their livelihoods,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe also feel a responsibility to our fans. People continue to look at sports as a break from the challenges of the pandemic and as a small reminder of what life was like before COVID-19. \u2026 It\u2019s a piece of life I feel we\u2019re able to get back, for the time being.\u201d"},{"id":453566,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/handful-of-young-stars-rewarded-with-lucrative-contract-extensions","date":"2020-12-22","title":"Handful of young stars rewarded with lucrative contract extensions","content":"For some young NBA players, a free-agency payday came early Monday. Orlando signed Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz to extensions, while San Antonio did the same with Derrick White and Toronto with OG Anunoby. All four could have been restricted free agents next summer, and their teams had until Monday to get new deals done with those players. The deals all begin with the 2021-22 season. Isaac ($80 million), White and Anunoby ($72 million) each received four-year extensions. Fultz got a three-year extension worth $50 million. The terms of the deals for Issac, Anunoby and Fultz, each of them first reported by ESPN, were confirmed to The Associated Press by people with knowledge of the negotiations. The people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because terms of the deals were not publicly announced. ESPN reported White\u2019s deal to be worth $73 million. \u201cWe are thrilled to keep both Markelle and Jonathan in a Magic uniform,\u201d Magic President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman said. \u201cThey both have a very bright future and they mean a lot to our organization, both on and off the court.\u201d Fultz, the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, averaged 12.1 points and 5.1 assists for the Magic last season. Isaac averaged 11.9 points and 6.8 rebounds for the Magic a year ago, having his season interrupted by a left knee bone bruise \u2014 and then seeing his season ended when he tore the ACL in that same knee during a game in the bubble in August. Isaac is not expected to play this season. Anunoby averaged career-bests of 10.6 points and 5.3 rebounds while becoming a full-time starter for the Raptors last season. \u201cOG is the epitome of the skilled, powerful, determined player we want in our organization long-term. Remember, he doesn\u2019t shoot to miss,\u201d Raptors general manager Bobby Webster said. \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased that OG will be with us for seasons to come.\u201d White averaged 11.3 points for the Spurs last season. He was one of the guards selected to USA Basketball\u2019s 12-player roster for the Basketball World Cup in China in 2019. Many top-tier free agents who could have hit the market next summer have also signed new deals in recent days, including two-time reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo with Milwaukee, LeBron James and Anthony Davis with the defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers, Rudy Gobert with Utah and Paul George with the Los Angeles Clippers. Other signees of big extensions that start next season included Bam Adebayo with Miami, Jayson Tatum with Boston, Donovan Mitchell with Utah and De\u2019Aaron Fox with Sacramento."},{"id":453545,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-sign-derrick-white-to-contract-extension","date":"2020-12-22","title":"Spurs sign Derrick White to contract extension","content":"SAN ANTONIO \u2013 The San Antonio Spurs today announced that they have signed guard Derrick White to a contract extension.

Also entering his third year and an Eastern Conference All-Star starter last season, Young put up 29.6 points, 9.3 assists, 4.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 35.3 minutes (.437 FG%, .361 3FG%, .860 FT%) in 60 starts, ranking second in the NBA in assists, fourth in scoring, 10 th in minutes and 26 th in free-throw percentage. Young led the Eastern Conference in assists for the second straight season and hit double digits in scoring 57 times, including 49 contests with at least 20 points.

Young, the fifth overall pick in 2018, was a unanimous selection to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2018-19. As a rookie last season, Hunter averaged 12.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 32.0 minutes (.410 FG%, .355 3FG%, .764 FT%). Among qualifying rookies, he ranked first in minutes per game, fifth in free-throw percentage, tied for fifth in three-point percentage, sixth in rebounding, seventh in field goal percentage and tied for seventh in scoring. He scored in double-figures 42 times, including eight games with 20-or-more, and recorded 15 games with at least three three-pointers, the third-highest total by a rookie in Hawks history. The fourth overall pick in 2019, he is one of three rookies in league history to reach 12.0 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.8 apg, 32.0 mpg and 100 triples on .350 3FG% (Stephen Curry, Shane Battier). Reddish averaged 10.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.1 steals in 26.7 minutes as a rookie last season. Among qualifying first-year players, he ranked second in steals per game, ninth in minutes per game, three-point percentage and blocks per game, 11 th in points and rebounds per game. He placed second among rookies in steals (62) and had at least eight games with three steals, the second-highest total among rookies. The 10 th overall pick in 2019, Reddish was also one of three rookies last season to compile at least 100 FTM (101) and 80 3FGM (83)."},{"id":453407,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-agree-to-contract-extension-with-og-anunoby","date":"2020-12-21","title":"Raptors ink contract extension with OG Anunoby","content":"The Toronto Raptors announced Monday they have signed forward OG Anunoby to a multi-year contract extension.

His impression is also unique in that it spans from coast to coast on the NBA map. Though made by the same man, each step is markedly distinct. After his as-great-as-advertised beginning in Cleveland, James rode his groundbreaking \u201cDecision\u201d to Miami. It was the precursor to the superstar player movement that would follow, but in the moment it was easy to over-analyze. James bore the weight of the scrutiny \u2014 and won two titles, two Kia MVPs and two Finals MVPs anyway. > Celebrate the Dec. 22 season tipoff with first-ever NBA Jersey Day Mission accomplished in Miami, James returned his attention to his original team. His second stint in his home state broke Cleveland\u2019s sports curse in dramatic fashion, punctuated by a historic rally from a 3-1 Finals deficit in 2016 against the most successful regular-season team ever. But after Golden State reloaded with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving left Cleveland, James found himself looking West when free agency loomed in 2018. Now he is a Laker, a much more meaningful statement after leading L.A. to the 2020 championship and \u2014 perhaps just as importantly \u2014 serving as the team\u2019s superstar ambassador following the passing of Kobe Bryant. There is little doubt that each of those three franchises \u2014 Cleveland, Miami, and Los Angeles \u2014 will retire James\u2019 number whenever his absurdly accomplished career comes to a close. Assuming that happens, he will join an elect few who are so honored in more than one city. Unlike the Bill Russells, Magic Johnsons and Dirk Nowitzkis of the world, most of these were legends whose careers brushed their teams more briefly, but left indelible marks on each of them just the same. Number retired by: Bucks (No. 33), Lakers (No. 33) Still the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer and almost underrated when it comes to GOAT debates, Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s early days in Milwaukee have been timely revived thanks to the Bucks\u2019 recent ascent. The 7-foot-2 superstar was known as Lew Alcindor when he led a three-year-old franchise to the 1971 championship while seizing Finals MVP honors. After adopting his Muslim name, Abdul-Jabbar went on to earn three MVPs and lead the Bucks to the \u201974 Finals, where they lost to the Celtics in a classic seven-game series. Abdul-Jabbar requested a trade in 1975, a wish that saw him sent to the Lakers. Three more MVP awards and five championships as the big man of the \u201cShowtime\u201d era cemented his status as one of the all-time greats, as did his passing Wilt Chamberlain for the career scoring record. Now, Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s iconic No. 33 graces the rafters of the franchises that saw him sink one sky-hook after another with an easy dominance no one has ever been able to duplicate.  Number retired by: 76ers (No. 34), Suns (No. 34) \u201cThe Round Mound of Rebound\u201d is widely recognized for his current television work, but proof of his on-court speed and strength still raises eyebrows two decades after his final season as a player. For eight seasons, Barkley bulldozed past, around or through opposing defenders for Philadelphia, putting up numbers and highlights that are mind-boggling to this day. Though he was unable to help the 76ers retain their championship standing once the old guard retired, Barkley is still an undisputed legend there. Change was ultimately needed for both sides, however, and Barkley was eventually traded to Phoenix in 1992. It was there, alongside All-Stars Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle, that \u201cSir Charles\u201d tasted meaningful postseason success. The 1992-93 NBA MVP led the Suns through a grueling Western Conference to The Finals, where his team matched Michael Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls point-for-point (640-640) and came within one possession of forcing a Game 7. Barkley\u2019s No. 34 is retired in Philadelphia and enshrined in the Suns\u2019 Ring of Honor.  Numbers retired by: Warriors (No. 13), 76ers (No. 13), Lakers (No. 13) Perhaps the most dominant well-traveled superstar before LeBron, Chamberlain is a near-constant reference point when current players produce an absurd statistical performance. \u201cThe Big Dipper\u201d was even more overwhelming than expected, winning MVP honors in his rookie season and averaging 50.4 ppg and 25.7 rpg in his third season with the Philadelphia Warriors. Chamberlain did not taste the ultimate team success, however, until after being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers from the Warriors, who had since moved to San Francisco. In 1966-67, Wilt\u2019s scoring average dipped below 30 points for the first time in his career \u2014 and the 76ers upended his ultimate competitor in Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics for the championship. Chamberlain won the MVP three seasons in a row with the Sixers, too. A season later, Chamberlain was on the move again, this time to join forces with fellow legends Jerry West and Elgin Baylor on the Lakers for the 1968-69 campaign. Though his time in L.A. marked Wilt\u2019s rebounding average dipping below 20 for the first time in his now-10-year-career, the team thrived and peaked in 1971-72, winning a still-standing record 33 consecutive games en route to winning The Finals against the Knicks. Chamberlain\u2019s monolithic No. 13 hovers over each of his former teams\u2019 current homes, an unmatched symbol of sheer physicality and production.  Number retired by: Trail Blazers (No. 22), Rockets (No. 22) As memories of Portland\u2019s lone 1977 championship became cluttered by more recent playoff shortcomings, the 14th overall pick of the 1983 Draft tiptoed his way into a new Blazers era. After averaging just 7.7 ppg as a rookie, \u201cClyde the Glide\u201d and his new team proved they were around to stay. Drexler made eight All-Star teams in Portland while leading the franchise to Finals appearances in 1990 and \u201992, an era defined by his greatness and the team\u2019s toughness. When that period began to fade, Drexler was traded in the middle of the 1994-95 season to defending-champion Houston, where he immediately meshed with reigning MVP Hakeem Olajuwon. Freed by the constant defensive attention drawn by \u201cThe Dream\u201d, Drexler\u2019s efficiency and Houston\u2019s repeat chances skyrocketed immediately. A few months later, Drexler was hoisting the championship trophy that had so long eluded him.  Number retired by: Nets (No. 32), 76ers (No. 6) The legend of \u201cDr. J\u201d resonates not just across teams, but leagues as well. Erving was more myth than man in the less visible ABA of the 1970s, where he redefined the game\u2019s aerial possibilities. He served as the quintessential superstar for both the league and the New York Nets, which won two championships with Erving leading the way. \u201cThe Doctor\u201d also won three straight ABA MVPs (1973-76) before the league merged with the NBA in \u201976. Erving\u2019s new home, Philadelphia, seemed tailor-made for his showmanship \u2014 and starving for its first title since the Chamberlain era. \u201cThe Doctor\u201d didn\u2019t disappoint, turning the 76ers into an instant contender before breaking through with the 1983 NBA championship.  Number retired by: Pistons (No. 16), Bucks (No. 16) Detroit\u2019s 1970s NBA identity revolved around Dave Bing and Lanier, a 6-foot-11 lefty that more than held his own with some of that decade\u2019s giants. Mobile and fundamental, Lanier tortured opponents with a sweeping hook from either hand and a quick second jump on the offensive glass. And though his Pistons teams never enjoyed a major playoff breakthrough, his individual success (seven All-Star appearances) and longevity in Detroit ensured his place \u2014 and No. 16 \u2014 among the franchise\u2019s all-time greats. Lanier was traded to Milwaukee in the middle of the 1979-80 season. He enjoyed one more All-Star honor with the Bucks, with whom he experienced his first ever conference finals in 1984. That wound up being his final season in the NBA, but Milwaukee didn\u2019t let the calendar year flip before raising his No. 16 to the rafters.   Number retired by: Hawks (No. 44), Jazz (No. 7), Pelicans (No. 7) One of the most gifted ball-handlers of all time, \u201cPistol Pete\u201d began his NBA career in Atlanta. In his four years with the Hawks, Maravich was twice named an All-Star and averaged 23 ppg or better in three of those seasons. A trade to the then-New Orleans Jazz in 1974 saw Maravich earn three more All-Star nods, as well as All-NBA honors and a scoring title. While his playoff success never matched his talent (he played in 26 career postseason games), Maravich remains an icon for basketball fans who remember or want to see the endless possibilities of a basketball in hand. His instinctual talent for misdirection and improvisation saw his No. 44 retired in Atlanta and his No. 7 with the Jazz. The New Orleans Pelicans franchise, though technically not the team for which Maravich played, also immortalized his No. 7.  Number retired by: Rockets (No. 24), 76ers (No. 2) Too often, Malone\u2019s name goes unmentioned in conversations of all-time great big men. Fans in Houston and Philadelphia know better. The Rockets enjoyed Malone\u2019s rebounding talent for six seasons, a stretch that saw Malone win two MVP awards and the team make its first trips to the conference finals and Finals. Malone was traded to Philadelphia in 1982, joining a 76ers team fresh off a Finals defeat to Abdul-Jabbar and the Lakers. With Malone aboard, Philly tore through the competition and prompted their new MVP center to predict a \u201cfo, fo, fo\u201d sweep of the playoffs. He was only one loss off, as the 76ers blasted their foes \u2014 including the Lakers in The Finals \u2014 en route to the 1983 title.  Number retired by: Wizards (No. 10), Knicks (No. 15) In a league dominated by big men, \u201cEarl the Pearl\u201d proved that the small could indeed topple the tall. The 6-foot-3 guard dazzled his way to the rim in four seasons with Baltimore, where he won Rookie of the Year honors and a pair of All-Star appearances. Monroe led the team in scoring in 1970-71, a season highlighted by the then-Bullets\u2019 first trip to The Finals. A trade to New York saw Monroe team up with Walt Frazier to form the \u201cRolls Royce Backcourt.\u201d The dynamic guard duo led the Knicks to their second title in four season, culminating in a five-game Finals coronation over the star-studded Lakers. \u201cThe Pearl\u201d earned another pair of All-Star appearances before retiring with the Knicks in 1980.  Number retired by: Nuggets (No. 55), Hawks (No. 55) The finger wag is universal now, but it was what came just before it that terrified would-be interior scorers for 18 years. \u201cMt. Mutombo\u201d led the league in blocks per game from 1993-96), all in his formative years with the Denver Nuggets. His time there is well documented (three All-Star appearances and a Defensive Player of the Year award) and is fondly remembered as the Nuggets became the first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in the first round of the playoffs. Mutombo\u2019s defensive dominance continued in Atlanta, where he earned another three DPOY trophies (he was traded to Philadelphia in the midst of his final award-winning season with the Hawks). He also helped the Hawks to their first back-to-back 50-win seasons since the Dominique Wilkins era.   Number retired by: Lakers (No. 34), Heat (No. 32) O\u2019Neal\u2019s dominance as a player was matched only by his personality as a person, qualities that meshed with the Los Angeles Lakers perfectly. \u201cThe Big Diesel\u2019s\u201d arrival jump-started a new era of NBA basketball in L.A., a new brand of \u201cShowtime\u201d that had an enormous star attraction in the middle. O\u2019Neal realized his full potential with the Lakers, running away with the 1999-2000 MVP award and decimating the rest of the league in route to a trio of NBA titles with a young Kobe Bryant as his running mate. A parting of ways saw O\u2019Neal traded to Miami in 2004, where he quickly set about proving he was still a championship-deciding superstar. Alongside another young star guard in Dwyane Wade, O\u2019Neal helped the Heat claim its first championship in 2006.  Number retired by: Kings (No. 14), Bucks (No. 1) Robertson\u2019s early days are harder to visualize not because of the player, but the team. The Cincinnati Royals are now the Sacramento Kings, but the team\u2019s former city and name remain synonymous with the NBA\u2019s original walking triple-double. Robertson averaged an absurd 29.3 ppg, 10.3 apg and 8.5 rpg in 10 seasons with the Royals, including his iconic triple-double average as a 23-year-old player in his second season. He was an All-Star from 1960-70 in Cincinnati while claiming six assist crowns, a scoring title, Rookie of the Year (1960-61) and MVP honors (1963-64), too. In terms of competitiveness, many of his peers describe him as \u201cJordan before Jordan.\u201d The Royals came within one game of toppling the mighty Celtics in the 1963 Eastern Division finals. A stunning trade to Milwaukee in 1970 paired Robertson with the ultimate frontcourt teammate in Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The pair quickly gelled and led the Bucks to 66 wins in its first season together before rolling through the playoffs and sweeping Baltimore in The Finals. Robertson and Abdul-Jabbar made the Finals again in 1974 before ultimately falling to the Celtics.  Number retired by: Warriors (No. 42), Cavaliers (No. 42) The oft-forgotten third pillar of rebounding during the Russell-Chamberlain era, Thurmond averaged 15 rpg over his entire Hall-of-Fame career. The \u201cChairman of the Boards\u201d spent his first 11 seasons with the Warriors, amassing seven All-Star appearances and five All-Defensive honors. Thurmond played for two Finals teams in San Francisco, the latter coming closest in a 4-2 loss to Chamberlain\u2019s 76ers in 1967. Thurmond spent the last two years of his career in his home state of Ohio, playing a key role in Cleveland\u2019s first conference finals team in 1976."},{"id":452446,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/what-to-expect-when-the-ball-goes-up-on-this-brand-new-nba-season","date":"2020-12-21","title":"What to expect when the ball goes up on this brand-new NBA season","content":"Keeping it professional and clean, here\u2019s the sanitized version of LeBron James\u2019 reaction to the new NBA season beginning just 73 days after the old one ended: \u201cOh, (blank)!\u201d Well, that\u2019s one way to forecast the 2020-21 season, which starts Tuesday night, ends in July, runs 72 games, and because of a global pandemic will be played out on television, but inside near-empty arenas.

Giannis Antetokounmpo will have (blank) regrets about signing that massive extension with the Bucks. Right away? Zero regrets. First of all, how many humans, no matter their wealth, get buyer\u2019s remorse about becoming $228 million richer? Also, the Bucks are still in the upper class and with the exception of Brooklyn, nobody in the East upgraded substantially. Speaking of that, everyone is giddy over Milwaukee adding Jrue Holiday. Obviously, he will help at both ends. But here are the facts: Holiday has only made one All-Star team, one first team All-Defense, never All-NBA and helped his team to only two playoff appearances since 2012. Also, because the Bucks surrendered a ton to trade for him, they\u2019ll be forced to pay him massively next summer when he becomes a free agent at age 31, therefore restricting how much they can improve the roster afterward. That\u2019s when Giannis might have regrets. Russell Westbrook will do (blank) this season for his third team in three years. How about \u201cjust enough?\u201d Westbrook still brings the heat three years after winning the Kia MVP and should flirt with triple-doubles when his game is right. What he shouldn\u2019t do is conflict with Bradley Beal, who isn\u2019t a high-usage player, and who\u2019ll get more clean looks with Westbrook attacking the glass and breaking down defenses and kicking the ball out. But Westbrook\u2019s own shooting efficiency is dying quickly and, in a tight game, the Wizards will suffer if he\u2019s left open with the ball beyond 15 feet. James Harden will be with the (blank) when the season tips. Rockets, most likely, because his situation is complicated. Any team that trades for the unhappy scoring savant must virtually overhaul its entire system \u2026 unless Harden goes to a team where he isn\u2019t the first option. Meaning, a team with a better player. That eliminates roughly 26 other teams immediately. The most logical destination is Brooklyn because Harden will be No. 2 to Kevin Durant, and the Nets can send Houston a better package than the Rockets will get anywhere else. The surprise team will be (blank). Look, the teams projected to be bad will be bad; there are no Cinderellas in the making. Therefore, who\u2019ll be this year\u2019s Miami Heat, the good team that goes next level? The choice here is the Portland Trail Blazers, who had a busy offseason by re-signing Carmelo Anthony, adding Derrick Jones Jr., Robert Covington, and Enes Kanter, got a healthy Zach Collins back, and boast a candidate for Kia Most Improved Player in Gary Trent Jr. As we saw in the bubble, their thirsty superstar, Damian Lillard, is restless and ready. Portland is the dark horse 2021 NBA contender. The surprise player will be (blank). Deandre Ayton comes into this season dealing with a pair of demons from the past: His banned substance suspension last season which possibly cost the Suns a playoff spot, and the stigma of being drafted ahead of Luka Doncic. However, he also goes into this season prepared to catch lobs from Chris Paul. That will make him a bigger option offensively. If Paul can coax him into making better decisions and being more aggressive in the post, Ayton will move up the big man ladder, maybe skipping a few steps. The players itching for an injury comeback besides Wall and Durant are (blank). Bojan Bogdanovic, because the Jazz missed his shooting; Victor Oladipo, because the Pacers are still wondering what\u2019s up; Marvin Bagley III, because the Kings drafted him ahead of Luka Doncic; Otto Porter Jr., because the Bulls are desperate; and Will Barton, because the Nuggets lost Jerami Grant. After Anthony Davis, (blank) will be LeBron\u2019s best teammate. Dennis Schroder needs the ball, and ordinarily that would be an issue for a LeBron teammate. But maybe this is what LeBron needs at this stage, someone to relieve him of that chore, especially in a regular season where LeBron probably will and should get lots of rest given the abbreviated 2020 offseason. Schroder gets to the rim as good as anyone and his shooting and decision making have improved. The coach-player relationship to watch is (blank) and (blank). Stan Van Gundy and Zion Williamson might be catching each other at the right time. For Van Gundy, the Pelicans\u2019 job is a professional life preserver after a below-expectations stint in Detroit and a fallout in Orlando. Van Gundy is wiser from both, and after a tremendous stint doing TV work, is ready for the bench again. This is Williamson\u2019s second coach and he doesn\u2019t want to travel the same path as Devin Booker, who has averaged one coach for every season of his career. Williamson should enjoy freedom under Van Gundy and hopefully will be unleashed to display the ballistic talent that he is. Expect something around 25 points, eight rebounds and plenty of dunk highlights nightly. The hard truth is, the (blank) are going nowhere fast. In the last four years, LeBron and Durant passed on the chance to sign with the New York Knicks. That tells you how far this franchise has fallen. There\u2019s no superstar in residence, and the young players all have limitations and flaws. A sketchy Draft history, an inability to attract A-list free agents and an unproven player development system put the Knicks, who\u2019ve missed the playoffs seven straight seasons, in basketball purgatory. Yes, there is new leadership, and a proven coach in Tom Thibodeau, but a return to the Draft lottery is inevitable \u2014 and necessary. The coaching seat will be hottest for (blank) . It\u2019ll be a surprise if any coaching changes are made next summer; most jobs appear to be safe, barring a complete collapse. But there\u2019s rising expectations in Atlanta, where the Hawks spent heavily to upgrade a roster they believe is good enough to make the playoffs. Plus, the Hawks were among the worst defensive teams last season, and that needs to change. Which means, Lloyd Pierce has his hands full. The Spurs\u2019 one-year streak of missing the playoffs will (blank). Sadly for San Antonio, it\u2019s likely to continue. The Spurs are undergoing a generational talent shift, where LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan and Rudy Gay are slowly giving way to 24-and-unders Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker and rookie Devin Vassell. Meanwhile, the competition in the West, once again, is too vicious for a team without a superstar. The real question is when does the generational shift begin on the bench? After this season, does cpach Gregg Popovich, who turns 72 next month, give way to Becky Hammon? Among the players who could be traded by the March 25 deadline is (blank). Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, PJ Tucker, LaMarcus Aldridge and Terry Rozier. And here are the reasons, in order: Increasingly bad fit in Indy, not the star Orlando thought it had, wants more money, no future with the Spurs, LaMelo Ball and Devonte\u2019 Graham. The best off-season additions will be (blank) in terms of value: Bobby Portis, an active and aggressive player, will be a bang for the Bucks at $7 million for two years \u2026 The Raptors got Aron Baynes to replace a prehistoric Marc Gasol for two years at $14 million (the second year a team option) \u2026 Serge Ibaka cost the Clippers two years and $19 million for a starting center who spaces the floor and defends \u2026 Montrezl Harrell\u2019s poor play in the bubble allowed the Lakers to get the Sixth Man Award winner on marked down discount at two years and $19 million. The worst off-season additions will be (blank) in terms of value: The Pistons are paying $85 million for three years of Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the entire list. If Giannis is the best player in the East, (blank) is second best. Roughly two years ago, just before Giannis started his Kia MVP streak, Kevin Durant was perhaps the best player in the league. Anyway, KD seems poised to rise again after recovering from a torn Achilles. His game relies more on outside shooting instead of explosive athleticism, which means his injury shouldn\u2019t linger. A Nets-Bucks showdown in the East finals would also be a superstar showdown. Speaking of showdown, the new blood rivalry in the East is (blank) vs. (blank). Brooklyn vs. Boston if only because of Kyrie. Sadly, the fans won\u2019t be in on the show at TD Garden this season. The new blood rivalry in the West is (blank) vs. (blank). Clippers vs. Trail Blazers. After being mocked by Paul George and hearing cackling from Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris in the bubble, you best believe Damian Lillard knows what time it is. The Kia Rookie of the Year race will be decided by (blank). They\u2019ve played so little basketball since March, so we won\u2019t know about the rookies right away. But: Issac Okoro will get plenty of touches on an average Cavs team. That\u2019s the usual recipe for this award. Beware of Deni Avdija of the Wizards, maybe James Wiseman of the Warriors and, if he can shoot 40 percent, LaMelo Ball of the Hornets. The Kia MVP race will be decided by (blank) . Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid and Damian Lillard, with Luka winning a close contest by doing heavy lifting for the Mavericks until Kristaps Porzingis returns. The (blank) will be the playoff eight in the East. Bucks, Nets, Celtics, Sixers, Heat, Raptors, Hawks, Wizards. Pacers lose the play-in. The (blank) will be the playoff eight in the West. Lakers, Blazers, Nuggets, Clippers, Jazz, Warriors, Pelicans, Mavericks. Suns lose the play-in. And the next champion will be (blank). You\u2019ll just have to wait until our playoff preview next spring. We\u2019re not filling all the blanks right now. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The deal is a three-year, $40 million extension, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. \u201cIt is especially gratifying for our Lakers franchise to draft, develop and now sign one of our own to a contract extension,\u201d Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka said in a statement released by the team. \u201cKyle has shown tremendous growth over the last three years, and played a crucial role on last season\u2019s championship team. Kyle has been a terrific member of the Lakers community and we are all very excited about his continued future with us.\u201d Kuzma averaged 12.8 points and 4.5 rebounds per game in 61 games last season and was a key part of the Lakers\u2019 run to the 2020 championship, averaging 10.0 points in 21 games in the Orlando bubble. He made the All-NBA rookie first team in 2018, and the smooth scorer averaged a career-best 18.7 points in his second pro season after the arrival of LeBron James. On his career, the 27th pick of the 2017 Draft has averaged 16.0 points while shooting 44.9% overall and 33.1% on 3-pointers. When Anthony Davis and several veteran additions transformed the Lakers into title contenders last season, Kuzma transitioned into a supporting role as a reserve scorer and a wing defender. His scoring average and shooting percentage declined, but he worked on improving his defense and playmaking. Despite his decline in numbers, Kuzma is a valuable component for the defending champs because of his versatility and capability of providing quick offense. James and Davis have mentored Kuzma on defense as well, and Kuzma is expected to compete for a starting job and more minutes this season. The Lakers begin defense of their 16th NBA championship on Tuesday night against the LA Clippers. The champs will be pressed hard against the salary cap for the foreseeable future, so their ability to re-sign their own players is crucial. Kuzma also has significant value as a potential trade component at this salary if the Lakers and Kuzma decide to break up in the future. The Lakers locked down a significant portion of their core during the short offseason after their triumph in the Florida bubble. Davis and James agreed to lucrative deals that will keep them together for three more seasons, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope got a three-year deal worth more than $39 million. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":452267,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/top-15-players-under-age-25","date":"2020-12-20","title":"The future is bright: Top 15 players 25 or younger","content":"Age is nothing but a number in the NBA. Just ask LeBron James, who looks as spry as ever as he embarks upon Year 18 just days before his 36th birthday as the league standard. We all know that LeBron is the exception to the rule, and that Father Time, if not necessarily undefeated, wins far more than he ever comes close to losing. That\u2019s why it makes sense to appreciate the longevity of the league\u2019s aging superstars while simultaneously keeping the focus on the next generation, those up and coming superstars poised to take control of the league in the near future. With the start of the 2020-21 season just days away, it\u2019s time to shine the light on the next wave of superstars, all 25 or younger. (Note: Players below are listed by age, so feel free to argue amongst yourselves about the pecking order) Age: 25 2019-20 Season Stats: 19.9 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 7.0 apg The buzz on Jokic: If there was an All-Orlando playoff bubble team, Jokic would have been the first team center. (There was an All-Bubble first and second team for the eight seeding games that Jokic didn\u2019t make.) The Nuggets\u2019 big man has established himself as the most effective center in the league. Whatever he lacks in explosive athleticism he more than makes up for everywhere else. Jokic scores from anywhere on the floor and he\u2019s a great passer and excellent rebounder. The Nuggets have built their entire roster around the versatile Joker, who should play his way into the Kia MVP conversation this season. The continued development of the pieces around him (Michael Porter Jr. and Bol Bol come to mind) will determine just how impactful a player Jokic becomes long-term, if he\u2019s the sort of player a championship team can be crafted around. Age: 25 2019-20 Season Stats: 26.5 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 4.4 apg The buzz on Towns: Towns is playing with a heavy heart this season, having lost his mother to COVID-19 in April. Executives around the league have praised Towns as the most talented young big man in the league since his rookie season \u2026 and for good reason. His skill set and ability to operate at a high level on both ends of the floor puts him in that elite category of two-way stars, regardless of age. The Timberwolves have bet the franchise on building a consistent winner on the leadership, work ethic and talent of Towns and his good friend and point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell. (Minnesota also has the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 draft, Anthony Edwards, in the fold now as well.) Towns is aging out of the list, so the expectations for him will change dramatically in the next few seasons. But this campaign serves as a critical one in his career, if only because it comes with a sense of purpose and an air of redemption for one of the league\u2019s best pure talents. Age: 24 2019-20 Season Stats: 16.4 ppg, 8.0 apg, 7.8 rpg The buzz on Simmons: Simmons has inspired spirited debates from the moment he entered the league. Some love his versatility and defensive prowess and consider him a jumbo point guard with transcendent talent. Others lament his lack of 3-point shooting and seemingly indifferent attitude about improving that aspect of his game. What can\u2019t be disputed is the fact that he\u2019s developing into one of the NBA\u2019s premier defensive players. And now we\u2019ll get to see what coach Doc Rivers can do to unlock the rest of his game. The legion of believers in Simmons insist we haven\u2019t seen the best of what he brings, which makes sense when you consider how much work he has to do on his offensive game. It\u2019s fair, though, to wonder if Simmons will get the chance to continue his development in Philadelphia or somewhere else (there\u2019s no sense in acting like those James Harden trade rumors don\u2019t exist). Age: 24 2019-20 Season Stats: 24.0 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 4.3 apg The buzz on Mitchell: The Jazz didn\u2019t hesitate to lock Mitchell up with a max extension, not after the way he\u2019s put on for the franchise. His playoff performance in the Orlando bubble (he and Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray put on a show for the ages ) showed off all facets of his game. He shot a blistering 52% on 3-pointers, averaging 36.3 ppg all while elevating his game in the most competitive environment possible. He\u2019s blossomed into a legitimate superstar scorer and the face of the franchise for the foreseeable future, which is great news for new Jazz owner Ryan Smith. What the Jazz put around him long-term remains a bit of a mystery. Rudy Gobert has been stellar, a three-time All-NBA pick and two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year to date. But the question lingers, can Mitchell play at the highest level with another superstar wing\/perimeter player? That\u2019s probably the only way the Jazz climb into that upper echelon in the West on a consistent basis. Age: 24 2019-20 Season Stats: 26.6 ppg, 6.5 apg, 4.2 rpg The buzz on Booker: Another young star who lit up the Orlando bubble with his play, Booker had to settle for the eight seeding games the Suns played in the restart. He led them to eight straight wins to finish their season, one of three players (along with Damian Lillard and Luka Doncic) to earn unanimous All-Bubble first-team honors , showing off a polish to his game that suggests he\u2019s much more than just an elite shooter\/scorer. The addition of Chris Paul will add a few new wrinkles to Booker\u2019s game and the Suns\u2019 attack as defenses must pick their poison against one of the NBA\u2019s best backcourts. It should be noted, however, that with or without the addition of CP3, Booker\u2019s star was on an upward trajectory heading into 2020-21. He showed enough in those eight seeding games to make that clear. Age: 24 2019-20 Season Stats: 20.3 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.1 apg The buzz on Brown: Brown\u2019s evolution as one of the NBA\u2019s best two-way players was on display in Boston\u2019s run to the 2020 Eastern Conference finals. Brown posted career highs in his fourth season and cemented his status as one of the staples of Boston\u2019s new-era Big 3 along with All-Stars Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker. Brown can score 20 points a night and take on the responsibility of locking down the opposition\u2019s best perimeter player. Brown\u2019s value as a leader for the Celtics and throughout the league might be of even greater value. He\u2019s one of the brightest and most conscientious athletes you\u2019ll find. If there\u2019s a player in this group most likely to one day be head of the NBA Players\u2019 Association, it\u2019s Brown. Age: 23 2019-20 Season Stats: 15.9 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 5.1 apg The buzz on Adebayo: The Heat\u2019s do-it-all forward\/center proved his worth with standout performances during an All-Star season and then punctuated it with a stellar 2020 playoffs. He had one of the signature plays from the playoffs ( see his rim rejection of a Jayson Tatum dunk ) and cemented his status as one of the best big men in the league with his effort in Orlando. The Heat wouldn\u2019t have made The Finals without Aedebayo\u2019s emergence as both an offensive conduit and defensive backbone in his first full season as a starter. The scary part for the rest of the league is he\u2019s still improving and hasn\u2019t fully filled out his frame. Adebayo is in a program that won\u2019t allow him to rest on what he\u2019s done, not with Heat culture experts like Udonis Haslem in the locker room and new assistant coach Caron Butler on the bench. Age: 23 2019-20 Season Stats: 18.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 4.8 bpg The buzz on Murray: No single player saw his stock rise based on his play in the Orlando bubble more than Murray, who was battling back from injury when the restart kicked off. If playoff Murray (26.5 ppg, 45% on 3-pointers) shows up during the regular season, he\u2019ll push for space in a crowded field for All-Star honors in the Western Conference. Murray was that good in the playoffs, where he shredded the Jazz and Clippers in back-to-back comebacks from 3-1 series deficits. He gave the Lakers all they could handle in the Western Conference finals, earning the highest praise from LeBron James when it was all over. His college coach, John Calipari, warned that Murray was being underestimated in the lead up to the 2016 draft. Calipari was spot on there about Murray \u2026 and several other ex-Wildcats on this list. Age: 23 2017-18 Season Stats: 23.8 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 4.2 apg The buzz on Ingram: While Zion Williamson garnered most of the buzz last season, it was the lanky and lethal Ingram who was the Pelicans\u2019 best player. The winner of the Kia Most Improved Player award for his efforts, Ingram shouldered the nightly go-to guy burden on a team that harbored playoff aspirations from the start of the season through the seeding games in the restart. The Pelicans came up short, of course, but not because Ingram wasn\u2019t up to the task. Those Kevin Durant comparisons that seemed a bit far-fetched early in his career don\u2019t seem so out of line now. The All-Star could, in the next few seasons, form a potentially dynamic duo with Williamson. Either way, Ingram has established himself as as a legitimate star with All-NBA potential on his own. Age: 22 2017-18 Season Stats: 29.3 ppg, 9.3 apg, 4.3 rpg The buzz on Young: HIs critics will suggest that Young\u2019s spectacular numbers have been empty calories, given the Hawks\u2019 brutal 49-100 record in his two seasons. Those critics clearly don\u2019t appreciate the offensive brilliance that is obvious to the rest of the world. Young joined Luka Doncic as an All-Star starter in his sophomore season for a reason. He\u2019s the face of the franchise in Atlanta for good reason. There\u2019s no mistake here, Young is already an elite scorer and playmaker just two seasons into his career. A stellar offseason and free-agent haul has the Hawks talking playoffs, which is the single biggest motivator for Young, who says the narrative that he can\u2019t win is a myth he\u2019s eager to put to rest. This season holds huge ramifications for Young\u2019s viability as the catalyst of an elite, playoff outfit. Age: 22 2017-18 Season Stats: 23.4 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 3.0 apg The buzz on Tatum: Tatum would be an easy No. 1 pick if we could get a do-over on the 2017 Draft. Danny Ainge got it right in selecting the versatile Tatum, who fully stepped into his own as an All-Star last season. While most players his age are just now figuring out who and what they are in the league, Tatum is already a seasoned veteran, complete with 45 playoff games and two trips to the Eastern Conference finals. The growth and development he\u2019s put on full display guaranteed his status for the 5-year, $195 million max contract extension he signed last month. The Celtics have long-term keepers in both Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who have a chance to be the best forward duo in the league before they are done in Boston. And that\u2019s before we see what Tatum\u2019s ceiling really is, which includes the potential to be in the Kia MVP mix one day. Age: 22 2017-18 Season Stats: 21.1 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 6.8 apg The buzz on Fox: He doesn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as some of his peers. Yet Fox is probably the best young player in the game that no one talks about when the discussion turns to the top players at his position. The Kings know what they are working with, though, having rewarded Fox\u2019s early efforts with a 5-year, $163 million contract extension last month. That\u2019s perhaps the best indicator of a young player\u2019s market value. The Kings are banking on Fox\u2019s considerable talent; he\u2019s the fastest player with the ball in his hands and already a 20-point scorer without the aid of a reliable 3-point shot. Fox still has so much room to improve that it\u2019s hard to forecast where he might fit in the pecking order in a couple of seasons. There\u2019s so much to work with here, if the Kings are truly committed to the blueprint of building around Fox. Age: 21 2017-18 Season Stats: 17.8 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 7.3 apg The buzz on Morant: The Grizzlies might not have realized it at the time, but the 2019 draft lottery yielded two future superstars in Williamson and Morant, who was a runaway winner in the 2020 Kia Rookie of the Year race. Morant\u2019s fearlessness, creativity as a scorer and facilitator and next-level athleticism set him apart from the crowd. He makes the spectacular look routine, no matter who is on the court with him. He gives the Grizzlies star power on the court and provided an immediate face of the franchise off it. It\u2019ll be easier to sell free agents on a bright future in Memphis with a talent like Morant already in place and ready to ascend. You simply don\u2019t find players with his scintillating combination of skill and style on a regular basis. And that\u2019s a mouthful in a league filled with next-level physical specimens. The more proficient he becomes as a shooter, the deadlier his game will be in the future. Age: 21 2017-18 Season Stats: 28.8 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 8.8 apg The buzz on Doncic: A strong case can be made for Luka as the very best of this under-25 group of stars. He\u2019s the only one who has finished in the top five of the Kia MVP balloting. The pilot of the most efficient offense in league history last season, his coming-out party extended to the first round of the playoffs. In Orlando, he both earned unanimous All-Bubble first team honors and staked his claim to the throne by destroying the LA Clippers\u2019 attempts to slow him down. What he did to elite defenders Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in that series was just more of what he unleashed on the entire league. A jumbo point guard with every part of his offensive game already at an elite level, it\u2019s up to Doncic (and continued good health) to determine where he ultimately lands on the league\u2019s list of the best of the very best. He\u2019s already top five just two years in. The next decade \u2026 it\u2019s all on the table. Age: 20 2017-18 Season Stats: 22.5 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 2.1 apg The buzz on Williamson: Judging strictly on the smile he\u2019s walking around with during this preseason, it\u2019s obvious that Zion is loving every bit of being freed up to play big minutes after his injury-related limitations of 2019-20. The reason he\u2019s considered a generational talent has been on full display early on with coach Stan Van Gundy at the helm in the New Orleans. For those who remember that Van Gundy got the best out of a transcendent young big man in Dwight Howard during his Orlando days, this is a welcome sight. Zion\u2019s unique combination of size and skill make him one of the most intriguing physical beings to hit an NBA floor. To be as impactful as he\u2019s been in such a limited amount of time on the court is nothing short of staggering, particularly for a player who\u2019s still clearly so early in his development. And the immense star power he generates now will only increase as he continues to round out his game. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see who, between he and Doncic or perhaps someone else, captures the title as the global face of the game over the course of the next decade.

Those days are long forgotten. Gobert has signed a contract extension with the Jazz, the team said Sunday without divulging terms. A person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press that the deal is worth $205 million over five years, though Gobert holds an option to end the deal one year early. \u201cRudy\u2019s competitiveness and will to win have been instrumental in watching how he has grown and evolved into an elite player in our league,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cHe is dedicated to his teammates and to winning here in Utah.\u201d The move, first reported by ESPN , was announced two days after Ryan Smith was confirmed by the NBA\u2019s board of governors to become the owner of the Jazz, and is the capper to an offseason where Utah committed perhaps as much as $400 million to Gobert and Donovan Mitchell over the five seasons that span from 2021-22 through 2025-26. The Jazz signed Mitchell to an extension last month that could reach $195 million over those five years. \u201cI\u2019m here to stay, and I\u2019m here to WIN a championship,\u201d Gobert wrote in a letter \u2014 he addressed it \u201cDear Utah\u201d \u2014 posted to Twitter on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m here to win with my brothers, I\u2019m here to win with Coach Q and I\u2019m here to win with you, Utah. Let\u2019s get it. Merci.\u201d Gobert is a three-time All-Defensive team player, a two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and made the All-Star team last season for the first time. The 7-foot-1 native of France \u2014 with a 7-foot-9 wingspan \u2014 has blocked 989 shots in the last six seasons, more than anyone else in the NBA during that stretch. He averaged 15.1 points and a career-best 13.5 rebounds last season and led the NBA in dunks. \u201cThe impact he\u2019s had on our team, the state of Utah and so many other communities around the world is immeasurable,\u201d Jazz executive vice president of basketball operations Dennis Lindsey said. Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive for the coronavirus, getting that result back on March 11 \u2014 the test that prompted the NBA to suspend its season that very night and stop games for 4 1\/2 months. Two days before that test result, before leaving a media session at a pregame shootaround, Gobert touched all the reporters\u2019 tape recorders that were placed before him on a table in an attempt to be funny \u2014 and, after it was learned that Mitchell also tested positive, exposed Gobert to criticism that he was not taking the virus seriously. Gobert donated more than $500,000 to funds established to help those who work part-time at Jazz games and families affected by the pandemic. He also taped a public-service announcement for the league and, in time, apparently healed his relationship with Mitchell as well. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to control everyone\u2019s perception of me, but I can control my actions,\u201d Gobert said this past summer. \u201cI can control, you know, the things I do for the people around me, for the community, the things I do for my teammates on the court, off the court. All that stuff, I can control and that\u2019s what really matters to me.\u201d"},{"id":452121,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sunday-scqool-presents-nba-opening-week","date":"2020-12-20","title":"Sunday Scqool presents NBA Opening Week","content":"Get ready for the NBA season in style with a special edition of Sunday Scqool with DJ D-Nice and DJ Clark Kent.

The 43-year-old known as \u201cHalf Man, Half Amazing\u201d had spent more than half of his life as a professional basketball player. While Carter was fortunate enough to play for more than two decades, most NBA careers are much shorter, with an average hovering around five-to-seven years, which means more \u201clife after basketball\u201d to prepare for than basketball to be played. For Carter, he took the media route, signing a multi-year contract with ESPN to serve as an NBA and college basketball analyst. Another path that former players might consider is pursuing coaching opportunities, whether they be at the high school, collegiate or professional level, to share their knowledge of the game with the next generation of players. To assist former players who are looking to transition into the coaching ranks, the NBA launched the Assistant Coaches Program in 1988. The goal of the program is to develop qualified coaching candidates by providing current and retired NBA, G League and WNBA players with hands-on-coaching experiences, scouting software training, professional development and event-based networking opportunities. Candidates also have the opportunity to receive guidance and learn from program mentor and former NBA head coach Butch Carter, who\u2019s been a part of the program since 2016. Since its inception, the program has exposed nearly 200 candidates to NBA and G League general managers, coaches and team personnel through on-court experiences. Notable ACP alums include current Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams, former G League Coach of the Year (2017) and current Vanderbilt University head coach Jerry Stackhouse and assistant coach for the University of Maine men\u2019s basketball team Edniesha Curry. Five coaching candidates from the 2019 program alone were members of 2019-20 NBA and G League coaching staffs and this year\u2019s seven-member class is looking to continue that trend, including NBA veterans Mike Bibby and Chris Duhon as well as D-League alum Ronald Allen. All three former players had coaching experience before joining the Assistant Coaches Program in late 2019, but took their knowledge of the craft to new heights thanks to participation in the coaching boot camp. \u201cI think this is a program that\u2019s very beneficial for former players to really understand what it takes to be a coach and what coaches go through on a night-in, night-out basis,\u201d Duhon said. \u201cThe preparation for both practices and games, your responsibilities as an assistant coach, learning different parts of the game that as a player you may not understand as much, and it just gives you an opportunity to be able to do multiple things. \u201cUsually former players get into coaching, the only thing that they do is player development. We learned how to do that, but we also learned the technology skills of coaching, putting together presentations, being able to speak in front of a group, how to do scouting reports and many more things.\u201d The Assistant Coaches Program looks to give its candidates all of the tools that will be needed to become a successful coach at the professional level. This includes extensive technical training in scouting and video editing software, analytics and technologies with access to Synergy, Fast Draw, Fast Scout, SportsCode and JustPlay basketball-learning software. Through mentor Butch Carter\u2019s Analytics 4 Coaches program, candidates are able to learn the various software platforms and how to pair their knowledge of the game as players with analytics to improve their overall coaching profile. NBA players are used to reading scouting reports as they prepare to take on an opponent. However, most do not understand the tools used to develop that report and the amount of time and effort it takes to put it together. The ACP gives its candidates a deep understanding of basketball analytics, player evaluations and the ability to develop detailed scouting reports. Allen was not only a member of the 2019-20 ACP class, he also participated back in 2014 alongside Stackhouse. Allen would go on to work with young players and helped prepare some future NBA players during their pre-draft workouts. He eventually took an opportunity to become the head coach at Inglewood High School but decided to return to the program to help take the next steps in his career trajectory. \u201cThe second time around, what drove me to the program was I had several interviews to be an assistant coach on multiple G League staffs, and I continued to run into roadblocks, whether it was, I didn\u2019t have enough head coaching experience, I didn\u2019t have enough coaching experience altogether, or I didn\u2019t have the ability to operate and navigate with the software and technology,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat was the last box that I needed to check to become a fully qualified candidate for an assistant coaching position at the G League level.\u201d When Allen learned that the technological and software skills he was missing were now being offered in the ACP, he asked if he could return to the program to continue his development and was welcomed back. The technical knowledge was the key focus for Bibby as well, who entered the program as a novice when it came to technology. He went from someone who \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell you how to do anything on a computer\u201d to breaking down video, cutting highlights together and developing scouting reports for the players that he trains. \u201cIt helped me out tremendously because back in the day, if you were an NBA player then you had a good chance to be a coach just off of that. But now there are so many things that you need to know, especially when it comes to using computers and that\u2019s what I was missing.\u201d The 2019-20 program began in December 2019 with the first meeting being at the MGM Resorts NBA G League Winter Showcase in Las Vegas. The Showcase is the G League\u2019s annual in-season scouting event, when all the teams in the league travel to one city and play in front of NBA general managers and player personnel executives from all 30 NBA organizations. The Showcase ended up being the only in-person event of the 2019-20 program as the coronavirus pandemic forced the ACP to transition to a full virtual experience. But for Bibby, that one in-person event in Las Vegas led to a future opportunity and highlighted a key aspect of the program \u2013 networking. Bibby, who spent six-and-a-half seasons of his playing career with the Sacramento Kings, met Ty Ellis, the coach of the Kings\u2019 G League affiliate \u2013 the Stockton Kings \u2013 while in Las Vegas. After Ellis spoke to the larger group, Bibby asked Ellis if he would mind if Bibby sat in on some of Stockton\u2019s practices, games and meetings. Ellis obliged and Bibby took part in film sessions, workouts and meetings over a four-game span before the G League season was halted due to the pandemic. Now Ellis and Bibby and working together again to assist the NBA G League Ignite program. The team of top prospects coming out of high school is beginning to scrimmage together and Ellis and Bibby are coaching the free agent team that the Ignite squad is competing against. That initial meeting in Las Vegas launched a relationship that as Bibby puts it \u201chas opened a lot of doors for me already.\u201d This type of networking and collaboration with current and former NBA and G League coaches is core to the program to help the candidates grow. And while the pandemic halted the in-person interactions, it continued in a virtual setting with two calls per week with the program participants focused on coaching and development; homework assignments; and a guest speaker series of professionals from across the industry focused on professional development opportunities, and mock interviews with current and former professional and collegiate basketball decision-makers. \u201cWith us going virtual, we were able to get more guest speakers, with G League coaches or GMs, which is something that might not have been able to happen if the season was a normal season,\u201d said Duhon. \u201cSo for us to be able to pick their brains, network, and to be able to talk with them and them give us advice, I think that was very beneficial as well during this tough time.\u201d The program ultimately concluded in September with the candidates looking for future opportunities as hiring gets back into full swing. \u201cThe next step, definitely short term, is looking to be an assistant with a G League team,\u201d said Allen. \u201cAnd long term is working my way up into the next level, through the G League and through the NBA to put myself in a position to one day become a head coach.\u201d Whichever opportunities come next, all three candidates feel more prepared for them after being part of the 2019-20 ACP class. \u201cI recommend this program to anybody that\u2019s looking to coach, it helped me tremendously,\u201d said Bibby. \u201cThe Assistant Coaches Program is an investment in the potential of our former players. It builds on their invaluable insights and unique experience as pros while teaching them the technical skills demanded in the professional coaching space,\u201d said NBA Player Development Vice President Jamila Wideman. \u201cWe are thrilled about the success of this year\u2019s program, which is a true testament to the talent of the candidates and the ability to shift the robust curriculum virtually.\u201d"},{"id":451210,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wizards-thomas-bryant-fined-45k-for-inappropriate-contact-with-game-official","date":"2020-12-19","title":"Wizards' Thomas Bryant fined $45K for inappropriate contact with game official","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Washington Wizards center Thomas Bryant has been fined $45,000 for repeatedly making inappropriate contact with a game official, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies once again seem to be an afterthought heading into the NBA season. There isn\u2019t much buzz about last year\u2019s NBA Rookie of the Year. At least there\u2019s not the attention the retooled Lakers, Kevin Durant\u2019s return to the court or Zion Williamson\u2019s sophomore campaign are getting. Morant and this teammates were a surprise last season and he plans to remove any doubt this year. \u201cAttacking the season and proving everybody wrong is my number one goal,\u201d Morant said. Memphis\u2019 young star and Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins are in complete agreement on what Mortant needs to work on in his second season. \u201cEverything,\u201d Morant said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s that simple.\u201d Asked what he wants Morant to improve on, Jenkins said, \u201cMy simple answer would be everything.\u201d Grizzlies optimistic after last season\u2019s finish. Expectations are very high in Memphis thanks to the point guard\u2019s impressive rookie debut. Not only was Morant a nearly unanimous pick as NBA Rookie of the Year, he was the lone unanimous pick on the league\u2019s All-Rookie first team with teammate Brandon Clarke, one of the rising stars for All-Star Weekend in Chicago and a three-time pick as the Western Conference\u2019s rookie of the month. Morant led the Grizzlies with 17.8 points per game while starting 67 games. He also averaged 7.3 assists and 3.9 rebounds while shooting 47.7%. He had a pair of triple-doubles and 15 double-doubles. But Memphis lost the play-in game Aug. 15 to Portland after going 2-6 in the seeding games to miss the playoffs. Morant took that personally even if the Grizzlies didn\u2019t have Justice Winslow in the bubble and lost Jaren Jackson Jr. to a knee injury after three games. \u201cI felt like I could have been better in a lot of places,\u201d Morant said. \u201cObviously, I didn\u2019t get the job done. So that\u2019s a big takeaway.\u201d How can Memphis get back to the postseason? Jenkins believes Morant is motivated to improve every facet of his game, on and off the court. \u201cHow can he be a better decision maker, shooter, leader on the offensive end? How can he be the leader of our defensive unit? And being the first line of attack, how can he a better pick-and-roll defender, activity, rebounder to start our break,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s holistic. I think he embraces that challenge. That\u2019s how he\u2019s built.\u201d The head coach, going into his second season as well, said he talked with Morant a lot about being a leader, the need to work on his body with diet and nutrition. Since leaving the bubble, the 6-foot-2 guard has added another five pounds to his listed 175 pounds. Morant also has worked on his shot and said his percentages have been improving with each workout since last season ended. He shot nearly 48% from the floor as a rookie, but only 33.5% from 3-point range. The Grizzlies want Morant taking a few more 3s per game, though Jenkins made clear they are not trying to keep Morant away from a mid-range jumper. Memphis coaches want Morant catching and shooting more 3s after the guard was a 42% shooter in those situations rather than off the dribble, where he was in the low 30s. They also want Morant to read and react quicker when the guard either shoots a 3 or goes to the basket. \u201cHe\u2019s got an elite floater, and we want him to excel in that and become an elite finisher as well \u2026,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the great ability with his sixth sense to kind of read situations sometimes before they even have happen.\u201d What\u2019s the cap on Ja Morant\u2019s ceiling in Year Two? Morant already has shown he can be among the NBA\u2019s best at finishing games. He was the league\u2019s seventh-best scorer in the fourth quarter, trailing James Harden, Trae Young, LeBron James, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Donovan Mitchell. Morant shot 54.9% in the fourth quarter, second only to Antetokounmpo. \u201cJa has gone above and beyond this summer working on his shot \u2026,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to take big steps this year. The numbers will be the numbers. He\u2019s just making the right decisions, trusting the work behind it. They go hand in hand, and we\u2019re going to get the right numbers at the end of day.\u201d Morant, who turned 21 in August, is working on his off-court decision-making. He was seen on video attending a party at a Memphis nightclub Thanksgiving weekend without a mask during a spike in the coronavirus pandemic. He said he should have worn a mask throughout the party \u2014 or maybe not have gone \u2014 noting he\u2019s still learning all the protocols the NBA expects of players this season. Morant still carries a big chip on his shoulder, and is working to prove it would be mistake to overlook the Grizzlies He said if he continues putting in the work, \u201cI might be able to do that.\u201d"},{"id":449989,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10-potential-breakout-candidates","date":"2020-12-18","title":"Michael Porter Jr., Coby White among 10 potential breakout candidates","content":"Two sets of teammates comprise the list, as well as a couple of other youngsters already coming off breakout campaigns. With the start of 2020-21 regular season rapidly approaching, we decided to run down, alphabetically, 10 of the NBA\u2019s intriguing young up-and-comers that you need to keep an eye on this season: Luguentz Dort, Oklahoma City Thunder: Considered one of the breakout players of the NBA bubble, Dort forced his way into the starting lineup as a rookie last season on the strength of suffocating defense, which we saw in the playoffs when he locked down James Harden . Dort averaged 12.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and an assist starting in six of seven games in OKC\u2019s opening-round series loss to the Rockets. Dort pumped up the production in Games 6 and 7 of that series to a 21.5-point average, including a 30 piece in Game 7 to join LeBron James and Kobe Bryant as the only players to score 25 points or more in a Game 7 at the age of 21 or younger. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder: He increased production in virtually every statistical category over his first two seasons in the NBA, and now appears poised to become the focal point of a rebuilding franchise that features more than 10 new players on the roster. Gilgeous-Alexander said he spent the offseason preparing for the increased on-ball opportunities he\u2019ll be afforded with new head coach Mark Daigneault. So, while it\u2019s safe to say the 2019-20 season served as Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s true breakout season, we\u2019re expecting even more in 2020-21 from the point guard with freakish 6-foot-11 wingspan and the skillset to solidify standing as one of the NBA\u2019s elite two-way players. Talen Horton-Tucker, Los Angeles Lakers: The 20-year old\u2019s legend seems to grow by the day , and it\u2019s becoming clear that Lakers coach Frank Vogel needs to find a way to play him more minutes in the team\u2019s deep rotation. A second-year player, Horton-Tucker dropped 19 points to go with nine rebounds in the exhibition opener, then poured in another 33 points in Game 2 of the preseason. Teammate LeBron James tweeted lofty praise for Horton-Tucker, and Memphis Grizzlies great Tony Allen even told a hilarious story about his first encounter with the Lakers guard. The truth is we all caught a small glimpse of what\u2019s to come for Horton-Tucker back in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals . De\u2019Andre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks: Averaged 12.3 points as a rookie last season, but he shot 41% from the floor and 35.5% from deep; numbers we expect to improve this season, especially after watching Hunter hit 50% from 3-point range over the first two games of the preseason. Considered by coach Lloyd Pierce as Atlanta\u2019s best defender, Hunter still needs to be more consistent in that area. He\u2019s also looking to improve consistency and aggression on the offensive end in a bid to snag the full-time starting job at small forward. So far, so good in that department. Michael Porter Jr., Denver Nuggets: NBA Twitter quickly commenced to pearl clutching in the aftermath of Porter calling for more involvement in Denver\u2019s offense after its Game 4 loss to the L.A. Clippers. The audacity, they said. But Porter now receives the increased involvement he sought with a spot in the starting lineup, in part, because of the free-agency departure of Jerami Grant. Porter averaged 11.4 points and 6.7 rebounds in the playoffs, hitting 38.2% from long range, but he\u2019s got to become more consistent defensively to stick in the lineup for coach Michael Malone, who said, \u201cMichael\u2019s greatest challenge is understanding the importance of the defensive end, and buying into that on the floor.\u201d Cam Reddish, Atlanta Hawks: Competing with Hunter for a spot in the starting lineup, Reddish provided solid defense as a rookie last season playing 26.7 minutes per game with 34 starts, but it took a little while for the offense to start flowing. Throughout the preseason, Hunter appears to have gained a leg up for the starting spot at the 3 with solid exhibition performances, while Reddish has played through a sore ankle. As one of Atlanta\u2019s core young players, Reddish has a bright future with the franchise. The only hindrance could be the team\u2019s offseason roster additions. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers: Availability is your best ability, and Sexton hasn\u2019t missed a game in his first two seasons. In each of his first two seasons, Sexton found a way to boost production and finished last season with a true shooting percentage of 56%, while averaging 20.8 points and racking up 30 points or more in five games. Now it\u2019s time for Sexton to grow as a playmaker, and J.B. Bickerstaff should be able to facilitate that for a player that averaged just three assists last season. Sexton and Darius Garland have the potential to turn out to be one of the league\u2019s more dynamic backcourts. Gary Trent Jr., Portland Trail Blazers: A second-round pick in 2018, Trent became extension eligible this offseason but said he wants to finish out his current deal and head into restricted free agency next summer, which essentially means he\u2019s betting on himself this season after a strong showing in the bubble. Trent\u2019s minutes increased to 21.8 per game last season, after he averaged just 7.4 minutes as a rookie. Trent connected on 41.8% from deep last season, but he truly shined in the bubble with lockdown perimeter defense while averaging 16.9 points on 50.7% from long range. Blazers president of basketball operations Neil Olshey said Trent developed into \u201cthe default sixth man to a degree.\u201d Coby White, Chicago Bulls: The blazing speed is what stood out for White last season as a 19-year-old rookie, who averaged 13.2 points and 2.7 assists in 25.8 minutes per game. In averaging 20.7 points over the first three preseason games on 53.5% from the floor and 57.9% from deep, White has already displayed even more growth and diversity in getting to the rack by throwing in more hesitations. The No. 7 pick in the 2019 draft could see his game grow exponentially over the next few seasons working now as the starting point guard in Chicago with Billy Donovan at the helm. Christian Wood, Houston Rockets: He\u2019s 25 and on his sixth team since entering the league in 2015. So, immediately, you\u2019d think of Wood as a journeyman. But he\u2019s got the perfect opportunity to stack another breakout campaign on top of what he did last season in Detroit if the drama in Houston doesn\u2019t get in the way. Wood started a career-high 12 games last season and played so well the Rockets extended a $41 million deal. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Teams will play two games \u2014 one home and one on the road \u2014 against the 15 opponents in the other conference. But intraconference games have been reduced, with teams playing three games against each of their 14 conference opponents. Given the uncertainty of playing and traveling outside a controlled environment, only 52% (558) of this season\u2019s 1,080 games have been announced, with the remainder to come at a later date. Those 558 games will take us to an All-Star break (with no All-Star Game) that begins on March 5. Every team has 37 or 38 games in the first half of the schedule, with both the number of home games and the number of road games ranging from 17-20. That\u2019s slightly more balanced than you might see from a normal schedule (a few teams had a five-game differential through their first 41 games last season). Unfortunately, the league\u2019s run of five straight years of reducing the number of back-to-backs is likely over. Last season\u2019s schedule (which wasn\u2019t completed in full) had teams averaging 12.4 back-to-backs, down from 19.3 in 2014-15. In the first half of the schedule this season, teams will average 7.0 back-to-backs. Related to that, there are 32 stretches of five games in seven nights, compared to 19 in the entirety of last season\u2019s unfinished schedule. We\u2019ve seen home-and-home series before, where two teams play consecutive games in each other\u2019s arena. And we have four of those (the Minnesota Timberwolves play two) in the first half schedule. Two straight games in the same arena is something new. But with a need to reduce travel and simplify logistics, 57 same-arena, two-game series have been built into the first half schedule. Some of them are back-to-backs (two games in two nights) and some include a day off in between. The Miami Heat lead the league with seven two-game series, four at home and three on the road. The first is a playoff rematch with the Milwaukee Bucks, who will be at AmericanAirlines Arena for a back-to-back on Dec. 29 and 30. The Heat have more marquee two-game series against the Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors and Brooklyn Nets (all on the road in January). The Memphis Grizzlies and Orlando Magic are next with six two-game series apiece. Three teams \u2014 the Denver Nuggets , the New Orleans Pelicans and the New York Knicks \u2014 have just one (on the road for all three teams). The first two-game series will be Saturday-Sunday back-to-backs on the first weekend of the season, with the Magic playing in Washington and the Phoenix Suns spending the weekend in Sacramento. With pandemic restrictions in Canada preventing the Toronto Raptors from playing their home games at home, they\u2019ve relocated to Tampa, Fla. and will play their first-half home games at Amalie Arena. The Raptors are one of the five teams with three more road games (20) than home games (17) in the first half of the schedule. They play 10 of their first 14 games on the road, but then have their longest Tampa homestand of the first half, six games from Jan. 19-29. It includes two-game series against New Orleans and Dallas. The temporary move gives the league three teams in Florida and puts the Raps within a 90-minute drive of Orlando. But the first-half schedule doesn\u2019t really take that proximity into account, as only one team is playing in both Orlando and Tampa on the same road trip. That team is the Sacramento Kings, who will have a \u201cFlorida Triangle\u201d excursion built into a six-game, nine-day trip through the Southeast. After playing a back-to-back in Memphis on Jan. 24 and 25, the Kings will play in Orlando on Jan. 27, in Tampa on Jan. 29, and in Miami on Jan. 30. They\u2019ll then finish the trip in New Orleans on Feb. 1. For comparison, six teams are playing consecutive road games at New York and Brooklyn, while eight are playing consecutive road games against the Clippers and Lakers in L.A. Zion Williamson is a must-see talent and, after playing just 24 games and having his minutes limited last season, he\u2019s healthy and ready to be unleashed. Williamson was the rare rookie who made his team better. So there\u2019s reason to believe that, though the Pelicans traded Jrue Holiday, they can compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference if he stays healthy and more than doubles his minutes total ( 668 ) from last season. The Pelicans replaced Holiday with Eric Bledsoe, replaced Derrick Favors with Steven Adams, and made a coaching change (hiring Stan Van Gundy) that should help a defense that looked awful in some critical games last season. But New Orleans will be tested in the first half of the season. The Pelicans have the league\u2019s toughest first-half schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage from last season (.542). It\u2019s also the toughest when we take opponents\u2019 point differential (per 100 possessions) from last season and adjust for location and rest. The Pelicans have a league-high 20 first-half games against the 13 teams that had winning records last season. Two of those 20 games are against the Oklahoma City Thunder (expected to fall off), but four of their other 17 first-half games are against the Phoenix Suns (three) and Portland Trail Blazers (one), two teams that should be better after having losing records last season. Their first-half schedule includes a 13-day, seven-game trip (Jan. 11-23) that includes games against the Mavs, Clippers and Lakers, along with a two-game series in Utah (the Pelicans\u2019 only two-game series of the first-half schedule). Rest advantage = Didn\u2019t play the day before. Opponent is playing the second game of a back-to-back. Rest disadvantage = Playing the second game of a back-to-back.

Neither Kevin Durant nor Kyrie Irving are natural leaders, and the chafing that traditionally would go in between the media in a major market and their touchy personalities could chip away at the team\u2019s basketball goals. But Zoom sessions can\u2019t be nearly as annoying as crushing, in-person scrums. And the East is competitive enough that it\u2019s hard to count out any of six or seven possible survivors. Don\u2019t see the Nets winning a title anytime soon, but I can\u2019t muster much of a case for them being incapable of reaching The Finals. Shaun Powell : The ceiling for Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving is definitely the NBA Finals because the East lacks a superteam \u2014 actually, the Lakers are the only superteam in the NBA \u2014 and the feeling is those stars can coexist. However, if the support help in Brooklyn falters or struggles to connect with those two, then the Nets are just another top-five East team. John Schuhmann : A healthy and engaged Kevin Durant could be the best player in the league, and not just because of his offense. Over the last 10 seasons, there have been 12 instances of a player averaging at least 25 points with a true shooting percentage of 63% or better, and Durant accounts for six. But the Nets\u2019 first preseason game was as much a reminder of how much of a force he can be defensively . So the ceiling is obviously high, and the Nets have a lot of solid players around their two stars. If it all comes together, a championship isn\u2019t out of the question. Sekou Smith : Call me crazy, but I think the Nets could make The Finals with KD and Kyrie. We\u2019re talking about two of the league\u2019s most talented players with championships already under their belts. Durant\u2019s a two-time Finals MVP. And Kyrie hit the biggest shot in Cavaliers history as he helped them fight back from 3-1 down to shock the 73-win Warriors in 2016. I\u2019m not suggesting the Nets have everything in place for this team to scale those heights this season. But they certainly can if a bunch of things fall their way and KD and Kyrie are healthy and leading the way. Michael C. Wright : As good as those two are, the Nets are probably the sixth seed in the East. But the fun part of that is Durant and Irving are talented enough to take Brooklyn all the way to the conference finals. That\u2019s not exactly a hot take. Both dazzled in the preseason opener, and I\u2019m really not buying into concerns about whether the partnership can work throughout the season because of the solid coaching staff and front office in Brooklyn."},{"id":448294,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-bold-predictions-for-the-2020-21-season","date":"2020-12-18","title":"Blogtable: Bold predictions for the 2020-21 season","content":"*** What is your boldest prediction for the 2020-21 season? *** Steve Aschburner : The Milwaukee Bucks are going to  not only make the Finals this postseason, they\u2019re going to win the 2021 NBA championship . I think the onus of Giannis\u2019 contract being gone will propel them past their two disappointments in the 2019 and 2020 playoffs. They can use a new Larry O\u2019Brien trophy to book-end the championship\u2019s lone franchise precisely 50 years earlier. And they can prove 81% of NBA general managers wrong in one fell swoops. Shaun Powell : The Portland Trail Blazers win the title . This is Damian Lillard\u2019s best team yet and, as we saw in the bubble, he\u2019s thirsty for that first championship. A superstar plus depth will put Portland on the doorstep; some luck will push them into the promised land. John Schuhmann : The Dallas Mavericks will finish in the top three in the Western Conference. The Mavs finished third in the West in point differential (+4.9 points per game) last season, with a healthy margin between them and the fourth-ranked Rockets (+3.0). But they finished seventh in the standings because they struggled (especially offensively) down the stretch of close games. If they turn around their late-game fortunes, improve defensively with the addition of Josh Richardson, and see continued improvement from Luka Doncic, the Mavs are a more serious Western Conference contender than they appear to be on the surface. Sekou Smith : You asked for bold. But I figured overboard might be more appropriate in 2020. Houston\u2019s on the clock. James Harden wants out. Daryl Morey\u2019s in Philadelphia. Following the dots here? Harden to Philly in a package involving Ben Simmons and the Sixers, with Harden and Embiid leading the way, crash the Eastern Conference playoff party and make The Finals with Doc Rivers pulling the strings \u2026 you said bold, right? Michael C. Wright : Since I reside here, let\u2019s keep it in Texas. The fourth player since the merger to win the scoring title for three straight years, Houston\u2019s James Harden won\u2019t lead the league in scoring for a fourth consecutive season . Furthermore, the Rockets will eventually move Harden to another squad sometime before the late March trade deadline, and he won\u2019t be headed to any of the teams on his reported wish list of contenders. Upon arrival at the new destination, Harden will produce at a clip similar to what we\u2019re all accustomed to, but it won\u2019t be enough to boost his average to another scoring title."},{"id":448361,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-will-lakers-repeat-as-champions-in-2020-21","date":"2020-12-18","title":"Blogtable: Will Lakers repeat as champions in 2020-21?","content":"* * * The NBA\u2019s general managers have overwhelmingly (81%) picked the Lakers to win it all again in 2021. What say you? * * * Steve Aschburner : I\u2019d say the GMs of this league are about as shrewd, insightful and risk-tolerant as your average fan on the street . The Lakers were defending champions when the bubble ended and, in a clear consensus of opinions, got better this offseason by adding the likes of Dennis Schroder, Montrezl Harrell, Wesley Matthews and Marc Gasol. OK, they lost some perimeter defense now that Rajon Rondo, Avery Bradley and Danny Green have moved on, but this autumn breakout of Talen Horton-Tucker suggests he\u2019s capable of helping at both ends. LeBron James and Anthony Davis are constants, so the GMs are totally playing it safe. Shaun Powell : I\u2019ll take the Lakers over the field . Not only do they have LeBron James and Anthony Davis going for them (health permitting of course), but they upgraded at nearly every position in the off-season. Finally: Without needing to play before hostile road crowds that would give underdogs some hope and momentum in the playoffs, the no-fans format once again is favorable to LA. So, yeah, it\u2019s a Laker World; deal with it. John Schuhmann : Given what we know about the league\u2019s contenders, the champs are the favorite, for sure. But we still have a lot to learn about both the Lakers and the teams chasing them. The Clippers, Nets, Bucks and Sixers (along with the Lakers themselves) all made major changes , while the Mavs, Nuggets, Celtics and Heat all have young stars that should continue to get better. Given the circumstances of this season, it could be tougher than usual for new groups\/combinations to find a rhythm, but let\u2019s call the Lakers the clear preseason favorites and revisit this in March or April. Sekou Smith : Having witnessed the Lakers grind through the Orlando bubble to the title, it\u2019s hard to imagine another team beating a healthy LeBron James-Anthony Davis-led team four times in a playoff series. Maybe it\u2019s more likely to happen in a normal playoff setting, which I am counting on to finish this season. But based on the way they finished the job in the bubble, it\u2019s hard to imagine someone taking them down. The league\u2019s general managers (well, the 81% at least) are right on this one. It\u2019s the Lakers at the top of the heap until another legitimate challenger emerges this season. Michael C. Wright : Tough to disagree with the GMs based off the moves the Lakers made this offseason to fortify depth while upgrading at other spots, especially in the frontcourt. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle recently talked about how the Lakers won the 2019-20 championship with defense that generated a good portion of their offense. That element is still there for the Lakers, as is their versatility to play either big or small. Besides that, it\u2019s never a good idea to bet against the league\u2019s best player in LeBron James when he\u2019s paired with such a marquee talent in Anthony Davis."},{"id":448383,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-makes-your-25-and-under-all-nba-team","date":"2020-12-18","title":"Blogtable: Who makes your 25-and-under All-NBA team?","content":"* * * Name your 25-and-under All-NBA starting five going into this season. * * * Steve Aschburner : We\u2019re fully in the era of positionless basketball, right?

Shaun Powell : Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum . Sorry, Ben Simmons. Not yet, Zion Williamson. John Schuhmann : Bam Adebayo \u2026 The hub of a top-10 offense and one of the league\u2019s best defenders. Luka Doncic \u2026 Legit MVP candidate at 21, given that he ran the league\u2019s best offense with its third highest usage rate. Nikola Jokic \u2026 Probably the best passing big man of all time. He\u2019s an efficient, 20-points-per-game scorer, too. Ben Simmons \u2026 A force in transition, a terrific passer, and the league\u2019s best perimeter defender. Jayson Tatum \u2026 Became both a great scorer and great defender last season. Playmaking is the next step. Sekou Smith : This is a tough call with all the spectacular 25-and-under talent available in the league these days.

Same guy, same place, but an entirely different vibe and future for both the two-time MVP and the Bucks. They can concentrate on the business of chasing an NBA championship not just this season but for several years to come. Heck, imagine the fretting and edginess of 2020-21 for all concerned in Milwaukee if Antetokounmpo had not signed his five-year, $228 million \u201csuper-max\u201d extension. This could have slammed shut their window as title contenders. There also is carryover impact to the NBA at large with this signing, in what it means for a smaller market to hang onto one of the league\u2019s very best. That\u2019s been a flaw in the NBA \u2013 far fewer superstars than teams \u2013 but now we\u2019ve seen the Bucks hang onto its MVP as surely as the MLB Brewers (Christian Yelich) and the NFL Packers (Aaron Rodgers) did theirs. Shaun Powell : Are we counting Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s contract extension here? If so, that\u2019s the one. If not, then Jrue Holiday. Not because I\u2019m as bullish on Jrue as everyone else \u2014 he\u2019s only made one All-Star team and no All-NBA teams and his teams have only reached the playoffs twice since 2012 \u2014 but his signing swayed Giannis into inking that extension. John Schuhmann : Giannis Antetokounmpo putting pen to paper on the extension that has him under contract for at least five more seasons is more important than any free agent contract that was signed. Not only is the two-time Kia MVP a two-way force who would have changed the league landscape by leaving Milwaukee, but that signature should help the Bucks over the next six months. They won\u2019t have the distraction of impending free agency and, with less pressure to win this season, they can experiment more with their rotation and schemes. That could, in turn, lead to more versatility and better preparedness for the playoffs. Sekou Smith : Hands down it\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo signing that super max extension in Milwaukee. Not only was it a glorious Christmas present for Bucks fans, the city of Milwaukee and the state of Wisconsin, it removes a layer of foolishness from this NBA season now that there won\u2019t be speculation every time the Bucks roll into certain cities. When you keep the reigning and two-time Kia MVP in the fold, it\u2019s obviously a monstrous victory for the front office crew that worked to make it happen. Michael C. Wright : Pairing Jrue Holiday with Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee comes to mind immediately, as does the Russell Westbrook trade to Washington. But the Chris Paul trade to Phoenix should lead to immediate results for an up-and-coming Suns team, where young stars Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton will benefit from the veteran\u2019s leadership and tutelage. Paul\u2019s past experience with Monty Williams should contribute to a level of trust between those two, while making the point guard an extension of the coach on the floor. It\u2019s a move that could push the Suns into the playoffs for the first time since 2010 in an already tough conference that only continues to improve."},{"id":448376,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-which-second-year-players-could-make-a-big-leap-in-2020-21","date":"2020-12-18","title":"Blogtable: Which second-year players could make a big leap?","content":"* * * Luka Doncic and Trae Young went from standout rookies to All-Stars in 2019-20. Which second-year players could make a similar jump this season? * * * Steve Aschburner : It\u2019s quite a leap to become an All-Star in one\u2019s second season. Tricky, too, because the player has to up his production, help boost his team\u2019s record and be in line to get a big chunk of the credit for that. A player like Tyler Herro, for instance, could light it up in the first half of this season and still miss out with Jimmy Butler and new star Bam Adebayo ahead of him in Miami\u2019s pecking order. Memphis guard Ja Morant\u2019s team was still underwater by the end of January, which might have cost him them. Still, I\u2019ll go with Morant and Zion Williamson , who get plenty of spotlight with the Grizzlies and the Pelicans. If their teams start strong, both could see stars by their names. Shaun Powell : The sensible answer is Zion Williamson and Ja Morant, the Nos. 1 and 2 picks who were, and are, heads and shoulders above everyone else in that class. If we\u2019re looking for a sleeper pick, then Coby White and\/or Tyler Herro bring the best credentials . John Schuhmann : Ja Morant and Zion Williamson are the obvious answers and between the two, I\u2019d favor Morant. He\u2019ll have the ball in his hands and he\u2019s a terror in the pick-and-roll , combining ridiculous quickness with pretty sophisticated savvy. Coby White isn\u2019t on that level, but has had a very intriguing preseason thus far and will seemingly be given every opportunity to run the Bulls\u2019 offense. There are probably too many good players in Miami for Tyler Herro to make that leap this season, but he could get there (to Young level, at least) in time. Sekou Smith : Ja Morant and Zion Williamson are first in line. They are the two biggest names from last season\u2019s rookie class and the two guys set up for the production needed to join the All-Star fray this season. They\u2019ve have to follow in the footsteps of Luka and Trae to get there. And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s possible, statistically or in the standings. The field is crowded as well, with a long list of All-Stars at their respective positions already in place. They are definitely next up, I\u2019m just not sure when that time will come for either one of these talented youngsters. Michael C. Wright : It\u2019s Ja Morant and Zion Williamson for me because they\u2019re simply the most explosive, exciting players of last year\u2019s draft class. Morant seems to hunt bigs to dunk on, which leads to the viral clips we all love to see, not to mention the fact his rookie stats were better than Derrick Rose\u2019s numbers in his first season. And Rose made his first All-Star Game in Year 2. As for Williamson, we all caught a glimpse of him for just 24 games last season due to his knee injury, and he was playing under a minutes restriction during all of those outings."},{"id":449685,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-digital-debuts-redesigned-digital-products-league-pass-enhancements-for-2020-21-season","date":"2020-12-18","title":"NBA Digital debuts redesigned digital products, League Pass enhancements for 2020-21 season","content":"NBA Digital, jointly managed by the NBA and Turner Sports, has debuted a newly redesigned NBA App and NBA.com for NBA fans globally, featuring new and expanded features on NBA League Pass and NBA TV in time for the NBA season tip-off on Tuesday, Dec. 22.

That is the third highest rate in the history of the survey, trailing only the Golden State Warriors in 2017-18 (93%) and 2018-19 (87%). Set to turn 36 at the end of December, James continues to earn the respect of GMs, named as the league\u2019s best small forward (for the 14th time in the last 15 years), its best passer (for the fourth straight season), and its most versatile player. A handful of GMs also think he can win a fifth MVP award. With the plurality of the votes, Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo is favored to become just the fourth player in NBA history to win the award three straight years. But that race appears wide open. And if they were starting a new franchise, as many GMs would pick 21-year-old Luka Doncic. With the abbreviated offseason, we have a (somewhat) abbreviated GM Survey, along with one question about the unique challenges presented by the current environment. The GMs responded to 33 different questions about the best teams, players, coaches and offseason moves. General managers were not permitted to vote for their own team or personnel. Percentages are based on the pool of respondents to that particular question, rather than all 30 GMs. Predictions | Players | Offseason Moves | Rookies & International | Coaches | Miscellaneous  A.

He knew things were changing dramatically in real time, without the benefit of actually interacting on the court with each new member of the team in the normal lead-up to the start of a new season. He tweeted that it had that first day of school feel to it. \u201cI was excited. I was excited, first, about getting everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew some things were going to happen, and we had a lot of roster spots to fill, and so I knew there was going to be some things that happened. So I was happy with what happened, and excited about what we got, and excited about playing. I talked to a couple of guys about coming in and playing, and what we could do, and what we could do together.\u201d A transformative offseason included a free-agent haul of Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kris Dunn and Rajon Rondo. Added to the trade-deadline acquisition of Clint Capela last season, the moves cast the Hawks in a completely different light moving into the 2020-21 season. Instead of all the attention being focused on their latest lottery pick, USC center Onyeka Okongwu, it\u2019s on a group of veteran role players added to a young core led by their All-Star point guard and ascending power forward John Collins. This is clearly a team on the rise, at least on paper, a team looking to end a three-year playoff drought. But how big a jump are we talking about? Into the playoff field in an improved Eastern Conference? Perhaps even the top six? Higher? The revamped Hawks are primed to challenge for playoff contention. Schlenk and Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce have decided to let others play the prediction game. It\u2019s a wise move, given the boatload of variables teams will deal with this season under the COVID-19 protocols and all that comes along with these trying times. But there\u2019s no denying the increased urgency. The next phase of this franchise makeover is upon them, and so too are all of the expectations \u2014 internal and beyond \u2014 that come with it. \u201cA lot of that remains to be seen,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI think on paper, you\u2019re excited about the follow through of the plan. We went into this hoping to get some good free agents and hoping to have a nice young draft pick to add to our young core. Really excited about the guys that are here, the wealth of experience, the versatility, and just adding some experience with some young guys. So I imagine we\u2019ll be competitive, but that\u2019s going to be up to us and what we define as competitive.\u201d Schlenk was as measured as he was meticulous with the additions, dating back to the acquisition of Capela last season. He didn\u2019t reach for superstar talent that wasn\u2019t really attainable, one of those offseason gestures franchises make to convince themselves (and perhaps more pointedly, their fans) that they are serious about improving. He identified plug-and-play pieces, guys that fit the mold of the building blocks the franchise needs to make that incremental climb from the lottery to the playoffs. The Hawks added Bojan Bogdanovic in free agency to bolster offensive options. Grabbing Gallinari (3-year, $61 million deal) fortifies the forward rotation, led by a rising young star in Collins now supported by a versatile and dependable veteran presence off the bench. The offer sheet (4-year, $72 million) for Bogdanovic \u2014 that the Sacramento Kings declined to match \u2014 provides Young with a running mate in the backcourt, one who eases the need for Young to run a solo show to keep the Hawks competitive on a given night. Dunn arrives (2-years, $10 million) with plenty still to prove and the requisite chip on his shoulder, as he moves into a defensive stopper role off the bench after being miscast as a starter in Chicago. Rondo coming aboard (2-year, $15 million) serves the dual purpose of a being a mentor for Young and filling the leadership void left after Future Hall of Famer Vince Carter retired. During the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 title run in the Orlando bubble, Rondo showed he remains plenty capable of providing meaningful minutes on a playoff team. Helping another team dig out of a playoff drought \u2014 the Lakers\u2019 had lasted seven years \u2014 was just the sort of challenge Rondo sought at this stage of his career. \u201cThis is a young, talented team obviously,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cTrae Young, John Collins, Kevin Huerter. These young guys have an extreme amount of upside. And to me, honestly, I didn\u2019t think the East was very tough this year, as far as talent, I think it\u2019s p for grabs as which team will prevail at the top. And I just think with this young team, a lot of young guys willing to learn and with the upside they have, I wanted to come and join it and help something on the rise and on an upswing here in the city of Atlanta.\u201d Will Rajon Rondo help Trae Young shine? He has a good idea what that looks like, having competed against the Hawks (and his \u201cbrother\u201d and high school teammate and roommate Josh Smith) in the first round during his championship season with Boston in 2008. \u201cI remember what it was like when we played against Josh back in [2008] and the city of Atlanta in the playoffs and I kind of want to get the city back into that type of feel. Hopefully things will be a little more controlled and calmed down by then, closer to May and June, and we can get the fans back in State Farm [Arena] and get it rocking.\u201d It remains to be seen if the health and safety guidelines will allow for any duplication of that electric playoff atmosphere Rondo remembers. But what that Hawks team ignited, a 10-year playoff run that culminated in a 60-win season and Eastern Conference finals appearance in 2015, provides an ambitious and realistic blueprint for the future, a blueprint the Hawks have followed to the letter. They stayed the course, building through the draft and piling up assets to use down the line in trades and free agency. Capela\u2019s acquisition was the first big move; every step since has been next in the evolution envisioned by the Hawks\u2019 brass. \u201cI think we hit a home run in free agency in terms of having the money and having the options and going after guys that we thought would be a part of our next step,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cAnd so I think absolutely we haven\u2019t skipped a step. We\u2019re going to grow and develop our young guys, and we\u2019re going to be really competitive this year, and we\u2019re going to keep leveling up what we define as being competitive, but this is the necessary step. And this was all part of the plan.\u201d Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce has been tasked with boosting player development toward playoff success. And that includes any added pressure that comes with the movement, Pierce said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go into free agency and take this next step to not put pressure on ourselves, to not really try and advance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we all understand that advancing is postseason, and I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it. I\u2019m not going to limit what I think postseason is for us, and I think when you talk about being competitive, the forefront of competition and having the guys that we have, that\u2019s always going to be at the forefront. We expect to win. We expect to be competitive. And I expect to see that on the practice court every day. We\u2019re going to define who we are and what we are as we move forward.\u201d In a league dominated by playoff teams built on built on dynamic duos, Young and Collins are still in the fresh faces of the franchise. They are still in the developmental stages of a potential All-Star partnership that could serve as the fuel cell for the Hawks\u2019 next decade. \u201cWe\u2019re taking that next year, that second-year jump,\u201d Collins said. \u201cSo I feel like the expectations are high on all of us. We\u2019ve shown potential and we\u2019ve shown just flashes of greatness. And now we\u2019ve added other solid NBA players, veterans, who have proven themselves in this league. I just feel like when you look at our team on paper and then you look at our ages and you look at all the positives, your mind just starts to race. And I feel like we\u2019re there too. We\u2019re excited, but we need to, for our young guys, grow up a little bit, and I feel like for the older guys, just give that experience and lend their knowledge to us.\u201d As for the immediate future, the Hawks have to dig out of the rubble after two disappointing seasons. They were deliberate, of course, choosing the ugliness that usually accompanies these sorts of things. A young and inexperienced core with journeymen and fringe talents duct-taped all over the roster tends to produce outcomes like the 49-100 mark the Hawks racked up in Young\u2019s first two seasons. Even the most jaded of fans can see bigger and better things on the horizon. How Trae Young can level up in Year Three. An All-Star starter last season, Young is eying an opportunity to wipe away the sting of losing and put the Hawks in the spotlight, while also solidifying his position as one of the league\u2019s best players. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s good to have people talking about Atlanta basketball right now, and I want it to stay this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThis city deserves it. This organization, we have a lot of exciting pieces, a lot of exciting players, and this city just needs this type of excitement for basketball. And so it\u2019s good that we\u2019re getting a lot of attention right now, but we need to find a way to continue to win games, and find a way to win games right when the season starts.\u201d All of that will start with Young diving into his new situation, both as a catalyst on the floor and leader off of it. Flashy highlights and impressive individual numbers are fine. When they come without the wins and the opportunity to perform on the league\u2019s most meaningful stage, in the postseason \u2026 that\u2019s the motivation that drives Young. \u201cJust having that narrative that I can\u2019t win, and it\u2019s obviously showing up to this point, obviously we haven\u2019t won very many games, but my track record playing basketball, I\u2019ve won my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cI took a team in college from not supposed to make the tournament, to the top five in the country, and top four in the country at one point, and led us to the tournament. It\u2019s more about, for me, it\u2019s just changing that narrative that I can\u2019t win.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

With tip-off days away on Dec. 22, fantasy basketball managers need to start preparing for their draft and the season that lies ahead. As is the case in nearly all fantasy sports, acquiring exceptional value during your draft is more meaningful to winning that title than who you take within the first couple rounds. While you can lose the draft by taking on too much risk early, we generally know what the stable early-round ballers bring to the table and their high price leaves no equity built into their cost. So which late-round athletes have value that may far exceed their price? We\u2019ve got our featured analysts in to assist you with that and help you dominate your draft! Read on to see who you should be targeting late. Q. What one player outside the top 120 is your favorite sleeper target and why? Seth Curry (PG\/SG \u2013 PHI): ECR \u2013 121st Overall \u201cJosh Richardson may have been the headline of the draft-day trade between the Mavericks and 76ers, but Curry could be the individual player that benefits the most. He averaged 24.6 minutes per game in a supporting role in Dallas last season and now steps into the starting lineup at the position that gave both Richardson and J.J. Reddick over 30 minutes per game in recent years. Curry has an impressive 44.3% career three-point shooting percentage and he was even better last season at 45.2%. He should get plenty of opportunities to rack up threes while spacing the court alongside Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, and Tobias Harris, but don\u2019t sleep on his underrated ability to drive the lane when the opportunity presents itself. He\u2019s the perfect player to help boost your fantasy roster\u2019s shooting percentages all around.\u201d \u2013 Aaron Larson (FantasyPros) \u201cDon\u2019t snooze on Seth Curry. The seven-year player out of Duke projects to be the starting SG for Philadelphia this season. He currently sits at 121 in the latest expert consensus rankings and is extremely undervalued given the role he\u2019ll play for the Sixers. Ben Simmons is among the leaders in assisted three-pointers and with Curry having the second-highest 3PT percentage in NBA history (trailing Steve Kerr), he\u2019ll get plenty of opportunities to flourish in this offense. With per-36 minutes averages of 18.1 PPG, 3.3 REB, 2.8 APG, and 3.3 3PM last season, I think he\u2019ll come very close to hitting those numbers as the poor man\u2019s C.J. McCollum of the Sixers.\u201d \u2013 Dan Titus (FantasyPros) Spencer Dinwiddie (PG\/SG \u2013 BKN): ECR \u2013 131st Overall \u201cDinwiddie is currently 134th in the latest expert consensus rankings, but someone who I believe has a lot of potential late in fantasy drafts. He had a career season in 2019-20, averaging 20.6 points, 6.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds, 0.6 steals, and 1.9 triples across 31.2 minutes. The 27-year-old also had a 28.7 usage rate and an offensive rating of 110.5. Dinwiddie did sit out the NBA restart in Orlando after testing positive for COVID-19, but is all systems go for 2020-21. The Nets will have superstars Kevin Durant (Achilles) and Kyrie Irving (shoulder) back from injury for the 2020-21 campaign. Durant has been out of action since the 2019 NBA Finals and Irving hasn\u2019t played in 70 games since the 2016-17 season. The chances of Durant and Irving staying healthy for the entire season are slim and fantasy managers witnessed Dinwiddie thrive in a primary role last year. Even with Durant and Irving on the court, Dinwiddie is expected to be a top-three option on the Nets\u2019 offense and will be a player I am targeting in the later rounds of fantasy drafts.\u201d \u2013 Brad Camara (FantasyPros) Malik Beasley (PG\/SG \u2013 MIN): ECR \u2013 123rd Overall \u201cBeasley is criminally underrated heading into the 2020-21 season. After joining the Timberwolves via trade from the Nuggets last season, he immediately entered the starting lineup and averaged 20.7 points (47.2% FG), 5.1 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and just 1.5 turnovers in 33 minutes per game for Minnesota. He was rewarded with a handsome four-year, $60M extension for his 14-game performance. Based on the first preseason game, it looks like Beasley will be the third option on offense behind D\u2019Angelo Russell and Karl-Anthony Towns. It\u2019s not very often a guy ranked outside the top 120 has the potential to average 20+ points in 30+ minutes per game, so make sure you give Beasley a long, hard look after the top-100 players are off the board.\u201d \u2013 Adam Koffler (FantasyPros) Troy Brown (SG\/SF \u2013 WAS): ECR \u2013 167th Overall \u201cI want every part of the Wizards\u2019 offense this year and Brown looks vastly underpriced to me as a result. Russell Westbrook has an incorrect stigma as a shot-hogger since he took a lot of them from Harden, but in the three years prior with OKC, he averaged a 47% assist rate. More importantly, Westbrook pushes the pace. The Wizards already ranked seventh in pace factor last year, which will undoubtedly go up, and Houston was a top-five pace team with Westbrook in and were bottom five with him out last year. Brown is an up-and-coming player that contributes in all five categories and the floor spacing with Westbrook running point should help Brown improve on his (already decent) 44% shooting from the field and 33% shooting from downtown while helping all other categories.\u201d \u2013 Jamie Calandro (Fantasy Team Advice) Elfrid Payton (PG \u2013 NYK): ECR \u2013 147th Overall \u201cBack with the Knicks, Payton is set up to blow away his current ECR. In his first season with New York in 2019-20, the Louisiana product averaged 10.0 points, 7.2 dimes, 4.7 boards, and 1.6 steals while providing fantasy managers some reliable nightly production. The Knicks added some additional scoring options in Alec Burks and Obi Toppin, which should only aid Payton\u2019s assist numbers. Health has been a major concern as of late (played 45 games or fewer in each of his last two seasons), but as long as he\u2019s on the court, Payton is oozing with triple-double upside. He\u2019s not a great shooter, but even marginal improvement in that area would be huge for his value.\u201d \u2013 Zachary Hanshew (FantasyPros) Nerlens Noel (PF\/C \u2013 NYK): ECR \u2013 140th Overall \u201cI\u2019m loving Noel at an ADP around 140. He\u2019s always been a great per-minute producer and new Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau seems poised to give Noel plenty of run at the center position. After starting each of New York\u2019s first two preseason games and averaging almost 23 minutes of court time, Noel is producing 6.5 points per game on 54.5% shooting, with nine rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.5 blocks, and a steal per contest. Mitchell Robinson continues to struggle with foul trouble and seems to be working his way into Thib\u2019s doghouse, opening the door for Noel to run with the current opportunity.\u201d \u2013 Jason Willan (The Fake Basketball) Chris Boucher (PF\/C \u2013 TOR): ECR \u2013 153rd Overall \u201cBoucher isn\u2019t going to start, but coach Nick Nurse says he will be the first big off the bench for the Raptors, which should vault his minutes into the low-to-mid 20s. That is more than enough playing time to provide mid-round value for a player who ranked 13th in the entire NBA in fantasy value per 36 minutes last season. Look for Boucher to be a big difference-maker in blocks and he can also chip in some points, rebounds, and threes without hurting you in the shooting percentages or turnovers. That is incredible value for a player ranked outside the top 150.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Seifter (FantasyPros) DeMarcus Cousins (PF\/C \u2013 HOU): ECR \u2013 170th Overall \u201cCousins is a name that I\u2019m targeting late in drafts that I think can easily outperform his ADP. While I understand that he\u2019s no longer the superstar that he was in New Orleans, his ECR of 170 seems disrespectfully low. Christian Wood has been flying up draft boards due to his opportunity as a big man in a James Harden-led offense, as we\u2019ve seen Clint Capela, P.J. Tucker, and Dwight Howard all find success in similar roles. While I agree that Wood is undoubtedly the center to own on this Houston squad, Cousins could find himself with more playing time as the season progresses or even starting in the unfortunate case of an injury. If he\u2019s able to carve out a role of 18-22 minutes per game, he could pay off as a scoring and rebounding machine on this high-powered Houston roster.\u201d \u2013 Dave Kluge (FantasyPros) James Wiseman (C \u2013 GSW): ECR \u2013 135th Overall \u201cWiseman is the talented rookie big man that landed at the perfect place. His 7\u20196\u201d wingspan should naturally lead to rebounds and blocks. On top of that, he is a post player than can run the floor and knock down long-range shots. Given the tempo that the Warriors like to play with when Stephen Curry is healthy, the opportunity for points and rebounds is going to be high and he could be a double-double machine very early on.\u201d \u2013 Zach Brunner (FlurrySports)"},{"id":448114,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-foundation-names-greg-taylor-as-executive-director","date":"2020-12-17","title":"NBA Foundation names Greg Taylor as Executive Director","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 The NBA Foundation Board of Directors today announced that Greg Taylor has been selected as the organization\u2019s first Executive Director.

MILWAUKEE \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo said he appreciated the love the city of Milwaukee has shown him ever since his arrival as an 18-year-old rookie from Greece. So the reigning two-time MVP decided to show his loyalty to the place where he\u2019s spent his entire NBA career. \u201cIt\u2019s the place I want to be,\u201d Antetokounmpo said Wednesday, one day after signing a supermax extension with the Bucks. \u201cIt\u2019s the place I want to raise my kids. I feel good here. My family feels good here, so I\u2019m good.\u201d Antetokounmpo could have become a free agent at the end of the upcoming season if he hadn\u2019t agreed to the deal, reportedly a five-year extension worth $228 million. Plenty of NBA teams were arranging their financial plans with the hope the 6-foot-11 \u201cGreek Freak\u201d would become available. He instead stuck around and said it was important to him that his loyalty be considered part of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019m a man of my word,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cThis is big. This is big. Being on a team that trusted me, believed in me, took care of me, took care of my family. I always want to give back and I\u2019ve been trying to give back since day one, since I\u2019ve been here. I\u2019ve got more to give.\u201d Family means plenty to Antetokounmpo, who became a father earlier this year and has one brother (Thanasis) on the Bucks and another (Kostas) on the Los Angeles Lakers. As he discussed what this contract extension means to him, he referenced his own father, Charles Antetokounmpo, who died of a heart attack in September 2017. \u201cI know he\u2019s dancing right now,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely happy for what we\u2019ve accomplished and he\u2019s extremely proud of us and who we are as human beings.\u201d Antetokounmpo is hoping to give the Bucks their first NBA title since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led them to the 1971 championship. The Bucks have posted the NBA\u2019s best regular-season record each of the last two years but lost to Miami in a second-round series last season after falling to Toronto in the 2019 Eastern Conference finals. Antetokounmpo says he believes he can win a title in Milwaukee and noted that the Bucks have a \u201cgreat culture.\u201d But he also notes that building a championship team is a step-by-step process. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because at the end of the day, nowhere you go, nowhere you are is a guarantee to win a championship,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cBut I know who I am and I know that I\u2019m a man of my words. It might take me 10 years, I might never win a championship or I might win five. Whatever the case may be, I know who I am, I know what I believe and I know that I stuck with the people who believed in me.\u201d He kept some of them guessing all the way to the end. Antetokounmpo, 26, said he didn\u2019t let any teammates know his decision before announcing it on social media because he didn\u2019t want the news to leak. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said he found out while pulling out of a parking garage when he saw that his sons had texted him the tweet with Antetokounmpo\u2019s announcement. \u201cPlayers like Giannis are very, very rare and very, very unique,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThis commitment from him just means the world to all of us. He believes in the city, he believes in the organization and he believes in his teammates. You just feel like you have a chance to do something special because of his specialness.\u201d Antetokounmpo already has done more for the Bucks then they ever could have imagined when they selected him with the 15th pick in the 2013 draft. The two-time MVP and reigning NBA defensive player of the year believes there\u2019s still more to do. \u201cBeing able to give back to this city and this organization means a lot,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI\u2019ll be ecstatic if we could be able to bring a championship to Milwaukee. I\u2019ll be probably the happiest person ever.\u201d"},{"id":447586,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/billups-battier-going-into-michigan-sports-hall-of-fame","date":"2020-12-17","title":"Billups, Battier going into Michigan Sports Hall of Fame","content":"DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Calvin Johnson, Chauncey Billups, Shane Battier and Jordyn Wieber have been selected for the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, officials said Wednesday.

Asked specifically whether he still wanted to be traded, Harden concentrated energy on the present. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just focused on being here,\u201d Harden said. \u201cToday was good. Yesterday felt really good being out there for the first time since the bubble. I haven\u2019t really had an opportunity to do a lot of five-on-five work. But for my first time being out there, I felt pretty good.\u201d Harden scored 12 points on 3-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes Tuesday with four assists, three rebounds and two steals, generating excitement within the locker room about the potential this season for a Houston Rockets squad featuring the former Kia MVP along with new additions John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Christian Wood. New Rockets coach Stephen Silas said Harden\u2019s debut \u201cmeant a lot,\u201d and added Wednesday that their \u201crelationship continues to build.\u201d Harden reported to Rockets training camp on Dec. 8, but he wasn\u2019t cleared to work out with the rest of the team until Monday, after testing negative for COVID-19 on six consecutive days. Harden missed Houston\u2019s first two exhibition contests against the Chicago Bulls, while he advanced through the league\u2019s coronavirus protocols. Last season\u2019s leading scorer took the floor Tuesday at the Toyota Center with the Rockets starting group. Under contract for the next two seasons at least with a player option in 2022, Harden addressed the media Wednesday for the first time since September, when the Los Angeles Lakers bounced Houston from the playoffs in five games. Harden was asked whether he was trying to send the franchise a message with a trip to Las Vegas, and pictures posted on Instagram of him attending a birthday party in Atlanta for rapper Lil Baby while the rest of his Rockets teammates had already reported to training camp. \u201cI was just training,\u201d he said. Harden also sidestepped the question of whether the rumors of a trade request and uncertainty concerning his future with the organization had created a distraction. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been here, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s been said about it,\u201d said Harden, who mentioned that he hasn\u2019t yet spoken with new general manager Rafael Stone. \u201cEverybody in the locker room and the coaching staff has been focused on ramping up and preparing for the season. So, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Wall said after the game Tuesday night that he hasn\u2019t spoken with Harden specifically about his situation. Cousins echoed that sentiment. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is a business,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cYou can only respect a guy for doing whatever he feels is best for him, his personal life and his career. Honestly, I haven\u2019t [spoken with Harden]. I don\u2019t really feel like that\u2019s my place. That\u2019s a decision he has to make for himself.\u201d When rumors first circulated regarding Harden\u2019s reported desire for a trade, Silas said he wanted to give the star guard \u201csome space,\u201d but expressed confidence he would be \u201call-in\u201d after joining the team for training camp. But it\u2019s clear that Silas continues to tread lightly when discussing Harden\u2019s situation. \u201cI\u2019m just really concentrating on what\u2019s best on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as his buy in with me, it seems pretty good. We\u2019ve talked hoop and talked about different situations. I understand where all these questions are coming from. But I\u2019m gonna keep answering it the same way: I can\u2019t speak for James. I can\u2019t really say what he\u2019s thinking or what he\u2019s not thinking. That was what his media availability was for.\u201d But Harden\u2019s time in front of the microphones Wednesday yielded very little transparency about his intentions. Still, Silas liked what he saw of Harden during his preseason debut, while sounding as if he\u2019d also appreciate more clarity regarding the eight-time All-Star\u2019s commitment to the Houston Rockets as the regular season quickly approaches. \u201cI get the question, but the best thing for me is to really concentrate on how can I maximize his talents on the floor?\u201d Silas said. \u201cHow can I put him in a place where he can be great and help everybody else be great? That kind of simplifies it for me. If I delve into other types of things, it\u2019ll draw away from what\u2019s important, which is how this team is playing. If we exactly knew kind of where his head was at, I think it would be good for everybody. But we\u2019re dealing with reality, which is things change on a day-to-day basis. Things change on a game-to-game basis. As I said before: my job is to coach this basketball team, and make sure the guys are put in the right position. Part of that, as your question is kind of leading to, is the spirit of the group. I think the spirit of the group, especially based on the game last night, is pretty good.\u201d * * * Michael C.

If you don\u2019t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. Either Ferris Bueller or Fennis Dembo said that, we think. With five nights done and four to go, here are five takeaways from what we\u2019ve seen so far in this truncated run-up to the 2020-21 regular season. Not only have we gotten a typical allotment of old faces in new places, a hallmark of NBA training camps annually, we\u2019ve got a considerable sampling of old faces in old places. Taken together, that includes Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in Brooklyn, John Wall and Russell Westbrook switching Wizards for Rockets and vice versa, and Steph Curry working back to prominence for both himself and the Warriors. It was nearly 18 months ago that Durant and Irving rocked NBA free agency by rendezvousing in Brooklyn, but it wasn\u2019t until the Nets\u2019 opener last week that the two hit the floor together. The combination proved electric, seeing both players healthy and creating myriad options and angles for Brooklyn and its new coach Steve Nash. The Nets have to sort out touches and a pecking order, but there\u2019s time for that, and adrenaline to spare. Curry, after playing in only five games last season due to a broken left hand, wasted no time against Sacramento Tuesday. The Warriors sharpshooter scored 29 points in 28 minutes and strained enough at the leash coach Steve Kerr wanted him on to get a few extra minutes. \u201cHe focused on getting himself going,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe was aggressive and looked to score from the outset. He needed it just to find some rhythm, and I think he\u2019s really trending toward being ready for next week.\u201d Wall missed all of last season and, by the time he got back on a court, had been shipped from Washington to Houston. In his debut against Chicago on Friday, the veteran point guard steered clear of the Rockets\u2019 strained relations with star James Harden. But Wall looked healthy, not too rusty and opened up the Rockets\u2019 offense more than in The Beard\u2019s style of iso ball. DeMarcus Cousins, with another fresh start from injury, showed flashes of his old self, too. Some coaches are doing the new-places thing as well, with Stan Van Gundy, Tom Thibodeau and Tyronn Lue back after, er, sabbaticals while Doc Rivers and Billy Donovan barely missed a beat with new jobs. Meanwhile, we\u2019re still waiting on the preseason debuts of players such as LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who are being eased into the preseason the way they figure to be ramped up in the early regular season. With barely two months of turnaround time from the Lakers\u2019 Finals clincher to the team\u2019s tune-up opener, the two all-NBA selections are expected to face Phoenix on Wednesday night. Boston coach Brad Stevens spoke on the day of the Celtics\u2019 preseason opener on Tuesday about the special circumstances facing rookies Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard. \u201cIt\u2019s just every day\u2019s a long class,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey get there an hour before their scheduled time to do the young guys\u2019 workouts. Those guys are both in the gym shooting and working out with their individual coaches before they even get into their lifting and group work. So they are in every which way in a crash course.\u201d That goes for the whole Class of 2020. What used to be at least three months from Draft to summer league to individual work to scrimmages to actual veterans camp got scrunched to less than three weeks by this season\u2019s short turnaround. As hectic as it\u2019s been , though, some rookies have managed to shine. Three in particular made their debuts Tuesday night when the Sixers and Celtics met . Pritchard, the No. 26 pick, scored 16 points with a pair of assists. Nesmith had eight points and five boards. And Tyrese Maxey got his eight points and three rebounds while playing the entire fourth quarter for Philadelphia. \u201cHe knows how to play,\u201d said Rivers, crediting Maxey\u2019s coach at Kentucky, John Calipari, for preparing Wildcat players for the NBA. \u201cYou can\u2019t speed him up. He\u2019s got a plethora of shots. He makes simple plays.\u201d Sacramento\u2019s top pick at No. 12, Tyrese Haliburton shed some jitters and confusion between his debut Friday and his second game Sunday, both at Portland. The 6-foot-5 guard impressed at both ends in Game 2, scoring 11 points with six rebounds, seven assists, a block and a steal in 30 minutes. Said Kings coach Luke Walton: \u201cHe was much more in attack mode tonight than he was the first night, which I said before the game is something that will come with time and experience.\u201d Among the top picks, Charlotte\u2019s LaMelo Ball had the most interesting initial performances. In the Hornets\u2019 opener , Ball had 10 rebounds and four assists but was scoreless. Two nights later against Toronto again, Ball scored 12 points with three boards and two assists, earning a standing ovation from teammates when he drained a 3-pointer for his first points. Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards, the No. 1 pick overall, took until his second performance to reach double figures. As for No. 2 James Wiseman, he might make his debut for Golden State Thursday night or be held out till a scrimmage Saturday in advance of next week\u2019s season opener. Just imagine how things will go when they all learn the play calls. Just five days into the preseason games, the second-year player who has opened the most eyes has been Lakers guard Talen Horton-Tucker. With the 2020 champions balancing the rigors of last postseason against the start of this preseason, the 20-year-old who got a taste of things in the bubble seized some opportunity. Horton-Tucker scored 19 points against the Clippers on Friday and topped that with 33 on Sunday, showing off a variety of scoring moves while grabbing 10 rebounds with four assists and four steals. He immediately mounted a case for minutes consideration even after the Lakers\u2019 deep regular-season rotation kicks in. L.A. did lose some perimeter defense with Rajon Rondo, Danny Green and Avery Bradley missing this season, so that\u2019s a bit of light for Horton-Tucker. \u201cI feel like just coming in with me using my defensive instincts and being able to compete on the defensive end is going to be something that helps me get on the court,\u201d he said. Last season\u2019s Next Big Thing, Zion Williamson, had his opportunities limited last season by management and coaches. Given his propensity for injuries, the Pelicans allowed him to play only in short spurts. That changed on Monday against Miami, when he put up 26 points with 11 rebounds , and he\u2019s looking forward to a relatively normal workload going forward. Several NBA teams kept their powder \u2013 as in, salary cap space \u2013 dry this offseason in anticipation of a more star-studded free agent class in 2021. Except that now, with Giannis Antetokounmpo signing the \u201csuper-max\u201d extension to stay in Milwaukee on Tuesday, more of the luster has come off that crew. In theory, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell and Antetokounmpo would have been taking calls next summer. But all re-upped with their current teams to thin that talent pool. That leaves guys such as Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan and Goran Dragic as free agents or players with options on the 2021-22 season. It might heat up interest in Harden in the coming days, from teams anxious to grab help while they can. The fit of Harden\u2019s personality, work habits and style of play, along with Houston\u2019s asking price, might work just as aggressively against any imminent trade. That could be the conclusion, anyway, of some players, coaches and front offices when all is said and done. The opposite of feeling rushed is the dragged out schedule of traditional NBA preseasons, with more practices, more games, more time ticking slowly until the real deal begins. This is the third time in the past 22 years that the league has had to quicken its preseason pace \u2014 counting the 1998 and 2011 labor lockouts \u2013 and there was a taste after those first two to tackle camp and tune-up games in a more concentrated way. Remove the virus as a factor next fall (fingers crossed) and the lessons learned this time about tighter preparation could shorten the grind for everyone. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Harden scored 12 points on 3-for-10 shooting in 21 minutes with four assists, three rebounds and two steals, as first-year head coach Stephen Silas finally caught the first glimpse of his full squad in a 112-98 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. \u201cIt meant a lot,\u201d Silas said. \u201cYou kind of have to ask those guys, but it seemed like the camaraderie was pretty good, and to have a talented player out there on the floor doesn\u2019t hurt anybody. It\u2019s an adjustment for some guys, but the more talent you have in the NBA, the more games you can win, really. So, it was good. \u201cThe detail part of it,\u201d Silas continues, \u201cguys learning how they\u2019re gonna be able to play together and with each other is something that\u2019s gonna be a work in progress and something we\u2019re just gonna have to watch a lot of film and really figure out the best combinations, figure out where guys need the basketball, and making sure that everybody\u2019s included in what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s gonna be a task that we have. We don\u2019t have a long time to kind of figure it all out, but we\u2019ve got to get to the details.\u201d Silas admitted to not having enough experience with Harden to know whether the star guard was rusty in his exhibition debut, and the coach couldn\u2019t gauge how close the former MVP is to achieving regular-season form. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve played against him so many times over the last countless amount of years,\u201d Silas said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t answer that question. I don\u2019t know how close he is. I haven\u2019t been around him enough to know the answer.\u201d Harden reported to Rockets training camp on Dec. 8, but he wasn\u2019t cleared to work out with the team until Monday, after testing negative for COVID-19 on six consecutive days. Harden missed Houston\u2019s first two exhibition outings against the Chicago Bulls, as did P.J. Tucker and Sterling Brown, who also made their preseason debuts against the Spurs. Still, Silas wasted no time inserting Harden and Tucker in the starting lineup. Silas initially said before the game that he planned to play both approximately 20 minutes, while limiting Brown to somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 minutes. Harden and Tucker played 21 minutes apiece, while Brown stayed on the floor for 24 minutes. \u201cHe was good,\u201d Silas said of Harden. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a great player and [he] can do so many things on the floor on and off the ball. Defensively, he has good hands and makes plays, and is smart. So, to have him out there was great.\u201d Harden and Tucker quickly made the most of their brief time. Harden nailed a step-back 3-pointer on his first attempt of the night, then drew a foul launching another shot from deep on Houston\u2019s next trip down the court. Harden would knock down all three free throws to push his total to six points less than three minutes into the game. Tucker, meanwhile, splashed his first attempt on a corner 3-pointer even before that, and finished the night with 8 points a rebound and an assist, while Brown contributed 2 points, 6 rebounds and a pair of steals. \u201cIt felt great to be out there with those guys again,\u201d guard Ben McLemore said. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to have a full team and your guys to go out there and compete with. We\u2019re all excited to have everybody back.\u201d Although Harden and Tucker played sparingly, their exhibition debuts at least temporarily lifted some of the dark clouds hanging over the organization in recent weeks. Harden has reportedly requested a trade, while Tucker \u2014 in the final year of his contract \u2014 has expressed disappointment about the team not extending an extension offer. Traded to Houston for Russell Westbrook and a first-round pick on Dec. 2, new point guard John Wall played the team\u2019s first two preseason games with the ball primarily in his hands. Wall admitted the return of Harden changed that dynamic somewhat, but also provided optimism about what the Rockets might be able to do this season offensively. Silas pointed out \u201cit can be really good to have two dynamic ballhandlers on the floor.\u201d Wall finished with 15 points and three assists in his first game alongside Harden. \u201cAt first it was a little different for me because I\u2019m so used to having the ball,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBut we were just talking throughout the game, and just talking on the sidelines. At times, if he got the ball, I could find ways to run out and get outlet passes from him, and at times still let him be aggressive. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m not worried about trying to score 30 or 40. My job is to try to be the point guard, be the leader out there, try to get guys shots, and also be aggressive for myself to open up the floor for the offense. At the same time, we know who you are being James Harden and being an elite scorer in this league. So, play your game no matter what.\u2019\u201d Harden wasn\u2019t made available to the media after Tuesday\u2019s debut, and Wall said that he isn\u2019t trying to dissuade his new teammate in his efforts to move on to a new team. \u201cI\u2019ve been cool with James before we even became teammates [and] never thought this idea would even come of us being on the same team,\u201d Wall said. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s gonna do what\u2019s best for him, and the organization is gonna do what\u2019s best for them also. So, the most important thing is when we step on that floor we\u2019re focusing ourselves on basketball. I don\u2019t try to ask him about that because that\u2019s his personal business. All I worry about is what we can do to make this Rockets team the best it can be while everybody\u2019s here and move forward with that.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Antetokounmpo\u2019s decision to ride with the organization and the city by signing a reported five-year, $228 million \u201csuper-max\u201d contract extension answers one of the biggest basketball questions hanging over the NBA as it begins this uniquely challenging season. For Antetokounmpo and his family, certainly, this is a wonderful step into the effervescent, versatile player\u2019s prime. He has stability, he has assurances, he has a franchise that will continue to be nipped and tucked around him like a tailored suit, all in a place and with the company and fan base with whom he grew from teenaged lad to beloved icon. The math of this contract matters in length and size. First, if he and the Bucks see it through, it will keep Antetokounmpo on board for 13 seasons. That\u2019s more than double what Kareem Abdul-Jabbar spent in Milwaukee, longer than Michael Jordan toiled in Chicago or LeBron James spent in two stints in Cleveland. That puts an athlete on a level where, never mind a statue outside the arena, he gets streets and babies named after him. And he\u2019ll be just 32 by that point, presumably with lots of NBA tread on his tires. Clearly, it\u2019s a financial boon for Giannis, his girlfriend Mariah and son Liam. Given that Antetokounmpo already will have earned, by the time the extension begins, approximately $108.6 million in basketball salary alone (counting his $27.5 million salary for 2020-21) it\u2019s silly to refer to the additional $228 million as \u201cgenerational wealth.\u201d So let\u2019s just say that Liam and any siblings probably won\u2019t have to worry about their great-great grandkids. There should be corks popping, too, in the background of any Zoom or FaceTime hookups involving Milwaukee\u2019s coaches and players such as Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and the rest. This move brings validation and opportunity, enabling current and future teammates to make some of their career and life decisions knowing that Antetokounmpo in all likelihood will be around at least to 2025 (when there reportedly is an \u201copt out\u201d window in his contract.) Five full seasons from this point is an eternity by sports standards, by life\u2019s standards in 2020, providing time and assurances from which real confidence can bloom. Granted, there is an imperative for them all to show they\u2019re up to the task, that the teammates are capable, the coaching is savvy and the front office is more about the Jrue Holiday move than the Bogdan Bogdanovic mishap. The cupboard is pretty bare, as far as draft picks, so it\u2019s going to be on Giannis and his veteran friends to get the Bucks where they want to go. The record of previous \u201csuper-max\u201d signees (Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall) is mixed so far. So there\u2019s still a clock ticking. It just sounds less now like a drum pounding. Today\u2019s news also represents a pretty nice development for the NBA. For all the ways in which the league demonstrates time and again how smart and forward-thinking it is \u2013 pulling off the coronavirus \u201cbubble\u201d restart in Orlando, cultivating a true sense of partnership between players and employers in tackling tough issues \u2013 there is one problem neither side has solved: the drift of top talent to a handful of glamour markets. Antetokounmpo heading to Los Angeles, New York, Miami or Golden State would have been a predictable outcome. An old-millennium storyline, frankly, we\u2019ve seen play out over and over and over. There\u2019s something fresh and optimistic about his re-upping with the Bucks, offering hope to teams and fans in the flyover markets. Any ring that Antetokounmpo manages to win in Milwaukee will be worth exponentially more by building and working toward it there than if he were to relocate somewhere the trophy case is full. It\u2019s something of a nod to the NFL\u2019s ability to keep a sure-fire Hall of Fame quarterback (and Bucks minority owner) like Aaron Rodgers in the hinterlands of Green Bay for his entire career. Now if only teams such as the Timberwolves, Grizzlies, Pacers and Pelicans can maintain the same sort of superstar hopes the Bills, Chiefs, Colts and Saints enjoy. If the absence of bad news counts as good, there is a whole \u2018nother level of wonderfulness to Antetokounmpo\u2019s decision. The alternative to his simple pen stroke was going to be dreary, triggering rampant speculation next week, with countless rumors weighing on the mood and skipping right over the 72 games and postseason of 2020-21. Conjecture over players already under contract brings out some of the worst we see in fans and media, not to mention the players themselves. Anthony Davis got himself a ring with the Lakers, but will spend a lot longer living down his rude exit from New Orleans. James Harden appears to be headed down that same path. Antetokounmpo was starting to get a little weary of the topic himself. In his first Zoom availability of the preseason last week, he tried and mostly failed to explain the delay in reaching his decision \u2013 the years and dollars weren\u2019t going to change, after all. He wrapped up by suggesting the topic be off-limits in subsequent sessions. Fat chance. Now? All arrows are trending in the right direction for the Bucks. Hungry teams in flashier markets can line up their next big quarry. The Greek Freak and his mates have winning to do. Ol\u2019 shot-and-a-beer Milwaukee got a little more glamorous \u2013 and peaceful and focused \u2013 with Tuesday\u2019s news. Folks there are entitled to enjoy it. One trophy down, one to go. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Bucks announced later in the day that Antetokounmpo had signed an extension without announcing the terms or length. The 26-year-old Antetokounmpo had until Monday to sign the Bucks\u2019 supermax extension offer. If he turned it down, Antetokounmpo could have become a free agent after the upcoming season. The Athletic and Stadium reported that he agreed to a five-year contract worth $228 million that includes an opt-out clause in 2025. \u201cThis is my home, this is my city,\u201d Antetokounmpo said in his post on social media. \u201cI\u2019m blessed to be able to be a part of the Milwaukee Bucks for the next 5 years. Let\u2019s make these years count. The show goes on, let\u2019s get it.\u201d Bucks co-owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan said in a statement that \u201cGiannis is a once in a generation player and we are beyond excited for him to remain with the Bucks.\u201d \u201cThis is a big moment for me and my family and I want to thank the Bucks organization for believing in us,\u201d Antetokounmo said in a statement released by the team. \u201cYou took a chance on us eight years ago and now putting my signature on a contract like this is unreal \u2013 but it\u2019s all because of hard work. This is my home and I\u2019m going to continue working hard and do my best to make the Bucks, our fans and the city proud.\u201d His decision means the Bucks will hang on to their biggest star since Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who led Milwaukee to its lone NBA title in 1971, but demanded a trade and was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1975. The Bucks paid a hefty price to revamp their roster this offseason in an attempt to persuade Antetokounmpo to stay. They dealt away guards Eric Bledsoe and George Hill, first-round draft pick R.J. Hampton and two more first-round selections as part of a package to acquire Jrue Holiday. They also overhauled their bench by adding Bobby Portis, D.J. Augustin, Torrey Craig and Bryn Forbes. Antetokounmpo called those offseason moves \u201camazing\u201d without indicating whether he planned to sign the extension. \u201cAt the end of the day, the team is going to take care of what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Antetokounmpo said last week. \u201cOff the court, they tried to improve this team as much as possible. We\u2019ve had the best regular-season team the last two years and that shows you that the team and the front office cares about improving the team every single year. Me, on the court, I\u2019m going to try to improve individually and help my teammates improve, also.\u201d Despite that regular-season success, the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks have yet to reach the NBA Finals. Milwaukee lost a second-round series in five games to Miami last season, with Antetokounmpo missing most of Game 4 and all of Game 5 with a sprained right ankle. In 2019, the Bucks reached the Eastern Conference finals and took a 2-0 lead over eventual NBA champion Toronto before dropping four straight. The Bucks understood the importance of Antetokounmpo\u2019s decision to the future of the franchise. When Antetokounmpo celebrated his birthday on Dec. 6, each of his teammates jokingly gave him a pen as a present in hopes he\u2019d use one to sign his extension. After Antetokounmpo announced his decision, All-Star forward Khris Middleton tweeted to Bucks teammate Pat Connaughton: \u201cI hope he uses the pens we all gave him!!\u201d Milwaukee selected Antetokounmpo out of Greece with the 15th overall pick in the 2013 draft. The 6-foot-11 \u201cGreek Freak\u201d has career averages of 20.1 points, 8.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game. Last season, he averaged 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists while winning his second straight MVP award. He also was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. \u201cHis work ethic and desire to be the best epitomize what the Bucks stand for and what our future holds,\u201d the Bucks co-owners said in their statement. \u201cWe thank Giannis and his family for their long-term commitment to Milwaukee and we look forward to many years of success.

While three stars are preferred among championship contenders, two is the norm, and nobody can compare with the Lakers\u2019 pair if only because, well, they\u2019re coming off a championship. Besides that, LeBron is an all-time great who just finished second in the Kia MVP vote at age 35, while Davis made All-NBA and impacts both rims. Therefore, until proven otherwise, LeBron and Davis are the gold standard. Their success is rooted in talent but also compatibility. Place them together on the floor and all the boxes are checked: Shooting, passing, rim protection, half-court play, fast-break, intimidation and presence. Their personalities and egos coexist. More often than not, they come through in close games that call for a big shot or big play. Maybe the best advantage: With LeBron and Davis, the Lakers don\u2019t have a desperate need for a third star and can surround them with low-cost role players who enjoy open shots and other fringe benefits that make them better than they are. Here are five other duos hoping to replicate LeBron and Davis in some manner, hoping for a big payoff in the postseason, but facing some questions and issues along the way: Well, that first impression was a bit slippery, wasn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s supply some context: There was no ill-will or a lack of chemistry between Kawhi and George; that\u2019s not why the opening chapter of this anticipated pairing fell flat last season. Rather, they separated themselves from the team based on reports of favoritism, to the extent it alienated their teammates and caused some friction. The Athletic reported Kawhi was often late to team flights because he sometimes commuted from his home in San Diego. Also, the two players dictated whether the Clippers would practice or not. And then former coach Doc Rivers recently suggested that holdover players from the previous season never warmed up to George. It\u2019s typical for stars to get special treatment yet in this case it backfired, and even Kawhi is admitting as much. He made a point recently to stress the importance of both players being healthy and available from the start; their tendency to play the load management card, especially Kawhi, also didn\u2019t sit well with teammates last season. Ultimately, success is about wins, and both players came up weak in the moment of truth, when the Clippers blew a 3-1 playoff series lead to Denver. Plus, the Clippers just made a massive commitment to George with that four-year, $190 million contract extension; Kawhi is expected to sign one as well, but hasn\u2019t yet, and free agency is approaching next summer. Their two-way skills are complimentary, their personalities don\u2019t conflict and they share the ball. As a pair of athletic wings who impact games in multiple ways, Kawhi and George are a good on-court fit. But the price for them, both in salary and the assets it took to bring them to LA, was and is steep. Sure, their one season together is a small sample size, yet when is the payoff coming, if ever? It isn\u2019t often when the Suns make a personnel move that gets almost universal applause, but this was an exception. Paul feels so right for Booker in so many ways, and the only shame is this union didn\u2019t happen sooner; if so, Booker would have multiple playoff appearances right now, instead of zero. Not only is Paul a proper mentor \u2014 you saw what he did with a young group in in Oklahoma City last season especially with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 but he also completely frees Booker from playmaking duties, allowing the young shooter to roam and do what he does best. This very well could be a First-Team All-NBA season for Booker, and if so, Paul will have a hand in making that happen. Obviously, the bigger question is what this does for the Suns, who ran the table in the Orlando bubble, nearly made the playoffs and finished strong under new coach Monty Williams. Let\u2019s just say the backcourt will be the least of their worries. Hopefully for Phoenix, this helps Deandre Ayton develop into a solid pick-and-roll player and enhances his value and impact. If Paul and Booker manage to gel, the ripple effect on the club could be substantial. The unveiling is finally upon the Nets and the possibilities should be glorious. After a one-year wait while both players recovered from injuries, the Nets get to reap the benefits of a pair of championship-tested stars still in their prime and prepared to make strong comebacks. From purely a talent standpoint, there\u2019s no question Durant and Irving place Brooklyn in contention for the East title and maybe NBA title. Durant and Irving have the skills to elevate teams to the next level by themselves. Together? Well, they can tag-team opponents into the ground, since both can create plays for themselves and others, and also take turns being the hero in tight finishes. Irving\u2019s tricky ball-handling and Durant\u2019s shooting are top-shelf in the NBA. The only unseen evil is ego. Both players are quirky and Irving is off the charts. Remember, he\u2019d had enough of being teammates with LeBron James; that alone tells you he\u2019s \u2026 different. At least Durant willingly joined Steph Curry and the Warriors for a few years when he could\u2019ve gone anywhere. Durant seems the least threatened of the two. He and Irving plotted to make this happen, so give them the benefit of the doubt regarding compatibility. But now it\u2019s time to show it. This is a basketball shotgun marriage made possible because the Rockets didn\u2019t want Westbrook anymore and the Wizards weren\u2019t willing to gamble on John Wall\u2019s recovery. So now we have a former Kia MVP who needs an image cleansing and a 30-point scorer who needs the respect he craves. Maybe this will work out and get both Westbrook and Beal what they\u2019re looking for. After a fallout with Kevin Durant and failing to get anywhere special in short stints alongside Paul George and James Harden, Russ is desperate to find a co-star who clicks. He\u2019s running out of options and time, so he\u2019ll likely do whatever it takes to appease Beal. The best way is by becoming a facilitator because Westbrook\u2019s shooting is vaporizing anyway. Westbrook can compete for the NBA assists lead if he looks to connect regularly with Beal, one of the game\u2019s premier shooters. Beal wasn\u2019t always on the best basketball terms with Wall, so this is his chance to make things right, too, with his co-star. Beal didn\u2019t make All-NBA last season despite posting big numbers and it was a sledgehammer to the ego. The best way to change that is by winning, and the Wizards will be in position to do so if this duo meshes early and often. The classic big man\/passer combination gets yet another chance to fulfill expectations, this time with a new coach and fresh approach. The Sixers are putting their faith and future into these two by investing financially and resisting any urge to break them up. And that\u2019s probably for the better, since Embiid and Simmons haven\u2019t even reached their primes yet. The trick is getting them to hide their weaknesses and maximize their strengths under Doc Rivers. Can Embiid scale down his tendency to drift to the perimeter and shoot 3s? Can Simmons develop a trusty mid-range game by working with assistant coach Sam Cassell? If so, the Sixers will flourish because Embiid and Simmons, from a skill-set and personality standpoint, are players who don\u2019t clash or get in each other\u2019s way. Now it\u2019s up to new GM Daryl Morey to find the right pieces to place around them. The two-star foundation is there and intact; what the Sixers are waiting for are better results in the playoffs. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Boston Celtics are perhaps the most storied team in the NBA thanks to their 17 NBA titles, countless Hall of Fame players and the legendary NBA moments they have been a part of.

The Celtics unveiled their new uniforms, which are very similar to the NBA championship banners that hang above TD Garden. The Nets unveiled their Classic Edition uniform, which honors a fan-favorite \u201ctie-dye\u201d design worn during the 1990-91 season.

Harden and P.J. Tucker arrived at Rockets training camp late and had to advance through the league\u2019s coronavirus testing protocols before they were cleared to return to the team. \u201cThey were both at practice today and participated and were very good,\u201d Silas said. \u201cIt was good to have them there, good to have their spirit there, good to have their veteran savvy, their smarts, their ability in so many different things that it was good to have. They were both here.\u201d Harden reportedly requested a trade recently, while Tucker has sought a contract extension, according to reports, as the 35-year-old enters the final year of a four-year contract signed during the 2017-18 season. Silas said he spoke briefly with Harden on Monday and declined to answer whether the star guard was fully committed to the Rockets moving forward. \u201cWe had a good conversation, and I\u2019m just gonna leave it at that,\u201d Silas said. \u201cYou can ask him about his commitment and all that sort of thing. We had a good conversation. He was locked in. He was asking good questions. He was bringing up good points. We had a good discussion. So, that\u2019s it. We talked basketball. I\u2019m a basketball coach, and he\u2019s a basketball player. We talked hoop today. \u201cSo as far as his commitment to what we\u2019re doing basketball-wise, he was right there. As far as the rumors and all the other stuff, I can\u2019t speak to. Again, that\u2019s a question that you\u2019ll have to have for him. As far as a distraction, [it] really hasn\u2019t been that much of a distraction. It\u2019s been something that the media has been talking about quite a bit, and I\u2019ve had to answer a lot of questions. But as far as our growth, and our kind of pushing forward this season, we\u2019ve kind of been right on pace. Adding him and P.J. to the mix just makes it better. So, I see it as a positive.\u201d Both Harden and Tucker participated fully in Monday\u2019s workout at the Toyota Center, and Silas expects both to play Tuesday when the Rockets host the Spurs for their third exhibition outing. Because of Houston\u2019s recent schedule featuring back-to-back games against the Chicago Bulls, Silas said the Rockets are \u201cramping [Harden] up just because of the circumstance,\u201d adding \u201che\u2019ll play tomorrow, and we\u2019ll figure out the minutes tomorrow.\u201d After practice, Tucker said there were \u201cmultiple reasons\u201d why he was late to training camp and he explained his reported desire for a contract extension. \u201cIt\u2019s not even just getting a contract extension,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the total goal. The goal is to be in a place where you\u2019re wanted, where you want to be, who wants you. I think that\u2019s what every player wants. Nobody wants to be somewhere that [doesn\u2019t] want them. There\u2019s a certain way to show that, and it\u2019s not just contract extensions.\u201d *** Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Despite the post-championship departure of Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors remained near the top of the league with an elite defense and cohesion among a capable and experienced top seven. But when things got tight against the Boston Celtics, they just didn\u2019t have the offense to get over the hump. The 100.3 points per 100 possessions they scored in the conference semis was the worst mark for a team in a 2020 playoff series. Pascal Siakam struggled in the bubble and averaged just 14.9 points on an effective field goal percentage of 40% over the seven games. What\u2019s new? Two more pieces of the Raptors\u2019 championship rotation have taken their talents to L.A. The departures of Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka leave a hole a center that Aron Baynes (along with more minutes from Chris Boucher) will attempt to fill. The Raptors also have a new (and temporary) home, set to play games at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. until pandemic restrictions are lifted. What\u2019s missing: Even if Siakam rebounds from his sub-par bubble performance, he needs to take things to another level if the Raptors are going to improve offensively. They\u2019re strong in transition, play cohesively, and were the only team that ranked in the top six in both 3-point percentage (37.4%, fifth) and the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range (42.1%, sixth) last season. But they lack the go-to guy that can get to his spot whenever needed. Even before the season restart, Siakam saw a drop in efficiency with his increase in usage rate. Kyle Lowry | 19.4 ppg, 7.5 apg, 1.4 spg The 34 year old ranked fourth in minutes per game (36.2) last season. In the last year of his contract. Fred VanVleet | 17.6 ppg, 6.6 apg, 1.9 spg Led the league with 4.2 deflections per game. Back with a new and lucrative four-year deal. OG Anunoby | 10.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 1.4 spg Saw a big jump in 3-point percentage (from 33.2% to 39.0%) last season. Still just 23 years old. Pascal Siakam | 22.9 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 3.5 apg One of the league\u2019s best two-way players. Salary jumps from $2.3 last season to $28.8 million this season. Aron Baynes | 11.5 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 1.6 apg Had a great start to last season and made nine 3s in a game, but played in only 42 of the Suns\u2019 73. Chris Boucher | 6.6 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.0 bpg Intriguing two-way talent (he can shoot 3s and block shots) should have a more consistent role. Patrick McCaw | 4.6 ppg, 2.1 apg, 1.1 spg Low-usage player on offense, but still a key piece that the Raptors were missing in the bubble. Norman Powell | 16.0 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 1.2 spg Made the most of an expanded role last season. One of the league\u2019s best in transition. Toronto Raptors, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions Season Prediction:  The Raptors could certainly remain at or near the top of the Eastern Conference. The defense should remain one of the league\u2019s most disruptive units, and the continued development of both Siakam and Anunoby offers some hope for an offense that took a step backward last season. Of course, the top of the East promises to be more crowded this year, Lowry turns 35 in March, and the departures of Gasol and Ibaka could put a small dent in the all-important cohesion that has fueled the Raptors\u2019 success on both ends of the floor.

They were one of the last three teams standing and they were dealing with injuries to Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward. But it was still a disappointing finish for the Cs, who were the higher seed and the only East team that finished in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. The Celtics took a step forward despite losing five rotation players in the summer of 2019, but they came up just short once again, losing in the conference finals for the third time in the last four years. What\u2019s new? Hayward is in Charlotte after opting out of the final year of his contract. The Celtics were unable to work out a sign-and-trade deal that brought back any players, but they do now have a large trade exception, and Hayward\u2019s departure did allow them to use the full mid-level exception to sign center Tristan Thompson. More important may be that Jayson Tatum put pen to paper on an extension that will keep him under contract through (at least) the 2024-25 season. What\u2019s missing: Depth. Hayward played in only five of their 17 playoff games and the Celtics still have four quality perimeter players. But the somewhat surprising departure of a guy who averaged 17.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists last season leaves the team significantly thinner at the forward positions and more susceptible to absences within that first-line group of Walker, Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart. With Walker still dealing with a knee issue, the Celtics could also be depending on 32-year-old Jeff Teague more than they should. Kemba Walker | 20.4 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 4.8 apg Lingering left knee issue is a concern and will keep him off the floor to start the season. Marcus Smart | 12.9 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 4.9 apg The man who makes \u201cwinning plays\u201d became more aggressive offensively last season. Jaylen Brown | 20.3 ppg 6.4 rpg, 2.1 apg Not able to create his own offense like Walker or Tatum, but he does everything else. Jayson Tatum | 23.4 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 3.0 apg Made a huge scoring leap last season and showed signs of playmaking improvement in the playoffs. Daniel Theis | 9.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.3 bpg Had issues against Miami, but still an important, complementary screen-setter and defender. Semi Ojeleye | 3.4 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 0.5 apg Played just four minutes over the last four playoff games, but back in a key role with Hayward gone. Jeff Teague | 10.9 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 5.2 apg Has a ton of playoff experience, but has been hidden on bad teams for the last two years. Tristan Thompson | 12.0 ppg, 10.1 rpg, 2.1 apg Will have to flip a switch after playing for the league\u2019s worst defense of the last two seasons. Grant Williams | 3.4 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 1.0 apg Had some moments in limited minutes in the playoffs and should see a larger role this year. Boston Celtics, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Celtics still have the pieces to rank in the top five on either end of the floor and finish in the top four in the conference for a fifth straight season. And come July, they could certainly be the team representing the East in The Finals, especially if the progress of Tatum and Brown continues at its current pace. But with no Hayward and with Walker\u2019s health a question before the season even starts, they\u2019re a little more fragile than they were last season, when they were able to withstand a myriad of absences within their top six.

Caris LeVert had some sensational moments and Jarrett Allen took a big step forward offensively, but what was the league\u2019s eighth-ranked defense prior to the hiatus fell apart with several rotation players missing. The 122.9 points per 100 possessions the Nets allowed Toronto to score in the first round was the third highest mark for a team in any playoff series in the last 10 years (and 22.6 more than the Raptors scored in the conference semifinals). What \u2019 s new? All of the above doesn\u2019t really matter, because Kevin Durant is ready to make his Nets debut, recovered from the Achilles tear he suffered in the 2019 Finals. Kyrie Irving, who played just 20 games last season, is also back to run the point. To make things even more interesting, the Nets hired first time coach Steve Nash to bring it all together, and his staff includes Mike D\u2019Antoni and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire. With Durant and Irving under contract for just two more seasons, higher expectations come with a sense of urgency. What \u2019 s missing: In a shortened season, the Nets don\u2019t have a lot of time to figure out who and how good they are. Because Durant changes everything and because we\u2019ve never seen this group together, it\u2019s difficult to know if or how the Nets might need to retool between now and the trade deadline. All eyes will be on Durant when the season starts, but questions will center on how LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie, who both seemingly need the ball in their hands, function around the two stars. Even if they fit well, there will be trade chatter. Kyrie Irving | 27.4 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 6.4 apg Had two 50-point games in the 20 he played prior to right shoulder surgery in March. Caris LeVert | 18.7 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 4.4 apg Has a lot in his off-the-dribble bag, but just 30% on catch-and-shoot 3s over the last two years. Joe Harris | 14.5 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 2.1 apg 44% from 3-point range (second among players with 500+ attempts) over the last three seasons. Kevin Durant | 26.0 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 5.9 apg (2018-19) His 55.1% in \u201918-19 was the best mid-range shooting season (minimum 100 attempts) in 20+ years. DeAndre Jordan | 8.3 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 0.9 bpg Remains an elite rebounder at 32. His 16.4 boards per 36 minutes ranked second in the league. Jarrett Allen | 11.1 ppg, 9.6 rpg, 1.3 bpg May not start, but should play more than Jordan. Made some nice, short-roll plays in the bubble. Spencer Dinwiddie | 20.6 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 6.8 apg One of the best in the league at getting to the basket and to the line off the dribble. Jeff Green | 9.4 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 1.0 apg The Nets are his ninth team in the last seven seasons. Could be used as a small-ball center. Landry Shamet | 9.3 ppg, 1.9 rpg, 1.9 apg Terrific shooter (40% from 3-point range in his two seasons), but doesn\u2019t offer much else. Brooklyn Nets, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Nets are obviously one of the most difficult teams in the league to forecast. They have one of the three best players in the league, an offensive force that no defender can match up with. But it\u2019s been 18 months since he last played, and he\u2019s coming back from one of the most devastating injuries in sports. If Durant is 90% of his old self, the ceiling is very high and the Nets\u2019 ability to contend for a championship will come down to chemistry and defense. We\u2019ll be able to measure the defensive disposition early, but it may take some time for this team to really hit its stride.

They saw a win increase in a shortened season, but they had a low bar (the league\u2019s worst record in 2018-19) in that regard and they were one of eight teams that failed to qualify for the league\u2019s restart in Orlando. Mitchell Robinson showed flashes of being a two-way force inside and small steps were taken on both ends of the floor, but the veterans the Knicks brought in (on short contracts) last year didn\u2019t really move the needle. The ultimate result was the latest in what feels like an endless cycle of restarts. What \u2019 s new? The major changes have occurred in leadership. Former agent Leon Rose has taken over the front office and veteran coach Tom Thibodeau is now running things on the floor. The Knicks brought in a few more low-cost free agents and Obi Toppin is the latest lottery pick that they hope will stick. But if there\u2019s going to be real improvement or even just a sign of promise, it will have to come from within. What \u2019 s missing: The Knicks have some bigs that can finish at the rim, but they lack shot creation on the perimeter unless RJ Barrett (last year\u2019s No. 3 pick) takes a big step forward. And while Thibodeau has a reputation for being a defensive coach, he couldn\u2019t pull the Timberwolves out of the bottom 10 on that end of the floor in his 2 1\/2 seasons in Minnesota and he doesn\u2019t seem to have the personnel to keep the Knicks from being a worse-than-average defensive team for the 17th time in the last 18 years. Elfrid Payton | 10.0 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 7.2 apg Caretaker at the point until the Knicks can find a serious upgrade. Kept the offense afloat last season. Alec Burks | 15.0 pts, 4.3 reb, 2.9 ast Known more for attacking the basket, but has become a sold 3-point shooter (38.5% last season). RJ Barrett | 14.3 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.6 apg Rough, off-the-dribble shooting numbers as a rookie, but showed a knack for getting to the line. Julius Randle | 19.5 pts, 9.7 reb, 3.1 ast Saw a big drop in efficiency last season with a lower free throw rate and poor shooting from the outside. Nerlens Noel | 7.4 pts, 4.9 reb, 1.5 blk His 4.79 steals + blocks per 36 minutes was the league\u2019s second highest mark (min. 750+ minutes played) Reggie Bullock | 8.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 1.4 ast Will be 19 months removed from back surgery when the season begins. Austin Rivers | 8.8 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 1.7 apg Scored 41 points in a game last season. Scored 3 (on 1-for-9 shooting) a few nights later. Mitchell Robinson | 9.7 pts, 7.0 rpg, 2.0 blk The talent is there. Added consistency and focus would make him a keeper. Obi Toppin | 20.0 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 2.2 apg (Dayton) The college player of the year should be ready to contribute offensively. Defense could be an issue New York Knicks, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions It\u2019s difficult to envision the Knicks ending the Eastern Conference\u2019s longest active playoff drought (seven seasons and counting), though the new play-in scenario offers more hope than usual. More important than the results is the establishment of an environment in which young players can develop. Because that kind of structure has been absent, we don\u2019t know yet if Barrett or Robinson are future franchise cornerstones or future journeymen, or if the Knicks should cut bait on Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina and Dennis Smith Jr. But the next six months are an opportunity to push those players further, while establishing the Knicks as a competent organization from top to bottom. They only have to look across the East River to find a franchise that rose from a worse position to one which established stars wanted to join.

Playing without Ben Simmons (who suffered a left knee injury in the seeding games), they struggled on both ends of the floor. They shot a postseason-worst 26% from 3-point range and ranked in the bottom three in both opponent turnover rate and opponent free throw rate. After a year in which they were one possession away from the conference finals, it was a big step backward for a team with two of the best young talents in the league. While the quick exit could be blamed on Simmons\u2019 absence, the Sixers hadn\u2019t been playing to their potential while he was healthy, seemingly having spent money in the wrong places in the summer of 2019. What\u2019s new? Changes were inevitable and they came swiftly. Head coach Brett Brown was fired and eventually replaced by Doc Rivers, just three days after he parted ways with the LA Clippers. A month later, the Sixers hired Daryl Morey as their new president of basketball operations (shortly after he left Houston), placing him above GM Elton Brand in the decision-making hierarchy. Morey got to work quickly, trading Al Horford and Josh Richardson in deals that brought back Danny Green and Seth Curry. Rivers, meanwhile, has promised to run more pick-and-rolls in the Sixers\u2019 offense. What\u2019s missing: Most important was adding shooting around Simmons and Joel Embiid, which is what Curry and Green bring. But neither is much of a threat off the dribble and the Sixers still lack an offensive triple threat who can create advantages in the half-court offense. Simmons\u2019 inability (or unwillingness) to shoot and need to operate in the paint has too often had Embiid catching the ball on the perimeter, and that \u201cfit\u201d issue remains. Dwight Howard as the back-up center also limits the Sixers\u2019 ability to surround Simmons with shooting when Embiid sits. Ben Simmons | 16.4 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 8.0 apg A force in transition. Ranked third with 226 assists on 3-pointers. Arguably the league\u2019s best perimeter defender. Seth Curry | 12.4 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 1.9 apg His 45.1% from 3-point range over the last three seasons is the league\u2019s best mark over that stretch. Danny Green | 8.0 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 1.3 spg Numbers took a step backward last season, but he always shoots better in seasons ending with an odd number. Tobias Harris | 19.6 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 3.2 apg Was at his best (20.3 ppg on 55.4% effective FG%) with the Clippers, playing the four for Rivers. Joel Embiid | 23.0 ppg, 11.6 rpg, 3.0 apg Took more shots from outside the paint (effective field goal percentage of 44%) than in the paint (59%) last season. Dwight Howard | 7.5 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 1.1 bpg Remains an elite finisher (79% in the restricted area) and rebounder (eighth in rebounding percentage). Shake Milton | 9.4 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 2.6 apg Surprise contributor in his second season, but the offense wasn\u2019t good when he played with Simmons. Mike Scott | 6.0 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 0.8 apg Gives the Sixers a floor-spacing option at the five. 39.1% from 3 over the last three seasons. Matisse Thybulle | 4.7 ppg, 1.6 rpg, 1.4 spg An elite defender (ranked second with 2.6 steals per 36 minutes), but needs work offensively. Philadelphia 76ers, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions With Simmons (now 24) and Embiid (turning 27 in March), the ceiling is high and it wouldn\u2019t be a total shock to see the Sixers representing the Eastern Conference in The Finals. This is a team that, despite its issues last season, had some impressive wins (at home) over the best teams in the league. Just a healthy and in-shape Embiid who operates in the paint more than he does outside would make this a better team than it was last season. But there are a handful of contenders at the top of the East and most of them don\u2019t have as many questions about fit, chemistry and consistency. Seeing how the personnel and coaching changes manifest themselves on the floor will make the Sixers a fascinating team to watch once again.

A great movie, but a dreary ending. Pick your own metaphor for the fact that the Bucks can\u2019t look back too happily on last season \u2014 or the season before that \u2014 without running smack into how poorly things ended. In 2019, it was a magical regular season and 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals before fizzling in four straight losses to Toronto. This time, another stellar pre-bubble campaign got lost with Milwaukee\u2019s mojo somewhere during the virus shutdown. The Bucks went 8-10 in Orlando, including their ouster in five by Miami in the conference semis. There\u2019s a \u201cchampionship or bust\u201d cloud in 2020-21 over these guys What \u2019 s new? GM Jon Horst seemed to have pulled off two master strokes in the same 24-hour period when news broke early that he had a) traded for New Orleans guard Jrue Holiday and b) signed-and-traded for Sacramento wing Bogdan Bogdanovic. Then the Bogdanovic deal unraveled with some tampering scrutiny. Still, Holiday is a big get, a strong guard capable of playing both backcourt spots and guarding more than that. Torrey Craig, Bryn Forbes, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are other new arrivals, changing up the chemistry while plugging holes left by Eric Bledsoe, Wesley Matthews, Ersan Ilyasova, Robin Lopez, Marvin Williams and Kyle Korver. What \u2019 s missing: Changing personnel is one thing. Changing tactics and, better yet, changing results are what really count. Milwaukee needs to demonstrate that they\u2019re more than a 3-point hoisting crew built around Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s disruptive penetration. Khris Middleton needs to play more forcefully night in, night out. Holiday can pose pick-and-roll danger, a nice addition. Defensively, the Bucks can be the league\u2019s best for the third straight season \u2026 as long as they\u2019re dare-you-to-make-them approach to 3-point shooters holds. And Antetokounmpo needs to up his game, developing a mid-range jumper and reliability from the foul line.

It got old, and it demanded new \u2013 something, anything new. If not roster, then coaching staff, and that\u2019s exactly what Indiana general manager Kevin Pritchard did, hiring Toronto assistant Nate Bjorkgren, who in turn rounded up a new staff. Whatever improvement the Pacers achieve this season will be credited mostly to their input in philosophy, style and points of emphasis. Whether that means a taste of the East semifinals remains to be seen. What\u2019s New? Bjorkgren will be hoping to replicate his former boss Nick Nurse\u2019s success in sliding one seat over, albeit without Kawhi Leonard coming aboard. The Pacers almost stubbornly resisted the NBA tilt toward 3-point mania and ever-switching defenses under his predecessor Nate McMillan. McMillan got a lot of mileage and commitment out of his old-school ways, but finishing last in 3-point attempts, last in free throws and down the rankings in pace wasn\u2019t working in springtime. T.J. Warren, after his bubble breakout, might enjoy working again with his development guy when they were in Phoenix. The starting lineup looks solid, despite the surprising stat they only played 86 minutes together in 2019-20. What\u2019s Missing: Wanting to play faster and actually doing it are two different things, though most of the Pacers seem capable \u2013 if Victor Oladipo doesn\u2019t ball-stop too often. As much as his sustained health, Oladipo\u2019s frame of mind (does he want to commit or leave?) could move Indiana\u2019s mood meter almost by the day. The Myles Turner-Domantas Sabonis big tandem ought to work, but \u201cought\u201d still isn\u2019t \u201cwill\u201d \u2013 we need more evidence that Turner can play offense out to the arc and give Sabonis more high-post flexibility. Malcolm Brogdon | 16.5 PTS, 4.9 REB, 7.1 AST The underrated playmaker will need to develop rhythm with Oladipo. Victor Oladipo | 14.5 PTS, 3.9 REB, 2.9 AST Seeking return to All-Star form after long injury layoffs. Myles Turner | 12.1 PTS, 6.6 REB, 2.1 BLK Prototype 3-and-D \u201cstretch 5\u201d needs to boost results on both ends. T.J.

Indiana Pacers, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Pacers weren\u2019t shy about pointing out McMillan\u2019s 3-16 playoff record when they fired him, so we\u2019ll work with the assumption that\u2019s where they seek real progress. That won\u2019t be easy from a middle-to-low seed in an improved Eastern Conference, but continuous improvement through the first 72 can get them there for the next seven.

Subtraction was the function that grabbed the biggest headlines for the Bulls in their layoff since last March. Patience had run out on the front office duo of VP John Paxson and GM Gar Forman, and coach Jim Boylen (39-84 in parts of two seasons) never seemed to win over fans at all. Year 3 of what was sold as a two-year rebuild saw empty seats at United Center \u2014 pre-virus \u2014 and prompted chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and president (son) Michael Reinsdorf to act. What \u2019 s new? New executive VP Arturas Karnisovas and GM Marc Eversley got credit upon being hired for never having messed up with the Bulls. New coach Billy Donovan was an even bigger hit, it seemed, giving Chicago its first legit NBA coach since Tom Thibodeau was dumped in 2015. Donovan is installing styles at both ends that worked for his Oklahoma City teams (243-157, five postseason berths), though he\u2019ll have to find his versions of Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Paul George or Chris Paul. The Bulls might have budding stars but no proven ones. What \u2019 s missing: Chicago will see if Coby White, last year\u2019s rookie from North Carolina, has point guard playmaker skills to go with the shooting guard aptitude he showed in his first season. In fact, most of the rotation players have much to prove to turn alleged potential into production. LaVine won\u2019t reach his All-Star ambitions unless his team pushes toward .500. Wendell Carter Jr. needs to show why he drew Al Horford comparisons. Lauri Markkanen will get a chance for more than catching-and-shooting. The Bulls seek all these improvements without losing their solid defensive chops \u2014 though they did lose feisty guards Kris Dunn and Shaquille Harrison. Coby White | 13.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.7 apg Will be given first crack at handling point guard role, despite shooting guard skills. Zach LaVine | 25.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 4.2 apg Needs to translate near All-Star scoring prowess into winning. Wendell Carter Jr. | 11.3 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 1.2 apg Carter is seeking deeper shots, despite shooting 19.7% on 3-pointers in his NBA career. Lauri Markkanen | 14.7 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.5 apg Took a step backward in 2019-20, now he owes the Bulls two. Thaddeus Young | 10.3 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 1.8 apg Veteran asset miscast last year, trade prospect to help contender. Garrett Temple | 10.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.5 apg Needed for wing defense after the departures of Dunn and Harrison. Tomas Satoransky | 9.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 5.4 apg Chicago\u2019s best playmaker, but he\u2019s facing minutes decline and could be a trade target. Patrick Williams | 9.2 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 1.0 apg (Florida State) Didn\u2019t start even once in college, raising eyebrows as No. 4 pick. Chicago Bulls, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions SEASON PREDICTION One good thing about not overhauling the roster is that Karnisovas, Eversley and Donovan will be cooking with nearly the same groceries that Paxson, Forman and Boylen had. The bosses have the chance, then, to show clearly what they bring to the table, while trying to develop or just wring more out of the players. Grabbing the brass ring of a play-in spot would be success, but several other East losers may have improved more.

With just two one-and-done playoff trips, and a combined 164 games under .500 in the past 11 seasons, it made sense for new general manager Troy Weaver to embrace changes for 2020-21. He got busy as soon as he could, where he could, and now only four players return from last season\u2019s core: Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Sekou Doumboya and Svi Mykhailiuk. Wholesale changes are no assurance the Pistons can improve on their 20-46 uninvited-from-the-bubble results, but they might be more fun while finding out. What\u2019s New? Weaver took some grief early in free agency when it appeared he was trying to corner the world\u2019s market of journeymen centers, and even more as big man Christian Wood, arguably Detroit\u2019s best player last season, was signed and traded to Houston. When the smoke cleared, though, the roster had pieces for coach Dwane Casey to mix and match almost endlessly and a nice \u2014 if this matters to a team focused on rebuilding \u2014 combination of youth, experience (Griffin, Rose) and players somewhere in the middle (Grant, Plumlee). Griffin and Rose, if they stay healthy and productive, could be targeted in trades for more potential. But there already is a good amount with top pick Killian Hayes in line for starter\u2019s minutes, second-year man Doumboya and rookies Isaiah Stewart, Deividas Sirvydis and Saddiq Bey. What\u2019s Missing: Familiarity with each other and their games, and any obvious pecking order after the two multiple All-Stars are two early-season needs. The better Griffin and Rose play, the greater the chance they won\u2019t be around to help the Pistons close the season. Grant will need to guard against playing \u201cup to\u201d his new $20 million salary. Hayes provides a wiry, lefthanded pick-and-roll practitioner at the point, but may required a short leash while learning. Nurturing the other young players, without too much scarring from losing, is a top priority that might challenge a willing-but-frequently-unable defense. Killian Hayes | 11.6 PTS, 2.8 REB, 5.4 AST (overseas) The No. 7 pick gets \u201cpoint guard of future\u201d baptism early. Delon Wright | 6.9 PTS, 3.8 REB, 3.3 AST Former Raptors backup excited to reunite with coach Casey. Mason Plumlee | 7.2 PTS, 5.2 REB, 2.5 AST Valued for his screens, rolls to the rim and defense. Jerami Grant | 12.0 PTS, 3.5 REB, 1.2 AST So helpful off Denver\u2019s bench, gets big payday and bigger role. Blake Griffin | 15.5 PTS, 4.7 REB, 18 games Concerns about bum knee allegedly answered in camp. Derrick Rose | 18.1 PTS, 2.4 REB, 5.6 AST Career revived as Sixth Man candidate, Pistons\u2019 spark. Svi Mykhailiuk | 9.0 PTS, 1.9 REB, 1.9 AST Should see more chances as catch-and-shoot marksman. Jahlil Okafor | 8.1 PTS, 4.2 REB, 1.2 AST Former all-rookie pick gets fresh start, 2-year guarantee. Detroit Pistons, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions There\u2019s a 52-pickup feel to this season, with new players slotting into new roles around a couple of veterans who might wind up as placeholders. The best combinations are TBD, with matchups dictating minutes from night to night. The answers at as many as four spots might not even be on the roster yet. Pistons fans will see this get worse before it gets better, at least on the bottom line. Predicted finish: 21-51 * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Coach John Beilein, whose college chops supposedly would translate well to young pros, alienated a number of players and was out in February. Replacement J.B. Bickerstaff slid over for 11 games until, oops!, virus shutdown. So what exactly was that? Flashes of promise, interspersed with horrible defense and too many setbacks. In other words, plenty of room for improvement, kids! What\u2019s New? Cleveland\u2019s most notable acquisition came via the Draft, where it snagged 6-foot-6 Isaac Okoro out of Auburn. Considered the moment he was drafted to be the Cavaliers\u2019 best defender on the wing, some wondered if that was enough to justify spending the No. 5 selection. But desperate times call for \u2026 you know. The Cavs ranked last in defensive field-goal percentage, near the bottom in steals, blocks and forcing turnovers, and got outscored by 7.9 points per game. Against that backdrop, Okoro \u2014 even as a rookie, who often get schooled individually by wily NBA scorers \u2014 can have an impact. Collin Sexton, Cleveland\u2019s primary ballhandler, is a mirror opposite in some ways. He\u2019s a gifted scorer whose passing and defense lag badly, which has a ripple effect in disrupting the offense. Kevin Love and Andre Drummond are expensive known quantities on the front line, not in sync with the rebuild. What\u2019s Missing: Bickerstaff was stressing effort and intangibles in the truncated training camp. Normally that\u2019s the last refuge of a coach who\u2019s searching, but this team is young and needs to absorb those qualities. Teamwork, unselfishness, consistency, accountability all were ingredients often missing from last year\u2019s Cavs. Individually, Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr. have skilled but incomplete games in vying for minutes alongside Sexton. Though always-helpful Larry Nance Jr. might come off the bench, he could play a role as big as any teammate. Cedi Osman might shift to reserve status after two years starting. Collin Sexton | 20.8 PTS, 3.1 REB, 3.0 AST Proven NBA scorer but still lacking as playmaker, defender. Kevin Porter Jr. | 10.0 PTS, 3.2 REB, 2.2 AST Legal trouble, late start puts pressure on early role. Andre Drummond | 17.7 PTS, 15.2 REB, 2.7 AST Big man opts back in with big numbers ($28.7 million salary). Isaac Okoro | 12.9 PTS, 4.4 REB, 2.0 AST (NCAA) Defensive difference maker for a roster in dire need of D. Kevin Love | 17.6 PTS, 9.8 REB, 3.2 AST Veteran offensive talent soldering on in rebuild. Larry Nance Jr . | 10.1 PTS, 7.3 REB, 2.2 AST Overlooked contributor across board with trade value. Cedi Osman | 11.0 PTS, 3.6 REB, 2.4 AST Skill set and upside may make more sense off bench. Darius Garland | 12.3 PPG, 1.9 REB, 3.9 AST Lottery pick (No. 5) looked overmatched but raw ability clear. Cleveland Cavaliers, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions Season Prediction Cleveland\u2019s assemblage of young guards and wings need reps, either to develop into the contributors they can become or to eliminate themselves from the long game. Its bigs can shoulder heavy loads, while showcasing themselves for possible relocations. Bickerstaff finally has a chance without the \u201cinterim\u201d yoke around his neck, so he\u2019s going to work as hard as any coach in the league. Add it together and the Cavs should be interesting, if not very victorious. Predicted finish: 22-50 * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Jimmy Butler experience paid off immediately after he joined the Heat and he was the sparked a special season for coach Erik Spoelstra. Bam Adebayo coming into his own as an All-Star aided the cause, as did the pop rookies Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro delivered (as well as the sharpshooting of Duncan Robinson provided). Veteran point guard Goran Dragic\u2019s resurgence in the restart elevated Miami, as did the contributions of veteran trade-deadline additions Jae Crowder and Andre Iguodala. Everything came together at the perfect time to highlight the \u201cHeat culture\u201d that team president Pat Riley has cultivated for decades. Miami came up short against the Lakers as it battled injuries to Dragic and Adebayo. Now comes the encore: with the element of surprise replaced by increased expectations. What \u2019 s new? Adebayo has a new max contact. Dragic, spurred by playful threats of bodily harm from his bromance partner Butler, re-signed as well. In fact, 12 of the players from The Finals team return, with key free-agent additions Avery Bradley and Maurice Harkless (and rookie Precious Achiuwa) coming on board, too. Former Heat star, All-Star and NBA champion Caron Butler joined the coaching staff in an underrated culture fit. All of the new additions fit the mold Riley relishes on his roster and staff: hard hat-type guys with a relentless work ethic and the physical and mental toughness to compete at all times. With an understanding of what will be expected in focus in the locker room, the Heat shouldn\u2019t have to deal with any growing pains. What \u2019 s missing: While the desire for an extended offseason might have been high in most places, Spoelstra didn\u2019t mince his words when addressing Miami\u2019s quick turnaround. \u201cIt\u2019s a quicker turnaround for those kind of teams, but if you consistently go to The Finals \u2026 but that\u2019s the price of chasing something great.\u201d Spoelstra knows what it takes to win championships. He also knows that the moment presents itself and could vanish in an instant, so there\u2019s no sense in holding anything back. The balance of seasoned vets and up-and-coming young talent puts the Heat in a unique position to compete now without compromising its future. They have everything needed to stay in the mix at the top of the East standings for the foreseeable future. Jimmy Butler |19.9 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 6.0 apg Elevated his game to superstar level in The Finals while dueling with LeBron James. Goran Dragic | 16.2 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 5.1 apg Veteran point guard was Heat playoff MVP prior to injury suffered in Game 1 of The Finals. Bam Adebayo | 15.9 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 5.1 apg All-Star big man has only scratched the surface of the all-around game that fuels Miami\u2019s attack. Duncan Robinson | 13.5 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 1.4 apg The ultimate floor-spacer whose lack of confidence defensively has to improve. Maurice Harkless | 5.8 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.1. apg Versatile forward is a defensive ace who can stick shots from the perimeter. Tyler Herro | 13.5 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 2.2 apg Shooting star showed out in the bubble and will be hard to keep off the floor in sophomore season. Avery Bradley | 8.6 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 1.3 apg Two-time All-Defensive team selection brings versatility and an underrated offensive skill set. Kendrick Nunn | 15.3 pts, 2.7 reb, 3.3 ast Kia Rookie Of the Year runner up could be a Kia Sixth Man candidate this season. Andre Iguodala | 4.6 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 2.4 apg Former Finals MVP and All-Star still has enough in the tank to be an impact player. Miami Heat, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Heat learned more about themselves in the bubble than perhaps any other team. They bought into Butler\u2019s tough talk and saw their new star live up to it as well. The abbreviated offseason makes it easy for the Heat to pick up where they left off in the bubble, earning league-wide respect for their Finals showing. Spoelstra is criminally underrated, a championship coach whose name rarely gets tossed around in conversations about the NBA\u2019s best coaches. That narrative, and others, will fuel the culture cocoon Riley has created. With all of the pieces they have in place now, the spot at the top of the Eastern Conference mountain there for Miami\u2019s taking.

Coach Steve Clifford\u2019s crew is good enough to make the postseason, but injuries and roster limitation keep them from doing anything else there. Orlando has a legitimate All-Star (Nikola Vucevic), quality starters (Evan Fournier and Aaron Gordon) a top-flight bench scorer (Terrence Ross) and young prospects (Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Mo Bamba). And it\u2019s still not enough to move the Magic\u2019s needle. Add up Draft mishaps, injuries (Gordon, Isaac and Bamba had their seasons sacked by injuries, illness or both) and uncertainty at point guard and you have to give Clifford credit for keeping things together long enough to get things on track. The Magic could have easily missed the playoffs last season. What \u2019 s new? There\u2019s little in the way of plug-and-play help that was acquired. Rookie guard Cole Anthony will be inserted into the backcourt mix after D.J. Augustin left for Milwaukee in free agency. Forward Chuma Okeke \u2014 the Magic\u2019s first-round pick in the 2019 Draft who missed all of last season recovering from a torn ACL \u2014 is also set to fight for a spot in the rotation. Dwayne Bacon should figure prominently as well. But that\u2019s the extent of the talent infusion Clifford has to work with. That puts the bullseye on Vucevic, who was spectacular during the restart. He averaged 20.4 points per game and shot 53% overall and 40% on 3-pointers in the seeding games. He took his game up a notch against the Bucks, averaging 28 ppg, 11 rpg and 4 apg in a first-round series loss. The elevation of the existing talent, starting with Vucevic, is the only real hope for something new for Clifford to work with in 2020-21. What \u2019 s missing: Isaac is a promising young talent, but injuries have derailed him of late and he\u2019ll miss this season recovering from the torn left ACL and meniscus he suffered in the Magic\u2019s second seeding game. It was a brutal finish to a trying season for Isaac, who had become the two-way force the Magic believed he could be when they selected him sixth overall in the 2017 Draft. Isaac\u2019s emergence cleared the way for Gordon\u2019s shift to small forward \u2026 until that was abandoned in February when James Ennis was acquired and Gordon went back to power forward. Issac\u2019s absence and Bamba\u2019s quest for a breakthrough season leaves a gaping hole in the rotation. For what it\u2019s worth, the training camp chatter is that Bamba (and his 7-foot-10 wingspan) appears to have made some strides in his recovery from the positive COVID-19 test that obliterated any conditioning gains he had made. Markelle Fultz | 12.1 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 5.1 apg Needs to take advantage of his opportunity in the final year of his rookie deal. Evan Fournier | 18.5 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 3.2 apg Struggled mightily in the playoffs and needs a serious bounce-back effort. James Ennis | 8.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.1 apg Versatile swingman made a seamless transition into the rotation after a February trade. Nikola Vucevic | 19.6 ppg, 10.9 rpg, 3.6 apg Played some of the best basketball of his career during the 2019-20 restart. Aaron Gordon | 14.4 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 3.7 apg Magic still waiting for the high-flying forward to polish the rougher edges of his game. Michael Carter-Williams | 7.2 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.4 apg Former Kia Rookie of the Year has found a home in Clifford\u2019s point guard friendly system. Terrence Ross | 14.7 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 1.1 apg One of the most reliable bench scorers in the league. Dwayne Bacon | 5.7 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 1.3 apg A steal if he can relocate his 3-point shooting touch (43.7%) from two seasons ago. Cole Anthony | 18.5 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 4.0 apg (UNC) Supremely talented and plenty confident, a potential steal if he plays to his potential. Orlando Magic, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions It\u2019s hard to see the Magic outperforming their modest expectations without a legitimate breakout season from Fultz, Gordon, Bamba or even Anthony. Orlando didn\u2019t shake up its core group and will play this season without its most promising young talent (Isaac). Their solid defensive rating last season (11th) and Clifford\u2019s track record of stout defense should be what keeps the Magic in the hunt this season. This crew, though, seems ticketed for play-in tournament territory and a chance to earn a third straight playoff appearance.

Coach Scott Brooks and a rag-tag roster showed up for the NBA restart without Beal, Wall and several other regulars. Last season\u2019s brutal campaign included a more competitive-than-anticipated group, but the same lottery-bound results. Even with Beal posting the best scoring season of his career, the Wizards didn\u2019t make the playoffs. They exited the bubble in wait-and-see mode, wondering if Wall would come back from his two-year injury absence the same player and if he\u2019d be ready for a new role with Beal as the headliner. Ultimately, they will never find out after Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard traded Wall and a protected first-round pick to Houston for former Kia MVP Russell Westbrook (and his equally massive contract). The deal ended a decade-long run with Wall, the former No. 1 overall pick and five-time All-Star who struggled to stay healthy his last few seasons in D.C. What \u2019 s new? The Westbrook trade didn\u2019t happen until the Wednesday before training camp began, but it was the blockbuster move that had been rumored for weeks. When Wall is healthy, he\u2019s clearly one of the league\u2019s best point guards \u2014 but Westbrook has been a cut above that during that same timeframe. A nine-time All-NBA selection, Westbrook remains one of the league\u2019s most impactful players. Washington is hoping that dynamic combination of Westbrook and Beal will help lift an inexperienced roster (13 players have three years or less of NBA experience) into the mix for one of the play-in tournament spots. Veteran shooter Davis Bertans signed a five-year, $80 million deal and Robin Lopez and Raul Neto joined up, too. Draft prizes Deni Avdija (No. 9 overall pick) and Michigan State point guard Cassius Winston (No. 53 pick) join a group of unproven youngsters who will be folded into the culture shift that will be this unpredictable season in Washington. What \u2019 s missing: A clear vision of the future. The Wizards are still operating on the tender footing that comes with the long-term uncertainty surrounding their franchise player (Beal has two years left before he hits free agency). Adding Westbrook is a sign that the organization is willing to convince Beal it is serious about building a playoff team around him. But there\u2019s so much more work to be done. The roster-upgrading process is still in its infancy as the Wizards are figuring out exactly what they have in youngsters Troy Brown Jr., Rui Hachimura, Jerome Robinson, Moritz Wagner and Isaac Bonga. Sheppard spoke of a \u201ccost certainty\u201d in acquiring Westbrook, which is the only thing they can be certain of. Much of what Brooks and his staff do this season will be betting on the unknown. Bradley Beal | 30.5 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 6.1 apg A proven elite scorer with the potential to be an elite two-way player. Russell Westbrook | 27.7 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 7.0 apg Former MVP is still a game-changer and force 13 seasons into Hall of Fame career. Thomas Bryant | 13.2 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 1.1 bpg Rugged big man brings his lunch pail every night, but has limitations. Rui Hachimura | 13.5 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.8 apg Uneven rookie season hasn\u2019t dimmed internal expectations for second-year forward. Isaac Bonga | 5.0 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 1.2 apg An underrated young talent (21 years old) whose defense is his biggest plus Ish Smith | 10.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 4.9 apg As reliable in his reserve role as Westbrook is spectacular in his as the starter. Davis Bertans | 15.4 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.7 apg Sweet-shooting big who found his niche as a force off the bench last season. Troy Brown Jr. | 10.4 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 2.6 apg Talented and versatile forward could easily fit into the starting spot instead of Bonga. Moritz Wagner | 8.7 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 1.2 apg Comes off his best season in years and sheds some of his quirkiness. Washington Wizards, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions Based strictly on the potential fireworks of a Beal-Westbrook backcourt, the Wizards have a fighting chance to slug their way into the playoff (or play-in tournament) mix this season. They immediately join the list of the league\u2019s most electrifying and productive backcourt tandems. Chasing a playoff berth will also require Brooks working some of the same magic he did with Westbrook as his point guard in Oklahoma City (from 2008-15). Beal and Westbrook\u2019s collective health will be of the utmost importance, given the lack of star power elsewhere and the Wizards\u2019 depth issues. If Avdija winds up being ready earlier than expected, that will give the Wizards another unexpected boost. Either way, there should be just enough to keep this crew relevant in the playoff hunt this season. Predicted finish: 36-36. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

They would soon embark on a plane ride home that would serve as the precipice for descent into an offseason full of drama that would carry into 2020 training camp. While the plane was in the air on the flight back to Houston, coach Mike D\u2019Antoni reportedly told general manager Daryl Morey that he would not be returning to lead the Rockets for the 2020-21 season. That decision became the first domino in a Houston offseason rife with change. What\u2019s new? After D\u2019Antoni\u2019s departure, Morey cited personal reasons in announcing a resignation that wouldn\u2019t be effective until Nov. 1. In the meantime, the Rockets announced the hiring of former longtime Mavericks assistant coach Stephen Silas as the replacement for D\u2019Antoni. On Nov. 2, the Philadelphia 76ers introduced Morey as their new president of basketball operations. But in the immediate aftermath of Morey\u2019s resignation, the Rockets had already promoted Rafael Stone to general manager. The changes didn\u2019t stop there, as star guards Russell Westbrook and James Harden both reportedly requested trades in November. The Rockets granted Westbrook\u2019s wishes by moving him to Washington for John Wall and a 2023 protected first-round pick. Houston also traded Robert Covington to Portland for Trevor Ariza, the No. 16 pick and a 2021 first-round pick. The club jettisoned Ariza and the 16 th pick as part of a sign-and-trade deal with Detroit to bring in Christian Wood. The Rockets also signed DeMarcus Cousins in free agency as well as Sterling Brown, and drafted Kenyon Martin Jr. in the second round. As for Harden, Houston is taking its time with the 2018 MVP, as Silas hopes the sides can work things out so the superstar guard can lead the Rockets into 2020-21. What\u2019s missing: At first, it was Harden. He missed the first two days of training camp and posted pictures to social media of various parties he was attending, while the rest of the Rockets were reporting to training camp and fielding questions from the media about the absence of the team\u2019s star player. Harden eventually showed up in Houston on Dec. 8. It\u2019s obvious that trust is what\u2019s missing right now between Harden and the Rockets organization. It\u2019s the same between Harden and his teammates, many of which he hasn\u2019t even played with yet. Silas wants to be the catalyst in bridging the gap. But if he can\u2019t, the question becomes when will the Rockets be ultimately forced to deal Harden? John Wall | 20.7 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 8.7 apg (2018-19) Hasn\u2019t played in two seasons, but if he returns to form you could argue he\u2019s an upgrade over Westbrook. James Harden | 34.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 7.5 apg Beef with the organization isn\u2019t fair to Silas, who has a reputation for building relationships. Eric Gordon | 14.4 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 1.5 apg Never got on track due to injuries and the limited opportunities that came with both Harden and Westbrook on the floor. Christian Wood |13.1 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.0 apg Signed for $41 million, but there\u2019s uncertainty about how good he really is after a strong 2019-20 on a bad Detroit team. P.J. Tucker | 6.9 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.6 apg At 35, the scrappy undersized defensive stopper wants the bag as he\u2019s playing in the final year of his contract. DeMarcus Cousins | 16.3 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 3.6 apg (2018-19) Four-time All-Star has been robbed of the last two seasons by injuries. Ben McLemore | 10.1 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 0.8 apg Knocked down at least 40% from 3-point range in each of the last two seasons. Danuel House Jr. | 10.5 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 1.3 apg He\u2019s apologized verbally, but needs to make amends on the floor for being tossed from the NBA bubble for rules violations. Houston Rockets, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions This one is tough because there\u2019s so much fluidity regarding James Harden, and he\u2019s such a transcendent player that his presence or absence can drastically affect a team\u2019s prospects both directions. So, we\u2019ll make this prediction assuming Harden will be there for 2020-21. If Harden buys into Silas\u2019 system that will feature plenty of ball sharing, and more optionality in terms of playing conventional or small, there\u2019s a chance he might experience his best season as a Houston Rocket based off the weapons surrounding him. If the organization is forced to move him, you can expect the Rockets to finish somewhere near the middle of the pack. Predicted finish: 40-32. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The Hornets have failed to reach the postseason in 13 of the last 16 seasons, which means they needed a seismic upgrade in talent. A move into the playoff mix isn\u2019t there yet, but there is hope after the offseason additions of veteran Gordon Hayward and No. 3 overall pick LaMelo Ball. The Hornets still lack the foundational pieces that will prevent a hard road ahead, but coach James Borrego has done his best to instill a defensive mindset. There are no All-Star caliber players to lean on in Charlotte, but that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t players on the roster who have those ambitions. But dreaming about it isn\u2019t enough. Terry Rozier and Devonte\u2019 Graham got their crack at it last season. Now, Hayward and Ball take their turn. What \u2019 s new? The Hayward sign-and-trade with Boston shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise. The Hornets tried to get Hayward back in 2014 when he was on the Utah Jazz. The mutual interest remained, and when Hayward dove into free agency, everything lined up and he jumped at the chance to lead his own team. One of the youngsters in his charge will be Ball, who comes with a built-in global following on social media (and the drama that comes with it). Borrego sees two jumbo playmakers that he didn\u2019t have last season. These new additions present all sorts of possibilities for the Hornets to speed things up from the snail\u2019s pace (30th in the league) they operated at last season. Between Graham, Rozier, Hayward and Ball, the Hornets hope to unlock a myriad of playbook options. What \u2019 s missing: The connectivity that binds good teams together is a work in progress, especially when you\u2019re preparing to lean two newcomers as the Hornets are. There is a gamble in that regard that the Hornets are taking by putting all of these pieces together. Will Graham and Rozier be receptive to Hayward sharing some of the leadership load they inherited in the wake of Kemba Walker\u2019s departure? Is anyone going to be willing to let Ball run wild as a rookie? So much of what goes on this season will depend on the pliability of the players. Borrego knows what it takes to build a winning culture, having done his time in San Antonio. Doing so without the aid of a Tim Duncan, Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili, however, is a different lift. Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington, two young forwards on the right development track, cannot have their development sacrificed for the greater good. Devonte\u2019 Graham | 18.2 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 7.5 apg One of the league\u2019s most improved players \u2026 and he\u2019s just getting started. Terry Rozier | 18.0 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 4.1 apg Got his wish after playing a reserve role in Boston and took advantage of the opportunity. Cody Zeller | 11.1 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 1.5 apg Injuries have sapped the hype that was a part of the conversation early on. P.J Washington | 12.2 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 2.1 apg Spectacular start foreshadowed a better-than-expected rookie season for the rugged forward. Gordon Hayward | 17.5 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 4.1 apg Veteran swingman is convinced he\u2019s in the prime of his career and finally in the right spot. LaMelo Ball | 17.0 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 6.8 apg (Illawarra) Touted by many as the most talented player in the Draft, but still has much to prove. Miles Bridges | 13.0 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 1.8 apg Productive youngster who has to show marked improvement this season. Bismack Biyombo | 7.4 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 0.9 bpg Hornets betting on familiarity with their former big man rim protector. Malik Monk | 10.3 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 2.1 apg Enigmatic shooter\/scorer is running out of chance to prove himself. Charlotte Hornets, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The math just doesn\u2019t add up for the Hornets (new additions + holdovers = ?) right now, unless there is a shocking surprise. That means Hayward rediscovering his All-Star form, Ball front-running for Kia Rookie of the Year or (one of) Graham, Rozier, Bridges or Washington taking a huge leap. That puts pressure on the entire group to accelerate the cohesion-building process \u2014 and asking Charlotte to do so without a transcendent star to help circumvent that. If this team scraps its way into play-in territory, consider this season a success for the Hornets. The reality is probably somewhere on the fringe of that.

An early fall minicamp (with COVID-19 health and safety restrictions, of course) was designed to give the Hawks some much-needed time together between the March shutdown of the season and the open of camp for the 2020-21 season. But with so many new faces added to the mix, that session will end up being more beneficial from an individual growth and development standpoint than anything tangible benefit for the team the Hawks will put on the floor this month. Trae Young and John Collins, however, put the finishing touches on huge seasons for the young franchise cornerstones. Young earned an All-Star starting gig and proved himself to be one of the league\u2019s most dynamic young stars. Meanwhile, Collins shook off the funk from a 25-game suspension to close with a bang; averaging career best scoring and rebounding numbers along the way. There wasn\u2019t much else to get crazy excited about in a 20-47 season that exposed the Hawks\u2019 lack of quality depth and didn\u2019t include a single appearance by bouncy big man Clint Capela, acquired in a trade with Houston, because of injury. What \u2019 s new? Basically everything surrounding the young core. The Hawks went into the offseason with the most cap space of any team in the league and general manager Travis Schlenk finally cashed in all the assets he could in a truncated offseason. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce has so many new faces to work with he\u2019ll be exploring his options nonstop early on this season. Veterans Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Rajon Rondo, Kris Dunn and Solomon Hill highlight the free agent haul. USC center Onyeka Okongwu (the 6th pick in the Draft) adds even more frontcourt depth and versatility. And former Pacers coach Nate McMillan, fresh off an appearance in the playoffs in the bubble, joined Pierce\u2019s staff as well. With a stated goal of making the playoffs this season, there won\u2019t be any excuses for a revamped team that\u2019s suddenly two-deep at every position. The starting group has young legs and star power and they\u2019ll have ample reinforcements with plenty of seasoning. Rondo working as a team leader and point guard mentor for Young could prove to be the most critical offseason move of all. What \u2019 s missing: Chemistry and seasoning for the youngsters are the main ingredients missing for this bunch. They didn\u2019t get the normal month or so of pick-up ball and skill work that always benefits a new group. And with nine new faces, that\u2019s time that would have been extremely beneficial. Schlenk and Pierce talk often about not skipping steps in the process of turning the program around, and for the most part they\u2019ve stuck to that theory. But this one was beyond their control. The coronavirus pandemic forced them into virtual mode (like everyone else in the league), thus eliminating the critical feeling out period that accompanies a normal offseason. Time will tell just how significant an impact that lack of familiarity will have on this group. Pierce is counting on the plug-and-play readiness of the free-agent group to facilitate a transformation from lottery regular to a postseason contender. Trae Young | 29.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 9.3 apg Already an All-Star with all the tools but needs to improve defensively to go to another level. John Collins | 21.6 ppg, 10.1 rpg, 1.6 bpg Improved outside shooter and a perfect pick-an-roll partner for Young. Clint Capela | 13.9 ppg, 13.8 rpg, 1.8 bpg Elite rebounder and rim runner\/protector the Hawks have lacked. Bogdan Bogdanovic |15.1 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 3.4 apg Underrated athlete with deep shooting range is ideal backcourt fit alongside Young. Kevin Huerter | 12.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 3.8 apg Versatile young talent who is still growing into his own as a high-level role player. Rajon Rondo | 7.1 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.0 apg Two-time champion brings veteran savvy and ability to perform his best on biggest stage. Danilo Gallinari | 18.7 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.9 apg Classic stretch-four who could push for Sixth Man honors this season. Kris Dunn | 7.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 3.4 apg A lockdown defender who can guard three positions and facilitate in a pinch. De\u2019Andre Hunter | 12.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.8 apg A starter as a rookie, should be an effective defensive specialist off the bench. Cam Reddish | 10.5 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 1.1 spg Showed promise down the stretch of last season after rough opening. Atlanta Hawks, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The baby steps era is over for these Hawks. You don\u2019t engineer the most intriguing offseason of any team in the league and not raise the expectations to playoff (or at least play-in tournament) level. Schlenk knows it. Pierce knows it. And so does everyone else in the organization, from the executive offices down to the ball boys. The locker room is where the embrace of those raised expectations has to be translated into a much more sound product on both ends of the floor. The Hawks ranked in the bottom five in both offensive and defensive efficiency last season. That won\u2019t work anymore, not with the extreme roster makeover that went on in the offseason. This is no doubt a team that should compete for a playoff spot. Predicted finish: 37-35 * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Mavericks governor Mark Cuban tweeted: \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d and that viewpoint isn\u2019t off base when you look at all Dallas accomplished last season behind the triple-double antics of 21-year-old superstar Luka Doncic, who propelled the most efficient offense in the play-by-play era. Coach Rick Carlisle and the Mavericks instantly knew this team needed to improve its collective toughness and middle-of-the-pack defense. What\u2019s new? Dallas traded sharpshooting guard Seth Curry on draft night for former Philadelphia guard Josh Richardson (and the 36th pick used to draft Tyler Bey), in addition to acquiring forward James Johnson, who moonlights as a mixed martial arts fighter, via a three-team trade that moved Justin Jackson to Oklahoma City and Delon Wright to Detroit. The moves accomplished a couple of objectives. First, the Mavericks added a little protection for Doncic for when opponents want to be chippy with the star guard. Second, the club became edgier and more athletic on the defensive end to shore up a unit that finished in the bottom half of the league last season in points allowed (112.1), defensive rating (111.2), points allowed in the paint (48.8) and points surrendered in transition (16.4). What\u2019s missing: Kristaps Porzingis, at least until January, as Dallas\u2019 second-leading scorer continues to recover from an October surgery that repaired the torn meniscus in his right knee. Porzingis first suffered the injury in Game 1 of their opening-round series against the Clippers, but he played the next two games before Dallas\u2019 medical staff ended up sitting him for the rest of the series. With the latest injury setback, Porzingis has now undergone surgery on both knees. That may be a cause for concern considering how Porzingis fits into the club\u2019s plans for the future. Carlisle has said Porzingis remains on schedule in his rehabilitation and is already participating in light on-court work. Dwight Powell should be running with the first unit for the early part of the season, but he\u2019s coming off a ruptured right Achilles tendon. Luka Doncic | 28.8 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 8.8 apg Eye-popping numbers should increase with Richardson alleviating some of the pressure on defense. Tim Hardaway Jr. | 15.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 1.9 apg Became just the second player in franchise history last season to knock down 200 or more 3-pointers (204). Josh Richardson | 13.7 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 2.9 apg Brought in to defend, don\u2019t forget about his 3-point shooting (career 36.3%) and playmaking ability. Dorian Finney-Smith | 9.5 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Slowed by hip ailments last season, but still started 68 games and has improved as a shooter. Kristaps Porzingis | 20.4 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 2.0 bpg The Unicorn wants to play on Christmas, but Carlisle has all but ruled that out. Dwight Powell | 9.4 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.5 spg Has run with the starters in Porzingis\u2019 spot throughout training camp. Maxi Kleber | 9.1 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.2 apg Versatility and experience as a fill-in starter will be needed as Carlisle tinkers with lineups early in the season. James Johnson | 8.4 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 2.3 apg Owns a 7-0 record in MMA bouts and 20-0 in kick-boxing matches. Dallas Mavericks, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions It\u2019s unknown whether the Mavericks will continue to rack up historic numbers on offense in Doncic\u2019s third season, but it\u2019s almost guaranteed the defense will be better in 2020-21 when you look at all the training camp time and resources put into improvement in that area. A better defense should result in a second-straight trip to the postseason if Porzingis\u2019 recovery goes as planned. The boost in collective toughness should reap benefits that send Dallas beyond just the opening round of the playoffs, as this team is now on the verge of becoming a serious title contender.

The Grizzlies dropped their first four seeding games on the way to a 2-6 record in the bubble. And despite losing Jaren Jackson Jr. for the season with a torn left meniscus, Memphis still advanced to the play-in game for the eighth seed. Ja Morant put on a show in defeat, dropping a career-high 35 points and eight assists to show the world he\u2019s a bonafide star. What\u2019s new? The Grizzlies added to their collection of young talent by drafting Desmond Bane before picking up Xavier Tillman Sr. late in the second round. But it appears Memphis was more committed to cohesion with its core group than outside talent acquisition. The low-key team\u2019s best decision was probably re-signing lockdown defender De\u2019Anthony Melton as a building block to a future featuring Morant, Jackson and Dillon Brooks. Melton\u2019s four-year deal worth $35 million could turn out to be a real bargain later down the road. What\u2019s missing: Two key players in forwards Jackson and Justise Winslow as Grizzlies vice president of basketball operations Zach Kleiman revealed in November that both will be out for the start of the season. Jackson suffered a torn left meniscus on Aug. 3 in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, while the injury-plagued Winslow is still recovering from a hip injury sustained back in July during a practice. The duo averages a combined 28.7 points and 11.2 rebounds. Winslow is expected to return fairly early in the season, but Jackson does not have an immediate timetable. Ja Morant | 17.8 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 7.3 apg NBA bigs quietly fear the young star posterizing them. Dillon Brooks | 16.2 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.1 apg Working at improving shot creation and stamina. Kyle Anderson | 5.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 2.4 apg Slow as molasses, but opponents still struggle to defend his point guard skillset. Jaren Jackson Jr. | 17.4 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 1.4 apg Grizzlies will miss his shooting and rim protection to start the season. Jonas Valanciunas | 14.9 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 1.1 bpg Throwback old-school bruiser finished 10 th in double-doubles last season. De\u2019Anthony Melton | 7.6 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 1.3 spg If 3-point shooting improves, the Grizz landed a three-and-D steal. Justise Winslow | 11.3 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 4.0 apg When healthy, athleticism and playmaking skills make for a perfect fit alongside Brooks, Morant and Jackson. Brandon Clarke | 12.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.4 apg Named first-team on the All-Rookie team last season. Memphis Grizzlies, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions Memphis probably takes a step back as it works through the early absences of Jackson and Winslow to start the season. But even if they returned fully healthy for the opener, their presence would do little to better the Grizzlies\u2019 postseason prospects. The team simply isn\u2019t quite ready as it looks to build around its talented young core of Morant, Brooks and Jackson. Memphis will make some noise, and Morant will always be much-watch TV. But the Grizzlies are a couple of years away from perennial postseason contention. Predicted finish: 31-41. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The Spurs played with a young, four-guard lineup that resulted in a breakneck pace and more freedom on the floor as Gregg Popovich stripped away much of San Antonio\u2019s typically rigid structure. The franchise missed making a 23 rd consecutive postseason appearance, but the youngsters performed so well in eight seeding games that Popovich decided to adopt that style of play moving forward for what will be the next evolution of San Antonio Spurs basketball. What\u2019s new? Aside from the new playing style, not much is new because the Spurs entered free agency with very little flexibility to upgrade. San Antonio took care of a couple of its own free agents by re-signing bigs Drew Eubanks and Jakob Poeltl along with Quinndary Weatherspoon, a second-round pick in the 2019 draft. San Antonio added a pair of promising prospects in the Draft, selecting Florida State guard Devin Vassell at No. 11 before taking Duke point guard Tre Jones 41 st overall. The Spurs typically don\u2019t play rookies early, but both have an outside shot to work their way into the rotation. Another new wrinkle you can expect from the Spurs is more 3-point shooting from Aldridge, who finished last season with career highs in makes (61) and attempts (157) from range. If Aldridge becomes a legitimate threat from deep, it spaces the floor for San Antonio\u2019s slashers to find driving lanes. Aldridge told NBA.com he\u2019s already feeling more comfortable shooting 3\u2019s than he did last season. What\u2019s missing: Definitely 3-point shooting with the leading scorers \u2013 DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge \u2013 spending the majority of their careers as mid-range specialists. San Antonio ranked 28 th last season in 3-point attempts (28.5) and fourth in accuracy (37.6%). There\u2019s also some uncertainty regarding how Aldridge fits into San Antonio\u2019s new style due to the fact he wasn\u2019t with the team in Orlando because he was rehabbing his injured shoulder. Popovich and several teammates have expressed confidence in Aldridge\u2019s ability to fit, but we haven\u2019t yet seen him play in a more up-tempo, free-flowing offense, in which he\u2019s asked to contribute more as a 3-point shooter. The Spurs lost a couple of their best outside shooters off the bench in Bryn Forbes, who signed a two-year deal with the Milwaukee Bucks and Marco Belinelli, who went back to Italy. Popovich revealed the Spurs could be missing three of the young stars from the bubble to start the season in Derrick White (toe), Keldon Johnson (foot) and Weatherspoon (knee). Dejounte Murray | 10.9 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 4.1 apg Made All-NBA defensive team in 2017-18 and poised to regain form in second season since tearing an ACL in 2018. Derrick White | 11.3 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 3.5 apg Two-way guard cranked up 3-point shooting in the bubble (eight per game), which is a sign of things to come. DeMar DeRozan | 22.1 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 5.6 apg Four-time All-Star is perennially slept on due to lack of 3-point shooting but improving on defense under Popovich. LaMarcus Aldridge |18.9 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 2.4 apg Coming off shoulder surgery, seven-time All-Star remains constant target of trade rumors. Jakob Poeltl | 5.6 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.4 bpg Former lottery pick is actually San Antonio\u2019s all-time leader in single season field goal percentage (.645 in 2018-19). Patty Mills | 11.6 ppg, 1.6 rpg, 1.8 apg Longest-tenured Spur plans to incorporate his playing style from the Australian national team into San Antonio\u2019s system. Rudy Gay | 10.8 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 1.7 apg Dropped 10 pounds in the offseason to fit better with the Spurs\u2019 expected playing style. Lonnie Walker IV | 6.4 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 1.1 apg Easily the most athletic player on the entire Spurs roster. San Antonio Spurs, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions They\u2019ll push teams. They\u2019ll be exciting to watch. And Popovich\u2019s tutelage almost automatically guarantees San Antonio a fighting chance to advance to the postseason. They\u2019ll finish better than last season, but it likely won\u2019t be good enough to make the playoffs. Popovich was smart in changing the team\u2019s style to fit the young, athletic personnel. The current crop of youngsters gives the franchise building blocks to create another 20-plus years of dominance in the future. San Antonio can jump back into the free-agency game next season when DeRozan and Aldridge are off the books. The Spurs will be knocking on the door of the playoffs this season, but it\u2019s doubtful they get in. Predicted finish: 35-37 *** Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

What\u2019s new? Two days after New Orleans lost its final game, the team announced it had fired Alvin Gentry. It marked the fourth time in five seasons the Pelicans missed the postseason, so David Griffin knew it was time to make a change. Enter Stan Van Gundy, who is charged with developing the team\u2019s promising young talent while improving a defense that ranked 21 st last season in efficiency. The organization then traded away fan favorite Jrue Holiday in a four-team deal that landed Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, three future first-round picks and two pick swaps, in addition to longtime Thunder center Steven Adams. That trade almost immediately improved the Pelicans\u2019 overall team defense, giving them a physical presence inside to pair up with franchise cornerstone Zion Williamson. The Pels finally closed out November by rewarding first-time All-Star Brandon Ingram with a five-year extension. What\u2019s missing: The ingredients for a perennial winner appear to be in place with Van Gundy and the collection of talent, headlined by Williamson. But the league\u2019s abbreviated preseason due to the quick return for the upcoming campaign could make it difficult for Van Gundy to build the requisite cohesion to compete in the West. Van Gundy and Griffin are looking to build a new culture in New Orleans that requires them incorporating new philosophies on a team that features eight new players. New Orleans lost 10 players through trades or free agency, leaving Josh Hart, Ingram, Ball and Williamson as the Pels\u2019 longest-tenured players. So, the cohesion isn\u2019t there yet. But it will be. Lonzo Ball | 11.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 7.0 apg Court vision and passing ability should fuel plenty of fast breaks. Eric Bledsoe | 14.9 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 5.4 apg Hard-nosed defender has been named to the All-Defensive team two consecutive seasons. Brandon Ingram | 23.8 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 4.2 apg The offensive package is there, but expect major strides on defense. Zion Williamson | 22.5 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 2.1 apg No physical limitations to start this season after sitting the first 44 games as a rookie. Steven Adams | 10.9 ppg, 9.3 rpg, 1.1 bpg Said Van Gundy after Adams\u2019 acquisition: \u201cYou\u2019re not punking the New Orleans Pelicans.\u201d Kira Lewis Jr. | 15.9 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 4.0 apg (college) Lightning-quick rookie will establish a breakneck pace for the second unit. Josh Hart | 10.1 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 1.7 apg Hit a career-high 121 3-pointers last season but wants to tweak mechanics to improve even more. J.J. Redick | 15.3 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 2.0 apg Spent five seasons playing for Van Gundy in Orlando. New Orleans Pelicans, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The culture that Griffin and Van Gundy are building in New Orleans could be special, and the players recognize as much, which is why you should expect everybody on the roster to be all-in for the upcoming season. The athleticism, talent and grit are there, and the commitment from the organization is strong. But you know all young squads must suffer their lumps. Still, this is a playoff team if it stays relatively healthy. New Orleans is being built to contend for years to come, and we\u2019re here for it. Predicted finish: 39-33. * * * Michael C.

Such was the stark reality for a team that lost Kevin Durant in free agency, Klay Thompson to knee surgery and Steph Curry for all but five games to a broken left hand. They forced a philosophical shift toward grooming players for the future to see which ones would compliment the core of Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green when everyone healed. That resulted in a string of difficult nights for a franchise that shuffled mostly young and untested players and absorbed defeats on a constant basis. The \u201clost\u201d year was beneficial with regard to the draft lottery, however, where the Warriors secured the No. 2 pick, so it wasn\u2019t a total loss. What \u2019 s new? The Warriors never emphasized the center position during their dynasty, mainly because they never had one good enough to command a large role, certainly not on a team with Curry and Thompson. Yet on draft night, they took James Wiseman, by far the best big man prospect. He\u2019s not a center who\u2019s considered a franchise-changer, though. Wiseman\u2019s college career at Memphis was cut short to a few weeks because of NCAA issues and yet his size and potential was highly regarded anyway. Hours before drafting Wiseman, the Warriors suffered a major setback when Thompson tore his Achilles during workouts. Golden State swung a deal to get Kelly Oubre with hopes he can reduce the absence of Thompson, who\u2019s done for the year. What \u2019 s missing: Aside from Thompson? Well, nothing is on that level of importance. Thompson worked hard to recover from 2019 knee surgery which cost him all of last season, only to be dealt another major blow . The Warriors must tweak their approach, then, and find other sources of shooting and defense that was lost when Thompson pulled up lame. The hope is Oubre and newcomer Kent Bazemore can enhance the team\u2019s perimeter defense and help Curry out in that regard; Thompson usually guarded the other team\u2019s leading scorer. Stephen Curry | 20.8 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 6.6 apg Ready to battle back after essentially missing a season and reclaim MVP-level status. Andrew Wiggins | 19.4 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 3.6 apg Enigmatic yet talented player looks to fit in and redo his sketchy reputation. Draymond Green | 8.0 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 6.2 apg A veteran who impacts both ends of the floor will need to improve his shooting this year. James Wiseman | 19.7 ppg, 10.3 rpg, 3.0 blk Rookie big man will be thrown to the fire early and asked to produce for a winner. Kelly Oubre | 18.7 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 1.5 ast Young swingman looks to replace the point production and presence of Thompson; good luck. Eric Paschall | 14.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 2.1 apg Physical forward took advantage of the ravaged Warriors to earn a longer look. Marquese Chriss | 9.3 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 1.9 apg A forgotten lottery pick is fighting to secure minutes and recover his career. Kent Bazemore | 8.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 1.3 apg Well-traveled forward brings a 3-point presence and defense to his former team. Golden State Warriors, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Warriors were thrown for a loop with Thompson\u2019s injury and now are caught in bit of a bind. They still have the mentality of a title contender because of Curry and Green, yet are also in transition with the rookie Wiseman and, to an extent, Oubre, who\u2019ll be asked to provide production for a winner. Can that transition be smooth and quick? Curry is too good for this to quality as a bridge year until Thompson returns, which means the Warriors will prosper, but maybe not to the level or extent they\u2019re used to.

Undrafted rookie Lu Dort gave James Harden fits in that opening round, emerging as a defensive stopper with some promise on the offensive end, while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander showcased plenty of signs throughout the season and in the bubble that he could be a franchise cornerstone for years to come, given more opportunity. What\u2019s new? Rather than build on the promise Oklahoma City showed last season, Thunder general manager Sam Presti thought with his head instead of his heart in charting the path moving forward. Presti opted to continue the rebuild he started last summer, explaining to The Daily Oklahoman that \u201cwhen you step back and take a clear-eyed, rational view of the season we had last year, and all of the randomness that occurred in our favor, the loss of future value we would be relinquishing for a small probability of replicating those performances, it was clear that the most objective path was to prioritize the future.\u201d That bold step played a role in the departure of coach Billy Donovan, who was replaced by Mark Daigneault, not to mention a continuation of transactions that have netted OKC 18 first-round picks and a slew of second-round selections through the 2027 NBA Draft. Player development is the mantra in OKC for the foreseeable future. What\u2019s missing: Paul was the most significant loss as the Thunder traded him for a collection of players and a 2022 first-round pick from the Suns. Oklahoma City will miss the veteran\u2019s poise and leadership. The Thunder also parted ways with speedy guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der, who was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers and sent Steven Adams \u2014 a player that was instrumental in establishing the team\u2019s culture \u2014 to New Orleans. The Schr\u00f6der and Paul trades took place within 24 hours of one another. The Thunder also lost veteran sharpshooter Danilo Gallinari in a sign-and-trade deal with Atlanta that landed them a conditional 2025 second-round pick. Gilgeous-Alexander and Dort are the only remaining starters returning for the upcoming season, and the team added some battle-tested vets in Al Horford, George Hill and Trevor Ariza along with promising newcomers such as 17 th pick Aleksej Pokusevski and French point guard Theo Maledon (34 th overall pick). Hill, Ariza, Horford, Darius Miller and Mike Muscala are the only players on the roster with more than three years of NBA experience. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander | 19.0 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 3.3 apg Wants the opportunity to be Oklahoma City\u2019s No. 1 option and will likely get it. Luguentz Dort | 6.8 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 0.8 apg Already a lockdown defender, he scored 30 points in Game 7 against the Rockets which means he\u2019s promising offensively, too. Trevor Ariza | 8.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 1.3 spg Family matters kept him out of the bubble and the early portion of OKC\u2019s training camp. Darius Bazley | 5.6 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 0.7 apg Dort overshadowed him, but let\u2019s not forget he became the first Thunder rookie since James Harden last season to score 20 points or more in three consecutive games. Al Horford | 11.9 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 4.0 apg Not a good fit alongside Joel Embiid in Philadelphia but could prove reliable in new role with a new team. George Hill | 9.4 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.1 apg Career 38.4% shooter from deep with enough skill and veteran savvy to crack the starting lineup. Mike Muscala | 4.8 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 0.9 apg Minutes were limited last season because of Adams and Nerlens Noel, but the big with 3-point range is now Horford\u2019s primary backup. Hamidou Diallo | 6.9 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 0.8 apg Third-year pro is now OKC\u2019s longest-tenured player. Oklahoma City Thunder, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The returners gained valuable postseason experience in the bubble, but there\u2019s just too much youth on this roster mixed with grizzled veterans on their last legs. You can expect the Thunder to take a major step back from their promising 2019-20 campaign in which they finished a surprising fifth in the West. OKC already has plenty of draft picks to work with moving forward, and it\u2019s likely the Thunder tack on a lottery pick at the end of 2020-21. Predicted finish: 29-43. *** Michael C.

The very next day, the NBA announced the suspension of the season due to the coronavirus pandemic. When the NBA finally announced plans for its restart inside the bubble at Walt Disney World, the Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the eight teams not invited because they weren\u2019t within six games of a postseason berth at the time play was suspended. What\u2019s new? The Timberwolves hope they\u2019ve added a third star in Georgia\u2019s Anthony Edwards to play alongside D\u2019Angelo Russell and Karl-Anthony Towns. There\u2019s a chance Edwards could start the season coming off the bench, but as the No. 1 overall pick of the Draft, he projects as Minnesota\u2019s starting small forward. The team reunited with point guard Ricky Rubio, a former Timberwolves lottery pick, who last played for the club from 2011-17, through a trade that also involved Oklahoma City and the New York Knicks. The Timberwolves bolstered those acquisitions by bringing aboard veteran big Ed Davis along with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, in addition to re-signing Malik Beasley and Juancho Hernangomez. The Wolves also acquired 28 th overall pick Jaden McDaniels from Oklahoma City in the trade that landed Rubio in exchange for the Draft rights to 17 th pick Aleksej Pokusevski and James Johnson. What\u2019s missing: There\u2019s a trio of solid, experienced veterans in Rubio, Russell and Towns. Rubio and Towns should have some built-in chemistry from their two seasons during the big man\u2019s first two years in the league, but will the veteran even start, considering Minnesota re-signed Beasley to a $60 million contract? Everything\u2019s not adding up there. On paper, it\u2019s easy to see Minnesota could potentially be explosive offensively. But let\u2019s not forget the Wolves ranked 20 th last season in defensive efficiency. The current roster features a surplus of wings in Edwards, Beasley, Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver, but Minnesota will likely experiment some at the thin power forward spot. They signed Hernangomez to a $21 million deal and brought in Davis. It\u2019s a position to keep an eye on because the Timberwolves might wind up playing lots of small ball. Could you imagine a lineup featuring Rubio, Russell, Beasley, Edwards and Towns? Ricky Rubio | 13 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 8.8 apg At 30, the Minnesota fan favorite contends he\u2019s entering prime of career. D\u2019Angelo Russell | 23.1 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 6.3 apg Expects the Rubio addition to provide some late-game relief. Anthony Edwards | (college statistics) 19.1 rpg, 5.2 rpg, 2.8 apg The fourth-youngest player of the incoming Draft class represents the third top-two pick in the starting lineup. Juancho Hernangomez | 6.0 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 0.8 apg Became a starter last February when Robert Covington was traded to Houston. Karl-Anthony Towns | 26.5 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 4.4 apg Surely pleased with the prospects of playmaking guards helping to spread the floor. Malik Beasley | 11.2 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 1.4 apg Probable starter averaged 20.7 points in 14 games with Minnesota last season after arriving from Denver via trade. Josh Okogie | 8.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 1.6 apg Young, inconsistent shooter should earn more minutes with his defensive skillset. Jarrett Culver | 9.3 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 1.7 apg High lottery pick last season still looking to develop his game. OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions They\u2019ll be better, and definitely fun to watch. But the truth is the grouping of Russell, Towns and Edwards could easily go a variety of ways over the course of a long NBA season. Minnesota hasn\u2019t been on the floor together since last March, and it will likely tip the season with two new starters, and one is a rookie. We\u2019ll see plenty of Timberwolves highlights this season, but we\u2019ll also probably see them right back in the Draft lottery.

Lillard was already playing through a dislocated left index finger suffered in Game 2, and you just knew at that point the magic was all but gone. Lillard had earned recognition as Kia NBA Player of the Seeding Games through a series of gutsy performances in which he averaged 37.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 9.6 assists in more than 40 minutes; basically carrying the Trail Blazers to the postseason after they entered the bubble sitting at ninth in the Western Conference standings. What\u2019s new? Portland traded Trevor Ariza and a couple of first-round picks to land Houston Rockets wing Robert Covington, who adds athleticism on defense and a reliable outside shooter capable of hitting open looks generated by Lillard and C.J. McCollum on drive-and-kicks. The Blazers also added depth in the frontcourt by trading for Enes Kanter, in addition to signing Derrick Jones Jr. and Harry Giles in free agency. Like Covington, Jones is versatile and boosts Portland\u2019s athleticism. Portland made sure to re-sign both Rodney Hood and Carmelo Anthony, too. Hood is coming off a season-ending Achilles injury suffered last December, but he was shooting 49.3% at the time of the injury. So, if Hood can return to form, Portland will benefit from the depth he and Anthony provide. What\u2019s missing: Portland\u2019s porous defense was its most significant weakness last season, and while it appears the Blazers worked to address those problems in the offseason, it\u2019s still unknown whether they did enough to make a real difference. On paper, it looks good. But remember Portland finished last season ranked No. 28, defensively. The addition of Covington and Jones should help, but Lillard and McCollum aren\u2019t known for locking down opponents on defense, which means opponents can and will still attack the Blazers\u2019 backcourt. Damian Lillard | 30.0 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 8.0 apg Entering Year 9 with all he\u2019s accomplished, the 30-year-old is still searching for ways to take the next step. C.J. McCollum | 22.2 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 4.4 apg Has vowed along with Lillard to improve defensively this season. Derrick Jones Jr. | 8.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.1 apg Expect a more significant role than you saw last season in Miami. Robert Covington | 12.4 ppg 6.6 rpg, 1.3 blk Won\u2019t be loaded down with as much responsibility as he had in Houston, and that should result in even more playmaking. Jusuf Nurkic | 17.6 ppg, 10.3 rpg, 2.0 blk Finally healthy after missing all of last season until the NBA restart in Orlando. Gary Trent Jr. | 8.9 ppg, 1.6 rpg, 1.0 apg Showed plenty of range last season (41.8% from 3-point range) while emerging as one of the breakout players of the bubble. Carmelo Anthony | 15.4 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.5 apg Accepted a reserve role for the upcoming season but will still contribute quality minutes. Enes Kanter | 8.1 ppg, 7.4 rbg, 1.0 apg Last stint in Portland led to a run in the 2019 Western Conference Finals. OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions We forget how much injuries slowed down Portland to start last season, not to mention the fact it benefitted from the NBA\u2019s hiatus due to the coronavirus, which allowed Nurkic and Zach Collins to become healthy enough to contribute to the Trail Blazers\u2019 leaky defense. Add up their improved health with the offseason acquisitions of Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. in free agency. Toss in the new commitment to improvement on the defensive end from Lillard and McCollum, and we just might be working with something going into 2020-21. Portland improved its versatility and athleticism, which is a must in the rugged Western Conference. The Blazers should be in the mix for a postseason berth, but they\u2019re still not talented enough to go toe-to-toe with the conference\u2019s elite teams. Predicted finish: 42-30 * * * Michael C.

But Donovan Mitchell set the basketball world on fire with his epic duel against Denver guard Jamal Murray. The teams combined to average nearly 235 points per game over the first six contests of the series, but Utah fell 80-78 in an old-school slugfest to become one of 12 teams in NBA history to lose a series in which it led 3-1. The disappointing end of the season left some to wonder whether chemistry issues had festered between stars Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, who found themselves at odds after becoming the first NBA players to test positive for COVID-19. What \u2019 s new? Utah drafted Kansas center Udoka Azubuike at No. 27, and then grabbed guard Elijah Hughes with the 39 th pick. Both could turn out to be decent rotational pieces, but it\u2019s clear the Jazz prioritized running things back in 2020-21 with virtually the same squad returning from last season. The Jazz signed Mitchell to a five-year extension in November, in addition to re-signing bench sparkplug Jordan Clarkson. Utah also brought back a familiar face in Derrick Favors, who spent nine years with the Jazz before they traded him last season to New Orleans. Favors produced his most productive seasons in Utah, averaging double digits in scoring in five of his last six seasons prior to joining the Pelicans. What \u2019 s missing: Pretty much the same things Utah lacked last season, as it didn\u2019t do much to address the issues it suffered with overall perimeter defense. We all saw what Jamal Murray did to the Jazz in the playoffs, and they didn\u2019t address that deficiency by adding a big, athletic defensive wing. Utah needed to improve its athleticism defensively to stick with all the talent in the West. But the Jazz prioritized the signings of Mitchell and Clarkson, while bringing in Favors to address the problems they fought through last season in the minutes that Gobert wasn\u2019t on the floor. Utah didn\u2019t do much to address depth on the bench either and probably could\u2019ve benefitted from having a third point guard with Emmanuel Mudiay out of the picture. Mike Conley | 14.4 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 4.4 apg Needs a better start this season, after struggling early in his first year with the Jazz. Donovan Mitchell | 24.0 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 4.3 apg Led the league in scoring during the postseason, averaging 36.3 ppg while shooting 52.9% overall and 51.6% on 3-pointers. Bojan Bogdanovic | 20.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 2.1 apg Wrist surgery in May cut short his first season in Utah, but he\u2019s trending toward a healthy return. Royce O\u2019Neale | 6.3 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 2.5 apg Said he still thinks about the first-round loss to Denver \u201cevery day.\u201d Rudy Gobert | 15.1 ppg, 13.5 rpg, 2.0 bpg The former two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year is up for a new deal and says, \u201cthis year is going to be my best.\u201d Jordan Clarkson | 15.6 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 1.6 apg Instant offense off the bench, Clarkson might also alleviate depth problems at the point guard spot. Joe Ingles | 9.8 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 5.2 apg Will wreak havoc with Favors running the pick-and-roll with the second unit. Derrick Favors | 9.0 ppg, 9.8 rpg, 1.6 apg Based off his performance last season in New Orleans, should play a valuable role improving Utah\u2019s second-unit defense at the rim. Utah Jazz, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The return of a healthy Bogdanovic helps, but Utah didn\u2019t do enough in the offseason to keep pace with all the contenders in the West. The Jazz can\u2019t run with the Lakers, Nuggets, Clippers or any of the other real contenders in their division. They\u2019ll challenge for a postseason spot. But that\u2019s what they do virtually every year. They simply don\u2019t possess enough firepower on the roster to make a deep run in the playoffs. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Utah handles negotiations on a new deal for Gobert because that will go a long way in determining whether the Jazz are committed to building a future around both he and Mitchell.

But, they were simultaneously hopeful about the future having witnessed Jamal Murray blossom into a full-blown star in the postseason while rookie Michael Porter Jr. stepped into a more prominent role where he should thrive for years to come. Denver became the first team in NBA postseason history to bounce back from two 3-1 deficits in the same playoffs with wins over Utah and the LA Clippers in the first two rounds. Doing so left the Nuggets sapped for their first conference finals run since the 2008-09 season. Denver\u2019s surprising run in the NBA bubble set high expectations for 2020-21 for this young, ascending team that might be a serious contender for the next several years. What \u2019 s new? The Draft seems to be where Denver has shined the most in recent years, grabbing Michael Porter Jr. \u2014 once projected as the potential No. 1 pick \u2014 14 th overall in 2018, then selecting Bol Bol in 2019 at No. 44. The Nuggets grabbed a couple more potential gems this year, taking Zeke Nnaji with the No. 22 pick and RJ Hampton at No. 24. Neither will likely make much impact as rookies with Hampton expected to back up Gary Harris and Nnaji sits behind Nikola Jokic and Isaiah Hartenstein. But both rookies could play more than expected due to the pandemic. Denver also grabbed veteran free agent JaMychal Green, who should contribute in the rotation immediately as a defender, as well as 29-year old rookie Facundo Campazzo, who averaged 10.1 points and 5.5 assists last season in the Euroleague for Real Madrid. The Nuggets lost some size in free agency, and coach Michael Malone has already said the staff might need to become more creative this offseason with the defensive schematics to compensate. What \u2019 s missing: The Nuggets lost three of their best defenders Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig and Mason Plumlee through free agency and were unable to make up for those departures through free agency and the Draft. Adding Green helped some, but not enough. That\u2019s why Malone is considering experimenting more with zone defenses with Bol Bol taking on a role as the backline to work as more of a shot blocker. Malone expressed confidence in the current incarnation of the Nuggets playing well defensively, despite all the losses. Malone pointed to Harris as one of the NBA\u2019s better perimeter defenders, while also mentioning that Murray showed major signs of defensive improvement in the bubble. Jamal Murray | 18.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 4.8 apg The numbers above increased significantly last season in the postseason (26.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 6.6 apg) for a young star expected to bump up the production on defense. Gary Harris | 10.4 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 2.1 apg Efficiency and production have been down over the last few years due to injuries, leaving many to wonder whether he\u2019ll return to form. Michael Porter Jr. | 9.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 0.8 apg Potentially the team\u2019s third star with Nuggets president Tim Connelly saying he needs to \u201ctake the next step\u201d this season. Paul Millsap | 11.6 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Claiming he wasn\u2019t himself in the NBA bubble, Millsap re-signed for one year hoping for redemption. Nikola Jokic | 19.9 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 7.0 apg First conference finals and 19-game postseason run provided \u201cexperience\u201d that \u201cis going to be the most important key\u201d this season. Will Barton | 15.1 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 3.7 apg Still views himself as a starter after knee injury forced him out of the bubble. Monte Morris | 9.0 ppg, 1.9 rpg, 3.5 apg The organization rewarded reliability with a three-year extension worth $27 million. JaMychal Green | 6.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 0.8 apg Impressed by Denver\u2019s tenacity fighting a 3-1 deficit, the former Clipper decided to sign on and assume some of Jerami Grant\u2019s old role. Denver Nuggets, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The 2020 bubble odyssey only enhanced Denver\u2019s confidence and experience, and there\u2019s a legitimate chance that Porter turns out to be the Nuggets\u2019 third star. His next steps affect the prospects for several players this season, with Denver also looking to mitigate losses on the defensive end from the departures of Plumlee, Craig and Grant. Most pundits won\u2019t favor the Nuggets in the ultra-competitive West, but it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll be right there in the mix when the dust clears if Porter shines in his new role, Jokic and Murray continue their production and key reserves such as Barton, Morris, and Green remain reliable contributors.

The Kings always seem to be under construction and in that sense, nothing changed last season, their first under coach Luke Walton. While De\u2019Aaron Fox showed more growth and maturity at point guard, that was the biggest plus for Sacramento. Buddy Hield did average 19.2 points and has made more 3-pointers in his first four years than anyone in league history. He also pouted when asked to come off the bench in favor of the departed Bogdan Bogdanovic. Also, Marvin Bagley III once again dealt with injuries, playing only 13 games and leaving the Kings at a disadvantage near the rim. The Kings traveled down a well-worn path to the Draft lottery and then braced for changes within and beyond the roster. What \u2019 s new? Monte McNair was hired to replace Vlade Divac as general manager, a swap that was overdue. Divac lorded over a post-DeMarcus Cousins era that never gained any traction and couldn\u2019t hire a coach with staying power. His biggest crime, however, was bypassing Luka Doncic in the draft for Bagley. McNair\u2019s first big decision was allowing Bogdanovic to bolt to the Hawks in free agency without matching the offer sheet. If nothing else, it at least made Hield happy even if an asset walked out the door with nothing in return. McNair also drafted combo guard Tyrese Haliburton from Iowa State and signed Hassan Whiteside and Frank Kaminski on the cheap for front-line depth and experience. What \u2019 s missing: The Kings are an unbalanced team, with most of their energy generated from the backcourt, although this could change if Bagley stays healthy and develops. Harrison Barnes, a solid player at small forward but never a star, could begin to decline, and that could force the Kings to examine trade possibilities provided there\u2019s a taker for his contract. A defensive presence at the rim would be beneficial for Sacramento, and Whiteside has been one of the league\u2019s premier rebounders and shot blockers the last few years. But there\u2019s a reason why nobody wanted him, even for the minimum \u2014 he\u2019s severely lacking intangibles. Hopefully for the sake of the Kings and his career, this is his wakeup call. De\u2019Aaron Fox | 21.1 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 6.8 apg Freshly signed to a max deal, Fox looks to make a push toward All-Stardom. Buddy Hield | 19.2 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 3.0 apg A solid volume 3-point shooter searches for happiness and a long-time home in Sactown. Marvin Bagley III | 14.2 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 0.9 bpg Injuries have restricted his development and because of that, he\u2019s somewhat a mystery. Harrison Barnes | 14.5 pgg, 4.9 rpg, 2.2 apg Steady and dependable veteran has already reached his ceiling. Richaun Holmes | 12.3 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 1.3 bpg Worker bee has been a pleasant surprise but faces a threat from bigger Hassan Whiteside. Tyrese Haliburton | 15.2 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 6.5 apg (Iowa State) Multi-skilled combo guard brings an all-around game and an odd shooting motion. Nemanja Bjelica | 11.5 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.8 apg Very productive per-minute player who flourished in Bagley\u2019s absence last season. Hassan Whiteside | 15.5 ppg, 13.5 rpg, 2.9 bpg Perhaps no one with comparable stats has taken a bigger pay cut in NBA history. Sacramento Kings, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Kings haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2006 and haven\u2019t won a playoff series since 2004. That\u2019s a lengthy drought for a team constantly choosing high in the Draft, yet failing to stockpile enough talent to bring a halt to the misery. Once again, with the West loaded with quality teams, the Kings will be fortunate to make any noise in that regard. The hope is that Haliburton gives them yet another young and talented guard to pair with Fox in the backcourt, and that Bagley stays healthy enough to give the Kings a better idea about how he fits.

Their surprising stay in the Orlando restart did not result in a playoff appearance but they departed with good vibes nonetheless. Two individuals in particular saw their status soar in that 8-0 stretch: Devin Booker and coach Monty Williams. Booker played exceptionally well, while the Suns were prepared and motivated to finish strong by their first-year coach. Before the restart, they were 13 games under .500 and dealt with the usual growing pains of a team in transition under new direction and leadership. Ricky Rubio, Aron Baynes and Kelly Oubre were helpful, especially after Deandre Ayton served a suspension for a positive test of performance enhancing substances. In the end, Booker failed to make the playoffs again \u2014 he\u2019s never done so in his six-year career \u2014 and the Suns went home early. What \u2019 s new? Hello, Chris Paul. The generational point guard will play for this third team in three years and yet in some ways this stop could prove as beneficial or more than those in Houston and Oklahoma City. Paul should be an ideal fit next to Booker, giving the Suns a dangerous backcourt of playmaking, passing and scoring. Paul is 35 but is defying age and had one of his more impactful seasons with the Thunder, taking that franchise to the playoffs and further than expected. The Suns also signed Jae Crowder, who brings decent 3-point shooting and a physical presence on the wing. Those additions will put the Suns in the conversation for a top-eight spot and raise hopes for a franchise that has spent the last decade on a treadmill to nowhere. What \u2019 s missing: The Suns surrendered Oubre and Rubio for Paul, although those subtractions can be overcome. It depends on Cameron Payne\u2019s ability to supply backup minutes to Paul, and also the development of Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges at the forward positions. And then there\u2019s Ayton. The big man may never prove that the Suns made the right decision drafting him over Luka Doncic, but needs to take another step toward being a worthy pick-and-roll option and low-post presence. Phoenix needs to be better on D as it hasn\u2019t been top-10 defensively in 18 years. Chris Paul | 17.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 6.7 apg Still a top-tier point guard at age 35 and capable of uplifting a team, as he showed in OKC. Devin Booker | 26.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 4.2 apg Elite scorer no longer is overloaded with playmaking chores and therefore should soar. Deandre Ayton | 18.2 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 1.5 bpg A double-double talent looks to refine his game and make more of an impact. Cam Johnson | 9.2 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 8.0 apg An ace shooter should see a minutes increase and a chance to quicken his development. Dario Saric | 10.7 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 1.9 apg Good utility player who blends well and brings consistency. Mikal Bridges | 9.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 1.8 apg He could be in position to start; nonetheless he\u2019ll see increased playing time and a role. Jae Crowder | 10.5 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 2.5 apg Durable floor-stretcher who is streaky with the 3-point shot but does defend well. Cameron Payne | 10.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 3.0 apg Will look to squeeze some minutes while competing with Jevon Carter for backup time. Phoenix Suns, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Suns are bringing an elite backcourt with amazing passing and creativity which alone can be the element that, at the very least, puts them in a play-in situation for a playoff spot. And really, the postseason is the next step for a franchise that hasn\u2019t been there since 2010, the second-longest stretch in the NBA. Paul worked wonders for a young OKC team in his only season there and the Suns are hoping for much of the same leadership and impact. Yet it\u2019s not all about him. This is a \u201cnext step\u201d team that\u2019s positioned to take one, especially if Booker is ready to be a big star.

It was a devastating, embarrassing second-round exit by a team considered a strong title favorite, one made possible by poor shooting from Paul George, disappointing play from bench stars Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams and ultimately a weak response when times got tough in the bubble. Actually, the Clippers never developed continuity all season because of injuries and Kawhi Leonard\u2019s load management. It cost Doc Rivers his job and caused the franchise to conduct some intense soul searching. Once again, even with the addition of George and Leonard the previous summer, the Clippers had to deal with dogged demons and a stigma that always seems to haunt the franchise, no matter the circumstances. What \u2019 s new? The trade for George in the summer of 2019 cost the Clippers a bevy of Draft picks and other assets, so they weren\u2019t dealing from a position of strength this offseason when searching for change. Still, they managed quite well, given the handcuffs. The only questionable subtraction was their refusal to keep Harrell, who bolted for the Lakers in free agency. To offset the loss of the Sixth Man Award winner, the Clippers signed Serge Ibaka. They also swung a deal for Pistons swingman Luke Kennard. Plus, Marcus Morris signed an extension; he was one of the few bright spots in the playoffs. And finally, Ty Lue was elevated from top assistant to replace Rivers. Lue is a respected voice in the locker room. What \u2019 s missing: The glaring need for a creative point guard was never addressed in the offseason. Patrick Beverley is known for defense, not for his playmaking. Because of that, the Clippers will rely heavily on Leonard and George to handle the ball and create shots for teammates, though Kennard can help in that area. Also, the only low-post option is Ivica Zubac, the young center who made reasonable strides last season. It\u2019s possible the Clippers could add a piece or two during the season to satisfy one or both of those needs. Kawhi Leonard | 27.1 ppg, 7.1 rbg, 4.9 apg You wonder if one of the game\u2019s greatest two-way players will still require nights off. Paul George | 21.5 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 3.9 apg A consistent star must overcome a shocking collapse in the bubble and restore his image. Ivica Zubac | 8.3 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 0.9 blk Developing big man had moments last season and always comes to work. Serge Ibaka | 15.4 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 1.4 apg Solid and consistent, he can play both power positions and also guard multiple positions. Patrick Beverley | 7.9 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 3.6 apg Veteran remains a solid defender but offers little pure point guard skills. Luke Kennard | 15.8 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 4.1 apg Versatile swingman should enhance LA\u2019s outside shooting and some of the playmaking. Marcus Morris | 10.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 1.4 apg Emerged as a reliable shooter in the playoffs and serves as team enforcer when necessary. Lou Williams | 18.2 ppg 3.1 rpg, 5.6 apg Delivered another stellar season as sixth man before disappearing in the playoffs. The Clippers will feel the pinch of desperation because of the pending free agency of George and Leonard next summer. It\u2019s yet another win-now situation for a club that must make up for the haunting experience of the bubble. The good news is, health permitting, the Clippers have star power and depth for a deep run; Ibaka and Kennard were positive additions. Still, it\u2019s crowded at the top in the West and the Clippers will be pressed to produce better than last season. Predicted finish: 51-21. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

When last seen, the Lakers were \u2026 dancing around the floor under a rain of purple and gold confetti in the bubble. The celebration of the franchise\u2019s 17th championship took place inside a sealed-off arena in Orlando because of the coronavirus pandemic, but that was the only surprising part of the title run. Otherwise, the Lakers had too much LeBron James and Anthony Davis for anyone to handle in the revamped playoffs. The two superstars stayed healthy, first and foremost, and delivered the high-level performances expected of them. Along with a solid supporting cast and the defense-first philosophy demanded by coach Frank Vogel, the Lakers enjoyed a triumphant return to glory months after the tragic death of Kobe Bryant. What \u2019 s new? Well, plenty. Championship teams rarely change much from one year to the next because there\u2019s a tendency in sports to run it back. But the Lakers roster was always built on flexibility and the club offered only short-term contracts to the supporting cast to enable L.A. to upgrade if necessary. And so out goes JaVale McGee, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard and Danny Green and in comes Montrezl Harrell, Dennis Schroder, Marc Gasol and Wesley Matthews. By almost every metric, the Lakers improved their shooting (Matthews), creativity (Schroder), floor spacing (Gasol) and pick-and-roll presence (Harrell). This is win-win for the team coming off the season\u2019s biggest win. What \u2019 s missing: Other than Davis, who\u2019s the interior defender? Sure, Gasol was a premier player in that regard once upon a time, but he\u2019s showing some age and losing some speed. And maybe the Lakers will miss Rondo\u2019s passing because Schroder is a scoring point guard. Seriously, though, this is nit-picking. LeBron and Davis are good enough to mask plenty of flaws on both ends, and the Lakers as constructed simply don\u2019t have any glaring weaknesses. LeBron James | 25.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 10.2 apg The game\u2019s greatest active player defies age while building a GOAT case. Anthony Davis | 26.1 ppg, 9.3 rpg, 2.3 bpg His impact at both ends is steep and unreachable by anyone except Giannis Antetokounmpo. Dennis Schroder | 18.9 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 4.0 apg An elite finisher at the rim and solid creator will reduce LeBron\u2019s ball dependency. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope | 9.3 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 1.6 apg Aggressive combo guard had big moments under pressure in the NBA Finals. Marc Gasol | 7.5 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 3.3 apg Coming off his worst season but can still space the floor, pass from the high post and defend bigs. Montrezl Harrell | 18.6 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 1.1 bpg The reigning Kia Sixth Man Award winner brings energy and fire yet lags defensively. Kyle Kuzma | 12.8 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.3 apg Struggled through a disappointing year and needs a bounce-back, or else. Wesley Matthews | 7.4 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 1.4 apg Catch-and-shooter hopes to feast on open looks with two stars on the floor.  L.A. Lakers, last 5 seasons OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions The Lakers have a new supporting cast and in these situations there\u2019s usually a call for patience. That\u2019s understandable in most cases. The difference here is LeBron\u2019s passing will accelerate that process with new teammates and Davis is prepared to take the lead role on most nights. Because their offseason was so short, expect some nights off for Davis and LeBron. Still, the Lakers should return to the role of title favorite because the quality of their depth is superior than a year ago.

The former Kia NBA MVP and four-time scoring champion suited up Sunday for his \u201cnew\u201d team, the Brooklyn Nets, whom he joined via sign-and-trade all the way back in July 2019, mere weeks after tearing his Achilles tendon with the Golden State Warriors in Game 5 of The Finals. The catastrophic injury forced Durant sit out the entire 2019-20 season, lengthy hiatus and all. In addition to his monstrous salary, it was a price the Nets were more than willing to pay in order to land a player with the sixth highest scoring average in NBA history at 27.02 points per game. Brooklyn\u2019s preseason opener against Washington also saw the return of Durant\u2019s fellow superstar, Kyrie Irving, who missed all but 20 games of last season with a variety of injuries including a shoulder impingement that required surgery. The Nets hoped the tandem could elevate them to serious championship contention, and for at least one preseason game those expectations looked well-founded. Durant wasted little time getting to work, blowing past a closeout at the 3-point line to dunk for the game\u2019s first points. It was the start of an impressive first quarter for him and Irving, who scored nine and 12 points, respectively, as the Nets raced out to a 38-20 lead. The two played only sparingly after that, with Durant finishing with 15 points in 24 minutes and Irving totaling 18 in 17. But even after squandering a 26-point lead \u2014 the Nets recovered to win 119-114 \u2014 that modest taste of Brooklyn\u2019s healthy star tandem was more than enough to whet appetites around the NBA.  \u201cIt felt great to be back in the routine and be back on the floor and feel like a player again,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt felt great. Everybody\u2019s texting and calling and asking me how I\u2019m feeling. I can\u2019t wait until that\u2019s over with so I can get back in the swing of things and just feel like one of the guys again.\u201d Said head coach Steve Nash, also making his preseason Nets debut, \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to come back and look as explosive and mobile and skillful as he has after a long layoff.

The NBA preseason \u2014 a truncated 49-game, nine-day sprint \u2014 opened Friday with a five-game slate, action returning to NBA arenas for the first time in exactly nine months. Coaches debuted with their new teams: Stephen Silas with Houston, Tom Thibodeau with New York, Billy Donovan with Chicago and Tyronn Lue with the Los Angeles Clippers. Rookies, such as No. 4 pick Patrick Williams of the Bulls and No. 8 pick Obi Toppin of the Knicks, got their first NBA minutes. As will be the case in most buildings, at least to start the season, almost nobody was at any of these games. With the coronavirus pandemic ongoing and case numbers still rising, the era that started for the NBA with the suspension of last season on March 11 \u2014 the night that Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert tested positive \u2014 resumed with the league and its teams erring on the sides of caution and safety. \u201cIt\u2019s different, for sure,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said before his team faced the Clippers inside a very empty Staples Center. Well, some things were different. Coaches wore masks. Detroit showed old videos of actual fan interactions \u2014 with the disclaimer that they were taped previously \u2014 during some timeouts. Bench seating areas were all spaced out, nobody next to one another. \u201cThe atmosphere will be obviously significantly different than what guys are used to in an arena,\u201d Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to be one of the valuable aspects of playing these four exhibition games. Just like in the bubble, we had to get used to a different-type environment and I think these four games will hopefully allow us to see what the regular season is going to be like in these big arenas also.\u201d So, yes, much was different. Other things \u2014 like Wall\u2019s explosion to the basket \u2014 were just like normal. Wall\u2019s first basket since December 2018 came on the first possession of Houston\u2019s preseason, when he got to the rim for an easy score in his Rockets debut, one that came after his recovery from heel and Achilles injuries. The Rockets\u2019 next basket? Wall set up Cousins for a 3-pointer, the center\u2019s first basket since Game 6 of the 2019 finals with the Warriors, two months before he tore his ACL and missed last season. Reigning NBA scoring champion James Harden wasn\u2019t playing for the Rockets, still not cleared to be back on the floor with the team that he hasn\u2019t practiced with yet and apparently no longer wants to be with. LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who were last seen on the floor together when the Lakers topped the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in the Walt Disney World bubble \u2014 less than two months ago \u2014 were among the regulars who got the champs\u2019 preseason opener off."},{"id":441962,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-wall-demarcus-cousins-make-successful-preseason-returns-with-rockets","date":"2020-12-12","title":"John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins make encouraging preseason returns with Rockets","content":"John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins were top-five picks in the same Draft class, unquestionable talents that made their perennial All-NBA futures seem a matter of not just when, but how long. Instead, their respective rising stars were cut short by cruel injury luck. Friday hinted that their luck might finally be about to change . Wall and Cousins formed two-fifths of Houston\u2019s revamped starting lineup in their preseason opener against Chicago. Both former All-Stars appeared spry considering their forced time away from the game, playing significant roles in the Rockets\u2019 125-104 victory. Wall, acquired in a trade that sent All-NBA guard Russell Westbrook to Washington, finished with 13 points, nine assists, five rebounds and two steals in just under 19 minutes of action. The former No. 1 overall pick was a plus-27 in his time on the court while flashing his familiar flair for attacking the basket. Wall, who has undergone knee, foot and Achilles surgeries, has not played a regular-season game since Dec. 26, 2018. Cousins, meanwhile, showed both range and activity in under 15 minutes played, putting up 14 points, five rebounds, two blocks and two steals. The four-time All-Star drilled three of his four attempts from 3-point range while also showing active hands on the defensive end. Cousins did not play last season after suffering a torn ACL during a preseason workout with the Lakers. A torn quadriceps and ruptured Achilles\u2019 also severely shortened his previous two seasons. Wall and Cousins\u2019 respective impacts could play an even larger role for Houston depending on the future of James Harden. The perennial Kia MVP candidate has reportedly requested a trade after spending the last eight seasons with the Rockets. Harden reported late to Houston\u2019s training camp and is undergoing the league\u2019s COVID-19 safety protocol before returning to action."},{"id":440415,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-league-pass-game-watch-guide-2020-21-season-first-half","date":"2020-12-11","title":"NBA League Pass Game Watch Guide: 2020-21 Season First Half","content":"2019 No. 1 and 2 overall picks Zion Williamson and Ja Morant have already established themselves as impact players. Amazing moments occur on a nightly basis across the NBA. From jaw-dropping dunks to no-look dimes and buzzer-beating game-winning shots, you never know which game is going to turn into an instant classic. With NBA League Pass you won\u2019t miss any of the action. To help get you ready for the season, here are 20 must-see games from the first half of the 2020-21 season schedule that are available on NBA League Pass. While the 2020-21 NBA season tips off on Dec. 22 with a TNT doubleheader, opening night for most of the league will take place the following night during a packed 13-game slate. Here are some notable games to keep an eye on to get us started: Washington Wizards at Philadelphia 76ers (7 ET) In a blockbuster deal, the Wizards and Rockets swapped point guards, with John Wall headed to Houston and Russell Westbrook coming to D.C. We get our first glimpse of the Westbrook-Bradley Beal backcourt as the Wizards take on a Sixers squad marking their first game under new head coach Doc Rivers. Charlotte Hornets at Cleveland Cavaliers (7 ET)  No. 3 overall pick LaMelo Ball makes his NBA debut as the Hornets take on the Cavaliers in Cleveland. Ball is one of the most intriguing rookies in this year\u2019s class, having played in Lithuania and Australia over the past two years after forgoing college hoops. How will his game translate to the NBA? We\u2019ll get our first assessment against the Cavs. New Orleans Pelicans at Toronto Raptors (7:30 ET)  Not only do we get to see the second-year debut of last year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, but we get our first look at the newest (temporary) NBA city as the Raptors are set to play their \u201chome\u201d games this season in Tampa, Florida due to COVID-19 travel restrictions that have limited international travel to and from Canada. Detroit Pistons at Minnesota Timberwolves (8 ET)  The No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, Anthony Edwards, makes his NBA debut as the Timberwolves host the Pistons. Edwards joins a Minnesota squad anchored by Karl-Anthony Towns and D\u2019Angelo Russell as they look to leap forward after last season\u2019s 19-45 campaign. Oklahoma City Thunder at Houston Rockets (8 ET) We mentioned the Westbrook-Wall trade earlier and here we get a look at the other end of that deal, with John Wall making his Rockets debut. This will be Wall\u2019s first NBA game in nearly two calendar years \u2014 he last played an NBA game on Dec. 26, 2018 before missing much of the past two seasons due to injury. Combining a healthy Wall with the reigning back-to-back-to-back NBA scoring champion James Harden should make the Rockets fun to watch. LA Clippers at Phoenix Suns (8 ET)  The Suns acquiring Chris Paul from the Oklahoma City Thunder easily ranked as one of the offseason\u2019s biggest moves. The savvy veteran point guard joins a young Suns squad that was one of the breakout stories of the NBA restart in Orlando \u2014 going a perfect 8-0 in the bubble \u2014 even as they still came up just short of qualifying for the Western Conference Play-In Tournament. Adding Paul to the mix should lift Phoenix\u2019s chances of ending their 10-year playoff drought. This matchup with the Clippers will be a good early test for the Suns. And while Paul spent six seasons in L.A. from 2011-17, this squad looks nothing like the team he left three seasons ago. Boston Celtics at Toronto Raptors (7:30 ET)  This is a rematch of last year\u2019s Eastern Conference semifinal series, which went the full seven games as the Celtics prevailed to end the Raptors\u2019 title defense. Five of the seven games were decided by seven points or less. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with averages of 24.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in the series and had a game-high 29 points in the Game 7 clincher. Los Angeles Lakers at Houston Rockets (7 ET)  The Rockets were the only Western Conference team to win the season series against the Lakers last season, taking two of three games. James Harden averaged 29.0 points, 8.7 assists and 7.0 rebounds in those three regular-season matchups, while LeBron James and Anthony Davis each averaged 24.5 points while appearing in two of the three. Utah Jazz at Denver Nuggets (8:00 ET) Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell\u2019s first-round duel was an instant classic. Jamal Murray vs. Donovan Mitchell. The two young stars guards held an epic duel in the opening round of the 2020 playoffs, with Murray and the Nuggets rallying from a 3-1 deficit to defeat the Jazz in seven games. Mitchell (254) and Murray (221) combined to score 475 points in the series, passing John Havlicek and Jerry West (463 in the 1969 Finals) for the most points ever scored by a pair of opponents in a playoff series. Memphis Grizzlies at Portland Trail Blazers (10 ET)  This is a rematch of last year\u2019s Western Conference Play-In, which determined the No. 8 seed in the West. At the conclusion of the regular season, the Blazers held the No. 8 position, so they only needed to beat the No. 9 Grizzlies once in order to secure the spot. Damian Lillard (31) and CJ McCollum (29) combined for 60 points to lead the Blazers to a 126-122 victory; they advanced to the playoffs and an ultimately short-lived first-round meeting with the eventual-champion Lakers. Dallas Mavericks at San Antonio Spurs (8:30 ET) It\u2019s an all-Texas affair as Luka Doncic and the Mavericks take on DeMar DeRozan and the Spurs. Doncic led the NBA with 17 triple-doubles last season. Two of those came against the Spurs, including a 40-point triple-double in a Nov. 18 win. Doncic averaged 32.5 points, 10.5 assists and 9.5 rebounds in four games against San Antonio as the Mavs won the season series, 3-1. Sacramento Kings at Memphis Grizzlies (8 ET)  While the biggest track meets of the year won\u2019t happen until the rescheduled Summer Olympics in Japan, the NBA will offer its own version of a track meet with two of the fastest young players in the game \u2014 Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox and Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant \u2014 facing off on this Sunday evening. Both point guards are the centerpiece of their respective franchises, with Morant is coming off a spectacular Kia Rookie of the Year season and Fox having locked up a max extension with the Kings. Los Angeles Lakers at Cleveland Cavaliers (7:30 ET)  It\u2019s always special when LeBron James returns to Cleveland. He spent his first seven seasons in Cleveland before leaving for a four-year stint in Miami. He returned for a four-year run that included four straight Finals appearances and the Cavaliers\u2019 only NBA championship (2016). He returns to Cleveland as a defending champion after leading the Lakers to the 2020 title and becoming the first player to win Finals MVP for three different teams. Brooklyn Nets at Oklahoma City Thunder (8 ET) Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving face high expectations in Brooklyn. Kevin Durant returns to Oklahoma City for the first time as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Durant spent the first nine seasons of his career with the Seattle\/OKC franchise and won the 2014 Kia NBA MVP award as a member of the Thunder. Following a three-year run in Golden State, Durant signed with Brooklyn in 2019 \u2026 but missed the entire 2019-20 season due to a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon. How will he look after a full month of games in this comeback season? Philadelphia 76ers at Indiana Pacers (5 ET)  TJ Warren was one of the breakout players from the NBA restart in Orlando: he was the third-leading scorer in the league during the eight seeding games, racking up an average of 31.5 ppg. That average was bolstered most by a career-high 53-point performance against the Sixers on August 1. Warren finished his first season in Indiana (and sixth in the league) scoring a career-best 19.8 ppg. Was his performance in the bubble the precursor for a big 2020-21 season? Dallas Mavericks at Atlanta Hawks (7:30 ET) Luka Doncic vs. Trae Young. The two young stars will forever be tied thanks to the Draft-night trade that landed them in their respective cities. Moreover, Young and Doncic are two of the most dynamic young players in the game today as they finished last season fourth and sixth, respectively, in NBA scoring and second and third, respectively, in assists \u2026 in just their second season. Memphis Grizzlies at New Orleans Pelicans (7 ET)  It is a matchup of the top two picks in the 2019 draft \u2014 No. 1 Zion Williamson of New Orleans and No. 2 Ja Morant of Memphis. That order is flipped when it came to Kia Rookie of the Year voting asMorant edged out Williamson after he was limited to just 24 games due to injury. Both players enter the 2020-21 season with a clean bill of health and an ability to create a season-shaking highlight at any given moment. Portland Trail Blazers at Dallas Mavericks (3:30 ET) Damian Lillard\u2019s spectacular 2019-20 campaign earned him a fifth All-NBA nod. While this may be Valentine\u2019s Day, don\u2019t expect the Mavericks to offer any love notes to Damian Lillard \u2014 the Blazers\u2019 star torched the Mavericks last season. With an average of 42.5 points and 7.8 assists over four games, Lillard notably matched his career-high with a 61-point performance against Dallas on August 11 during the restart. The Blazers and Mavericks split their season series last year, with all four games decided by eight points or less. Friday, February 10, 2021 Phoenix Suns at New Orleans Pelicans (8 ET)  The Phoenix Suns have been a League Pass favorite over the past few seasons thanks in large part to the play of young star Devin Booker. Back in 2017, Booker ignited one of the era\u2019s biggest #LeaguePassAlert moments when he became just the sixth \u2014 and youngest \u2014 player in NBA history to score 70 points in an NBA game. Booker\u2019s season-high from 2019-20 was 44 against the Pelicans back in November. Between Booker, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, this matchup features some of the top young talents in the league. Denver Nuggets at Milwaukee Bucks (8 ET) This game features a matchup of two of the league\u2019s unique talents \u2014 reigning back-to-back Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks and Nikola Jokic of the Nuggets. Antetokounmpo has a combination of size, speed, power and athleticism that has earned him \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d nickname as he pulls down rebounds, goes coast-to-coast and dunks on anyone in his path. In Jokic, you have a 7-footer that ranks as one of the game\u2019s top playmakers, dropping dimes to his teammates or knocking down shots in unorthodox ways. Both players have a fascinating ability to dominate a game in very different ways."},{"id":440446,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-brooklyn-nets-fined-for-violating-league-media-access-rules","date":"2020-12-11","title":"Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets fined for violating league media access rules","content":"Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving and the Nets organization have each been fined $25,000 for violating league rules governing media interview access, the NBA announced, Thursday.

Warren out of Pacers' season opener","content":"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Indiana Pacers could open this season without forward T.J. Warren, their top scorer from last season. The team said Thursday that Warren has plantar fasciitis in his right foot and will be listed as week to week. It\u2019s the same injury that kept All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis from returning to action in the NBA\u2019s bubble last August. Indiana also will be without backup guard Brian Bowen II for 6-8 weeks because of a partially torn groin muscle. Warren\u2019s injury could be more detrimental. Last season, he scored 19.8 points while shooting 53.6% from the field \u2014 both career-highs. And in the bubble, Warren was spectacular, averaging 31.0 points in six games including a 53-point game against Philadelphia to tie the team\u2019s single-game scoring record. \u201cHe\u2019s just a sneaky scorer and we\u2019ve got to take advantage of that,\u201d president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said two weeks ago. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to play him at the four. Last time, I checked when he played the four, he was nearly unstoppable. So I imagine he\u2019ll play at the four some this year, too.\u201d While the Pacers remain hopeful Warren will be healthy enough to start the season opener Dec. 23 against the New York Knicks, he almost certainly will miss some or all of Indiana\u2019s three preseason games. And when Warren does return, the Pacers could limit his playing time. Last season, two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo missed the first 3 1\/2 months as he recovered from a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee. Oladipo said he\u2019s completely healthy this year. \u201cI would say it\u2019s night and day,\u201d Oladipo said last week. \u201cI feel a lot better, a lot stronger. There\u2019s always room for improvement. But I feel better now, even since the bubble. I feel like I\u2019ve made some pretty drastic improvements, I\u2019ve just got to keep trending forward.\u201d Sabonis also said he\u2019s ready to play though the Pacers may play it safe with him, too. Bowen spent most of his rookie season in the G-League, playing only six games with Indiana."},{"id":440223,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-wall-ready-for-preseason-debut","date":"2020-12-10","title":"Rockets' John Wall ready for first NBA action in 2 years","content":"John Wall entered the room wearing sunglasses, but quickly slid off his cool Thursday in admitting Houston\u2019s preseason opener at Chicago on Friday is more than just a typical exhibition contest. Wall, 30, hasn\u2019t played since Dec. 26, 2018, missing the last two seasons with injuries to his left Achilles tendon, left knee and left heel. It goes deeper, according to Wall, who said he\u2019s finally pain free, after pushing for more than five years through the agony of bone spurs in his left heel that siphoned away his athleticism. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a lot of anxiousness and a lot of excitement to step on that floor when the jumpball goes up,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBut once the ball touches my hands one time, it\u2019s over with. Now, it\u2019s play basketball, get out there and try to have fun, and just try to get better as much as [we] possibly can as a group. That\u2019s all I can do and enjoy this new journey I have with my new team in a new city.\u201d The old trek came with plenty of frustration for the five-time NBA All-Star. Almost 11 months before his last NBA game, Wall underwent a clean-up procedure on his left knee. Then, three days after his Dec. 26, 2018 outing, Wall visited with a specialist regarding recurring pain in his left heel. Ultimately, Wall opted for surgery to alleviate that discomfort. Weeks later, Wall would suffer another setback when rupturing his left Achilles tendon after a slip and fall at home. Wall said he\u2019s felt 100% healthy since March, and even played in scrimmages with the Washington Wizard\u2019s G-League affiliate before the franchise traded him to Houston on Dec. 2 for Russell Westbrook and a lottery-protected 2023 first-round draft pick. \u201cI worked on floaters, I worked on post-ups,\u201d Wall said of his time spent rehabbing. \u201cIn all reality, people don\u2019t understand, and I can\u2019t wait to show what my bone spurs looked like and what I was playing with the last six, seven years, because it was nothing that I really could control. I couldn\u2019t plant a lot in certain ways to shoot jump shots. I couldn\u2019t even do certain moves because my leg was hurt so bad. So, now I\u2019m about to do everything on an explosive level on equal sides going left or right. That makes my game a lot better than it was before.\u201d The presence of disgruntled superstar guard James Harden could enhance things for Wall, too. Working through the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 protocols, Harden continues to participate in individual workouts at the Toyota Center until he is cleared to rejoin the team. Wall said he spoke with Harden recently, and expressed support Thursday for his projected backcourt mate, regardless of how the situation shakes out. \u201cWe have a relationship,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends before basketball. Whatever he\u2019s going through, he\u2019ll get through it and make the decision [of] what\u2019s best for him, and I think the front office will do the same thing.\u201d Harden reportedly asked the organization for a trade, but Houston hasn\u2019t shown any inclination to grant that request, and Rockets coach Stephen Silas hopes the sides can salvage the relationship. \u201cAs far as I know, he\u2019s been in the testing protocol and doing his thing,\u201d Silas said Thursday. \u201cNow he\u2019s able to do individual workouts. Today was just a little bit of a crazy day, so I haven\u2019t been able to connect with him. But I\u2019m looking forward to getting him on the court with the team, and we\u2019ll start our relationship there. But it\u2019s moving in the right direction, and it\u2019s very good.\u201d Per the NBA\u2019s protocols, Harden will reportedly need to test negative for COVID-19 for six consecutive days before he can be cleared to return to practicing with the team. Silas acknowledged that it could work out to where Harden might rejoin the Rockets as soon as Monday, provided he continues to advance through the protocols. \u201cHe\u2019s following the protocol, and when he\u2019s done with the protocol, he\u2019ll be in practice,\u201d Silas said. As for Wall, who averages 19 points and 9.2 assists per game over his career, there\u2019s no need for him to think about the pain from the past in trying to lead a new team in a new city. Wall will wear No. 1 with the Rockets. \u201cWhen I step in between those four lines and get on the basketball court, I don\u2019t think about any injury I had in the past. I think that\u2019s what makes me the type of player I am that comes back and plays with that same aggression,\u201d Wall said. \u201cYou kind of can tell if somebody\u2019s timid in the way they\u2019re playing or the way they\u2019re coming back. I just go out there with mindset [of] if I\u2019m healthy and I feel like my body\u2019s right, I\u2019m going out there to do what I do best. And I\u2019m not gonna think about it. So, I feel like the ones that do think about it, it takes a little time to get back to [themselves] or they never get back to that level they were at before.\u201d *** Michael C.

Barea on Thursday, turning loose the last piece of the franchise\u2019s 2011 championship team to give the veteran guard a chance to continue his playing career. While Barea\u2019s virtual meeting with reporters was a sometimes emotional farewell, the 36-year-old didn\u2019t rule out a return to the Mavericks based on the uncertainty of the upcoming season over COVID-19 issues. Barea said he had heard from other organizations since news of his release broke, but declined to be specific. \u201cI want to make sure everybody knows I want to play,\u201d Barea said. \u201cAnything could happen this year, with the COVID, injuries. I might be back here in Dallas playing. I\u2019ve seen it all in the NBA. I\u2019ve seen some crazy stuff.\u201d President of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said the Mavericks signed Barea knowing he probably wouldn\u2019t make the 15-man roster because they wanted to reward him for his contributions to the franchise. The 14-year veteran got $2.6 million guaranteed in the one-year deal. Nelson said the Mavericks want to bring Barea back in another capacity when his playing career is over. Barea played a crucial role in beating Miami in the 2011 NBA Finals, getting the call to start Game 4 from coach Rick Carlisle as the Mavericks went on to win three straight games for the title. \u201cHe was a huge part of that championship,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI think it was really more of an appreciation of J.J. and the amazing things he\u2019s done throughout his career is why we brought him back as the 16th player on the roster and gave him a thank you of sorts.\u201d Nelson remembered meeting Barea as a 17-year-old looking to earn a college scholarship, which the Puerto Rico native did at Northeastern before making the Dallas roster as an undrafted free agent in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough day,\u201d said Barea, who has averaged 8.9 points and 3.9 assists in 831 games. \u201cIt still hasn\u2019t hit me. It\u2019s been an amazing time here in Dallas. I wouldn\u2019t change anything. This city saw me as a kid.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Clippers are signing George to a four-year, $190 million contract. The deal will reportedly guarantee the All-Star swingman as much as $226 million over the next five seasons, his agent, Aaron Mintz, told Wojnarowski. The team officially announced the deal shortly after ESPN broke the news. \u201cThis is an important moment for our franchise and our fans, to secure a long-term commitment from one of the premier two-way players in the NBA,\u201d said Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank said in a statement released by the team. \u201cWe aspire to create a destination for players, an environment where they can succeed and enjoy their success. We\u2019re delighted by Paul\u2019s pride in representing Clippers fans, honored that he trusts the organization with this chapter of his career, and share in his relentless pursuit of championships. We admire his talent, his dedication and his unwavering allegiance to this region. We\u2019re excited for the opportunity to accomplish our mutual goals together.\u201d \u201cPaul is one of the best and most versatile players in the league, and he has been for about a decade,\u201d said Clippers coach Ty Lue. \u201cHe can play on or off the ball. He can score in a variety of different ways. And he can guard almost every position on the court. His skill and leadership will be integral to everything we do for many years to come. I\u2019m thrilled we can continue to build with PG.\u201d Last week, when the Clippers opened camp for the 2020-21 season, George made it clear to reporters he wanted to stick with the team long term. The Southern California native acknowledged a desire to retire with the franchise and echoed those sentiments after signing his lucrative extension. \u201cAs a kid growing up in Southern California, I always dreamed of playing in Los Angeles, where my friends and family could come watch me play,\u201d said George. \u201cI am so grateful to Steve Ballmer, Lawrence Frank, Coach Ty Lue, my teammates, and the entire Clippers organization for believing in me. I am proud to call this my home and look forward to doing my part in helping make the team a tremendous success \u2013 both on and off the court \u2013 in the years ahead.\u201d George\u2019s first season back home ended in disappointment, with the Clippers blowing a 3-1 lead against Denver and losing in the second round of the playoffs. He averaged 21.5 points and 5.7 rebounds during the abbreviated season. George cited inconsistency as the reason for much of what went wrong last season \u2014 lack of time together in practice, injuries and players leaving the bubble in Florida for personal reasons. \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself. I wasn\u2019t able to do the things I was good at or I was comfortable with because my shoulders weren\u2019t at peak performance,\u201d he said. George says his body feels good again and he\u2019s been putting a lot of hours in on the court. \u201cI knew last year was a rough year for me. The good thing about that is I\u2019m only 30, I still got a lot of years in the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me a big motivation going into this season. I\u2019m ready to dive right into this and give everything I have.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":439960,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-how-russell-westbrook-fits-in-with-the-wizards","date":"2020-12-10","title":"Film Study: How Russell Westbrook fits in with the Wizards","content":" Russell Westbrook is reuniting with an old coach and pairing with a star shooting guard. The trade that sent John Wall to Houston and Russell Westbrook to Washington wasn\u2019t the most intriguing deal of the offseason. Both guards are on burdensome contracts, each owed more than $130 million over the next three years. Both were at or near the nadir of their value, with Westbrook having struggled at the end of last season and Wall having not played in almost two years. But, if healthy, both players \u2013 Wall a five-time All-Star and Westbrook a former MVP \u2013 can still provide a lot of value to their new teams. And there\u2019s plenty of intrigue in regard to how they\u2019ll fit alongside their new backcourtmates. The Rockets were the much better team last season, but at this point, Westbrook\u2019s new situation in Washington seems a lot more stable. And no matter the level of discontent in Houston, the fit between Westbrook and Bradley Beal feels more natural than that of Wall and James Harden. Beal is the more malleable of the two, of course. Two Bradley Beals could play together, while two Russell Westbrooks, with both glaring strengths and glaring weaknesses, would have a more difficult time coexisting. Maximizing Westbrook means allowing him to get to the basket. He\u2019s not the best finisher at the rim \u2014 his 60.8% shooting in the restricted area ranked 68th among 102 players with at least 200 attempts last season \u2014 but he\u2019s almost the worst (high-volume) shooter from the outside. Westbrook\u2019s effective field goal percentage of 39.9% on shots from outside the paint was *the third worst mark among 190 players who took at least 200 shots from the outside last season (not including backcourt shots). * The two worst marks belonged to Jimmy Butler (34.3%) and Aaron Gordon (39.1%). The easiest way to get Westbrook to the basket is to get him out in transition. In the first six seconds of the shot clock last season, 68% of his shots came in the restricted area. In the last 18 seconds of the clock, only 38% of his shots were in the restricted area. If you want to run, it helps to have a good defense. Alas, the Wizards * ranked 29th defensively last season , and don\u2019t promise to be much better this year. * They ranked 30th until the last day of the season , when they held the shorthanded Celtics (playing without their top six guys) under a point per possession. The Wizards would be able to run more if they defended better, but they will still run. While they ranked near the bottom in each of the other \u201cfour factors\u201d on defense, they ranked fourth in opponent turnover rate last season. Combine that with a fervor for pushing after made buckets and they ranked fourth in the percentage of their possessions that were in transition (19.1%). Westbrook ranked second among individuals with 7.4 transition points per game. His transition efficiency (1.01 points per possession) was below the league average (1.11), but he gets you with volume and with the ability to change direction at full speed. Flank him with Beal (fourth with 5.9 transition points per game) and Davis Bertans (who led the league with 65 3-pointers in the first six seconds of the shot clock), and you have a potent fast break, even if the Wizards are too often taking the ball out of the basket. Getting Westbrook downhill in the half-court offense is obviously more difficult. Defenses will give him plenty of space, very willing to live with a pull-up jumper \u2026 Though he played for a team that otherwise eschewed mid-range shots, Westbrook attempted 297 of them (75% of the Rockets\u2019 total ). But the defense isn\u2019t always able to dictate where Westbrook shoots from. Though defenses had every reason to play him soft, he still averaged 15.0 points in the paint per game, becoming just the fifth different player to do so (minimum 40 games played) in the 24 years for which points in the paint have been tracked. And at 6-3, he\u2019s seven inches shorter than any of the other four (Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard). Of Westbrook\u2019s 364 buckets in the restricted area, 144 (40%) came in the last 15 seconds of the shot clock. Part of that was taking advantage of the attention paid to Harden and attacking the seams \u2026 Beal doesn\u2019t bend defenses as consistently as Harden, but he will draw extra attention and allow his teammates to eat \u2026 Westbrook was at his best when the Rockets stopped playing big men. Over 13 games from when Houston committed to small-ball (Jan. 31) to when the season was suspended, Westbrook averaged an amazing 19.2 points in the paint per game. Even if defenders are playing him soft, he can still put them on their heels and take advantage of having four shooters around him \u2026 The Wizards aren\u2019t going to play an all-6-7-and-under lineup like Houston, but they could certainly play the 6-10 Bertans, liberal launcher of long 3s, at the five. And if Thomas Bryant \u2013 41% (though on just 91 attempts) from 3-point range last season \u2013 is their starting center, he can space the floor as well. A big who can shoot can draw the opposing big out of the paint and allow a quick ball-handler to drive by \u2026  Westbrook and Beal can work in tandem. Shooters can be the best screeners, because their defenders are loath to leave them. Westbrook-Harden pick-and-rolls weren\u2019t a huge part of the Rockets\u2019 offense, but Harden did set 125 ball-screens for his backcourtmate last season, according to Second Spectrum tracking \u2026 In Washington, Beal set a lot of screens for his point guards, and he can have the same kind of gravitational pull \u2026 But Ish Smith, Isaiah Thomas and Shabazz Napier aren\u2019t nearly as explosive off the dribble as Westbrook. And a lot of those Beal picks were dummy, double-drag screens meant to set up an ensuing cross-screen or pin-down for the Wizards\u2019 star. This is one of the Wizards\u2019 favorite actions, with Beal able to sneak back door if his defender is top-locking the ensuing pick \u2026 More standard Westbrook-Beal pick-and-pop actions could present defenses with a pick-your-poison situation. Of course, the simplest way to defend guard-guard actions is to switch them, which the opponent did more than half the time when Harden set a ball screen for Westbrook. It requires good communication, but the switch flattens the action out \u2026 Because Harden is a ridiculously good isolation player, the Rockets were more efficient when defenses switched that screen than when they didn\u2019t, according to Second Spectrum. Neither Beal nor Westbrook is nearly as good playing one-on-one. While Harden has scored 1.11 points per possession on isolations over the last two seasons, Beal and Westbrook have scored 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. But the Wizards are not a heavy isolation team. In fact, there may not be an offense in the league that contrasts more with that of the Rockets. While Houston ranked 29th in ball movement (296 passes per 24 minutes of possession) and 28th in player movement (10.6 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession) last season, Washington ranked third (362) and second (11.6). The addition of Westbrook will stifle that ball movement to some degree. In Scott Brooks\u2019 last season with Westbrook in Oklahoma City (2014-15), the Thunder ranked 24th in ball movement. They ranked 29th two seasons ago. Still, his new team should allow Westbrook to operate more on the move, more off the catch, and with similar space to attack as he had in the second half of his only season in Houston. He could be the screen-setter and roll-man himself\u2026 His own relentlessness will also benefit his teammates. In each of the last four seasons, Westbrook has ranked in the top four in assists on 3-pointers, leading the league in \u201918-19, the season before he was traded to the team that shoots all the 3s. When this season tips off, you can forget the contract and the circumstances of the trade that brought him to Washington. Russell Westbrook with the ball in his hands is always a threat to attack and always worth watching. The Wizards are going to run and the Wizards are going to be fun. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The $35 million loan marks the first time a professional sports franchise has had a significant loan underwritten exclusively by Black banks. The groundbreaking transaction was facilitated with the support of the newly-formed National Black Bank Foundation, which organized a syndication team to structure the deal. Georgia-based Carver State Bank served as the syndicate\u2019s Lead Arranger. By partnering with the Black bank syndicate, the Hawks are both demonstrating that Black banks can compete with money center banks for commercial loans as well as using the Club\u2019s strong credit rating to bolster the capital cushion for Black banks so that they can better serve their traditional customer base. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement reflects our commitment to putting our values into action\u2013by choosing to work with Black banks and drawing attention to the need for Black banks to thrive as they work toward addressing the lack of access to capital in Black communities,\u201d said Tony Ressler, Principal Owner of the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cWe always strive to ask ourselves how the Hawks can best help those in the community that are already helping others, and today\u2019s announcement is another step in our commitment to use the Hawks as a positive agent of change. This is both good for the community and good business to empower new and existing Black businesses.\u201d \u201cThe Atlanta Hawks are putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to being an ally of Black businesses, and Carver State Bank is proud to be the lead institution on this historic transaction. By selecting an all-Black bank syndicate to provide this financing, the Hawks are strengthening all of our banks,\u201d said Robert E. James, II, President, Carver Development & Chairman-Elect, National Bankers Association. \u201cWhat we earn from this loan strengthens our collective ability to provide even more loans and financial services to Black small businesses and consumers, and we are able to show our ability to pull off a large, sophisticated loan transaction. Tony and his team are real allies in the movement for racial equity.\u201d \u201cBecause Black-owned banks are so starved for capital, they\u2019ve previously not been able to compete with major commercial banks or scale to meet the unique needs of borrowers of color, who are rejected for credit at twice the national rate,\u201d Ashley Bell, NBBF general counsel, said. \u201cBecause of the Hawks\u2019 leadership and commitment to financial inclusion, Black banks are finally playing in the major league.\u201d Located in Brookhaven, the 90,000-square-foot Emory Sports Medicine Complex contains the official training and practice facility of the Hawks, the hub of Emory Healthcare\u2019s Sports Medicine program and Sports Science and Research division and the Peak Performance Project (P3). The complex was completed in the Fall 2017. \u201cThe Hawks are not only the first-in-league with this deal, but are the first in all major league sports,\u201d said Ryan Clark, NBBF board member, ESPN commentator and NFL alumni. \u201cBanking black is a simple but incredibly powerful demonstration of professional sports franchise\u2019s commitment to their players and their fans. Now we need other teams to follow the Hawks\u2019 lead.\u201d Carver State Bank led the syndicate of Black banks, which also included Carver Federal Savings Bank, Citizens Savings Bank, Citizens Trust Bank, Commonwealth National Bank, Industrial Bank, Liberty Bank & Trust, M&F Bank, and Optus Bank. Under federal regulation, banks can only create credit roughly equivalent to 10 times their Tier 1 capital, which is generated from interest on deposits, banking fees, and the sale of stock. With the support of the NBBF, Black-owned banks are now better able to come together in order to become competitive with major banks, significantly increase the amount of money they can lend, and thereby increase the services they can provide to the communities they serve. \u201cThis partnership reflects the idea of the \u201cgenius of \u201cAND\u201d because it makes great financial sense AND has the ability to meaningfully change a community\u2019s landscape. It was truly rewarding to work with NBBF and our syndicate banks to develop the structure and create the relationships that has already made the transaction a success,\u201d said Hawks & State Farm Arena Chief Operating Officer Thad Sheely. In minority-majority zip codes, Black banks are often the primary source for fair, non-predatory lending. But since 2001, their numbers have fallen by more than 50 percent. Today, there are just 18 Black-owned banks left, according to the FDIC. The retrenchment of Black banks has created bank branch deserts that have led to historic disparities between America\u2019s banked and unbanked populations. According to the Federal Reserve, 49 percent of Black households were unbanked or underbanked in 2019, compared to just 15 percent of white families. Earlier this fall, the Ressler Gertz Family Foundation and Hawks announced investments totaling $40 million to bolster economic empowerment in Black communities in Atlanta and expanded their community and diversity & inclusion commitment. Comer Capital Group and Dentons acted as financial advisor and counsel, respectively, to the syndicate led by Carver State Bank and they assisted the National Black Bank Foundation."},{"id":439133,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/like-teams-nba-refs-have-new-health-safety-protocols","date":"2020-12-10","title":"Like teams, NBA refs have new health, safety protocols","content":"NBA referees will have to adhere to many of the same new health and safety protocols as coaches and players are this season, all part of the league\u2019s plan to try to keep everyone safe during the coronavirus pandemic. Referees will be tested daily, just like players and coaches, and will have to comply with new league rules about avoiding bars, lounges, clubs, public gyms and many other indoor gathering spots. The league is also coming up with methods designed to reduce referee travel, some of which is still evolving. \u201cObviously, we won\u2019t be able to eliminate all travel,\u201d said Monty McCutchen, an NBA vice president who oversees referee development and training. \u201cAs much as we would like to, that won\u2019t be possible. But just like the league took into consideration many scheduling issues for the teams to significantly reduce travel, we\u2019re going to look at as many possibilities on a one-year basis to reduce travel so we can effectively serve the game while still living in this pandemic.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon for NBA referees to work two or three games in a week, but teams rarely see the same referee more than once every few weeks. That may change this season, though the specifics on how remain unclear. \u201cWe want to be good stewards to both the game and those that serve the game,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the balance we\u2019re trying to find.\u201d Referee hotels will be limited this season to ones that the NBA deems compliant with its protocols, and there are policies in place for how to react if a referee becomes ill or tests positive while on the road. Even the way referees get from hotels to arenas is changing: instead of all traveling together in a van, referees will now have individual car service \u2014 a decision made with social distancing and preventing potential exposure in mind. And the mileage maximum that referees can drive if they choose to go that route from one city to the next has been raised as well. The on-court way referees go about their business is not expected to change much. Referees added a protective cloth bag over their whistles \u2014 a move made to limit how much spittle could get strewn about \u2014 when last season resumed in the bubble at Walt Disney World; the baggie is being replaced now by more of a hard plastic shell that has shown to be more effective. Points of emphasis from last season such as traveling, regulating illegal contact initiated by offensive players both on- and off-the-ball, freedom of movement on the offensive end and respect for the game will remain top priorities for referees this year. There are no substantial rule changes. \u201cThe game is in a really good place right now, and since it is a good place and with short cycle between last season and this season we thought it best to reinforce and continue on with last season\u2019s points of emphasis,\u201d said McCutchen, who led a four-day slate of virtual preseason meetings with all NBA referees that ended earlier this week. \u201cAnd those will continue for this year.\u201d"},{"id":438851,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kareem-abdul-jabbar-reveals-past-prostate-cancer-diagnosis-in-essay","date":"2020-12-10","title":"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reveals past prostate cancer diagnosis in essay","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar revealed he had prostate cancer in a magazine article he wrote about health risks faced by Blacks.

The reigning back-to-back Kia NBA Most Valuable Player has through Dec. 21 to agree to a five-year, \u201csupermax\u201d extension (worth an estimated $228 million) that would begin after this 2020-21 season. If he does, the Bucks project to be title contenders for the duration of the deal. If he declines, Antetokounmpo will become an unrestricted free agent next summer. He still could re-sign with the Bucks at that point, but passing on the extension would throw this season into tumult and signal to the fans, the city, the franchise and the league that the versatile 6-foot-11 wing might head elsewhere to seek the championship ring he craves. \u201cRight now I\u2019m not focusing on that,\u201d Antetokounmpo said in a Zoom media session after the Bucks\u2019 midday camp workout. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to focus on myself, how I can get better, how I can help my teammates get better, how can we be ready Saturday for our first preseason game [vs. Dallas].\u201d And that\u2019s how it went for about 15 minutes, with Antetokounmpo being asked about his plans in a variety of ways and, each time, the double-MVP offering no insight in return. Let\u2019s just say if former Slam Dunk champ Nate Robinson was as good at bobbing and weaving as the Greek Freak proved Wednesday, he wouldn\u2019t have face-planted in his viral boxing debut. Repeatedly, Antetokounmpo deferred to his agent Alex Saratsis, who has been in discussions with Bucks ownership and general manager Jon Horst over \u201clunch, dinner, brunch.\u201d \u201cI do what I love,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWhat I love is playing basketball, what I love is improving, what I love is helping my teammates improve. What I love is winning games. \u201cOff the court about agents and contracts, I\u2019m not focusing on that. Not that I don\u2019t care about it \u2014 it\u2019s a very big decision, probably the biggest decision I\u2019ll ever make.\u201d It\u2019s a big deal literally and figuratively, because Antetokounmpo is one of a handful of NBA stars whose presence can convey contender status on a team, and whose change of address could shift the league\u2019s balance of power for years to come. He is, after all, just 26 years old, celebrating that birthday on the first day of camp Sunday as teammates let him know \u2014 not at all subtly \u2014 where they stand on his contract decision. As gifts, they gave him pens. One after another after another. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cKhris [Middleton] came in and gave me a present. I was like, \u2018Whoa, what is this?\u2019 Then I was thinking about and I realized he was wanting me to sign the contract. \u201cI laughed the first time. I laughed the second time. The third time \u2026 and then I got like 20 pens. It got a little bit old. I\u2019ve got 20 pens here in my locker.\u201d Antetokounmpo had a historic statistical season in 2019-20. He averaged 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists, and in addition to his second MVP, earned Defensive Player of the Year recognition. He has led Milwaukee to a combined 116-39 record over the past two regular seasons, tops in the NBA, while elevating the Bucks to first in defensive rankings, too. But abrupt exits from the playoffs both years \u2014 against Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals in 2019, then in the conference semis vs. Miami in the Orlando bubble \u2014 have fueled speculation that Antetokounmpo might want more help to win than Milwaukee can provide. His game has flaws, too, which some see as a sign that he needs a fellow MVP-type of sidekick, like LeBron James and Anthony Davis with the Lakers. Antetokounmpo never has hinted at that; he never has expressed anything but appreciation for his teammates, the organization and the market. But his decision in the next 12 days might speak loudly as far as how he feels about Middleton, Brook Lopez, newly acquired guard Jrue Holiday and an overhauled bench as cohorts in search of The Finals. Though he didn\u2019t accept a championship-or-bust view on this Bucks season, Antetokounmpo made it clear the loss to the Heat in five games was unacceptable. \u201cWhat we showed in the bubble wasn\u2019t ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even close to what we can do. Going into the season, our focus is we\u2019ve got to get better. We\u2019ve got to be the toughest, the nastiest. The team that plays together. But we have to take it step-by-step. Nobody wants to win a championship more than me, I can guarantee you that. But there are steps to take. \u201cI\u2019m not playing not to win the championship,\u201d Antetokounmpo added. \u201cI\u2019m not playing to be second or third or fifth. I\u2019m playing to be the best.\u201d Teammates, coaches and staff aren\u2019t disinterested spectators. Middleton and Lopez, for instance, signed lucrative contracts last year that will keep them in Milwaukee\u2019s control at least through 2023. \u201cHe knows that I deeply want him to return and sign this extension,\u201d said Middleton, a two-time All-Star, last week. \u201cBut at the same time, I know he\u2019s got a big decision that he\u2019s got to work through himself and with his family at home, because those are the most important people. Whatever he does, he knows that I\u2019ll support him to the fullest.\u201d Said coach Mike Budenholzer: \u201cWhile I completely respect and understand the questions, completely respect and understand how the world may view this, when you\u2019re in a training camp, when you\u2019re in a practice, you\u2019re trying to figure out what pick-and-roll defense we\u2019re running. What offense we\u2019re running. \u201cYou just get lost in the process. You get lost in what you\u2019re doing. You get lost in trying to figure out how to win.\u201d With Giannis, of course, being the better option than without Giannis. Because the length and value of the Bucks\u2019 offer is maxed out, Antetokounmpo was asked more than once why he wouldn\u2019t sign the extension now, if he\u2019s planning to do so by the Dec. 21 deadline. He evaded that tactic too. (Technically, per ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks , Antetokounmpo could sign a non-supermax contract for fewer years and less money after Dec. 21. But there would be no advantage to that, other than perhaps dialing up pressure on the Bucks front office to keep the team highly competitive.) \u201cIt\u2019s not on my mind,\u201d said the No. 15 draft pick in 2013, a skinny 18-year-old then, far more developed and savvy today. \u201cWhat\u2019s on my mind is playing basketball and improving every day. That\u2019s where it\u2019s been since Day 1 and it\u2019s never going to change. Year 8 or Year 25, not gonna change. \u201cI trust my agent, I trust Jon Horst and the ownership. I know this is really, really big in the city of Milwaukee and the NBA world and the media world and all that. But I\u2019ve been a private person. Whenever I decide something or I sign a contract, you guys are probably going to know before I know. \u201cSo I would appreciate, from now on, that we try not to talk as much about that and just focus on basketball. Because the answer is still going to be the same.\u201d Like it or not, so will the questions, and they\u2019ll keep coming. Until Antetokounmpo signs his next deal, either this month or next summer. * * *"},{"id":437249,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-coaches-attire-masks-are-in-jackets-are-optional","date":"2020-12-09","title":"NBA coaches attire: Masks are in, jackets are optional","content":"MIAMI (AP) \u2014 For NBA coaches, masks are required this season. Jackets are not. Rules for coaching attire will be relaxed by the league this year, though not as much as was the case during play at the bubble at Walt Disney World this past summer. Suit jackets or sport coats will not be required \u2014 as was the case in the bubble, when most coaches wore polo shirts and many said they preferred that option. The new league mandate, as detailed in a memo sent to coaches Sunday and obtained by The Associated Press , requires \u201cbusiness attire \u2026 dress shirts, pants, socks, and shoes.\u201d There\u2019s no mention of ties, which some coaches have often gone without in recent years, but an exception is made for polo shirts as long as they are NBA-licensed and the head coach and all assistant coaches are wearing the same shirt. The biggest change, though, is the masks, a decision made with safety in mind as the coronavirus pandemic rages on and NBA teams prepare to play in arenas again for the first time since last season was suspended on March 11 when Utah center Rudy Gobert tested positive. \u201cThe NBA has always been a dynamic business and the challenges we face in society right now with COVID, it only amplifies the dynamic nature of our business,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle, the president of the National Basketball Coaches Association, told AP on Tuesday night. \u201cYou have to be able to adapt, you have to be looking for solutions \u2026 and we\u2019re going to make it work.\u201d The NBA preseason begins Friday and the regular season starts Dec. 22. The NBCA discussed the changes in a call with the league Tuesday night, and some teams will begin traveling for preseason games Thursday. \u201cWear a mask at all times,\u201d Carlisle said when asked how he\u2019s preparing for the challenges that will come with traveling again for games. \u201cThat\u2019s your No. 1 shield. And No. 2, be alert and follow the protocols. It\u2019s an incredible amount of work to not get COVID. You\u2019ve got to work extremely hard to try to stay out of harm\u2019s way and there are never any guarantees. But if you work at it you have a chance.\u201d San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich wore masks for games in the bubble this past summer, as did former Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni and former New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry. They are all 65 or older, and at more risk of contracting the virus based on guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, masks are a mandate for all coaches, regardless of age. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said he hopes the move by coaches will further normalize mask-wearing among the public; the Heat were part of a campaign across Florida last summer, as virus numbers were soaring, to get people to wear masks. \u201cThat\u2019s why I continued to wear masks during the playoffs, during the finals, even when we were not required to wear them during our media sessions,\u201d Spoelstra told The Associated Press . \u201cOne, it became a habit. And then two, we want to continue to use our platform to make people aware that masks can and do make a difference. And if they see us wearing them all the time and not having a problem with it and understanding the importance of it, hopefully that can normalize it everywhere else.\u201d It\u2019s not just a game-night rule. The league, with limited exceptions, also will require coaches to wear masks \u201cat all times\u201d inside their team facility, while traveling and during practices. \u201cAlthough I look very good in a suit and tie, I will admit, I\u2019m also very, very comfortable wearing a Nuggets polo and a pair of TravisMathew athletic leisure wear pants,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said last season during play in the bubble. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done a very good job with the look.\u201d Alas, the athletic pants \u2014 \u201cathleisure\u201d is the term the NBA uses \u2014 must be shelved for game nights this season. The decision on coaches wearing masks comes not long after the league and the National Basketball Players Association decided on health and safety protocols for the coming season, including how teams that do not comply with league rules designed to minimize the spread of the coronavirus could face major penalties such as forfeiting games or draft picks."},{"id":436962,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2020-21-nba-fantasy-preseason-rankings","date":"2020-12-08","title":"2020-21 NBA Fantasy Draft Rankings","content":"See below for player rankings from FantasyPros.

Silas said on Monday that \u201cthere is no timetable\u201d for Harden\u2019s return, calling his absence \u201ca setback.\u201d After Harden\u2019s arrival on Tuesday, Silas expressed optimism about building a relationship with the disgruntled former MVP. Harden is expected to join the team for training camp once he\u2019s cleared to return, and Silas indicated that he still hasn\u2019t spoken with him. It\u2019s unclear whether Harden will join the rest of the team on the road for the Rockets\u2019 preseason opener on Friday at Chicago. \u201cTrust is built day to day, and once the relationship begins, we\u2019ll begin that process of trust,\u201d Silas said. \u201cObviously, there wasn\u2019t a great start to it, but that\u2019s the NBA. The NBA is not going to be roses every day.\u201d In Houston, the Rockets are in the midst of sweeping change with new coach Silas looking to implement his philosophies on a roster maintained by a new general manager in Rafael Stone. This offseason, the Rockets lost nine players, including 2017 MVP Russell Westbrook, who was traded last week to the Washington Wizards to bring aboard new point guard John Wall. The club also signed DeMarcus Cousins and Christian Wood in free agency. Silas believes Harden should be able to quickly absorb what the staff has implemented over the first three days of training camp. \u201cElite players have a way of learning fast, fitting in and making everyone better,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThere will be some sort of learning curve.\u201d Under contract for at least the next two seasons with a player option for 2022, Harden reportedly requested a trade earlier this offseason, but he hasn\u2019t addressed the media since September, after Houston\u2019s conference semifinals series loss to the Lakers. Silas said last week that he hadn\u2019t spoken to Harden since the team traded Westbrook for Wall. Silas maintained that he wanted to give Harden \u201csome space.\u201d *** Michael C.

They are the players who didn\u2019t suit up in Orlando last summer for the season restart or are coming off long layoffs due to injury. For many of these players, it\u2019s the longest stretch they\u2019ve gone without basketball since they first picked one up. Their comebacks will be anticipated and examined, if only because curiosity will greet them from the opening tip. Can they be the player they were before the layoff? Can they be better? How do they fit in a team environment and dynamic that changed in their absence? Those are all reasonable questions and concerns in most cases. Here are the 10 players whose reappearance on the court will generate buzz, in no specific order: * * * Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets: It was just 18 months ago when the former Kia MVP and regular All-NBA star was generally considered the best player in the sport. And now, after Achilles surgery and an extended recovery period and watching Giannis Antetokounmpo win two MVPs and LeBron James claim another championship, Durant can finally re-enter that conversation. The Nets are his team, and New York can be his city, and it\u2019s really about his ability to elevate Brooklyn into the championship mix. Because he\u2019s such a great shooter and doesn\u2019t totally rely on speed and quickness, his injury history shouldn\u2019t be a major obstacle in his comeback. John Wall, Houston Rockets: Once a fixture among the finest point guards, the five-time All-Star hasn\u2019t played since the winter of 2018 because of leg injuries. Suddenly, he became \u201ca contract,\u201d meaning, someone whose enormous salary (four years, $170 million) overwhelmed his basketball worth. After the Wizards lost patience and went with a more sure-thing with Russell Westbrook in a trade with Houston , Wall is now the Rockets\u2019 problem or solution, depending on how he returns from those injuries and meshes with James Harden, who\u2019ll dominate the ball. DeMarcus Cousins, Houston Rockets: Does anyone know if Cousins is getting a championship ring from the Lakers? That\u2019s the second-biggest question facing the big man. The more important one: Can Cousins still perform? He essentially hasn\u2019t performed in about three seasons, after major injuries wrecked his plans in New Orleans, Golden State and last season with the Lakers. After missing out on generous free agent paydays along the way, he\u2019s at a crossroads in Houston, where he\u2019ll at least share a comeback story with Wall, his old college teammate . It would be shameful if his best NBA life was wasted in Sacramento, but that appears to be the case. Blake Griffin, Detroit Pistons: Two of his last three seasons were cut short because of knee issues and Griffin saw just 18 games in 2019-20, when he had surgery twice on his left knee. He\u2019s 31 and still on a max contract, not a great combination when you also consider his string of injuries. The last time he was reasonably healthy, in 2018-19, Griffin averaged 24.5 points and improved his range and became third team All-NBA, so the talent remains, but what about his body? If he can stay on the floor long enough and play well enough, the rebuilding Pistons will certainly showcase him before the trade deadline, if anyone is tempted. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves: Nobody had a tougher summer than the former No. 1 overall pick, who said he lost seven family members \u2014 including his mother \u2014 to coronavirus. You simply can\u2019t recover from that. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Towns copes with that tragedy when basketball arrives to provide a temporary and welcome distraction. He\u2019ll join the Wolves\u2019 newest No. 1 overall pick, Anthony Edwards, and seek to bring the Wolves closer to uncharted territory \u2014 the playoffs \u2014 by at least qualifying for the play-in tournament. Having his friend D\u2019Angelo Russell around for a full season will help Towns on and off the court. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors: There\u2019s undoubtedly plenty of anxiousness within the former two-time MVP and three-time champion, held to just five games last season because of a broken left hand. That, and the absence of Klay Thompson this season will give Curry all the motivation he needs. The game\u2019s premier shooter will have his hands full trying to lead a team in transition and also putting Golden State back among the top tier of teams in the NBA, or at least the Western Conference. It\u2019s the type of challenge Curry has embraced throughout his basketball career, back when he was forced to attend Davidson because few of the big schools wanted him. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets: Aside from his personality quirks and questionable leadership ability, the fact remains Irving is an elite playmaker who can change any game with his scoring and court sense. A bum shoulder limited him to 20 games last season, his first with the Nets, but his injury recovery has coincided with Kevin Durant\u2019s and now Brooklyn is ready to launch a journey that can take the Nets deep into the post-season. In that sense, it doesn\u2019t matter how Irving relates to the media after he recently declared he\u2019ll only speak through prepared statements; rather, it\u2019s how he relates to Durant. And all signs are positive so far. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks: He had a massive 2019-20 season, ranking among the leaders in scoring and assists , and hardly anyone noticed because the Hawks didn\u2019t make the playoffs or participate in the restart. And, besides, some people still haven\u2019t gotten over Luka Doncic being traded for Young. Fine. But he returns with a far better cast, one that should put the Hawks in the playoff discussion. He\u2019ll get to sit at the knee of Rajon Rondo, who knows a thing or three about running a team. Given those goodies, there\u2019s no reason why Young shouldn\u2019t be an All-Star again, even if if his defense doesn\u2019t improve drastically. Zach LaVine, Chicago Bulls: There are some in the basketball world whose eyes will always tell them to question players who post good numbers on losing teams. LaVine seems to be one of those players, fair or not. Last season he averaged 25.5 points on 45% shooting and 38% on 3-pointers to make himself a certified offensive weapon. And yet, his name was tossed about in trade rumors. The Bulls are under new management, which heightens those rumors, yet they have resisted any urge to deal LaVine (who is arguably their best player). LaVine is only 25 and plays an exciting game \u2014 a better defensive effort and more wins this season will change plenty of opinions. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs: He\u2019s still a fairly efficient mid-range specialist who can play both power positions, but Aldridge will turn 36 this season and The Other Side Of The Hill is beckoning. Do the Spurs, who rarely make trades, seek to re-route him before the deadline to a contender in exchange for youth and\/or Draft picks? Given that San Antonio is coming off its first non-playoff appearance in more than two decades, and isn\u2019t exactly bringing a loaded roster or a true star to 2020-21, this is a topic it may explore. Aldridge was held to 53 games after shoulder surgery last season and sat out the restart . * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

And he wants it to be with the Golden State Warriors the entire way. Curry said discussions have begun with the team about a contract extension and he is \u201cfully committed.\u201d The two-time NBA MVP signed a $201 million, five-year contract in July 2017 that initially was the richest ever, until James Harden topped it with a $228 million extension from the Rockets. \u201cEverything\u2019s on the table right now,\u201d Curry said. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a matter of just letting things kind of play out the way that they should. That\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d The 32-year-old Curry is entering his 12th NBA season \u2014 and he always aimed to play 16 years in the league, just like father Dell did. \u201cThat was always the goal,\u201d Curry said Monday on a Zoom call with reporters following the first day of training camp. \u201cNow it\u2019s just more so listen to your body. Who knows. You can\u2019t predict the future. I\u2019ve always said I want to play as long as I can play at the level I want to be at and hopefully you can be in that position where you end it on your own terms. Whatever that means, hopefully that is closer to 40.\u201d Curry likes what the Warriors did this offseason to build another title contender after an NBA-worst 15-50 showing during the shortened 2019-20 season, when he was limited to five games because of a broken left hand. That was tough to see after five straight trips to the NBA Finals, so a commitment to winning every season is a must \u2014 and \u201cI want to be a part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWearing the same jersey for as long as I can, that\u2019s a huge goal, for sure. It\u2019s an elite club of guys that you look at that have played with the same organization and been successful and achieved greatness in that respect,\u201d said Curry, who turns 33 in March. \u201cThat would be an awesome accomplishment, something I\u2019ve obviously spoken publicly about and very committed to. But that also goes with there\u2019s a lot more to be accomplished on the court and again I can\u2019t fast forward to what the end is going to be. Enjoy the moment, enjoy the challenges that we have in front of us and what I have left to accomplish as a player.\u201d And when he tells wife Ayesha he wants to play until he\u2019s 40? \u201cI have a floating target on that, for sure. Any time I say I want to play up to 40 she\u2019ll definitely give me a little look,\u201d Curry said. Curry was due to make $43 million this season \u2014 his salary is expected to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 and nearly $45.8 million in 2021-22. \u201cI\u2019m blessed to be in this position and hopefully the conversation every year as I do get into that age you see other guys in the league that are always in that conversation of competing for championships,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to hold onto for as long as you can.\u201d Golden State went through its first training camp workout missing No. 2 overall draft pick James Wiseman and All-Star Draymond Green. While coach Steve Kerr didn\u2019t confirm their positive test results, he made it clear they were the only two to miss practice. General manager Bob Myers acknowledged last week two players had tested positive for COVID-19 without providing names and they would be out at least 10 days before testing again, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is unexpected with all the guys coming back in. Kind of proves the protocols and testing are working.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to comment. You can make your own deductions. I know it\u2019s really tricky,\u201d Kerr said. \u201d\u2026 I\u2019m just trying to figure out which one of you has put all of the pieces together and figured out what\u2019s happening here and if there\u2019s anybody on the screen who hasn\u2019t figured it out yet.

That\u2019s when James learned that his 17th NBA offseason would be unprecedentedly short. When James was told the NBA intended to resume games on Dec. 22, just 72 days after the Lakers beat Miami to win the title, the superstar admits he reacted with a mild expletive. \u201cJust being completely honest, I wasn\u2019t expecting that,\u201d James said Monday in his first public comments since the NBA champions opened training camp. \u201cEarly conversations were going on, and I was hearing there would be kind of a mid-January start,\u201d James said. \u201cTraining camp would start after Christmas, and we would have the opportunity to spend Christmas with our families. \u2026 I had to switch up a lot of things. I just started preparing my mind and preparing my body.\u201d James still reported to camp ready last week for his 18th NBA season and the pursuit of yet another banner with the Lakers, who added an impressive amount of veteran talent in the abbreviated offseason for their repeat quest. James also showed up with a new two-year, $85 million contract extension through the 2022-23 season, setting his future in Los Angeles through his 20th NBA campaign. James chose that year deliberately: His oldest son, LeBron James Jr., will graduate from high school in 2023. Bronny is a sophomore at private Sierra Canyon School, where he played a reserve role on the basketball team last season, and LeBron has previously spoken of his fond dream to play in the NBA with \u2014 or against \u2014 his son. \u201cThe best thing about it is the year I\u2019ll be a free agent will be the same year my oldest son graduates high school,\u201d James said of his new deal. \u201cI\u2019ll have some options to see, for me personally, what I want to do (going) forward \u2014 being around my family, being around my son more, or continue to play this game I love with great health and great spirits. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Whether that happens, and whether it will be in Los Angeles, won\u2019t be certain for three long years. James intends to make the most of the meantime. James will shoulder the physical challenges of this difficult year, but it isn\u2019t easy: He said he was \u201csore as hell\u201d Monday, although that\u2019s normal every year after the first two preseason practices. The uniqueness of 2020 has forced James and the Lakers to consider whether they should practice load management this season. LeBron has largely declined to follow other stars\u2019 strategy of strategic absences from games in recent years: He played in all 82 games for Cleveland in 2017-18, and after an injury-plagued 2018-19 in LA, he only missed four games last season. Still, James has played 1,265 career regular-season games \u2014 already the 33rd-most in league history \u2014 and an NBA-record 260 playoff contests as he heads toward his 36th birthday later this month.  James and the Lakers haven\u2019t decided on their plans for the regular season, with James saying there\u2019s \u201ca fine line\u201d between strategic rest and unnecessary inactivity. He does sound amenable to limited action in the preseason, which begins Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be as smart as I can be in making sure that my body and making sure that I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d James said. \u201cEvery game matters, but we\u2019re competing for something that\u2019s high. I understand that with the shortened (training camp) and the offseason is going to be the shortest in any professional sports ever, we\u2019re going to be very conscious about what we do going forward and with me personally.\u201d Coach Frank Vogel says it\u2019s too early to make a decision about how much James will play in the preseason or in the regular season. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to underdo it and then he\u2019s not ready to play in real games, but we obviously don\u2019t want to overdo it,\u201d Vogel said of the preseason. \u201cSo really don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to land. I expect we\u2019ll probably see him some, but not a ton.\u201d No matter what James decides to do this season and into the future, the Lakers clearly have no worries about his long-term viability as a difference-making star. General manager Rob Pelinka signed James last week to a maximum contract extension that will keep him together with Anthony Davis for at least the next three seasons \u2014 an enviable situation for any team. Pelinka says James\u2019 success is rooted in the versatility of his game, along with his intellectual ability to excel with more than pure athleticism. \u201cBecause of those gifts, he\u2019s going to continue to be a dominant player well beyond what the regular, ordinary NBA player would be able to do,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a debate for us. We think he\u2019s going to be very effective and provide extraordinary value for every year he decides to play as a Laker. \u201cWhat was especially satisfying and exciting about (the latest championship) is that now you can see, with the legacy he\u2019s establishing as a Laker, that his greatness will be defined here. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll hang many jerseys someday, but we hope one of those will be a Lakers jersey.\u201d"},{"id":426123,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spotlighting-the-8-true-contenders-for-2020-21-season","date":"2020-12-07","title":"Spotlighting the 8 true contenders for 2020-21 season","content":"The chase for the top four spots in the Eastern and Western Conference standings tipped off well in advance of the Dec. 22 start of the 2020-21 NBA season. You can go back as far as the start of trade season to see who was serious about contending. Draft night and then free agency were the next steps. And with the start of training camps around the league just days away, the picture is coming into better focus with each transaction. There are tiers in this game, teams that separate themselves from the pack based on the work they do in the offseason \u2014 even an abbreviated and compressed one like we\u2019re living through right now. So in advance of the Dec. 1 open of training camps, here\u2019s a list of the true contenders (four from the Eastern Conference teams and four more from the Western Conference): 2019-20 finish: 56-17, 1st Eastern Conference, lost to Miami in conference semifinals Key offseason acquisitions: Jrue Holiday, Bobby Portis, D.J. Augustin 2020-21 outlook: The Bucks hope an upgrade at point guard (Holiday and Augustin in place of Eric Bledsoe and George Hill) is the key to getting past their issues in the playoffs. Portis adds an element of toughness and paint scoring that could also prove beneficial for the second unit. The signature of Giannis Antetokounmpo on that five-year extension any time in the next month is the tonic the organization needs to ease any fears going into this season. That said, the postseason is where all of the moves (including increased flexibility from coach Mike Budenholzer) will ultimately be judged. Being the best regular season team in the league for a third straight season won\u2019t move the needle much in Milwaukee as the bitter taste of coming up short in each of the past two postseasons. The power of Giannis alone is cause for optimism. The reigning, back-to-back Kia MVP has earned the right to inspire that sort of confidence. A quasi-Big 3 of Giannis, Khris Middleton and Holiday is enough to keep the Bucks in the contender mix for the foreseeable future. 2019-20 Finish: 44-29, 5th Eastern Conference, lost to Los Angeles Lakers in The Finals Key offseason acquisitions: Avery Bradley, Moe Harkless, Precious Achiuwa (rookie) 2020-21 outlook: The quality of Miami\u2019s free-agent additions speak to the culture of an organization that attracts veteran role players. Both Bradley and Harkless, excellent defenders and somewhat underrated offensive performers, are perfect fits targeted by Pat Riley and Andy Elisburg. Achiuwa will add depth to an already deep roster that came into its own in the Orlando bubble. With Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo (fresh off of agreeing to a five-year extension ), Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Andre Iguodala, Kendrick Nunn and re-signed veteran point Goran Dragic leading the way, the Heat are poised to leapfrog a few teams in the standings. The temptation to move the Heat ahead of the Bucks in the pecking order is strong heading into training camp. The continuity and confidence built in the past year should give coach Erik Spoelstra much more comfortability with his group than he had going into his first training camp with Butler and the youngsters that played their way to the final game of the season. 2019-20 finish: 35-37, 7th Eastern Conference, lost to Toronto in the first round Key offseason acquisitions: Landry Shamet, Jeff Green 2020-21 outlook: It\u2019s not the influx of talent that fuels the belief in the Nets, it\u2019s the return of superstars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving coupled with the addition of Steve Nash and his coaching staff (which includes Mike D\u2019Antoni and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire) that has the Nets believing they are in instant contender mode. Nash\u2019s embrace of these supersized expectations is refreshing. The hardest part, however, remains. He\u2019ll have to cultivate the chemistry of this group in short order to put them on a trajectory that matches the optimism. We still don\u2019t know if Durant will be all the way back to his normal self after his Achilles injury. And there will be some uncertainty for guys like Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie as long as the trade rumors continue to swirl. But from a talent standpoint, the Nets have assembled a group that holds up against anyone else in the Eastern Conference and actually boasts the best 1-2 punch in Durant and Kyrie Irving. This isn\u2019t the exact same projection the LA Clippers had in training camp last season, but it\u2019s close. 2019-20 finish: 48-24, 3rd Eastern Conference, lost to Miami in conference finals Key offseason acquisitions: Tristan Thompson, Jeff Teague, Aaron Nesmith (rookie) 2020-21 outlook: Danny Ainge\u2019s restraint this offseason is as impressive as it is surprising, given his usual preference for tinkering with the roster. But the Celtics stumbled onto something in the bubble playing off the strengths of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart and Daniel Theis. A physical force like Thompson adds an element of defensive toughness and rebounding that Enes Kanter simply did not. Teague is subtle improvement as a backup. And don\u2019t sleep on Grant Williams, who acquitted himself quite well in the bubble. The continued development of Carson Edwards, Robert Williams and Romeo Langford is critical for depth purposes. Adding a shooter with the size and versatility of Nesmith adds even more depth. The Celtics will still have some size and depth concerns to address, but there\u2019s no denying the potency of their core group and what they\u2019ve already accomplished as Tatum and Brown enter the primes of their careers. Three more to keep an eye on:  Toronto, Philadelphia, Atlanta 2019-20 finish: 52-19, 1st Western Conference, defeated Miami in The Finals Key offseason acquisitions: Dennis Schroder, Montrezl Harrell, Marc Gasol, Wesley Matthews 2020-21 outlook: Rob Pelinka\u2019s quest for the respect LeBron James talked about the night the Lakers clinched championship No. 17 in the Orlando bubble continued into the offseason. Pelinka didn\u2019t rest on what was accomplished. He added key pieces in Schroder, Harrell, Gasol and Matthews. He knows LeBron will figure out a way to integrate each of those veterans into the mix that flows through he and Anthony Davis (whose contract situation is nothing to worry about). Running it back with Markieff Morris and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who were both superb in their roles in the Lakers\u2019 bubble title run, makes plenty of sense. The kicker will be figuring out exactly what works with so many different rotation options. With no Rajon Rondo around to aid that cause, this is what will occupy the majority of coach Frank Vogel and his staff\u2019s time in the first weeks of this truncated regular season. Beyond that, the Lakers enter this season head and shoulders above the competition. 2019-20 finish: 46-27, 3rd Western Conference, lost to the Lakers in conference finals Key offseason acquisitions: JaMychal Green, Facundo Campazzo, R.J. Hampton (rookie) 2020-21 outlook: The Nuggets\u2019 deft touch in the Draft allowed them to move on from the Jerami Grant free-agent sweepstakes in favor of leaning into the Michael Porter Jr.\/Bol Bol experiment. Re-signing Paul Millsap on a reported one-year deal also provides some insurance for a team that needs to sort out its minutes priorities after a surprising run to the conference finals in the Orlando bubble. Coach Mike Malone has his dynamic duo in All-NBA big man Nikola Jokic and rising star Jamal Murray. Filling in the blanks properly around those two is where the real work kicks in during training camp. The competition for minutes at every other position should be fierce, which is exactly the way Nuggets\u2019 brass should want it, if the Nuggets are all in on what they started in Orlando. Porter Jr. and Bol are undeniably next-level talents. Whether they are truly ready for the prime time grind of a full season remains to be seen (the bubbles was a useful but limited sample). 2019-20 finish: 49-23, 2nd Western Conference, lost to Denver in conference semifinals Key offseason acquisitions: Serge Ibaka, Luke Kennard 2020-21 outlook: Ibaka is a great get and fit for a Clippers team clearly looking shake things up (fitting Ibaka for the role Kia Sixth Man Award winner Harrell played for them last season). Re-signing Marcus Morris to a four-year, $64 million deal speaks to the Clippers belief that his quality work in the bubble (on both ends of the floor) translates long-term. Trading for Luke Kennard and sliding him into the role Landry Shamet played last season makes sense, especially if the knee issues that limited Kennard to just 28 games last season are a thing of the past. But barring a trade that dramatically shakes things up, these Clippers under new coach Tyronn Lue will resemble the same team Doc Rivers couldn\u2019t get past the Nuggets in the bubble. The Clippers are betting on the fresh perspective and impact Lue and his staff will have helps transform the team\u2019s DNA. The argument that the transformation responsibility should be on Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is a stronger one, and quite frankly, matters as much or more than anything the new staff brings to the party. 2019-20 finish: 35-39, 8th Western Conference, lost to the Lakers in first round Key offseason acquisitions: Robert Covington, Derrick Jones Jr., Ennis Kanter, Harry Giles 2020-21 outlook: The Golden State Warriors and Dallas Mavericks could stake their own claim to a top-four spot this season. But both have significant injury issues (Klay Thompson for the Warriors and Kristaps Porzingis for the Mavericks) to deal with. And the Phoenix Suns made their splash with Chris Paul, but sooner or later Neil Olshey and his front office crew in Portland will get credit for building the foundation they have around Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic. The Blazers have filled out their roster with type of talent and depth that pushes them over the top right now. The forward rotation of Covington, Derrick Jones Jr., Carmelo Anthony (re-signed), Rodney Hood (re-signed) and sleeper pick up Giles stabilizes the only spot on the roster that was vulnerable heading into the offseason. Gary Trent Jr. and Anfernee Simons have shown tremendous growth and fortify a second unit that would include Anthony, Hood and Kanter. That\u2019s depth the other contenders for this spot simply don\u2019t have as training camp nears.

Silas cited the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 protocols for Harden\u2019s absence Sunday from the team\u2019s first training camp workout, but on Monday the coach expressed ambiguity regarding the star guard\u2019s status. \u201cHe\u2019s not here, and he has a reason,\u201d Silas said. \u201cBut that\u2019s on him to tell whoever what the reason is.\u201d Silas said \u201cthere is no timetable\u201d for Harden\u2019s return, and called his absence \u201ca setback\u201d for a Rockets team working to come together with a new coach and several new players in John Wall, Christian Wood and DeMarcus Cousins. Silas said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Harden had even returned to Houston, where the rest of the team is taking part in training camp workouts. \u201cYou want your best player to be here,\u201d he said. Wall mentioned on Sunday that he\u2019s talked to Harden since Houston traded for him last week in a deal that sent Russell Westbrook and a future first-round pick to the Washington Wizards, and called their conversation a \u201cgreat talk\u201d. Houston forward P.J. Tucker, meanwhile, declined Monday to discuss the situation involving his teammate and friend. \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about P.J. Tucker,\u201d he said. Under contract for the next two seasons at least with a player option in 2022, Harden reportedly requested a trade earlier this offseason, but he hasn\u2019t addressed the media since September, when the Lakers ousted Houston from the playoffs in five games. Silas said last week that he hadn\u2019t spoken to Harden since the Rockets traded Westbrook for Wall, and maintained he wanted to give the 2018 Kia MVP \u201csome space,\u201d while expressing confidence the star guard would be \u201call-in\u201d for the start of training camp. Harden could be subject to fines for failing to report to training camp, but Silas said that option hasn\u2019t yet been discussed. \u201cI\u2019ve been in situations before where it was a holdout, and we just kind of handled each individual situation on its own merit and individually,\u201d Silas said. \u201cAs far as any sort of punishment, we haven\u2019t even crossed that bridge yet.\u201d Despite Harden\u2019s absence, excitement and expectations for the upcoming season haven\u2019t been tempered, according to Eric Gordon, who seemed to be careful with his words regarding his teammate. \u201cThe mood right now is everybody\u2019s pretty excited. It\u2019s definitely new,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIn the past, whatever guy that was here, whether you come off the bench or whoever, he had to come in and make a spark because we were in the zone of trying to win a championship. Now, we still have that same mindset. But it\u2019s a change of culture a little bit.\u201d *** Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

They were identical then, and in so many ways, identical now and very close. Markieff says: \u201cWe\u2019ve shared a room, shared a bed, shared the bathtub. Shared everything. It don\u2019t get no closer than that.\u201d They also share this profession, of course. Now starting their 11th NBA season, the Morris twins are introspective, often funny, mostly engaging and respectful \u2026 until they lace \u2018em up. At that point, they\u2019re long known for being badass, for which they are unapologetic. They are both 6-foot-8 power forwards who\u2019ve had flare-ups and fines but no fisticuffs \u2014 nobody\u2019s foolish enough to cross that line with them. Truthfully, the Morris brothers rarely instigate anything, but always respond when provoked. Los Angeles Lakers guard Jared Dudley, who was teammates with the twins in Phoenix during the 2012-13 season and knows them well, says: \u201cThere\u2019s a certain standard of how you\u2019re going to play them. Their approach is, \u2018Hey, you can beat me, you can score on me, but you\u2019re not going to bully me or be disrespectful in doing that.\u2019 They understand hard fouls and trash talking is part of the game, and if you bring that to them, they\u2019ll continue it and maybe take it to the next level.\u201d Much of this is from being raised poor in North Philadelphia by a single mother of six (the other siblings are boys, too: Donte, Blake and David). The neighborhood was unforgiving and kids in that environment either adapt or perish to the streets. The Morris twins learned to have each other\u2019s back, for protection and survival \u2014 essentially, Brotherly Love. They embraced football initially, but this being Philly, soon became entrapped by the city game. They played together in high school and then as a package deal at Kansas, and in 2011 were drafted in the first round, Markieff at No. 13 by Phoenix and Marcus at 14 by Houston. For 2 1\/2 seasons they were reunited, as teammates with the Suns (2012-15), before going their separate ways again. The Morris brothers aren\u2019t just enforcers. Marcus is a solid outside shooter, same for Markieff, and good rebounders and defenders as well. Dudley says: \u201cThey\u2019re the type of players you want on your team. They\u2019re good people and great teammates and that gets lost sometimes. They get along with everybody in the locker room.\u201d Now they share the same city, yet separate teams: Marcus with the LA Clippers and Markieff with the Lakers. There was a buzz the Clippers were interested in bringing the brothers together during free agency this fall but Markieff, after re-signing with the defending champs, wisecracked: \u201cThat was just talk, man. They were trying to scare the Laker fans.\u201d Which means they\u2019ll only share the Staples Center. With the season approaching, \u201cMook\u201d and \u201cKeef\u201d discuss childhood, reputations, their foundation, fatherhood, that takedown of Luka Doncic in the Orlando bubble \u2026 and playing in L.A. This is possibly the first Q & A (&A) in NBA.com history. We present the Morris twins, unrestrained. * * * Question: Both of you were free agents this offseason. How close did you come to being teammates with the Clippers? Marcus Morris: (Pause) Well, it didn\u2019t happen so he\u2019s happy where he\u2019s at. Markieff Morris: This was just the best place for me. Just trying to win back to back. That\u2019s what this is all about. Marcus, what was your reaction to your brother winning the championship, with the Lakers, of all teams? Marcus Morris: Him winning was mainly for our family. We\u2019ve been through a lot in this league \u2026 it took us back to where we grew up. Coming from where we were, to where we are now, that was a big accomplishment for the Morris family. Speaking of where you once were, while growing up in Philly, was anyone crazy enough to challenge one of you? Because that meant going through both of you, right? Markieff Morris: We used to fight m\u2014\u2013f\u2014\u2013s all the time. I\u2019ve been in situations where me and my brother would be fighting back to back, like an undercard and then the main event. You got to fight your way out of the \u2018hood. Marcus Morris: I remember we were in high school and he got into a fight. Everybody was expecting me to jump in. And I didn\u2019t. I said \u2018Naw, he can handle his business.\u2019 And he did. Markieff Morris: After a while they\u2019d leave us alone. M\u2014\u2013f\u2014\u2013s in the league know this, too. This ain\u2019t no gimmick. We\u2019re not trying to make guys scared of fighting us. That\u2019s who we are. Coming from Philly, that\u2019s what you do. Where did you get your toughness from? Marcus Morris: Well, my mom raised us to be hard working, get our work done. One thing she don\u2019t like is when we get technical fouls. That bothers her. Your family home went up in flames when you were in high school. Your AAU team held a fundraiser to help replace your clothes. You moved in with your grandparents in a small row house with no central heat and slept in a basement kept warm by a small kerosene furnace. Do you think about that much? Markieff Morris: The ceiling in the basement was about six feet from the floor so we couldn\u2019t stand straight up. There were twin beds that we just pushed together to make one big bed. It\u2019s what we had to do at that time. But it was easy for me to sleep in the bed with my brother. We been through worse. It was the sacrifice we had to make. Marcus Morris: There was really no complaining from us. Just to have somewhere to go, and to have the grandparents I had, that was the best thing. One thing is we don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. That\u2019s how we were raised. When that happened, we were like, well, let\u2019s take this basketball thing more seriously. And it all worked out in the end. Your grandfather was a big influence, right? Markieff Morris: Yes, he was old school. But it just wasn\u2019t him. We were raised by an incredible mom and grandfather and grandmom. They kept us going the right way. Have you always been by each other\u2019s side? When was the first time you were apart from each other? Markieff Morris: Before we went to Kansas, I spent one day of my life without him. It was a senior trip to Myrtle Beach and I didn\u2019t go. That was the only time. Then later on he was going to all the basketball camps, the LeBron camp and a few others, and I wasn\u2019t invited. Marcus Morris: Man, I remember that day in high school. It was different. First time I didn\u2019t see him. That day taught me not to take anything for granted. Markieff Morris: When we were drafted by different teams, we went our separate ways. Then when we were both with the Suns, he got traded . But we had been building each other up not to be together all the time. It was going to happen eventually. Let\u2019s talk about your image in the NBA as players who won\u2019t back down. Totally legit? Markieff Morris: People don\u2019t put it in perspective that this is our job. We play with passion. No matter how I may look, I\u2019m not angry in real life. I\u2019m angry out here. That\u2019s how everybody should be. What you see on the basketball court with us is totally different than what we are as people. Marcus Morris: I\u2019m not shying away from it. That\u2019s us. And that\u2019s why people love us. Out of everyone on this (Clippers) team, I probably talk the least. But when we step between the lines I\u2019m about action. I like it that way. You think you know me, but you don\u2019t know me. On the court we\u2019re bad m\u2014\u2013f\u2014\u2013s and off the court we handle our family business like gentlemen. You\u2019ve both been starters for much of your careers and dependable as well. That sometimes gets overshadowed, I imagine? Marcus Morris: A lot of people forget that. They think we\u2019re just out there to fight. Man, we don\u2019t last as long as we have in this league unless we can play ball. I was top five in 3-point shooting and averaged 20 points (in New York) before I got here (with the Clippers), and I\u2019ve been averaging over 14 points the last five years. It\u2019s not about what the outside thinks, anyway. It\u2019s about my family, my friends. Markieff Morris: That other stuff they say about us is just social media talk. Don\u2019t pay that any mind. There were a few incidents in the first round of the playoffs with Luka Doncic, the Mavericks All-Star, where Marcus was accused of purposely stepping on his shoe and also fined for a rough foul that sent him to the floor. What exactly happened there? Markieff Morris: Did you see what happened right before that? Luka is physical, too, and he talks a lot and whines to the refs. People see what they want to see. Marcus Morris: People thought I wanted to fight him. I\u2019m like, dude, trust me. I don\u2019t want to fight this man. I\u2019m happy for him. He\u2019s a great player, a competitor, I have no hate in my heart for him. I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him. Maybe we might be on the same team one day. The media paints a certain picture and I\u2019m used to it. But hey, I\u2019m a competitor and I don\u2019t regret anything that happens when put in that situation. Markieff Morris: They want to see Luka do well, we understand. Marcus Morris: I\u2019m going to bring the same intensity every year, every game. But a dirty player I\u2019m not. I hang my hat on coming to work every day. My teammates know what I\u2019m going to bring, and for 48 minutes, the other team knows I\u2019m going to give them a tough matchup and I\u2019m happy about that. What if this had happened during the 1980s NBA? Marcus Morris: They would\u2019ve been laughing. I was made for old school basketball. What kind of fathers are you two? Marcus Morris: We never had our dad growing up, so at a young age, we vowed we\u2019d be good fathers and men that our children can look up to. I had my second child, another boy. I want to help him grow and show him the way. Markieff Morris: I got a daughter now that I love, and if I get another one, I\u2019ll lose all my toughness (laughs). Your foundation is called Family Over Everything . Both of you are actively engaged in it, with camps for kids while your mom and Marcus\u2019 wife, Amber, take the single mothers out for pampering \u2014 pedicures, massages, etc. This hits close to home, right? Markieff Morris: God and family go hand in hand. That\u2019s all we preach. Our foundation focuses on families in need, single parent families, everything we do is based off family. Marcus Morris: My mom was always the neighborhood mom, she would always let my friends come over, and she got that from my grandmom. Well, this is what we try to do for others in return. I don\u2019t take credit for doing that foundation. We got that from our grandparents. You want to give these kids hope. OK, whenever it\u2019s Clippers vs. Lakers that means Morris vs. Morris to an extent. Is that uncomfortable? Markieff Morris: No. That\u2019s my job, competing at the highest level. He knows that. We\u2019re going to compete. Look, I want him to do fantastic. I want him to do un-freaking believable. But I want to win. If he can score 50, go score 50. And if I\u2019m here on the bench, OK, as long as we win, that\u2019s all that matters. We both want to win but I always want to see my brother do well. It didn\u2019t happen this summer, but would you both like to be teammates again? In a perfect world, shouldn\u2019t that happen? Marcus Morris: I would hope so. (But) he\u2019s in a great spot in L.A. and I\u2019m in a great spot in \u2026 L.A. (laughs). Well I guess it happened that we\u2019re at least in the same city. It\u2019s fun, man. It\u2019s fun. Markieff Morris: No matter how it turns out, we\u2019re stuck at the hip. * * *"},{"id":435481,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rookies-face-quick-turnaround-as-they-begin-nba-careers","date":"2020-12-07","title":"Rookies face quick turnaround as they begin NBA careers","content":"Clip three months out of your preparation time for anything, and it\u2019s probably going to mess you up. Go ahead, try it: Planning a wedding? Studying for a major exam? Navigating a pregnancy? You could get the shakes just thinking about the stress levels being dialed up. And that\u2019s what the NBA\u2019s Class of 2020 faces, now that they\u2019ve been thrust into their initial veteran training camps. Normally by this point \u2014 less than three weeks since they heard their names called by commissioner Adam Silver and deputy commish Mark Tatum \u2014 the league\u2019s crop of rookies would be in or headed to Las Vegas. NBA Summer League would have them competing with a bunch of other newcomers, second- or third-year guys and lots of hopefuls in games that mean nothing, all of them expected to make mistakes away from the NBA\u2019s biggest stages and hottest spotlights. Now? It\u2019s showtime, or very nearly so. Think about the 2019 Draft, when that year\u2019s prized prospects had 15 days after being selected to begin play in Vegas. They had 124 days or more ( nearly 18 weeks! ) between the night they found out where and for whom they\u2019d be working and that first regular season game. This year, from Draft till reporting for camp, they had all of 13 days. By Opening Night on Dec. 22, their prep time \u2013 no summer league, no early conditioning or strength work \u2013 will max out at 34 days. \u201cJust think, on the first day of camp, our rookies probably won\u2019t know the other players on the team,\u201d said Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers, heading into the weekend. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. And I guarantee you, they [the vets] won\u2019t know them. Dwight Howard, Joel [Embiid], they\u2019re going to come in, \u2018Who is this guy?\u2019 \u2018My name is [Tyrese] Maxey\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s going to be that type of scene.\u201d Losing those extra 90 days from what typically is the biggest adjustment period of an NBA player\u2019s career can\u2019t be good. Granted, the 2020 rookies won\u2019t know what they missed but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else \u2014 teammates, coaches, execs who chose them and fans \u2014 won\u2019t have to dial down their expectations. Probably. \u201cIt depends on your expectations,\u201d said Arturas Karnisovas, the Chicago Bulls\u2019 new executive vice president of basketball operations. \u201cIt\u2019s a crash course right now.\u201d The Bulls\u2019 prize rookie, Patrick Williams, was selected No. 4 overall despite not starting a game at Florida State. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s \u201ctwo years away from being two years away,\u201d to quote ESPN draft maven Fran Fraschilla\u2019s memorable line about Toronto\u2019s 2014 reach for Brazilian teenager Bruno Caboclo at No. 20. But Williams and his peers near the top of the lottery might be a few months away from being a few months away, given the pandemic-influenced timeline. \u201cIt\u2019s a crash course right now,\u201d Karnisovas said. Rookies typically face expectations in sync with their Draft position, which puts Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards front and center for how much he can do, and how soon, to get the Timberwolves off the Northwest Division\u2019s floor. The No. 1 overall pick already had a sweat going Sunday from a 30-minute pre-practice workout when he did his first Zoom media session, and did not flinch at the steep learning curve. With the Wolves holding their first team practice for 2020-21, Edwards said he already had gained knowledge defensively from individual work with assistant coach David Vanterpool. \u201cI\u2019m a quick learner,\u201d said the 6-foot-5 wing out of Georgia. \u201cSo I feel like I can take part in learning things very fast and on the go. I feel like it\u2019s important that I pay attention and be a sponge.\u201d Ryan Saunders, the Wolves coach, has a better feel for what Edwards is facing. Besides, his late father Flip, who coached 1,246 games for three teams in 17 NBA seasons, had a favorite saying: \u201cYou give players as much responsibility as they can handle.\u201d And for this Class of 2020, instead of \u201churry up and wait\u201d, they\u2019re having to \u201cwait and hurry up\u201d. Draftees whose college season ended back in March have had little or no opportunity to play 5-on-5 at all, never mind working out with their new employers. Said Saunders: \u201cAnytime you go from the high school level to the college level, the college level to the pro level, the pace of the game, the speed of the game changes. We want to do our job as a staff not to overload these players, especially after a longer hiatus. But also do our jobs to push these guys. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do with Anthony. He knows where we stand, he knows what we expect out of him. \u2026 We\u2019ll continue to monitor in terms of not only information overload but also physical overload.\u201d Edwards\u2019 teammate Karl-Anthony Towns is the last No. 1 selection (2015) to earn the Kia Rookie of the Year award the following spring. He\u2019s also one of three in the last 10 ROY winners to have done so as a one-and-done lottery pick, joining Andrew Wiggins (\u201914) and Kyrie Irving (\u201911). The other seven have had more experience, more time and more seasoning than nearly any of this year\u2019s rookies. Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, the 2012 ROY, spent four years in college. Michael Carter-Williams logged two, Malcolm Brogdon four and Ja Morant two. Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic, who won in 2019, began playing professionally for Real Madrid at age 16 in 2015. Then there\u2019s Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons, No. 1 picks who turned injury layoffs into extended prep work to win the award 22 months after they were drafted. Similar situations delayed the official rookie seasons of Joel Embiid and Denver\u2019s Michael Porter Jr. And nearly so for New Orleans\u2019 Zion Williamson, though his rookie status ended with the 24 games he played in 2019-20. \u201cMichael Porter has not played 82 games,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said last week. \u201cWhen I think about what Michael did in the Orlando bubble in the seeding games and then followed by a really spectacular rookie performance in the playoffs, I think his future is extremely bright.\u201d One year off, followed by the virus shutdown, meant that Porter\u2019s best work came 26 months after he was drafted in June 2019. So Malone, with a deep roster heavy with veterans, has modest hopes this season for Denver\u2019s top rookies Zeke Nnaji and R.J. Hampton. Washington forward Rui Hachimura arrived as the No. 9 pick last season and felt he had his hands full on a normal rookie schedule. \u201cThis schedule is crazy to me,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine if I was in this situation. There\u2019s no way I could be ready for it. \u2026 It\u2019s gonna be tough. You just need to be extra patient. \u201cFor those guys, even me, I think we should more ask questions. If you don\u2019t know anything, ask the coaches about anything. I think that\u2019s going to be the key.\u201d Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff thinks the short runway into 2020-21 will favor rookies who won\u2019t be lugging many scoring or ball duties. The same goes for newcomers who are especially good at rebounding, or defense. \u201cThe guys whose impact comes from scoring or being more ball-dominant, I think it will take them a little longer \u2026 to catch a rhythm,\u201d he said. James Wiseman, picked No. 2 overall by Golden State, was projected to provide quick help as a rim protector and glass cleaner. But the Warriors are going to go slow even with the 7-foot-1 center, who\u2019s still 19. \u201cJames has a lot to catch up on,\u201d coach Steve Kerr told reporters in a Zoom session last week. \u201cBut James\u2019 potential athletically is so dramatic that he\u2019ll have a chance to step in and help us because he\u2019s so athletic and dynamic. \u201cBut there\u2019s a ton to learn and he doesn\u2019t have the value of a summer league and a summer of workouts. I\u2019m excited for James, but also want to preach caution for everybody not to expect too much too soon. He played three college games.\u201d One good thing about this tightened schedule is that the notorious rookie wall might wind up delayed as well. Instead of smacking into it in February or March, the splat for so many might come in the spring. There\u2019s also something to be said for the mileage teams can get out of their rookies on sheer adrenaline, confidence and exuberance. Camp and preseason games may whoosh by, without too much grinding and humbling, after which their NBA careers finally will be underway. \u201cYou don\u2019t wait,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cYou get going. So we\u2019re gonna throw these guys right in from the first. In some ways, that may be good. They don\u2019t overthink. Some will struggle. I think for the rookies this year, the mental toughness factor will be gigantic.\u201d Chris Paul, the Suns\u2019 new veteran point guard, will have at least seven Phoenix teammates 10 years younger than him, including No. 10 pick Jalen Smith out of Maryland. \u201cSome times it\u2019s nice to have a young team because they don\u2019t know nothing else but to hoop, and to play hard,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey\u2019re not thinking about what can happen here or what can happen there. They\u2019re just on a roll.\u201d An unusually fresh roll this year. * * *"},{"id":435515,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nuggets-excited-to-add-facundo-campazzos-passing-toughness","date":"2020-12-06","title":"Nuggets excited to add Facundo Campazzo's passing, toughness","content":"To help the returning Denver Nuggets learn about their new teammates, coach Michael Malone started Sunday\u2019s first group practice of the season with a video that showed highlight-reel plays from the seven additions to the roster. Malone saved Facundo Campazzo\u2019s clips for last. And Nuggets center Nikola Jokic began cursing out his coach moments later. The reason: Jokic had already seen what the 5-foot-10 Campazzo can do at his best. Some of the clips that Malone picked out for the occasion just happened to be ones from the 2019 Basketball World Cup, where Campazzo put on a dazzling show that led Argentina past Jokic and Serbia in the quarterfinals. Soon, Malone hopes, Jokic and Campazzo will be teaming up for similar highlights. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you cannot fall in love with a young guy like Facu,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s small in stature, but like I said, you can\u2019t judge him by that. You judge him by his heart \u2014 which is very, very large. And he makes plays that most people don\u2019t even think about or see.\u201d Malone believes that with Jokic and Campazzo, the Nuggets now have two of the very best passers on the planet together on one team. That was just one of many reasons why Denver wanted Campazzo, whose exploits in the international game earned him the moniker \u201cThe Magician.\u201d And this fall, Campazzo was able to leave Real Madrid and sign a two-year deal with the Nuggets. \u201cI\u2019m finally here,\u201d the 29-year-old Campazzo said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy right now. I feel like a little child in this moment. This is a dream, you know, but I\u2019m just going to keep working. It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d Finding a Campazzo parallel \u2014 an NBA rookie who\u2019s almost 30 and with a listed height of under 6 feet \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly easy, either. Squeaky Johnson, 5-foot-10, was a few weeks shy of 29 when he debuted for New Orleans in 2011; he played 15 games. Charlie Criss, 5-foot-8, was almost 29 when his career started in 1978 for Atlanta; he stuck around the league for parts of eight seasons. Every other example goes back to the 1940s, the league\u2019s earliest days. Malone, however, doesn\u2019t sound the least bit worried. He joked that Campazzo will help him with his Spanish, but his primary hope is that he helps the Nuggets find a new level. \u201cHe\u2019s got great toughness,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very, very good defensive player, a disruptive defensive player, and on offense I think he has to be a top five pick-and-roll player in the world. The guy is a not a good passer \u2014 he is a great passer. He makes all of his teammates better. He\u2019s extremely unselfish, and that\u2019s why I think it is a seamless fit into our culture.\u201d Other NBA teams had talked to Campazzo about coming over to join them, but he preferred Denver because of his belief that the Nuggets \u2014 who went to the Western Conference finals this past season, successfully rallying from 3-1 deficits in each of their first two playoff series to get there \u2014 are title contenders. Campazzo has played in the Olympics twice, the Basketball World Cup twice and has a pair of EuroLeague championships. And in a few months, he hopes to add the NBA playoffs to that list. \u201cThe Denver Nuggets have a great team; they played very good last year,\u201d Campazzo said. \u201cThe playoffs, they usually go there, so that is very motivating for me and playing on a team like this one is very, very awesome for me.\u201d"},{"id":430648,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/media-week-2020-roundup","date":"2020-12-06","title":"Media Week roundup: Wall eager to team up with Harden","content":"The first preseason camps of the 2020-21 season opened Tuesday, with teams limited for the first few days to individual sessions with one coach and one player at one basket. Individual player workouts run from Dec. 1-5 with Media Week taking place during the same time frame. The following week, group player workouts begin (Dec. 6-10) in the lead-up to the start of the NBA preseason on Dec. 11. Below is the latest news and notable quotes from players and coaches as Media Week rolls on. Sunday Point guard John Wall said on Sunday he had a \u201cgreat talk\u201d with James Harden and the pair are eager to play together in Houston. However, according to coach Stephen Silas , Harden and P.J. Tucker missed the team\u2019s first group workout due to coronavirus protocols and would work out individually Sunday evening. Wall, who spent the last 10 years in D.C., said it \u201cfeels surreal\u201d not being with Washington, the team that drafted him with the No. 1 pick in 2010. But Wall said he\u2019s been 100% healthy since March and is eager to regain his All-Star status with the Rockets. As for Wall\u2019s parting words to former Wizards teammate Bradley Beal? \u201cThis is your franchise. Go be that franchise guy.\u201d What do you get the two-time Kia MVP on his 26th birthday? If your teammate is Giannis Antetokounmpo and he\u2019s yet to sign a maximum extension that would keep him in Milwaukee, the answer is easy \u2014 a pen. \u201cMe and [Pat Connaughton] thought the perfect gift to him from his teammates would be to give him a pen,\u201d Khris Middleton said on Sunday . \u201cSo, 19 pens in his locker for a birthday present. I told him those should be some of the best birthday gifts he\u2019s ever gotten. So, hopefully he enjoys it and uses it.\u201d \u2014 3:45 p.m. Saturday Michael Porter Jr. was a revelation in the Orlando bubble where he emerged as a key contributor for the Denver Nuggets during their playoff run. Now Porter Jr. is poised to take the next step as a full-time starter and the No. 3 scoring option behind Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic. \u201cI would love to start,\u201d said Porter, who averaged 22.0 points and 8.6 rebounds in the Nuggets\u2019 seeding games in Orlando. \u201cObviously, nothing is given to you, you\u2019ve got to earn it. But yes, I\u2019d love to be the starter.\u201d With key wing players like Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig no longer on the team, opportunity knocks for Porter Jr., who does not lack confidence or desire. \u201cI want to be one of the best players,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAnd I want to guard the best players and I want the best players on the other team to guard me.\u201d \u2014 6:50 p.m.  Tristan Thompson is expected to play a significant role for the Boston Celtics this season, but it might not happen right away. Brad Stevens says Thompson will miss most of camp because of a hamstring injury. \u201cHe had a hamstring strain from before he got here when he was working out in the last couple weeks. He\u2019s getting better,\u201d Stevens told reporters in a video conference. \u201cHe\u2019s done very light individual work with some strength and conditioning work but is not participating in any of our stuff other than that right now.\u201d The Celtics have begun full team workouts at the Auerbach Center in preparation for their Dec. 23 season opener against the Milwaukee Bucks. The goal for Thompson is to be ready in time for that game, though he might be a bit behind. \u201cWe hope to have him ramped up as we get closer to the start of the regular season,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to miss a significant portion of this training camp.\u201d \u2014 5:44 p.m.   Friday Carmelo Anthony struggled through stops in Oklahoma City and Houston before an unexpected late-career hiatus that kept him off the NBA courts for a calendar year. He found footing in Portland, providing a steadying and occasionally clutch presence during their thrilling bubble run to the through the Play-In Tournament. Anthony slotted into the starting lineup for the Trail Blazers, averaging 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds in 58 games. Portland then played an active hand during the offseason, and coach Terry Stotts informed Anthony he\u2019d be coming off the bench in 2020-21, with new additions Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. slotting in at the forward spots. \u201cI had to swallow that pill,\u201d said Anthony. \u201cIf I sit here and say that the thought of that wasn\u2019t hard or difficult to hear and take, does that play with your pride and your ego? Yes it does, especially coming for someone like myself. But I had to take a deep breath and we\u2019ll figure it out. We\u2019ll make it work.\u201d The 17-year veteran continued on to describe how the comfort and trust built up with the Blazers organization helped cushion a wholesale re-envisioning of his role: \u201cI\u2019m 18 years into this game. The only thing left is legacy. When you have people in the organizaiton that want to go side-by side with you through this journey and be a part of your legacy, it gives you a different type of confidence.It eases a lot of thoughts ahd questions.\u201d \u2014 8:21 p.m.  Clippers star Kawhi Leonard is known for his dry humor and efficient successes, and both were on display in his recruiting pitch to former Raptors teammate Serge Ibaka, a free agent alongside whom Leonard won the 2019 NBA championship. \u201cI talk to Serge here and there \u2026 Once free agency came, I sent him a text and told him clear as day: \u2018You coming here or not?'\u201d \u2014 7:11 p.m.  With the season starting up in New Orleans, guard JJ Redick is searching for a place to stay \u2014 his family remained at their home in New York. He\u2019s temporarily posted up with teammate Josh Hart, who\u2019s apparently been quite the gracious host: Redick, for his part, quote tweeted that \u2018None of this is actually factual.\u2019 He also revealed a new \u2019stache, in part a homage to new Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy, who was Redick\u2019s first NBA boss when he was drafted to the Orlando Magic in 2006. \u201cThere are a few factors going on here,\u201d Redick said, per Jim Eichenhofer of Pelicans.com . \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m here (in New Orleans) solo, (because) my family stayed in New York. My wife doesn\u2019t let me grow a mustache, so this seems like the perfect time to have a mustache. Two, I wanted to provide some emotional support for Stan in his first couple weeks on the job. So this is an homage to him.\u201d \u2014 6:47 p.m.  Wizards star Bradley Beal has been battling his emotions this week after his backcourt teammate John Wall was traded to the Houston Rockets for Russell Westbrook. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional week,\u201d Beal said, via Fred Katz of The Athletic . \u201cDefinitely been some tough 24, 48, 72 hours here, just kind of letting it all seep in and realizing that your brother is no longer here with you no more. He\u2019s off to something better.\u201d The duo played together for nearly a decade and even developed a relationship off the court. Wall has stated that when his mother died earlier this year, it was Beal who was the first person to visit him and provide support. \u201cYou are my brother 4L and that bond is way bigger than this game we play! We had amazing memories that\u2019ll always be cherished and never forgotten,\u201d Beal said on Instagram . On the court, the duo ranked high among the best backcourts in the NBA when healthy. Wall will return to D.C. when the Rockets play the Wizards on Feb. 15. \u2014 5:38 p.m.  Despite having the best record in the NBA last season, the Bucks came up short to the Heat in the Eastern semifinals. That disappointment may serve as fuel this season for Khris Middleton and Milwaukee. \u201cWe fell way short of our goal,\u201d Middleton said Thursday on a conference call. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of motivation this offseason to come back and be better.\u201d With Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo still in their primes, the time may be now for the Bucks to take that next step. \u201cThere\u2019s always a sense of urgency to win,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cWe gotta take advantage of this time while we can because that window is not as big or open as it used to be.\u201d \u2014 10:15 p.m.  DeMarcus Cousins held his first interview as a member of the Houston Rockets on Thursday and discussed why he won\u2019t complain about the adversity he has faced battling injuries over the past three years. \u201cI watched my mom work two jobs with six kids her entire life. So who am I to complain about some adversity? Life is full of adversity. Me going through the things I\u2019ve gone through, I will be prepared.\u201d Cousins also touched on his excitement to play with former collegiate teammate John Wall, who was acquired by the Rockets in a trade on Wednesday, and his overall excitement to get back on the floor, saying he \u201cfeels incredible.\u201d \u2014 4:16 p.m.  Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic is excited to get back on the floor after his young squad made noise during the 2020 NBA Playoffs and reached the Western Conference finals. \u201cExperience is going to be the most important key,\u201d Jokic said when explaining how he plans to improve during the 2020-21 season. \u2014 3:57 p.m.  The defending Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat will have a quick turnaround between their NBA Finals series against the Lakers and the start of the 2020-21 season. But that doesn\u2019t bother coach Erik Spoelstra, who addressed the situation during Heat media availability on Thursday. \u201cHistorically this is different,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quicker turnaround for those kind of teams, but if you consistently go to the Finals, guys like Golden State, all of LeBron\u2019s teams, our former teams, those were quick turnarounds. Finishing in late June and starting up in September. Regardless, those were quick turnarounds, but that\u2019s the price of chasing something great. It\u2019s much easier to be a lottery team, to be a losing team, to be a team that doesn\u2019t make the playoffs, be a team that just gets knocked out in the first round, that doesn\u2019t take a great deal of emotional expense or physical expense. \u201cOur season last year in many ways felt like three seasons,\u201d Spoelstra continued. \u201cThe training camp, and preseason, regular season. Then the quarantine and then gearing up for the bubble \u2014 then the bubble. We saw a lot of players really grow from that experience, particularly our young players. So we\u2019re excited that we have an opportunity to start another season. \u2018Yes, for some of our guys, particularly our veteran players, I will have to be mindful to keep them fresh, particularly mentally. They also have some experience enough to know how to manage themselves \u2026 you have to take some time building [a rhythm], and you don\u2019t want to skip steps, but you don\u2019t want to be mindful of the long haul as well.\u201d \u2014 11:58 a.m.  After losing Klay Thompson to season-ending Achilles injury, the Warriors\u2019 championship hopes are likely on hold for another year. Even making the playoffs this season would be a surprise to some. Stephen Curry is ready for the challenge. \u201cI hear it, but it doesn\u2019t sink home at all,\u201d Curry said Wednesday on a conference call. \u201cI didn\u2019t get big-headed when they picked us first in the league. I won\u2019t get overwhelmed with wherever they have us coming into this season.\u201d Curry, who hasn\u2019t played a meaningful game in over a year, is excited about the young talent on the Warriors\u2019 roster and is eager to prove the doubters wrong. \u201cI would hope that maybe some of the young guys, and our new guys who have a lot to prove in this league take it as the slight and chip on their shoulder, and we all kind of rally around that.\u201d \u2014 6:18 p.m.  Houston Rockets reserve forward Danuel House Jr. addressed the media Wednesday for the first time since the NBA announced in September that he\u2019d be forced to vacate the Orlando bubble for violating league protocols by inviting an unauthorized guest to his hotel room. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019d like to start out by apologizing to my team, the organization and the owner for the mishap that happened in the bubble,\u201d House said. \u201cI\u2019m focused, it\u2019s behind me, it\u2019s in the past. New year, new season, learning and looking forward to growing and expanding. I\u2019d like to deeply apologize to the fans also if you felt I let you down. Sincere apologies from me, Danuel House Jr. to everyone.\u201d House played just the first two games of Houston\u2019s 4-1 series loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals, after the league concluded through an investigation the forward had hosted an unauthorized guest in his hotel room at the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. The NBA announced in a statement that House would \u201cnot participate with the Rockets team in additional games this season.\u201d House started in 52 games for the Rockets last season, averaging 10.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists. A native of Houston, House said on Wednesday that he had \u201calready talked to the team\u201d about his transgressions in Orlando and expressed he\u2019s eager to move forward as the Rockets prepare to start the season with a new head coach in Stephen Silas and a new general manager in Rafael Stone. \u2014 4:48 p.m.  Chris Paul saw the talent in Devin Booker before either of them played for the Phoenix Suns. As Booker prepared for the NBA Draft in 2015, Paul got the chance to workout with the future All-Star in Los Angeles. The veteran point guard was a member of the Clippers at the time. \u201cWe had lost in the playoffs, but I had still wanted to hoop and train. So I went down and worked out with him. He was like 15,\u201d Paul said, laughing. (Booker was actually 18 at the time.) The workout left Paul impressed. Booker has since established himself as one of the best scorers in the league, with he and Paul playing together on Team LeBron in the 2020 All-Star Game. The duo is expected to be a formidable backcourt in Phoenix. \u20134:41 p.m.  The Zion Williamson show is set for season two. The 20-year-old told reporters that he feels healthy and is looking forward to the season under new head coach Stan Van Gundy. He praised the coach for his old-school approach, a style that reminds him of his step-father and Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. \u201cI can see his love and passion for the game,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI love stuff like that. I\u2019m very excited to work with him.\u201d \u2014 1:39 p.m.  Atlanta surrounded Trae Young with several new pieces this offseason, including a talented backcourt member in Bogdan Bogdanovic . The Serbian shooting guard, who averaged 15.1 points and shot 37% from deep last season, envisions a duo that will be hard to defend. \u201cI think teams are going to be really in trouble, guarding both of us together,\u201d Bogdanovic said, per Sarah K. Spencer of the Atlanta Journal Constitution . Bogdanovic said joining Atlanta as a restricted free agent was the perfect situation . The Hawks also added veterans Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn to a backcourt consisting of Young, Bogdanovic and former first-round pick Kevin Huerter. \u2014 11:15 a.m. Speaking with reporters ahead of training camp, Damian Lillard discussed life in the bubble, the Blazers\u2019 offseason changes and his desire to bring a championship back to Portland. Asked about his conversations with Neil Olshey, the team\u2019s president of basketball operations, Lillard related a sense of urgency as he enters his ninth season. \u201cLet\u2019s put ourselves out there to do whatever we can do to give ourselves a real shot, you know,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cLet\u2019s try to bring that glory back to Portland \u2026 It has been a long time and I want to be a part of that.\u201d So that\u2019s what the conversation has been. It\u2019s been transparent, you know, it\u2019s that simple.\u201d The Blazers added Robert Covington, Harry Giles III, Derrick Jones Jr. and Enes Kanter during the offseason. \u2014 8:42 p.m.  Speaking for the first time since signing a five-year rookie extension with the Celtics, said he\u2019s thankful for the opportunity to stay in Boston long term. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d Tatum said Tuesday as the Celtics tipped off training camp. \u201cI\u2019m extremely grateful and thankful; I don\u2019t take it for granted or lightly.\u201d Tatum, who set career-highs in points (23.4) and rebounds (7.0) last season, sees room for improvement entering his fourth NBA season. Tatum believes every part of his game can get better when it comes to efficiency, noting that he can continue to get stronger, extend his range, create off the dribble and finish through contact at a higher level. \u2014 7:25 p.m.  Sitting down for a Zoom conference call after his first individual workout, Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic tried to tame his long, disheveled hair. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cMy hair\u2019s not ready.\u201d Quarantine coif aside, Doncic made it clear that he has one goal this season: to win the NBA Finals a year after getting his first NBA playoff experience. \u201cEvery year I want to be better,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal for me. I also want to win the championship. That\u2019s the goal we entered last year. And that\u2019s the goal we\u2019re going to enter this year.\u201d After shooting only 31.6% from 3-point range last season, Doncic said he spent a good chunk of the offseason completing various shooting drills. \u201cUntil you\u2019re the best at something,\u201d Doncic said, \u201cyou always got to work on it.\u201d \u2014 6:28 p.m.  The Golden State Warriors will delay the start of individual workouts after two players tested positive for COVID-19, general manager Bob Myers announced on Tuesday. The team\u2019s individual player workouts will instead begin on Wednesday, with group player workouts beginning next week. The league stated in a health-and-safety protocol guide that was distributed to teams last week that any player who tests positive, even if asymptomatic, must wait 10 days and then be monitored in individual workouts for an additional two days. To return to work, both players must go 10 days or more after the first positive test or onset of symptoms or test negative twice at least 24 hours apart via PCR testing. \u2014 4:55 p.m.  The Brooklyn Nets had high hopes for 2019-20 after they reeled in free agents Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant in the summer of 2019. However, Durant never played a game for Brooklyn as he recovered from the Achilles injury he suffered in the 2019 Finals. Irving, meanwhile, appeared in just 20 games before an injured right shoulder ended his first season. The Nets have a new coach (and coaching staff, for that matter) in Steve Nash and he said in Tuesday\u2019s video news conference with the media that both Irving and Durant are looking sharp . Durant spoke with reporters as well on Tuesday and said he has been through a grueling process in recovering from his Achilles injury. But he added he is working out often with Irving and looking forward to being on the court again. Nash said he is still figuring out how the duo will be used in Brooklyn\u2019s two preseason games next week. In addition, he said there are no specific plans to sit either player during the 2020-21 campaign. However, Nash also said he believed it was unlikely the duo would play in all 72 games this season. \u2014 3:04 p.m.  The Minnesota Timberwolves no doubt delighted a large sect of their fan base by trading for former fan favorite and veteran point guard Ricky Rubio in the offseason. Rubio spent the first six seasons of his career with the Timberwolves and gave fans countless memorable moments. One of the standout moments associated with Rubio\u2019s tenure with the Wolves came back in the 2012-13 season in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on TNT. During the course of that game, Rubio was mic\u2019d up and a conversation he had with then-rookie guard Alexey Shved was caught on camera. In it, Rubio said to a disappointed Shved: \u201cChange this face. Be Happy. Enjoy.\u201d At Rubio\u2019s introductory video news conference Tuesday, he uttered his now-famous quote again \u2014 except he said \u201cChange that face. Be Happy. Enjoy.\u201d \u2014 1:11 p.m.  Earlier this month, a report surfaced that Indiana Pacers star Victor Oladipo was seeking a trade from the team during the offseason. However, Oladipo was quick at the time to say he remains committed to the Pacers ( per Shams Charania of The Athletic ) and doubled-down on that during Tuesday\u2019s interview session with reporters. Oladipo, a two-time All-Star and former Kia Most Improved Player Award winner, will be an unrestricted free agent in 2021. When pressed about his future with the Pacers, Oladipo was only concerning himself with the present. Pacers big man Domantas Sabonis did not participate in the NBA restart in Orlando because of plantar fasciitis in his left foot. However, he said he has no limitations from the injury and is ready to go for the 2020-21 season. \u2014 11:48 a.m.  The Washington Wizards lived through a 25-47 season in 2019-20 without the services of star guard John Wall. He has been out the last 1 1\/2 years because of two operations (to his left heel and left Achilles tendon) but said in May he is \u201c110%\u201d and itching to return. Wizards coach Scott Brooks spoke with reporters via Zoom about the status of Wall and he watched him workout in Los Angeles last month. Per Brooks, Wall is looking \u201cas good and as strong as he\u2019s ever been,\u201d and told reporters he is \u201cready to go\u201d for the 2020-21 season. Provided Wall is fully healthy, the Wizards have a promising core of talent that includes him as well as All-Star guard Bradley Beal and forwards Davis Bertans and Rui Hachimura. While the Wizards were a part of the season restart in Orlando, they ultimately missed the playoffs in 2020. Hachimura told reporters Tuesday, though, that he envisions Washington in the playoffs when the 2021 postseason gets going. \u2014 11:40 a.m."},{"id":435366,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/trail-blazers-close-facilities-after-positive-covid-19-tests","date":"2020-12-06","title":"Trail Blazers close facilities after positive COVID-19 tests","content":"The Portland Trail Blazers have closed their facility for deep cleaning after three positive COVID-19 tests came back in a span of four days.

The team did not say if the positive tests involved players, staff or some combination of the two. Portland is scheduled to open its preseason slate at home Friday against Sacramento, a game that \u2014 for now \u2014 is set to be televised nationally on ESPN.

Now the league has provided updated guidance detailing further restrictions at home and on the road, safety precautions for the NBA principals and their families, and discipline for violations that could affect other players, teams and the game schedule itself. Daily testing began last weekend in advance of training camps opening. Teams began required individual workouts Tuesday, with group activities starting this weekend. Among the key provisions in the initial document: \u2022 Occurrence of independent cases (not spread among players or staff), or a small or \u201cexpected number\u201d of COVID-19 cases will not require a decision to suspend or cancel the season. \u2022 Anyone who tests positive will have two routes to return to work: go 10 days or more after the first positive test or onset of symptoms, or test negative twice at least 24 hours apart via PCR testing. \u2022 Any player who tests positive, even if asymptomatic, will not be allowed to exercise for a minimum of 10 days and then must be monitored in individual workouts for an additional two days. \u2022 There are no criteria mentioned for what might prompt the NBA to suspend the season. \u2022 Team traveling parties will be limited to 45 people, including 17 players, as they make their way around the country to play a home-and-road schedule in NBA arenas. \u2022 As in the Orlando bubble, an anonymous tip line will be made available to report possible violations of safety protocols. The latest memo (distributed to teams Saturday, as reported by ESPN ) specified the NBA\u2019s response to and penalties for violation safety protocols. After the successful restart last summer to complete the 2019-20 season and postseason in the Orlando \u201cbubble,\u201d the league is tackling a more traditional \u2014 and potentially precarious \u2014 approach this season with in-market games, including travel and hotel stays. Details of the enhanced virus protocols and discipline policies include: \u2022 Players violating the safety guidelines may face a loss of pay proportionate to any lost availability due to quarantines or reinstatement steps. Other penalties may include formal warnings, fines, suspensions or educational sessions. \u2022 The NBA may conduct unannounced inspections of team facilities to ensure that franchises are complying with the safety protocols. \u2022 Once a vaccine is available, the league and the National Basketball Players Association will negotiate whether players, coaches and staff will be required to receive it. If it is not required, adjustments to the safety provisions \u2014 such as requiring more masking or testing of those who choose not to receive the vaccination \u2014 might be implemented. \u2022 While in their team\u2019s home market, team personnel will be prohibited from going to bars, lunges or clubs, from attending live entertainment or sports events, from using gyms, spas or pools, or from participating in social gatherings with more than 15 people. \u2022 On the road, players, coaches and staff will be permitted to dine outside their hotels if the restaurants provide outdoor dining, have fully privatized indoor rooms, or have met requirements to be formally approved by the league and the players\u2019 union. The NBA and NBPA will work to provide a list of at least three approved restaurants in each market. \u2022 Teams will designate traveling parties of no more than 45 people as \u201cTier 1\u201d members. Other employees and staff with less direct contact, requiring masks and social-distancing, will be classified as \u201cTier 2.\u201d Individuals in both tiers will be subject to daily coronavirus testing. The NBA also will provide twice-weekly tests for household members of players and staff. \u2022 Teams also face potential penalties for failing to comply with or failing to report violations of the mandated safety protocols. The NBA preseason schedule , featuring 49 games (two to four per team), begins Friday and runs through Dec. 19. The NBA\u2019s plan for a 72-game regular season starts Dec. 22 and ends in mid-May, with the 2021 Finals scheduled to be completed in July. The 2019-20 season was interrupted by a virus shutdown that lasted from March 11 to July 30. Play resumed with 22 of the 30 teams participating in eight seeding games, after which a Play-In Tournament for the Western Conference No. 8 seed was followed by the traditional 16-team playoff bracket. All games and activities of the restart were staged in a \u201cbubble\u201d at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World resort outside Orlando. The ambitious and costly (approximately $180 million) project saved the league an estimated $1.5 billion in additional revenue losses, while enabling the Los Angeles Lakers to be crowned as 2020 champions on Oct. 11. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

You can\u2019t cheat yourself or the game. It just doesn\u2019t work. So he\u2019s bringing all the same things that have made him one of the league\u2019s best and most mercurial talents over the course of his 12 seasons in the league to Washington. The non-stop intensity. The breathtaking plays, the breakneck speed and explosiveness. The snarl. The no-friends-in-other-uniforms mantra. The deep roots in the community and the off-court impact it produces. He packed it all. The blockbuster trade , which sent John Wall and a protected first-round Draft pick to Houston, provided a new place for Westbrook to start his 13th season. He promised Saturday that it\u2019ll be a familiar grind, though it will begin with a new jersey number (he\u2019s going from his customary 0 to his pre-NBA staple, 4). He hasn\u2019t practiced with the Wizards yet, but he\u2019s already studied his situation and prepared himself for the challenge of helping Bradley Beal end the organization\u2019s playoff drought at just two seasons. \u201cI\u2019m super excited about it man,\u201d Westbrook said on a Saturday afternoon Zoom call with reporters, his first public words since the trade went down. \u201cBrad is a superstar talent. He proved that and showed that last year with what he had. And he\u2019s only going to get better. My job is to come in here and continue to uplift him and push him to be better. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m here for. And I\u2019m happy to be his counterpart and to try and make the game easier for him and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try to do.\u201d Westbrook will ease into a situation with numerous familiar faces, from head coach Scott Brooks (who coached him from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City) to assistant coach Robert Pack and various members of the Wizards\u2019 training and medical staffs who also worked with the Thunder in the past. The difference, of course, is Russell was a much younger player then and in a completely different phase of his career. The methods might have been tweaked a bit over the years, a fact both Westbrook and Brooks acknowledged. But the discipline, diligence and goals have remained. \u201cThe great thing about me and Scotty\u2019s relationship is we always stayed connected. We always stayed in contact throughout my whole career,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cScotty was a huge part of the reason I\u2019m able to do some of the things I\u2019m able to do now. He gave me an opportunity and a chance to go out and make silly mistakes, some of the same mistakes I make today. He allowed me to do that and I\u2019m grateful for that because I learned so much about myself, about my game, who I am as a player. And I\u2019m just happy and excited to be back with him and to continue, obviously our friendship, and also be on the basketball court together.\u201d Brooks said the growth Westbrook has shown on the court has mirrored his tremendous growth off the court as a husband, father and one of the most active players in the league in terms of what he gives back to the community, back in his hometown of Los Angeles as well as Oklahoma City and Houston. \u201cThe greatest thing I always take away from playing days and even my coaching days is to see the maturity and the growth of every player or teammate and seeing them become husbands and fathers and all of that,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cGetting to reminisce with them about their families, their kids, their successes, off the court, to me is really cool. And to be able to do that and see that with all the players I\u2019ve coached, with Brad and his two kids and with Russell and his three kids and his wife, just to see that all evolve is really, really cool. \u201cBecause remember, I had Russell when he was 20 years old, he didn\u2019t know a lot about the ins and outs of being a husband and a dad. But you could just see it. My daughter always sends me clips from Instagram and all the stuff that\u2019s out there on social media. And it\u2019s really cool to see it. Like I said yesterday, he definitely has not improved his singing. I saw the one video where he was singing with all three of his kids \u2026 but to me, that\u2019s the biggest, the most important thing. The growth that I\u2019ve seen over the last few years and it\u2019s the coolest thing I\u2019ve seen as well.\u201d The experience of building the Thunder into a team capable of playing in The Finals, as they did in 2012 with Westbrook, Kevin Durant and James Harden \u2014 all future Kia MVPs \u2014 is the sort of bonding experience that lasts a lifetime. But this Wizards team is embarking on a completely different journey with a roster filled with inexperienced players (13 players have 3 or fewer years of NBA experience) still searching for their own niche in the league. That\u2019s a challenge Westbrook knows well and one that he\u2019ll be expected to facilitate for guys like second-year forward Rui Hachimura and rookie forward Deni Avdija, while also pushing, with Beal, to get the Wizards back into the postseason mix. And that\u2019s where Westbrook\u2019s on-court staples \u2014 his trademark competitiveness and seemingly boundless energy, even at 32 \u2014 become his tools of choice. \u201cI\u2019m genuine, I\u2019m a guy who likes to have fun and I also love to give, to give back,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a big thing for me just because the way I play the game, it kind of misconstrues for people who I am as a person and what I believe in and what I stand on. But obviously how I play and off the floor is two different people. When I\u2019m on the floor, you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t have any friends, I\u2019m not trying to be friendly. I\u2019m trying to bust somebody\u2019s [expletive]. I ain\u2019t got time to try to shake hands and do all that. I don\u2019t have time for it, and I\u2019m never changing that.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Lakers seem confident and collected as they head into team workouts this weekend, about eight weeks after they finished off the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals on Oct. 11. A distinct lack of vacation time aside, Los Angeles begins the new season in an apparently stellar position. LeBron James and Anthony Davis extended their commitments to the Lakers earlier this week, and they\u2019ll lead a slightly reconfigured roster that looks even better than last season\u2019s squad with NBA veterans Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Montrezl Harrell, Marc Gasol and Wesley Matthews. Before Frank Vogel gets down to the week-to-week challenges of keeping his veterans fresh, navigating travel during a pandemic and taking every opponent\u2019s best shot every night, the Lakers coach laid out a few guiding principles to his players at the team\u2019s training complex in El Segundo. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be even better,\u201d Vogel said Friday. \u201cThe first thing you have to understand about going into a repeat situation is it\u2019s going to be harder than the year before. The bull\u2019s eye is going to be bigger. We played longer than everybody else and had a shorter offseason than anybody else, so the odds are stacked against us from that standpoint. The identity of what and who we were last year has got to be repeated.\u201d Vogel is referring to the defensive excellence that set apart his Lakers, who created their own tenacious identity in the history of a 17-time champion franchise best known for the flashy offensive exploits of the Showtime 1980s teams and Kobe Bryant\u2019s 21st-century squads. With Davis leading the way, Los Angeles had the third-best defensive rating (106.1) in the NBA during the last regular season, and the Lakers kept it up in the playoff bubble. The Lakers lost major defensive contributors Avery Bradley and Dwight Howard to free agency, but Davis and Alex Caruso are back along with the four veteran newcomers, who can all excel on both ends. \u201cThe guys that we\u2019ve brought in here are nasty dudes,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cThese guys are all physical dudes that have that sort of edge to them that I think they\u2019ll embrace right away. Obviously the group that\u2019s returning knows the value in what we created last year, and hopefully we\u2019ll establish that early on.\u201d The Lakers\u2019 defensive dominance is centered around Davis, who agreed to a five-year contract worth up to $190 million Thursday to return. The 27-year-old Davis said he considered several contract options, but the combination of his happiness with the Lakers and caution about his health led him to ink the biggest possible deal. \u201cThis is the place I want to be,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to move on anywhere. I just thought what was best for me was to go ahead and lock it in. I want to be here. My family wants to be here. We\u2019ve got everything to compete for championships, so I just figured, why not be here?\u201d Davis also evaluated his physical condition frankly. He has missed a significant number of games due to injury in every season of his eight-year NBA career, and the athletic 6-foot-10 pro will be 32 years old when his new contract ends. \u201cI have to think about also the reality of things, too,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI do have a little history with injuries. \u2026 Do I get to that? God forbid, knock on wood, something happens. I want to secure the most amount of years possible and be here long-term with this team.\u201d The Lakers took another step toward maintaining last season\u2019s chemistry late Friday by re-signing guard Quinn Cook, who won his second career NBA title as a reserve contributor last season. Los Angeles waived Cook two weeks ago to save money, but brought him back as their 14th player to contribute bench scoring and leadership. Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka seems thrilled by the results of his roster-building work in the abbreviated NBA offseason. The former agent managed to retain his two most important players on long-term contracts while adding veteran talent and still making his roster younger. When the analogy-loving executive wasn\u2019t comparing the challenges of free agency to a 29-against-1 simultaneous chess match because he had recently watched Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Pelinka lavished praise on Davis, James and the four newcomers who agreed to join them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of really passionate guys and a lot of really high-IQ basketball players, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any lack of energy and intensity,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it in the building with our individual workouts. I think this team is excited to play, excited for the challenges of coming together for one of the hardest things to do in all of sports, which is defending a title.\u201d"},{"id":433913,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wizards-ready-for-fresh-start-with-beal-westbrook-culture-shift","date":"2020-12-05","title":"Wizards ready for fresh start with Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook culture shift","content":"On the surface, Wednesday\u2019s star point guard swap between Houston and Washington seems to make sense for both sides in a business of basketball sense. The Wizards send five-time All-Star John Wall (and a future draft pick) to the Rockets to team up with James Harden. The Rockets send former Kia MVP and perennial All-NBA pick Russell Westbrook to the Wizards to team up with Bradley Beal. It doesn\u2019t take long to dig up the silver linings on both sides. This is a transactional move for the Rockets, who have been here before with Chris Paul and then Westbrook, in an attempt to find the right fit alongside Harden in a quest to push the organization into a championship realm. Now it\u2019s Wall\u2019s turn to see if he can fit into that space and inspire Harden to continue his title chase in Houston. This is a cultural shift for the Wizards, an emotional parting of ways with Wall after a decade with the former No. 1 overall pick as the face of the franchise and a beloved figure in the D.C. community. \u201cRussell\u2019s resume speaks for itself,\u201d Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard said in a Friday Zoom session with reporters. \u201cIt was an opportunity to make the Washington Wizards a better franchise, bring a lot of amazing accomplishments to our franchise and leadership qualities to our team.\u201d Critics will point to Westbrook being the first league MVP to be traded in back-to-back seasons (from Oklahoma City to Houston and now from Houston to Washington) as a reason to be wary of his fit alongside Beal. The move has also been categorized as an exchange of slightly damaged but extremely high-priced goods, because of the massive salaries of both Wall and Westbrook. Sheppard and Wizards coach Scott Brooks aren\u2019t having it, as they took turns heaping tons of praise on Wall for his contributions on and off the court, and praising Westbrook\u2019s ability to do the same. \u201cTo acquire one of the very best point guards in the NBA you have to give up one of the very best point guards in the NBA,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cI don\u2019t take any of that lightly. And that\u2019s the decision I felt put the Wizards in the best possible position to be successful this season.\u201d This notion that this deal was some sort of even swap, however, does a disservice to Westbrook, who has been among the league\u2019s truly elite for the past decade. He\u2019s one of only four active players to have accumulated nine or more All-NBA honors, joining LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Paul on that list, and one of only 28 players in NBA history to achieve that feat. For all of the bellyaching about his fit alongside his old friend Harden, Westbrook was cooking last season before the March hiatus for the coronavirus pandemic. By the time the season resumed in the Orlando bubble, a positive COVID-19 test and a quadriceps injury derailed Westbrook\u2019s postseason as the Los Angeles Lakers ran the Rockets off the floor in the Western Conference semifinals. In the aftermath, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni departed, followed by general manager Daryl Morey, leaving Westbrook (who averaged 27.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.0 assists) as the convenient scapegoat for the Rockets doing the same thing they\u2019ve done consistently in the Harden era: coming up short in the playoffs. That\u2019s not to suggest that Westbrook is free from responsibility. He\u2019s never been the most efficient player and hasn\u2019t fostered friendships beyond his very tight circle of teammates, a quality that Wizards coach Scott Brooks witnessed first-hand as head coach of the Thunder from 2008-2015. In short, Westbrook\u2019s a ruthless competitor with little time for making nice with other players or media. Beal compared him to Paul Pierce, who came to the Wizards at the tail end of his storied career and imparted critical leadership traits for both Wall and Beal to soak up. \u201cWhen you\u2019re his teammate, you\u2019re his teammate,\u201d Beal said. \u201cIt was the same with Paul Pierce, right? He loves you to death. But when you\u2019re against him, all bets are off. He\u2019ll act like you are a bum on the street. He don\u2019t know you. So that\u2019s kind of the mentality he has when he comes on the court. He\u2019s going to disrespect you and he\u2019s going to attack you.\u201d It\u2019s a quality that Brooks believes has served Westbrook well over the years, and one that he\u2019ll bring with him to a roster with 13 players with three years or less of NBA experience. \u201cRussell\u2019s gong into his 13th year,\u201d Brooks said, \u201cWe have a lot of young players. Some of these guys were maybe 13 or 14 years old when Russell was just starting off and making a dent in the league with his toughness and style of play, a lot of us had never seen it before him. So I think he\u2019s going to demand their attention. \u201cI know when I was growing up my favorite player was Julius Irving. And when I got a chance to play for Philadelphia and I met him for the first time, I was like \u2018man, this is like my greatest day of my life.\u2019 And I know, playing for that team, I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him because I knew he was watching. It\u2019s the same thing with Russell. \u201cThese guys are going to have a lot of respect for him because they see how hard he plays, and they will see now how hard he works, You don\u2019t just become a good player overnight. It takes a lot of work. Russel is as high a level an athlete as I\u2019ve ever been around. He\u2019s just going to be a great example for all our players. He and Brad have so many similarities, it\u2019s just going to be fun to see it all take place.\u201d How Beal and Westbrook co-exist is the key for the Wizards, who joined the list of Southeast Division teams that includes Miami, Atlanta and Charlotte in making splashy moves in the days and weeks leading up to today\u2019s start of training camp. The sting of Wall\u2019s departure was still fresh for Beal, who considers Wall a \u201cbrother for life,\u201d after the first training camp practice Friday without Wall and with Westbrook in that familiar space. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional week,\u201d Beal said, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a tough 24, 48, 72 hours here. Just letting it kind of all seep in here and just realizing that your brother is no longer here with you no more. He\u2019s off to something better. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow. I never get into the game of playing GM. It\u2019s definitely a tough situation because John is my brother and our relationship goes far beyond basketball. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s so tough about it. We developed a bond since I was in high school. We\u2019ve had great years together and it was definitely kind of shocking to see the news the other day. But you understand it\u2019s a business. This is the business of basketball and Shep is the GM and he has to make these tough decisions and this is probably, definitely one of the toughest ones our organization has ever had to make.\u201d Beal continued by acknowledging the \u201cspark\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d Westbrook will bring. So much of the narrative about Westbrook has centered on how he co-exists with his superstar teammates, much of it a false misguided perception that they didn\u2019t enjoy playing with the player many people consider to be the most physically gifted point guard of this era. Kevin Durant won his Kia MVP with Westbrook as his point guard in 2014. Paul George had his best season, earned All-NBA first team honors and finished third in the MVP race playing alongside Westbrook in 2019. And the fact that Durant, Westbrook and Harden teamed up as youngsters to make The Finals in 2012 (where they lost to the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh-led Miami Heat) is proof that he\u2019s been able to operate at a high level in an ensemble. Sheppard and Brooks are betting on Westbrook being the perfect fit in a rebuilding effort centered around their rising star Beal, who finished second to Harden last season in the scoring race. Beal is all in on the seismic shift as well. Having been paired with Wall and knowing how often people tried to find cracks in their relationship and pit them against one another throughout the years, he knows how to avoid the nonsense. His new partner knows that routine well, having survived his own version of that drama in Oklahoma City with Durant and in Houston with Harden over \u201cwhose team\u201d it was? \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d Beal said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that he comes in with the energy and the focus that he always plays with. We just need him to play with that drive, that leadership and play like the MVP he\u2019s been playing like, because we have a lot of young, talented guys who are hungry to win, who are hungry to get better. \u201cAnd I think just Russ\u2019s energy and his approach, his mental approach to the game will be perfect for us. And I\u2019ll feed off of it, too. I have a lot to learn from him. He\u2019s a lot older than me. He\u2019s an MVP, a nine-time All-NBA, he\u2019s been there. So everything is there. It\u2019s just a matter of us putting the pieces together.

Does that sound like a contradiction? Well, yeah, but welcome to the complicated world of Los Angeles\u2019 non-championship basketball team, last seen limping home from Orlando after a disastrous bubble stay where the Clippers lost their grip on a handful of leads, both in games and a big playoff series, not to mention their credibility. The Clippers\u2019 goal is to distance themselves from that dreadful experience and reclaim their status in the league while ignoring the snickering around them. They are humbled, and perhaps still wearing scars from blowing a 3-1 advantage against the Nuggets and failing to reach the conference finals, and certainly anxious to recalibrate following a string of personnel changes. Gone is coach Doc Rivers, who couldn\u2019t generate or sustain any momentum for his team as it crumbled under the weight of title expectations. The level of blame that fell on Rivers is certainly negotiable, and the conversation about that was revisited the other day when Paul George seemed to bury Rivers while speaking on a podcast, saying the Clippers never made any adjustments against the Nuggets and also questioned his role under Rivers. George moonwalked most of it back Friday in his first lengthy meeting with reporters, perhaps because George himself was a big reason the Clippers couldn\u2019t hold that lead. \u201cWe all take responsibility,\u201d George said. \u201cMe being one of the top players on the team, I wasn\u2019t at a peak performance. The fact I gave up a 3-1 series sits with me and haunts me. I want to clear things up. I respect Doc. Doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything we did, but it does not belittle the fact that I respect him in that position. I said what I said \u2026 the notion that I don\u2019t respect Doc and put the blame on Doc, (that\u2019s) not the case. I\u2019m to blame in that situation as much as anybody else. Let\u2019s not let that get out of hand and make that a story.\u201d George had more turnovers than buckets in Game 7 against Denver and didn\u2019t shoot well in that series or LA\u2019s first-round battle with Dallas. But it was certainly a team-wide collapse. Montrezl Harrell was exposed as a poor defender \u2014 which factored in the Clippers\u2019 decision not to re-sign the reigning Kia Sixth Man Award winner \u2014 and Lou Williams made a regrettable side trip while leaving the bubble to attend a funeral. Usually, a playoff exit rarely is catastrophic enough to follow a team into the next season, but this was bad and the offseason was short, and so here we are. For the Clippers, there will be only one more uncomfortable reminder of the bubble. That\u2019ll come opening night when they\u2019ll watch the Lakers raise a 17th banner. Roughly a year ago this time, the Clippers were a bigger favorite to raise their first banner inside Staples Center but, as they say, stuff happened. The responsibility now falls on Ty Lue, a protege of Rivers, who assumes the coaching role and must figure a way to get the Clippers to reach their potential. At least he has one advantage Rivers didn\u2019t: The Clippers will start full squad training camp practices with a healthy contingent of players. George missed all of camp last season following shoulder surgery and Kawhi Leonard also was in and out while protecting his body. And while the Clippers managed to add rotational pieces in Serge Ibaka and Luke Kennard last month, their fortunes once again will be largely determined by the health and performances of their stars, Leonard and George. There\u2019s also a bit of urgency regarding those two: They can become unrestricted free agents next summer, although George all but pledged his future to the Clippers; take that for what it\u2019s worth here in December. \u201c I want to retire a Clipper ,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m committed, I\u2019m here, this is where my heart is and I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d Of course, George echoed similar words the year prior to requesting a trade from Indiana, and then did the same last summer from Oklahoma City. Also, if George were to leave the Clippers, it would be crippling for a franchise that surrendered a batch of assets in the form of players and future draft picks to get him. But for now, he does agree the burden falls on him and Leonard. \u201cIt has to start with us, as a pair and a duo, and from there we force that upon the team,\u201d he said. About his own reputation, which absorbed a sledgehammer of a battering in the bubble, George was contrite: \u201cI\u2019m my toughest critic. I know what\u2019s not good and not acceptable. Last year was not a good year for me and I know that. It was a rough year for me, a down year for me. I\u2019m only 30, still got time, got a lot of years in the tank. What happened last year gave me a big motivation coming into this season. \u201cI just had an offseason to train; I didn\u2019t have one going into (last) season. I got my offseason back so I feel really good. I\u2019m in a great place. I\u2019m comfortable and that\u2019s when I\u2019m at my best. I know the guys, got a great coach, great staff, great locker room.\u201d Leonard took some shots at his team on the way out of the bubble, questioning the decision-making and execution, and certainly took those concerns to management. He had a strong season, his first with the Clippers, and made All-NBA. But like George, he also wasn\u2019t sharp in the Game 7 moment of truth against Denver. Leonard said: \u201cI\u2019m definitely motivated. I want to win. I\u2019m doing steps to maintain my body to stay ahead of the curve. The road going to a championship is hard. But I love the process. We\u2019ll see how strong we are and how we can build from this. This is what makes players.\u201d Both George and Leonard endorsed Lue, although Leonard did hedge from putting a healthy level of importance on the coaching change by saying, \u201ca coach can\u2019t put a battery in your back and tell you to play hard.\u201d He conceded: \u201cIt\u2019s a different start with Ty.\u201d And so that\u2019s where the Clippers are at the moment, which, while the revamped team remains unproven, at least the few months off allowed for a more upbeat attitude to permeate the franchise. Based on the nightmare they went through in the bubble, the Clippers will take it. \u201cIt\u2019s all about starting this year off right, making sure it\u2019s a winning attitude and environment,\u201d said George. \u201cIf we put winning first, everything will iron itself out.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The night on Nov. 29, 2008, he gave Russell Westbrook his first career start, putting him at point guard even though there were questions about whether the talented rookie could play that position. The Thunder won. Brooks and Westbrook were off and running, joined at the hip, winning 62% of their games together over the next six years and getting to the NBA Finals in 2012. They\u2019re now reunited in Washington, with Westbrook going to the Wizards earlier this week in a trade that sent John Wall to Houston. \u201cRussell never gave me any reason to ever have any doubt in his ability,\u201d Brooks said Friday, shortly before the Wizards had their first training-camp practice. \u201cThere were many times, early in his career, I was being asked, \u2018Why are you doing this? Why are you doing that? He\u2019s not a point guard, he\u2019s not this, he\u2019s not that.\u2019 And that was all fine. \u201cI didn\u2019t care what the people were telling me what he\u2019s not. I saw and I coach what players do. And he was my point guard.\u201d And now, he is again. Westbrook has made the NBA Finals just the one time back in 2012, when the Thunder lost to the Miami Heat. Even at 32 years old now, Westbrook is still dynamic \u2014 he averaged 27.2 points last season playing alongside NBA scoring champion James Harden in Houston. He shot a career-best 47% and had eight triple-doubles, pulling him within 35 of Oscar Robertson\u2019s career record of 181. But something that he did off the court, and intended to do quietly, wound up really piquing the Wizards\u2019 interest. Westbrook left an $8,000 tip for the housekeepers at Walt Disney World when Houston\u2019s time in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble. Washington general manager Tommy Sheppard had clamored for a chance to land Westbrook for years, and hearing about that gesture made him want to bring him to the Wizards even more. That tip is pocket change for Westbrook; he\u2019s slated to make about $41 million this season. But to Sheppard, it still spoke to his character. \u201cWhen I look at what a player is about some things really speak very loudly to me,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cAnd I had no reservations whatsoever about the player we were acquiring. Russell kind of carries himself in a way that if you\u2019re not on his team, he doesn\u2019t let a lot of people inside. \u2026 But hearing a story like that, that\u2019s a Wizard, that\u2019s something that we really want here.\u201d It came at a big cost. Wall was beloved by the Wizards and their fans. But he\u2019s missed nearly two full years with injuries, Westbrook wanted a change of scenery and the gamble \u2014 if they even consider it one \u2014 was obviously something the Wizards felt was worth taking. And in the end, Washington still gets a super-talented backcourt as it looks to rejoin the Eastern Conference playoff mix. Instead of Wall coming back and playing alongside Bradley Beal \u2014 who averaged 30.5 points last season \u2014 it\u2019ll be Westbrook. \u201cIt was a tough pill for me to swallow,\u201d Beal said of the trade and seeing Wall leave. \u201cBut on the flip side of it, you look at it and see who we\u2019re bringing in and you see the caliber of player of Russ, and what he\u2019s able to do, a former MVP, a walking triple-double. He\u2019s going to bring a spark to our team and an energy to our city.\u201d Brooks said it\u2019ll be an adjustment working Westbrook into the mix. But he also sees the obvious similarities between a healthy Wall and Westbrook, so he can envision what it\u2019ll be like when Westbrook and Beal start to really click. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a pretty good, pretty seamless transition of bringing Russell into the group,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cKnowing Brad for four years, there\u2019s a lot of similarities. These guys are tough, they\u2019re team guys, they\u2019re determined guys, they have a big-time drive, their work ethic, their professionalism, what they\u2019re about off to court. They remind me of each other. \u2026 Those two guys have the great ability of making the three other players on the court with them much better.\u201d"},{"id":433911,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/paul-george-i-want-to-retire-a-clipper","date":"2020-12-05","title":"Paul George: 'I want to retire a Clipper'","content":"Paul George grew up rooting for the Los Angeles Clippers and he loves playing close to home. He made it clear Friday where he sees his NBA future, saying, \u201cI want to retire a Clipper.\u201d \u201cThis is where my heart is and I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said. George\u2019s first season back home ended in disappointment, with the Clippers blowing a 3-1 lead against Denver and losing in the second round of the playoffs. He averaged 21.5 points and 5.7 rebounds during the abbreviated season. George wasn\u2019t able to train normally during the 2019 offseason or participate in his first training camp with the Clippers after shoulder surgeries. He missed the first 11 games of the season, too. \u201cI\u2019m my toughest critic,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what\u2019s not good, what\u2019s unacceptable. Last year was an unacceptable year for me. I know that.\u201d George and teammate Kawhi Leonard can become free agents after the upcoming season. New Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said he expects both players to be with the team for a long time. The team doesn\u2019t have to wait until next summer with George; it could sign him to an extension before then. \u201cI\u2019m committed,\u201d he said. While declaring his loyalty to the franchise, George also took the opportunity to clarify comments he made earlier this week on the \u201cAll That Smoke\u201d podcast. He said the Clippers weren\u2019t prepared enough against Denver and former coach Doc Rivers didn\u2019t utilize George\u2019s strengths in the series. Rivers was fired after the team\u2019s early exit and now coaches Philadelphia; Lue was elevated from Rivers\u2019 top assistant to being head coach. \u201cI do want to clear it up because the notion out there is I don\u2019t respect Doc and I\u2019m putting the blame on Doc,\u201d George said Friday. \u201cI respect Doc. I think Doc is a helluva motivator and coach. It doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything that was done. They played harder than us and ultimately got past us.\u201d George cited inconsistency as the reason for much of what went wrong last season \u2014 lack of time together in practice, injuries and players leaving the bubble in Florida for personal reasons. \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself. I wasn\u2019t able to do the things I was good at or I was comfortable with because my shoulders weren\u2019t at peak performance,\u201d he said. But things are different now. George said his body feels good again and he\u2019s been putting a lot of hours in on the court. \u201cI knew last year was a rough year for me. The good thing about that is I\u2019m only 30, I still got a lot of years in the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me a big motivation going into this season. I\u2019m ready to dive right into this and give everything I have.\u201d Leonard is, too, describing himself as \u201cdefinitely motivated.\u201d \u201cPhysically, I feel good. I want to get back out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe road to a championship is hard. I love the process.\u201d The Clippers will test themselves right out of the gate, playing the NBA champion Lakers as the visiting team at Staples Center in the season opener on Dec. 22. George and Leonard will be surrounded by a changed supporting cast. Montrezl Harrell, the Sixth Man of the Year, signed with the Lakers and JaMychal Green went to Denver. The Clippers added free agent Serge Ibaka, who played with Leonard in Toronto, and Luke Kennard. \u201cWe brought in some good talents, some good veterans,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cSerge will be great for us. He\u2019ll be a rim protector, he\u2019s been in big moments before and can shoot the ball.\u201d The Clippers brought in George and Leonard to win a championship, something that has eluded the franchise throughout its existence. They\u2019re determined to write a different ending in year two. \u201cOur ultimate goal is just make sure this is a winning environment,\u201d George said. \u201cThen everything will iron itself out.\u201d"},{"id":433787,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/8-duels-we-cant-wait-to-see-including-lebron-vs-durant","date":"2020-12-04","title":"8 duels we can\u2019t wait to see in first half of 2020-21","content":"Even before the NBA released the first half of the 2020-21 schedule on Friday, we salivated over some of the anticipated matchups given that so many players are returning from injuries, while others joined new teams. Here\u2019s a look at eight of the duels from the first half of the NBA schedule that we couldn\u2019t wait to see: Editor\u2019s note: All head-to-head records are based off regular season matchups. When: Thursday, Feb. 18 (10 ET, TNT) It\u2019s hard to believe we haven\u2019t seen these superstars match up since Christmas of 2018, when James scored 17 points to go with 13 rebounds and five assists in 21 minutes before leaving a Lakers win over the Warriors in the third quarter due to a groin strain. But here we are. Now, we\u2019re looking at a totally different Lakers squad facing off against a totally revamped Brooklyn Nets squad headlined by a pair of stars in Durant and Kyrie Irving. This game could possibly serve as a preview for the 2021 NBA Finals. So, we\u2019re hoping to see both of these superstars on the floor for this one. Head-to-head record: LeBron James, 15-6  When: Tuesday, Dec. 22 (10 ET, TNT) The battle for L.A. starts early this season just like it did last year when the Clippers bested the Lakers 112-102 to spark a heated national debate about which team was the favorite to capture the title (we saw how that played out). Coming off a championship and a short offseason, James could be limited. If we miss out on this matchup, there\u2019s plenty more storylines to keep an eye on with reigning Sixth-Man of the Year Montrezl Harrell leaving the Clippers to join the Lakers and Leonard\u2019s former Toronto teammate Marc Gasol also joining the purple and gold. Head-to-head record: Kawhi Leonard, 8-5  When: Sunday, Jan. 17 (8 ET, NBA League Pass) Honestly, this matchup probably deserves top billing when you look back on the epic duel these players staged in the opening round of the Western Conference Playoffs, knocking down 65 3-pointers in the series while combining for 475 points. Their combined production broke the NBA record that Jerry West and John Havlicek set in the 1969 NBA Finals . \u201cAnd then I get into that zone of just not missing, and the team relying on shooting and everything,\u201d Murray said to Quentin Richardson on the Knuckleheads podcast. \u201cLike, nobody could stop each other. So, I come down and hit two 3s in a row. Then, he comes down and hits two 3s in a row.\u201d You get the gist of what we\u2019re expecting in this matchup between a couple of young scorers in their primes? Both teams play again on Jan. 31 on NBA TV. Head-to-head record: 5-5  When: Wednesday, Feb. 10 (7:30 ET, ESPN) We kept hoping for this matchup last season, but it never materialized due to injuries. If healthy, we\u2019ll see these budding stars battle twice in one week in February. The Mavericks improved their defense over the offseason, while Atlanta loaded up on offensive firepower to play alongside Young. Let\u2019s keep in mind these players will be forever linked after they were traded in 2018 for one another. They played twice as rookies, with both logging 24-point double-doubles in their last matchup. But we never saw them face off again, which might have been for the best since the Hawks and Mavericks were trending last season in opposite directions. The rising stars will likely put on a show. Head-to-head record: 1-1  When: Tuesday, Dec. 22 (7 ET, TNT) A couple stars and former Warriors teammates returning from major injuries should be making their debuts here on opening night. We last saw Durant play in the 2019 NBA Finals, and Curry hasn\u2019t hit the hardwood for a live NBA game since March 5. The league\u2019s quick turnaround shouldn\u2019t drastically affect either player, considering the considerable time they\u2019ve been away. But keep in mind it\u2019s just the season opener, and you can bet Steve Kerr and Steve Nash will be looking to manage the minutes of these star players as much as possible. Look at this as just a preview of what\u2019s to come from a couple of players that could be right in the mix when it comes to the Kia MVP conversation. Head-to-head record: Kevin Durant, 14-9  When: Tuesday, Dec. 29 (7:30 ET, TNT) Jimmy Butler and the Heat jumped in and stole away the Eastern Conference title that Milwaukee was favored to secure last season and did it in dominating fashion (4-1). The Bucks added some help for Antetokounmpo this offseason in guard Jrue Holiday. But let\u2019s not forget that Butler put together 30- and 40-point nights in two of Miami\u2019s postseason wins over the Bucks, before Antetokounmpo sat out of the series-deciding Game 5 due to a sprained ankle. Both players have averaged 18.9 points in their head-to-head regular season contests. Head-to-head record : Jimmy Butler, 12-7  When: Friday, Jan.8 (7:30 ET, ESPN) You may disagree with the way LaVar Ball delivers his messages, but let\u2019s give the man his flowers for shepherding all three of his sons \u2014 Lonzo, LaMelo, and LiAngelo \u2014 into the NBA. You\u2019ve got to think LaVar will be the proudest father (and rightfully so) on Earth when LaMelo, the third pick of the 2020 NBA Draft, clashes with big brother Lonzo, the No. 2 pick of the 2017 draft. Big brother Ball leads a more talented team, as New Orleans might finally be back in the mix for its first postseason berth since the 2017-18 season. Although these brothers haven\u2019t yet played against one another in the NBA, we\u2019ve already heard plenty of debate about which is the better player. Expect that to continue after this one.  When: Tuesday, Jan. 26 (8 ET, NBA TV) We get an early glimpse at which team received the better end of the trade between these players during this lightning-quick offseason. Westbrook leads his third team in as many years against a superstar in Wall, who hasn\u2019t played since Dec. 26, 2018 due to a couple of season-ending injuries. Houston isn\u2019t even yet sure whether Wall is even fully healthy and ready to go, but new coach Stephen Silas should have a pretty good idea Sunday when the Rockets open training camp. Hopefully by the time this game pops up on the schedule, Wall is catching a groove in Houston because this matchup should provide some fireworks if he and Westbrook are healthy.

In some instances where a team is scheduled to play twice in one market, those games have been scheduled to be played consecutively. Each team will play an average of four \u201cseries\u201d in the First Half \u2013 two at home and two on the road. Additional steps include more instances of teams playing consecutive road games against teams that are geographically close, and roughly 50% fewer instances of teams making single-game road trips. As part of a continuous effort to present national television games to the largest possible audience, the NBA worked closely with its teams and domestic broadcast partners to schedule earlier start times for doubleheaders. During the First Half of the season, each doubleheader across TNT and ESPN will tip off at 7 p.m.\/9:30 p.m. ET or 7:30 p.m.\/10 p.m. ET.

Alas, Simmons was just joking when he said he moved in with Embiid \u2014 who welcomed his first son with his girlfriend in September \u2014 so the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 All-Stars could tighten their bond. Simmons is good with Embiid, the max-contract cornerstones of a franchise that has not yet reached the championship heights so many expected when they were drafted two years apart. As for the rest of the team, the Sixers are ready to hit the reset button in coach Doc Rivers\u2019 first season running a team that netted them just the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and a first-round exit. Former Sixers guard Josh Richardson, traded to Dallas in the offseason, lamented in August the underachieving season could be pinned on a lack of accountability from management to the roster. Simmons said Richardson was right and the Sixers were not ready to compete for a title when the NBA restarted the season in the Disney bubble. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in a position to go into the bubble and win,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI think our mindset was off. Accountability is a huge part of winning. I think he\u2019s definitely right. Bringing Doc and all of these guys in, Doc\u2019s team, with all of these coaches around, the maturity has definitely risen with the team. It\u2019s been great to see that and see guys be accountable for certain things, and come here ready with a different mindset.\u201d Boston swept the 76ers in the postseason and ended former coach Brett Brown\u2019s reign after seven seasons that put him in charge of the lose-first Process era to consecutive 50-win seasons and berths in the Eastern Conference semifinals. So what was the problem in the bubble? \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t just come into a situation like the bubble if you guys aren\u2019t ready and don\u2019t have that chemistry and accountability already,\u201d Simmons said Friday. \u201cDoc and I have spoken about it already. You can tell the teams that were doing well in the bubble were tight-knit and held accountable for certain things going on. You kind of see it with the Clippers now, things that are coming out.\u201d Whoa, wait a minute. The Clippers? The same team Rivers coached last season that blew a 3-1 playoff series lead in the Western Conference semis and led him to leaving Los Angeles? The Clippers were painted in a story this week on The Athletic as an organization without any, well, accountability where star players called the shots and Rivers did little to reign them in. Clippers star Paul George even said in a separate interview Rivers failed to make the necessary adjustments to stop the losing and lead the Clippers into the next round. Simmons said accountability \u2014 the new buzzword in Philly \u2013 starts with the players. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much that can happen with players and coaches and that\u2019s on the players to make sure they\u2019re held accountable, and if they\u2019re not gonna listen and do certain things, they\u2019re not gonna win,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us, being younger guys, to have somebody like Doc come in. We gotta get it done.\u201d The Sixers also hired former Houston executive Daryl Morey to run basketball operations and gave the franchise a draft-night overhaul with deals that rid them of Al Horford and Richardson and brought in sharpshooter Seth Curry and drafted Kentucky guard Tyrese Maxey. Simmons says he\u2019s 100% healthy following surgery on his left knee in August that kept him from playing in the postseason. He averaged 16.4 points, 8.0 assists and 7.8 rebounds in his third full season. Simmons expressed excitement about being coached by Rivers, who led the Celtics to the 2008 NBA championship. Rivers threw his support this week behind Simmons and noted, \u201cI don\u2019t care about Ben\u2019s shooting as much as so many other people seem to care about it.\u201d The 24-year-old Simmons has been the primary ballhandler for the Sixers for the bulk of his three-year career, but the 6-foot-10 triple-double threat played power forward when the NBA season resumed in the bubble. \u201cI\u2019m a player, man,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThere\u2019s no, one, two, three, four, five with me. I don\u2019t really think you can put me in a position because of my talents and what I\u2019m able to do. I think Doc would say the same thing, I go out there and make plays.\u201d"},{"id":433638,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/like-its-time-in-bubble-nba-embarks-on-more-uncharted-waters-in-2020-21","date":"2020-12-04","title":"Like its time in bubble, NBA embarks on more uncharted waters in 2020-21","content":"Any season branded with \u201c2020\u201d into its name is bound to be different. Challenging. Unpredictable. Filled with surprises, frustrations and disappointments. And we\u2019re not even talking about the basketball yet. Embarking on the 2020-21 NBA season feels a little like what Magellan, Da Gama and Columbus must have faced back in the 15 th and 16 th centuries\u2019 Age of Discovery. You take crude maps and faulty telescopes into a sea of unknowns, round up the bravest crews you can find and load up 30 ships, knowing all the while only one will return to port when the adventure is over. In the NBA, if that attrition is the result of familiar competition crowning a championship team next summer, hey, mission accomplished. If it\u2019s more the result of viral contagion, then maybe not so much. \u201cWe talked about it [Monday],\u201d Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens said in a Zoom session this week, \u201cembracing the unusual circumstances to get a chance to play the game we love is certainly totally worth it and something we look forward to, no matter when the season starts and how much time we\u2019ve had off.\u201d Most teams had more time off in the midst of last season than they\u2019ve had now between seasons. For the Lakers and the Heat, it\u2019s been about seven weeks \u2013 which would be like starting in early August after a traditional Finals. Denver coach Michael Malone called this \u201cthe shortest offseason in the history of pro sports.\u201d And his Nuggets don\u2019t have the same continuity as in recent seasons, adding seven players to their roster. \u201cToday is the first day of training camp,\u201d Malone said Tuesday. \u201cAll individual workouts. We have \u2018Track 1, Track 2.\u2019 We have \u2018Tier 1, 2 and 3.\u2019 We have so many groups and tracks and tiers, I don\u2019t even know what the hell\u2019s going on half the time. I can tell you this: Our first team practice on Dec. 6 will be the first day that most of our new teammates will meet their current teammates. That\u2019s crazy. And then we have our first preseason games six days after that. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going through it. Instead of wasting energy complaining about it, we just have to embrace it.\u201d From start to finish, 2020-21 is going to be different. The one thing players, coaches, front office staffs and the folks at league headquarters know is that they don\u2019t a whole lot right now. \u201cWhat I do know is everybody involved is working daily to try to figure things out,\u201d said Phoenix\u2019s new veteran point guard Chris Paul , who serves as president of the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cOnce again, this is uncharted territory. When we played in the bubble, it was something nobody had ever seen. Everyone worked as hard as they could to make that work. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with all these protocols, the different tests and stuff, never seen it before. I\u2019ll have more answers for you [day by] day.\u201d The eight teams that weren\u2019t invited into the Orlando bubble restart for seeding games in July, the so-called \u201cDelete Eight,\u201d are on the other end of Malone\u2019s calendar. For them, this has been the longest layoff since the 1998 labor lockout. New Bulls boss Arturas Karnisovas, eager to get to work since being hired by Chicago last spring, said: \u201cWe must acknowledge they have not had NBA competition for close to nine months. The shortened preseason must be factored in, as they throttle up to NBA pace and demand.\u201d The Bulls and the other seven were permitted in autumn to hold team workouts for a couple of weeks in their \u201cpractice bubbles.\u201d But that was camp, not competition. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell you positives,\u201d said Cleveland\u2019s J.B. Bickerstaff, \u201cto be honest with you, besides the fact that maybe we\u2019re fresh and well-rested. And maybe we\u2019re hungry because we haven\u2019t played in such a long period of time.\u201d Bickerstaff is starting his first full season running the Cavs. He got 11 games in, taking over for fired John Beilein, before the league shut down on March 11. \u201cThe drawbacks are what they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe missed that level of competition in the bubble. There are other teams that got to experience something we didn\u2019t get to experience. There are young players who got valuable minutes in that bubble that our guys didn\u2019t get. \u201cYou look at some of the leaps that some teams made \u2013 Phoenix, San Antonio, Memphis. They got a lot of valuable experience that we weren\u2019t afforded because we weren\u2019t in the bubble.\u201d Bickerstaff spoke to reporters on what got transformed from Media Day in a normal year to Media Week . Everything has been presented remotely, replacing the station-by-station mingling for interviews, photo shoots, goofy antics staged for scoreboard videos and more that typically goes on in a crowded practice gym. And that old joke about overhauled teams needing to pass out name tags never has been more in play. \u201cTaking a job during this year of COVID is brutal,\u201d said Doc Rivers, who went from fired Clippers coach to hired Sixers coach in about a week. \u201cAnd then making the changes. We haven\u2019t had a chance to be in a gym with our guys. We can\u2019t even put in our stuff. Nothing. And then you have like a week and a half, and then you\u2019re in action.\u201d Rivers\u2019 plan for this start-up: keep it simple, staff. \u201cWe\u2019re going to simplify things as much as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt clearly wouldn\u2019t be what I would do if it was normal circumstances. But it is what it is. Teams like Boston and Milwaukee and Miami already have said they had an advantage [with continuity]. We\u2019re fine with that, we just have to make up the deficit and we probably have to do it through work.\u201d Said Bickerstaff: \u201cIt\u2019s the preparation leading up to today \u2013 it\u2019s been so different. We normally try to get our guys into town a month prior to training camp. We start our conditioning program, our weightlifting program. Now we\u2019re kind of thrust into things more quickly.\u201d In this most unusual season, training camps began limited to individual workouts. Group workouts are beginning today in some markets, depending on quarantine timelines. Preseason games will be staged between Dec. 11 and Dec. 19, with each team playing as few as two or a maximum of four. So this steep ramp and hurried pace to Opening Night on Dec. 22 will be pushing players and coaches mentally as well as physically. As Stevens said about Celtics point guard Kemba Walker\u2019s aching left knee , \u201cI think this has as much to do with the turnaround as anything.\u201d \u201cIf we were starting games in the middle of January,\u201d Stevens said, \u201che\u2019d probably be starting right along with us and I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019d be talking about it. \u2026 The expedited timeline of starting Dec. 1 impacted him quite a bit.\u201d This is more hectic than the bubble restart, which at least prepared participants for some protocols. \u201cOur guys have great experience coming through, getting tested every day, knowing all the protocols, knowing to always be on the alert to hit curveballs,\u201d Stevens said. That\u2019s great for battling infectious disease, less so for chasing a high playoff seed. \u201cIf it was a normal training camp, you would already have your checklist and some of them would be checked,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cLike, normal training camp, I\u2019d come in on Day 1 and know who\u2019s in shape and who\u2019s not. COVID training camp, you really don\u2019t know. Right now, all we can do is 1-on-1 stuff. That\u2019s not real basketball conditioning. Someone can look like they\u2019re in shape and not be. The first thing is, what\u2019s our conditioning level at?\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThe reason that\u2019s important is because of injury. You don\u2019t want to be working on something that the guys, literally, physically, can\u2019t maintain.\u201d Don\u2019t forget chemistry, of the sort the immunologists largely ignore. Insta-camps and insta-seasons can\u2019t necessarily fast-track what comes best from slow home cooking. The Milwaukee Bucks thrived on their togetherness last season, posting the NBA\u2019s best record (56-17) and managing not to fray when they got bumped out of the playoffs by Miami. Coach Mike Budenholzer has used a variety of team functions in his two Milwaukee seasons, from dinners out to whiffle ball games. \u201cIt will probably test our creativity to figure out ways where we can create those opportunities,\u201d Budenholzer said, \u201cwhere they get to know each other better, they learn with each other, they appreciate each other, they laugh with each other. And still follow league protocols and everything to stay safe and healthy. \u201cI do think, on the flip side, there will be more time together. There\u2019s opportunities on the road where we stay closer, we stay tighter on a regular basis. \u2026 We\u2019ll find ways.\u201d Said Bucks All-Star wing Khris Middleton: \u201cThat\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve been trying to brainstorm, with the restrictions and staying safe. Last year we used to go out and eat all the time at restaurants and go to movies. This year, I don\u2019t think we can do any of that stuff.\u201d The season will begin with only three shopping days left before Christmas. Scaling down to 72 games means less in-conference competition. The schedule also might feel a little like baseball, with two consecutive games against the same opponent in the same building. There will be off nights in cities between games, like in the postseason, only with newly limited options for where to eat or what to do. Remember, this all will be played out against a regimen of virus protocols that are top priority for the NBA. What worked so well in the bubble is over, as evidenced by NBA\u2019s zero positive tests that were the envy of the sports world. In testing last week as players reported to their home markets, 48 tested positive out of the 546 sampled. So yeah, they\u2019re not in Orlando anymore. With an asterisk for the Toronto Raptors. \u201cThey The North\u201d are down in Gulf-coast Florida. Blocked from operating in their home market by Canada-U.S. quarantine restrictions for parties crossing the border, the Raptors will be based in Tampa for their home games and practices. At least for the foreseeable future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unsettling feelings about having to leave,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to pick up and leave [home] behind. It feels strange.\u201d That included a temperature of 39 degrees \u2013 Fahrenheit \u2013 in Tampa Wednesday. \u201cI know I\u2019d rather be in Toronto but I\u2019m not. Now I\u2019m going to make the best of it here and I\u2019m not going to make any excuses and I\u2019m going to get to work and we\u2019re going to expect to play at a super-high level.\u201d This is a coach who, when working in England early in his traveled career, coped with a team in Darby that could only afford to book a practice hall two nights a week. And then had to wait for a badminton league to exit the court, his players moving the nets to the side. That\u2019s not far from the level of improvising and overcoming NBA players will be asked to do this season. \u201cThe conversations that we\u2019ve had with our guys and our staff is, we have to be extremely disciplined but we have to be extremely flexible at the same time,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow will look like. We don\u2019t know what two weeks from now will look like. We have to do our part to protect one another and we have to do our part to protect something that\u2019s bigger than ourselves \u2013 and that\u2019s this team, this organization and this league.\u201d Said Rivers, who has been part of the NBA as a player, coach or broadcaster since 1983: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned if we can pull this off. Just watching football \u2013 college, Ohio State missing games. Pittsburgh and Baltimore, they can\u2019t even get to a game [the Ravens-Steelers NFL game was delayed six days from Thanksgiving to Wednesday by positive tests]. The difference in football is, they play once a week and they have 1,000 players. So if you miss three or four players, you can still get away with it. If we miss three or four players, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Losing a couple of stars to positive tests and the time required for either quarantine or two straight negative tests could impact playoff chances, Rivers said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cOur guys\u2019 health is a concern. As a coach, you want to go [into a season] with your concerns being more basketball. I think every coach\u2019s concerns right now are probably non-basketball.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Maybe he\u2019ll get a shot as a general manager. Not that he\u2019s ready to get started on those career goals just yet. After capturing his second NBA championship ring with the Lakers, the 34-year-old Rondo has moved on to the youthful Atlanta Hawks, where he will serve as a mentor to budding superstar Trae Young while providing valuable minutes off the bench for one of the league\u2019s more intriguing teams. For the first time in his long career, Rondo is the oldest guy on the team. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird to look at the roster and I\u2019m the oldest date on the sheet,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cBut it\u2019s a natural fit as far as mentoring these young guys. So many great veterans helped me become the player I am today. It\u2019s only right to give it back full circle.\u201d Rondo has also been taking steps to get prepared for his post-playing life. He\u2019s constantly mentioned as a coach in the making. He also has his sights on running a team of his own as a GM. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been doing that for the last five or six years of my career,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cI take a lot of pride in learning from as many great minds as possible.\u201d Last year, when Rondo was back in Los Angeles recuperating from a broken thumb, Lakers coach Frank Vogel allowed him to sit in \u2014 via Zoom \u2014 on staff meetings at the Disney World bubble. \u201cI would wake up at 4 a.m. L.A. time to watch them going over the game plan,\u201d Rondo recalled. He\u2019s also been studying some of the league\u2019s top GMs, viewing that as another possible career path. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in a box,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cI would love to manage a team. I\u2019ve been working to understand young talent, understand the (collective bargaining agreement). You definitely have to understand the CBA to a T. I\u2019ve been doing my due diligence.\u201d Then, he seems to catch himself. Rondo is not done as a player, which he proved last year with a dynamic playoff performance that helped the Lakers capture their 17th \u2014 and most unusual \u2014 NBA title. \u201cI continue to work on my game,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cI want to make an impact when I\u2019m in the game. That\u2019s still my first job, and remains my first job.\u201d He knows his days as a lead guard are behind him. He seems fully content with the idea that the Hawks signed him to a two-year, $15 million deal mainly so he can pass on all he knows to Young and the rest of the team\u2019s promising young core \u2014 John Collins, De\u2019Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Kevin Huerter. \u201cI\u2019m not coming here to be the starter. I\u2019m not coming here to play 30 minutes a night,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cThe biggest role for me is to lead. I want to help these young guys as much as possible to learn what it takes to play at a high level on a consistent basis.\u201d Young is an eager student. \u201cHe\u2019s such a cerebral point guard and for me, just studying point guards growing up, I know a lot about his history and how successful he\u2019s been in this league,\u201d Young said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s all about picking his brain and trying to learn as much as I can from him.\u201d Skeptics have wondered how Rondo will make the adjustment going from a high-profile team that just won the NBA title to a backwater franchise that underwent a complete rebuild since its last playoff appearance in 2017. After all, he has long been known as someone who lets his effort wane during the dog days of the regular season, but will elevate his performance when the stakes are much higher. He\u2019s even been tagged with an alter ego, \u201cPlayoff Rondo,\u201d which was certainly evident this past season when he followed up a lackluster regular season by playing huge minutes in the Lakers\u2019 postseason run to the title. It was only natural to ask Rondo why he thinks he\u2019ll be a good fit in Atlanta. He quickly fired back, pointing out that the Lakers endured six playoff-less seasons before returning to the NBA pinnacle in 2020. Rondo sees the same sort of potential in the Hawks, who followed up three years of rebuilding by making a big splash in free agency with the signings of Bogdan Bogdanovic and Danilo Gallinari. He thinks there is the potential to make a big move in the Eastern Conference, saying it doesn\u2019t come close to the sort of competition the Lakers faced out West. \u201cThis might be a better option,\u201d Rondo said of the Hawks. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs as far as who prevails at the top of the East. Anything can happen in the playoffs. This is a young team with so much upside and versatility. \u2026 We\u2019re on the upswing for great things here in the city of Atlanta.\u201d His future career can wait."},{"id":433432,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mavericks-porzingis-upbeat-while-dealing-with-another-knee-issue","date":"2020-12-04","title":"Mavericks' Porzingis upbeat while dealing with another knee issue","content":"As much as Kristaps Porzingis wants to join the Dallas Mavericks for a pair of games in the national spotlight to start the season, Luka Doncic\u2019s European sidekick apparently will have to wait until the new year coming off knee surgery. Porzingis didn\u2019t have the procedure to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee until October, more than a month after Dallas\u2019 first playoff appearance in four years ended in the first round inside the NBA bubble in Florida. The wait was a medical thing, with doctors not certain surgery would be necessary for the 7-foot-3 Latvian who missed 20 months after tearing the ACL in his left knee in what ended up being his final game for the New York Knicks in early 2018. The delayed surgery and the NBA\u2019s decision to start in late December apparently will sideline Porzingis the opener Dec. 23 at Phoenix, and for the marquee game on Christmas Day at the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. Coach Rick Carlisle said the 2018 All-Star\u2019s season debut will be in January. \u201cI\u2019m trying to recover that time so I can start the season as early as I can,\u201d Porzingis said Thursday, two days after the starting of training camp. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on each day, making progress, getting the knee better, healthier, the leg stronger.\u201d Porzingis injured the right knee in his first career playoff game but played in the next two before tightness led the medical staff to keep him out of the remaining three games of a six-game loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. For a player who sat out the entire 2018-19 season while being traded to Dallas by the Knicks in a blockbuster deal before the deadline that season, missing playoff games wasn\u2019t easy. The recovery, however, has been a \u201cpiece of cake\u201d compared to the ACL rehab of 2018-19, which included the Mavericks deciding not to play Porzingis the final two-plus months when he could have been cleared medically to return. Dallas was out of playoff contention by the time Porzingis arrived in a trade. \u201cI always say the ACL rehab felt like walking in the desert and you don\u2019t see no end,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cThis one is just progress daily, weekly, and I can see by each day that I\u2019m getting closer to being back on the court.\u201d Carlisle said the on-court work is light at the moment, while adding that the medical staff is having to hold an eager Porzingis back. \u201cHis rehab has gone without issue. He\u2019s on schedule,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWhen we get to January, we can give you a better update on where things are.\u201d Porzingis saw head athletic trainer Casey Smith wander by during his first virtual meeting with reporters of training camp, just as he was asked if it was easy to be patient this time after the ordeal with his left knee, or if he was nagging the medical staff just the same. \u201cActually Casey just walked by. I\u2019ll have a talk with him later,\u201d Porzingis said with a mischievous grin. \u201cObviously, knowing that I\u2019m really close or I\u2019m getting pretty close calms you down a little bit. \u201cBut also, in the ACL, you have to be smart. You know if you\u2019re not ready, then it\u2019s not smart to go out there and try to play when you\u2019re not ready. It\u2019s going to be the same case here.\u201d Porzingis finished his first playoff experience with 34 points and 13 rebounds in a 130-122 loss to the Clippers, then watched Doncic\u2019s stunning 3-pointer at the buzzer to win Game 4, followed by a 43-point loss and another 14-point defeat that eliminated Dallas. Now that Porzingis has had surgery on both knees, and missed more time with another knee issue in his first season with the Mavericks, he isn\u2019t dwelling on whether he might be injury-prone. Porzingis leans on his belief that the two more serious injuries involved contact plays. \u201cAfter the ACL, I had no doubt in my mind that I was ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a matter of finding a rhythm, finding all the little movements, the little details. Now the same thing. I\u2019m already on the court putting in work, moving around, seeing how I feel. And that\u2019s it. Once I\u2019m healthy, once I\u2019m on the court, there\u2019s zero doubt in my mind and I just go 100% every time.\u201d"},{"id":433125,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-adjust-to-revamped-roster-as-cousins-wall-reunite","date":"2020-12-04","title":"Rockets adjust to revamped roster as Cousins, Wall reunite","content":"New Houston Rockets coach Stephen Silas revealed Thursday he hasn\u2019t yet spoken with superstar guard James Harden in the wake of the club agreeing to trade Russell Westbrook to the Washington Wizards for John Wall and a reported lottery-protected 2023 first-round draft pick. Silas maintains that he prefers to give Harden \u201csome space,\u201d but expressed confidence his former MVP guard will be \u201call-in\u201d when the Rockets finally come together Sunday to tip off full team workouts at training camp. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him since the trade,\u201d Silas said Thursday on a Zoom call. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, in situations like this when stuff like this kind of happens where there\u2019s a little indecision and stuff going on, I kind of take a step back and allow guys some space. \u201cSo, from my perspective, my communication has been, \u2018I\u2019m giving you space,\u2019 and that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s been as far as my communication with him. \u201cGuys like that need that. They need to figure it out and they don\u2019t need someone banging on them all the time to kind of figure it out where they\u2019re at and whatnot. As far as the organization, I\u2019m not sure. I can only speak for myself. But I\u2019m looking forward to him coming, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what the team looks like with everybody on the floor. I\u2019m confident that he\u2019ll be all-in, that\u2019s where I\u2019m leaving it. As I said, I\u2019m giving him the space to do his thing. But I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll be here when we get started.\u201d Harden reportedly expressed a desire last month to be traded, but according to multiple reports, the Rockets have indicated no plans at the moment to fulfill that request and expect the 2018 MVP to be on the roster for the start of the regular season. In addition to the trade for Wall, the organization made other moves to improve the supporting cast around Harden such as the free-agent additions of versatile, athletic big men Christian Wood and DeMarcus Cousins, while providing more optionality in terms of playing style for a Houston team that last season committed exclusively to playing small ball. \u201cI wanted to have multiple ways to play, and those guys allow me to do so,\u201d Silas said. \u201cTo have John Wall pushing the ball up the floor and either passing ahead to a running wing or keeping it and getting the ball into the paint and making all of the great passes that he\u2019s made over his career, that is accentuated by playing the way that I want to play: five-out with space and allowing guys to get into the paint and do their thing. \u201cTo have Christian Wood trail the play and be able to roll and pop and play in a very similar way that I had [Kristaps] Porzingis playing when I was offensive coordinator in Dallas, I see that as a positive in another kind of way and option for us to play. Then to have [Cousins] out there, we\u2019re not necessarily gonna be in small ball quite as much. We can play big ball, and he can be out there showing all the gifts that he has. He looks really good on the basketball floor doing his individual workouts right now, and he\u2019s working hard to get back. So, the optionality that I talked about in the initial press conference is accentuated by having those three new guys to join the team.\u201d Cousins hasn\u2019t played since the 2018-19 season with the Golden State Warriors, when he averaged 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in 30 regular-season outings as he returned from a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon suffered the previous season as a member of the New Orleans Pelicans. Even Cousins\u2019 time with the Warriors was cut short, as the 6-foot-10 center suffered a torn left quadriceps in the opening round of the 2019 playoffs that kept him off the floor until the NBA Finals. Cousins signed with the Los Angeles Lakers the next season, but before that campaign even started, he suffered a torn ACL during preseason workouts that kept him off the floor the entire season. Now a Houston Rocket, Cousins joins former Kentucky teammate Wall, who hasn\u2019t played since Dec. 26, 2018 and has missed the last two seasons with Achilles\u2019 tendon and knee injuries. \u201cI feel like I went through a situation that a lot of people would\u2019ve [given] up or quit. I just took it as, \u2018This is my life lesson,\u2019\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just preparing me for whatever\u2019s next. Life is full of adversity, and every battle that you go through prepares you for the next one. That\u2019s how I approached it. Also, I want to inspire the next. I\u2019m not the only person that\u2019s going through hard times or have gone through hard times. I\u2019m not saying I went through the worst situation. When those times come, just fight through, roll with the punches.\u201d Cousins described his pending reunion with former Kentucky teammate Wall as \u201can incredible feeling.\u201d Cousins and Wall have known one since they were 14, and the five-time NBA All-Star guard even served as a groomsman last August at the big man\u2019s wedding. \u201cThis is something that me and him have planned and dreamed about for a long time. So, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s just as grateful for this moment as I am,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe\u2019re super excited. There\u2019s obviously a chemistry between me and him from our college days. That\u2019s a guy I consider one of my better friends in the NBA. That\u2019s a brother for life. I\u2019m extremely excited to be on the floor with him.\u201d Cousins called Wall \u201can incredible talent,\u201d adding that \u201cI think the combination of him and James, that\u2019s tough for any team to match up with; pushing at the pace that they play with, the force that they play with, their playmaking abilities. They\u2019re gonna make the game easier for everybody around them, and our job is come out there and make the game easier for them.\u201d Cousins believes the current incarnation of the Houston Rockets represents the most well-rounded collection of talent since Harden joined the Rockets in 2012. \u201cI think we have all the pieces to make a lot of noise this season,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cObviously on paper it looks great, but we have to come out there and put it all together. Obviously, James and John with their playmaking ability, C-Wood with his different intangibles and his versatility on both ends of the floor, myself with the same things, P.J. [Tucker] being one of the best defensive guys in the league, Eric [Gordon] shooting the crap out the ball; same thing goes with the other guys on the roster.\u201d Having spent time with the Lakers and the Warriors for the past two seasons, Cousins pointed out he\u2019s \u201clearned from some of the best in the game,\u201d and wants to bring \u201ca winning mindset, winning culture, [and] a team-first attitude,\u201d into the Rockets locker room. As for Wall, Silas said he\u2019s still taking in information from Houston\u2019s medical staff to determine how to proceed with putting the new guard on the floor as training camp approaches. Silas mentioned that in his offense, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to have a prototypical point guard, you just have to have playmakers.\u201d Obviously, both Harden and Wall fit that description. Silas said he doesn\u2019t plan to make drastic changes to the offense and expects Harden will likely handle the ball the majority of the time. Still, the addition of Wall provides options. Silas \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to see how it all takes shape now that Houston\u2019s roster is finally set. \u201cReally, with his size, speed, passing ability and ability to get to the rim, there\u2019s just so many things you can do, especially now that the game has changed,\u201d Silas explained. \u201cThe game has changed so much in a good way for him because we\u2019re playing with so much space. I\u2019d say there was a lot of uncertainty prior to the roster being set. Now that the roster is set, I think there\u2019s more excitement than anything else. \u201cEverybody is excited about the possibilities that we have; us having multiple ways to play on both ends of the floor and having the talent of DeMarcus Cousins, John Wall and Christian Wood to meld with the previous guys that were on the team. Now that the roster is set and we\u2019re moving towards the first day of training camp, it seems like everybody\u2019s in a positive place.\u201d * * * Michael C.

One day after LeBron James agreed to a two-year, $85 million contract extension with the Lakers through 2022-23, Davis committed to the Lakers through the 2024-25 season. Agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, who represents both Davis and James, confirmed the terms of both deals to The Associated Press. General manager Rob Pelinka announced both of his All-NBA first-team superstars had agreed to new contracts Thursday night without disclosing their terms. James and Davis won an NBA championship in the first season of their partnership, and Los Angeles is back to work in training camp this week with a solid chance to repeat. \u201cIn the Orlando bubble, Anthony Davis proved he is one of the game\u2019s most complete and dominant two-way players,\u201d Pelinka said in a statement. \u201cNow, Lakers fans get to watch AD continue to grow and lead our franchise for years to come.\u201d Pelinka also called James \u201ca transcendent basketball player and human being. LeBron put his trust in the Lakers in 2018, and now this contract extension paves the way for LeBron to further solidify his legacy as an all-time Lakers great. We could not be more honored by this commitment.\u201d Davis\u2019 deal includes an early termination clause prior to the fifth year, but the lengthy contract is still a clear declaration that the 27-year-old Davis sees his long-term future with the 17-time NBA champions. The Lakers acquired Davis in a trade less than 18 months ago, shipping most of their young core to New Orleans to acquire one of the best big men of his generation. Davis made the All-NBA first team three times and earned six straight All-Star selections with the Pelicans, but only reached the second round of the playoffs once. With Klutch clients James and Davis at their center, the Lakers immediately built a championship contender around them last season. The 6-foot-10 Davis swiftly clicked alongside James, who molded himself into a point guard and led the NBA in assists to maximize the talent of Davis, who earned his seventh straight All-Star selection and his fourth All-NBA first-team nod. James and Davis reteamed in the bubble in central Florida and led Los Angeles to the title. The Lakers had missed the playoffs for six straight seasons before their dynamic duo transformed the franchise into champions again, beating the Miami Heat in six games in the NBA Finals. While James won his fourth NBA championship, Davis became the eighth player in basketball history to win an NCAA championship, an Olympic gold medal and an NBA ring. \u201cWatching AD and LeBron, everything they did was together,\u201d said Dwight Howard, who won a ring with the Lakers before moving on to Philadelphia as a free agent last month. \u201cThey worked out together, they ate together, they rolled dice together. We called them The Brothers. They were always together, playing video games, doing something. \u201cEven though there was games where LeBron was having triple-doubles, he made sure he fed AD and AD got off,\u201d Howard added. \u201cI just think when you have two guys like that who are willing to do whatever it takes to win, it brings up the morale of the team. They put everything on their shoulders. They knew they had guys around them, but it was, \u2018OK, LeBron. OK, AD. We\u2019ve got to do this. It starts with us. We\u2019ve got to be on the same page at all times.\u2019 They did a really good job with it.\u201d The Lakers are returning with a roster around James and Davis that looks even better than last season\u2019s championship squad. NBA veterans Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell have replaced Howard and JaVale McGee to keep Davis out of the center spot during the regular season, while Wesley Matthews replaced inconsistent Danny Green on the wing and gifted point guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der arrived to take ball-handling pressure off James. Davis was never expected to leave the Lakers after he declined a $28.7 million player option to become a free agent last month, but many league observers thought Davis would go for a shorter contract to maximize his mobility, as is the preference of many modern stars and Klutch clients. Instead, Davis chose the longest possible contract, albeit with an opt-out after four years. If Davis had set up his deal to become a free agent in 2022, he could have re-signed to receive a starting salary worth 35% of the team\u2019s salary cap. In truth, the differences between his current contract and that hypothetical deal are only a few million dollars \u2014 and for Davis, security with a title contender clearly was worth a few million. Davis will make more than $32.7 million this season, more than $35 million next season and nearly $38 million in 2022-23. The fourth year of the contract is worth about $40 million, and the fifth year would be worth more than $43 million. Davis excelled throughout his first season with the Lakers, averaging 26.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.3 blocks per game. Along with hitting 50% of his shots and a career-high 84.6% of his free throws, Davis was a dominant presence in the paint and on the wing throughout the year while the Lakers played the Western Conference\u2019s stingiest defense. Davis finished second to Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo in the NBA\u2019s defensive player of the year voting. Davis was even better in the playoff bubble, averaging 27.7 points 9.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.4 blocks. He hit 57% of his shots and 38% of his 3-pointers, including a remarkable game-winning 3 at the buzzer in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against Denver. Although the Lakers\u2019 massive fan base couldn\u2019t attend their latest championship run, Davis is already cementing a spot among the franchise\u2019s greatest big men, a proud lineage stretching from George Mikan and Wilt Chamberlain through Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Pau Gasol. Davis spent his first seven NBA seasons as the centerpiece of the Pelicans, but he could only lead them to two playoff appearances, and he requested a trade in February 2019. The players traded from Los Angeles to New Orleans for Davis included Brandon Ingram, who got a five-year, $158 million deal from the Pelicans last month, and playmaker Lonzo Ball. * * * AP Sports Writer Dan Gelston in Philadelphia contributed to this report."},{"id":422111,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-paul-millsap-staying-in-denver-on-1-year-deal","date":"2020-12-03","title":"Paul Millsap staying in Denver on 1-year deal","content":"Veteran forward Paul Millsap has officially re-signed with the Denver Nuggets, the team announced on Thursday .

Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, along with Milwaukee Bucks guard Jrue Holiday (who played for the New Orleans Pelicans in 2019-20), Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie and Atlanta Hawks head coach Lloyd Pierce. The finalists were chosen by a committee of PBWA members from nominees submitted by NBA teams. The winner was determined by a vote of the entire PBWA, which is composed of more than 200 writers and editors who cover the NBA regularly for newspapers, magazines and online news outlets. \u201cThe depth and breadth of Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s commitment to making a positive difference is inspiring,\u201d said PBWA President Josh Robbins of The Athletic . \u201cMembers of the Professional Basketball Writers Association salute him and commend his fellow finalists and nominees for their exemplary work.\u201d A four-year NBA veteran, Brogdon is being honored for his commitment to education, gender and health equality as well as his support for criminal justice and voting reform. In July, he launched the Brogdon Family Foundation with a focus on two major initiatives, Hoops4Humanity and the JHA Education Project. Hoops4Humanity, led by Brogdon and several other NBA and WNBA players, seeks to create access to clean water and education for children and families in Africa. It builds on the efforts of Hoops2O, a program founded by Brogdon in 2018 that raised nearly $700,000 in 18 months to build water wells in Tanzania. The JHA Education Project, which celebrates the legacy of Brogdon\u2019s maternal grandfather, former civil rights leader and Paul Quinn College President John Hurst Adams, focuses on literacy, mentoring and infrastructure programs for students in underserved communities. Under Brogdon\u2019s leadership, the JHA Education Project has partnered with Indianapolis Public Schools to provide students with high-impact educational experiences. Brogdon\u2019s emphasis on education also includes his \u201cTuesday Talks\u201d series, where he leads discussions with at-risk Black youths about overcoming challenges and reaching goals. The Brogdon Family Foundation launched soon after Brogdon participated in a peaceful protest in his native Atlanta in May in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death.  In a USA Today op-ed , Brogdon described his experience at the protest and proposed solutions to combat systemic racism and promote social justice. Brogdon, 27, averaged career highs of 16.5 points, 7.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 54 games last season, his first with the Pacers after being acquired in a trade with the Bucks in July 2019. The 6-5 guard spent his first three NBA seasons with Milwaukee, which selected him with the 36 th pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. Brogdon was named the 2016-17 NBA Rookie of the Year, the only player not drafted in the first round to win the award in the common draft era (since 1966). In 2018-19, Brogdon became the eighth qualified player in NBA history to shoot at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line in a season. Below is the complete list of winners of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award.

There was chatter about Victor Oladipo and there were discussions with the Boston Celtics about a sign-and-trade deal for Gordon Hayward. But Oladipo stayed put, Hayward went to Charlotte, and the only free agents in the Pacers\u2019 2019-20 rotation \u2013 Justin Holiday and Jakarr Sampson \u2013 re-signed. So the Pacers are runnin\u2019 it back with a roster that finished fourth in the East and got swept in the first round of the playoffs. In total, players still on the roster accounted for 98% of the Pacers\u2019 2019-20 minutes. That\u2019s the league\u2019s highest rate of returning minutes by a healthy margin. The Pacers do have a new coach in Nate Bjorkgren, who will likely overhaul an offense that ranked last in the percentage of shots that came from 3-point range (31.7%) last season (and in the bottom five in each of Nate McMillan\u2019s four seasons as head coach). And while they\u2019re returning 98% of last season\u2019s minutes, their projected starting lineup \u2013 Malcolm Brogdon, Oladipo, T.J. Warren, Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner \u2013 played just 86 minutes (in six games) together last season. They\u2019ll have a healthier Oladipo and maybe the Warren that we saw in the bubble, shooting 3s more liberally and accurately. They should also get Jeremy Lamb (who tore his ACL in February) back in the first half of the season. So, while there\u2019s no fresh blood in the rotation and it may be difficult for Indy to remain in the top five in the East given the expected improvement from Brooklyn and Philadelphia, there is an opportunity for a fresh start. The same could be said for the Chicago Bulls, who rank second in continuity, with players still on the roster accounting for 89% of last year\u2019s minutes. The Bulls let Kris Dunn (sixth on the team in total minutes last season) walk, but are basically bringing everybody else back from a team that didn\u2019t even qualify for the restart. So the Central Division could offer two great tests of how much value there can be in a coaching change. Billy Donovan arrives in Chicago having taken his team to the playoffs in each of his five years as an NBA head coach, but he doesn\u2019t have the stars that he had in Oklahoma City. This isn\u2019t just a test of what a new coach can do, but also a test of what kind of coach Billy Donovan is. Here\u2019s how all 30 teams rank in regard to the percentage of last year\u2019s minutes that are represented by players still on the roster\u2026 % of 2019-20 regular-season minutes under contract for 2020-21 The Los Angeles Lakers, though they went 16-5 on their way to the championship, are not exactly running it back. LeBron James (with an additional two years added to his contract ) and Anthony Davis (with a new deal ) remain Lakers, and that may be all that matters. But the champs have parted ways with five of the 10 players \u2013 Avery Bradley, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, JaVale McGee and Rajon Rondo \u2013 who played more than 900 minutes for them last season. While the team they beat in The Finals \u2013 the Miami Heat \u2013 ranks fifth in continuity, the Lakers rank 24th. Bradley didn\u2019t play in the restart and the returning Markieff Morris played more playoff minutes ( 385 ) than regular season minutes (199) for the Lakers. So there\u2019s a little more continuity than the percentage of regular season minutes would indicate. Still, it\u2019s rare for a defending champions to return such a low percentage of the previous season\u2019s minutes. The Raptors lost two starters last year (and had already lost a good chunk of their \u201918-19 minutes with the mid-season trade for Marc Gasol) and still had a higher rate (62%). The 2010-11 Mavs, who parted ways with J.J. Barea, Tyson Chandler and DeShawn Stevenson? Even higher than that (66%). In fact, 56% is the lowest rate of returning minutes for a defending champion since \u2026 you guessed it \u2026 the Last Dance. The 1998-99 Bulls began the (shortened) season with only seven returning players, who accounted for just 33% of the team\u2019s regular season minutes in \u201997-98. Again, the Lakers still have James and Davis. And on paper, they made upgrades around their star duo. But the departure of five contributors, along with the short offseason and an abbreviated training camp, could lead to a longer adjustment period than usual for a defending champion. A year ago, the Pacers were near the bottom of the league in continuity, having parted ways with six of their top 10 guys in 2018-19 minutes . They proceeded to lose their first three games of the season (to the Pistons, Cavs and Pistons again), but then won 20 of their next 26 and finished with their best record of the last six seasons, even though Oladipo played just 19 games and shot 39% when he did play. Over the last few years, there has been a correlation between continuity and winning percentage (in the upcoming season), which makes sense. But success probably leads to continuity more than vice versa. But the correlation isn\u2019t that strong. While the Denver Nuggets led the league in continuity last year and finished third in the West, the Miami Heat led the league in 2018 and went on to finish 10th in the East. There\u2019s also not a consistent correlation between continuity and a team getting off to a strong start. Last year, the team that had the best 20-game start vs. how it finished was Minnesota, which ranked 16th in continuity. The year before, it was Memphis, which ranked 29th. \u2022  The trade that sent Russell Westbrook to Washington on Wednesday dropped the Houston Rockets from 17th (68%) to 23rd (57%) in continuity. It didn\u2019t affect the Wizards, because John Wall didn\u2019t play last season. \u2022 Westbrook became the seventh of the 54 players that played at least 2,000 minutes last season to change teams, joining Robert Covington, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, Chris Paul, Ricky Rubio and Hassan Whiteside. \u2022 There\u2019s just a minimal correlation between winning percentage from last season and continuity this year. The bottom five in the latter does include three of the eight teams \u2013 Detroit, Golden State and Minnesota \u2013 that didn\u2019t qualify for the restart, but it also includes the team with the league\u2019s best record. In their effort to retool around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks parted ways with seven of their top 12 guys in regular season minutes . \u2022 Though the Oklahoma City Thunder roster is a major mish-mash and could undergo even more changes between now and the trade deadline, new Detroit Pistons general manager Troy Weaver managed to outdeal Sam Presti to land at the bottom of the continuity rankings. The top five and eight of the top 10 guys in \u201919-20 minutes for the Pistons are all gone (with No. 2 having left at the deadline in February). The Thunder do get additional \u201creset\u201d points for also making a coaching change. \u2022 With the Westbrook-for-Wall deal done, it seems like the major movement is over. But there could be some minor changes in the continuity rankings between now and Dec. 22, with some returning players (J.J. Barea in Dallas and Chris Chiozza in Brooklyn are examples) fighting for roster spots. \u2022 For now, the league average is 67% of last year\u2019s minutes still on the roster. That\u2019s much higher than last year (56%), but lower than 2018 (71%). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.
