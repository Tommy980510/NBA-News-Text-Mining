Celtics (8-4) at 76ers (9-5), 7:00 ET, ESPN \u2022 Boston\u2019s 12th-ranked offense (110.8 pts\/100 poss) will take on Philadelphia\u2019s 3rd-ranked defense (105.7 pts\/100 poss allowed). The Sixers lead the NBA in blocks (7.1 per game), rim protection (56.1% FG allowed) and rank 4th in opponent effective field goal percentage (50.7%). \u2022 Joel Embiid ranks fifth in the league in clutch scoring with 30 points on 9-14 FG (64.3%), 1-3 3P (33.3%) and 11-12 FT (91.7%). The Sixers are unbeaten in four clutch games with Embiid on the court. For Boston, clutch time scoring has been evenly split between Jayson Tatum (22 points on 18 shots) and Jaylen Brown (21 points on 16 shots) as the teammates rank 11th and 12th in the league in clutch scoring. \u2022 Seth Curry is expected to return to the lineup on Wednesday after missing Philadelphia\u2019s last six games. Curry leads the NBA with a 96.9% effective field goal percentage on catch-and-shoots this season, shooting 20-29 on catch-and-shoot 3s. Curry\u2019s eFG% is 14.4 percentage points higher than any of the other 284 players that have attempted at least 10 catch-and-shoots this season. \u2022 The Sixers are 7-1 at home this season, compared to 2-4 on the road. The team averages 16.2 more points per game in Philadelphia than they do away from home. The Sixers had a similar disparity last year before the season shifted to a single location campus \u2014 going 29-2 at home and 10-24 on the road. The Celtics are 4-2 both at home and on the road, but have shot the ball better on the road (55.7 eFG%) than at home (51.8 eFG%). \u2022 Despite Kemba Walker making his season debut, the Celtics saw their five-game win streak snapped in a 30-point loss to New York on Sunday. The Celtics will need to rebound from their worst offensive performance in years as they scored just 75 points and shot 29.8% against the Knicks. The last time the Celtics scored 75 points or fewer came on Feb. 1, 2015 in a loss to Miami; the last time they shot below 30% came on Jan. 5, 2004 in a loss to Detroit. Suns (7-5) at Rockets (4-8), 9:30 ET, ESPN \u2022 After opening the season 5-1, the Suns have gone 2-4 over their last six games. The biggest disparity has come on the defensive end as the Suns held opponents to 98.7 points per game in their first six games, but have allowed 115 points per game over their last six games. \u2022 Victor Oladipo had a strong effort in his Rockets debut, finishing with 32 points, nine assists and five rebounds, but the Rockets fell to Chicago 125-120 for their third straight loss. It was Oladipo\u2019s highest-scoring game in over two years; he last reached the mark on Jan. 4, 2019 while a member of the Indiana Pacers. This was only the second game of his career with at least 32 points and nine assists; the other coming during his sophomore season in Orlando. \u2022 The Suns allow the fewest 3-pointers attempted (29.8 per game) and made (10.9 per game) of any team in the league. After leading the NBA in 3PA per game in each of the past four seasons, the Rockets\u2019 3PA have dropped this year as they rank eighth at 37.8 per game. In their first two games without James Harden , the Rockets have averaged 14.5 3PM and 36.0 3PA. \u2022 Christian Wood is one of four players to average at least 23 points and 10 rebounds this season, joining Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid. Wood leads this group in blocks at 1.7 per game, which also ranks sixth the NBA. \u2022 Devin Booker has struggled with his shot late in close games so far this season. In 30 minutes of clutch play, Booker is shooting 4-23 (17.4%) from the field, 1-10 (10%) from 3-point range and 2-4 (50%) from the free throw line. By comparison, Booker put up 42.0-20.7-91.3 shooting splits in clutch time last season ."},{"id":478017,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/15-takeaways-from-first-month-of-season","date":"2021-01-20","title":"15 takeaways from the first month of the season","content":"There was never any reason to anxiously hold a one-month anniversary in an NBA regular season before, but these aren\u2019t normal times and this isn\u2019t a normal season. The best part about 2020-21 so far is that it\u2019s still a season. A slate of games have been postponed because of health and safety reasons, which is understandable when basketball is played without a protective bubble. The league will go forward with caution and fingers crossed and hope for the best. In the meantime, the basketball itself seems unaffected once the ball goes up. The highlights: Steph Curry\u2019s 62-point game, Bradley Beal\u2019s 60-point game, the Mavericks giving the Clippers an unexpected 51-point beating and a big Brooklyn trade that gives the East a major attraction to compete with the Lakers in the West, just to name a few. Here\u2019s 15 takeaways from the first month, and what we\u2019ve seen, and what probably lies ahead: Christian Wood: Not only did Wood (averaging 23.8 ppg, 10.7 rpg and 1.7 bpg so far) come from almost nowhere, he initially did so in Detroit, which means not many noticed. But he\u2019s clearly the real deal, a tall and athletic player with a shooter\u2019s touch who\u2019s becoming a very good player and taking charge in this new age in Houston without James Harden. When they signed him as a free agent last fall, the Rockets took a chance that Wood\u2019s mini-breakout with the Pistons wasn\u2019t a tease. It appears they received a steal. Raptors retired to Florida: There are few places you\u2019d rather be this time of year than Florida, where the warmth beckons. Unless you\u2019re an NBA team from Toronto and must essentially spend the entire season on the road. Anyway, the Raptors lost eight of their first 10 games and dealt with the problematic Pascal Siakam, who was suspended for one game and erratic in others. This appears to be a former NBA champ in transition, trying to embrace a new personality and wean some young talent, such as Chris Boucher, who\u2019s thriving, and Terence Davis, who\u2019s not. Heat, Pelicans, Nuggets disappoint: The trickiest part about offering any analysis of a season that\u2019s not even one-fourth complete is the very good chance of false impressions. There are countless examples of teams initially showing themselves to be a tease, either good or bad, before their true destination is revealed. That said, the Heat, Pelicans and Nuggets are all hoping for better nights ahead. Of the three, Miami has the best excuse for a losing record as Jimmy Butler has only played half the amount of games for the defending East champs. Meanwhile, inconsistent guard play is dooming the Pelicans while depth is an issue in Denver with Michael Porter Jr. missing 10 games. Zach LaVine slander: There will be none of that here. Quite simply, LaVine could be one of the most unfairly stigmatized players in the league. The former dunk champ is exciting and has stretched his shooting range to make him dangerous with the ball for the Bulls. He\u2019s making half his shots, averaging 27.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 5.3 apg. LeBron still reigns: Here in his 17th season, with all the tread wear associated with deep runs through the post-season, LeBron James still has the look of a Kia MVP candidate who can get a 20-point triple-double at any given night. Certainly, it helps to be teammates with Anthony Davis, who can absorb the burden and make life easier. Yet LeBron continues to defy age and also enhance his game, this time by bringing better and more consistent outside shooting. Gimme the Ball: The Hornets don\u2019t have the smartest Draft history but they apparently got it right with LaMelo Ball, who makes Charlotte games must-see basketball. He has an element you can\u2019t teach \u2014 impeccable floor vision and thread-the-needle passing \u2014 that makes him fun to watch. The Hornets are doing the right thing by managing his minutes and having him come off the bench, although if starter Devonte\u2019 Graham keeps shooting 32% that may change. Beware the Grizzlies: If you\u2019re looking to identify a team that\u2019s better than its record, why not Memphis? Ja Morant missed eight games and Jaren Jackson Jr. has yet to suit up. Once healthy, the Grizzlies should resume the exciting pace they set last summer in the Orlando bubble. Hard to find many teams with more upside right now than Memphis, still looking to hit its stride. Harden in Brooklyn: Guess what? Nobody cares how messy it got when he left Houston anymore. Even Rockets fans will be in a forgiving mood when James Harden gets his jersey retired in Houston one day. All that matters is here and now, and that\u2019s taking place in Brooklyn with the Nets, where Harden is in the right place at this stage of his career. He can share the heavy lifting with Kevin Durant, whom he respects, and these two high-scoring former Kia MVPs will make life hell for the team on the other bench. It could be that the path to the East title runs through the subway. Which brings us to \u2026 Kyrie Irving: He\u2019s all set to return after an absence that stretched a couple of weeks for personal reasons and NBA protocols. There has never been any issue about Kyrie\u2019s ability to ball. His bounce off the dribble, ability to change speeds, attack the rim and take big shots is unimpeachable. Just two reasonable questions going forward, though: Can he mesh with another ball-dominant player, and will he leave the team again for \u201cpersonal reasons?\u201d The Nets need to know they can rely on a star who could be the difference between winning a title and falling just short. Popovich adjusts: One of the more understated events in the NBA is happening in San Antonio, where a coach who turns 72 next week isn\u2019t allowing a few generation gaps to separate himself from his players. Gregg Popovich is getting older, and the new core of the Spurs is as young as ever, and yet the player connection with Pop remains pure. After missing the playoffs for the first time in two decades, the Spurs are among the league\u2019s early surprises. They have a winning record during this transitional phase and leaning on players who hadn\u2019t even picked up a ball yet when Pop was winning championships with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. The game has since changed and Pop chose to adjust right along with it. Jayson and Jaylen: The Celtics had to endure a reality without Gordon Hayward and also missing Kemba Walker, but the first month of the season was saved by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, their devastating pair of swingmen who carried the club. Tatum is arguably playing better than ever (at least in the regular season) and Brown is definitely at his highest level ever. Together they\u2019re averaging 52.7 points, 12.9 rebounds and 7.6 assists and showing great chemistry together. Boston will still need to replace Hayward\u2019s points and presence, and that player \u2014 if he exists \u2014 hasn\u2019t identified himself yet. But Walker\u2019s return will be a boost especially if he\u2019s more like the Charlotte version of himself. At the very least, the Celtics are in the mix once again at the top in the East. Joel Embiid: When you take into account his impact on defense, then it\u2019s likely that we haven\u2019t seen a big man with such two-way punch since Duncan\u2019s prime. Embiid took it upon himself to get into better shape and reduce his tendency to disappear during stretches of games. After the disappointing way last season ended for the Sixers, Embiid said he wanted to be great. Well, from what he\u2019s shown this far this season (25.0 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 2.9 apg, 1.4 spg and 1.5 bpg), he\u2019s taking those steps. Karl-Anthony Towns and the battle with coronavirus: No words, really. Just no words to adequately even imagine what the Wolves center has endured over the past year, with the virus claiming members of his family and then making a connection to him, too . It leaves you with a mixture of sadness and anger. Steph is Steph: After an injury-interrupted season where he played just long enough to drop a sweat, Stephen Curry is not only back on the floor but back to being his old self \u2014 as if there was any doubt. He\u2019s making an honest attempt to lead the NBA in scoring , and perhaps out of necessity, because the Warriors without Klay Thompson need everything Curry can give. There\u2019s still no guarantee of a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive West, though, and that\u2019s the bigger challenge facing Curry. The Lakers: The defending champs are still flexing three months later, with a virtually new supporting cast. They\u2019re leading the West, and that shows the quality of the job that GM Rob Pelinka did this fall, and also how it\u2019s easy for role players to blend around LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Montrezl Harrell and Dennis Schroder have been especially solid and given the Lakers what they lacked last season: A scoring point guard and blue-collar forward. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He was eager to meet his new teammates, join the starting lineup and make his Pacers debut. Then came the shocking news from Indiana\u2019s team doctors: They found a small mass on LeVert\u2019s left kidney. Suddenly everything went on hold and now, as LeVert awaits test results to find out if the growth is cancerous, the 6-foot-6 guard realizes just how fortunate he was to be included in last week\u2019s blockbuster trade. \u201cI hadn\u2019t missed any games this season yet. I was 100% healthy,\u201d he said during a video call Tuesday. \u201cIn a way this trade showed and revealed what was going on in my body. So I\u2019m definitely looking at it from that side and definitely humbled to know that that this trade could have saved me in the long run.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t gone from Brooklyn to Houston in the James Harden deal, then from the Rockets to Indiana in exchange for Victor Oladipo last Wednesday, it\u2019s unclear when \u2014 or if \u2014 the mass would have been detected. LeVert spent his first 4 1\/2 seasons with the Nets after the Pacers selected him in the first round of the 2016 NBA draft. After a solid rookie season, his scoring average increased each of the next three seasons and this season started as his best yet. He was averaging 18.5 points, a career-high 6.0 assists and a career-best 4.3 rebounds prior to the trade. Though teams conduct physicals at the start of each season, LeVert wasn\u2019t sure if the Nets ever scanned his lower back. That changed when he joined the Pacers, who came up with a diagnosis LeVert never expected. \u201cA lot of things creeped through my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what was going on. I didn\u2019t know the next steps, I didn\u2019t know if the trade was going to go through. Obviously, it did and I think that\u2019s a testament to this organization and not only how good of people they are but how much they believe in me. That was huge for me. I just can\u2019t wait to get healthy and get back on the court.\u201d When that will be nobody yet knows. And until LeVert does return, first-year coach Nate Bjorkgren will be dealing with a short-handed roster. LeVert was expected to replace Oladipo in the lineup and help add scoring punch with T.J. Warren out indefinitely after having surgery for a stress fracture in his left foot. While Bjorkgren said he\u2019s hopeful the Pacers\u2019 top scorer from last season returns, he acknowledged the front office continues to work on a rehab plan. Center Myles Turner, the NBA blocks leader, went down last weekend with a fractured right hand . Team officials said surgery won\u2019t be necessary and listed Turner as day to day. It\u2019s possible Turner could play Wednesday night against Dallas with some extra padding protecting the hand. \u201cHe could have very easily sat on this, sat out two or three weeks and no way \u2014 he\u2019s not having any of it,\u201d Bjorkgren said. \u201cHe told me he was practicing today. He\u2019s been saying this for two or three days since that happened. So I appreciate the toughness and the persistence he has.\u201d The good news is guard Jeremy Lamb\u2019s return could give Indiana another scorer. He hasn\u2019t played since tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last February but has been practicing and Bjorkgren said he expects Lamb back \u201cvery soon.\u201d And if LeVert makes it back, well, the Pacers could be near full strength perhaps in time for the playoffs. But, for now, LeVert has pushed those hopes to the side so he can focus on getting healthy enough to make it back onto the court. \u201cTo me, the most important thing is to get my body healthy and make sure I live a long life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not really looking at that (basketball) side of things right now. Obviously, I want to play as soon as possible. I\u2019m a competitor. I love to play the game. But I think health wise, that\u2019s the most important thing. As far as time line, we\u2019ll figure that out in the future, but right now we just don\u2019t have those answers.\u201d"},{"id":478021,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blazers-center-jusuf-nurkic-undergoes-wrist-surgery","date":"2021-01-19","title":"Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic undergoes wrist surgery","content":"PORTLAND, Ore.  \u2013 Portland center Jusuf Nurkic underwent surgery today to repair a fracture in his right wrist, it was announced by Trail Blazers president of basketball operations Neil Olshey.

He has missed the last seven games, five while away from the team and two more while regaining his conditioning after he was eligible to return. Nets coach Steve Nash told reporters he expects Irving will return to the court against the Cavs. Per Nash, Irving returned to the team and practiced on Tuesday. Irving has missed the team\u2019s last seven games due to a combination of personal reasons and health and safety protocols. Resting his head on his arms folded in front of him while he spoke during a Zoom interview, Irving didn\u2019t give a clear reason for his absence, saying he had a lot of family and personal stuff going on. Irving was fined $50,000 for violating the NBA\u2019s health and safety protocols after he was seen in a video posted on social media during his absence at an indoor family party while not wearing a mask. He also lost nearly $900,000 of his $33.5 million salary because two of the games he missed were during a mandated quarantine period. Irving said he was happy to be back with the team, which acquired James Harden during his absence. The Nets have won both games since the trade.

Ball has 40-point upside, and the $5.5K price tag may be the lowest you\u2019ll get him all season. Be sure to check the injury report ahead of tip-off, but if he\u2019s ready to go, fire him up as a value. Jordan Clarkson (UTA) vs. NOP: $6,300 Across his last six games, Clarkson has averaged 20.5 points, 5.2 boards, and 2.2 assists while knocking down four triples per contest. He\u2019s hot right now, and he\u2019s got 40-point upside thanks to his electric scoring ability. PJ Dozier (DEN) vs. OKC: $4,400 Across his last three games, Dozier has averaged better than 25 minutes, and he\u2019s coming off a season-best 30.3 FD points scored Sunday against Utah. Luguentz Dort (OKC) vs. DEN: $5,300 Dort scored a season-best 50.3 FD points in his last game, highlighted by 21 points and a career-high six swipes. I\u2019m not advising you to chase that lofty point total, but Dort was a hot scorer to start the season, and he\u2019s made his bones in the NBA as a quality defender. His ability to produce defensive stats and pop off for some big scoring nights gives him a high ceiling at just $5.3K. Kenrich Williams (OKC) vs. DEN: $3,800 Williams is a risk-reward play tonight, but you\u2019ve got to take some chances to separate yourself from the field on slates with such a small player pool. Across his last two contests, Williams has racked up 56 FD points in just 41 minutes of action. That\u2019s excellent per-minute production, and at just $3.8K, he\u2019s got the kind of upside we\u2019re looking for on slates like these. Isaiah Roby (OKC) vs. DEN: $4,500 Across his last two games (sans Al Horford), Roby has put up 25 points, 13 rebounds, and seven dimes across 49 total minutes on the court. Horford (personal) may not be available tonight, making Roby a quality value play in a plus matchup with Denver. Nikola Jokic (DEN) vs. OKC: $11,500 It seems really strange to see a guy with an $11.5K price tag pegged as a value, but the options at center tonight are paper thin. Rudy Gobert ($8.5K) isn\u2019t a thrilling option and neither is Steven Adams ($5.8K). I\u2019m eating the chalk with Jokic and looking for value at another position.

McCollum was averaging a career-best 26.7 points, as well as five assists, per game when he was injured Saturday during a game against the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel bad. There\u2019s a lot of people going through a lot worse situations than me,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be OK. I\u2019ve been though injuries before, some foot injuries that were more severe that required surgery, some that required not walking for months at a time. So I\u2019ll be able to deal with this accordingly.\u201d McCollum\u2019s injury is the latest to befall the Blazers. Center Jusuf Nurkic fractured his wrist during a game last week against the Indiana Pacers and is out indefinitely. The Blazers announced Tuesday that he had surgery and will be evaluated in six weeks. In his eighth NBA season, McCollum was first thought to have a sprain but the team said additional imaging showed a hairline fracture to the lateral cuneiform. It was unclear when he was injured but it appeared that Atlanta\u2019s Clint Capela stepped on his foot following a layup in the opening quarter. The Blazers went on to win the game 112-106. McCollum has had two previous left foot injuries, but he said this one was completely different in that it\u2019s a different part of his foot and doesn\u2019t require surgery. He said the injury coming in the midst of the best start of his career was \u201cterrible timing.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can really do about it. I work hard and take care of myself. I put a lot of time and effort into my body,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one of those situations where there\u2019s not much I could have done.\u201d Rodney Hood took McCollum\u2019s place in Monday\u2019s game against the San Antonio Spurs, finishing with 21 points in Portland\u2019s 125-104 loss. Blazers coach Terry Stotts said McCollum was playing at an All-Star level. \u201cJust like when I heard Nurk was going to be out for a while, my thoughts always go to the player first in these situations. What they\u2019re going to be going through, how it impacts them and how they come back from it,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cObviously, it affects our team and we have to get back on track and figure out ways to win without him.\u201d Nurkic was averaging 9.8 points and 7.7. assists before he was injured. Enes Kanter has started in his absence. The Blazers are also missing forward Zach Collins, who is expected to be out several months after ankle surgery in December. McCollum said injuries are a part of the business and that it\u2019s important to maintain perspective. \u201cMy aunt has COVID,\u201d he said, \u201cso there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s more important that what we\u2019re going though.\u201d"},{"id":477823,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mlk-day-offers-drama-intrigue-throughout-the-nba","date":"2021-01-19","title":"10 takeaways from a thrilling Martin Luther King Jr. Day spectacle","content":"There was one postponement and one delayed tipoff, but otherwise the NBA schedule stayed full and somewhat fun on the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day extravaganza, highlighted by a potential Eastern Conference finals preview between the Nets and the Bucks. When the day turned into night and the results were finalized, there was a solid debut in Houston, an uplifting Memphis win against the Suns spurred by Ja Morant, a thrilling finish in Brooklyn, where the Nets had one superstar too many for the Bucks, and Golden State\u2019s wild comeback over the defending champs. Here are 10 takeaways from Monday\u2019s games \u2026 Giannis Antetokounmpo: OK, so we get this marquee showdown, Bucks vs. Nets, Eastern Conference\u2019s best record vs. the big threat from Brooklyn, Kia Defensive Player of the Year vs. \u2026 Jeff Green? Yes, that\u2019s who Giannis guarded in this anticipated game. It strikes you as odd, doesn\u2019t it? Shouldn\u2019t Giannis check Kevin Durant, who by the way sank the go-ahead 3 in the final minute with Giannis about 15 feet away? No offense to Khris Middleton, a pretty fair defender himself, but there\u2019s no good reason why Giannis isn\u2019t on KD, period. Giannis can match KD\u2019s length, and is far more athletic than Middleton, and has a deserved reputation for defense. Besides, didn\u2019t the Bucks just give him the biggest contract in NBA history? Shouldn\u2019t he earn that and his reputation for defense by being assigned to one of the game\u2019s all-time scorers? Let\u2019s hope, for Milwaukee\u2019s sake, that coach Mike Budenholzer has a change of heart should these teams meet in the postseason. KD & James Harden: Officially, this is a problem for the rest of the league. They combined for 64 points against a top-shelf defensive team, and took turns throwing daggers at Milwaukee in the closing moments of a tight game. Even better, Joe Harris, as expected, saw a handful of open looks and finished with 20 points. This was the duo\u2019s second game together after combining for 74 against Orlando a few days earlier. Whenever Kyrie Irving returns, and assuming everything\u2019s good in his world when he does, the Nets will put three players on the floor who command double teams. Do the math: Opposing teams will need six defenders total against the Nets Big Three, and last we checked, that\u2019s illegal. Blake Griffin: It\u2019s always tough to watch a former franchise player in rapid decline, and such is happening in Detroit. Monday was more of the same for Griffin, who\u2019s fading on a team that\u2019s 3-10. It was 36 minutes, five points, five rebounds against the Heat for Griffin, who just a few years ago \u2014 and also several knee surgeries ago \u2014 was a premier player in LA with a fresh max contract. Now he\u2019s shooting 38.3% and yielding to Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee. He has a $38 million option for next season, more than anything he\u2019d get on the open market. So most likely he\u2019s in Detroit for another season. Victor Oladipo: Much like Harden, Oladipo wanted to move on from his team. Unlike Harden, Oladipo didn\u2019t put his teammates on blast. Anyway, Oladipo\u2019s debut with the Rockets, Harden\u2019s former team, couldn\u2019t have gone smoother. Well, OK: Houston did lose to the Bulls . But lost in that result was the welcome Oladipo received from his new teammates. They yielded to him at times, allowed him to flourish and take charge with 23 shots. For most players, especially someone who isn\u2019t a superstar, there\u2019s usually a transitional period of getting-to-know-you. In this case, the Rockets allowed Oladipo to lead them, which could be taken as an in-your-face to Harden. Whatever. Oladipo looked frisky and happy to be in Houston, scoring 32 points with nine assists, both season highs, and seems comfortable. He\u2019s in his walk year but maybe this is now home. Rajon Rondo: Can someone remind us again why the Hawks signed Rondo? And even better, why Rondo agreed to sign with the Hawks? His playing time and production are steadily declining. He\u2019s averaging less than 15 minutes a night and, for the fourth straight game, he went scoreless. Additionally, he\u2019s being passed in the rotation by Brandon Goodwin, a two-way contract player last season who (despite shooting 1-for-10 against the Wolves) has sparkled lately as Trae Young\u2019s backup. Rondo would be a better fit on several teams than the one he\u2019s with now and would be the starting point guard for the Clippers. Julius Randle: He\u2019s the solution, but for whom? Easily the most positive sign for the Knicks is the elevated play of Randle, who recorded his 10th double-double of the season in New York\u2019s win against Orlando . Randle is once again a tough matchup when he\u2019s charging the rim with his natural left hand, but the 6-foot-8 forward is also getting brave with his outside shooting and hitting a very respectable 35.5% on 3-pointiers. He\u2019s one reason the Knicks have upgraded from lousy to mediocre this season, and ordinarily Randle at age 26 would be a foundational block for a team in transition. But would he benefit the Knicks more in a trade? Either way, they\u2019re in a good place with Randle. Remember, the Knicks\u2019 top pick, Obi Toppin, plays the same position, and trading Randle for help elsewhere \u2014 maybe point guard where Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina haven\u2019t quite worked out \u2014 might be ideal. Randle leads the Knicks in assists because the offense is running through him, which says more about the point guard situation than Randle. Chris Boucher: It\u2019s not a coincidence how Toronto\u2019s turnaround has coincided with the rise of Boucher. He scored 20-plus points for the fourth straight game , of which the Raptors have won three and lost fourth by one point. Boucher\u2019s development is similar to the one by Paschal Siakam a few years ago; both are long and athletic, but Boucher brings a better shot. Boucher is in the running for Kia Most Improved Player with the Rockets\u2019 Christian Wood. The Spurs: They had four players score 20 or more in the win against the Blazers, and all four are veterans in their walk year \u2014 DeMar DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills and Rudy Gay. Which of course begs the question: Will the Spurs, who almost never make trades, ship one or more of them before the trade deadline? They all have value to various degrees. Of the three, Mills is the only \u201ctrue Spur\u201d and because of that he\u2019s likely to stick around beyond this season. (Mills is also having the best year of his 11-year career, which doesn\u2019t hurt). The Spurs are clearly in a youth movement and ready to turn the page on the next era, which will belong to Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Keldon Johnson. The Spurs are a Draft-and-hold franchise that subscribes to player development. Do they surrender the four veterans now, or wait until this summer? Draymond Green: During a break in the action against the Lakers, he had an animated discussion with rookie James Wiseman, coaching up the young center and telling him what he did wrong. Draymond\u2019s voice does carry weight \u2026 but thus far this season, his own play seems lacking a bit. He\u2019s at near or career lows across the board and hasn\u2019t had the same impact with a non-contender (this season and last) as he did when the Warriors were a dynasty. This feeds the belief that Green was always more of a complimentary player \u2014 albeit a great one \u2014 than a star. MLK Day: Give the Hawks the edge, in terms of presentation, over everyone else. Atlanta always does it up big on this day, from the choir to the court markings and this year, the \u201cMLK\u201d jerseys, marking the first time in history that a team wasn\u2019t represented on the front. Of course, the Hawks should be No. 1 on this day; they\u2019re in the birthplace of Dr. King, who died the same year the Hawks moved to Atlanta from St. Louis. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Cleveland has decided to move on from the troubled and talented player, a person familiar with his standing with the team told The Associated Press on Monday. The Cavs are shopping Porter around to see if they find can a trade partner before they\u2019ll consider releasing the 2019 first-round draft pick, said the person on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Porter has not played this season and only rejoined the team last week after tending to personal issues, which included a legal issue from November. The 20-year-old was in street clothes and on the bench Friday night when the Cavs beat the New York Knicks. But after the game, Porter reportedly became angry when he learned the Cavs had moved his locker for newly acquired forward Taurean Prince, who came over in the four-team trade with the Brooklyn Nets earlier in the week. According to reports, Porter had a heated confrontation with general manager Koby Altman. Following Monday\u2019s practice, during which the Cavs welcomed center Jarrett Allen and Prince on the floor for the first time, coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he was disappointed things didn\u2019t work out with Porter. \u201cWe all want to see Kevin be successful and I still feel that way, so whatever it is that happens in the future for him, I hope nothing but the best for him,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our responsibility as coaches to give everyone our all and try to make the best of every situation and I can say that we did that.\u201d The Cavs have always been intrigued by Porter\u2019s ability, but his problems off the floor slowed his development and made him a distraction. In November, he was involved in a single-car accident, and police found a loaded handgun and marijuana in his car. Porter contended he didn\u2019t know the gun was there. Charges were dismissed. The team worked with Porter in trying to get his life together. He seemed to make progress and returned to the Cavs last week for practice only to have the outburst on Friday the team deemed as a breaking point. Cleveland drafted Porter with the No. 30 overall pick in 2019 knowing he had issues while at Southern California. As a rookie, he averaged 10 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 50 games. The Cavs once viewed him as part of a their young core with Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and others. Now, they\u2019re just hoping Porter can start fresh elsewhere. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep building together,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cAll we want is the best for him moving forward. No matter what that looks like, we want the best for Kevin.\u201d"},{"id":477569,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-porter-jr-expected-to-miss-10th-straight-game","date":"2021-01-19","title":"Michael Porter Jr. expected to miss 10th straight game","content":"DENVER (AP) \u2014 The struggling Denver Nuggets are expected to be without Michael Porter Jr. for a 10th straight game Tuesday night against Oklahoma City because of coronavirus protocols. Coach Michael Malone said after practice Monday that Porter could join the team on their five-game trip that begins Friday in Phoenix. The Nuggets (6-7) can certainly use a lift from Porter. He\u2019s averaging 19.5 points and 6.8 rebounds over four games. \u201cOf course, we miss Michael,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re trying to do here. When we do get him back, he will be a welcomed sight.\u201d Porter\u2019s last game was at Sacramento on Dec. 29, when he had 30 points and 10 rebounds. The 22-year-old Porter was taken by Denver with the 14th pick in 2018. He sat the 2018-19 season because of a back injury. He played a big role in Denver advancing to the Western Conference finals last season inside the NBA bubble. This season, the Nuggets have gotten off to a slow start despite big man Nikola Jokic averaging a triple-double and point guard Jamal Murray turning in big performances even with a sore elbow. Malone said there will be an adjustment when Porter returns, but his presence will help solidify the rotation. \u201cYou always want to be whole as a team,\u201d Malone said. \u201cNot only are you whole, but you have a really talented player who\u2019s a big part of your current team and also your future as an organization. \u201d"},{"id":477468,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-week-4-damian-lillard-kevin-durant","date":"2021-01-18","title":"Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant named NBA Players of the Week","content":"Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant were named the NBA Players of the Week for Week 4.

In the Eastern Conference, the Milwaukee Bucks lead the way at 9-4, having won seven of their last eight. And in the West, the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers are back where they belong at 11-3, having won nine of their last 10. So, with both teams healthy (and with our fingers crossed), it\u2019s a great time for a showdown. The Bucks and Lakers\u2019 first meeting of the season is Thursday in Milwaukee ( 7:30 ET, TNT ). It\u2019s the start of a seven-game trip for the Lakers and the start of a three-game homestand for the Bucks. And maybe it will play a role in the early-season MVP narrative. Before they get to that one, the Lakers and Bucks each have another marquee game on Monday, part of TNT\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day tripleheader .

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (SG \u2013 NOR): 20% rostered Lonzo Ball has missed the last two games due to bilateral knee tendinopathy. There has been no timetable given for his return. In his place, Alexander-Walker has started, with mixed results. He went off in 33 minutes against the Clippers for 37 points and eight rebounds but then came crashing down with 12 points, three rebounds, and two assists in 20 minutes versus the Lakers. Now, keep in mind that the Clippers are very generous to opposing point guards while the Lakers are the top defensive team in the league, and that game was a blowout. If Ball continues to miss time, then Alexander-Walker can be a source of points, 3-pointers and steals with a sprinkle of rebounds. Willie Cauley-Stein (PF\/C \u2013 DAL): 19% rostered With the Mavericks frontcourt ravaged by COVID-19 protocols, Cauley-Stein has started the past five games and been a top 70 player. He\u2019s averaged 26.8 minutes, 8.2 points, 9.4 rebounds, 0.6 steals, and 1.2 blocks while shooting 68% from the field and 78% from the line. The free throw shooting is an outlier, as he\u2019s more of a 60% shooter, but expect excellent field goal percentage, rebounds, and defensive stats for as long as Dwight Powell and Maxi Kleber are out. They should be returning soon, but no date has been announced as of yet. Patrick Williams (SF \u2013 CHI): 22% rostered Williams has started every game this season and delivered top 140 production. Over the past five games, though, he\u2019s been a top 80 player, averaging 30.6 minutes, 12 points, 1.6 3-pointers, 4.4 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.4 blocks. The most encouraging development has been the 36 mpg over the last two games, despite Lauri Markkanen\u2019s return. Williams provides solid defensive numbers, and his offensive game is refined to score from all three levels. He won\u2019t ever win a week for you but provides solid contributions across the board. And he plays a ton of minutes, which is half the battle. Gary Harris (SG\/SF \u2013 DEN): 18% rostered Harris has missed the last two games due to personal reasons but should be good to go for this week. He\u2019s a top 190 player on a per-game basis on the season, but over the past four games, he\u2019s been a top 80 player. The usage is low at 15, but he\u2019s playing over 30 minutes per game, hoisting up nine shots and providing 3-pointers and steals. Patrick Beverley (PG \u2013 LAC): 19% rostered Beverley missed the last game due to a family issue but looks to be good for this week. The minutes have fluctuated all season, as he was playing 22 minutes per game to start, but over the past five games, he\u2019s played over 30 minutes three games, with a high of 36. Beverley won\u2019t provide many points but will contribute 3-pointers and defensive stats while rebounding very well for his position. Delon Wright (SG\/SF \u2013 DET): 35% rostered With Killian Hayes out, Wright has started the last five games and played over 32 minutes in three of them. He\u2019s not a scorer, and the usage rate is in the low-teens, but he rebounds well for a guard and has notched 10 and seven assists the past two games. Wright will also provide some 3-pointers and defensive stats. The shooting efficiency is the major bugaboo, though, as he\u2019s shooting sub-40% on the season and is at 31% over the past six games. Luguentz Dort (SG\/SF \u2013 OKC): 33% rostered Dort exploded for 21 points, eight rebounds, six steals, and one block in 40 minutes last game! That\u2019s obviously a ceiling outcome, but at least he\u2019s shown that it\u2019s within the range of outcomes. He\u2019s averaging 12.8 points, 2.3 three-pointers, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.1 steals on the season. The percentages haven\u2019t been bad at 46% from the field and 78% from the line. With that said, he will go stretches shooting 40% from the field and sub-70% from the line."},{"id":477300,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-monday-jan-18","date":"2021-01-18","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Monday (Jan. 18)","content":"Trey Burke (DAL) at TOR: $4,300 Burke\u2019s production has been less than stellar over the last week, but he\u2019s still averaged 29 minutes per game across his last three. Point guard is top-heavy on tonight\u2019s slate, with few options under $6K to feel confident about. Burke comes with some risk, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap flyer who\u2019s going to play heavy minutes, he\u2019s your man. Coby White (CHI) vs. HOU: $7,500 White\u2019s price tag has risen steadily to $7.5K, but he\u2019s been as good as advertised this season. The second-year guard has posted averages of 16.3 points, 6.1 assists, and 5.3 rebounds. The Bulls get the best available matchup for guards tonight, and with the point guard position so loaded at the top, White is actually one of the better values at his current salary. Victor Oladipo (HOU) at CHI: $7,500 John Wall is out tonight, and with Houston\u2019s roster severely depleted, Oladipo should be thrown into big minutes in his Rockets debut. The matchup with Chicago isn\u2019t one to shy away from, and the guard will likely be asked to handle a heavy offensive load. Donte DiVincenzo (MIL) at BKN: $4,400 DiVincenzo consistently sees minutes in the mid-to-high 20s, and he\u2019s exceeded 30 FD points four times this season. Priced at just $4.4K, I like him as a value play in a game that features the night\u2019s highest over\/under (240). Pascal Siakam (TOR) vs. DAL: $8,200 Following two disappointing efforts against Charlotte over the weekend, Siakam\u2019s price tag has dipped to just $8.2K. That\u2019s a salary to take advantage of, as he averaged nearly 50 FD points per game across four games prior. The matchup with Dallas is friendly, giving \u201cSpicy P\u201d the chance to turn up the heat. Joe Harris (BKN) vs. MIL: $4,500 Harris logged 30 minutes Saturday with James Harden and Kevin Durant on the floor, and the sharpshooting forward should continue to see quality floor time alongside Brooklyn\u2019s new powerhouse stars. At just $4,500, he\u2019s got plenty of upside in a matchup that has a 240 over\/under. With defenses drawn elsewhere, Harris could see some open looks and really break value at his low salary. Kristaps Porzingis (DAL) at TOR: $6,900 Porzingis has seen his minutes and production rise in each of his last two games, and he scored a season-high 35.6 FD points his last time out. Porzingis\u2019 price tag is the lowest it will ever be, and at a sub-$7K salary, there\u2019s plenty of room to blow past value. Lauri Markkanen (CHI) vs. HOU: $6,100 After missing seven games, Markkanen has played at least 32 minutes in two straight, and he dominated in his last one, going 29\/10 while posting 43.5 FD points. Just like Porzingis, Markkanen\u2019s salary is far too low given his upside. He should be one of the top values of tonight\u2019s slate. Wendell Carter (CHI) vs. HOU: $5,900 Carter is another Bull whose salary is exploitable this evening, as he\u2019s registered at least 34 FD points in four of his last five contests. Tonight\u2019s matchup with Houston is among the best for centers, and this salary makes him a juicy addition to daily rosters. DeAndre Jordan (BKN) vs. MIL: $4,500 Jordan comes with some risk now that the usage is dominated by two (or possibly three) superstars. Still, Jordan should see minutes in the 20\u2019s, and he doesn\u2019t need huge playing time to exceed value thanks to his ability to crash the glass and rack up blocks.

The former No. 1 overall pick scored 31 points, which by itself was impressive if not necessarily record-setting. Williamson, however, missed just two shots in the effort, going 13-for-15 from the field while also going 5-for-5 form the free throw line in the 128-123 win. His 86.6% shooting clip alone sets a new Pelicans franchise record for highest field goal percentage by a player scoring at least 30 points. That efficiency, combined with a 100% showing at the free throw line, has not been accomplished by anyone as young as Williamson (20 years, 196 days) in the last 35 years. The 6-foot-7 forward is averaging 22.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 1.1 steals while shooting a blistering 57.5% overall this season. Williamson\u2019s performance spoiled an epic one by Kings guard De\u2019Aaron Fox , who became the first player in the Kings\u2019 Sacramento era to have 40 or more points and 10-plus assists in one game.

The 1972-73 season saw Archibald lead the NBA in both scoring and assists, a year that included a 42-point, 13-assist effort against the Baltimore Bullets. On Sunday, Fox finished with 43 points (on 17-for-27 shooting) 13 assists, four rebounds and four steals in Sacramento\u2019s 128-123 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. In doing so, he became the first Kings player with at least 40 points and 10 assists since Archibald\u2019s 1973 special. Fox wasn\u2019t the only one reaching a milestone in Sunday\u2019s game. Pelicans forward Zion Williamson scored 31 points on a 13-for-15 shooting night, which set the New Orleans franchise mark for highest field goal percentage by a player scoring at least 30 points. Fox, the former fifth overall pick in the 2017 draft, joins Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum and Russell Westbrook as guards to surpass those 40-10 numbers within the last calendar year. \u201cThere\u2019s more, offensively and defensively, that I\u2019m able to do,\u201d Fox said after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cWe lost on a career high (for me) so it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d  Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":477037,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-look-to-future-after-trading-james-harden-to-brooklyn-nets","date":"2021-01-18","title":"Houston Rockets look to future after trading James Harden to Brooklyn Nets","content":"HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 James Harden forced his way out of Houston without bringing the Rockets an NBA title. Now that he\u2019s in Brooklyn, the Rockets hope the huge haul of draft picks they received in the trade will allow them to chase championships in the future. \u201cOur goal remains unchanged,\u201d general manager Rafael Stone said Sunday, addressing the trade for the first time. \u201cI think we\u2019re well-positioned to develop something really special.\u201d Houston dealt Harden to the Nets last week, a day after he said the Rockets weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough,\u201d in a four-team trade that also involved Cleveland and Indiana. The Rockets didn\u2019t receive a franchise cornerstone in the deal but got many draft picks that should position them to build a talented roster. The Rockets received Brooklyn\u2019s unprotected first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026 and the right to swap first-round selections with the Nets in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027. Houston also got Milwaukee\u2019s 2022 first-round pick from Cleveland. Houston acquired three players in the deal, getting Victor Oladipo from the Pacers, Dante Exum from the Cavaliers and Rodions Kurucs from the Nets. \u201cWhat\u2019s super exciting about this deal is it gives us flexibility,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIn the NBA, picks \u2014 especially high picks \u2014 are the best currency. Everybody likes them. Everybody values them. So that was great. Organizationally, it gives us flexibility to do different types of deals as they come up this year, next year or whenever.\u201d While the trade should benefit the Rockets in the long run, it doesn\u2019t leave them in a great position this season. In eight full seasons with Harden, the Rockets never missed the playoffs and reached the Western Conference finals twice. Houston hasn\u2019t won a championship since winning consecutives titles in 1994 and \u201995 with Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon. This season, the Rockets don\u2019t have a realistic chance of contending for a title and it might be a stretch for them to continue their postseason streak. Houston entered Sunday tied with New Orleans for the second-worst record in the West at 4-7. With Harden gone, the Rockets are led by five-time All-Star point guard John Wall, who was acquired from Washington for Russell Westbrook just before the season. Houston also has veterans P.J. Tucker, Eric Gordon and DeMarcus Cousins and the team is excited about the potential of Christian Wood, Jae\u2019Sean Tate and Sterling Brown. \u201cWe have a really interesting crew,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAnd our goal is to compete and really put a fun team on the court that that really gets after it.\u201d First-year coach Stephen Silas has been particularly impressed with Wood\u2019s performance. The 25-year-old center has played for six teams in five seasons but seems to have found his groove with the Rockets. Wood leads the team by averaging a career-high 23.2 points and 10.9 rebounds. He\u2019s also first on the Rockets and fourth in the NBA in blocks per game at 1.9. Harden\u2019s desire to get out of Houston had been a dark cloud hanging over the team. Now that the situation is resolved, the Rockets hope things will improve on and off the court. \u201cI think it just gives us a chance for a real direction \u2026 so we can just move forward with what each player needs to do,\u201d Gordon said. Silas, who was an NBA assistant for two decades before being hired in Houston, has had a turbulent start to his tenure while dealing with the Harden situation and the league\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. He was asked to grade his performance so far. \u201cIf I had to give myself a grade, I would maybe say \u2018incomplete\u2019 just because we haven\u2019t had a complete full roster and practice time and all of the things that you need in order to put your stamp on a team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing the best that I can and I think it has been pretty good.\u201d Oladipo practiced Sunday for the first time since the trade and is expected to make his debut on Monday when the Rockets visit Chicago. In the last year of a four-year, $85 million contract, Oladipo is focused on the present. \u201cMy goal for this season is to win and win and win and win some more,\u201d he said. \u201cExhaust my potential here and go out there and be me \u2026 to the highest level and help this team win.\u201d"},{"id":476895,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mlk-day-nba-preview-2021","date":"2021-01-17","title":"Feast for the eyes: 9 games on tap for MLK Day holiday","content":"The NBA\u2019s second basketball holiday serves up a feast for the eyes Monday with nine games on the menu for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, including five nationally-televised matchups on NBA TV and TNT. You\u2019ll see eight of the last 10 Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award winners featured on Monday\u2019s schedule in Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and LeBron James, as well as a couple of potential future MVPs in Ja Morant, Trae Young and Devin Booker. Eight players that earned All-NBA honors last season are set to take the court on Monday, which also just happens to be a Free NBA League Pass day. So, take advantage. Outside of the five nationally-televised contests, there\u2019s plenty of excitement on tap, such as the surprising young San Antonio Spurs visiting the Portland Trail Blazers ( 2 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass ) , who have won five of their last six games. Here\u2019s a quick look at the national TV menu on MLK Day: A couple of squads in the midst of five-game losing streaks tips off a doubleheader on NBA TV. Orlando sits below .500 for the first time this season and has allowed 120 points or more in four of its last five games. But Nikola Vucevic is on a tear, having racked up 30 points or more in two of his last four games. This matchup represents what could be a difficult stretch for the resurgent Knicks as they start off a stretch of four games in six days. Even though the Knicks rank 29th in points per game (101.0), they\u2019re No. 5 in opponent scoring, limiting teams to 106.4 points per game. Keep an eye on: Check out Julius Randle, who is averaging 23.2 points on 50.2% shooting, 10.5 rebounds and 6.7 assists. Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley is becoming a must-watch player, too. Quickley has poured in 42 points to go with seven assists, seven rebounds and six made 3-pointers over his last two outings. COVID-19 infections swept through the Minnesota roster, keeping the team off the court since Jan. 13, and star center Karl-Anthony Towns recently revealed he tested positive for coronavirus. So, the Timberwolves could be thin for this one. But they face a Hawks squad that has lost two in a row with a record of 1-6 in their last seven outings. Star Hawks guard Trae Young is 4-of-26 from 3-point range in his last five games. So, he\u2019s due for a big night in front of a national audience. Young\u2019s counterpart, D\u2019Angelo Russell, has racked up 25 points or more in his last two appearances. Keep an eye on: Hawks big man Clint Capela is coming off a season-high 25 points on 11-of-16 shooting and is making an impact on both ends of the floor. Capela has logged 11 rebounds or more in nine consecutive games and is averaging 12.9 rebounds, good for No. 3 in the NBA. The first matchup of a tripleheader on TNT features three of the NBA\u2019s most dynamic guards in Chris Paul, Devin Booker and Ja Morant, who returned to the lineup on Saturday after missing eight games due to a sprained ankle. The Suns haven\u2019t played since Jan. 11, but they\u2019re 4-2 on the road this season (with a record of 3-0 when they dish 30 assists or more) facing a Memphis club with a record of 2-5 at home. The Grizzlies are riding their first four-game winning streak since Jan. 24-29 of 2020 and ranked No. 2 in the NBA in points in the paint (54.7 per game). The Grizzlies scored a franchise-record 80 points in the paint on Jan. 13. Keep an eye on: Naturally, you\u2019ll be drawn to Paul, Booker and Morant. But pay attention to Dillon Brooks because Memphis owns a record of 4-0 this season when he scores 20 points or more. He\u2019s fighting through a shooting slump now. But the Grizzlies, which will be wearing their \u201cMemphis Soul\u201d City Edition uniforms in this one, finished with a record of 20-6 last season when Brooks hit the 20-point mark. There\u2019s star power galore in this one. Former Kia MVP winners in Durant and Harden headline a Brooklyn squad coached by a former two-time MVP winner in Steve Nash as it battles reigning two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks. Milwaukee has won four games in a row and seven of its last eight, while the Nets are riding a three-game winning streak. Kyrie Irving\u2019s availability remains uncertain, as Brooklyn continues to ramp up his activity since he hasn\u2019t played since Jan. 5. That\u2019s of little consequence with Harden in the fold, considering he logged a 30-point triple double for the Nets without ever practicing with the team. Keep an eye on: The chemistry between former Oklahoma City teammates Durant and Harden in their Brooklyn reunion. The duo scored or assisted on 107 of the Nets\u2019 122 points in Harden\u2019s debut, as Durant produced his first 30-point game since Nov. 29, 2018. The Nets have knocked down at least 16 3-pointers in three consecutive outings. We haven\u2019t seen Stephen Curry and LeBron James face off against one another since Christmas of 2018, when the latter scored 17 points to go with 13 rebounds and five assists in 21 minutes before leaving a Lakers win over the Warriors in the third quarter due to a groin strain. The matchup seems almost unfair considering where the Lakers and Warriors stand today, but this game features some of the league\u2019s ultimate competitors in Curry, James, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green. The Warriors are coming off their first loss of the season in a game that Curry scored 30 points or more. The Lakers, meanwhile, are on a five-game winning streak and have won four in a row by double-digits. Keep an eye on: The fit of Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre with Curry in the Warriors\u2019 offense. Oubre has connected on 30% or worse in 5 of 12 games this season, while Wiggins has shot worse than 44% in three consecutive outings.

George Hill (OKC) vs. PHI: $4,500 Hill is risky, but he can easily provide 20-25 fantasy points. That\u2019s all you would need from a $4,500 player. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC) vs. PHI: $8,200 SGA has been crushing recently, and we\u2019ll discuss that in the studs section. Buddy Hield (SAC) vs. NOR: $5,100 Hield has the potential to drop 40 anytime he steps on the floor, and it\u2019s crazy that his price is right around $5K. Eric Bledsoe (NOR) at SAC: $4,900 Bledsoe has been a $7,000 player throughout his career, and his early-season struggles could subside here against the worse defense in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard (LAC) vs. IND: $9,400 Kawhi and Harris will find themselves in the studs section. Tobias Harris (PHI) at OKC: $7,500 Kawhi and Harris will find themselves in the studs section. Harrison Barnes (SAC) vs. NOR: $5,800 It makes no sense that Barnes remains below $6,000. He\u2019s scored at least 25 FD points in almost every game this season and is averaging 31.4 fantasy points per game for the year. Zion Williamson (NOR) at SAC: $7,700 This is a perfect spot for Zion. His athleticism and hustle should guarantee him a double-double against the worst defense in the league. Bojan Bogdanovic (UTH) at DEN: $4,300 Bogey has been a $6,000 player throughout his career, and we want to ride him until he gets closer to that number. Isaiah Roby (OKC) vs. PHI: $4,200 With Horford out, Roby should continue to start for the Thunder. That\u2019s led to him scoring at least 23 FD points in back-to-back games.

Given the city\u2019s steep historical significance in civil rights and the iconic figures who led that fight many decades ago, it\u2019s not for the faint of souls. But Lloyd Pierce not only accepted that challenge within the last turbulent year, he quickly became an impactful and commanding presence not only in the community, but within the NBA as well. The voice of the Atlanta Hawks coach became a force for change, railing against police brutality and systemic racism, and he took part in numerous marches \u2014 with mask on, of course. Pierce also went deeper. He became the face of the Hawks during voter registration drives, especially when the team offered the use of State Farm Arena to the city to serve as a voter registration central for the county. At the March On Georgia last summer following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, Pierce was one of the keynote speakers, and received loud applause when he ended by saying: \u201cI was born a Black man. I am going to die a Black man. But I do not want to die because I am a Black man.\u201d Even before those incidents, Pierce partnered with and made a contribution to the Georgia Innocence Project, an independent nonprofit organization that works to correct and prevent wrongful convictions in Georgia. With the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Pierce recently took time to reflect on the last year, in which he learned plenty about himself and Atlanta, and the depth of desire within the NBA players and coaches to bring about positive change within communities of color. Here\u2019s a Q-and-A with the 44-year-old Hawks coach, who spoke eloquently once again with NBA.com on the subjects that have become a passion for him: Q:  In Atlanta, you\u2019ve quickly become known as more than just a coach. How and when did you get your voice, and why did you decide to use it? Pierce: I don\u2019t know if there was a moment. I\u2019ve been influenced by a lot of people and the work they\u2019ve done. When you become a head coach you get a different level of access and people are asking you to speak. It\u2019s not a moment where you show up and you\u2019re working with the Georgia Innocence Project. There are things that lead up to that. I\u2019ve been influenced by friends who specifically expressed and used their voice in different ways. By the time I become a head coach in the city of Atlanta and get to meet John Lewis, the Reverend CT Vivian, ambassador (Andrew) Young and Hank Aaron, I think instantly you realize you\u2019re in a different place in life. For me, I knew in my first year here that I\u2019m in a different place in my life if I have access to Hank Aaron, if I have access to congressman Lewis, and so what can I do in this moment to help others? And that\u2019s really what I\u2019ve been charged with since I\u2019ve been in Atlanta. I imagine being a Black man in a leadership role and with a platform in Atlanta, of all places, comes with a sense of responsibility. Do you agree? Without a doubt. When you\u2019re in Atlanta and you meet those people, it\u2019s different. I grew up studying Dr. King and the Civil Rights moment and hearing about these people, and to actually meet them, to actually know where Auburn Avenue is and the MLK Center and Edgewood \u2026 these are the areas you read about. To be in that city, to know these people, to know what they fought for, to know that that fight is still occurring, you feel the sense of responsibility to stand on their shoulders and continue that work. You don\u2019t anticipate this in 2020, but it\u2019s a moment of truth to those in leadership positions to try to figure out what your sense of purpose is in life. To me in 2020, it was a sense of purpose and a commitment to stand on the shoulders of those greats. You\u2019re from San Jose, where John Carlos and Tommy Smith attended college and of course at the 1968 Olympics delivered one of the most iconic symbols in the fight against oppression. That was before your time, but did that register with you? You know, I have an uncle who has the high jump record at San Jose State, where they went to school. So I\u2019m familiar with the San Jose State track program. I grew up seven minutes from the university, definitely familiar with the two gentlemen and what they did in Mexico City. But Juneteenth for me was my growing up, my understanding Black history. The Juneteenth celebration was in downtown San Jose, we had the freedom train ride from San Jose to San Francisco to celebrate and march in San Francisco. Everybody would hop on the Amtrak and go. After putting in so much work on the front line in Atlanta trying to get people to register to vote, where were you election night, and what was that like for you? I was in L.A. It was a mess for me. You understand the impact of what we tried to do in Atlanta and the Hawks in opening up the arena. You had this emotional and powerful feeling for what you\u2019re doing. The organizers were the true heroes, but we were able to do our part as well. Now election night comes and we\u2019re kind of out of it. I couldn\u2019t remove myself from the TV, thinking that something was going to reveal itself. It was nerve wrecking, it really was. You know it\u2019s going to be a long process. We heard (the final result would take) days, potentially weeks. I\u2019m sitting there on election night thinking I\u2019m going to get an answer that night, knowing good and well that it\u2019s not happening. But that\u2019s when the drama and divide was truly revealed, from election night moving forward. And we\u2019ve still been dealing with it. Because of the turbulent events of the past year, are NBA players finally getting around to being politically savvy? I\u2019ll say it for myself that I\u2019m not politically savvy. I think the activism and the ability to speak out is not about being politically savvy. I think as a Black man I\u2019m frustrated and saddened by what I see for people of color, saddened for what I see when you think of politics and power and how it impacts our country. But I also realize I have a voice, and our players realize they have a voice. So with their voice they want to work with people who want to do right and create change for people like us, people like me, people in impoverished communities who don\u2019t have health care access and don\u2019t have political access. So I don\u2019t know if anyone is politically savvy in the NBA, but I do know that we are extremely passionate, and I am committed to helping the people of Atlanta and helping people who look like me understand that there\u2019s representation at many levels and how do we help them get there. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving me and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our players as well. In the pivotal Georgia primaries, Kelly Loeffler, the conservative Republican who has a stake in the Atlanta Dream, ran for the Senate and the players on the Dream were fiercely united against her. What were your thoughts on her? I never worry about people because there\u2019s always going to be a divide of opinion and beliefs \u2026 I\u2019ve never concerned myself with her and the affiliation with the WNBA or anyone else for that matter. It is their right, their freedom of speech, their ability to be active in the community and what they stand up for. Our WNBA players have been extremely passionate about human rights and civil rights. That\u2019s the focus \u2014 it\u2019s a group of women, a group of players that have been unified for social and racial causes for a long time \u2014 to have that in the form of leadership at any level. I commend our WNBA players. We aren\u2019t just athletes and coaches. The NBA has encouraged players and coaches to express their thoughts on all things political and social, but I wonder: Would an outspoken conservative player be welcome in NBA locker rooms? Maybe. I could use an example, I won\u2019t mention the players\u2019 name but he was extremely outspoken and extremely conservative and I know for sure his opinion has changed a tad bit because he hadn\u2019t fully understood the other side\u2019s point of view. And when that was brought to his attention, he was blown away. For me, I would love to listen to someone who\u2019s outspoken conservative with an open mind, and I would love for them to be able to speak it with an open mind. It\u2019s not my job to convince someone else to change their beliefs and ideas. It\u2019s my job to express to them what I feel is right, it\u2019s about everyone having equal opportunity, and to listen what they have to say with an open mind and an open heart. I can\u2019t say that conservatism is wrong, I can\u2019t say that liberalism is right. I can\u2019t say any of those things. What I hope is, can we connect? Can we have meaningful conversation? Although we may disagree, can we learn more about each other? To me that\u2019s the true blueprint of this country. That fact that there\u2019s so many cultures and backgrounds, we\u2019re all neighbors. Can we coexist with someone who\u2019s from somewhere else? I would hope so, because they live right next door. Let\u2019s learn a little more about each other and try to move forward. I know in sports we don\u2019t all think the same. I\u2019ve got coaches on my staff, we don\u2019t agree on everything but we have to come up with a plan. And you have to go through your conversations to come up with a plan. Your college teammate at Santa Clara was Steve Nash, who was born in South Africa, raised in Canada and then played played among mostly Black players in America. Did you have conversations with Nash in college? I wouldn\u2019t say it was deep, but I always thought we had good conversations. He and I still have conversations about everything. What you mentioned about Steve is the context of it all. He was born in South Africa where his father played soccer and grew up in a country that was still dealing with Apartheid. He moved to Canada and then comes to the United States. Instantly, that\u2019s three different countries where he was raised in and he\u2019s got a wealth of influence. To me, that\u2019s probably why he\u2019s as vocal and passionate about community efforts because he\u2019s experienced so much. And having those meaningful conversations comes from listening and receiving the wealth of knowledge and information from various factors. If you stay in the single and narrow path it\u2019s going to be hard to grow. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in our country because we have limited viewpoints and that\u2019s why we\u2019re as divided as we are. On that note, how important is it to hear the voices of white people and see them active as partners in the struggle for equal rights? A lot of white voices have been awakened. A lot of white voices have acknowledged that it\u2019s not OK to just not be racist, you have to be against racism, you have to stand against racism, and you have to be vocal in your efforts. That\u2019s been transformation for a lot of white people in our country. So it\u2019s important because it\u2019s one of the things we saw in the marches and protests (last year). We saw white people joining people of color against police brutality, against racism, against systemic racism, and it just shows that when unified, the power of the voice grows expeditiously but it\u2019s not going to do so if it\u2019s just Black people marching, or Hispanic marching. Because then it\u2019s just Black Lives Matter and it\u2019s just a Hispanic issue. It affects everyone and we need white voices to march and speak up and demonstrate that it\u2019s a major issue. It\u2019s been good to see. I\u2019ve had more meaningful conversations with my white friends than I\u2019ve ever had. You and Doc Rivers helped mobilize NBA coaches and get their participation, and how satisfying is it to see such unification? I couldn\u2019t be more prouder of our coaches association and the unifying voices we\u2019ve had since the George Floyd incident. It\u2019s the efforts of a lot of people. Doc Rivers has provided great leadership, Rick Carlisle, Quin Snyder, JB Bickerstaff, Dave Fizdale, Stan Van Gundy, it\u2019s been tremendous to see all these guys communicate with each other. We\u2019ve seen Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr speak out (in the past) but I think everyone stepped up this time and tried to do what they could in their cities and what we could as coaches. The focus is on committed and sustainable change. It\u2019s something we could be committed to whether we\u2019re in this seat or not. An NBA champion hasn\u2019t been honored at the White House in the last four years. How welcome will it be to have that happen again, assuming the pandemic allows for it? A: It should be an honor to be a champion, to become a champion, and be celebrated at the highest level in this country which is the president welcoming you into the White House. Because of the divide in politics and the frustration of power, it (hasn\u2019t been) an honor. I would love for the next champion to walk into the White House and be celebrated for the world to see, because it means we\u2019re getting closer to normalcy, getting closer to that partnership of politics and sports and community, because it should be a partnership moving forward. To see that partnership and to know there is not that divide, that would be great to see again one day. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Team officials made the announcement Saturday on Twitter. They say he will undergo more tests and additional details will be released at a later date. \u201cOn behalf of my family and myself, we want to thank the Indiana Pacers for their support and guidance,\u201d LeVert said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful for their extreme thoroughness during the physical process and I am looking forward to joining the team and being part of this great organization as soon as possible.\u201d The 26-year-old LeVert was acquired Wednesday in the deal that sent Harden to the Brooklyn Nets and two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo to Houston. LeVert was expected to replace Oladipo and help replace forward T.J. Warren, who is out indefinitely after having surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left foot. It\u2019s unclear what the Pacers will do without LeVert. \u201cWe acquired Caris because of who he is as a young man first and foremost,\u201d Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said. \u201cHis basketball skill and on court play speaks for itself and we know he has a great career ahead of him. We will support Caris through this time and know that he will join us on the court as soon as he is able.\u201d The Pacers expected to get several advantages from the acquisition. LeVert\u2019s contract is $4.8 million cheaper this season and likely cheaper than it would have been to re-sign Oladipo after this seaosn. Plus, LeVert is signed through 2022-23 as are three other Pacers starters. And while the 28-year-old Oladipo continues his comeback from a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee, LeVert looked like a player on the rise. His scoring totals improved each of his first four seasons in the league and despite largely coming off the bench, this has been his best all-around season. He\u2019s averaging 18.5 points, 6.0 assists and 4.3 rebounds \u2014 the last two last two categories being career bests."},{"id":476426,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/james-harden-available-to-make-nets-debut","date":"2021-01-16","title":"James Harden available to make Nets debut against Magic","content":"James Harden is available to make his Brooklyn Nets debut against the Orlando Magic on Saturday and will be in the starting lineup, according to coach Steve Nash.

Harden\u2019s situation with the Rockets came to a head Tuesday after a blowout loss to the Los Angeles Lakers when he stated the team was not good enough to win a title. By Thursday, he was in Brooklyn.

Here is a closer look at those six MLK Day Classics as well as a few other notable performances and statistics from MLK Day games of the past. Jan. 17, 1994: Ewing\u2019s 34 Points Powers Knicks Past Wolves Box Score:  Knicks 106, Timberwolves 94 The New York Knicks got double-doubles from Patrick Ewing (34 points, 11 rebounds) and John Starks (27 points, 11 assists) as they defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 106-94 at Madison Square Garden. During the game, Ewing became the first Knicks player to reach the 15,000 career points milestone. He remains the franchise leader in scoring at 23,665 points and no other player has scored 15,000 points in a Knicks uniform. Jan. 15, 2007: Agent Zero Scores 51 Points, Hits Game Winner Box Score:  Wizards 114, Jazz 111 Gibert Arenas scored what was then an MLK Day record 51 points, including the game-winning 3-pointer with 0.9 seconds remaining to lead the Washington Wizards to a 114-111 home win over the Utah Jazz. This was the second 50+ point game of the season for Arenas and third of his career as he would finish third in the scoring title race at 28.4 ppg. Arenas shot 14-29 from the field, 7-12 from three and 16-17 from the free throw line to get his 51 points \u2014 an MLK Day record that would hold for nine years. Jan. 18, 2016: Kemba Sets Personal, Franchise, MLK Day Scoring Mark Box Score:  Hornets 124, Jazz, 119 (2OT) Kemba Walker celebrated the MLK holiday by having the best game of his young career. In his fifth season, Walker scored a career-high and franchise-record 52 points to lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 124-119 double overtime win over the Utah Jazz. Walker shot 16-34 from the field, 6-11 from beyond the arc and 14-15 from the free throw line to set the NBA\u2019s new MLK Day scoring record, while also adding nine rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Walker would top this scoring performance two seasons later, but his MLK Day mark stood for four years. Jan. 16, 2017: Splash Brothers Lead Warriors Over Cavaliers Box Score:  Warriors 126, Cavaliers 91 After an epic seven-game series in the 2016 NBA Finals, the Warriors and Cavaliers would meet on each of the NBA\u2019s top holiday showcases \u2014 Christmas Day and MLK Day \u2014 the following season. The defending champion Cavs struck first on Christmas Day as they rallied in the fourth quarter for a one-point win. MLK Day was a different story as the Warriors jumped on the Cavs from the opening tip and never let up. Klay Thompson led all scorers with 26 points, Stephen Curry added 20, Kevin Durant added 21, and Draymond Green earned a triple-double for Golden State. Thompson and Curry each made five 3-pointers, combining to shoot 10-23 from distance \u2014 topping the Cavs entire team as they shot 9-34 from 3. Jan. 15, 2018: Durant Outduels LeBron in MLK Day Showdown Box Score:  Warriors 118, Cavaliers 108 Another year, another star-studded Warriors-Cavaliers matchup on MLK Day. The Cavs entered the game having won 13 straight home games, while the Warriors had won 12 straight road games. The Warriors were the ones that kept their streak alive thanks for a 32-point effort by Kevin Durant en route to a 118-108 win. With the Cavs leading by seven points at the half, Durant erupted for 16 points in the third quarter on 4-7 shooting from the field, 2-3 from deep and 6-6 from the line as the Warriors erased the lead and took control. LeBron James had 32 points for the Cavs, but the team went ice cold in the fourth quarter (6-23 FG, 1-5 3P, 4-9 FT) to seal their fate. Jan. 20, 2020: Lillard Scores Team-Record, MLK Day-Record 61 Points Box Score:  Blazers 129, Warriors 124 (OT) Damian Lillard turned last season\u2019s MLK Day into Dame Time when he scored 61 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 129-124 overtime win over the Golden State Warriors. The 61 points not only marked a career high for Lillard and a franchise record for the Blazers, it also topped Kemba Walker\u2019s mark for the most points ever scored on MLK Day. Lillard became the first (and remains the only) player in NBA history to score at least 60 points and make at least 10 3-pointers in a game \u2014 and the Blazers needed every one of them as they trailed by as many as 12 points in the third quarter before rallying to force OT and secure the win. There have been 20 MLK Day games in which a player scored at least 40 points, including three over 50 points, which are all highlighted above. Here are some of the notable 40+ point games: Blake Griffin (Jan. 17, 2011, Box Score ): The Clippers rookie phenom scored a then career-high 47 points on 19-24 shooting from the field, and grabbed 14 boards, to lead the Clippers to a 114-107 win over the Indiana Pacers. Michael Jordan (Jan. 15 1996, Box Score ): Jordan had the highest-scoring game in MLK Day history for over a decade when he scored 46 points in Chicago\u2019s 116-109 win over Washington. Jordan\u2019s mark held from 1996 until 2007 when Gilbert Arenas scored 51 points. James Harden (Jan. 19, 2015, Box Score ): Harden needed only 18 shot attempts to score 45 points in Houston\u2019s 110-98 win over Indiana. Harden shot 12-18 from the field, 7-12 from three and 14-15 from the free throw line. Of course, it\u2019s not all about scoring on MLK Day; here are few more standout performances from MLK Day history. Mark Jackson (Jan. 20, 1997, Box Score ): Mark Jackson dished out a career-best 22 assists to go with 21 points to lead Denver to a 132-123 win over New Jersey and in doing so tallied the most assists in the history of MLK Day. Dwight Howard (Jan. 18, 2016, Box Score ): Howard holds the record for most rebounds collected on MLK Day with 26 to go with 36 points in Houston\u2019s 140-132 overtime loss to the LA Clippers. Since the 1983-84 season, there have been only three performances where a player tallied at least 36 points and 26 rebounds as Howard joined Chris Webber (2001) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1988). Shaquille O\u2019Neal (Jan. 18, 1993, Box Score ): Shaq and Patrick Ewing (1990) are tied for the most blocks in a game on MLK Day with eight. For Shaq, his eight blocks came as part of a monster game as he added 38 points, 16 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals in Orlando\u2019s 124-118 overtime loss to Philadelphia. The only other player to reach those marks in a game since 1983-84 is Hakeem Olajuwon in 1987."},{"id":476391,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-saturday-jan-16","date":"2021-01-16","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Saturday (Jan. 16)","content":"Goran Dragic (MIA) vs. DET: $5,700 Dragic has been upgraded to questionable after missing each of the last two games due to landing on the COVID list. He should immediately command a large role in the offense should he be able to suit up and is averaging 1.11 FanDuel points per minute while garnering a 30.8% usage rate without Jimmy Butler on the court this season. Shake Milton (PHI) @ MEM: $5,600 Milton picked up right where he left off after missing three games, dropping 31 points and seven dimes en route to 51.9 FanDuel points in Thursday\u2019s win over the Heat. With Joel Embiid sitting this one out due to knee pain, Philly will need to find their offense elsewhere, and Milton fits the bill. In 149 total minutes without Embiid on the court this season, Milton is seeing a 28.5% usage rate and averaging 1.11 FanDuel points per minute. Cam Reddish (ATL) @ POR: $4,500 Reddish has scored 20 or more points in two of his last three games and has been the biggest beneficiary of Bogdan Bogdanovic\u2018s knee injury. Saturday\u2019s matchup against the Blazers\u2019 is the highest projected over\/under on the slate at 236, giving him plenty of opportunities to produce value. Derrick Rose (DET) @ MIA: $5,700 Rose has been removed from the injury report after missing the previous two games with knee soreness. He\u2019s averaged 26.09 FanDuel points per game this season but gets a terrific matchup against the Heat, who have struggled to contain slashing guards and just gave up 31 points to Shake Milton on Thursday. Rose should continue to see a hefty workload in the aftermath of Killian Hayes\u2019 labral hip tear. Precious Achiuwa (MIA) vs. DET: $4,200 Precious went toe-to-toe with Joel Embiid in each of the last two games and managed to post a double-double in both. He\u2019s been getting some extra playing time while multiple Heat players remain inside the league\u2019s health and safety protocols, and that should be the case once again Saturday. Precious is averaging 30.6 FanDuel points over his last two games and gets a matchup with a Pistons team who are surrendering the fourth-most fantasy points per game this season. Caleb Martin (CHA) @ TOR: $3,900 With Gordon Hayward banged up, Martin was inserted into the starting lineup for Thursday\u2019s game against the Raptors. He struggled with his shot but could contribute solid numbers in other areas, leading to a season-high 24.2 FanDuel points. If Hayward is forced to sit once more, most people will run to Miles Bridges at $4,300, but Martin represents a nice contrarian play for Saturday\u2019s slate. Brandon Clarke (MEM) vs. PHI: $5,900 Clarke has been impressive as of late, topping 40+ FanDuel points in two of his last three games. While a matchup against Philly looks tough on paper, Joel Embiid won\u2019t be out there due to knee soreness, which will surely make things easier for Clarke down low. Harry Giles (POR) vs. ATL: $3,800 With Jusuf Nurkic suffering a fractured hand during Thursday\u2019s loss to the Pacers, Giles and Enes Kanter remain as the only true big men left on the Blazers\u2019 roster. Kanter will presumably start at center in Nurkic\u2019s absence, though Giles will certainly see an increased role as we advance. With Saturday\u2019s game against the Hawks leading the slate with the highest over\/under at 236, there should be plenty of fantasy production up for grabs in Portland\u2019s frontcourt. Giles is averaging 1.11 FanDuel points per minute in 69 minutes without Nurkic on the court this season. Enes Kanter (POR) vs. ATL: $5,200 Kanter will presumably slide into the starting lineup on Saturday in the aftermath of Jusuf Nurkic\u2019s fractured hand. He\u2019s seen 223 minutes without Nurkic on the court this season and has managed to produce 1.20 FanDuel points per minute in that span. In addition to his increased role, the Hawks give up the most fantasy points per game to opposing centers this season. Dwight Howard (PHI) @ MEM: $4,400 Howard has been performing well as of late, averaging 21.7 FanDuel points in only 21.4 minutes over his last five games. With Joel Embiid already ruled out due to knee soreness, Howard is in line to slide into the starting lineup on Saturday. He\u2019s played 209 minutes without Embiid on the court and has averaged 1.01 FanDuel points per minute during that span.

Shoot more. Focus on your technique. Take it step by step. Just shoot more. That\u2019s it. The more you shoot, the more you work on it, the better you get. There\u2019s no secret in that.\u201d According to Elias Sports Bureau, Antetokounmpo\u2019s 1-of-10 outing was the worst single-game performance from the foul line in Bucks history for a player with at least 10 attempts. Elias Sports also noted that the only other players to shoot 10% or worse from the free-throw line in a game with at least 10 attempts are Andre Drummond, Al Horford and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Drummond has done it four times and O\u2019Neal did it twice. Antetokounmpo has made just 57.5% of his free throws this season after shooting a career-low 61.8% from the line last season. That\u2019s a precipitous fall for someone who has a career average of above 71% and made 76% of his free throws as recently as 2017-18. He\u2019s continuing to play at an MVP level in every other respect, but the lack of accuracy from the foul line is concerning because he gets there so often. Antetokounmpo is 69 of 120 this season and entered Friday night\u2019s action leading the NBA in free-throw attempts. Bucks forward Khris Middleton noted that many players go through tough stretches from the free-throw line. Middleton noted that Antetokounmpo sometimes makes bunches of free throws in a row during practice. \u201cI don\u2019t say much to him,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in his head and have him think about 1,000 different things. I think he knows what he needs to do.\u201d Antetokounmpo says it\u2019s not a case of thinking too much when he\u2019s at the line. \u201cI don\u2019t think at the free-throw line,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI just shoot shots. I\u2019ve done this since I was like 12 years old. There are players that probably think when they shoot or whatever the case might be. I just go to the free-throw line and say the stuff I say always to myself, try to have a good technique and just try to shoot the ball high and give it a chance because most of my [missed] shots are short.\u201d Video footage of Antetokounmpo working on his free throws after the game circulated on social media late Friday night. That work ethic helps explain why the Bucks remain confident he\u2019ll eventually improve from the line. \u201cHe\u2019s just got to keep working through the free-throw line, continue to put the time in, grow his confidence and step up and make them,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said."},{"id":476196,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/need-for-healthy-bodies-provides-opportunities-for-two-way-players","date":"2021-01-16","title":"Need for healthy bodies provides opportunities for two-way players","content":"There\u2019s no one way to look at the NBA\u2019s use of two-way players. For some, the two-way contracts that allow promising young players to bounce up and down between the NBA and its developmental arm, the G League, are great for exposing them to the game at its highest level. For others, they enable bright talents to still get game experience, to compete and stay in rhythm rather than stagnate at the end of the bench. And now, for an increasing number of NBA front offices, two-way contracts are living, breathing insurance policies against the roster ravages of positive coronavirus tests. In fact, in the wake of 13 postponed games as of Friday due to an increasing number of players rendered unavailable by health and safety protocols, the league reportedly may permit teams to add a third two-way player for the rest of the 2020-21 regular season. Currently, each franchise can employ two two-way players. A third would address the need for a team to have a minimum of eight active players to participate in a game. The league is postponing games with the apparent intent to play them when the second half of 2020-21\u2019s schedule is released. Bumping the rosters to 18 from the current 17 might have saved a few cancellations by this point. It\u2019s hard to think of three inexperienced and unheralded signees as any sort of cavalry. But the way things have gone, every healthy body helps. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you come up with the terminology,\u201d Byron Spruell, the NBA\u2019s President, League Operations, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe two-way system really allows these players to get game action as well as practice time. But now it\u2019s about the flexibility for teams to have access to more players, whether it\u2019s for a practice or a game option.\u201d Toronto forward Yuta Watanabe is on his third go-round as a two-way player, having previously worked under that status for Memphis before signing with the Raptors in November. He saw action in 33 games with the Grizzlies in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and had logged six appearances in Toronto\u2019s first 11 games. \u201cWith the virus, nobody knows who\u2019s going to play in the next game,\u201d Watanabe told NBA.com last week. \u201cSo two-way players have to be ready if you get eight, nine, 10 guys out [for health protocols].\u201d Two-way contracts popped up on the NBA radar in 2017, when rosters were expanded from 15 to 17 to accommodate the status. Essentially, it was the league\u2019s version of major league baseball\u2019s use of farm teams to call up or send down young prospects as needed. This season, in anticipation of pandemic complications and the G League\u2019s own uncertain circumstances, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association made some changes to two-way deals. Usage rules now allow a player to be active for up to 50 of his team\u2019s 72 regular-season games. Previously, a two-way player only could spend 45 days, for games or practices, with the main team. Salaries were changed too, given the expectation that many NBA teams may keep their two-way players on hand all season. They now are paid a flat $450,000 rather than pay determined by their time split between the two leagues. Their salaries do not count against a team\u2019s cap or luxury tax liability. In previous seasons, two-way contracts were a nice orientation program for young players, an opportunity to dip their toes into the big time while still having a regular outlet for heavy minutes and competition more in keeping with their resumes. This time, the NBA\u2019s plan to play outside a bubble portended some virus impact. Add the shortened turnaround time between the end of The Finals in October, the Draft on Nov. 18 and the opening of veteran camps a few days later, and an urgency to fill roster spots \u2013 or grab them, as the case may be \u2013 increased. Both front offices and players\u2019 agents saw the two-way slots as essential. \u201cMore than in years past, a lot of people committed to two-ways on Draft night as just a way to deal with the uncertainty of the rosters,\u201d said Dan Tolzman, Toronto\u2019s assistant GM and VP of player personnel. \u201cEvery year, second-round picks, a handful wind up being two-ways. But this year, there were players picked as high as in the 30\u2019s who ended up on two-way contracts. That\u2019s pretty uncommon. \u201cUsually drafted rookies like that would be the 14 th or 15 th man on the roster. Now if those guys are on a two-way, that opens up a roster spot for a more veteran player. It\u2019s one way to tackle the depth question this season.\u201d Only players with fewer than four years of NBA experience are eligible for two-way deals. So no team can sign and stash Jamal Crawford, Isaiah Thomas or Kyle Korver there as super-reserves. A reported 29 players from the 2020 Draft signed two-way deals, per a league spokesperson. The average age for all two-way players is about 22.5 years old. Many have some NBA experience, mostly meager. The most seasoned in 2020-21 is Frank Jackson, who boasts 120 appearances with New Orleans and added three more for the Pistons heading into the weekend. Absences, whether caused by virus tests or traditional injuries, have meant opportunities for G League players. Miami point guard Gabe Vincent, in his second season, appeared in only three games through Thursday but averaged 17.3 points and 4.3 points, and logged a combined 71 minutes in starting the two most recent. With guard Markelle Fultz\u2019s season ending in Orlando with a torn ACL, two-way guard Jordan Bone was deployed by coach Steve Clifford in six recent games for a total of 93 minutes. Then there is Golden State\u2019s Juan Toscano-Anderson, who started twice for the Warriors in the first week after forward Marquese Chriss suffered a broken right leg. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re \u2018lucky\u2019 this season because that\u2019s ironic to say in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d said Toscano-Anderson, who went undrafted in 2015 after two seasons at Marquette. \u201cBut you have to take advantage of the circumstances that you have. I have no control over the rules or the protocols. But any two-way player should be trying to take advantage of any opportunity.\u201d Toscano-Anderson, 27, averaged 3.2 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes while playing in Golden State\u2019s first six games. He had not appeared since Jan. 3. Such is the understudy existence of a two-way player, more so even than experienced reserves. \u201cIf you\u2019re on an NBA roster, you should be prepared to contribute some way or some how,\u201d said Toscano-Anderson, an Oakland native. \u201cI feel like all two-way players are deserving of that spot. It\u2019s up to you, in sports or in life, to seize the moment and take advantage of the opportunities you\u2019re given.\u201d Toscano-Anderson\u2019s two-way running mate with the Warriors is Nico Mannion, far more raw at age 19. He was the No. 48 pick back in November after one season at Arizona, and the son of former NBA journeyman Pace Mannion, who played 216 games from 1983 to 1989 with six different franchises. Mannion had played only eight minutes through the Warriors\u2019 first dozen games, due primarily to Steph Curry and Brad Wanamaker staying healthy. That sort of situation is extremely knock-on-wood, more so this season than most. \u201cThe biggest thing for me is just learning,\u201d Mannion said. \u201cWith this coronavirus, you never know what\u2019s around the corner. People might get sick. If that happens here, we\u2019ve got Juan and me just in case we need to suit up.\u201d In a normal season, two-way players would yo-yo between their two teams. They\u2019d try to be sponges at the NBA level, learning by practicing and watching. Then they would get their reps and sharpen their rhythm playing big minutes for the G League club. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that split of time would be the best combination for a promising talent such as Mannion. \u201cIt would be great for G Leaguers, guys like our guys and Nico especially, to just play basketball for a month straight,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd then as many practices with us as well.\u201d But until roughly a week ago, it wasn\u2019t clear if or when the G League would even be an option. The latest plan is for 18 teams to play a shortened schedule in isolation at the same Walt Disney World complex where the NBA staged its restart and postseason last summer. Several G League operations, such as Tacko Fall\u2019s Maine Red Claws, have chosen not to participate in the bubble once it begins in February. Eventually, eight G League teams will compete in a single-elimination playoff. Last season, the minor league suspended play on March 12 and never crowned a champion. It still isn\u2019t known what specific protocols and quarantine requirements will be in place in Orlando. That makes sending two-way players potentially tricky, both for a lag in timing and for potential virus spread. Same for injured NBA players who, in years past, might have dropped in to play a G League game or two as their last stage of rehab. Spruell believes the NBA will be able to craft protocols that will enable a \u201cseamless transition\u201d into or out of the \u201cGubble,\u201d as some have dubbed it. Don\u2019t be surprised, though, to see two-way players living a one-way existence this season. If NBA teams are considering adding a third such player to the roster, they can\u2019t be too inclined to farm out someone already on the roster, when a rash of positive tests could hit hard. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much unknown, in terms of what the in and out assignment abilities are,\u201d the Raptors\u2019 Tolzman said. \u201cNormally we line up the two schedules and map out as best we can for maximizing the back and forth. As soon as our game schedules are set for the bubble, we\u2019ll try to do the same thing. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep in mind that, especially this year, something could happen with the main team that we\u2019d need all hands on deck rather quickly.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

James Harden addressed the media Friday for the first time since joining the Brooklyn Nets in Wednesday\u2019s blockbuster trade and countered the narrative he was disrespectful to former teammates, while explaining his rationale for wanting to depart the Houston Rockets. \u201cI wasn\u2019t disrespectful to anyone,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThose guys had just got there to Houston. I\u2019ve been there for a very long time. I\u2019ve been through all the ups and downs with that organization, and I wasn\u2019t disrespectful towards anyone. I just made a comment that the team as a whole wasn\u2019t good enough to compete for a title. And the stage in my career where I am now, that\u2019s what I would love. So, I wasn\u2019t trying to be disrespectful to anybody, especially not to the organization. Like I said, I\u2019m excited to be here in Brooklyn, excited for a new start.\u201d Harden landed with the Nets, after a controversial end to a brilliant nine-year tenure in Houston. Although Harden, reportedly, had been seeking a trade before the season even tipped off, the situation came to a head on Tuesday in the aftermath of Houston\u2019s 117-100 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Harden told the media on a Zoom call after the game that \u201cwe\u2019re just not good enough,\u201d before adding that \u201cI literally have done everything that I can. This situation is crazy. It\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think can be fixed.\u201d Those remarks resulted in scathing commentary from Rockets teammates with DeMarcus Cousins saying, \u201cthe disrespect started way before any interview,\u201d before adding that \u201cit\u2019s completely unfair to the rest of the guys in the locker room.\u201d Houston point guard John Wall initially said \u201cno comment\u201d when asked about Harden\u2019s postgame remarks on Tuesday. \u201cBut when you have certain guys in the mix that don\u2019t want to buy in all in one, it\u2019s gonna be hard to do anything special, to do anything good as a basketball team,\u201d Wall later added. The ensuing firestorm led to Rockets coach Stephen Silas excusing Harden from Wednesday\u2019s practice at the Toyota Center. The coach admitted Wednesday that Harden\u2019s remarks \u201cwere hard to hear, especially when you don\u2019t believe it and know it not to be true.\u201d Harden expressed remorse for the way things played out in his last days in Houston, but explained that he took a hard look at the organization, and \u201cfelt like we didn\u2019t have a chance\u201d after it fell in the playoffs last season to the Lakers in just five games. \u201cYeah, I regret because I\u2019m not the type of guy to\u2026 I don\u2019t need the attention, especially the negative energy, the negative attention. I\u2019ve never been that guy,\u201d Harden said. \u201cSo, there were some things I felt like out of my character, but the ultimate goal was to get somewhere where I could compete, and here I am in Brooklyn. I have nothing but love and respect for that organization, that city, and everything it has ever done for me and my family. Much respect.\u201d With Harden joining Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in Brooklyn, the Nets now have three players with All-NBA talent. \u201cIt\u2019s not a guarantee that me coming to Brooklyn is guaranteeing a title, but I think for me, giving myself a chance is very, very important,\u201d Harden said. \u201c[When I was] younger, giving myself a chance [was important], but wanting to get paid and wanting to take care of my family was very, very important to me. Now, at this stage of my career, it\u2019s giving myself a chance to do something that I haven\u2019t accomplished yet in this league. That\u2019s very important to me now, and that\u2019s the situation that I\u2019m in. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here in Brooklyn. I\u2019m excited for the opportunity. Obviously, we know it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not gonna be easy at all. But with this roster, this coaching staff and this organization, I think we have a legit chance.\u201d Brooklyn was Harden\u2019s preferred destinations all along, which he confirmed, and Wednesday\u2019s move reunites him with former Oklahoma City teammate, Durant, as well as former Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who worked with the All-Star guard for four seasons in Houston and is now an assistant on the Nets\u2019 staff. Harden and Durant have captured seven of the last 11 NBA scoring titles, and according to Elias Sports Bureau, become the fifth pair of teammates in league history to play on the same team after winning multiple scoring titles. Harden thanked the Houston Rockets organization and the city\u2019s fans Friday in an Instagram post , and later discussed what Net fans can expect from the team\u2019s newest addition. \u201cAn elite player, an elite teammate, an elite leader and just a guy that\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to rack up as many wins as we can; sacrifice,\u201d Harden said. \u201cIt means a lot. Just coming from eight years in Houston, having a fresh start with some unbelievable talent, the coaching staff. Ultimately, it\u2019s a chance for me to compete for a title.\u201d The start of the chase could come as soon as Saturday, as Nets coach Steve Nash hopes Harden can start against the Orlando Magic. Nash expressed uncertainty about whether the new acquisition would get the opportunity to play alongside Irving, who was fined $50,000 by the league for violating health and safety protocols for attending an indoor gathering of 15 people or more. Irving has been out the past five games because of personal reasons. That didn\u2019t temper Nash\u2019s excitement about adding Harden to an already potent roster, as the coach pointed out the move was a must for a team harboring championship aspirations. Nash expects the Nets to experience a period of adjustment as Harden learns to play with Durant and Irving, after playing such a ball-dominant role in Houston. \u201cWe obviously got one of the premier players in the world,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWe want to win a championship for sure. That\u2019s why we made the deal. We\u2019re a brand-new entity that has to figure it out, but that is the end goal.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

He\u2019s got a friendly matchup with the Clippers tonight and, as mentioned above, this game has the highest over\/under at 231.5. Patrick Beverly (LAC) vs. SAC: $4,000 PatBev has provided some big games as of late, and at just $4K, he\u2019s certainly worth a look tonight. Clippers\/Kings has the highest over\/under on the slate, which should provide some additional opportunities. If he\u2019s unavailable, Reggie Jackson (SG, $3.8K) is worth a look. Marcus Smart (BOS) vs. ORL: $6,200 One of the best values on the slate is Smart, who finds himself in the starting lineup for a Celtics team still without Kemba Walker and now without Jayson Tatum. Jaylen Brown is questionable, and if Brown is out, Smart would be the value of the night. Nickeil Alexander- Walker (NOP) vs. LAL: 5,500 NAW went off for 37\/8 and 50.1 FD points Wednesday after joining the Pelicans\u2019 starting lineup. With Lonzo Ball out and Eric Bledsoe questionable, Alexander-Walker has a great shot at garnering another start and smashing value. Anthony Edwards (MIN) vs. MEM: $4,500 Edwards has scored a measly 13.8 FD points across his last two games combined, but there\u2019s certainly a chance for him to bounce back in a friendly matchup with Memphis tonight in which Ricky Rubio will be out. Malik Beasley (MIN) vs. MEM: $6,400 Small forward is an absolute mess on tonight\u2019s slate, but if we\u2019re looking to save a little money, Beasley fits the bill. He\u2019s averaged better than 30 FD points this season, including 47.7 against Memphis on Wednesday. De\u2019Andre Hunter (ATL) vs. UTA: $6,000 Hunter gets a great draw with Utah on tonight\u2019s slate, and aside from scoring 26.9 FD points in his last outing, he\u2019s provided huge value as of late and averaged just over 30 FD points per game on the season. Kristaps Porzingis (DAL) vs. MIL: $7,400 KP scored 26.8 FD points in 21 minutes Wednesday as he made his season debut. If he can see even a slight increase in minutes tonight, he\u2019s got a great chance to provide value. Aaron Gordon (ORL) vs. BOS: $6,500 Gordon has too much upside to be priced at just $6.5K. He\u2019s averaged over 38 FD points across his last two games and gets a great draw with a shorthanded Celtics squad tonight. Jonas Valanciunas (MEM) vs. MIN: $7,000 Minnesota is one of the best matchups for opposing centers, and at just $7K, Valanciunas is a solid dollar-for-dollar option against the same team he just posterized for 50 FD points Wednesday. Mitchell Robinson (NYK) vs. CLE: $6,000 Blockinson gets a solid draw against Cleveland, and he\u2019s very affordable at just $6K.

In a post Friday on Instagram, Harden posted a video and thank-you message to Houston for the eight-plus seasons he spent with them. \u201cWhat can I write?

The NBA fined the point guard $50,000 on Friday for violating its health and safety protocols, and said he could return to team activities Saturday. The league added that he would forfeit his salary for each game he misses during a five-day quarantine period that would end Saturday if he continues to test negative for the coronavirus. He\u2019s already missed two, which means he has lost nearly $900,000 of his $33.5 million salary. Irving has missed the last five games while away from the Nets for personal reasons. He was seen in a video on social media during his absence at an indoor family party while not wearing a mask. The league\u2019s protocols prohibit attending indoor social gatherings of 15 or more people or entering bars, lounges, clubs or similar establishments. Irving is the second player to be fined for that. The other is his new teammate, James Harden. The Nets have not explained the reasons for Irving\u2019s absence, leaving it to him to do when he returns. Their next game is Saturday against Orlando, though coach Steve Nash said Friday he had no update about when Irving would rejoin the team. \u201cWithout a doubt, the organization\u2019s disappointed with not having any one of our players, in this particular case Kyrie, not amongst us, not in the trenches with us and so forth,\u201d general manager Sean Marks said Thursday during a news conference to discuss the trade for Harden. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to speculate and say why he\u2019s out and so forth.

If anything, there\u2019s much good fortune associated with it, for the league itself and definitely for the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers, because it relates to the game\u2019s most precious commodity and driving force behind the Lakers\u2019 bid to go back-to-back. LeBron James is 13-for-13 \u2026 13 games played , no games missed. That might sound very so-so and no-big-deal, but then you\u2019d be guilty of taking LeBron and what he\u2019s doing \u2014 still \u2014 for granted, which is easy to do because he makes his job look so easy. But of all the players who could be excused for having their minutes and games rationed, LeBron stands in front of the line. Remember, the Lakers (along with the Miami Heat) had the least amount of time off between the end last season, which lasted until Oct 11, and the start of this season on Dec. 22. LeBron also played at a level that was several ozone layers above anyone else in 2019-20, finishing second in the Kia MVP vote and then bulldozing through the postseason to win his fourth championship and another Finals MVP. All that, at age 35. Now here he is, a year older, but nothing has changed much. LeBron is LeBron. He\u2019s sturdy, frisky, leading his team to the best record so far in the league, and currently holding pole position for the 2020-21 Kia MVP. Yes, it\u2019s early for that kind of talk \u2026 but never too premature to put LeBron and his astonishing endurance in the proper context. Sure, there are other developments currently capturing the imagination and attention of the NBA: The excitement LaMelo Ball is bringing to the Hornets; the James Harden trade and The Notorious Big Three that\u2019s in place in Brooklyn; Stephen Curry back near the top of the scoring charts; Joel Embiid looking beastly in Philadelphia. All is well and good. Then there\u2019s LeBron and the continuation of greatness here in his 18th season, nothing new or unusual or trendy about that, of course. It\u2019s almost as if what we\u2019re seeing is normal, and it\u2019s everything but that. There are players who\u2019ve had longer careers, and arguably one player who\u2019s had a better career, but no player is putting those two together quite like LeBron. There are scant, if any, signs of decay in his game, or erosion of skills, or decline of strength and power, and no slippage in smarts. There are entire teams that have missed more games this season than LeBron. And on that subject, it would be easy for the Lakers to pull the reigns, especially since the Lakers are off to a 10-3 start and could afford to sit him, and also because there are no ticket-buying fans who would be disappointed. Instead, LeBron is averaging 31.9 minutes per game, burning calories and the man guarding him, averaging 24.3 ppg, 8.1 rpg and 7.5 apg \u2014 all without missing a beat or a game so far. He explains by saying it\u2019s \u201cjust me playing the game that I love to play.\u201d He\u2019s also continuing to evolve, which is always for the better of his legacy and his team. Last season his goal was to become the game\u2019s finest facilitator, and so he led the league in assists. That was important because besides Anthony Davis, the Lakers lacked players who could create their own shots. This season, he\u2019s placing a heavy emphasis on shooting. He\u2019s attempting 6.4 3-pointers per game, the most on the Lakers. And although he did suffer a 1-for-11 stretch recently over two games, he\u2019s connecting on a very respectable 38.6% \u2014 none bolder than his no-look shot from the deep corner in front of the Lakers\u2019 bench Tuesday that went viral. The outside shooting is by design. Instead of punishing his limbs by constantly getting points in the paint and absorbing contact here in his mid 30s, LeBron can preserve himself \u2014 and still have just as good, if not better, of an impact in games \u2014 by stretching the floor and shooting 3-pointers and making himself more unpredictable on offense. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging him to beat defenses over the top,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple reasons for that: He\u2019s probably the best shooter on our team, and they play him softly. They go under screens on him \u2026 In terms of the \u2018four-point-range\u2019 shots that he takes, he\u2019s got a green light to take those because he makes them.\u201d Because of LeBron\u2019s strong start, the Lakers are surging strong heading into their Friday game against the New Orleans Pelicans. They\u2019ve lost once since the calendar flipped, although there\u2019s a decent argument that they haven\u2019t been challenged by the best. They\u2019ve only played three teams currently with a winning record, and won\u2019t be tested until later this month when the Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics show up. But if LeBron continues this pace, not only will the Lakers be well-positioned to cruise into the season\u2019s break with the best record, LeBron will nearly cement his status as the game\u2019s longevity king. Only a few players in history \u2014 Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar mainly \u2014 have performed at a level considered at or near an All-NBA level this deep into their 30s. At the very least, LeBron\u2019s string of All-NBA honors (16 times) and considerable MVP consideration (he\u2019s won four) is all but assured. Then it becomes: How much longer can he sustain this pace? His body has only betrayed him once, when a groin injury cut short his first season with the Lakers. Otherwise, LeBron appears as bullet-proof as ever. The greatness and the consistency and the durability combine to keep him on the floor at the tip, and until that changes, the tendency to take him for granted will remain. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less spectacular on most nights. As Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma said: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest to play this game, and the things that he does is always crazy to watch in real time.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Nurkic could be seen holding the wrist after swiping at the ball in the third quarter, and he fell to the floor after contact under Indiana\u2019s basket. At a timeout he went to to the locker room and did not return. On replay, it looks as though the injury occurred when Nurkic swiped at the ball on a Malcom Brogdan drive near the 8:45 mark of the third quarter. He immediately grabbed his right wrist but still managed to contest a shot attempt, which sent the center to the ground as the Blazers went the other way in transition. The Pacers would call timeout after the Blazers scored, with Nurkic going straight to the locker room with the team medical staff. The 7-foot-0 Bosnian was averaging 10.3 points and 7.6 rebounds heading into the game. The injury puts Nurkic\u2019s season and the Trail Blazers\u2019 hopes of a top seed in the Western Conference in jeopardy, especially with young big man Zach Collins also sidelined due to ankle surgery.

Marks said Thursday that both Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving told him what he needed to hear, so he pulled the trigger on the blockbuster deal that landed the NBA\u2019s three-time scoring champion in Brooklyn. \u201cThey understand what\u2019s at stake here,\u201d Marks said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s raised their hands and said, \u2018Look, we\u2019re in. We know what we\u2019re shooting for\u2019 and that includes James, the new player. He knows what\u2019s at stake.\u201d The Nets acquired Harden from Houston in a multiteam deal that became official Thursday, paying a huge price by sending Caris LeVert and Rodions Kurucs to Houston, along with 2022, 2024 and 2026 first-round picks and the right to swap first-round picks in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027. The Nets also sent center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince to Cleveland. Brooklyn now has undeniable firepower, with Durant a four-time scoring champion who looks as good as ever in his return from Achilles tendon surgery and Irving pouring in nearly as many points before taking a leave of absence from the team for personal reasons. But only the commitment from the three players will allow the Nets to fully utilize it and Marks is confident he secured that from his own players and from Harden. \u201cI think he\u2019s looking for a fresh start and I think these guys are going to have to sacrifice without a doubt,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also going to push us. They\u2019re going to push our franchise and hopefully take us to where we need to go.\u201d Harden was due to arrive in Brooklyn on Thursday and Marks believed he could be cleared to play once all the players in the deal had passed their physicals. The Nets play Saturday against Orlando and then Monday in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day showdown with Milwaukee that now looks like a potential preview of the Eastern Conference finals. Harden\u2019s unhappiness in Houston had been clear since he arrived late and out of shape to training camp. Marks said the Nets had been looking into the situation before things truly sped up over the last 48 hours \u2014 though said that was unrelated to Irving\u2019s absence. He said he never had to address sacrificing shots with the superstars, because they did it first. \u201cThey were the ones to bring it up right off the bat, which was, they want to win,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I heard from James, is, \u2018I want to win, I\u2019m all about winning.\u2019\u201d The deal comes with huge future risks, and few organizations know them better than the Nets. They gave away years of picks in the trade to get Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett in 2013, managing only a second-round playoff appearance while Boston rebuilt one of the top teams in basketball with picks that became even more valuable after Brooklyn tumbled toward the basement. Marks denied the Nets had again mortgaged their future, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not bankrupt right now.\u201d And with a clear window to win with all three players under contract at least through next season, he may have made the move anyway. \u201cAt the end of the day, it goes back to when you have the opportunity to add James Harden to your roster, you\u2019re certainly going to do your due diligence and you\u2019re going to do everything you possibly can to make that happen,\u201d Marks said. The Nets will have to fill out a roster that has holes, though Marks said he won\u2019t rush that. He wants to see how the current team fits and it\u2019s unclear how soon that can happen, with Irving\u2019s return date still unknown after a five-game absence. Marks said Irving has continued daily coronavirus testing while gone, which could pave the way for a quick return once he rejoins the team. He has been talking to Irving but wouldn\u2019t say why he remains out, saying the point guard would eventually do that. \u201cI think it\u2019s been well documented that if there\u2019s reasonable excuses for their absence, fine, we have got to support, whether it\u2019s our players or whether it\u2019s our staff, and you would do that in any industry,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut you also hope there is an adequate, more than adequate excuse as to like, why he needs personal time. And he will address that without a doubt.\u201d Irving and Durant are close friends who came to Brooklyn together as free agents in 2019. Durant and Harden were teammates in Oklahoma City and have remained close. Marks believes those prior relationships are another reason the players will be willing to leave behind their egos and a few shot attempts. If they do, the Nets might meet the expectations that Marks said he won\u2019t run from. \u201cI think everybody knows what this team is positioned and potentially capable of doing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to get everybody jelling, get everybody on the same page and I don\u2019t know if that takes two games, 10 games, 20 games, whatever it is. But there\u2019s certainly the talent there.\u201d"},{"id":474602,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-nets-acquire-james-harden-trade","date":"2021-01-14","title":"Nets acquire James Harden in blockbuster trade","content":"James Harden is heading to Brooklyn, joining old teammate Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to give the Nets a potent trio of the some of the NBA\u2019s highest scorers. The Nets acquired the three-time scoring champion from the Houston Rockets on Wednesday in a move he has sought for weeks. The trade also involves the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the trade, the Nets send center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince to Cleveland, and guard Caris LeVert and forward Rodions Kurucs, as well as three first round draft picks (2022, 2024 and 2026) and four first round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027) to Houston. The Rockets also receive guard Dante Exum and a 2022 first round draft pick from Cleveland (via Milwaukee), and Brooklyn acquires a 2024 second round draft pick from the Cavaliers to complete the deal. The deal will reportedly include a fourth team, the Indiana Pacers, but that aspect of the deal has not been made official yet. Per multiple reports, the Pacers would acquire LeVert and a future second-round pick from the Rockets in exchange for All-Star guard Victor Oladipo . In a statement released by the Rockets, team owner Tillman Fertitta said : \u201cOn behalf of the entire Rockets organization and the City of Houston, I\u2019d like to thank James Harden for an amazing eight-plus seasons in a Rockets uniform. James has provided us with so many great memories as we\u2019ve watched him grow from Sixth Man of the Year to a perennial All-Star and MVP. \u201cMy family and I also want to thank James for his many off the court contributions, including generous charitable donations and multiple annual community events. We wish James the best of luck and will always be grateful for the memories.\u201d The Nets are now able to trot out a lineup of three players capable of scoring 25 or more points on any night in a collection of firepower to rival any Big Three in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing move for Brooklyn. Obviously, they got better \u2014 way better,\u201d said two-time Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of Milwaukee. The Nets are loading up for a title run with three of the highest-paid players in the league. All are under contract through 2022-23, with Harden and Durant both set to earn more than $40 million in each of the next two seasons. In the meantime, the Nets were short-handed for their game against the New York Knicks, where coach Steve Nash declined to discuss Harden but did confirm that the players the Nets were trading were not in the building. The Nets beat the Knicks 116-109 thanks in large part to Durant\u2019s 26-point effort. Off to a 7-6 start in his rookie season, now the former point guard and two-time league MVP Nash will have to mold an offense that keeps the ball moving with three players worthy of having it in their hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple game but it becomes complicated when you put different personalities and players on the floor,\u201d Nash said. \u201cOur group\u2019s done a really good job being unselfish this year and trying to move the ball and work together so I\u2019ve been proud of that.\u201d The blockbuster deal provides a needed boost amid a period of drama for both franchises. It was struck less than 24 hours after Harden seemed to deliver a farewell address of sorts following the Rockets\u2019 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night, and just before Irving was set to miss a fifth straight game during a personal absence from the Nets. Harden, who has cycled through Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook as teammates in recent seasons, didn\u2019t think much of the roster the Rockets had around him this season. \u201cWe\u2019re just not good enough \u2026 I love this city. I literally have done everything that I can,\u201d Harden said Tuesday night. \u201cI mean, this situation is crazy. It\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think can be fixed.\u201d It couldn\u2019t, and now he\u2019s gone. Brooklyn expects Harden to leave all that behind him and that his transition to the Nets is smooth. He should be much happier in Brooklyn, having teamed with Durant in Oklahoma City when they were younger and remaining close still. It was obvious the end was nearing Wednesday, when the Rockets told him they didn\u2019t want him at practice after his inflammatory comments about the team. \u201cWe felt it was best for James and best for the group for him not to come to practice,\u201d first-year coach Stephen Silas said. About two hours later, ESPN and The Athletic first reported that Harden was being moved. The disgruntled superstar, who was unable to get the Rockets past the Western Conference finals, had remained quiet through months of reports that he was unhappy in Houston. Silas called the drama surrounding Harden an \u201call-around messed up situation.\u201d The Nets were ready to swoop in, after a shaky defense during the early season proved their best chance to beat teams might be to outscore them. They can certainly do that now. Durant is averaging 29.9 points in his first season back from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon, and Irving was scoring 27.1 per game before leaving the team last week. Harden, who appears to be out of shape after joining the Rockets after training camp began, is averaging 24.8 this season after three straight seasons above 30, culminating in MVP honors in 2018. The Rockets are just 3-6 so far this season and only Minnesota has a worse record in the Western Conference. The team is clearly in disarray and new arrival John Wall called the situation \u201crocky.\u201d Harden won each of the last three scoring titles by notable margins \u2014 2.3 points over Anthony Davis in 2017-18, 8.1 points over Paul George in 2018-19 and 3.8 points over Bradley Beal last season. His average so far this season ranked 18th in the NBA, well off his usual pace. It could pick back up again in Brooklyn, where Nash\u2019s assistant running the offense is Mike D\u2019Antoni, Harden\u2019s coach during his best seasons in Houston. D\u2019Antoni didn\u2019t return after last season and it quickly became clear Harden wanted to be gone, too. He was a no-show when camp opened and was later fined $50,000 for conduct detrimental to the league after attending an indoor event without a mask in violation of the NBA\u2019s health and safety protocols. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":475180,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/power-rankings-notebook-week-4","date":"2021-01-14","title":"Power Rankings Notebook: How James Harden trade impacts all 4 teams","content":"Each week during the season, NBA.com writer John Schuhmann surveys the league to compile stats and notes for his in-depth Power Rankings . Before the next rankings drop on Monday, we\u2019re taking a look at how Wednesday\u2019s blockbuster James Harden deal impacts all four teams involved. The James Harden situation in Houston escalated quickly, and less than 24 hours after saying \u201cIt\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think can be fixed,\u201d Harden was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in a deal that was made official Thursday morning . The trade pairs Harden with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on a Brooklyn team that traded two of the young players it has spent the last four seasons developing and sacrificed the next seven Drafts in an effort to win a championship now. For the Rockets, it\u2019s a reset. And, they are reportedly re-routing Caris LeVert to Indiana in exchange for Victor Oladipo, a deal which will give Houston more financial flexibility going forward. With the Rockets seemingly not interested in what the Nets had to offer themselves, the Cleveland Cavaliers got in on the deal and snagged a young talent to add to their core. Here are some notes and numbers regarding the teams and players involved in the two trades. Out: Jarrett Allen, Rodions Kurucs, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince, 3 first-round picks, 4 pick swaps, rights to Aleksandar Vezenkov (57th pick in 2017)  In: James Harden, 1 second-round pick The Draft picks are a huge sacrifice, but the Nets also lost depth, trading three rotation players for one. Harden obviously replaces LeVert as one of the primary ball-handlers, but Prince gave them versatility and Allen was their best true big. The Nets have three roster spots open and they could certainly use another center behind the 32-year-old DeAndre Jordan. Allen (though it\u2019s very possible that the Nets wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay him this summer) will be missed. But hey, they now have two of the greatest scorers in NBA history. Multiple seasons, a usage rate of 28%+, TS% of 60%+ Usage rate = % of team\u2019s possessions used (via FGA, TO & trips to the line) while on the floor TS% = True shooting percentage = PTS \/ (2 * (FGA + (0.44 *FTA))) 5 numbers to know: A bit of film: Harden can be a brilliant passer \u2026 Out: James Harden, 2 second-round picks  In: Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, Victor Oladipo, 4 first-round picks, 4 pick swaps, 1 second-round pick When a team trades a superstar, its most valuable picks are usually its own. The Rockets do sit in 14th place in the West after Wednesday, having lost four of their last five games . But they still have a group of eight or nine veterans that are capable of getting wins. This may not be last season\u2019s Oklahoma City Thunder, who finished fifth in the West after trading Paul George and Russell Westbrook for a trove of picks, but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad team, either. Two questions remain. First, how quickly will this new group come together? Second, are more trades coming? Oladipo and P.J. Tucker are both on expiring contracts. 5 numbers to know: A bit of film: Oladipo is an aware defender who\u2019s willing to sacrifice his body \u2026 Out: Victor Oladipo, 1 second-round pick  In: Caris LeVert, 1 second-round pick The Pacers have taken well to the changes that new coach Nate Bjorkgren has brought to both ends of the floor. Through Wednesday, they\u2019re one of three teams \u2014 the Lakers and Bucks are the others \u2014 that rank in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Oladipo was averaging 20 ppg and looked better than he did last season, but still not as explosive as he did before his knee injury two years ago. LeVert is two years younger than Oladipo and is under contract until 2022-23. Having dealt with injuries himself, he\u2019s never had an extended run of production in his four seasons. But he gives the Pacers some more juice off the dribble, ranking 12th with 14.5 drives per game. 5 numbers to know: A bit of film: LeVert can drop a dime when he weaves his way into the paint \u2026 Out: Dante Exum, 1 first-round pick, 1 second-round pick  In: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, rights to Aleksandar Vezenkov (57th pick in 2017) The Cavs got a really good young player (Allen turns 23 in April) for a couple of picks, and the 2022 first rounder they traded was that of the Bucks, which lost value when Giannis Antetokounmpo signed his contract extension last month. The one issue with Allen is that he\u2019s a restricted free agent this year, so he\u2019ll need to get paid. The Cavs have a very crowded frontcourt, even with Kevin Love (calf strain) on the shelf. They\u2019ve played Andre Drummond, JaVale McGee and Larry Nance Jr. together for 14 total minutes this season. Drummond and McGee are only under contract for this season, but coach J.B. Bickerstaff will have trouble finding minutes for all his bigs in the short term. 5 numbers to know: A bit of film: Allen has added quite a bit of polish to his offensive game since he came into the league \u2026 Check back on Monday for an updated NBA.com Power Rankings featuring stats and notes on all 30 teams. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Celtics general manager Danny Ainge, in a radio interview Thursday, said \u201cit looks like we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d Boston had three games that would have been played between Sunday and Wednesday postponed because some players were positive and others were ruled out because contact tracing showed that they could have been exposed to the virus. League-wide, eight games since Sunday have been postponed and the NBA was reviewing if more games \u2014 including a Saturday contest in Phoenix and a Sunday game in Washington \u2014 would have to be pushed back. The Suns and Wizards were both scheduled to play Friday; those games were postponed because contact tracing showed neither club would meet the NBA requirement of having eight available players. \u201cI think that our players are all doing well,\u201d Ainge said in an appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub. \u201cWe have some that are in contact tracing also.

And more tests are likely coming for the NBA, which revealed Wednesday that 16 players tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week. League officials, in a memo obtained by The Associated Press, have told teams that they are deciding whether to have additional game-day testing for players and referees. Teams in all 28 NBA cities have been told to investigate if there is a local lab that can process PCR tests relatively quickly; the extra tests would be conducted on game-day mornings and turn in results no later than one hour before tip-off. The league regimen already includes daily PCR tests for players and coaches, and rapid tests on game days. The NBA told teams it was possible that a decision could be made on the extra layer of testing by the weekend. ESPN first reported the contents of the league\u2019s memo.

He scored 34.9 FD points across 36 minutes Tuesday in a starting role, but his price remains unbelievably cheap. Dejounte Murray (SAS) vs. HOU: $7,500 Murray is coming off a couple of down games relative to his price tag, but he\u2019s a great bet to break value this evening, facing an already-generous Houston defense that will be extremely shorthanded. Edmond Sumner (IND) vs. POR: $3,500 Sumner played 30 minutes Tuesday, and if he can see similar court time tonight, he could exceed his bottom-dollar price tag. Coming in at the lowest possible price, Sumner is worth a look in GPPs as a pivot option from some of the chalkier plays of the night. Tyler Herro (MIA) vs. PHI: $6,500 Herro has scored better than 40 FD points in two straight, and he should be asked to carry the offense tonight with all of Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic out of action. Herro is moderately priced with a huge ceiling. Tyrese Maxey (PHI) vs. MIA: $5,600 After his 60.4 FD-point eruption a week ago, Maxey has eclipsed 30 FD points in two straight. Philly is beginning to get back to full strength, but his recent performances have surely earned him a regular role in the Sixers\u2019 rotation. He\u2019s got a ton of upside at just $5.6K. David Nwaba (HOU) vs. SAS: $4,800 Houston will be sporting a skeleton crew tonight, and Nwaba figures to see heavy minutes against the Spurs. Priced under $5K, he\u2019s a big-time value tonight. If you want to spend down even further, Ben McLemore is just $3.7K. Eric Gordon (HOU) vs. SAS: $5,200 Gordon is questionable tonight, but if he\u2019s good to go, he\u2019s being comically undervalued at just $5.2K. Expect high usage and big minutes if he\u2019s cleared to play. Precious Achiuwa (MIA) vs. PHI: $4,100 Achiuwa joined Miami\u2019s starting lineup Tuesday and posted 37.1 FD points across 35 minutes. He should be in line for a similar workload tonight for the shorthanded Heat, making him an excellent value play. Jae\u2019Sean Tate (HOU) vs, SAS: $4,000 Tate makes a nice low-dollar option here, especially if Gordon is unable to go. Houston\u2019s thinned-out lineup will need all the help it can get. Kelly Olynyk (MIA) vs. PHI: $5,300 At just $5.3K, Olynyk makes one of the night\u2019s best values. He\u2019s averaged 38 minutes across his last two contests and scored at least 36 FD points in each outing. He\u2019s priced far too cheaply here. PJ Washington (CHA) vs. TOR: $6,500 Washington\u2019s got an excellent matchup this evening, and with Gordon Hayward (hip) potentially out of action, Washington could see increased run. I\u2019d also take a long look at Miles Bridges ($4.3K, SF) if Hayward indeed sits. DeMarcus Cousins (HOU) vs. SAS: $4,600 It\u2019s time to snap up Cousins tonight as he is a great value option for only $4.6K. He should be in line for an increase in minutes and usage that could allow him to easily smash value.

James Harden and the blockbuster trade he forced Wednesday (and became official early Thursday morning) is all of that and more. Everyone knew the meteor was gonna hit. It was just a matter of when and how much of a dent it would make on the NBA Earth. And a sizable one it was. Harden leaves the Rockets, joins a fresh Big Three in Brooklyn and two other teams pitched in with the deal to get their share of the pie. While multiple players and future first-round picks galore were scattered about, the centerpiece of course is a former Kia MVP and three-time scoring champ who, after eight seasons in Houston, had had enough. The Rockets never reached The Finals with Harden, trying and failing to find him a co-star that could help over that time. Harden went through Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, and now gets to try his luck with former MVP and Oklahoma City teammate Kevin Durant and \u2014 depending on his situation \u2014 Kyrie Irving. There\u2019s a lot to sort through, and a picture that will eventually develop once the trade dust settles. (Keep in mind that, because of the picks involved \u2014 they stretch to 2027 \u2014 anyone wanting to instantly see a final verdict will be very disappointed.) Here\u2019s a sense of what the various teams and players involved are feeling at the moment: James Harden: The forced breakup with the Rockets was nasty and uncomfortable, but maybe it had to be in order to happen. Harden comes away with a smudge on his rep for behaving like a bratty and unprofessional superstar. But in the end, he was the clear winner. All the deserved criticism thrown his way doesn\u2019t matter now. He got exactly what he wanted. He\u2019s in the easier conference, reunited with Kevin Durant, will share the ball with Kyrie Irving and has his best chance yet at a title. The trick now for Harden is reinventing himself on the fly. No longer will the team revolve around his supreme isolation skills, and there will be nights when he\u2019s the third option, which could be a jolt to someone who finished high in the MVP vote over the last half-decade. Can his thirst for a title overtake his ego? Evidently he\u2019s confident it will, or else he wouldn\u2019t have named Brooklyn as his preferred destination. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see Harden play off the ball and become more of a catch-and-shooter, and how he reacts when Kyrie waves him off, and whether he can overcome a shaky postseason body of work to gain the confidence in his two fellow stars, both former Finals heroes. Curiously, this will be the challenge for Mike D\u2019Antoni, the Nets\u2019 offensive guru who couldn\u2019t lead Harden to the finish line in Houston. The Nets: Of course you remember how the Nets gambled their future on Old Paul Pierce and Old Kevin Garnett and how that turned out. Obviously, though, this isn\u2019t the same situation; Harden is still in his prime, a threat to score 40 on any given night. Besides, the three first-round picks and four first-round swaps that Brooklyn just surrendered might not be lottery jackpots like those Celtics picks became, provided the Brooklyn Big Three remain healthy and productive. Hey, it\u2019s a gamble, and that\u2019s what you must do to get a player of Harden\u2019s caliber. Gone also are Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen, a pair of solid young rotational players. But the good news for Brooklyn is Joe Harris wasn\u2019t sacrificed, and a 51% shooter from 3-point range will see more open looks than he ever dreamed. This is a big swing for the Nets, who are all-in and must win at least one title in the next two or three years to justify the trade. Their bench is thinner, especially when you account for Spencer Dinwiddie\u2019s season-ending injury, and their potential issues on defense and rebounding. But they can add a piece or two after the buyout deadline to restock, or sign a player currently unemployed on the cheap. Victor Oladipo: A few years ago he was an All-NBA selection with a fresh contract and unlimited future that looked secure. Now he\u2019s on his fourth team, still trying to recapture the level he enjoyed before his injury and facing free agency this summer. Oladipo has shown a few throwback flashes this season, but were they teases or a more concrete hint of what\u2019s to come in Houston? This could work out for him provided he meshes with John Wall and enjoys a rebound of a year. He\u2019ll get every opportunity to do so. There\u2019s money on the line, and a reputation to restore. Caris LeVert: He gave everyone a glimpse of what he could do if given the chance to be a primary option during last season\u2019s restart. Not only did he have big scoring nights, he accepted the challenge of taking big shots. That said, you still can\u2019t be totally sold that LeVert has the skills to be That Guy. His body of work screams Shotgun Rider. Anyway, he\u2019ll have the chance to be both on any given night with the Pacers, whose No. 1 option, Domantas Sabonis, rarely strays from the paint. Best of all, LeVert is a blend-in kind of player whose lack of ego will be a welcome addition on a team with like-minded players. He\u2019s averaging 18.6 points and six assists in 27 minutes, and those numbers should only rise. The Rockets: Wouldn\u2019t you love to see all the deals the Rockets turned down for Harden over the last few months? Were any better than this? Did they wait too long and ultimately settle for a few cents less on the dollar when Harden hit the nuclear button Tuesday night and gave them no choice? Rarely do teams that trade superstars get equal value in return. This goes back to the 1960s and Wilt Chamberlain. Usually, the team that receives the most players is the one who loses in the deal, if only because stars are so tough to find and often tougher to keep. This represents a twist: Houston\u2019s main cache in the trade is picks, not players. And the verdict on those picks won\u2019t be known for several years. At least the Rockets unloaded a big contract and gave themselves flexibility moving forward. In order to maximize the haul, though, rookie general manager Rafael Stone must make sharp and sound decisions with those assets and his new-found cap space. The Pacers: What a smooth move by the Pacers, who were a limited partner in the four-team trade but made out quite well. Essentially, they traded Oladipo, a player they didn\u2019t really want who was on an expiring contract, for LaVert, a 26-year-old who\u2019s athletic and skilled and signed for the next three years. Indiana, therefore, brings LaVert, Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, Myles Turner and, when he heals, TJ Warren. That\u2019s a good core that could stay intact for years. Remember, small market teams that struggle to pay the luxury tax or attract big-time free agents must be creative when it comes to team building. And this latest maneuver certainly qualifies. Jarrett Allen: One of the league\u2019s premier shot-blockers goes from playing behind DeAndre Jordan to backing up Andre Drummond. And you could make a case that Allen is just as good if not better in some ways than both players. He\u2019s certainly the future in Cleveland given that Drummond becomes a free agent this summer and might be traded before that. It\u2019s a good trade for Allen personally because it was clearly done with keeping him in mind. Therefore, Allen shouldn\u2019t have to sweat out extension negotiations next summer and finally has a team to call his own. The Cavaliers: Funny how the Cavs have Allen, Drummond and JaVale McGee; that\u2019s 21 feet of centers. Only one of them is assured to be on the roster next season. If the Cavs are smart, they\u2019ll give Drummond a ton of minutes to play up his value and then take the best deal at the deadline. By adding Allen, the Cavs are gradually building a young core with upside. Allen, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro and Darius Garland are all under 23, and there\u2019s also Larry Nance Jr. just entering his prime. Now it\u2019s all about finding someone to take Kevin Love; that whopping contract extension they gave him is out of place on a team looking to adopt a different, younger personality. The East: Well, sure, this is a trade that sent vibrations from Brooklyn to Milwaukee and Boston and Miami and Philly. Three of those teams \u2014 Celtics, Heat and Sixers \u2014 were involved to different degrees on the Harden talks before declining the chance to get him. Well, now they\u2019ll really get him, so to speak. While the Nets were good enough to be taken seriously as contenders even before the trade, they\u2019ll now bring three stars, which gives them the edge over the others. Everything now depends on how well, and how quickly, the Nets make it work. Also, those other teams are probably hoping that Kyrie makes a habit of causing distractions like his ongoing leave of absence. Of the contending teams, the Bucks are probably the most worried about Harden going to the Nets. This is supposed to be Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s year, right, much like last year and the year before? We\u2019ll get to see how well that Jrue Holiday acquisition turns out; he\u2019ll certainly have his hands full defensively when the Bucks play Brooklyn. The West: By playing at a high level here on the other side of 35 and starting this season off with a spirited chase for MVP, LeBron James essentially sent Harden running. There\u2019s no other way to see it \u2014 Harden surrendered because he didn\u2019t like his chances in Houston. Well, that\u2019s one more contender LeBron and the Lakers can cross off the list. Also, Harden went East instead of joining a top team in the West. So unless the trade deadline helps the Clippers, Jazz, Nuggets, Suns or anyone else with title aspirations, the Lakers will see the same old in the West. Therefore, a sneaky \u201cwinner\u201d in the Harden trade was the defending champs. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

As part of the trade, Brooklyn sends center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince to Cleveland, and guard Caris LeVert and forward Rodions Kurucs, as well as three first round draft picks (2022, 2024 and 2026) and four first round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027) to Houston. The Rockets also receive guard Dante Exum and a 2022 first round draft pick from Cleveland (via Milwaukee), and Brooklyn acquires a 2024 second round draft pick from the Cavaliers to complete the deal. \u201cAdding an All-NBA player such as James to our roster better positions our team to compete against the league\u2019s best,\u201d said General Manager Sean Marks. \u201cJames is one of the most prolific scorers and playmakers in our game, and we are thrilled to bring his special talents to Brooklyn. While we are excited to welcome James and his family to the Nets, we also want to thank the players who are departing. Caris, Jarrett, Rodions and Taurean were instrumental to the team\u2019s success and have made an enormous impact on our organization. It has been a pleasure watching them grow both as players and as people and they will always be part of our Nets family. We wish each of them and their families all the best in the future.\u201d The league\u2019s Most Valuable Player in 2018, Harden (6\u20195\u201d, 220) has been named an All-Star in each of the last eight seasons (2013-20), which marks the second-longest active streak of All-Star appearances behind only LeBron James (16 consecutive appearances). He\u2019s a three-time scoring champion (2018-20) and became the first player to win three straight scoring titles since Kevin Durant did so from 2010-12. Harden was also the league leader in assists in 2017, and he\u2019s one of just six players in NBA history who have won both scoring and assist titles in their careers, joining James, Nate Archibald, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West and Russell Westbrook. Harden\u2019s six All-NBA First Team selections tie with Durant for the second-most among active players, trailing only James\u2019 NBA-record 13 first team honors. He ranks 36th on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list with 21,160 career points (fourth among active players) and 54th on the league\u2019s all-time assists list with 5,338 career assists (sixth among active players). Harden has appeared in 841 games (628 starts) across 12 NBA seasons with Houston (2012-21) and Oklahoma City (2009-12), registering career averages of 25.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 1.6 steals in 34.3 minutes per game while shooting 44.3 percent from the field, 36.3 percent from 3-point range and 85.8 percent from the free-throw line. In the 2019-20 season, Harden recorded averages of 34.3 points on 44.4 percent shooting from the field, 35.5 percent shooting from distance and 86.5 percent shooting from the free-throw line with 6.6 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 1.8 steals in 36.5 minutes per game through 68 regular season games, earning All-NBA First Team honors for the fourth straight season and finishing third in MVP voting. Since the start of his NBA career, Harden has played in 841 of a possible 885 regular season games, and no player has appeared in more games since the start of the 2009-10 season than Harden. The Compton, Calif., native has also never missed the playoffs in his NBA career, seeing action in 128 games (85 starts) in 11 postseason appearances and posting averages of 23.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.7 steals in 35.3 minutes per contest. He\u2019s made four trips to the Western Conference Finals in his career, twice with the Rockets (2015 and 2018) and twice with the Thunder (2011 and 2012). Harden has also represented the United States in international competition, earning a gold medal with the U.S. men\u2019s basketball team at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Harden was originally selected with the third overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Prior to beginning his NBA career, Harden spent two years (2007-09) at Arizona State, earning All-Pac-10 First Team honors twice and garnering consensus first-team All-America honors, as well as the Pac-10 Player of the Year award, in his second and final collegiate season. Allen saw action in 234 games (180 starts) in his four seasons (2017-21) with the Nets, posting averages of 10.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.4 blocks in 24.4 minutes per game. In the 2020-21 season, Allen has appeared in 12 games (five starts), registering averages of 11.2 points, 10.4 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.6 blocks in 26.6 minutes per game. The Austin, Texas, native was named to the Mtn Dew Ice Rising Stars as part of 2019 NBA All-Star Weekend in Charlotte during his sophomore season. He is also the Nets\u2019 all-time leader in field goal percentage (61.2 percent) and set the franchise\u2019s single-season record for field goal percentage last season (64.9 percent). The 22-year-old was originally selected with the 22nd overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft by Brooklyn. LeVert appeared in 225 games (96 starts) in five seasons (2016-21) in Brooklyn, averaging 13.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.1 steals in 25.9 minutes per game. In 12 games (four starts) this season, the Columbus, Ohio, native has registered averages of 18.5 points, 4.3 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 1.1 steals in 27.8 minutes per contest. The 26-year-old was originally selected with the 20th overall pick in the first round of the 2016 NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers and was traded to Brooklyn after the draft. Kurucs saw action in 115 games (55 starts) in three seasons with the Nets, recording averages of 6.5 points and 3.4 rebounds in 17.3 minutes per game. The Latvian native was originally selected with the 40th overall pick in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft by Brooklyn. Prince appeared in 272 games (204 starts) across five NBA seasons with Brooklyn (2019-21) and Atlanta (2016-19), registering averages of 11.4 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 26.0 minutes per game. In 76 games (65 starts) in Brooklyn, Prince averaged 11.4 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 27.3 minutes per contest. In the 2020-21 season, the San Antonio, Texas, native has seen action in 12 games (four starts), averaging 8.1 points and 2.8 rebounds in 18.1 minutes per contest. The 26-year-old was originally acquired by Brooklyn via trade with the Atlanta Hawks on July 6, 2019."},{"id":474916,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mavericks-feeling-better-with-kristaps-porzingis-back-in-action","date":"2021-01-14","title":"Mavericks feeling better with Kristaps Porzingis back in action","content":"Dallas Mavericks forward Kristaps Porzingis made his season debut Wednesday in the team\u2019s 104-93 win over the Charlotte Hornets, performing \u201cexceptionally well given the circumstances\u201d according to coach Rick Carlisle. \u201cI think everybody feels a lot better now that KP\u2019s back in the mix,\u201d Carlisle said. That\u2019s partly because the Mavericks came into the game shorthanded, missing Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Dwight Powell and Maxi Kleber as they continue to advance through the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols. In a game that Luka Doncic logged a career-high four blocked shots and finished one assist short of another triple-double (34 points, 13 rebounds, 9 assists), Carlisle captured his 800 th career win with Porzingis contributing 16 points, 4 rebounds and 2 blocks in 21 minutes. \u201cI enjoy winning, I enjoy competing. It\u2019s good to be out there,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back with my guys, and finally be a part of [it]. When I was out this time, these nine [or] 10 games, I was trying to stay as connected as I could to the team in timeouts and things like that. But, you can only do so much. \u201cYou actually want to be out there with everybody, playing and feel like you\u2019re doing your part. So, today, for the first time, I got that feeling back again. I\u2019m happy about the result, happy to be appreciated. I look forward to the next one.\u201d Starting the game at power forward, Porzingis knocked down 2 of 3 from deep in the first quarter for six points, as the Mavericks stormed to a 16-point lead after the first quarter on the strength of Doncic\u2019s 11 points. The instant offense felt as easy to Porzingis as it looked. \u201cBut what I think didn\u2019t help me was knowing that I had the minutes restriction,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cSo, I was trying to do as much as I could in those minutes that I had. Sometimes, you don\u2019t make the best decisions when you really want to be aggressive. It\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s a part of it. \u201cI wanted to be out there; be aggressive for the time I was gonna be out there. Most importantly, first game and first win for me. Looking forward to the next one, and just getting into a rhythm where everything comes easy and we find that chemistry out there. Then, we\u2019ll take off.\u201d Porzingis finished the first half shooting 4-of-10 from the field for 10 points. He played just nine minutes in the second half, sinking 2 of 6 (including 2 of 3 from deep) to go with 2 rebounds and 6 points. \u201cIt was great. He\u2019s an amazing player,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s his first game. He played, what, 20-something minutes? He\u2019s got to get back into rhythm. For the first game, he played amazing. He\u2019s gonna keep improving and we\u2019re gonna need him a lot.\u201d Porzingis pointed to past experience in zooming to Wednesday\u2019s fast start against the Hornets, which entered Wednesday\u2019s contest on a four-game winning streak. Remember, Porzingis sat out a season and a half recovering from a torn left ACL suffered in February of 2018, before the October setback in the opener of Dallas\u2019 playoff series against the LA Clippers eventually required surgery to repair a left lateral meniscus injury. Porzingis averaged 20.4 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2 blocks last season with the Mavericks. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting in a lot of work while I was out, just shooting, just being on the floor a lot more than when I was coming [back] from [the] ACL [injury],\u201d Porzingis explained. \u201cI was really out of rhythm and I could really tell I was really rusty when I was coming back. \u201cSo, I didn\u2019t want to allow that to happen again this time around. I put in a lot more time on the floor shooting, feeling the ball, things like that. Today, I already felt way better than when I was coming back. All I need now is just that time on the floor. I have the confidence because I have been putting in the work. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll have those minutes and I\u2019ll just play out there freely, instinctively, and enjoy the game.\u201d Carlisle, for sure, will be counting the days considering that so many Mavericks are currently advancing through the league\u2019s coronavirus protocols. On a four-game winning streak, including six wins in its last eight outings, Dallas hits the road to face the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday. \u201cRight now in the world, good health is something that none of us can take for granted whether it\u2019s having to do with a basketball-related rehab and recovery or whether it has to do with something COVID [related],\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two franchise players. It\u2019s important to have them on the floor together and available to play. If you look at every team in this league, if they\u2019re without one of their cornerstone guys it\u2019s gonna be a lot tougher job.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Fox is taking part January training camp with the U.S. women\u2019s national team in Florida. She was applauded by her teammates at dinner after the selection was announced. \u201cI feel like its a very unique opportunity for me to go on there and try to do as best that I can and work my way up, and do anything I can for the team,\u201d said Fox, one of three college players who were invited to take part in the national team\u2019s camp. Rodman was a freshman at Washington State, but the coronavirus outbreak postponed the fall season in the Pac-12. Because of an NCAA waiver, she could play for the Cougars this spring and join the Spirit afterward, but she said Wednesday she had decided to forgo her college career. \u201cHe was an amazing athlete and I got those genes from him,\u201d Rodman said about her famous dad. \u201cBut I am excited to be known as Trinity Rodman and not just Dennis Rodman\u2019s daughter.\u201d Midfielder Brianna Pinto out of North Carolina went to Sky Blue with the third pick. Pinto announced on Twitter on Tuesday that she was going to pursue a pro career, but said she would play this spring with the Tar Heels. Stanford\u2019s Kiki Pickett was selected by Kansas City with the fourth pick. Kansas City sent $175,000 in allocation money to Sky Blue in exchange for the pick. Midfielder Emina Ekic went to her hometown team, Racing Louisville, with the fifth selection. Ekic, a senior at Louisville, was the ACC Offensive Player of the Year.

Among other assets, the Rockets received Nets guard Caris LeVert, who was subsequently moved to the Pacers in exchange for Victor Oladipo. Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince will leave the Nets for Cleveland in this deal, while the Rockets land Cavaliers guard Dante Exum and Brooklyn forward Rodions Kurucs. In addition to the players, Houston receives Brooklyn\u2019s first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026; a Milwaukee first-round pick; and first-round pick swaps with the Nets in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic . Per Charania, all four first-round picks and all four first-round pick swaps sent to Houston are unprotected. How did we get here, you might ask? Here\u2019s a look at how Harden\u2019s remarks Tuesday after Houston\u2019s 117-100 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers sent a slow-moving Rockets trade train barreling into Wednesday\u2019s blockbuster chain of events. This clip of LeBron James in the second quarter highlighted an embarrassing Rockets loss to the Lakers that sent them spiraling toward the bottom of the Western Conference standings at 3-6. Lakers point guard Dennis Schroder revealed after the game that James\u2019 no-look 3-pointer came as the result of a bet made in the middle of the game. \u201cI told him to bet a Benjamin on it, so he shot it,\u201d Schroder said. \u201cShot it and turned around and said: \u2018Bet.\u2019 Then, it went in. It\u2019s just legendary.\u201d The loss marked the first time since Dec. 6, 2018 that no Rocket scored 20 points or more. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say there was a lack of fight or a lack of competitiveness,\u201d Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t bring the right intensity to the game.\u201d Harden took it a step further once his time came to address the media, and wasted no time levying harsh criticism of the Rockets in the wake of the fourth loss in the team\u2019s last five outings. Harden finished with 16 points on 5-of-16 shooting with six assists, marking the fourth straight game he didn\u2019t produce 20 points more for his longest such streak since 2012. That didn\u2019t stop Harden from unloading on the Rockets, which had just dropped two games in a row to the Lakers by a combined 35 points. \u201c We\u2019re just not good enough ,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close, honestly, to that team \u2013 obviously the defending champions \u2013 and to all the other elite teams out there. You can tell the difference in these last two games. Obviously, chemistry, talent-wise, everything, and it was clear these last few games. From the beginning of the game, they were just aggressive, veteran team, obviously, a championship team, and one of the best teams that we have in this league.\u201d \u201cI love this city,\u201d Harden added. \u201cI literally have done everything that I can. This situation is crazy. It\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think can be fixed.\u201d Harden abruptly ended his postgame availability after his scathing remarks, leaving new point guard John Wall to respond to the former MVP\u2019s criticisms of the team. Understandably, he was not pleased. \u201cWhen you have certain guys in the mix that don\u2019t want to buy in,\u201d Wall said, \u201cit\u2019s gonna be hard to do anything special, to do anything good as a basketball team. In my 11 years I\u2019ve been in the league, I\u2019ve been on teams like that my first five years where it was all about me, me, me, me, not about the team. And that hurts, and it brings everybody down.\u201d Wall later admitted to experiencing some chemistry issues on the floor with Harden. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a little rocky,\u201d Wall said. \u201cCan\u2019t lie about that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been the best it could be to be honest. That\u2019s all I really could say.\u201d A night to sleep on Tuesday\u2019s disastrous performance and Harden\u2019s critical remarks did little to assuage Silas\u2019 concerns regarding how the Rockets should proceed. So, the team convened at the Toyota Center for practice on Wednesday without Harden in the fold. \u201cWe felt it was best for James and the rest of the group for him not to come to practice today,\u201d Silas said. Asked whether the club needed to resolve the Harden situation before moving forward, Silas replied: \u201cYou would think so. There has to be some sort of resolution, whether it\u2019s a complete buy-in at some level or some other way to get it taken care of. It\u2019s not an easy situation by any stretch of the imagination. But for a team atmosphere and the good of the team, I\u2019ll say everybody needs to be pointed in the same direction.\u201d Silas admitted that Harden\u2019s criticisms Tuesday \u201cwere hard to hear, especially when you don\u2019t believe it and know it not to be true.\u201d \u201cYou want everybody to be on the same page,\u201d Silas said. \u201cYou want everybody to be committed to each other on an NBA team. With how things have gone the last few days \u2013 actually for a while \u2013 I\u2019m not sure [the relationship can be repaired].\u201d New Rockets big man DeMarcus Cousins implied that tension between Harden and teammates had been brewing long before the star guard voiced a lack of confidence in the club. \u201cMe, personally, I don\u2019t feel betrayed at all,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cMy interest is playing with John Wall to be brutally honest. With that being said, the disrespect started way before any interview.\u201d It all started back in early December, when Harden reported late for training camp. Before Harden could be cleared for work with the team, he needed to test negative for COVID-19 on six consecutive days. But during Harden\u2019s time away, pictures of the guard on a trip to Las Vegas circulated on social media, as did images of him attending a birthday party in Atlanta for rapper Lil Baby, while the rest of his Rockets teammates had already reported to training camp. \u201cJust the approach to training camp, showing up the way he did, the antics off the court,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI mean, the disrespect started way before. So, this isn\u2019t something that all of the sudden happened last night. With that being said, this is the nasty part of the business. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s a way about handling business. He can feel however he wants to feel about the organization or whatever his current situation is. But the other 14 guys in the locker room have done nothing to him. So, for us to be on the receiving end of some of the disrespectful comments and antics, it\u2019s completely unfair to us. \u201cWe\u2019ve done nothing to him. We\u2019ve only showed up to work just like everybody else and came in ready to work. It\u2019s completely unfair to the rest of the guys in the locker room.\u201d With Harden sequestered from the Houston Rockets, the club\u2019s previously slow-moving trade talks intensified, according to Charania and Sam Amick of The Athletic. Silas said he spoke to Harden earlier Wednesday and admitted to enduring a sleepless night wrestling with how the team should proceed in the wake of the star guard\u2019s remarks. Those criticisms, no doubt, played a role in the Rockets accelerating efforts to move Harden after previously hoping he\u2019d come around. Despite all that had transpired, Silas spoke highly of Harden on Wednesday. \u201cJames gave me a chance,\u201d Silas said. \u201cI spoke to James before I was offered the job. That was the last domino that needed to fall in order for me to get this job. James was nothing but professional to me, and we\u2019ve had some good conversations. So, as far as his commitment to me, it\u2019s been good, and just a crazy NBA situation. It really is. \u201cI know that all the questions are trying to kind of maybe finger-point or find a story in it. But it\u2019s really just one of those kind of all-around messed-up situations that\u2019s hard to kind of quantify and kind of wrap your mind around in figuring out the best way to have the group move forward. That\u2019s my job, and it was a sleepless night last night trying to figure out what the best way to do that would be.\u201d With the Nets releasing a statement on Tuesday regarding the absence of star guard Kyrie Irving, who remains away from the team due to personal reasons, the club solidified a contingency plan in case of an extended unavailability. Either way, the trade for Harden makes the Nets a legitimate contender in the Eastern Conference. With Harden joining Kevin Durant and Irving in Brooklyn, the Nets now have three players who made the 2018-19 All-NBA First Team (Harden) or Second Team (Durant and Irving). Brooklyn, reportedly, was one of Harden\u2019s preferred destinations all along. The deal reunites Harden with Durant, his former Oklahoma City teammate, as well as former Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who worked with the All-Star guard for four seasons in Houston and is now an assistant on the Nets\u2019 staff. Harden and Durant have captured seven of the last 11 NBA scoring titles and, according to Elias Sports Bureau, become the fifth pair of teammates in league history to play on the same team after winning multiple scoring titles. * * * Michael C.

(AP) \u2014 Kristaps Porzingis scored 16 points in his return from a knee injury and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Charlotte Hornets 104-93 on Wednesday night. Porzingis played for the first time since having knee surgery in October. The 7-foot-3 Latvian impacted the game at both ends with his size, easily able to shoot over smaller defenders while altering shots in the paint against the smaller Hornets.

Such is the perplexing and somewhat frustrating relationship between New York and the two NBA teams that call it home. In the chase to see who can rise up and become king of the hill, the Knicks and Nets, right now anyway, are stuck in an elevator. They meet Wednesday night, although there\u2019s nothing on the line unless you put a special emphasis on eighth place in the East in January. In the more important bigger picture, though, the NBA\u2019s biggest market is seeking the kind of attention that only a winner can bring, and it finds the Knicks and Nets somewhat desperate, in their own distinct ways, to gain the affections of a starved city. The Knicks of Manhattan are going through yet another reinvention \u2014 everyone has lost count how many \u2014 and once again are without a transformational player on the roster or a clear path on the horizon. Meanwhile, the Nets of Brooklyn are seemingly built to last \u2026 but wait, their quirky star guard, Kyrie Irving, is once again trapped in limbo. It\u2019s just a weird existence for New York, where a blacktop can be found on almost every street corner, where basketball is by far the most popular participant sport among kids and teenagers, and where fans are among the most educated about the sport you\u2019ll ever find. But at its highest level, basketball doesn\u2019t share the same dominance or return the same amount of love it\u2019s getting. In the last two decades of New York City professional basketball \u2014 the Knicks since 2000 and the Nets since they moved from New Jersey in 2012 \u2014 those teams have combined to win just two playoff rounds. In that stretch, they\u2019ve had 23 head coaches, including interims. That reflects the level of instability and transitional phases shared by both teams lately. The amount of stumbles and setbacks are multiple: The Nets giving three first-rounders plus a swap to Boston, which became lottery picks, for aged Paul Pierce and aged Kevin Garnett \u2026 the Knicks armed with top-10 picks and coming away with Mike Sweetney, Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox \u2026 the Nets trading a first to Portland for Gerald Wallace and then compounding the mistake by giving Wallace a big contract in free agency while the pick became Damian Lillard \u2026 the Knicks hiring Phil Jackson to run the team and Derek Fisher to coach \u2026 the bad breakup between Jason Kidd the coach and the franchise he once led to back-to-back NBA Finals as a player. Forbes Magazine has the Knicks and Nets valued at $7 billion, and the teams \u2014 especially the Knicks \u2014 have spent lavishly on payroll in the recent past. Yet there\u2019s little to no return on the investment come spring and summer. Here\u2019s a New York State of Mind on each team: They haven\u2019t won a title since 1973 and that anniversary only gets longer if not sadder. It\u2019s not like they never had a heartbeat since; the Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy teams each had a shot, and a few of those Carmelo Anthony teams were fun. Also: Linsanity! Yet, the Knicks over the last three decades have had too many false starts and stale lapses. They\u2019re under new management now, with Leon Rose running the operation and Tom Thibodeau on the bench, and if nothing else they lend hope and deserve a chance to succeed or fail. It\u2019s just that prosperity seems distant, given where they are and how much further they need to go. The Knicks not only lack a superstar, there\u2019s no intriguing young talent on the roster \u2014 no LaMelo Ball or Luka Doncic or Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell.Too many poor drafts prevented that, and when they did make the right decision, Kristaps Porzingis was traded, at his request, for cap space that couldn\u2019t entice a free agent superstar. Over the last 20 years, the Knicks have never had a first-team All-NBA selection or Rookie of the Year. That talent drain is the reason they\u2019ve missed the playoffs seven straight years. What\u2019s troublesome is how the Knicks weren\u2019t on the radar of great free agents. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard never gave the Knicks an interview, and players who forced their way out of teams \u2014 Anthony Davis among others \u2014 never forced their way to the Knicks. Anthony was a rare exception, and even that was botched; the Knicks traded assets to get him just three months before he became an unrestricted free agent and therefore risked nothing in return. Durant said the Knicks were no longer \u201ccool\u201d and that has the ring of truth if only because glamour bypassed them for such places as Miami, Golden State and of course L.A. After signing with the Knicks, guard Austin Rivers was shocked by this, saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re a real hooper, if you like playing on the biggest stage, this is it.\u201d True, and yet market size is outdated because endorsement power can be found in middle and smaller markets, mainly because of social media and a more viral world than 30 years ago. Plus, the makeup of New York isn\u2019t for everyone; for example, the Knicks\u2019 practice facility is deep in the suburbs while Madison Square Garden is in the middle of Manhattan, and toggling between those places isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Anyway: The focus is on the present and how the Knicks can polish themselves as a franchise and earn respect league-wide. That doesn\u2019t happen until the Knicks create reasonable track record for making the right decision on personnel. And that\u2019ll require at least a few more drafts and trades and free agent signings. After a 5-2 start, they\u2019ve lost three straight games and never broke 90 points in all three. The good news: Julius Randle is having a strong start, averaging 22.1 points, 11.2 rebounds and an impressive 6.9 assists from the power forward spot. Best of all, he\u2019s increasing his value, either to keep or trade. The Knicks would love to see the same growth from RJ Barrett, their top pick from two years ago, but the results are mixed so far. The Knicks have big expectations for Obi Toppin, their first rounder this year, but the injured rookie has only played one game. Mitchell Robinson brings an athletic presence at center and he\u2019s just 22, but his pure skills are still under construction. \u201cWe have to continue to build in the right direction,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have four or five All-Stars on this team. We don\u2019t have superstars on this team. But we have talented young players and you never know what can become on this team. Everything is headed in the right direction. We\u2019re building to be a part of something special. So we got to make this attractive.\u201d Given where they were four years ago, trapped in the ruins from the regrettable Celtics trade, the Nets emerged far better than expected and enhanced themselves enough to get the approval of Durant and Irving, who signed up two summers ago. That was a masterstroke, even if Durant missed all of last season while recovering from Achilles surgery and Irving played just 20 games because of injury. With both players healthy and showing the same impact as before \u2014 they\u2019re averaging a combined 57 points, 13.1 rebounds and 11.9 assists \u2014 the stage, therefore, was set for a breakout 2020-21 season, which still may happen. Right now though, Irving has been out since Jan. 7 because of a personal matter and the league is investigating footage of him at a party without a mask. The public is left to wonder if this is more of the same from Irving, an amazing talent but a perplexing individual who makes odd statements and was polarizing at his last stop with the Celtics. Can the Nets trust Irving in the long haul, that his distractions will be few or nonexistent once he returns from his absence? Obviously there\u2019s much at stake for a team with twin franchise players and championship dreams. If one of their stars creates friction or drama, that can have a domino effect in the locker room \u2014 and the biggest fear is how it\u2019ll go over with Durant. Durant is saying all the right things publicly, but he hitched his decision to sign with Brooklyn on Irving; the two were a package deal. Durant could\u2019ve gone anywhere in 2019 and instantly made a contending team better. Instead, he connected with Irving, who brings a strange history; he could no longer deal with being teammates with LeBron James after winning a title, and his leadership in Boston was found to be faulty in the Boston locker room. Even if normalcy returns for Irving and the Nets, the franchise faces a tough task in New York, where Knick blood runs deep. Although Brooklyn has clearly embraced the Nets, the fan affection by all accounts doesn\u2019t cross the East River. Besides Durant and Irving, the Nets are stocked with solid talent even if they lost Spencer Dinwiddie for the year with a knee injury. All of the important elements are there: shooting, interior defense, deep bench. That\u2019s another reason Durant chose Brooklyn; the Nets had all the necessary pieces to surround him with. The Knicks didn\u2019t. Therefore, Durant said he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthe savior of the Knicks\u201d and wanted Brooklyn so he could \u201cchill \u2026 and just focus on basketball.\u201d Well, clearly, it\u2019s not just basketball when Irving is involved, at least at the moment. This is a twist in New York, where controversy in the past was mainly confined to the Garden: James Dolan and Charles Oakley, Phil Jackson and Porzingis, etc. So this is a welcome switch for the Knicks. Come Wednesday, for one night anyway, the Knicks and Nets will be on the same level, two teams looking to avoid their seventh loss and hoping for momentum. They\u2019re doing their part to make New York notice; they\u2019re just taking different routes to sit on top of the heap. \u201cNeither team has won a championship in quite some time,\u201d Rivers said. \u201c\u2026 obviously, we\u2019re trying to build something here and they think they have a chance this year.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Never before in league history have a bunch of eager young prospects had to get off the court prematurely and sit around for months while dealing with COVID-19 concerns and the widespread virus shutdowns. Never before have they had to wait until November to hear their names called in the Draft , and then only in remote fashion. It was nice to see them gathered with family and friends, all of their reactions caught on video at the moment of selection. Still, walking onto that stage at Barclays Center to shake the commissioner\u2019s hand is what they dreamed about, not parking on their couch. And never before has a class of rookies been thrown almost immediately into the fray of veterans training camp, preseason games and actual NBA duty, all coming in a rush of barely a month. What typically is a relatively leisurely (and challenging enough) runway to a rookie\u2019s season \u2014 workouts in his new town, the baptism of the Las Vegas Summer League, two more months to adjust to professional life both on and off the court, followed by a month of camp and preseason \u2014 got scrunched into 34 days, Vegas scrapped entirely. And yet \u2026 Big dark cloud, meet undeniable silver lining: The Class of 2020 generally seems not at all fazed or set back by the wait-and-hurry-up circumstances of their pro plunges. Players picked near the top have shown their skills. And save for a few (such as Killian Hayes, Obi Toppin, Jalen Smith) who have been sidelined by injuries or virus protocols, no one has undercut the scouting reports that got them their gigs. This especially is worth noting when you consider the view of this year\u2019s rookie class before they were drafted, that they\u2019re role players and projects but not necessarily a consensus No. 1 guaranteed star. Some of the most exciting players and memorable performances in this herky-jerky, masked-up and mostly vacant-seat season have come from the new guys. So without further ado, here is our first installment of our weekly rankings. The Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Tuesday, Jan. 12) Season stats: 12.4 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 6.0 apg One of the best things anyone can say about a rookie is that he\u2019s affecting his team\u2019s ability to win. Look, lots of first-year players make mistakes that can cost a game here or there, and many don\u2019t log enough minutes to get credit or blame either way. But Ball has had a positive impact on the Hornets\u2019 6-5 start, a clear step up from last season\u2019s 23-42 mark. The 6-foot-8 point guard leads Charlotte in rebounding and player efficiency rating (19.5). He ranks right behind starter Devonte\u2019 Graham (6.5) in assists and grabbed attention by becoming the youngest player in NBA history to post a triple-double (22 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists against Atlanta last weekend). And while his flashy passing earns him spots on the highlight reels, it\u2019s his rebounding \u2014 instinctively blocking out bigger players and timing his leaps \u2014 that has been a consistent asset. The sense in Charlotte is that Ball is contributing plays of substance even when they\u2019re not stylish. Season stats: 10.9 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.5 bpg Nothing against Ball, but there were reasons Charlotte was talked about as considering a trade up to snag Wiseman. And if given the chance, would swap their rooks right now. Despite playing only three games in college and being off a competitive court for about a year, Wiseman has stepped into a serious operation in Golden State and provided instant value. The glimpses of greatness are getting more frequent, whether he\u2019s facing, backing toward the basket or protecting the rim at a pace of 1.5 blocks nightly. There are league execs who will tell you already that, while Ball might wind up as this year\u2019s Rookie of the Year, the guy they\u2019d rather have five years from now is Wiseman. Season stats:  12.1 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 5.3 apg Haliburton showed up, fresh out of Iowa State, publicly talking about his goal to be this season\u2019s Rookie of the Year. That would make him tops among the Class of 2020, but the 6-foot-5 point guard already ranks among the best of Sacramento\u2019s bundle of young talent. His passing ability has delighted the Kings\u2019 coaches \u2014 his assists average is closer to Ball\u2019s than any other rookies are close to them. He fits nicely with De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield. And his 50% accuracy from the arc is eye-popping \u2014 he\u2019s taking nearly 60% of his shots from 3-point range and hitting half of them. Season stats: 13.6 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 2.0 apg Though hardly a consensus pick at No. 1 in the Draft, Edwards has shown much of the potential that got him to that perch. He\u2019s giving the Timberwolves some of what they need, as in scoring punch (he leads his classmates in that category) and visions of greatness based on his explosiveness and athletic ability. Other things the Wolves crave? Not so much. Edwards\u2019 shooting is shaky, he\u2019s not using his ability to attack the rim to also earn trips to the foul line and there\u2019s not much to note defensively. Maybe we should factor in that Minnesota hasn\u2019t started him yet. Season stats: 10.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 1.0 apg The deeper we get into the season, the more folks will point this out: Williams came off the bench for all 29 games he played at Florida State, yet has started every game he\u2019s played as a pro. Part of that is optics \u2014 the Bulls needed to demonstrate quickly what they liked so much about a freshman reserve to make him the No. 4 pick. But a bigger part is Williams\u2019 versatility, his capacity to plug on a bad team a variety of notable holes. He\u2019s a 3-and-D natural, it seems: Williams\u2019 3-point shooting has been toasty (45.8%), and even LeBron James complimented his defensive work. In another era, the 6-foot-8 forward might have been dismissed as a \u201c\u2019tweener,\u201d but today he\u2019s one of those position-less players GMs covet. Season stats: 10.5 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 2.2 apg Seizing opportunity \u2014 the way Maxey did scoring 39 points against Denver for a thin Sixers\u2019 roster \u2014 is essential for rookies. 7. Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics Season stats: 8.6 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 3.1 apg Pretty high rung for the lowest Draft selection (No. 26) on our ladder, but hitting game-winners (Jan. 6 vs. Miami) will do that 8. Deni Avdija, Washington Wizards Season stats: 7.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 2.2 apg Fitting in like an established player at age 20. 9. Cole Anthony, Orlando Magic Season stats: 9.5 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 3.1 apg Markelle Fultz\u2019s injury means more minutes, more challenges. 10. Saddiq Bey, Detroit Pistons Season stats: 10.6 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 0.9 apg Rebounder and deep threat sharing Detroit newbie spotlight with Isaiah Stewart. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Since Fox will face the league\u2019s seventh-worst defense against point guards, his price is a bit low here, and he hit value with ease. Dennis Schroder (LAL) vs. OKC: $5,900 Schroder could be in line for more work if the Lakers rest LeBron James or Anthony Davis in the second part of their back-to-back, but neither star player saw more than 30 minutes of run yesterday, so the Lakers may not choose to rest them. Patrick Beverley (LAC) vs. NOP: $4,000 The Pelicans are a tough matchup for just about every position, but Beverley may have more luck than usual tonight if New Orleans locks in on defending Kawhi Leonard or Paul George. His average of 19.8 FDPPG is right in the value range, too. Tim Hardaway Jr. (DAL) vs. CHA: $6,800 With most of the Mavericks\u2019 lineup sidelined, Hardaway Jr. should be in line for more usage, and he could be a strong pivot away from likely chalk in Luka Doncic. Donte DiVincenzo (MIL) vs. DET: $4,600 I\u2019ve been DiVincenzo\u2019s hype man this year, and he\u2019s in line for another solid performance against the Pistons, as they give up the 10th-most FDPPG to point guards. He\u2019s averaging 23.5 FDPPG, too, which is above the five-times value threshold. Gary Trent Jr. (POR) vs. SAC: $3,500 Malik Beasley (MIN) vs. MEM: $5,800 Beasley and the Wolves face the league\u2019s second-worst defense (and the slate\u2019s worst) against small forwards tonight. Kyle Anderson (MEM) vs. MIN: $5,400 Anderson has been thrust into a larger role due to the injuries to players around him, and his average FDPPG (29.6) points to value at this affordable price point. The T\u2019Wolves give up the 11th-most FDPPG to the position, too. Carmelo Anthony (POR) vs. SAC: $4,500 Anthony is tonight\u2019s obligatory Blazer. Portland is still tinkering with how to best allocate minutes, but Melo got a whopping 35 his last time out, and that kind of run would be dangerous in what should be a high-scoring game. Robert Covington (POR) vs. SAC: $4,800 Robert Covington has had a slow start to the season, but that\u2019s baked into his low-end price point, and he could be a decent contrarian option here. He played 34 minutes in Portland\u2019s last game, too, so they\u2019re willing to use him despite his underperformance. Jae Crowder (PHO) vs. ATL: $4,400 Crowder faces the league\u2019s second-worst defense against power forwards tonight. He and Dario Saric ($4,100) should both be decent cap-saving options against the Hawks. James Johnson (DAL) vs. CHA: $4,200 Here\u2019s a thought \u2014 the Mavericks are pressed for depth, and some players might be expecting a lot out of Kristaps Porzingis in his first game back. Perhaps too much. Since the Hornets give up the most points to opposing power forwards, you should at least think about using Johnson in a lineup or two, especially since Maxi Kleber won\u2019t play. Jonas Valanciunas (MEM) vs. MIN: $6,900 I like Valanciunas tonight, but the T\u2019Wolves are only giving up so many points to opposing centers because of how many games they had to play without Karl-Anthony Towns. Still, KAT is a bit banged up, and Valanciunas could be able to exploit that. Enes Kanter (POR) vs. SAC: $5,300 I\u2019ll end with two last Blazers and Kings. First, Kanter \u2014 he\u2019s seen his minutes tick down in recent games, but with the Blazers unwilling to give Jusuf Nurkic more than 30 minutes per game, Kanter could be a decent option off the bench. Especially because Nurkic is questionable \u2014 and because the Kings give up the third-most points to centers. Hassan Whiteside (SAC) vs. POR: $4,200 Lastly, Whiteside is in a revenge spot against the Blazers. He\u2019s yet to get much run for the Kings thus far, but he dropped 29.6 FD points against the Kings on Saturday.

But in the aftermath of a 117-100 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, the Houston Rockets star guard sounded off, expressing pessimism about his team\u2019s prospects for gelling this season as it fell to 3-6. \u201cI love this city,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI literally have done everything that I can. This situation is crazy. It\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think can be fixed. So, yeah. Thanks.\u201d With that, Harden immediately ended his postgame news conference on Zoom. But not before pointing out \u201cwe\u2019re just not good enough,\u201d as Houston struggled through its fourth loss in five outings in a game the Lakers won wire-to-wire and led by as many as 30 points. The setback marked the Rockets\u2019 second consecutive loss to the Lakers by a combined margin of 35 points. Harden hasn\u2019t scored more than 20 points in four straight outings, his longest such streak since 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close, honestly, to that team \u2014 obviously the defending champions \u2014 and to all the other elite teams out there,\u201d Harden said. \u201cYou can tell the difference in these last two games.

From the beginning of the game, they were just aggressive, veteran team, obviously, a championship team, and one of the best teams that we have in this league.\u201d One play in the second quarter perhaps illustrated Harden\u2019s hopelessness. Helplessly, Ben McLemore sprinted at LeBron James, as the Lakers star stood wide open in the corner. James pumped, gathered, then hoisted the shot, immediately spinning to face the Los Angeles bench . Swish . James never looked back to see whether the shot would fall, and metaphorically, the Lakers didn\u2019t either in crushing the Rockets. The Lakers scored a season-high 71 points in the first half on the way to their largest halftime lead of the season (23) with James pouring in 22 of his game-high 26 points. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel good. It sure doesn\u2019t,\u201d Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously a together group, and they were having fun at our expense. It doesn\u2019t feel good at all, and we should take umbrage. It\u2019s like they\u2019re dancing on our home court, and we\u2019ve just got to fight through it.\u201d They\u2019ll also need to find a way to push through the internal strife dogging the team. Harden showed up late to training camp , but he wasn\u2019t cleared to work out with the team until testing negative for COVID-19 on six consecutive days. That forced Harden to miss the team\u2019s first two preseason outings. Then the NBA postponed Houston\u2019s season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder because the Rockets lacked the minimum number of available players required to field a gameday roster due to coronavirus protocols. Houston would open the season against Portland with limited options after listing six players on the official injury list as out while they advanced through the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. The Rockets played their first two games \u2014 both losses \u2014 with just nine players available , one more than the league\u2019s minimum eight players required to play a game. Those situations no doubt slowed Houston\u2019s progress toward gaining cohesion with a first-year coach in Silas leading a roster filled with several new pieces in John Wall, Christian Wood and DeMarcus Cousins. Informed of Harden\u2019s criticism of the team, Wall initially declined to comment. But then \u2026 \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his own opinion,\u201d Wall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of basketball to be played. We\u2019ve only played nine games. Like I told everybody tonight, and I told the guys before: When the 1 through 15 guys all are on the same page, and committed, they know their roles, they know what they want to do, they know what they want to get out of this, that\u2019s to win, you all will be fine. \u201cBut when you have certain guys in the mix that don\u2019t want to buy in all in one, it\u2019s gonna be hard to do anything special, to do anything good as a basketball team. In my 11 years I\u2019ve been in the league, I\u2019ve been on teams like that my first five years where it was all about me, me, me, me, not about the team. And that hurts, and it brings everybody down. \u201cSo, if we can get all on the same page, we can be something good here. We can\u2019t dwell down on it because it\u2019s only been nine games. C\u2019mon man, you want to jump off the cliff off of nine games? There\u2019s a lot of basketball still to be played.\u201d The two losses to the Lakers certainly didn\u2019t inspire much confidence. By the start of the fourth quarter, Silas had already pulled all of Houston\u2019s starters. In fact, none of the top six in the Rockets\u2019 rotation played at all in the fourth quarter. Silas admitted to being \u201csurprised\u201d the Rockets seemed unable to make a run against the Lakers. \u201cThey hit us over the head early in both games, and we weren\u2019t able to respond,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we should be. We\u2019ve got to be a team that as adversity comes, you respond in a way that you will meet that adversity with force. We\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Silas stopped short of criticizing Houston\u2019s effort in Thursday\u2019s loss. Harden finished with 16 points on 5-of-16 shooting with six assists, while Wood contributed a team-high 18 points on 8 of 18 from the floor. No Rocket reached the 20-point mark for the first time since Dec. 6, 2018. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say there was a lack of fight or a lack of competitiveness,\u201d Silas said, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t bring the right intensity to the game. What we\u2019re trying to do with that first group is get them in the rhythm with getting the ball quickly, and we\u2019re not necessarily doing that, and making sure that we are on our defensive coverages, which we weren\u2019t.\u201d * * * Michael C.

( Note: All stats and records are from games played through Jan. 11, 2021.) Denver Nuggets (5-5) at Brooklyn Nets (5-6) 7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Nuggets opened the season losing four of their first five games, and not resembling the team that advanced to the Western Conference finals just a few months ago. But the new year has treated the Nuggets well as they enter Tuesday\u2019s game in Brooklyn having won four of their last five games. Nikola Jokic is the only player in the NBA averaging a triple-double through the season\u2019s first three weeks. He\u2019s 17th in points (24.4 ppg), eighth in rebounds (11.2 rpg) and second in assists (10.4 apg). The Nets enter Tuesday having lost back-to-back games for the third time in their first 11 games of 2020-21. Kevin Durant returned to the lineup on Sunday against OKC, but his 36-point, 11-rebound performance wasn\u2019t enough to hold off the Thunder. Through his first seven games in Brooklyn, Durant is averaging 29.3 ppg (2 nd in NBA) while shooting 51.6% overall and a career-best 42.5% on 3-pointers. The last time Durant scoring average was this high over the course of a season? His Kia MVP campaign of 2013-14, which is the same season he won his fourth and most recent scoring title (32.0 ppg). Kyrie Irving remains out of the lineup, so Brooklyn will be shorthanded as they look to avoid a three-game skid. Dallas Mavericks (5-4) at Charlotte Hornets (6-5) 7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass After missing the first nine games of the season, Kristaps Porzingis was set to make his 2020-21 season debut on Monday before the Mavs-Pelicans game was postponed. That means our first glimpse of \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d this season will come on NBA League Pass when the Mavs take on the Hornets. The Mavs went 5-4 without Porzingis in the lineup, but his return should open things up even more for Luka Doncic, who has recorded triple-doubles in two of the three games of Dallas\u2019 win streak entering the week. With a 109-88 win over New York on Monday, the Hornets have won four straight games \u2014 their longest win streak since April 3-9 in 2019). This game features a clash of two exciting young playmakers in Doncic and rookie Hornets rookie LaMelo Ball. On Saturday, Ball became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double (19 years, 190 days) and has averaged 13.8 ppg, 11.0 rpg and 8.0 apg during the win streak . Gordon Hayward, Charlotte\u2019s offseason free-agent acquisition, is hot as well, averaging 29.3 ppg on 55.4% shooting (50% on 3-pointers) and 92.3% on free throws during the win streak. Indiana Pacers (6-4) at Portland Trail Blazers (6-4)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass  The Pacers and Blazers are 6-4 through 10 games, but while the Blazers have won three in a row entering Tuesday, the Pacers have lost back-to-back games for the first time all season. Portland\u2019s third straight win came on Monday thanks to CJ McCollum\u2019s second game-winning shot of the season . McCollum leads the Blazers in scoring at 28.1 ppg (3rd in NBA), his 47.8% shooting is the second-best mark of his career and his 44.5% mark on 3-pointers is a career-best. He\u2019s also made a league-leading 49 3-pointers so far this season. The Pacers are one of two teams \u2014 along with the Houston Rockets \u2014 to have three players averaging at least 20 points per game. For the Pacers, that trio is leading scorer Malcolm Brogdon (23.5 ppg), Domantas Sabonis (22.2 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 5.8 apg) and Victor Oladipo (20.0 ppg). Sabonis is also one of only four players to average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in 2020-21 (reigning two-time Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only player to accomplish that feat last season). Golden State Warriors (6-4) at Phoenix Suns (7-4) 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass  There are only three active players in the NBA that have scored at least 62 points in a game \u2014 and two will meet in this game as Stephen Curry (62 points on Jan. 3, 2021) and the Warriors take on Devin Booker (70 points on March 24, 2017) and the Suns. (How many of you knew that Carmelo Anthony \u2014 62 points on Jan. 24, 2014 \u2014 had the other 62-point game before clicking the link above?) Curry and Booker can explode offensively at any time, so keeping an eye on their games on League Pass is a must. Curry is tied for second with five 30+ point games in 10 games played so far this season. However, in two of his last three outings he has been held under 15 points and shot a combined 2-for-16 on 3-pointers. Will he be able to get loose against a Suns defense that allows the third-fewest 3-pointers made per game this season? Booker has scored at least 20 points in seven straight games and has been held below 20 points only once this season. Playing alongside Chris Paul, Booker\u2019s usage rate (28.7%) is at its lowest since his sophomore season back in 2016-17, but his effective field goal percentage (54.9%) is a career best . The Suns entered 2020-21 riding the momentum of their 8-0 Orlando bubble run and, despite a loss in Washington on Monday, they\u2019re the No. 3 seed in the West. Utah Jazz (6-4) at Denver Nuggets (5-5) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass  We highlighted this game in our League Pass watch guide for the first half of the season as it marks the first 2020-21 meeting between Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray since last season\u2019s playoff duel. After trading shots for seven games in last season\u2019s opening round \u2014 and setting the record with 475 combined points by opponents in a playoff series \u2014 will this rivalry pick up where it left off?"},{"id":474075,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-nbpa-update-health-and-safety-protocols","date":"2021-01-12","title":"NBA, NBPA agree to additional measures to supplement Health and Safety protocols","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) today announced an agreement on additional measures to supplement the current Health and Safety Protocols governing the 2020-21 season.

Those developments came as the NBA\u2019s board of governors was to meet and evaluate the situation around the league and determine what steps \u2014 likely stiffening some parts of the protocols \u2014 to take in an effort to keep the season going. The league has now postponed four games since Sunday because of the virus situation among some teams. The Magic are also supposed to play the Celtics on Friday in Boston; no determination about that game has been announced. The Celtics have eight players listed as out right now because of the league\u2019s protocols, and have now seen three of their games postponed this week alone. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to follow what the NBA\u201d says, Washington coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re the experts. They have all the medical, they have all the science, they have everything, all the data. \u2026 I\u2019m for whatever the NBA wants us to do.\u201d Among the actions that the NBA is working with the National Basketball Players Association to implement, according to two people familiar with the league\u2019s plan: urging players to stop in-game and postgame handshakes and hugs, additional mask-wearing rules especially in the bench areas, and mandates that would temporarily allow players in their home markets to only go to practices, games, workouts and tend to essential matters. The people spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the union had announced those measures. The Wizards canceled their Tuesday practice, saying that decision was made \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d They beat the Phoenix Suns on Monday night, and are scheduled to play host to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. The Wizards did not identify the two players. Based on the most recent information released by teams, though the numbers can change quickly, it seems at least 36 players in the NBA entering Tuesday are dealing with some sort of virus-related issue. Those issues include players having to sit because contact-tracing data showed they may have been exposed to someone who may be positive for COVID-19. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot with COVID,\u201d Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said after his depleted team lost in Atlanta on Monday night. \u201cNot a lot we can do with it. I have a sneaking feeling that there\u2019s going to be a lot of teams with this problem.\u201d Miami was preparing to play in Philadelphia on Tuesday without eight players because of virus-related issues and subsequent contact tracing, a problem for the Heat that presented itself after they played in Washington on Saturday night. Boston\u2019s game in Chicago on Tuesday was called off because of virus concerns, as was the Dallas-New Orleans game on Monday and the Heat-Celtics matchup in Boston on Sunday. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver warned before the season that issues playing amid a pandemic would be \u201cinevitable,\u201d but the league has also said in recent days that pausing play is not currently something under consideration. The league said on Thursday that, for testing during the preceding seven days, four players out of 498 in the league had new positive tests.

Sabonis, Indiana\u2019s still-developing All-Star power forward, has sizzled during the Pacers\u2019 first ten games. With a points\/rebounds double-double in each \u2014 including one triple-double and a 20-20 game against Phoenix over the weekend \u2014 the 6-foot-11 scion of Lithuanian legend Arvydas Sabonis is averaging 22.2 point, 12.4 rebounds and 5.8 assists heading into Tuesday night\u2019s game at Golden State. All of which is a vast improvement over the 0.0 across the board Sabonis posted in the Orlando restart last summer. A painful bout of plantar fasciitis in his left foot wiped out Indiana\u2019s eight seeding games for him, followed by its first-round series against Miami that whizzed by in a sweep. Painful met painful, as Sabonis \u2014 who had injured the foot when he and teammates assembled for some pre-restart scrimmages \u2014 left the bubble to see a specialist, felt some improvement, quarantined back in, then didn\u2019t get the Game 6 or Game 7 he felt might have bought him the time to get on the court. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it was tough,\u201d Sabonis told NBA.com after a walk-through in Sacramento Monday. \u201cEspecially during that quarantine time when we were all working out, trying to get in shape, prior to training camp actually. I found out about the plantar fascia a week before the season was about to start. You play all year round to make the playoffs, and to miss that was tough.\u201d What we\u2019ve seen over the past three weeks then has been Sabonis unleashed. Here was a guy, the lone All-Star from a perennial playoff team, and he was as impatient to play again as anyone on the long-layoff clubs not invited to the bubble. \u201cI hadn\u2019t played since March,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cSince all the teams that missed the bubble, it was almost a year, you know, so. This is the sport we love, so being able to come out and play, it was awesome. Even the preseason games, I was excited to be out there with some real referees.\u201d He even missed the refs? Wow, that\u2019s how much Sabonis wanted back. Under new Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren and his staff, Sabonis isn\u2019t just back, he\u2019s better. His dribble-handoff and pick-and-roll abilities are crisper, quicker, with more room to roam now that Indiana\u2019s floor is more deeply spaced. He is the hub of all they do offensively, screening, passing, posting up or creating opportunities for himself with a couple of baseline dribbles. Defensively, Sabonis \u2014 at 240 pounds \u2014 is in charge of glomming onto missed shots while cohort Myles Turner deflects or discourages them. Sabonis can deliver the contact at one end of the floor and absorb it at the other. It showed Saturday against Phoenix, the Pacers\u2019 final home game before their current five-game Western Conference trip. Coping with the Suns\u2019 Deandre Ayton, Sabonis caught fire in the third quarter on his way to 28 points and 22 rebounds, the first 20-20 game by an Indiana player since Troy Murphy in 2008. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong dude,\u201d Suns analyst and former NBA guard Eddie Johnson said during the broadcast. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to overpower you in the air. He\u2019s just going to beat you up on the floor. You have to be ready for him, you have to fight him. He\u2019s having his way. From a physicality standpoint, somebody\u2019s going to have to do something here.\u201d Phoenix eventually fended off Sabonis and his team, pulling away thanks to Mikal Bridges and Devin Booker\u2019s combined 59 points. Still, Sabonis\u2019 roll continued with the ninth of what now is 10-for-10 in double-doubles. He had 50 of them in 62 appearances last season. \u201cFor those who had a great opportunity to see his dad play, Arvydas Sabonis, you have to understand where this kid gets all his fun,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe is simply unguardable at times. And his dad was unguardable. The footwork he is showing in this second half, y\u2019know, he\u2019s pretty much destroying the Suns\u2019 interior defense.\u201d Sure enough, footwork was one of the things Sabonis labored to improve in the extended time he had between his seasons. This work can be seen in the better balance he displays while seeking and taking shots. He is making 56.4% of his shots, including 40.9% from behind the arc. Most noticeably, Sabonis is averaging 2.2 3-point attempts, on pace for 158. That\u2019s in line with the 159 he launched prematurely as a 20-year-old rookie with OKC in 2016-17, and a clear upgrade to the 121 he\u2019s taken in the past three seasons combined. Credit Bjorkgren for much of that, directly and indirectly. The Pacers have joined the rest of the NBA \u2014 they\u2019re averaging 34 3-pointers so far, up from 28 per game in 2019-20. That\u2019s a bump from last place to 18th. Sabonis took nearly 19% of his shots last season as 2-pointers from 10 feet out to the 3-point line. This year, less than 8%. There still is work to be done. Sabonis can get targeted defensively and look adrift against smaller, shiftier opponents. He is tied for 10th in turnovers (36), though the names all around him in that category \u2014 Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 are elite company. His free throw attempts are up (5.5 nightly) but his accuracy isn\u2019t. At 67.3%, it\u2019s his first time below 70% since his rookie season. The Pacers need those, too, getting outscored by 2.9 per game from the line. And yet few are nit-picking in Indianapolis, given Sabonis\u2019 play overall. Especially when factoring in his workload, 37.8 minutes that ranks second in the NBA behind New York\u2019s R.J. Barrett at 37.9. Bjorkgren has been leaning heavily on his talented big man and point guard Malcolm Brogdon (37.5 minutes). Though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s sustainable \u2014 this trip has the Pacers playing five games in seven nights bouncing up and down the West Coast \u2014 the temptation is understandable. Bjorkgren praised Sabonis liberally after their first few games together. \u201cHe\u2019ll be patient, he\u2019ll wait for cutters, he\u2019ll wait for the open man to present himself,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s on that block, not only can he score but he\u2019s a trigger man and he can make plays.\u201d It\u2019s challenging with a rotating cast of available teammates. Indiana has been beset by injuries again, notably to bubble breakout star T.J. Warren, Jeremy Lamb and Goga Bitadze. Last season, 13 players \u2014 including Victor Oladipo, Brogdon and Sabonis \u2014 missed a combined 190 games, and former coach Nate McMillan used 22 different starting lineups to steer the Pacers to a 45-28 record and No. 4 seed. Since Sabonis has been on both sides, he had no problem expressing a preference. Harder to be hurt or harder to soldier on without his mates? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely harder being hurt,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cIf you can\u2019t play ball, the sport you love, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on. Seeing your teammates out there without you, you know you can\u2019t help and be there for them.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

With his first make from beyond the arc against the Blazers, Lowry passed renowned shooter Dale Ellis for sole possession of 22nd place on the all-time 3-point makes list with 1,720. Lowry passed Ellis with a 3-pointer from the left wing with 6:24 left in the first quarter.

Former Sacramento Kings star Peja Stojakovic is next on the list with 1,760 career 3-pointers. Lowry hasn\u2019t averaged fewer than two 3s a game since the 2014-15 campaign, and has finished in the league\u2019s top 10 in makes from distance in three different seasons. The 24th pick in the 2006 draft by Memphis, Lowry was later traded to Houston and Toronto.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. Tyrese Maxey (SG \u2013 PHI): 20% rostered In his lone start last week, Maxey amassed 39 points, three three-pointers, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals in 43.8 minutes. Keep in mind that Ben Simmons, Shake Milton, Joel Embiid and Seth Curry did not play but he should see a ton of playing time this week (the 76ers play five games). Justin Holiday (SG\/SF \u2013 IND): 31% rostered Since TJ Warren went down with an injury, Holiday has averaged 31.3 minutes, 13 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 2.6 3-pointers over five games. The Pacers play five games this week so scoop him up and get him into your lineups. Doug McDermott (SF\/PF \u2013 IND): 5% rostered McDermott tweaked his ankle a few games ago but looks to be fine now as he played 23.3 minutes in his last outing. McDermott is a scorer and 3-point specialist who won\u2019t contribute much in the other categories. With that said, five games are five games. Aaron Holiday (PG \u2013 IND): 2% rostered Holiday has barely been a top 300 player for fantasy, yet he\u2019s averaged 24 minutes over the past three games and he plays five games this week. Holiday has a paltry usage rate of 11 over the past three games and he\u2019s shooting 31% overall, so don\u2019t expect many points. He can deliver some 3-pointers and steals. Cam Reddish (SF\/PF \u2013 ATL): 47% rostered The Hawks play four games this week and Bogdan Bogdanovic is expected to miss some time due to injury, so Reddish could see tons of action. Over the past three games, he\u2019s averaged 30.4 minutes per game, 13 points, two 3-pointers, 4.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.7 steals. The efficiency has been awful at 30%, though, but the usage rate has been at 24.3. Payton Pritchard (PG \u2013 BOS): 17% rostered The Celtics play four games this week and are currently ravaged due to health and safety protocols. As a result, Pritchard should see elevated playing time and could soak up some of the usage vacated by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Over the past four games, Pritchard was already averaging 25.9 minutes, 11.3 points, 1.5 3-pointers, 3.5 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The usage rate has been 17.7 while the efficiency has been a sparkling 48% from the field. Tacko Fall (C \u2013 BOS): 3% rostered The Celtics\u2019 frontcourt has been ravaged, leaving Daniel Theis and Fall as the last men standing. In his last game, Fall played 19 minutes and contributed four points, eight rebounds and three blocks. The usage rate is sub-10%, but at 7-foot-5 he\u2019ll get you rebounds and blocks. However, he may not play much against teams like the Heat with Bam Adebayo \u2014 who operates from the perimeter \u2014 pulling Fall away from the basket. Bismack Biyombo (C \u2013 CHA): 23% rostered The minutes have decreased over the past week, but Biyombo is still starting and playing 24 minutes per game. Biyombo will provide rebounds and blocks, but the free throw shooting is bad. Cedi Osman (SF\/PF \u2013 CLE): 18% rostered The Cavaliers play four games this week. Over the past four games, Osman has played 35 mpg, as both Darius Garland and Collin Sexton have been injured. He\u2019s contributed 11.8 points, 2.3 3-pointers, 5.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.5 steals. The shooting has been awful, though, at 29% from the field and 66% from the line. When Garland and Sexton return, his playing time and usage will plummet. Tyus Jones (PG \u2013 MEM): 20% rostered The Grizzlies play four games this week. Jones has filled in for the injured Ja Morant and averaged 29 minutes per game in six starts. The usage rate is low so don\u2019t expect points, but assists and steals should be abundant. Josh Hart (SG\/SF \u2013 NO): 23% rostered The Pelicans play four games this week. Once in a while, Hart will pop off for some points, as evidenced by the 19 he scored last game. It doesn\u2019t happen often, though. What he does provide are good rebound numbers with a sprinkle of steals and 3-pointers. Austin Rivers (PG\/SG \u2013 NYK): 27% rostered The Knicks play four games this week and over the past three games, Rivers has averaged 32.6 minutes per game. He\u2019s averaging 14.3 points, three 3-pointers, 3.3 rebounds, three assists and one steal per game while shooting 53% from the field. Dare I say that he\u2019s a must pick up? George Hill (PG\/SG \u2013 OKC): 25% rostered The Thunder play four games this week. Hill isn\u2019t sexy, but he\u2019s averaging 25 minutes per game and can provide some 3-pointers, assists and steals. He\u2019s on a bit of a cold streak lately, but is still shooting 49% from the field on the season. Luguentz Dort (SG\/SF \u2013 OKC): 30% rostered Dort is averaging 28 minutes per game and can contribute steals, 3-pointers and rebounds. Cole Anthony (PG \u2013 ORL): 44% rostered He\u2019s starting in place of Markelle Fultz and can provide a few dimes, but the shooting efficiency is worse than awful. On the season, he\u2019s converting 31% of his attempts. Cameron Johnson (SF\/PF \u2013 PHO): 34% rostered The Suns play four games this week. Over the past three games, Johnson has averaged 26.7 minutes per game and is a top 75 player on a per-game basis. The usage rate is a healthy 20 and he\u2019s hoisting up 10.7 shots per game. This has translated to 14 points per game and 3.3 3-pointers. He has also provided four rebounds and one block per game. Derrick Jones Jr. (SG\/SF \u2013 POR): 6% rostered The Trail Blazers play four games this week. Jones starts and is averaging 28 mpg on the season. Over the past three games, though, that number has ticked down to 23.6. Jones won\u2019t score much, but will grab some boards and provide defensive stats. Gary Trent Jr. (SF\/SF \u2013 POR): 12% rostered Strictly a points and 3-pointers streamer. The efficiency fluctuates but he can get hot on any night. Deni Avdija (SG\/SF \u2013 WAS): 18% rostered Avdija has started all ten games this season but hadn\u2019t done much until last outing when he poured in 20 points, five 3-pointers, five rebounds, five assists and two steals in 31.6 minutes. Keep in mind that Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal didn\u2019t play in that game while Thomas Bryant went down with an injury. With that said, the Wizards play four games this week. Robin Lopez (C \u2013 WAS): 3% rostered  Moritz Wagner (PF\/C \u2013 WAS): 6% rostered Thomas Bryant is done for the season after tearing his ACL. Lopez played 21 minutes while Wagner played 20 minutes after Bryant went down. Lopez will provide rebounds and blocks while Wagner will contribute rebounds and three-pointers."},{"id":473447,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-monday-jan-11","date":"2021-01-11","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Monday (Jan. 11)","content":"Tyrese Haliburton (SAC) vs. IND: $5,400 Haliburton should be on your radar every night in DFS contests, as his price has still not caught up to his on-the-court production. Across his last three, the rookie has averaged a healthy 14.7 points, 7.3 assists, 3.7 boards and two steals. He remains a bargain for tonight\u2019s slate. Tyrese Maxey (PHI) vs. ATL: $5,200 With a litany of 76ers out due to health and safety protocols, Maxey stepped up for a monster game Saturday, delivering 39 points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals for 60.4 FD points. At least five players will be out again Monday, leaving the door open for Maxey to shine once again. I\u2019ll gladly pay the $5.2K price tag needed to roster him tonight. De\u2019Andre Hunter (ATL) vs. PHI: $6,300 Hunter has amassed at least 30 FD points in each of his last five games, averaging 20.0 points and 6.6 rebounds in that span. His price has crept up to $6.3K, but Hunter remains a value even at the salary. Davis Bertans (WAS) vs. PHO: $4,600 Bertans should see additional run in the frontcourt with Thomas Bryant (ACL) out of action, and he\u2019s got an excellent matchup. Phoenix has allowed the fifth-most threes per game (14.9) this season, including the most (18.0) across the last three games. That bodes well for the sharp-shooting specialist, Bertans, who comes in at a friendly $4.6K. Bismack Biyombo (CHA) vs. NY: $4,700 Biyombo continues to start for Charlotte, and he\u2019s averaging 26.8 minutes per contest, his most since 2012. The Hornets\u2019 big man finds himself in a favorable spot against the league\u2019s worst defense at stopping opposing centers. Moritz Wagner (WAS) vs. PHO: $4,000 With Thomas Bryant (ACL) out of action, Wagner is expected to see an uptick in minutes moving forward. He went for 13\/7 across a season-high 19 minutes Sunday, and while his playing time will be tough to predict night-to-night while sharing time with Robin Lopez, Wagner has shown the ability to score and rebound productively in limited playing time. He\u2019s worth a shot in GPPs on Monday.

We saw COVID-related absences (some positive tests, some contact-tracing quarantines) all across the league, affecting both the schedule and the quality of play. Kevin Durant missed three games and Bradley Beal had to isolate over the weekend. The Mavs had to leave three guys in Denver and the Sixers had just seven healthy players on Saturday, starting two rookies that you probably never heard of.

The Hawks announced Sunday that MRI found Bogdanovic sustained an avulsion fracture the previous night when he went down awkwardly in a loss to Charlotte. Soft tissue inflammation and a bone bruise also was diagnosed. According to the Mayo Clinic, an avulsion fracture is when a small chunk of bone attached to a tendon or ligament gets pulled away from the main part of the bone. In most cases, it is treated with icing and rest, followed by controlled exercises to strengthen the knee and improve the range of motion. Surgery can be required in more serious cases, which would lengthen the recovery period. The Hawks have not determined how long Bogdanovic will be out. His treatment plan was being reviewed and will be updated later in the week. Bogdanovic was one of the major offseason acquisitions for the rebuilding Hawks, signing a four-year, $72 million contract in free agency. He was averaging 9.9 points a game while shooting 36.2% from 3-point range. The Hawks have been hit by a rash of injuries and are mired in a four-game losing streak after starting the season 4-1. The team is also without forward Danilo Gallinari (right ankle sprain), point guard Rajon Rondo (right knee injury maintenance), guard Kris Dunn (right ankle surgery) and top draft pick Onyeka Okongwu (left foot inflammation).

Marcus Smart (BOS) vs. MIA: $6,300 With Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker, and Jaylen Brown all potentially missing this game, Smart could be playing 40 minutes and handling the ball a ton. Norman Powell (TOR) at GS: $5,000 Powell just had his best game of the season and should continue that success against one of the worst defenses in the NBA. LeBron James (LAL) at HOU: $10,400 LBJ will also be in the studs section in this supreme matchup. Kevin Durant (BKN) vs. OKC: $9,900 KD should be back for this game and he\u2019ll definitely be hungry against his former team. We really like him if Irving is out too. Kelly Oubre (GSW) vs. TOR: $5,300 Oubre has been turning his season around recently, scoring at least 30 FD points in four of their last six games. LaMarcus Aldridge (SAN) at MIN: $6,500 LA just had his best game of the season on Friday and he should be able to continue that success against a Wolves team with the worst defensive efficiency in the NBA. Daniel Theis (BOS) vs. MIA: $5,700 Theis could be playing huge minutes with half of the Celtics roster dealing with COVID protocols and that alone makes him hard to fade. Draymond Green (GS) vs. TOR: $5,100 Green has really been struggling but it\u2019s just a matter of time before he has a monster game at this dirt-cheap price tag. Nikola Jokic (DEN) at NYK: $11,500 Jokic is a monster and he\u2019ll be in the studs section, obviously. Jarrett Allen (BKN) vs. OKC: $7,400 Allen has started the last three games for the Nets, averaging over 40 FD points per game across his last four fixtures. Mitchell Robinson (NYK) vs. DEN: $6,200 Robinson is playing a career-high in minutes and if he continues to play 30-plus minutes a night, Mitch Rob could be an $8,000 player with his per-minute production.

He became only the fifth rookie in NBA history to record a triple-double and the first Hornets player to do it coming off the bench.

It\u2019s like he\u2019s been doing this for a number of years,\u201d Borrego said of Ball, who played overseas before becoming the third pick in the NBA draft. Ball had several sharp passes, including a perfect behind-the-back strike to set up a 3-pointer by P.J. Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming. He might throw it behind his head, behind his back or straight to you,\u201d joked Washington, who also had 22 points and was on the receiving end of several of Ball\u2019s passes. \u201cYou have to be active and aware when he has the ball.

Caris LeVert (BKN) vs. MEM: 6,800 In two games without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, LeVert has averaged just shy of 56 FD points per contest. He\u2019s sure to be a chalky option, but this is a case where you don\u2019t want to fade the chalk. It could burn you. Tyrese Haliburton (SAC) vs. TOR: 5,400 Haliburton is coming off a massive game where he went for 17 points, seven rebounds, six assists, and three steals. With De\u2019Aaron Fox (hamstring injury) a game-time decision due, the rookie could be in line for a lot of minutes. That gives him plenty of opportunity to build on Wednesday\u2019s season-best showing. Kelly Oubre (GS) vs. LAC: 5,300 Oubre\u2019s season has been up-and-down, but he\u2019s crossed the 30-FD point plateau four times across eight games. Stephen Curry is a game-time decision tonight, and if he\u2019s out or limited, Oubre should take on a more prominent role on offense. His matchup with the Clippers boasts a 232.5 over\/under, one of the highest on the slate. Otto Porter (CHI) vs. LAL: 5,600 With Lauri Markkanen out again, I\u2019ll continue to roll with Porter. Porter posted a 14.7-point dud Wednesday, but prior to that, he had averaged 35.5 FD points across four games. The salary is too good to pass up given his upside. Marvin Bagley (SAC) vs. TOR: 5,800 Bagley\u2019s 24-point, 12-rebound effort Wednesday is what we\u2019ve been waiting to see, as he erupted for 45.4 FD points. Richaun Holmes is a game-time decision tonight with an ankle injury, and Bagley should be a primary option in Sacramento\u2019s frontcourt. The potential absence of Fox opens the door for more offensive opportunities for Bagley as well. Steven Adams (NO) vs. CHA: 6,500 Adams recorded his first career triple-double Wednesday, and while double-digit assists aren\u2019t something to get accustomed to, Adams\u2019 consistent work on the boards and on defense give him a stable floor. Charlotte has been one of the best matchups for opposing centers this season, and Adams is worth a look here. DeMarcus Cousins (HOU) vs. ORL: 5,300 Cousins \u201cboogied\u201d to 44.3 FD points Wednesday with Christian Wood out of action, and Wood is a game-time decision tonight. There\u2019s a lot of value to be had at just $5.3K. Brook Lopez (MIL) vs. UTA: 4,700 I don\u2019t mind rolling the dice on Lopez tonight at just $4.7K. He\u2019s coming off a season-best 35.3 points against Detroit on Wednesday, and he\u2019s got a great chance to keep the momentum rolling against Utah. The Jazz\/Bucks game has the highest over\/under of the evening at 236.5, and I\u2019d like to get in on the action with this very affordable price tag.

The top eight teams will advance to a single-elimination playoff. \u201cWe worked closely with our teams, the Basketball Players Union, and public health experts to develop a structure that allows our teams to gather at a single site and safely play,\u201d said NBA G League President Shareef Abdur-Rahim. \u201cWe are thrilled to get back to basketball and to fulfill our mission as a critical resource for the NBA in developing players, coaches, referees, athletic trainers and front-office staff.\u201d NBA teams without an NBA G League affiliate participating in Orlando will have the opportunity to assign roster players and transfer Two-Way players using the league\u2019s flexible assignment and Two-Way rules. The full list of the 17 participating NBA G League teams is below. \u201cOur Cast Members are eager to work with the NBA family again and welcome in the next round of talented basketball players to compete at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex,\u201d said Faron Kelley, vice president of Disney Sports. \u201cMost importantly, Disney and the NBA G League will continue our shared focus on the necessary safety protocols for the well-being of the players, coaches, staff and everyone supporting this event.\u201d Ignite, the recently launched team for elite NBA Draft-eligible players coached by former NBA player and head coach Brian Shaw, will play its first games against NBA G League competition in Orlando. Different from a traditional season, Ignite will be eligible to advance to the playoffs at Walt Disney World Resort due to the unique circumstances of this year. Players, coaches, team and league staff living on the NBA G League\u2019s campus at Walt Disney World Resort will be guided by comprehensive leaguewide health and safety protocols, which are based on the core principles of social distancing, mask wearing, hand hygiene and COVID-19 testing. The NBA G League heads to ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Disney just a few months after the NBA successfully restarted the 2019-20 NBA regular season at that venue last summer, which culminated with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the NBA title. The complete 2021 NBA G League game and broadcast schedule will be announced at a later date. The 17 participating NBA G League teams are: The Grand Rapids Drive announced they are opting out of the 2020-21 season, which would have been the team\u2019s final year as an affiliate of the Detroit Pistons (which followed the Pistons\u2019 recent purchase of Phoenix\u2019s G League franchise last year). The Drive will now turn their attention to the 2021-22 season, which is expected to include a new affiliate announcement. Additionally, the Maine Red Claws will not participate in the 2020-21 season because the team\u2019s parent club, the Boston Celtics, have opted out of that scenario. The Sioux Falls Skyforce, the G League affiliate of the Miami Heat, have also opted out of the 2020-21 season."},{"id":471769,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-jan-8-2021-edition","date":"2021-01-08","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: LeBron James starts at the top as new chase begins","content":"In theory alone, the inevitable reshuffling of the Kia MVP chessboard makes sense at the start of a new season. Change, of some sort, is on the way. Good luck convincing the ruling class of such things. For every ambitious newcomer to the conversation, there is an incumbent refusing to abdicate their position. So even when the oddsmakers cast Luka Doncic as the favorite to ascend to the top of the MVP heap in his third NBA season, four-time Kia MVP LeBron James steadies himself for yet another run at the hardware in his 18th season. LeBron James dropped a triple-double on the Spurs on Jan. 1. The top six of the first Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of the season is a perfect illustration of the MVP tug-of-war between new and old, fresh and familiar, that will define the competition over the course of this 72-game, truncated marathon of a season. James starts at the top with the glare of his latest Finals MVP trophy still shining. Doncic, Paul George and Joel Embiid fill in the spaces between two-time MVP Stephen Curry, with reigning and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo bracketing the top group. It\u2019s early in a season that has already been impacted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . There will no doubt be twists and turns along the way \u2014 the usual drama that accompanies a new season plus the issues unique to an unprecedented set of circumstances everyone must face in 2020-21. While change is inevitable and the notion of someone new joining the MVP crowd sends a jolt of energy into the award-chase atmosphere, there is comfort in the certainty of familiar MVP faces in these uncertain times. It comes in the form of that group led by James, Curry and Antetokounmpo (that also includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Derrick Rose). Perhaps it\u2019s time to make room at the head table for someone new. The Top 5 this week in the 2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Season stats: 24.2 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 7.9 apg, 1.0 spg No one would have blamed LeBron for easing into season No. 18 after an abbreviated offseason after leading the Lakers to the title in the Orlando bubble. But the old man (36 qualifies in the NBA) has been at his brilliantly consistent best in the early stages of this season. Even on a night when the Lakers saw their four-game win streak snapped by the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron\u2019s performance (27 points, 12 assists and six rebounds, his third game this season with 20 or more points and 10 or more assists) shines. He\u2019s set such a ridiculously high standard for himself and the rest of the crowd that follows on this list. Season stats: 27.6 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 8.0 apg, 1.0 spg Doncic put his full arsenal on display in Thursday\u2019s overtime win over the Denver Nuggets and MVP candidate Nikola Jokic. He self-corrected in game. After piling up eight turnovers entering the fourth quarter, he had none after that. Doncic also scored nine points in overtime to fuel the win and piled up a season-high 13 assists, controlling the game down the stretch. As good as Doncic has been, he\u2019s still perfecting his ability to manipulate the action. Season stats: 24.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 4.8 apg, 1.6 spg After a brutal finish in the Orlando bubble and an abbreviated offseason as a superstar pi\u00f1ata, George has gotten back on track early for a stout Clippers team (that 51-point loss to Dallas notwithstanding). He\u2019s playing at his usual elite level on both ends and at his current pace will chase the 50-40-90 holy grail of shooting in 2020-21. He vowed to bounce back with a vengeance this season and so far, so good. Kawhi Leonard remains the Clippers\u2019 biggest name and best player, but George has been LA\u2019s catalyst. Season stats: 24.6 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 3.3 apg, 1.8 bpg, 1.1 spg Embiid and the Sixers were cooking, a league-best 7-1, before they were ambushed by the Kyrie Irving-and Kevin Durant-less Brooklyn Nets Thursday night. The league\u2019s best defense, with Embiid as the anchor, was shredded. But one game doesn\u2019t erase a fantastic start to the season for Embiid in his first run under coach Doc Rivers. These first nine games have provided an excellent glimpse of what Embiid and the Sixers are capable of if he can consistently dominate the competition the way his talent suggests. Season stats: 29.6 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 6.3 apg, 1.0 spg Anyone wondering what type of fight Curry and the Warriors had in them after a rocky start to the season got their answer Sunday when the former two-time MVP torched the Portland Trail Blazers for a career-high 62 points in just 36 minutes . The Warriors are far from the juggernaut they were three seasons ago, but Curry is still as dangerous a shooter\/scorer as there is in the league. And given the absence of Klay Thompson, there will be plenty of opportunities for Curry to heat up the way he did against the Trail Blazers. 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 7.

Then came Wednesday when a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol to delay Congress from certifying the results of November\u2019s election. What James watched on television along with his family continued to reinforce his view of the wide divide in the country. \u201cWe live in two Americas and a prime example of that was yesterday. If you don\u2019t understand or see that then you need to take a step back. Not just one step but four or five or even 10 steps backward,\u201d James said Thursday night after the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the San Antonio Spurs 118-109. \u201cHow do you want your kids or grandkids to live in this beautiful country? Yesterday was not it. I couldn\u2019t help but to wonder if those were my kind storming the Capitol what would have been the outcome. We all know what would have happened if anyone even got close let alone storm or get in the offices.\u201d James wore a shirt walking into Staples Center before the game that said \u201cDo you understand now.\u201d He also had it written on his sneakers during the game. Players and coaches from both teams locked arms in a circle at midcourt during the national anthem. When asked what we meant by his shirt, James said he wants people to understand what athletes and Black people are saying. \u201cYou will never understand the feeling of being a black man and woman in America,\u201d James said. \u201cDo you understand how hard it is to continue to inspire and give everything we got? Everyone jumps on the bandwagon of what we provide, what we bring. How we dress, our music, our culture, our food. Everyone steals from what we do and then they want to act like we did it or brought it to this world. We don\u2019t get our due diligence or anything back to his country except a slap in the face.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s decision by a prosecutor in Kenosha, Wisc., not to bring charges against the officer who shot Jacob Blake, drew ire throughout the NBA. Blake\u2019s shooting was one of many social issues players focused on last summer when play resumed in the Orlando bubble. James has remained a critic of Trump during his four years in office and said that what happened at the U.S. Capitol was a direct correlation of what Trump represents. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about this country or his family. We saw the tweets along the whole path to this destruction. Over the last four years we all knew,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing you can never get back is time. We\u2019ve literally just (thrown) away four years.\u201d \u201cYesterday was shameful. We are supposed to be setting an example for all other countries on how to run things and change the world and yesterday we looked like a third-, fourth-, fifth-world country. It was embarrassing.\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who also hasn\u2019t held back in expressing his views about President Trump, said he believed Trump enjoyed Wednesday\u2019s insurrection. \u201cI believe with all my heart that Trump enjoyed it,\u201d Popovich said 90 minutes before tipoff. \u201cThey talked about the police and how easy it was and the barriers were pulled and they just walked right in. That doesn\u2019t happen unless there\u2019s a wink and a nod somewhere. That just doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s never happened at any protest anybody\u2019s ever been to. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so far fetched for people to start talking about the 25th amendment. We know it probably won\u2019t happen.\u201d Popovich also took time to laud James, calling him an \u201ciconic figure.\u201d \u201cAs a human being and citizen and someone who looks at the social issues of our time, he doesn\u2019t do it with hate. He just tells the truth,\u201d Popovich said of James."},{"id":471740,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/doncic-shines-mavs-ot-win-vs-nuggets","date":"2021-01-08","title":"Luka Doncic helping Mavs take care of clutch-time business","content":"Pupils turn teacher quickly in the NBA. At least that\u2019s the impression Luka Doncic gave Thursday on the road in schooling the Denver Nuggets down the stretch of a 124-117 Dallas Mavericks overtime victory in a duel between two of the league\u2019s brightest young stars. See, the Mavericks finished 20 th in clutch win percentage (.415) last season, and all the while, Doncic kept saying the team would eventually learn how to perform in clutch time (which is defined by the NBA as any game separated by five points or fewer in the last five minutes). \u201cLike I said those past two seasons: we\u2019re gonna learn from those things,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be a leader in those moments. I think today we did great. A lot of people hit those clutch shots.\u201d According to ESPN Stats and Information , Doncic either scored or assisted on 29 of Dallas\u2019 last 38 points of Thursday\u2019s contest, starting with 7:38 left to play on the 21-year-old\u2019s dime to Jalen Brunson. Doncic followed up his first triple-double of the season in Monday\u2019s win over the Houston Rockets with a season-high 38 points to go with nine rebounds, 13 assists and four steals against the Nuggets. The performance in the altitude at Denver served as yet another step in Doncic\u2019s rapid ascension. Doncic dominated the game in the fourth quarter and in OT by consistently making the correct plays, as opposed to just heaving up ill-advised shots in the face of double teams. \u201cIt\u2019s just continued growth,\u201d Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s just getting better and better. He understands when to be aggressive, when to be more ball dominant and when the ball needs to move. As a team, we\u2019re doing better in these situations. This is gonna be a big part of any success we\u2019re able to have this year. \u201cI liked the way Luka handled the game and always, really. It was a slow start. It was not a very rhythmic game at the beginning. Both teams were struggling to score. But he just stayed with it, and found ways to make plays, get other guys involved to get the win. This is a hard place to get a win.\u201d Yet Doncic made it all look easy. With Nikola Jokic reeling off 17 points in the fourth quarter alone , Doncic consistently drew double teams that turned him into a facilitator. Doncic connected on 2 of 3 from the field in the fourth quarter, but also dished five assists in the frame with two leading to Maxi Kleber 3-pointers. Then, in overtime, Doncic led the Mavs with nine points on 3-of-4 shooting, as they outscored Denver 15-8. \u201cFirst of all, Luka\u2019s an amazing player and he\u2019s still young,\u201d Kleber explained. \u201cI think a lot of times people forget that. But he\u2019s learning every day. He\u2019s already a complete player, has the whole package. But obviously, the more and more you play in those types of games and those types of situations, the more you\u2019re gonna learn because defenses are gonna adjust and change. He\u2019s done a great job of learning day by day. You can see how he\u2019s developed his game, gets better, and especially gets everybody else better too.\u201d Doncic found an open Kleber with 2:56 left to play for a 26-footer that gave the Mavericks a 104-102 lead. Then, with just 3.3 seconds remaining, Doncic drew a double team and quickly found Kleber again for another 26-footer that put Dallas ahead 109-107 . \u201cIt was just a great basketball play. You don\u2019t have to tell Luka Doncic that,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna calculate situations. He\u2019s gonna make sure the ball is in the right place at the right time. He was doing a good job of sharing the ball at the right times, but also getting the ball in the basket.\u201d Interestingly, Kleber had taken only one shot on Monday against the Rockets, and through the first three quarters of Thursday\u2019s contest he was 0-for-3. Still, Doncic didn\u2019t hesitate to find Kleber with the game on the line and defenders in his face. Kleber\u2019s big shot would\u2019ve served as the game winner had Jokic not nailed a 19-foot stepback jumper on Denver\u2019s next trip down the court to send it into OT. \u201cHe\u2019s a great shooter. He\u2019s a great player,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cEverybody trusts him. Everybody trusts every teammate. So, I think it was a great shot. Even if he would\u2019ve missed it, it was a great shot. I would do it [again] any day.\u201d That trust should come in handy as this young Dallas squad continues to learn how to close out tight games with Doncic exercising restraint and emphasizing playmaking. When the Mavericks opened the season with a loss at Phoenix, Doncic admitted \u201cI got to stop taking these very bad shots,\u201d before adding that \u201cit\u2019s not good for the team, and I\u2019ve got to change it.\u201d It appears Doncic, a favorite for the Kia NBA MVP Award, is well on his way. \u201cJust growing as a team, we\u2019ve been in those situations all last year,\u201d said Dorian Finney-Smith, who tied Josh Richardson for second in Mavs scoring Thursday with 14 points. \u201cAll last year I think we had a bunch of close games, and a lot of the games [were] decided in the last minute or two. Guys like me, Maxi, role players who have just been in those situations. Like today, Luka told us to be ready to shoot. Maxi was there, and he made a big shot. So, we know how much attention Luka gets so late in games. We\u2019ve just got to be ready to lock and load.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. The offensive end of the floor remains more fascinating with the Philadelphia 76ers. But just as important is that the Sixers realize their potential defensively. They have one of the league\u2019s best perimeter defenders and one of its best interior defenders, and there have been times when the Sixers have looked like the best defensive team in the league, keeping opponents away from the basket and smothering them on the perimeter. But in the last two seasons, they\u2019ve ranked 14th and eighth defensively. So while solving the offensive puzzle \u2014 with a star big man who needs to play inside and a star point guard who doesn\u2019t shoot from the outside \u2014 is a challenge, there\u2019s room for improvement on the other end of the floor as well. And a defense that\u2019s more consistently stifling would render the Sixers\u2019 offensive issues a little less important. That\u2019s been the case thus far. While the Sixers rank 12th offensively, they\u2019re a league-best 7-1, with the league\u2019s No. 1 defense entering their matchup with the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday ( 7:30 p.m. ET, TNT ). Through eight games, Philly has allowed a league-low 102.7 points per 100 possessions, 5.7 fewer than they allowed last season. That ranks as the league\u2019s fifth biggest drop. Now, the context is that five of the Sixers\u2019 eight games have come against teams \u2014 New York, Cleveland, Toronto and Charlotte (x2) \u2014 that rank in the bottom eight offensively . Only two of their eight games \u2014 both against the the sixth-ranked Washington Wizards \u2014 have come against offenses that rank higher than 18th. And on Wednesday, the Sixers had what was, easily, their worst defensive game of the season , allowing Washington to score 136 points on 110 possessions, with Bradley Beal dropping a career-high 60 . So there remains an \u201cIt\u2019s early\u201d tag on the Sixers\u2019 defense. But, while the strength of opposing offenses hasn\u2019t been great, where the Sixers rank defensively isn\u2019t necessarily inflated by poor opponent shooting from beyond the arc. Philly ranks 16th in opponent 3-point percentage (36.5%) through Wednesday. But they\u2019re No. 1 in opponent field goal percentage in the paint (47.9%), second both in the restricted area (56.2%) and on other paint shots (31.6%). Embiid is the defensive anchor and primary rim protector, but it\u2019s nice to have a point guard who also ranks in the top 20 in blocks \u2026 The win over Washington on Wednesday was the start of a stretch of four straight games against top-10 offenses . After visiting Brooklyn (fourth) on Thursday, the Sixers will host the Denver Nuggets (second) on Saturday ( 3 p.m. ET, NBA TV ) and visit the Atlanta Hawks (eighth) on Monday. Where they rank defensively after that could tell us a lot about just how good this team can be. If you\u2019ve watched the Dallas Mavericks enough over the last few years, you\u2019ve seen \u201c 21 Flip ,\u201d a play they often run out of timeouts or at the start of quarters. A wing flashes to the ball along the sideline, flips it back to the point guard, and then curls off a back-screen at the elbow \u2026 It\u2019s a fun play, it\u2019s often successful, and with this being a copy-cat league, it\u2019s not exclusively run by the Mavs. The Denver Nuggets took a turn in their Dec. 28 win over the Rockets, running the play for Gary Harris \u2026 One key to the play is the lack of weak-side help. In the Dallas version, we see Courtney Lee clearing the weak side along the baseline and taking his defender with him. If the big man\u2019s defender (LaMarcus Aldridge in the Dallas play) thinks that help (DeMar DeRozan) is still there, he won\u2019t necessarily drop back to prevent the lob. If the screener (Kristaps Porzingis or Nikola Jokic) is also a capable shooter who can pop out to a 3, the play is more difficult to defend. The Nuggets already had one of the league\u2019s most enjoyable and efficient offenses. So Mavs coach Rick Carlisle should consider it a compliment that Denver has taken a page out of his playbook. Maybe the Nuggets will run it against the Mavs on Thursday night ( 10 p.m. ET, TNT ). Or maybe the Mavs will run it against the Nuggets! Just 16 days into the season, there\u2019s still a lot of variance in how teams have performed from night to night. But something that we can evaluate more than how much teams have improved or worsened is how teams have changed the way they play. And to do that, we can compare pace, ball movement, and shot selection from last season to this season. If we just look at those three style-of-play stats and focus on the three teams at the top and bottom of the league in regard to change from last season, there are four teams that show up twice: 1. The Charlotte Hornets have seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in pace, from 96.2 possessions per 48 minutes ( 30th ) last season to 102.8 ( eighth ) this season. The Hornets have also seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in ball movement, from 345 passes per 24 minutes of possession (sixth) last season to 378 (first) this season. Neither has helped the Charlotte offense much so far. After ranking 28th offensively last season (105.9 points scored per 100 possessions), the Hornets rank 27th this season (103.9). But they have played five of their eight games against teams that rank in the top 10 defensively . Amazingly, of the Hornets\u2019 first 24 games, only two (Jan. 20 and 22) are against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 defensively . That\u2019s rough. 2. The Golden State Warriors have seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in pace, from 101.0 possessions per 48 minutes (15th) last season to 106.6 (second) this season. They\u2019ve also seen the league\u2019s second biggest *drop* in ball movement, from 389 passes per 24 minutes of possession (first) last season to 363 (third) this season. They\u2019re still moving the ball quite a bit. In fact the Warriors are one of three teams \u2014 the Hornets and Wizards are the others \u2014 that rank in the top five in both ball and player movement, where they rank first at 12.2 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession. Stephen Curry is dribbling his way through the defense a bit, but he ranks just 43rd in average seconds per touch (4.35) among 294 players with at least 100 touches through Wednesday. The Warriors\u2019 pace has been much faster with Curry on the floor (109.0 possessions per 48) than with him off the floor (103.5). 3. The New Orleans Pelicans have seen the league\u2019s biggest *drop* in pace, from 103.9 possessions per 48 minutes (fourth) last season to just 99.2 (26th) this season. The Pels have also seen the biggest drop in ball movement, from 383 passes per 24 minutes of possession (second) last season to 339 (14th) this season. Those changes have yet to really help the New Orleans offense, which ranks 22nd through Wednesday. It\u2019s probably more important that the Pels\u2019 defense has seen the league\u2019s second biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions. But that comes with the context that five of their eight games (including two against the 30th-ranked Thunder) have come against teams that rank in the bottom seven offensively. That fifth-ranked defense will really be tested on a seven-game trip that beings Monday and includes visits to the Mavs, Clippers, Lakers and Jazz (x2). 4. The Phoenix Suns have seen the league\u2019s third biggest drop in pace, from 101.7 possessions per 48 minutes (ninth) last season to 97.3 (30th) this season, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, as Chris Paul\u2019s move to Oklahoma City prior to last season resulted in the Thunder seeing the league\u2019s second biggest drop in pace from 2018-19. What\u2019s a little different about this move is that the Suns have seen the league\u2019s third biggest jump in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range, from 36.1% ( 20th ) last season to 44.1% ( eighth ) this season. Paul himself has seen a big drop ( from 34.3% to 23.1% ), but the Suns now have Jae Crowder ( 77% of his shots have come from 3-point range ) and Cameron Johnson (69%) playing most of the minutes at the four. And their back-up center is Dario Saric, who has taken more than half of his shots (16\/31) from beyond the arc. Here are the top and bottom three in regard to change in those three style-of-play stats \u2026 Pace Jump: 1. Charlotte, 2. Golden State, 3. Chicago (from 16th to third) Drop: 1. New Orleans, 2. LA Clippers (from eighth to 29th), 3. Phoenix % of shots from 3-point range Jump: 1. Oklahoma City (from 25th to second), 2. Portland (from 17th to third), 3. Phoenix Drop: 1. Sacramento (from 13th to 26th), 2. Houston (from first to fifth), 3. Minnesota (from third to 18th) Passes per 24 minutes of possession Jump: 1. Philadelphia (from 14th to second), 2. Charlotte, 3. Cleveland (from 24th to ninth) Drop: 1. New Orleans, 2. Golden State, 3. New York (from ninth to 22nd) Ever wonder why players do that one-handed scoop shot when using two hands might be the safer route? Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley is here to explain\u2026 On a big possession down the stretch of Knicks-Hawks on Monday, Trae Young seemingly had Quickley beat with a crossover move. But when he gathered the ball for a layup (as we were all taught as kids), Young brought it back to where Quickley could get his hands on it. If Young had gone straight from a right-hand dribble into a right-hand scoop shot with no gather, he\u2019d have two points. Instead, Quickley took the ball away from him ( scored as a block ) and the Knicks were going the other way. Earlier in the night, Young scored around Julius Randle with a one-handed scoop. So he has it in his repertoire \u2026 He just didn\u2019t use it after beating Quickley off the dribble, and he paid the price. That play could have put the Hawks up two with a little more than five minutes to go. Instead, it was part of a stretch where they scored just two points on seven possessions as the Knicks took control of the game. It was also an incredible defensive play by an intriguing rookie who has played a not-insignificant role in his team winning four of its last five games.

Melton scored 18.9 FD points in just 15 minutes in his first game back Tuesday. His minutes should ramp up tonight, and he\u2019s worth a look. Patty Mills (SAS) vs. LAL: 4,300 Mills erupted with 27 points Tuesday, the second time he\u2019s hit that figure in his last six games. Mills is logging minutes in the low 20s and getting plenty of work on offense. If you need a player with some scoring upside, Mills makes for a nice value. Malik Beasley (MIN) vs. POR: 5,600 Beasley has played at least 37 minutes in each of his last two games, averaging 38 FD points in the process. Tonight\u2019s matchup with Portland is one to attack, with a projected over\/under of 232.5. Kyle Anderson (MEM) vs. CLE: 5,900 Anderson had a couple of down games entering Thursday\u2019s game with Cleveland, but he has still averaged better than 30 FD points this season (eclipsing 40 points twice). He has nightly double-double potential. Tim Hardaway Jr. (DAL) vs. DEN: 5,700 Hardaway is logging more than 30 minutes over his last four games, and he just erupted for a season-high 30 points Monday against Houston. The scoring upside here exceeds the value at this price. Issac Okoro (CLE) vs. MEM: 3,600 Okoro played 28 minutes and started Tuesday against Orlando after a five-game absence. He logged 10 points and two assists, but he\u2019s seeing plenty of opportunity and tonight\u2019s matchup is friendly. Brandon Clarke (MEM) vs. CLE: 5,100 Clarke gets a great matchup with Cleveland\u2019s frontcourt tonight, and he should continue to see minutes in the high 20s. There\u2019s some 30-point upside here. JaVale McGee (CLE) vs. MEM: 4,700 McGee has been a huge lift off the bench for Cleveland this season, averaging 1.3 FD points per minute in just 17 minutes per game. He\u2019s got 30-point upside, and he\u2019s worth a flyer if you\u2019re looking to save some coin. Juancho Hernangomez (MIN) vs. POR: 4,200 As mentioned above, Minnesota\/Portland is a matchup to target tonight. Hernangomez has clearly taken over a starting role for the Wolves. He scored a season-high 46.6 points Tuesday against Denver, and his price is very much affordable. Jarrett Allen (BKN) vs. PHI: 6,300 Allen drew his first start of the season Tuesday and turned 31 minutes into 57.1 points in a tough matchup with Rudy Gobert. After the huge night, Allen is expected to start against Philly tonight, making him a high-value play at center. Jusuf Nurkic (POR) vs. MIN: 6,200 Nurkic hasn\u2019t been himself this season, but he\u2019s coming off a 36.2 FD-point performance against Chicago on Tuesday. He\u2019s got a great chance to build on that production tonight in a great spot against Minnesota.

Fultz was carried off the court after suffering a non-contact left knee injury in the first quarter of the Magic\u2019s game against Cleveland and later received an MRI that confirmed the injury. Fultz was driving in the lane when he crumpled to the floor after planting on his left leg. The fourth-year point guard was noticeably upset, slapping the floor while grabbing at his knee before being helped off the court. Fultz was off to the best start of his career, averaging 14.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 6.1 assists while helping Orlando to a 5-2 record. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge blow for us,\u201d said Magic center Nikola Vucevic, whose team also will be without standout forward Jonathan Isaac this season because of an ACL tear. \u201cUnfortunately for (Fultz) this is really sad because for two years he had the injury with his shoulder, then last year he finally got to play and this year it was supposed to be a big year for him. He was ready and he started the season out awesome. This really sucks for a guy like him who has worked his way back. It\u2019s hard to see and you feel for the guy.\u201d Fultz signed a three-year, $50 million extension last month and was finally showing the promise that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft as he led the Magic to a quick start this season. He came in averaging a career-best 14-3 points in seven games. Fultz was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers as part of their lengthy rebuild but struggled for years with a difficult-to-diagnose shoulder injury ultimately determined to be thoracic outlet syndrome, a nerve ailment that affected the feeling in his arm and hand. He was traded to the Magic in February 2019. Rookie Cole Anthony, who had eight points, four rebounds and three assists on Wednesday, will now be the starter at point guard for the Magic. \u201cThis is part of the league. It happens, people get hurt,\u201d Magic guard Terrence Ross said. \u201cWe play a lot and go through a lot and people get hurt. We\u2019ve still got to keep playing ball. We have a way to play and we can\u2019t let the whole season fall or collapse because of a couple of injuries.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Ahead of the league\u2019s 11-game slate on Wednesday, coaches and players around the NBA watched several shocking scenes unfold as groups of protestors broke through barriers and destroyed property inside the Capitol building. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty disturbing, obviously. Sad,\u201d Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers said Wednesday ahead of his team\u2019s matchup against the Washington Wizards. \u201cBut what is not is I keep hearing this is an attack on democracy. It\u2019s not. Democracy will prevail. It always does. It shows a lot, though. You know, when you saw the protests in the summer and you saw the riots, or more the police and the National Guard and the Army, and then you see this, and you saw nothing. It basically proves a point about a privileged life in a lot of ways. \u201cI\u2019ll say it because I don\u2019t think a lot of people want to,\u201d Rivers added. \u201cCould you imagine today if those were all black people storming the Capitol and what would have happened? So that, to me, is a picture that\u2019s worth a thousand words for all of us to see, and probably something for us to reckon with. Again, you know, no police dogs turned on people, no billy clubs hitting people; people peacefully being escorted out of the Capitol. So, it shows that you can disperse a crowd peacefully, I guess. But it\u2019s a sad day in a lot of ways; not good for our country.\u201d Rivers wasn\u2019t alone in pointing out the differences in the presence of law enforcement officials and their actions during Wednesday\u2019s protests at the Capitol, compared to the vast resources utilized to quell unrest over the summer involving the Black Lives Matter movement in the aftermath of the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. In Miami, before the Boston Celtics squared off against the Miami Heat, the players issued a joint statement and indicated there was some thought of not playing the nationally televised game. In Milwaukee, the Bucks and Detroit Pistons each took turnovers on their first possessions \u2014 intentionally, with all 10 players on the court kneeling. In Atlanta, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said \u201cit\u2019ll never change\u201d until the country acknowledges the difference in how law enforcement treats people of color, compared to non-minorities. \u201cIt\u2019ll never change unless there\u2019s acknowledgement in the past with regards to how African Americans have always been treated in the history of that and going back to slavery and going back to Reconstruction and going back to civil rights,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that things are going to change if you don\u2019t acknowledge that it\u2019s a problem. What you\u2019re seeing today is a reminder there\u2019s a huge difference. There\u2019s a reason why there [aren\u2019t] shooting and brutality and looting and things of that nature, and people are just walking around the Capitol building as if it\u2019s nothing; and people sitting in [Speaker of the House of Representatives] Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office as if it\u2019s nothing. \u201cWe all understand that there would\u2019ve been guns ablaze and fires ablaze right now if there were Black people protesting, and if there were Black people protesting on the outside. We haven\u2019t even mentioned the inside and tearing up the building. \u201cBut nothing is going to change until we acknowledge there is a huge difference in how Black people are treated in regard to law enforcement,\u201d Pierce added. \u201cThat just hasn\u2019t happened. We\u2019ve been fighting about that. There\u2019s been protests about that. There\u2019s a reason why people have encouraged others to get out and vote to change leaders. But until you truly acknowledge there is a difference in how Black people are treated in this country, and especially in regard to law enforcement in situations like this, that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d New Orleans Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy expressed similar sentiments, and posted a Tweet rhetorically asking how law enforcement would have handled Wednesday\u2019s incident had it involved Black Lives Matters protesters. \u201cWould the federal response at the Capitol now be the same if it were Black Lives Matters protesters physically forcing their way into the building?\u201d Van Gundy wrote. \u201cRemember the response in Oregon that was said to be needed to protect federal property?\u201d Hired back in October to replace Alvin Gentry as head coach of the Pelicans, Van Gundy has long advocated for social justice, and once told Marc Spears of The Undefeated that \u201cI only know about these issues, and these problems, and these inequities from people I\u2019ve been associated with, work with, know, care about,\u201d before adding that \u201cjust because something doesn\u2019t happen to you, if it\u2019s happening to people you know, if it\u2019s happening to people you care about, you care about the issue.\u201d Multiple active and inactive NBA players expressed similar depths of concern on Twitter. \u201cAn absolute disgrace what\u2019s happening at the US Capitol right now,\u201d Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love posted to Twitter . \u201cAnd a blatant example of inequity in how law enforcement chooses to deal with those involved.\u201d Jamal Crawford tweeted that \u201cyou do things like this when you know there is a certain privilege where nothing is gonna happen to you.\u201d Meanwhile, Chicago Bulls guard Garrett Temple tweeted that he was neither shocked or embarrassed by Wednesday\u2019s events. \u201cI scan my timeline and keep seeing the word \u201cembarrassing,\u201d\u201d Temple wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed, I\u2019m not surprised, or shocked even. Embarrassed would mean that I feel a sense of shame by what is going on. I have no such feeling. These people do not come close to being a representation of me.\u201d Rivers\u2019 opponent on Wednesday night, Scott Brooks, head coach of the Washington Wizards, called Wednesday\u2019s events \u201csad and embarrassing.\u201d \u201cWe should be better than this. What I see in the videos, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThis is a special place. You just hope that everybody from there, our fans; everybody\u2019s safe. This should not be allowed. It\u2019s unacceptable. This is America\u2019s Capitol. You should not be able to do what I saw on video. It\u2019s disgusting, it\u2019s embarrassing, and it should never happen. We have to [play]. This is our job. This is what we have to do. It\u2019s a couple hours out of the day. We all feel the same. It\u2019s just disgusting, but we have to be better. Democracy is there for a reason. It\u2019s all everybody has fought for.\u201d NBAPA executive director Michele Roberts spoke to ESPN in the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s events, and like many of her colleagues around the league, pointed out the racial double standard that the breaching of the U.S. Capitol displayed to the entire country. \u201c We saw a Black police officer being chased , and players said to me, \u2018So this is what they can do?\u2019 And people don\u2019t get this privilege stuff. I know how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Roberts told ESPN. \u201cI am so angry and pained \u2014 and refusing to cry. It reminded me of something that James Baldwin said, when asked what it was like to be a Negro in the United States of America. He said that if you\u2019re conscious of what\u2019s going on in the country, and you\u2019re a Negro, you\u2019re in a constant state of rage. \u201cOn a day like this, it\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind. And all I can say is that I\u2019m grateful knowing that hopefully nobody who looks like me is going to Capitol Hill to respond to this, because if they do, you\u2019ll see a different response by law enforcement. You know it \u2014 and I know it.\u201d When the 2019-20 NBA season returned from a COVID-19 hiatus back in July, the league allowed \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d to be painted on the courts, approved social justice messages on the backs of players\u2019 jerseys and allowed coaches and players to kneel during the player of the national anthem. The league\u2019s collective activism was on full display . After the Jacob Blake shooting by law enforcement in Kenosha, Wisconsin back in August, the Milwaukee Bucks decided to not play their first-round playoff game against the Orlando Magic. On Tuesday, Kenosha (WI) County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced he would not bring charges against the police officer who shot and paralyzed Blake. That announcement and what took place at the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday seemed significant in undermining much of the efforts put forth around the NBA and the WNBA, which has in many respects led the charge. Houston Rockets coach Stephen Silas struggled to articulate what the world witnessed at the U.S. Capitol building. \u201cThere\u2019s so many layers to it. There\u2019s what\u2019s going on at the Capitol building and then there\u2019s the why, and then there\u2019s the way for that; the division and all this other stuff,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThere is a long history of division in our country when it comes to political party. But it seems like right now, there is more of a division in just like, humanity. That\u2019s what I\u2019m grappling with and struggling with right now.\u201d Oklahoma City Thunder coach Mark Daigneault viewed the incident as a reminder of how much progress is still needed in this country, starting with some serious reflection. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s appalling and pretty surreal. This is a great country,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also one where there\u2019s times where it\u2019s hard to recognize ourselves. The distance between who we want to be, who we think we are and who we really are sometimes is vast at certain times. This, along with a long string of events in recent history is just yet another reminder of how far we have to go.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

In Miami, the Heat and Boston Celtics released a joint statement saying they were playing \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d in a game where most players and coaches knelt for the national anthem. In Milwaukee, the Bucks and Detroit Pistons both took turnovers on their first possessions \u2014 intentionally, with all 10 players on the court kneeling. And in Phoenix, the Suns and Toronto Raptors stood in a circle and linked arms for the American and Canadian anthems. The following is the statement from the players of the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat: \u201c2021 is a new year, but some things have not changed. We play tonight\u2019s game with a heavy heart after yesterday\u2019s decision in Kenosha, and knowing that protesters in our nation\u2019s capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on. The drastic difference between the way protesters this past spring and summer were treated and the encouragement given to today\u2019s protestors who acted illegally just shows how much more work we have to do. \u201cWe have decided to play tonight\u2019s game to try to bring joy into people\u2019s lives. But we must not forget the injustices in our society, and we will continue to use our voices and our platform to highlight these issues and do everything we can to work for a more equal and just America.\u201d Earlier in the day at the Capitol, a mob delayed Congress from certifying the results of November\u2019s election and paving the way for President-elect Joe Biden to be sworn in later this month. \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassing and shameful day in our country,\u201d New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. In San Francisco, the Golden State Warriors donned \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirts and knelt for the anthem, as did their opponent, the Los Angeles Clippers. Wednesday\u2019s events came one day after the decision not to bring charges against the officer who shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year was announced. Blake\u2019s shooting was one of the many issues players focused on last season in the NBA restart bubble, where the issues of racial injustice and police brutality were a constant focus. The joint Heat-Celtics statement said, in part: \u201c2021 is a new year, but some things have not changed. We play tonight\u2019s game with a heavy heart after yesterday\u2019s decision in Kenosha, and knowing that protesters in our nation\u2019s capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on.\u201d The Celtics discussed the Blake decision earlier in the day, before the events from the Capitol unfolded. The Celtics then met again as a team after arriving at the arena in Miami, discussed options, and coach Brad Stevens even called his wife to say that he didn\u2019t think his team would take the floor. Boston ultimately chose to play, beating Miami 107-105. \u201cThey\u2019ve operated in a win-at-all-costs attitude,\u201d Stevens said of Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cI don\u2019t know, our sports world is a lot less important, obviously. But I\u2019ve always thought if you operated with a win-at-all-costs attitude, it\u2019s going to be a pretty unfulfilling ending. And in this situation, a disgraceful ending. So, I\u2019m looking forward to two weeks from now, as I know a lot of other people are, too.\u201d Biden will be inaugurated two weeks from Wednesday, on Jan. 20. The NBA had a rule for decades that players and coaches must stand for the national anthem. That rule was relaxed last year when the season resumed at the bubble inside Walt Disney World. The Bucks won the opening tap of their game, and instead of running a play two-time reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo simply held the ball as all players knelt. That resulted in a turnover, as did the ensuing Detroit possession when Blake Griffin held the ball and players took a knee again. The Bucks said after the game they held the ball for 7 seconds to reflect the seven times Blake was shot. \u201cWe want to do things to help make change, be on the right side of the fight, continue to fight, not be in any way, shape or form distracted or slowed or moved in the wrong direction,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cWe need to keep moving forward in all ways, shapes and forms.\u201d Meanwhile, a men\u2019s college basketball game scheduled to be played in Washington on Wednesday night was postponed after a city curfew was imposed in response to the mob\u2019s actions at the Capitol. The Atlantic 10 Conference game between George Washington and UMass will be rescheduled by the league. Another Washington-based team, Georgetown, took a knee for the anthem before facing Butler in Indianapolis. \u201cI\u2019m saddened,\u201d Hoyas coach Patrick Ewing said in response to the day\u2019s events. There were 11 games on Wednesday\u2019s NBA schedule. All were played. \u201cIt feels a little odd to play a game tonight, to be honest,\u201d Charlotte coach James Borrego said before his club played in Atlanta. Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers, who is Black, spoke of the stark difference between rallies across America last summer that often included violent skirmishes between protesters and police and what he watched at the Capitol on Wednesday. \u201cThe symbolism of storming the Capitol without force done to them, if you\u2019re a Black American, it definitely touches you in a different way,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThis is not a Black thing. This is an American thing.\u201d"},{"id":470592,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-wednesday-jan-6","date":"2021-01-06","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Wednesday (Jan. 6)","content":"De\u2019Aaron Fox (SAC) vs. CHI: $7,800 De\u2019Aaron Fox is free money tonight.

He played 33 minutes last night, which isn\u2019t terrible, but Lou Williams could be a decent alternative for just $200 more since he logged only 21 minutes last night. Devin Booker (PHO) vs. TOR: $7,600 Devin Booker shouldn\u2019t be this cheap. He\u2019s averaging 31.32 FDPPG, which could be better, but the Raptors give up the 10th-most FDPPG to shooting guards, and the Suns should win this one handily. Donte DiVincenzo (MIL) vs. DET: $4,800 If you\u2019re looking to spend down at shooting guard, Donte DiVincenzo has been a fantastic play all year. He averages 24.3 FDPPG, and he scored 30-plus points in two of his last three matchups. He\u2019s a safe option against a Pistons team that surrenders the second-most FDPPG to the position. Kevin Huerter (ATL) vs. CHA: $4,500 Kevin Huerter should be a safe option in what should be a high-scoring game \u2014 the Vegas total currently sits at 232.5. RJ Barrett (NYK) vs. UTA: $6,500 I like RJ Barrett against the Jazz, as they\u2019re giving up the fifth-most FDPPG to opposing small forwards. Barrett won\u2019t cost you a ton of cap space and has flashed massive upside recently, including a 52.7 FanDuel point showing his last time out. Kelly Oubre (GSW) vs. LAC: $5,300 Kelly Oubre should be a viable option against a banged-up Clippers team. He averages 25 FDPPG, but he scored 30-plus FanDuel points in both of his most recent outings. Denzel Valentine (CHI) at SAC: $3,600 Denzel Valentine is a high-risk punt play. He\u2019s fresher than most of Chicago\u2019s lineup, as he played only 19 minutes off the bench yesterday, and he\u2019d be in line for more work if guys like Zach LaVine (43 minutes) and Coby White (39 minutes) get some rest. John Collins (ATL) vs. CHA: $6,800 John Collins hasn\u2019t had a great start to the year, but he should bounce back against the Hornets, as they give up the most FDPPG to point guards. Chris Boucher (TOR) at PHX: $6,200 I don\u2019t hate Chris Boucher at this price point, especially since he\u2019s averaging 28.8 FDPPG, but he may not have as much ceiling as you\u2019d like in what\u2019s likely to be an unfavorable, low-scoring game. Nicolas Batum (LAC) at GSW: $4,400 Like the other Clippers I\u2019ve featured here, Nicolas Batum could be in line for more minutes if George and Leonard sit. That said, he played 36 minutes last night, so we\u2019ll see how much the Clippers use the 32-year-old tonight. Rudy Gobert (UTA) at NYK: $8,200 Tonight\u2019s a Rudy Gobert night. The Knicks allow their opponents to grab 58.5 boards per game, the third-most in the NBA, and Gobert should absolutely feast on the glass tonight. More on this below. Bismack Biyombo (CHA) at ATL: $5,100 If you\u2019re pivoting away from Gobert, Bismack Biyombo is a decent value option against the Hawks. He averages 24.3 FDPPG, and while the matchup isn\u2019t great, this should be a high-scoring game with lots of points on both sides. Ivica Zubac (LAC) at GSW: $3,900 Ivica Zubac could be in line for some extra minutes with the Clippers dealing with numerous injuries while on a back-to-back.

The league told teams they should establish \u201ceducation and awareness materials focused on managing mental health during times of uncertainty and coping strategies for addressing the emotional toll of the pandemic.\u201d \u201cGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, taking care of one\u2019s mental health and having access to resources are important aspects of managing the feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, and stress that have characterized much of 2020 and will in all likelihood be present during the 2020-21 season,\u201d the league wrote in a memo obtained by The Associated Press. The NBA has mandated that teams offer access to mental health professionals in recent seasons \u2014 a program the league calls Mind Health was launched nearly three years ago \u2014 but that obviously predates the pandemic and how countless aspects of day-to-day life has changed in recent months. Most arenas don\u2019t have fans and those that do only allow a limited number of people at games. Players and coaches are tested daily, travel parties have been pared down from what used to be normal and, starting Tuesday, those on the bench to start a game must wear masks until they enter the contest. Those are a few of the ways the NBA has changed amid the virus. \u201cAll this is a little bit like the Twilight Zone,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said when asked about the mental strain of playing amid a pandemic. \u201cEverything looks the same. In many ways, it can operate in a similar way. But we all know it is different. And that has a different effect on different people, for sure.\u201d Part of the new guidance from the league: that social distancing guidelines still need to be followed when mental health services are provided at a team facility, and that teams should offer \u201cample availability for telehealth services\u201d where players can meet with mental health professionals. Those are in addition to existing requirements put in place last year and remaining for the 2020-21 season regarding making mental health professionals available to players on a voluntary basis, having a licensed psychiatrist available to assist players with any issues, having procedures in place to ensure confidentiality and, more recently, offering services that \u201cshould be culturally competent \u2026 and meet the needs of the diverse NBA community.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to have an environment where everybody feels like they can come to our team setting, plug in, be themselves, focus on their craft and be around like-minded people,\u201d Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cWhat we believe is if we build that environment where everybody is thriving \u2026 then if there are stressors that are related to health or where we\u2019re at as a country or just the natural stressors of an NBA season, then that environment can raise the level of our players and we can all support each other.\u201d In a separate move Wednesday, the National Basketball Coaches Association released the quarterly health bulletin that it sends to members, also addressing mental health. \u201cThe usage of mental health tools and support platforms has increased as have the modalities to assist those in need. These include meditation apps, journaling, engaging in therapy with a professional or a support group as well as other mindful techniques, such as yoga,\u201d the NBCA wrote. Mental health has been a priority for the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association in recent years, especially after players like Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love and San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan opened up about their inner struggles with anxiety and other issues. Many players also spoke out this past summer about the strain of being isolated during the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World in Central Florida."},{"id":470623,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavs-darius-garland-has-shoulder-sprain-donte-exum-could-miss-two-months","date":"2021-01-06","title":"Cavs' Darius Garland has shoulder sprain, Dante Exum could miss 2 months","content":"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Cleveland Cavaliers starting guard Darius Garland might miss another week with a shoulder sprain, while guard Dant\u00e9 Exum could miss two months with a calf strain. Cleveland provided the injury updates Wednesday before playing the Magic for the second time in three days. Garland began experiencing discomfort in his shoulder last week during a game in Atlanta. He was kept out of Monday\u2019s loss and underwent an MRI. The second-year guard is averaging 17.2 points and 6.3 assists in six starts. He averaged 12.3 points in his abbreviated rookie season. Exum injured his calf in the first quarter Monday. The Cavaliers said he\u2019ll begin treatments and rehab and is expected to miss approximately six to eight weeks of basketball activity. Exum has made three starts for the Cavs, who have been dealing with numerous injuries since the start of the season.

This season, it\u2019s taken all of two weeks. But based on the games, the news, the injuries, the purported trades, some controversies and the vital and unusual safety protocols in place for a non-bubble 72-game season, the first two weeks of 2020-21 seem to have had two months worth of everything. Except, of course, a James Harden trade, which might never come. Here are five takeaways from 15 days: The return of Stephen Curry: Golden State\u2019s season began with little to recommend it, a rerun of 2019-20 for all its promise and watchability. Then Curry went Currazy in the second of consecutive games against Portland Trail Blazers, scoring 62 points to remind the basketball world that he\u2019s still the league\u2019s best point guard and one of its most dazzling scorers ever. Next game, Curry got 30 in just three quarters before sitting down against the Sacramento Kings. He\u2019s getting to the line more, shooting 2-pointers and showing hints of some retro Allen Iverson play. It might be asking a lot to have this version of Curry all season, but it is satisfying to see him step up when his Warriors cohorts have lots of rough edges. Home-and-home sets: This quirk of booking two games in the same city, same opponents, is a nod to the virus protocols, done to reduce the number of flights and hotel stays if those intra-conference games were booked as separate trips. It\u2019s not likely to survive when things get back to (dare we say) normal, for at least three reasons. First, bunching games so tightly against one foe can create a real disadvantage if one team\u2019s star happens to be hurt that week \u2014 the other guys get two bites at the apple while, say, a Kevin Durant or Luka Doncic is out. Second, it might be tough to sell tickets for some of these weekend series. Third, pitching tents in a road city for three nights could be an invitation to some distractions. Still, there\u2019s a mini-playoff vibe to seeing an instant rematch, the way the Miami Heat bounced back from its 47-point spanking by Milwaukee last week to beat the Bucks 24 hours later in the same building. We get a chance to see adjustments, grudges, lineup changes and other inside games with this little baseball series. Heavyweights on hold: Sean Grande, radio play-by-play man for the Boston Celtics, pulled together a fascinating set of stats as the season wrapped up Week 2: Eight teams that played into September in the Orlando bubble restart, who began last season with a .678 winning percentage, had dipped to .511. Meanwhile, the eight teams not invited into the bubble went from a .297 start in 2019-20 to .411 this year. That suggests a freshness vs. fatigue factor has been in play with some of the inverted early standings. But the Los Angeles Lakers played to the bitter end (Oct. 11) and have done fine. No way struggling teams like the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets are going to blame only that for their sputtering starts. The Raptors have had trouble scoring, haven\u2019t gotten the Pascal Siakam they envisioned when he became their leading man and have admitted to some problems of cohesion and resiliency. To their credit, they haven\u2019t played the \u201cR\u201d card \u2014 as in relocation, playing home games in Tampa for what really is a 72-date road schedule. The Nuggets have had some absences, with Michael Porter Jr. sitting lately due to health protocols, and have seen what was figured to be a strength (depth) produce some pretty shaky bench play. No one should be panicking yet, but this compacted season is flying by so problems not fixed promptly might never get solved. Bunch of blowouts: A trend that was most apparent on Christmas Day , when the five games were decided by a total of 116 points, has continued. According to Tim Reynolds of The Associated Press, 25% of the games played so far have seen one team leading by at least 30 points. The past three seasons, that rate was 10%, 11% and 9%, respectively. Why? Pick your theory. The flattening of any real homecourt advantage, what with mostly empty buildings that deprive a home team of drawing inspiration and comeback ability from its crowd? Those game-to-game adjustments when facing a foe on back-to-back dates? The short run-up and prep time to this season? We\u2019ll have more ideas if the tendency continues. Happiness in The Big Apple: It doesn\u2019t take much at this point to rouse the New York Knicks\u2019 fan base, and that team\u2019s 4-3 record heading into Wednesday\u2019s game against the Utah Jazz ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) has been plenty. The rout of Milwaukee on Dec. 27 started some buzz, but the victories at Indiana and Atlanta dialed it up to high. Forward Julius Randle has posted big stats (22.1 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 7.4 apg) while hitting 40.7% from 3-point range, reminding folks he was the No. 7 pick six years ago. RJ Barrett began this season as if he has a chip on his shoulder after catching insiders yawning over his rookie play. And first-round pick Immanuel Quickley has shown chops at both ends, beyond what a No. 25 pick typically shows so early. But the Knicks\u2019 biggest improvement has come on the sideline, where coach Tom Thibodeau is having a palate-cleansing, culture-changing impact. The famously gruff, demanding Thibodeau has seemed more even-handed, while getting a quick bump like he did in Chicago and, arguably, Minnesota. The Knicks have bought into his defensive lessons to rank near the top in opponents\u2019 field-goal percentages, with a leap in defensive rating. Presumably, as the season grinds on, critics will start parsing minutes to see if Thibs is relying too heavily on Randle, Barrett or anyone else. But for now, a young roster without many changes has been listening and believing. Honorable mention to the Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic, Cleveland Cavaliers and Phoenix Suns, all of whom are also off to unexpectedly upbeat starts. * * *"},{"id":470289,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-paul-george-sits-out-with-ankle-injury-vs-spurs","date":"2021-01-06","title":"Clippers' Paul George sits out with ankle injury vs Spurs","content":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Paul George sat out for the Los Angeles Clippers against the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night.

Unsurprisingly, this game has the highest over\/under on the slate at 233.5, and it\u2019s one to target. Jamal Murray (DEN) MIN $7,900 Murray comes in at nearly $8K, but with his recent performances, that\u2019s still a value. Across his last two games, Murray has averaged nearly 49 FD points while scoring at least 30 real points in each contest. After a slow start to the season, Murray is finally turning it on, and his price tag hasn\u2019t yet caught up. Caris LeVert (BKN) UTA $6,100 With Kevin Durant out this week due to health protocols, LeVert should assume a larger role in the offense. The matchup with Utah isn\u2019t a scary one, and LeVert has shown his ability to stuff the stat sheet when given additional opportunities. Otto Porter (CHI) POR $5,300 Porter has averaged a robust 35.4 FD points across his last three, and he\u2019s stepped up in a big way with Lauri Markkanen (COVID-19) out of action. Expect Porter to see plenty of minutes and scoring opportunities in what\u2019s projected to be the highest scoring matchup of the night. Joe Harris (BKN) UTA $4,600 Harris has played big for Brooklyn over the last week, averaging 29.5 FD points across his last four games. With Kevin Durant out and playing in a game with a healthy 231.5 over\/under, Harris is a great salary-saving option who could blow away his current value. Naz Reid (MIN) DEN $4,800 With Karl-Anthony Towns still on the shelf, I\u2019m willing to take a flyer on Reid, who should see minutes in the mid-20s against a friendly Denver defense. Reid has 30-point upside, and at just $4.8K, he\u2019s a nice value. Daniel Gafford (CHI) POR $3,500 Power forward tonight consists of Anthony Davis ($10K) at the top and then a steep plummet to Bojan Bogdanovic at $5.3K. You should pay up for Davis, but the options in the mid-tier are pretty uninspired. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll roll the dice on Daniel Gafford, a guy priced at the very lowest salary, who\u2019s averaged just under 23 FD points across his last three games, and who averages just over 1.0 FD points per minute this season. He\u2019s a risk\/reward GPP play and a guy I\u2019ll stay away from in cash games. Montrezl Harrell (LAL) MEM $5,300 Harrell has seen his playing time drop in recent games, but he\u2019s been efficient with his opportunities, and he\u2019ll get another crack at a Grizzlies\u2019 squad he just posted 31.8 FD points against Sunday. Enes Kanter (POR) POR $5,200 Kanter has provided three double-doubles already this season, and he\u2019s played meaningful minutes off the bench for the Blazers.

Your status is determined by what happens once the sides are chosen. Then it becomes pure basketball, accepting all recreational players willing to risk an ankle sprain for the love of hoop. And that\u2019s why he walked into the gym here at the First Church of the Nazarene at dawn on Jan. 5, 1988, to embrace a game he\u2019d played all his life. A 40-year-old who recently found God also chose to reconnect with basketball, and this calling was every bit as spiritual. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d announced Dr. James Dobson, who organized the weekly pickup games. \u201cPete\u2019s here.\u201d Pete Maravich obviously had credentials far beyond the collection of middle-aged 9-to-5ers who excitedly negotiated amongst themselves to be his teammate. This was a rare exception to the pickup rule where someone\u2019s status did matter, although Maravich was no ringer, not seven years into retirement. He was still linguine-thin and kept a mop of hair, but he had knees that were duct-taped, a bum shoulder and more rust than an antique store. Most revealingly, his socks no longer flopped. But: Here in everyone\u2019s midst was a basketball legend, \u201cPistol Pete\u201d in the dry-aged flesh, and so \u2026 \u201cHey guys,\u201d he said, cheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s everyone?\u201d Well. That question was unnecessary, because with Maravich in the gym, ready to mix with regular Joes, this was a you\u2019re-not-going-to-believe-this story anxious to be told tomorrow at the office cooler. Everyone was thrilled, thank you very much. As fate would have it, that very same question would be repeated about 45 minutes later, this time with the tables turned. Dobson, sizing up a sweaty Maravich while they stood near the free throw line, catching their breath between games: \u201cHow do ya feel, Pete?\u201d \u201cI feel great.\u201d And then, when heart failure caused Pete Maravich to suddenly collapse face-first to the floor, the cruelty is how his body allowed him to live just long enough to tell that lie. Or maybe his defective heart showed mercy, allowing him to live long enough to throw slick passes and score thousands of points and dribble with amazing command in the first place. Whatever the conclusion, a transformational NBA star died tragically and instantly in the prime of his life one January morning here in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains just outside Los Angeles, and it would be three decades before that would happen again. Pete Maravich and Kobe Bryant, both game-changers, were very special while very young, groomed by demanding fathers, performed at breathless levels and earned a space on the wall inside the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Curiously, their final resting places were only 20 miles apart. However: The difference in the public reaction to those deaths was big enough to fit their combined scoring averages. When a helicopter carrying Bryant and others crashed into a hillside near Calabasas a year ago this month, folks as far away as France developed cantaloupes in their dry throats. The tragedy instantly became a where-were-you-at flashpoint in the lives of millions, the kind that get frozen in time and seared in the memory. Thousands of fans did group therapy by quietly loitering, zombie-like, outside of the Staples Center for days, and leaving behind basketballs and home-made sympathy cards for the Bryant family, and holding lit candles while wearing Kobe jerseys. Big, strong NBA players cried. Just the shock of it all, combined with the addition of his 13-year-old daughter, Gigi, in the crash, was haunting. Beyonce sang at his memorial before 18,000 sniffling mourners at Staples. Whoever was the Beyonce of 1988 did not sing at Maravich\u2019s memorial at the First Baptist Church ( \u201c Hundreds Mourn Basketball Great \u201d was the next day\u2019s Associated Press headline) near the campus of LSU, where he broke records and any defense thrown his way. The Atlanta Hawks, Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics, the franchises Maravich repped in his 10-year NBA career, played the next game on the schedule, unlike the Lakers, who were too crushed about Kobe. Except in Louisiana, where he lived and was adored then and even now, Maravich was the lead story only for a day. Certainly, the world changed since. Kobe\u2019s career began just as the NBA\u2019s popularity mushroomed; he also played in the age of 24-hour sports TV and for the world\u2019s most appealing team; and social media now amplifies everything, especially for the famous. Twitter didn\u2019t crash the day Maravich died because Twitter was two decades too late. This wasn\u2019t the first time Maravich was a victim of timing. His basketball tricks made him a highlight pioneer \u2026 in the 1970s, before TV actually showed basketball highlights. Few players could match the contents in his bag, which included behind-the-back passes thrown from 30 feet, between-the-legs dribbles with either hand, and body-contorting jumpers from any spot on the floor. Slow-motion replay wasn\u2019t invented for him but it explained him. Maravich is one of the few players from bygone eras who wouldn\u2019t need to overhaul his game to flourish today, and actually could be more effective now, with rules against hand-checking and the emphasis on the 3-pointer. Plus, he hurt his knees well before surgical medical advancements arrived to extend careers. And so, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude this: Had he played this decade with current technology to repair those knees, and died in today\u2019s viral world under the exact same suddenness as in 1988, the reaction from passing of \u201cthe Pistol\u201d \u2014 who was a year younger than Kobe at the time of their deaths \u2014 would be seismic. If nothing else, Maravich\u2019s death left a tattoo on the pickup players who witnessed his final moments. Those accountants, lawyers and businessmen are still shook by the sight of Maravich lying on his stomach, foaming at the mouth. Some in the group hysterically searched for help while others were too stuck to the floor to move. Maravich died; they wear the scars. \u201cPete could\u2019ve died anywhere in the world but he died with us and there\u2019s got to be a reason for that,\u201d Gary Lydic said. \u201cWe were just a bunch of guys in a gym. We didn\u2019t know him, never met him before. We couldn\u2019t figure out why he was with us. Still can\u2019t.\u201d Maravich was in town because that\u2019s where his journey of faith led him. He flew to California from his home in Covington, La., to tape a Christian radio show for the Focus on the Family ministry led by Dobson. By then, Maravich found a purpose in his post-basketball life after a desperate personal search that detoured through depression and a bout with the bottle. As a child prodigy, basketball was all Maravich knew. His father, Press, schooled him early and often. The two were inseparable through college because Press was his coach at every step. Some stories of Maravich\u2019s quirky practice techniques had the ring of truth; others were fanciful. Like: Did he really sharpen his ball control by dribbling out the window from the car passenger seat while his father drove slowly? After a college career that surely will never be repeated \u2014 Maravich averaged 44.2 ppg for three years without the 3-point line (!) or shot-clock (!!) \u2014 his NBA career was brilliantly bittersweet. When healthy and at his peak, Maravich was a hellish offensive player, a five-time All-Star, twice named All-NBA First Team, and led the league in scoring at 31.1 ppg in 1977-78 when he dropped 68 in a game. But, he only played 43 games after the introduction of the 3-point line. His defense often lagged. He was trapped on mostly mismanaged teams, never with a champion. And he hobbled his final three seasons, injuries stealing his movement and confidence. When basketball was done with him, Maravich acknowledged he was \u201clost\u201d and, after spending his time drowning in sorrow and solitude right after retirement, he embarked on an age of rediscovery. He tried Hinduism, went vegan before it was trendy, and even became a UFO truther. Ultimately, he arrived at Christianity and the religion affected every facet of his rebirth. He was a sought-after speaker for church groups and gatherings and agreed to spend a few days in Pasadena at the request of Dr. Dobson, an evangelical leader and influential national voice. Dobson also was a passionate pickup player and for three days each week led a different kind of congregation at the Pasadena church. \u201cI loved to play and inviting Pete was one of the most audacious things I\u2019d ever done,\u201d Dobson said. \u201cHe was showtime before anyone knew what showtime was.\u201d The usual pickup gang was alerted days earlier about a special guest, and the player assigned with bringing Maravich from the hotel at 6 a.m. was Lydic, who couldn\u2019t sleep the night before. Lydic parked at the San Dimas Inn and was embarrassed about using his dented Chevy Blazer to transport a VIP, but Maravich put him at ease instantly by extending a handshake and saying, \u201cThis must be the man.\u201d As Lydic tried to change lanes from the on-ramp, he swerved suddenly to dodge a speeding van. He remembers thinking: \u201cLord, not now, not with Pete in the car.\u201d Along the way, Lydic told Maravich about his father, who was fighting cancer in Dayton, and how it drained the family and him personally. Maravich suddenly perked up. His own father, Press, lost a four-year battle with prostate cancer the previous spring. Pete took over his father\u2019s life those final years \u2014 seeking alternative and holistic medicines in Germany, spoon-feeding him, changing his clothes, even bathing him. \u201cGary,\u201d said Maravich in the car, \u201cI\u2019ve been there, and I want to go through this with you.\u201d They arrived to see the players waiting. Norm Moline had earlier searched his mother\u2019s attic and found a Maravich rookie card he hoped to get signed, and also brought a camcorder to video the action. Ralph Drollinger was the only player besides Maravich with any pedigree; Drollinger jumped center for two John Wooden championship teams at UCLA and had lunch in the NBA . Chris Hancock was anxious to play with and against Maravich and then return home to celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday, obviously with much to tell, even to a four-year-old. Drollinger and Maravich were put on opposite teams to make it even. The former pros shared a wink and a nod, which was code for: Let them have their fun. \u201cMe and Pete were amused by the other guys trying to impress us,\u201d Drollinger said. Maravich moved slowly and gingerly. He already confessed he hadn\u2019t played in months, and even then, rarely. His sore shoulder restricted his range of motion. He blended in, much to the surprise and relief of a group that initially feared a one-man takeover. \u201cI remember Pete throwing up one shot that banked in that he didn\u2019t intend to bank,\u201d Hancock said. The two games were typical of half-court pickup ball, first to 20 wins the game, then extended breaks for wheezing middle-agers. Moline videoed the first game, then handed his camcorder to someone else and played the next. \u201cPete was funny,\u201d Moline said. \u201cWe would do some spin moves trying to impress him and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t believe your own headlines.\u2019 He was having fun, a real enjoyable guy. Just teasing and joking.\u201d After a second break, and as others went for the water fountain, Maravich and Dobson stayed and spoke. Right before saying how great he felt, Maravich took a practice shot, which was retrieved by Lydic under the rim. \u201cI went to rebound it and started to pass the ball back to Pete and before I could do that, boom, he hit the floor,\u201d Lydic said. \u201cI knew he had a great sense of humor. I started to walk over and I was believing he was going to jump up in my face. But that was not the case. As I got closer I saw his eyes going back, his face was turning a different color and Dr. Dobson began giving mouth-to-mouth.\u201d Players hustled back into the gym. Moline ran to the church office to dial for help \u2014 this was before cell phones. Hancock canvassed a near-empty campus looking for someone who knew CPR. The others gathered around Maravich and dropped to their knees. Some prayed, some wept. \u201cWe were pleading with God to not take Pete now because he had a platform, he was sharing his journey,\u201d Lydic said. A caravan followed the ambulance to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. Once there, the players bowed heads and held hands in the waiting room. It was just five minutes later, or maybe seven, when the doctor emerged. He didn\u2019t need to speak. The men already knew \u201cPistol Pete\u201d died not in an emergency room, but at church and on a basketball court, the twin sanctuaries where he felt most at peace. Someone called his home in Covington. His wife, Jackie, screamed. His two boys, Jaeson (then age eight) and Josh (five), were summoned from St. Peter\u2019s School unexpectedly and quickly. They arrived home to see 20 to 25 cars parked along the street. When told by their mother what happened, Jaeson ran upstairs, looked into the bathroom mirror and started crying. Josh, too young to comprehend what it all meant, just wanted to know when his dad was coming home so they could shoot on the Nerf hoop in the attic again. Somehow, despite yearly team physicals since high school, Maravich\u2019s congenital heart defect went undetected. He was born without a left coronary artery, which supplies blood to the muscle fibers of the heart, and the right artery, which had compensated for the imbalance, was overwhelmed. It was a medical miracle he lived 40 years and that millions of fans weren\u2019t deprived of a \u201cPistol Pete\u201d no-look pass thrown off the dribble with a flick of the wrist. James Dobson name-drops Maravich in speeches at conventions and on radio programs. Two years after Maravich died, Dobson suffered a minor heart attack in a pickup game, near the very same spot on the floor where Maravich collapsed. Norm Moline is sure he still has the original copy of the hazy video of Maravich\u2019s final minutes somewhere; he\u2019ll have to search for it, same as he did years ago for those Maravich cards which were never signed. Moline says until his recent divorce, the Maravich death was the worst day of his life. Drollinger said he was prepared psychologically for the Maravich death from his family\u2019s brush with near-tragedy years earlier. His father stumbled and fell deep in the Sierra Nevadas during a hike and a rescue-team helicopter crashed trying to save him; another was summoned and airlifted him just in time. \u201cWhat I took away from that day with Pete is, you never know, with the fragility of life, whether today will be my last day,\u201d he said. Lydic began a series of basketball camps in Maravich\u2019s memory, continuing a line of work that Maravich dabbled in post-retirement. Lydic\u2019s camp prioritized kids from single-parent households because \u201cPete\u2019s wife was now single with two boys.\u201d Parker Gymnasium at First Church of the Nazarene is unchanged. The hardwood stays polished and sunshine blasts through the windows at each end. There is nothing that indicates this is where Maravich spent his last breath. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come up often,\u201d said Melody Bundy, an executive assistant at the church. \u201cMost of the staff know what happened, but the number of people who were around that time is dwindling.\u201d The gym stays busy, used for a vast amount of events and serves as a multi-purpose space. Preschool activities are held weekly, plus day camps and other programs for children. Tuesday and Friday nights are reserved, though. That\u2019s for the men\u2019s pickup league. Games start early and can run late. It\u2019s a schedule that\u2019s gone uninterrupted since Pete Maravich collapsed. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Just as quickly, hoops pundits all over pounced on the notion that somehow \u2014 three games into it \u2014 the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 2020-21 campaign had disastrously come to an end, after the team announced Morant would miss three-to-five weeks recovering. \u201cWe\u2019re a team where it\u2019s next-man up. Guys are ready,\u201d Memphis guard Dillon Brooks said. \u201cWe play hard in practice, training camp. Guys are confident. We endorse confidence and competing. Our front office only gets guys that compete, want to play, and wait for the opportunity and seize it.\u201d Game 2 of the Grizzlies\u2019 current four-game homestand against the Los Angeles Lakers (5-2) on Tuesday presents yet another moment for Memphis to capitalize on in its fight for survival to advance to the playoffs for the first time since the 2016-17 season \u2014 and do so without the services of the reigning Kia NBA Rookie of the Year for the next several weeks. A three-week timeframe for Morant means the earliest he might return to the lineup is Jan. 20, when the Grizzlies face Portland ( 10 ET, NBA League Pass ) in a two-game series on the road. A five-week absence could shelve Morant until early February. Either way, Morant is expected to miss more than 10 games, which is considerable in this shortened 72-game season. It\u2019s not as if the Grizzlies aren\u2019t accustomed to operating shorthanded. \u201cI told the guys at the beginning of the season it\u2019s a one-day-at-a-time approach,\u201d Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. \u201cSeventy-two games in the regular season is a really long time, and we\u2019re building something just day after day. Being down a few guys, it\u2019s [a] next-man-up mentality. They just relish every opportunity to compete together.\u201d Memphis came into this season as the second-youngest squad in the NBA (24.3) behind the Minnesota Timberwolves, according to Elias Sports Bureau. With Jaren Jackson Jr. (knee) and Justise Winslow (hip) unavailable to start the season, the Grizzlies played their first three games with the starting lineup of Grayson Allen, Kyle Anderson, Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, Brooks and Morant. After Morant\u2019s injury at Brooklyn, Memphis replaced him two days later in the lineup with Tyus Jones. That night, Allen sprained his left ankle in a 126-107 loss at Boston and returned to play 15 minutes in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Lakers. Allen\u2019s absence paved the way for second-year man Brandon Clarke, who set an NBA rookie record among qualified players last season for field goal percentage (.618), to join the starting lineup. The new starting group of Clarke, Anderson, Brooks, Jones and Valan\u010di\u016bnas helped Memphis dial up 34 assists on 43 made field goals in a 108-93 win at Charlotte on New Year\u2019s Day, as Jones led the team with a season-high 12 dimes. \u201cIt was huge, really,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWhen you lose a player that\u2019s like Ja, there\u2019s some teams that really, really struggle afterwards because Ja was such a big part of our team. But we just kind of learned from those first two games [without Morant], and just learned how to play together. I think we had like 34 assists, which is really good. So, that just shows we were able to kind of figure it out and figure out how to play together, and still pass well without having Ja, one of the best passers I the league.\u201d The learning process continued Sunday in Memphis\u2019 108-94 loss to the Lakers. The Grizzlies jumped out to a 36-25 lead at the end of the opening frame, but the Lakers limited them to just 58 points over the next three quarters. Memphis started off hot, hitting 7 of 10 from deep, including 6 of 9 in the first quarter alone, as six different players drained 3-pointers. Memphis cooled considerably from long range over the next three quarters, connecting on just 12.5%. But with 3:42 left to play, the Grizzlies trailed by just five points (95-90), before Los Angeles embarked on a 10-0 run and put the game away on a Kyle Kuzma driving hook shot with 1:27 remaining. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way our guys fought,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cSecond and fourth quarter really hurt us, but you know we were neck-and-neck there for a majority of the game. It just came down some plays there in the fourth-quarter. They made some big shots. We could not get some shots to fall. Obviously, their pressure had a lot to do with it. We had some good moments where we made some great plays, just missed some shots. \u2026 For the most part, really proud of guys just stepping up.\u201d Through the growing pains, Memphis continues to flash signs of progress and depth that should prove beneficial down the stretch. After producing 18 points or more on just four occasions over 367 games over his first six NBA seasons, Anderson has racked up 18 points or more in three of the Grizzlies\u2019 first six games. \u201cJa makes the game a lot easier for everybody else out there,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut when we don\u2019t have him, we have to play with the pass, knock down open shots and find our teammates.\u201d Rookie Desmond Bane has connected on multiple 3-pointers in all six of Memphis\u2019 games, which registers as the second-longest streak to start a career in NBA history, behind Lauri Markkanen\u2019s 10-game streak in 2017. Bane is also averaging 13 points in his last three outings. \u201cAs I continue to get more comfortable and gain more experience, I\u2019ll get better,\u201d he said. \u201cI think experience is definitely the key right now.\u201d Valan\u010di\u016bnas, meanwhile, is in the midst of the franchise\u2019s second-longest points\/rebounds double-double streak to start a season, behind Zach Randolph\u2019s 11-game tear to start the 2012-13 season. Jones has dished 17 assists over his three starts in Morant\u2019s place with just two turnovers. Still, patience will be key for this young Memphis squad navigating the rugged Western Conference while awaiting the return of Morant as well as Jackson and Winslow, who still hasn\u2019t yet played a game for the Grizzlies since joining the team last February. De\u2019Anthony Melton played in the season opener against San Antonio but missed the next four games due to the league\u2019s \u201chealth and safety protocols\u201d. Melton was available for Sunday\u2019s game against the Lakers, but Jenkins wanted to take a cautious approach to bringing him back to action. After the matchup against the Lakers on Tuesday, the Grizzlies host the Cavaliers and Nets before hitting the road for a three-game trip starting at Cleveland and ending with a pair of games against the Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cNext man up,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWe just have to rely on our depth every single night, just play with competitiveness and unselfishness.\u201d * * * Michael C.

That memo, obtained by The Associated Press, was released on the same day the Brooklyn Nets ruled All-Star forward Kevin Durant out for Tuesday\u2019s game against Utah in accordance with the league\u2019s health and safety protocols for dealing with coronavirus. Among the new rules, which take effect Tuesday: players who are dressed for games and eligible to participate must wear a face mask until they enter the game, all players and coaches must wear face masks when outside the team environment if they are around other players and coaches, and players must report the names of any private trainer, therapist, chiropractor or other specialist who they work with outside of the team facility. It\u2019s the latest update to a plan the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are continuing to evaluate, especially lately given the continued uptick in cases following the holiday season. If players are working with trainers or therapists away from the team facility, they\u2019re also being reminded to wear masks and take all possible precautions. Meanwhile, a person with knowledge of the situation said Durant will have to complete a seven-day quarantine, which would also rule him out of three additional games \u2014 at home against Philadelphia on Thursday, at Memphis on Friday and home again to play Oklahoma City on Sunday. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Monday because the Nets did not disclose that publicly. Durant, who had coronavirus in May, tested negative in recent days, the person told AP. That would indicate Durant was exposed to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, based on the protocols the NBA and NBPA are using. ESPN and The Athletic first reported Durant would be entering quarantine and missing games. Durant is averaging 28.2 points over six games for the Nets, who are off to a 3-4 start. Regarding the updated mask rules, a player who comes out of a game is not required \u2014 but strongly recommended, the league said \u2014 to put on a mask after returning to the bench area. The rules reset at halftime; players who aren\u2019t in the game to start the third quarter need to wear masks until going into the game. Inactive players have been required to wear masks for the duration of the game, and that rule remains unchanged. Coaches are also mandated to wear masks while on the sideline, another rule that remains in place. The league also told teams Monday it has increased the maximum travel party size by one. It\u2019s now 46 people, the change being made so teams can add a staffer tasked with handling contact tracing requirements during road trips."},{"id":469602,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-guard-derrick-white-out-indefinitely-with-toe-fracture","date":"2021-01-05","title":"Spurs guard Derrick White out indefinitely with toe fracture","content":"San Antonio\u2019s backcourt depth will take a hit with the loss of Derrick White.

Jalen Brunson (DAL) vs. HOU: 4,500 With Luka Doncic out Sunday, Brunson scored 46.5 FD points across 37 minutes. Doncic could sit out Monday as well, and if he does, Brunson makes one of the best values on tonight\u2019s slate. Buddy Hield (SAC) vs. GS: 5,700 Hield should see increased run with Tyrese Haliburton out of action, and tonight\u2019s matchup with Golden State figures to be high-scoring with an over\/under of 232.5. Hield can heat up quickly, and he\u2019s got a great chance to do so in this one. Seth Curry (PHI) vs. CHA: 5,500 Curry has scored 21 points in back-to-back contests, and he\u2019s averaged 32.0 FD points across his last three. Curry is playing big minutes for Philly and is on a bit of a heater. Keep riding the hot hand into a favorable matchup with Charlotte tonight. Harrison Barnes (SAC) vs. GS: 6,100 Barnes has scored at least 30 FD points in each of his last three games, and he\u2019s hit the 40-point mark twice this season already. He\u2019s emerged as a primary offensive option for the Kings and could be in for another big game against Golden State in a contest that sports a 232.5 over\/under. Eric Gordon (HOU) vs. DAL: 5,300 Gordon has averaged 30.0 FD points in two appearances this season, and with James Harden a true GTD tonight, Gordon could see an expanded role in an excellent matchup. Darius Bazley (OKC) vs. MIA: 5,500 Coming off a season-high 39.4 FD points, Bazley\u2019s price hasn\u2019t shot up, and he makes a nice value at just $5.5K tonight. Miami has been a favorable matchup, and the young forward should be in line for around 30 minutes \u2013 his season average thus far. Bobby Portis (MIL) vs. DET: 4,700 Portis has averaged 25.1 FD points across 23.0 minutes this season, and there\u2019s a chance he sees plenty of playing time tonight in a game Milwaukee is favored by 13.5. Averaging over 1.0 FD point per minute, Portis makes a fine value tonight. JaVale McGee (CLE) vs. ORL: 4,700 Though McGee is logging just 17.5 minutes per night, he\u2019s averaged 24.8 FD points, good for 1.41 FD points per minute. That\u2019s excellent production for Cleveland\u2019s backup, and he\u2019s got a fine matchup with Orlando tonight.

And so are the first two weeks of this unusual season, with some eye-opening blowouts and some pretty fun games as well. With the singularity of this season, with rest days and protocol-related absences, we might look at these games as being less important than early January games in any other year. But because this season is shorter, they mean more. The one team that could probably cruise through the next few months, the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers, seem to be doing the opposite. The champs lost on ring night, they had a rough fourth quarter against Portland last Monday, and they probably could have stepped on the gas a little earlier in Memphis on Sunday. But the Lakers have generally been taking care of business. They built defensive habits early last season, and they\u2019re not thinking about flipping a switch in that regard this year. There are a bunch of new guys to incorporate into the program and it seems that steps won\u2019t be skipped. So the Lakers remain at No. 1 in this week\u2019s Power Rankings. The Clippers remain in the top five, but last week\u2019s No. 2, the Brooklyn Nets, have taken a tumble, replaced by a division rival that they\u2019ll face this week.

Curry went 18-for-31 from the field, 8-for-16 from beyond the arc and 18-for-19 from the free-throw line \u2026 that lone missed free throw snapped a streak of 80 straight. He also added five rebounds and four assists. He scored those 62 points in 36 minutes, and scored 30 points in both halves (a feat last accomplished by \u201cPistol\u201d Pete Maravich in 1977 ). It was a game that defined the skill that made Curry a game-changing player in the NBA. A handful of his 3-pointers came from well beyond the stripe, and his final shot, courtesy of a Draymond Green assist, was swished while off-balanced from deep. \u201cHe did a little bit of everything,\u201d said Blazers coach Terry Stotts. \u201cA great performance by a great player.\u201d The Warriors won 137-122 , which sweetened the performance by Curry, who has struggled at times this season and raised some suspicion about his ability to carry a team without a secondary scoring star. Discounting last season, Curry has enjoyed the company of Thompson for seven years, and also Kevin Durant for three of those seasons. Both players allowed the Warriors to not only win championships but stretch defenses and allow those shooters tremendous freedom. That was something mentioned by Damian Lillard moments after Portland beat the Warriors by 25 points in the first of their back-to-back games. \u201cI think right now, with the injuries that the Warriors have been dealing with and Steph playing with a younger team right now, he\u2019s seeing that it\u2019s tough to get those quality looks right now,\u201d Lillard said on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s different than what it\u2019s looked like over the last four or five years for him. He\u2019s trying to get quality looks and get a clean look, so he can make a good shot.\u201d Lillard meant no disrespect to Curry, a competitor he has always admired, but there was the ring of truth in what the Blazers guard said. Prior to his record-setting night, Curry was shooting at career lows from the floor and beyond the 3-point line in the first five games. Obviously that was a small sample size, but enough to give some observers pause about Curry being the lonesome star on a Warriors\u2019 team in transition. About the topic of a star carrying the load, Kerr applied some perspective and said: \u201cIf you think about most guys considered the best in the league, physical freaks of nature, LeBron, Giannis, Anthony Davis. Steph is 6-2, 180 pounds, whatever he is. He has to carry a game with skill, not physicality.\u201d Curry took the challenge Sunday and repeatedly and aggressively took it to the Blazers. If Thompson or Durant are on the court, Curry doesn\u2019t bother taking 31 shots. But this is a different time, and for one night, a different Curry from a historical standpoint. \u201cEverything was a shot or an attack,\u201d said Green. With the game somewhat competitive despite Curry\u2019s shooting, he wasn\u2019t pulled from the game, which meant more shots and more points, although Kerr did have a thought. \u201cI wanted to take him out with 30 seconds left, so the 42 people in the stands could give him a standing ovation,\u201d Kerr said. Then he added the obvious: \u201cIt\u2019s just a privilege to coach him.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Sure, Paul spent six tempestuous, teasing seasons with the Clippers from 2011-17, serving as floor general for a team that annually ranked near the top of the league in drama without ever getting beyond the Western Conference semifinals. But that was then, this is now. In a nod to how long four years in the NBA really is, not a single Clippers player remains from the roster Paul last played with in 2016-17. Only assistant Brendan O\u2019Connor is left from the coaching staff. So many of the big names with big personalities \u2014 Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Doc Rivers \u2014 have been scattered to the wind. Paul himself is thrice-removed from that L.A. bunch, one that maybe coulda and even shoulda, yet didn\u2019t. Now 35, he has left the Clippers, the Rockets and the Thunder in his wake to take over as the triggerman and resident old head for a young Phoenix Suns team looking to take a huge stride or two this season. Spinning forward from their 8-0 performance in the Orlando bubble last summer, the Suns became the first NBA team to reach five wins with their high-altitude, back-to-back victories Thursday and Friday, respectively, at Utah and at Denver. They\u2019re doing it with defense (stingiest in points allowed, second-best in shots allowed and defensive 3-point percentage). They\u2019re doing it with the development of youngsters Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges. They\u2019re doing it in coach Monty Williams\u2019 second season (Phoenix improved from 19 victories to 34 last season, in just 73 games). And they\u2019re doing it with a few key veteran acquisitions, including Jae Crowder and Cam Payne but none more significant than Paul. \u201cThe one thing about our team is, they\u2019ve seen Chris do this before,\u201d Williams said after Phoenix stiffened in time to beat the Nuggets Friday, 106-103. \u201cSo when you put the ball in his hands, they know what he\u2019s trying to do and to a degree they know what to expect.\u201d In blowing a fat lead yet rallying to win at Denver, Paul gave \u2014 and his Suns teammates witnessed \u2014 a tour de force closing performance. He scored eight of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, sure. But it was his nudge of Williams to challenge a foul call on Bridges with 31.2 seconds left that helped seal the deal for the Suns. That and the 15-foot step-back shot Paul hit to make it 104-100 with 7.3 seconds left. And the pair of foul shots he sank with 2.9 to go. It started with Paul encouraging Williams to question the foul against Gary Harris, who lost the ball attacking the basket as Bridges cut in front of him. Replays showed no actual contact, so Ayton met Nuggets center Nikola Jokic at midcourt for a jump ball \u2026 and won it, tipping the ball to Paul, naturally. \u201cI was thinking about our timeouts; you don\u2019t want to lose your timeouts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cUsually fouls aren\u2019t overturned. But we got eye contact and he\u2019s like, \u2018Coach, why not? Let\u2019s just go for it.\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s an asset to our team in many ways. That kind of gave us a swing there, to win the jump ball and get some points out of it and take some points off their board, really helps us win the game.\u201d Instead of Harris potentially hitting two free throws to tie at 102-102, Paul\u2019s jumper put the Suns up four points. His free throws were enough when Denver scrambled for a Jamal Murray 3-pointer that missed. The finish was a great example, in just his sixth game with a new team, of Paul imposing his will on events when it mattered most. As former teammate J.J. Redick recently said of him, \u201cWhen I think of Chris, I think of someone who is trying to manipulate every possession and squeeze the juice, so to speak, out of every single possession to gain an advantage.\u201d Paul\u2019s competitiveness, at 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, carries with it a Napoleonic whiff among the NBA\u2019s tall trees. And it\u2019s something that has rankled opponents, fans and even teammates at times. That\u2019s how it went, anyway, in the point guard\u2019s higher profile stops in Los Angeles and Houston. But now Paul is into a second consecutive season of image polishing and reputational restoration, freshening the look of a 10-time All Star who never has reached the Finals. In 16 seasons, with nine All-Defensive Team honors and as many All-NBA selections, Paul only has made it to a conference championship round once. But he opened eyes with his commitment and results last season in Oklahoma City, helping to turn the early stages of a rebuild into a productive playoff showing. Now Paul is showing by doing in Phoenix, imparting on-the-fly lessons to the team\u2019s brightest young stars with nothing less than a postseason berth in sight. Not of the play-in variety, either, if they can help it. \u201cI think we\u2019re building experiences together,\u201d Williams said late Friday. \u201cI think he and Devin are going to have some synergy as we go forward. Chris has done it over the course of his career \u2014 he\u2019s not afraid to make plays at the end of the game and he\u2019s not afraid to take those shots.\u201d Paul made it known as camp began that he wasn\u2019t on board merely to Yoda his tender teammates through the schedule. In his first Zoom media session, he said: \u201cEveryone always talks about what I can teach [Booker] or teach some of these other guys, but they\u2019re teaching me at the same time too. I\u2019m not James Naismith by no means. First things first, I\u2019m not just coming in here trying to teach everybody.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to tell how well the Suns\u2019 and their point guard\u2019s timelines will sync up. Paul has a player option worth $44 million for 2021-22, but if his play and the team\u2019s results both shine, he could be on the move again just as Booker, Ayton, Bridges and the rest are hitting their stride. For now, though, there\u2019s an unmistakable sense of ownership, even pride, in Paul\u2019s voice when he talks about the Suns\u2019 capacity to win and build at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you something: Win or lose this game, I already know who this team is,\u201d Paul said after Friday\u2019s victory. \u201cI know who every guy on this team is. I know what they\u2019re made of. I know the kind of energy they bring \u2026 Regardless of what happens night in and night out, I know what type of team we have and what each guy represents.\u201d * * *"},{"id":467706,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/danilo-gallinari-out-2-weeks-with-sprained-right-ankle","date":"2021-01-03","title":"Danilo Gallinari out 2 weeks with sprained right ankle","content":"Forward Danilo Gallinari underwent an MRI this morning at the Emory Sports Medicine Complex, which confirmed a right ankle sprain with associated swelling and inflammation.

He was 70. He died in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a statement from Southern California, where Westphal starred in college. He was diagnosed with brain cancer last August. A five-time All-Star guard, Westphal played in the NBA from 1972-84. After winning a championship with the Celtics, he made the finals in 1976 with Phoenix, where he was a key part of one of the most riveting games in league history. He also played for Seattle and the New York Knicks. He averaged 15.6 points, 4.4 assists and 1.9 rebounds during his career. After his playing career ended, Westphal moved into coaching. He led the Suns to the NBA Finals in 1993, and also was head coach of Seattle and Sacramento. He had stints as an assistant with Dallas and Brooklyn. \u201cThere may be just a handful of people who have as much influence and significance on the history of the Phoenix Suns,\u201d former team owner Jerry Colangelo said. \u201cAll he accomplished as a player and as a coach. Off the court, he was a gentleman, a family man, great moral character. He represented the Suns the way you want every player to represent your franchise.\u201d At the college level, Westphal coached at Southwestern Baptist Bible College (now Arizona Christian University), Grand Canyon and Pepperdine. Westphal played at USC from 1968-72, and the Trojans honored him with a moment of silence before their game Saturday. His No. 25 jersey hangs in the Galen Center rafters. He led the Trojans to a 24-2 record in 1971. The following year, he was an All-American and team captain who led the Trojans with a 20.3-point average. Born on Nov. 30, 1950, in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, Paul Douglas Westphal was drafted 10th overall in the first round of the 1972 NBA draft by the Celtics. The 6-foot-4 guard spent three seasons in Boston before being traded to Phoenix. In 1976, Westphal helped the Suns reach their first NBA Finals against the Celtics. Game 5, a triple-overtime thriller in that series, is often called \u201cthe greatest game ever played.\u201d The Suns trailed 94-91 in the closing seconds of regulation when Westphal stole the ball from JoJo White and got fouled. His 3-point play tied the game at 94. In the second overtime, with 15 seconds left and the Suns trailing 109\u2013108, Westphal stole the ball from John Havlicek, who had taken an inbounds pass. That led to a sequence in which the Suns scored to take a 110-109 lead. Havlicek scored with five seconds left to put the Celtics ahead 111\u2013110. The buzzer sounded and Celtics flooded the court, believing their team had won. However, the referee ruled that Havlicek scored with two seconds remaining. One second was put back on the clock. Westphal called for a timeout that the Suns didn\u2019t have, resulting in a technical foul. The Celtics made the free throw for a 112-110 lead. After a timeout, the Suns inbounded at midcourt and scored to force a third overtime. With 20 seconds left and the Celtics leading 128\u2013122, Westphal scored two quick baskets to cut it to 128\u2013126 and nearly stole the ball at midcourt, but failed and the Celtics ran out the clock to win. The Suns retired his No. 44 jersey. \u201cThroughout the past 40 years, Westy has remained a great friend of the organization and as a trusted sounding board and confidant for me,\u201d Suns manager partner Robert Sarver said . \u201cHis number 44 will forever hold its place in our Ring of Honor, enshrined as one of the utmost deserving members.\u201d Westphal returned to the Suns as an assistant in 1988. \u201cHe led by example,\u201d said Eddie Johnson, 1989 Sixth Man of the Year. \u201cHe didn\u2019t change off of the court.

He\u2019s averaging 30.6 points, 8.0 assists per game, and 45.9 fantasy points per game. He\u2019s a walking bucket and matched up with the young Cavs guards; Young could be looking at his second double-double of the season and last three games. Darius Garland (CLE) vs. ATL: 7,500 Darius Garland has been a surprise to the season, consistently outproducing his projected production. Garland has recorded three games of 37 or more fantasy points and currently recording 19.0 points and 7.2 assists per game. Atlanta is the middle of the pack when it comes to defending guards. Garland or Sexton are both good plays tonight and could once again outperform their projections. Markelle Fultz (ORL) vs. OKC: 5,800 Markelle Fultz averaged 21.0 points per game through three games to start the season and just 10.0 in the past two games. I see this matchup with OKC as a prime opportunity to get back into the scoring column and perhaps record his second double-double of the young season. The Thunder allow the ninth-most fantasy points per game (23.21) and the most assists per game (9.83). Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC) vs. ORL: 8,200 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is, interestingly enough, the best selection at shooting guard on this slate. He\u2019s recorded three games of 36 or more fantasy points per game but coming off his worst outing of the season with 22.8 fantasy points versus New Orleans. Before that, he\u2019s been a must-have in DFS and totaled at least 23 points and 7 assists in his first three games. Orlando is bottom 10 in allowed rebounds (30th) and assists (28th) to point guards. Collin Sexton (CLE) vs. OKC: 6,800 Collin Sexton has been tremendous this season, averaging 25.8 points per game for the Cavs. The only issue keeping him from being a premiere DFS option is his lack of assists (3.8) and rebounds (2.0). Sexton played 36 and 40 minutes in the last two games, and for the $700 less, Sexton is an alternative play to Garland. Both players are similar plays but comparing the two, Garland\u2019s all-around efforts make up for his lack of scoring. Eric Bledsoe (NOP) vs. TOR: 4,600 Eric Bledsoe has been a disappointment in DFS terms to start his Pelicans campaign. He posted his second-best outing with the Pelicans going for 25.1 fantasy points in his previous game with his second-most points scored (17). Versus Toronto last season, Bledsoe averaged 14.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in three meetings with the Bucks. I doubt he posts those numbers, but he could very well have a 20-point effort along with a few rebounds or assists each. Gordon Hayward (CHA) vs. PHI: 7,600 Gordon Hayward, the past two games have had a few pairs of eyes on him, and tonight could be no different. Versus Brooklyn, Hayward recorded 48.7 fantasy points, and in the last two combined, he\u2019s at 43.0. I predict this to be his best outing since the Nets game, and the 76ers aren\u2019t specifically great to bad at defending small forward to start the season ranking in the middle of the pack in nearly every category. Larry Nance Jr. (CLE) vs. ATL: 6,800 Larry Nance Jr. has had an excellent start to the season, and without Kevin Love, his role will continue to increase. Nance is becoming a double-double threat alongside Drummond, and with his passing ability, he becomes a quiet nightly option to triple-double. He\u2019s averaging 9.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 5.0 assists through five games and played 33 or more minutes in four of five contests. Nance is averaging 0.96 fantasy points per minute, and that\u2019ll likely increase over the next few weeks. Cam Reddish (ATL) vs. CLE: 4,900 Cam Reddish is a sleeper option but has put together three-consecutive impressive performances. Reddish has averaged 14.3 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 27.6 fantasy points per game during that stretch. Reddish has played 30 or more minutes in three of five games to start the season and has one turnover in four of five games, keeping him in the rotation. He\u2019s a decent play if you\u2019re digging deep. Zion Williamson (NOP) vs. TOR: 8,100 Zion Williamson has been impressive to start his sophomore year, and this matchup with the Raptors is a favorable one. Toronto allows the eighth-most fantasy points per game to power forwards (50.12) on the season, and Williamson is at 34.2 himself. He\u2019s yet to double-double over the last two games, and versus the Raptors\u2019 Pascal Siakam and Chris Boucher, I like his chances of breaking that streak. Aaron Gordon (ORL) vs. OKC: 6,400 Aaron Gordon is due for an increase in usage as Evan Fournier, and Terrence Ross could both miss time. Gordon had two 30-point plus fantasy point efforts in his first two games but yet to surpass 25 fantasy points in the last three games. Versus OKC, this is a good chance for him to get back to balling, and if they want to advance to 5-1, Gordon has to pick up his play versus a mediocre Thunder defense. Darius Bazley (OKC) vs. ORL: 5,500 Darius Bazely had two notable performances to open the season but has taken a step back over the last two. Bazely has registered 20 or more fantasy points in three of four games but failed to surpass seven points or assists in his previous two. Bazely recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds in the season-opener and 9 points and 11 rebounds in the second. Versus Orlando, he and Aaron Gordon will be an exciting matchup for both players, and they should both post similar numbers. Joel Embiid (PHI) vs. (CHA): 10,500 Joel Embiid has recorded at least 21 points and 9 rebounds in all his games this season, with a low of 40.8 fantasy points versus Orlando. That was a blowout, and his previous low is 47 fantasy points, so no matter how you chalk it up, he\u2019s suitable for 40-plus. Embiid has yet to score 30 points in a game this season, and I like this meeting to be the first. Nikola Vucevic (ORL) vs. OKC: 8,400 Nikola Vucevic\u2019s lowest fantasy output in 2020-21 is 35 fantasy points per game in the loss to Embiid and the 76ers, and Vuc\u2019s another center who can fill the stat sheet. The computer models give Vucevic yet another double-double and matched up with Al Horford; I\u2019ll take Vuc to lead the team in rebounds for the sixth-straight game and third-straight scoring. Bismack Biyombo (CHA) vs. PHI: 5,000 Bismack Biyombo is about as far as I\u2019d go down the center well tonight. He\u2019s averaging 10.6 points and 7.4 rebounds on the season and should have his hands full versus the 76ers. Biyombo\u2019s played at least 28 minutes in four-straight games and double-doubled in his last effort, 16 points and 12 rebounds for a season-high 36.4 fantasy points. I don\u2019t expect that again, but a 25-point DFS night is possible and likely. Read more from FantasyPros to help you prep your DFS lineups tonight.

Those words are rarely stitched together, because the calls traditionally made by the Kings wind up being the wrong number. Or a busy signal. Well, you get the idea. Essentially, the Kings\u2019 Draft history is rather putrid, and what makes this even more alarming is the team has selected in the lottery 14 straight years, some years with multiple first-round picks. How embarrassing is that? For the sake of context, consider the flipside: The Spurs, by virtue of reaching the playoffs 22 straight years (until last season) and therefore drafting outside the lottery, own a far more remarkable Draft track record. For every Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard and Dejounte Murray by San Antonio, there\u2019s a Nik Stauskas and Thomas Robinson and Jimmer Fredette and Georgios Pappagiannis by Sacramento. That seems almost accidental. The number of stars bypassed by the Kings in the Draft reads like a USA Olympic team: Klay Thompson, Devin Booker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker to name a few. In the dreaded 2016 draft, the Kings traded down from 8 to 13, missing Domantas Sabonis (11) in the process; used the 13 on Pappagiannis who was out of the NBA in three years; got the No. 22 pick in a trade and took Malachi Richardson and missed on Pascal Siakam (27); and used the No. 28 pick obtained in a trade on Skal Labissiere while Murray was taken with the very next pick by the Spurs. That\u2019s three first-rounders who, just four years later, are no longer with the Kings or in the league at the moment. And just to pile on, the Kings had the No. 2 overall pick just two years ago \u2026 and took Marvin Bagley III instead of Luka Doncic. This, despite the fact that Vlade Divac, the GM at the time, knew extensively about Doncic ever since the player was just into his teens and had better intel than anyone else. That\u2019s largely why Divac is now the former GM. But now, the Kings are ecstatic, if understandably somewhat tempered, about the promise of Tyrese Haliburton. One player cannot erase a history, but he can cause some amnesia, and that\u2019s what the Kings and their fans are hoping from Haliburton. Here in the very early stages of the season, Haliburton has not only shown he\u2019s an NBA player \u2014 hey, it\u2019s a low bar for the Kings after that 2016 draft \u2014 but his game is more mature and polished than most rookies. In quick time, the No. 12 pick has earned the trust of coach Luke Walton and a place in a three-guard rotation with De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield that has the Kings feeling confident about the present and future of their backcourt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound arrogant, but I worked for this, so I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you I\u2019m surprised or anything like that,\u201d Haliburton said. Curiously, Haliburton was expected to go higher in the Draft, and when he fell to the Kings \u2026 there had to be a reason why, right? So right away, the situation was cloudy and somewhat familiar in Sacramento. Either the Kings had a steal, or this was another Justise Winslow situation (Heat, 10th pick, 2015), where a highly regarded player dropped and \u2026 in hindsight was taken right where he belonged. Haliburton came with a funky shot release that probably frightened some teams, and his 175 pounds on a 6-foot-5 frame doesn\u2019t scream a body that\u2019s NBA-ready. Although he did beat out Tyler Herro for the Mr. Basketball title in Wisconsin, he lacked a rich basketball history as a star. Yet: Haliburton\u2019s ball-handling skills are a bit better than expected, his elbows-out shot is falling with impressive accuracy, and his basketball IQ allows him to make solid decisions with the ball (only four turnovers in 135 minutes). \u201cHe plays beyond his years and we all have the utmost confidence in him with the ball,\u201d Fox said. \u201cHe steps up to the occasion. He understands the game so well \u2026 you would have thought he\u2019s played a few years already.\u201d Haliburton is shooting 53% from the field, 87% from the free-throw line and making half his 3-pointers. There\u2019s also the eye test, where Haliburton simply fits into the flow of the game and the system, rarely forcing anything, moves well off screens and without the ball and glides into his spots. He\u2019s averaging 10.6 points and 4.4 assists, both top-five among NBA rookies, in 26 minutes per game while getting touches at point guard and off the ball. With Fox bringing speed and Hield supplying the deep shots, Haliburton is contributing a mix of both and meshing well with those starters. The Kings are also encouraged by his presence in tight games. So far, Haliburton is the only NBA rookie to score during clutch time \u2014 a period during the last five minutes of a game that\u2019s within five points. He had some takeover moments late in the win over the Nuggets. Against the Rockets on Thursday, Haliburton broke free for an open and clean 3-pointer (and then had words for the Rockets\u2019 bench) in the final moments to create comeback suspense in a game the Kings eventually lost. During that game, he fell hard and grabbed his wrist, which initially was a concern because Haliburton hurt his wrist at Iowa State. (Update: An MRI revealed a left wrist bone bruise for Haliburton. He will be reevaluated next week). These are somewhat desperate times for the 3-2 Kings, if only because they own the longest playoff drought in the NBA. This is a franchise that craves and needs stability and more signs of prosperity. Monte McNair is now in charge of the operation and the ex-Rockets front office man is off to a solid start, Draft-wise anyway. Walton had difficulty once arriving as coach last season and the Kings once again failed to make the postseason. Several times in the last decade, the Kings gave positive signals that turned out to be false. Players came and went and superstars never materialized. Most of all, high Draft picks fizzled, and anyone searching for reasons why the Kings have floundered for so long can start right there. Tyrese Haliburton can\u2019t change history, but if the rookie is bringing more of what we\u2019ve seen, then he can impact the future. \u201cMy whole life, I\u2019ve just wanted to be the best version of myself and obviously, as a kid, I\u2019ve always wanted to be the best player in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those are obviously my aspirations.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Raul Neto (WAS) vs. MIN: 4,500 Neto should be in the starting lineup for Washington tonight, and he was red hot in that position earlier in the week. He scored 41.3 FD points against Orlando on Sunday with Russell Westbrook (rest) out, and he makes a tremendous value on Friday\u2019s slate. Monte Morris (DEN) vs. PHO: 4,000 Morris has averaged just a hair under 30 FD points across his last three, including 39.2 against Sacramento on Tuesday as a starter. If Jamal Murray (elbow) is ruled out again, expect Morris to get another start and smash value at his ridiculously-cheap price tag. D\u2019Angelo Russell (MIN) vs. WAS: 7,500 D-Lo hasn\u2019t been a great DFS play thus far, but he gets a Wizards\u2019 team surrendering the most FD points to opposing shooting guards, and at just $7.5K, he\u2019s a huge value in a possible blowup spot. Caris LeVert (BKN) vs. ATL: 6,500 Even off the bench, LeVert has big-time upside, and tonight\u2019s high-scoring matchup with Atlanta is one to take advantage of, especially at $6.5K. If you want to pivot from Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, LeVert makes a nice play. Rui Hachimura (WAS) vs. MIN: 5,000 Hachimura made his season debut Thursday against the Bulls and poured in 28.5 FD points across 25 minutes of play. He\u2019s got a favorable matchup with Minnesota tonight, and without Russell Westbrook in the lineup, Hachimura could see some additional work on offense. Bogdan Bogdanovic (ATL) vs. BKN: 5,400 Atlanta\/Brooklyn has the highest over\/under on the slate at 245 1\/2, so this is a matchup to target. Bogdanovic comes in at a very affordable $5.4K, and he\u2019s scored better than 31 FD points in each of his last two games. With Danilo Gallinari already ruled out, BB makes a fine play tonight. Thaddeus Young (CHI) vs. MIL: 3,700 Young made his season debut Thursday and went for 31.6 FD points in 27 minutes off the bench. With Lauri Markkanen (health protocols) out again, expect Young to play meaningful minutes and return plenty of value at just $3.7K. Robert Covington (POR) vs. GS: 5,400 RoCo has failed to return much value this season, but in Portland\u2019s two competitive games, he\u2019s played at least 37 minutes in each. The matchup with Golden State is one to target with one of the highest over\/unders on the slate, and despite some early-season miscues, Covington could be a value play at his current price if he sees big minutes. Thomas Bryant (WAS) vs. MIN: 5,800 Bryant\u2019s production has ramped up as of late, and he scored a season-best 42.6 FD points against Chicago on Thursday. He\u2019s got another excellent matchup with Minnesota on deck, and without Russell Westbrook in the lineup, expect Bryant\u2019s role on offense to expand in this one. "},{"id":464689,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/can-stephen-curry-thrive-as-a-solo-star","date":"2021-01-01","title":"Can Stephen Curry thrive as a solo star?","content":"The ball was tossed his way and he tossed it right back, only higher and softer and straighter. This went on for what, five, six minutes? Stephen Curry caught passes in practice earlier this week from Bruce Fraser, the Warriors\u2019 assistant coach and long-time Curry ball retriever, and made 3-pointer after 3-pointer. It was clearly a contest to see whose arm would tire first: Curry\u2019s, Fraser\u2019s, or the one filming. As you surely know by now, Curry made 105 3s in a row before, as Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, he \u201cchoked\u201d on 106. It was a marvelous display of fundamental shooting, rhythm and concentration, except now comes the hard part for Curry. Because, what\u2019s the bigger and more difficult challenge, making all those 3s in a row, or restoring the Warriors without a shooting co-star? In years past, Curry could always count on having like-minded company both at shooting practice and at games. Klay Thompson and Curry regularly conducted \u201cshootouts\u201d at the Warriors\u2019 workout facility, often long after teammates had showered. And of course, the two conspired to shoot down opponents on the floor, where together, they were the finest shooting backcourt in NBA history. And for three bonus seasons, Curry also had Kevin Durant, a former Kia MVP and four-time scoring champion, around to add more flavor to those shooting contests and most importantly, draw defenses away from Curry and make life easier. But now, as a singular star, Curry is alone on an island, with Thompson recovering from his second major leg injury and Durant in Brooklyn with the Nets. Given this change of fortune, the basketball culture gets to see how Curry adjusts to a reality he hadn\u2019t experienced since his first few years in the league, well before his reputation and expectations soared. As he warned us recently: \u201cThis year\u2019s different.\u201d This seems an awkward topic to raise about a two-time MVP and three-time champion; however: Is Curry, now working solo, good enough to haul the Warriors to the highest levels of the NBA? The factors working against him: NBA history, and also the competition he and the Warriors are facing in yet another stacked season for the Western Conference. The history part is cruel, especially against smallish guards. Allen Iverson in 2001 was an outlier as he took the Sixers to The 2001 Finals, where they were overmatched against the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal-led Lakers. Otherwise, no normal-sized guard has ever come close to that success, not without All-Star help. And anyway, asking Curry to lead the Warriors back to The Finals this season, after a two-year absence and without Thompson and\/or Durant, seems unrealistic and unfair. The most ambitious scenario has Curry and the Warriors returning to the playoffs, and even that comes without guarantees. There are simply too many variables and too much unpredictability in the rotation, coupled with a conference thick with good teams, that\u2019ll make even a postseason journey an adventure. There are some harsh critics who might take it a bit further and suggest this season will serve as a statement about Curry\u2019s true greatness. If, for example, the Warriors fall into the lottery for the second straight year \u2014 this time with a healthy Curry \u2014 would that be a blow to Curry\u2019s reputation? Shouldn\u2019t the game\u2019s all-time all-around shooter and two-time MVP be good enough, even at age 32, to lead his team at least to the playoffs? Those questions will be answered in time. Meanwhile, Curry is by far the most accomplished and proven option on the Warriors, with all due respect to Draymond Green (who is expected to make his season debut Friday after missing the first four games with a foot injury). Already, defenses have adjusted and pounced on the opportunity to throw traps and double-teams at Curry, strategies that would\u2019ve been costly in the past with Thompson and Durant around. But now? Curry is averaging 26.5 ppg and 7.0 assists, but he isn\u2019t enjoying the same freedom as before. He\u2019s shooting just 41.3% overall and 31.5% on 3-pointers, meaning he\u2019s forced to work harder for his shot. Yes, it\u2019s a small sample size, so no need to jump to any quick conclusions, yet those are alien to a player with career shooting marks of 47.6% and 43.4%, respectively. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse, just for what my expectations for myself and shots that I take I always think I\u2019m going to make,\u201d Curry said about the rough shooting. \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2014 maybe one or two of them I would call bad shots. The rest of them I was confident in and ones that I feel I can make. And it\u2019s just a matter of sticking with the program.\u201d Unlike the historic moment he spent at practice hoisting that record number of 3-pointers, there are multiple defenders in Curry\u2019s grill when the game starts. The teammates that surround him are, for the most part, dealing with transition and it was uncomfortable early. Kelly Oubre, an athletic swingman, is playing for a stable and winning franchise for the first time in his career. Same for Andrew Wiggins, who\u2019s also \u2014 still \u2014 dealing with the outsized expectations stemming from his No. 1 overall Draft status and his massive contract, both of which are swallowing him up. Then there\u2019s James Wiseman, the rookie center who\u2019s showing teases of being very good, but again, there\u2019s plenty of games and growing experiences that lie ahead. Oubre has missed 20 of his 21 shots from deep as he struggles to fill the Thompson role and stretch the floor. Wiggins is once again bedeviled by lapses of inactivity and costly disappearances. Wiseman, while off to an impressive start, isn\u2019t commanding high-alert respect from opposing defenses just yet. \u201cWe\u2019re learning and growing,\u201d Curry said. \u201cMostly just because of different personnel and that\u2019s OK right now. We\u2019re learning and growing so I think you got to be honest with yourself. Around the first two games it was terrible and disjointed. As we continue to grow week to week we can add a little bit. We just have to make sure our effort and competitiveness is there, and that will help us get through these early growing pains \u2026 it will come.\u201d The work for the Warriors begins when Curry surrenders the ball. There\u2019s almost 10 points separating Curry from the Warriors\u2019 second leading scorer this season, a drop-off that might continue the entire season. It\u2019s an imbalance that Curry has never seen with the Warriors, even in the early days when at least he had Monta Ellis around. In that sense, Curry could find himself in a similar place as James Harden, pre-Chris Paul and pre-Russell Westbrook \u2026 and Westbrook in his MVP season after Durant left OKC \u2026 and Derrick Rose in his MVP season in Chicago. Those high-scoring and overloaded guards, lacking a dangerous shotgun rider, managed to lead their teams to the playoffs. Those examples would be reasonable standards for Curry in 2020-21. It\u2019s an interesting basketball phase for Curry. He has two more years on a max contract that he\u2019d like to see extended after he turns 35, always a tricky age for players not named LeBron James. He won\u2019t have Thompson until next season, and even then, nobody knows what to expect from a player who\u2019s had surgery to repair a knee and Achilles. Also, if Warriors\u2019 ownership is spoiled by all those championship runs, will there be wholesale changes if the Warriors struggle this season and next? Those are issues for the future. For now, Curry must reach a comfort zone between a golden era that produced three titles, and a more tempered reality caused by a crucial missing player and the simple fact that great moments don\u2019t last very long, not in today\u2019s NBA. As Kerr mentioned often during the Warriors\u2019 championship runs, they weren\u2019t living in the real NBA world. Just as the NBA is about to learn a lot about the transitional Warriors, there\u2019s also lots to learn about their star, now riding solo, caught up in this new and barely familiar basketball life. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

That may likely be the sentiment wafting through the streets in Houston after its 122-119 win against the Sacramento Kings, as we all finally witnessed Thursday how James Harden would mesh with the team\u2019s new pieces in their first game together. \u201cIt was just a grind-it-out, tough, find-a-way-to-win game,\u201d Rockets coach Stephen Silas said, \u201cand luckily we have the players that are able to do it.\u201d Houston didn\u2019t for its first two games with COVID-19 protocols postponing the season opener, and pushing John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Eric Gordon (and Mason Jones) into seven-day quarantines. That left the Rockets to sputter out the gates to an 0-2 start. Harden averaged 39 points in those contests, with Christian Wood averaging 27 ppg for a team barely able to fulfill even minimum roster requirements to play an NBA game. So, the underlying smile printing through Silas\u2019 grey mask made plenty of sense after the game. Having captured his first victory as an NBA coach, Silas finally presided over a near-complete Rockets squad playing its first game together that flashed the start of a potentially bright future with one of the league\u2019s most lethal scorers (Harden) headlining a scrappy group with something to prove. The grit was evident in Thursday night\u2019s game that featured 19 lead changes. \u201cOnce we get a rhythm and guys get into their roles, and find out the best fit for the team, we\u2019ll be even better,\u201d Harden said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy for in the last six minutes when it was time to get stops, we did. Then offensively, we executed.\u201d With 3:48 left to play, De\u2019Aaron Fox knocked down a pair of free throws to put Sacramento up by four points. From there, Houston outscored the Kings 16-9 with Harden pouring in 14 of his 16 fourth-quarter points during the run. In fewer than three minutes, Houston embarked on a 12-2 run paced by Harden racking up 10 points and dishing an assist to Wood for the other bucket. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable, man,\u201d Wood said of Harden. \u201cWhat he does on the floor, the way he operates, it\u2019s crazy. I couldn\u2019t really explain it to you. I don\u2019t really know what James Harden\u2019s ceiling is. Playing with him, he makes me look great. I\u2019m gonna keep setting as many picks for him as I can.\u201d Harden would finish with a game-high 33 points to go with eight assists, while Wall \u2014 playing in his first game in more than two years \u2014 contributed 22 points and nine dimes. Wood added 21 points, 12 rebounds and two blocked shots, and Danuel House Jr. chipped in 11 points. Starting power forward P.J. Tucker didn\u2019t attempt a shot or score a point, but he shined on defense with critical stops, three steals and a pair of blocked shots to go with six rebounds. \u201cVery impressed,\u201d Silas said. \u201cWe were kind of in and out of the game. We had our highs and our lows keeping our composure, fighting back, dealing with adversity and all of those things we did tonight, and we came up with a win. James obviously was great down the stretch. P.J. Tucker made some huge plays. That last group was really good; John Wall, obviously.\u201d Defending Fox most of the night, Wall limited him to 3-for-8 shooting and seven points as Fox finished with 22 points on 9-for-23 shooting. \u201cWe have a lot of veteran guys, and we have some guys that are superstars in this league,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found ways to try to get better with each other because I\u2019m used to certain things being from my old team. James is used to things being a way with him, and then DeMarcus being where he was at. So, we\u2019re just trying to figure out game by game. We all just try to be positive. \u201cWe tell ourselves if we go through a drought, we turn the ball over or don\u2019t make shots, don\u2019t get down on ourselves or try to do it individually. Just stay together as a group. I think we did a great job of that because there was a point, I think, in the fourth quarter we were up, they came back and took the lead. We could\u2019ve just folded there. But we kept making runs and getting stops.\u201d Houston\u2019s bench contributed, too, as Gordon (17 points on 50% shooting) led all reserves in scoring en route to the Rockets\u2019 backups outscoring the Kings\u2019 35-28. Playing in his first regular-season game since April 9, 2019, Cousins scored eight points on 3 of 5 shooting (1-for-2 on 3-pointers) while contributing three assists. Interestingly, Harden, Wall and Cousins own a combined 17 NBA All-Star appearances. That\u2019s more firepower at Harden\u2019s disposal than he ever experienced in his first eight seasons paired unsuccessfully in separate instances with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. That\u2019s not even accounting for sign-and-trade gem Wood. He has proven to be a monster over the first three games in pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop situations, possessing the range to shoot 40% from deep this season, not to mention the defensive versatility to guard on the perimeter. Then there\u2019s the depth featuring Sterling Brown, consummate hustler Jae\u2019Sean Tate, Gordon, Ben McLemore and David Nwaba. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling the media before that the sky\u2019s the limit for this team. This is our first game all together,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI liked the way we played. We came with great energy. Guys were clicking, and we\u2019ve just got to keep it up. I love it man. I\u2019m happy to be here in Houston.\u201d But is Harden, even after all the feel-good vibes emanating from Thursday\u2019s showing? It\u2019s well documented that Harden has reportedly requested a trade from Houston, with the Philadelphia 76ers, Miami Heat, Brooklyn Nets, Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics reportedly lining up as potential suitors. Harden certainly wasn\u2019t showing his hand when speaking matter-of-factly regarding the new supporting cast expected to alleviate the pressure on him. \u201cThey did a really good job,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThey were very aggressive throughout the course of the game; didn\u2019t stop. We need that from top to bottom. It\u2019s gonna be very, very important. That\u2019s what makes a complete team.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Cameron Payne (PHO) vs. UTA: 4,700 Payne has scored at least 21 FD points in three of his last four outings, including totals of 25.9 and 28.0 in his last two. He\u2019s played important minutes for Phoenix\u2019s second unit and should continue to do so in a favorable matchup with Utah tonight. Elfrid Payton (NYK) vs. POR: 5,200 Don\u2019t look now but Payton has averaged 20.5 points, 7.0 assists, and 5.5 rebounds across his last two games, averaging over 35.0 FD points in the process. He\u2019s got a great matchup with Toronto and comes very reasonably priced. Tyrese Haliburton (SAC) vs. HOU: 4,900 Haliburton has gotten his NBA career off to a hot start, and he\u2019s averaged 23.8 FD points across four games, including a season-best 32.6 FD points Tuesday against Denver. The matchup between the Kings and Rockets easily has the highest over\/under on the slate at 229.5, and Haliburton should have plenty of opportunities to smash at this price point. Reggie Bullock (NYK) vs. TOR: 3,600 Bullock logged his best game of the season Tuesday, going for 17 points and seven boards across 40 minutes while scoring 28.4 FD points. Bullock drew a start thanks to the absence of Alec Burks, and Burks is considered a GTD tonight. If Burks is out, Bullock makes a highly-valuable play at just $3.6K. Cameron Johnson (PHO) vs. UTA: 4,400 Johnson is coming off his best game of the season (29.4 FD points), and he\u2019ll look to build on that momentum in tonight\u2019s matchup with Utah. The second-year man is averaging 24.1 FD points through four games, thanks in large part to 2.5 triples on 40.0 percent shooting from downtown. Mikal Bridges (PHO) vs. UTA: 5,800 Bridges has met his new starting role head on, posting solid numbers while logging over 30 minutes per contest. He\u2019s averaged 30.2 FD points and comes in as a value with a salary under $6K. Bojan Bogdanovic (UTA) vs. PHO: 4,900 Bogdanovic is arguably the best value on the slate this evening, as he\u2019s averaged just under 26.0 FD points through three games. He\u2019s always a threat to heat up from three, and the sub-$5K price tag is one to exploit in a great matchup with Phoenix. Royce O\u2019Neale (UTA) vs. PHO: 3,800 O\u2019Neale has posted at least 20 FD points in each of his last two games, and he\u2019s averaging over 30 minutes per contest this season. This is more of a GPP play, but if you\u2019re looking for plenty of minutes at a rock-bottom price, O\u2019Neale is your man. Chris Boucher (TOR) vs. NY: 5,900 New York has hemorrhaged points to opposing centers this season, and whoever gets primary run at that position for Toronto could be in for a big game. After two solid showings (including a 22\/10\/7 performance), Chris Boucher was given just four minutes Tuesday against the 76ers. It\u2019s possible this was just based on matchup, and if he can see minutes in the low-to-mid 20s tonight, he could smash value. Richaun Holmes (SAC) vs. HOU: 5,300 Holmes\u2019 production has increased in each game thus far, surging to 38.5 FD points scored against the Nuggets on Tuesday. The big man hasn\u2019t seen his numbers dwindle with Hassan Whiteside in the rotation, and Holmes could be in line for another big day against a Houston defense that has been extremely kind to opposing centers.

I got traded here in 2007. So, I\u2019ve been in San Antonio and part of the Spurs and sports organization with the Stars and everything for 14 years. I have a lot of time invested, and they have a lot of time invested in me in building me and getting me better.\u201d Hammon filled in for Popovich when official Derek Richardson ejected the veteran coach with 3:56 left in the second quarter , after he received a pair of technical fouls for arguing a no-call with officials on a play that involved DeMar DeRozan driving to the basket for an attempted layup. With assistant coach Will Hardy attempting to restrain him, Popovich walked toward the court yelling at Richardson just before he was whistled for the technical fouls and subsequent ejection. Hammon immediately took over, walking the sideline, drawing up plays and calling the Spurs\u2019 timeouts. San Antonio\u2019s players saw Hammon\u2019s resumption of Popovich\u2019s duties simply as business as usual. \u201cBecky has definitely been instrumental for us every time we step out there on the court, even in timeouts with Pop as the head coach,\u201d Spurs forward DeMar DeRozan said. She\u2019s quick on her feet, understanding defensive coverages, where we should be offensively, what we should run, different mismatches. Her words on the side are always instrumental. Seeing her at the forefront, [it] definitely would have been cool if we would have pulled that [game] out for her.\u201d Nominated for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2021, Hammon is the first full-time female assistant coach in NBA history. A three-time All-American at Colorado State, Hammon played for the New York Liberty and the San Antonio Stars of the WNBA in addition to competing overseas before retiring in 2014 and joining Popovich\u2019s staff that August. As a player with the Stars, Hammon suffered a torn left ACL in July of 2013. During her rehabilitation from that injury, Hammon spent extensive time attending Spurs practices and coaches\u2019 meetings, where she quickly caught the eye of Popovich, who spoke glowingly about the assistant coach prior to Thursday\u2019s loss to the Lakers. \u201cWell, obviously, I think very much of her abilities having hired her,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThat all began when I saw her play. She was a leader. Everybody on the team reacted to her. She was very confident, very competitive, and she led the whole show. When I got to know her and she was in our coaches\u2019 meetings before she was hired, while she was hurt that first season, I found out about her knack for the game; her innate understanding of what wins, what loses, what has to be there to make a program. So, she\u2019s got all the tools necessary to be a heck of a coach in our league.\u201d Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray agreed. \u201cI\u2019m a player, she\u2019s a coach. I think she has the knowledge,\u201d said Murray, who finished Thursday\u2019s game with a career-high 29 points to go with seven rebounds and seven assists. \u201cI think she knows the game really well. But it\u2019s up to her if she really, really wants it. If she wants it, I believe she could do it. \u201cShe\u2019s passionate about the game, she\u2019s passionate about winning. She knows everything about it. So, if she does [become a head coach permanently] or if she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m gonna love her the same and appreciate her the same. The future is bright for her. I hope she sticks to it and doesn\u2019t give up. One day it may happen, or it may not happen. Who knows? But she\u2019s definitely on the right road, and I think everyone here appreciates her.\u201d \u201cBecky Hammon is an enormously talented coach and it was outstanding to see her reach such a truly significant milestone,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cShe continues to be an inspiration to so many people, especially countless young women and girls. Kudos to Becky on this well-deserved achievement and to Pop and the Spurs organization for leading the way.\u201d Popovich was ejected last season during a Nov. 16 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and missed a contest in Charlotte last March to attend to personal business. In both of those instances, former Spurs Hall of Fame power forward Tim Duncan took over at the helm for Popovich. Duncan opted against returning to the Spurs\u2019 coaching staff this season, leaving Hammon as San Antonio\u2019s top assistant. \u201cAny player or anybody who knows the history of women\u2019s basketball, what she meant to the sport, having her around, you don\u2019t think twice about it,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cShe fits right in. It feels like one of us, honestly. It\u2019s great to have that. Whenever she speaks, we listen. We\u2019re all ears. Since I\u2019ve been here, it\u2019s been great just having her.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

James\u2019 baby hook shot with 6:15 left in the second quarter in San Antonio gave him 11 points for the game, marking the 1,000th straight game scoring in double-digits, a milestone that will be difficult to match. He already owns the longest streak in NBA history \u2014 surpassing Michael Jordan\u2019s mark of 866 games on March 30, 2018 \u2014 and he continues to extend the record every time he takes the court. The last time LeBron failed to score 10 points in a game was on Jan. 5, 2007 , when he had eight points, nine assists and five rebounds as the Cavs beat the Bucks. He has eight single-digit scoring games in his career, with six of them coming in 2003-04 (his rookie season). Remember, this streak accounts for regular season games only. James does have a pair of single-digit playoff games \u2014 in 2011 and 2014 when he was on the Miami Heat. Adding those to his regular-season single-digit games total brings James to 10, which accounts for less than 1% (0.654% to be exact) of his 1,529 career games (regular season and playoffs combined). As he has ascended the all-time scoring lists in the regular season (No. 3) and playoffs (No. 1) , it is James\u2019 scoring consistency that separates him from other NBA greats past and present. This looming 1,000-game streak of double-digit scoring is the latest example of that consistency. LeBron averaged 25.3 ppg last season, which was 12th in the NBA and second on the Lakers to Anthony Davis (26.1 ppg, 10th in NBA ). It took until his 17 th season for LeBron to not be his team\u2019s leading scorer in a given season. What he did instead was lead the league in assists for the first time in his career (with a career-best 10.2 apg). While his team-scoring-leader streak was snapped, he did extend another remarkable streak as he averaged more than 25 ppg for the 16 th consecutive season . After averaging 20.9 ppg as a rookie, LeBron has never averaged fewer than 25 ppg in a season. That is the longest streak in league history by a wide margin. The next closest players are Hall of Famers Karl Malone and Michael Jordan with 11 straight seasons (and that\u2019s if we include Jordan\u2019s 1994-95 comeback season when he played only 17 games). LeBron is not the pure scorer that Jordan was during his prime. Jordan won a record 10 scoring titles, while LeBron has one. Jordan also has the highest scoring average in league history at 30.1 ppg, while LeBron\u2019s 27.1 career ppg ranks fourth. But when it comes to longevity and consistency, LeBron holds the advantage over any of the all-time greats. Looking spry as he begins his 18 th season, there\u2019s no indication his double-digit scoring streak will end anytime soon. How far can he push it and how long will it take for anyone to have a realistic shot at challenging his mark? Since the 1983-84 season, there have only been nine streaks of at least 300 straight double-digit scoring performances. That list includes only two active streaks \u2014 LeBron at 999 and James Harden at 411. When we look at active streaks, there are only six players who exceed 75 consecutive double-digit scoring games entering Wednesday\u2019s games. After Harden, the next longest active streak belongs to Kevin Durant (152 games), followed by Kawhi Leonard (125), Karl-Anthony Towns (113) and Bradley Beal (109). Add those five together (910) and it would still not be enough to match LeBron\u2019s streak. Among the players with the longest active streaks, Harden likely has the best chance to challenge LeBron. Harden is the league\u2019s preeminent scorer, having led the league in scoring in each of the past three seasons. However, he trails LeBron by 588 games \u2014 the equivalent of more than seven full 82-game seasons. Plus, LeBron isn\u2019t stopping at 1,000 games. That means this mark will keep rising, making it all the more difficult for anyone to challenge."},{"id":463816,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/longtime-pacers-executive-donnie-walsh-announces-retirement","date":"2020-12-30","title":"Longtime Pacers executive Donnie Walsh announces retirement","content":"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Longtime Indiana Pacers executive Donnie Walsh, the architect of the franchise\u2019s turnaround, announced his retirement on Wednesday. The 79-year-old Walsh first told The Indianapolis Star of his intention to retire. \u201cOver my 30-year relationship with Donnie, I have been amazed to watch him help lead this organization to what it has become,\u201d team owner Herb Simon said in a statement. \u201cHe was certainly the right leader at the right time, and the invaluable wisdom and counsel he has provided over the decades extend well beyond the lines of the basketball court.\u201d Walsh came to Indiana as an assistant coach in 1984, joining a franchise that had never won a playoff game during its NBA history. Two years later, Walsh was promoted to general manager. He made his biggest splash in 1987, defying the wishes of a basketball-crazed state to pass on high school and college star Steve Alford to select Reggie Miller. It didn\u2019t take Miller long to turn the draft-night boos into cheers. Walsh continued building the Pacers with solid Draft picks and shrewd moves. Indiana won its first playoff game in 1987, its first playoff series in 1994 and after reaching the Eastern Conference finals four times between 1994 and 1999, the Pacers finally won the 1999-2000 conference crown. But the Los Angeles Lakers won the championship in six games. Eventually, Walsh was given the titles of CEO and team president, which he held until leaving to return to his hometown, New York, as the Knicks\u2019 president of basketball operations. Walsh resigned as New York\u2019s decision-maker in June 2011 but continued to serve as a consultant with the Knicks for one more year. In June 2012, the Pacers brought back Walsh as president of basketball operations, succeeding Larry Bird. When Bird returned to the team a year later, Walsh continued to work as a consultant. \u201cI owe him an incredible debt of gratitude,\u201d Simon said. \u201cWhile he may be stepping away, Donnie will always be part of the Pacers family and I am personally excited for him as he transitions to his next chapter.\u201d Walsh played at North Carolina for coach Frank McGuire and was a senior captain on Dean Smith\u2019s first team in 1961-62. He was drafted by the San Francisco Warriors in 1962 but never played in the NBA, choosing instead to start a coaching career that included 12 years as McGuire\u2019s assistant at South Carolina. Denver Nuggets coach Larry Brown hired Walsh as an assistant in 1977, and Walsh was promoted to coach during the 1978-79 season. Walsh went 60-82 before he was replaced by Doug Moe just 31 games into the 1980-81 season. Walsh spent one more season in Denver as an assistant before heading to Indiana."},{"id":463764,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-wall-demarcus-cousins-to-make-rockets-debut-vs-kings","date":"2020-12-30","title":"John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins to make Rockets debut vs. Kings","content":"The Houston Rockets welcomed back John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon and Mason Jones for Wednesday\u2019s workout ahead of the team\u2019s matchup Thursday against the Sacramento Kings. Wall, Cousins, Gordon and Jones missed Houston\u2019s first two games as they advanced through a league-mandated seven-day quarantine due to \u201chealth and safety protocols.\u201d All four will make their regular-season debuts Thursday night when the Rockets host the Kings at the Toyota Center. \u201cIt was so good to just have everybody there,\u201d Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. \u201cYou obviously miss the talent and the ability that those guys have, but you also miss the personalities that they [have], and the smarts that they bring to these situations. During the film session it was great to have those guys chiming in and chirping as we go through the film. It was really, really good to have those guys back.\u201d Still, the Rockets aren\u2019t yet totally whole with Ben McLemore and K.J. Martin continuing to advance through the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. Silas said he expects both to continue working through the weekend in the league\u2019s coronavirus protocol. The Rockets (0-2) opened the season against the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday with limited lineup options due to six players on the official injury report listed as \u201cout,\u201d while they advanced through the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. Houston played its first two games against the Trail Blazers and the Denver Nuggets with nine players available, one more than the league\u2019s minimum eight players required to play a game. That came after the NBA postponed the team\u2019s originally scheduled season opener on Dec. 23 against Oklahoma City because the Rockets lacked the minimum number of available players required to field a game day roster. Wall expressed frustration about the protocols forcing him and teammates to miss seven days and two games while they quarantined away from the team. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. All I did was get a haircut in my apartment,\u201d Wall said. \u201cOne of the teammates had tested positive the next day, and the next like four or five tests I had, they all came back negative. So, I was with me and three people getting haircuts. I\u2019d rather [get a haircut] in my apartment than be in a barbershop somewhere where random people are just coming in constantly. Even the barber tested negative. So, it was a frustrating thing because I was getting ready for shootaround and had just worked out. I came back, they were like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get off the court. You\u2019ve got to go home for seven days and quarantine.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d Cousins joked he \u201cwas excited\u201d about quarantining before expressing his own frustration. \u201cIt was tough. It\u2019s tough in general to be sitting around for seven days, and no type of activity, just in quarantine,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for any person, but especially a professional athlete. Sitting at home for seven days straight, and then jumping back in a full-speed practice or game, there\u2019s not a lot of positive things on that side. So, like I said, maneuver through (it), and just make the best of what you can.\u201d Cousins and the Rockets certainly need to Thursday as they seek their first win of the season after solid performances in losses, despite being shorthanded. The team\u2019s practice on Wednesday with an almost complete squad was \u201ccompetitive,\u201d according to Cousins. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s excited to finally have the full group together just to see what we can do,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt should be a good game tomorrow. We\u2019re all excited.\u201d Silas mentioned he was still unsure whether he\u2019ll limit minutes for Wall, Cousins and Gordon as they make their regular-season debuts. Jones suffered a sprained ankle during Wednesday\u2019s practice, and sat out most of the workout. \u201cAs far as the protocols that they\u2019ve been going through, up to this point, they haven\u2019t really been working out and being with the team,\u201d Silas said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say what we\u2019ll see tomorrow with those guys.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Devonte\u2019 Graham (CHA) at Mavericks: $5,900 Devonte\u2019 Graham has scored 33-plus FanDuel points over his last two games. He has a tougher-than-usual matchup this evening, but he logged 35 minutes in Charlotte\u2019s upset over Brooklyn, and I expect him to see a similarly high share of the minutes tonight. Avery Bradley (MIA) vs. Bucks: $4,000 Bradley played 24 minutes off the bench last night and finished third in points scored. He\u2019s averaging 26.5 minutes per game so far, and if he gets that level of workload again tonight and Butler sits, I expect him to hit value at his low-end price point. Jaylen Brown (BOS) vs. Grizzlies: 8,000 Jaylen Brown struggled with his shot last night, but he played only 34 minutes and will be much fresher than Jayson Tatum. Expect him to lead Boston\u2019s offense tonight against the Grizzlies, who give up the most FanDuel points per game to opposing small forwards. Tyler Herro (MIA) vs. Bucks: 4,500 The Miami Heat got destroyed by the Milwaukee Bucks last night, but Tyler Herro still finished with 39.1 FanDuel points in 33 minutes. If Jimmy Butler sits again, he\u2019s a good player to target. Donte DiVincenzo (MIL) at Heat: 4,400 DiVincenzo has hit value at this price point three times now, and he just scored 26.2 FanDuel points against the Heats in only 19 minutes. He\u2019ll be fresher than some of Milwaukee\u2019s other key pieces, like Jrue Holiday, who played a team-high 26 minutes. John Collins (ATL) at Nets: 6,800 The Nets rank 23rd against opposing power forwards, and John Collins should do a lot of damage in Atlanta\u2019s offense. We haven\u2019t seen a ceiling game from him yet, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that happen tonight. Keldon Johnson (SAS) vs. Lakers: 5,800 Keldon has gotten off to a strong start this year, as he\u2019s averaging 34 FDPPG, and the Lakers give up the 22nd-most FDPPG to power forwards. Brandon Clarke (MEM) at Celtics: 4,600 Brandon Clarke had a featured role in Memphis\u2019 upset win over the Nets, as he totaled 30.4 FanDuel points in 29 minutes. With both Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson sidelined, expect Clarke to get plenty of extra usage moving forward. Bismack Biyombo (CHA) at Mavericks: 4,600 I like spending down at the center position tonight, and Bismack Biyombo is the most expensive of my value plays at the position. He\u2019ll take on a Mavs defense that\u2019s giving up the 18th-most FDPPG to opposing centers, and he should continue to see starter\u2019s minutes with Cody Zeller hurt. Daniel Thies (BOS) vs. Grizzlies: 3,900 Yes, the Celtics added Tristan Thompson in the offseason, but he just played 27 minutes in the first part of Boston\u2019s back-to-back, his most for the team to date. The Celtics may limit his minutes \u2014 or rest him entirely \u2014 against the Grizzlies, and that should free up some opportunities for Daniel Thies. Dwight Powell (DAL) vs. Hornets: 3,800 Dwight Powell remains Dallas\u2019 starting center and should continue to get plenty of work with fellow big Kristaps Porzingis sidelined. The Hornets give up the most FDPPG to opposing centers, too, which certainly helps his case. While Willie Cauley-Stein will also get some minutes, Powell out-worked him in both of Dallas\u2019 non-blowout games.

He started the decade 124th on the league\u2019s all-time scoring list. He now ranks No. 3 on the all-time scoring list and No. 2 Karl Malone and No. 1 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are well within reach. As he turns 36 today, James is fresh off being named the Associated Press\u2019 male athlete of the decade for a record-tying fourth time. To date, he has four NBA championships, four Finals MVPs, four NBA MVPs, 16 All-NBA selections, 16 All-Star selections, the 2003-04 Rookie of the Year award and three All-Star MVPs, too. He has left an indelible mark on three NBA franchises \u2014 the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami Heat and now, the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 while piling up all manner of statistical milestones along the way. There are the eight straight Finals trips , the ending of Cleveland\u2019s championship drought and so many more moments that have made James an icon in NBA lore. Here\u2019s a look back at some of the plays and on-court moments that marked James\u2019 success in each of those stops. When: 2003-04 to 2009-10 LeBron\u2019s regular-season stats: 27.8 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 7.0 apg, 1.7 spg LeBron\u2019s playoff stats: 29.3 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 7.3 apg, 1.6 spg, 1.0 bpg (2006-10) LeBron\u2019s championships: Zero (lost 4-0 to Spurs in 2007 Finals ) The buzz: From winning Rookie of the Year to amassing the first two of his five career MVPs, LeBron showed glimpses of what he was capable of during his first stint with the Cavaliers. Although he\u2019d fail to taste championship glory, his efforts to merely get the Cavs to the 2007 Finals \u2014 specifically his epic Game 5 against the Pistons in the East finals \u2014 was the stuff of legend. When: 2010-11 to 2013-14 LeBron\u2019s regular-season stats: 26.9 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 6.7 apg, 1.7 spg LeBron\u2019s playoff stats: 26.9 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 5.7 apg, 1.8 spg LeBron\u2019s championships: Two (beat Thunder 4-1 in 2012 Finals ; beat Spurs 4-3 in 2013 Finals ) The buzz: The 2010s for James started with \u201cThe Decision,\u201d the widely criticized televised announcement of his choice to leave Cleveland for Miami. He was with the Heat for four years, went to the NBA Finals all four times with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, finally won the title in 2012 and led the way in a Game 7 win over San Antonio to go back-to-back the following year. When: 2014-15 to 2017-18 LeBron\u2019s regular-season stats: 26.1 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 8.0, 1.4 spg LeBron\u2019s playoff stats: 30.8 ppg, 9.8 rpg, 8.2 apg, 1.8 spg, 1.2 bpg LeBron\u2019s championships: One (beat Warriors 4-3 in 2016 Finals ) The buzz: James returned home in 2014, took Cleveland to four consecutive finals, then led the Cavaliers to the 2016 title and came up with one of the biggest plays of his life by pulling off a chase-down block of Golden State\u2019s Andre Iguodala in the final seconds of Game 7 of that series. When: 2018-19 to present LeBron\u2019s regular-season stats: 26.1 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 9.2 apg, 1.2 spg (through Dec. 30, 2020) LeBron\u2019s playoff stats: 27.6 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 8.8 apg, 1.2 spg LeBron\u2019s championships: One (beat Heat 4-2 in 2020 Finals ) The buzz: The legacy James will leave with the Lakers is still being written, but one chapter is certain: leading L.A. to a championship in 2020 during the NBA\u2019s restart in Orlando. Amidst the coronavirus pandemic that year, James led the Lakers to the top of the heap in a season and playoffs like no other, all while collecting Finals MVP honors. That came during a prolonged season in which he passed both Michael Jordan and later, Kobe Bryant , on the all-time scoring list. He led the league in assists and finished second in Kia MVP voting , too.

He\u2019s not wrong. There have been only seven gamedays so far this season, yet the NBA has already seen 11 games where one team has led by at least 30 points. The Bucks have been incredibly topsy-turvy: their last three games have seen them lead Golden State by 43, trail New York by 28 and lead Miami by 51 on Tuesday before winning 144-97 in a game where they set an NBA record with 29 3-pointers . Through 54 games this season, 14 have been decided by at least 20 points \u2014 a 26% clip. Last season, including playoffs, 20-point wins happened in about 16.5% of games played. Why? Budenholzer points to a three-week training camp where some teams only played two preseason games, nobody played more than four, and all that comes after an offseason where some teams were off for eight months because they didn\u2019t go to last season\u2019s restart bubble and others were off for less than eight weeks before having to get back to work. \u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s been a handful more than normal,\u201d Budenholzer said of the number of lopsided scores so far. \u201cI think the shortened offseason, the shortened preseason, I keep saying this \u2026 people don\u2019t appreciate everything that goes into NBA preparation and what\u2019s called the offseason before training camp even starts.\u201d It\u2019s not only the Bucks who are playing wildly different styles of games in the early days of this season. The Los Angeles Clippers trailed Dallas by 57 on Sunday in what became a 51-point loss, then led Minnesota by as many as 31 on Tuesday in a bounce-back win. Brooklyn\u2019s two wins have come by 26 and 28 points; the Nets are 0-2 in games decided by five points or fewer. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 two wins have come by 23 and 36 points; they\u2019re 0-2 in games decided by single digits. Golden State\u2019s two losses have been by 26 and 39 points; the Warriors\u2019 two wins have come by a combined 11 points, including a win at Detroit on Tuesday. \u201cA great feeling,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said."},{"id":463074,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-set-nba-record-for-3-pointers-in-blowout-of-heat","date":"2020-12-30","title":"Bucks set NBA record for 3-pointers in blowout of Heat","content":"The Milwaukee Bucks demolished the Miami Heat 144-97 on Tuesday night with the long ball, hitting 29 3-pointers to set an NBA team record for most shots made from beyond the arc. By the time Sam Merrill came off the bench late in the fourth quarter to nail his 3 (his only shot of the night), it was number 28 in the barrage, breaking the record of 27 held by the Houston Rockets. The Bucks went on to add another 3-pointer, and 12 Milwaukee players contributed to the onslaught from distance as Milwaukee finished with a 47-point lead. All the Bucks played, and Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only player who didn\u2019t make a 3-pointer. Antetokounmpo missed his two attempts from deep but finished with nine points, six rebounds and six assists in 25 minutes. The Bucks\u2019 outburst came two nights after going 7 for 38 on 3-pointers in a loss to New York. \u201cSome nights, the basketball gods are with you a little bit,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of those nights.\u201d The Bucks could not miss from beyond the arc Tuesday night. Khris Middleton, who led the Bucks with 25 points and was one of seven players in double-figures for Milwaukee, nailed four of his five 3-point attempts. Jrue Holiday made six 3-pointers and finished with 24 points. Donte DiVincenzo hit five of his six attempts. The Bucks were an astounding 29-of-51 (56.9%) from beyond the arc. The Rockets set their record in an 149-113 triumph over the Suns in April 2019 as they drilled 27 shots from beyond the arc. Seven players hit at least two 3s, including Eric Gordon (8-13), James Harden (5-6) and P.J. Tucker (4-9). The Rockets shot 27-for-57 from 3, good for 47.4 %. It was the biggest road win in Bucks history, topping the 39-point margin at New York on April 10, 1987. The 47-point margin matched the second-worst loss in Heat history; they lost 138-91 to Pat Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers in the eighth game of Miami\u2019s first season. The most previously allowed in a game by Miami was 24, on Feb. 5 against the LA Clippers. \u201cI knew we were shooting well,\u201d said Bucks center Brook Lopez, who made three 3-pointers. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were anything close to that.\u201d"},{"id":462775,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ja-morant-out-3-5-weeks-with-grade-2-ankle-sprain","date":"2020-12-29","title":"Ja Morant out 3-5 weeks with Grade 2 ankle sprain","content":"MEMPHIS, Tenn.

Jamal Murray (DEN) vs. SAC: $6,600 Murray has gotten off to a slow start, but he\u2019s still averaging better than 35 minutes per game as one of Denver\u2019s primary offensive options. Murray has tremendous scoring upside, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before he pays it off. At only $6.6K, Murray is a guy to take a shot on given the discounted price tag. Coby White (CHI) vs. WAS: $5,900 With an over\/under of 233.5, I\u2019m looking to get in on all the Bulls and Wizards players I can. White\u2019s sub-$6K price tag makes him an attractive play, given his high-scoring ways and ability to get hot from downtown. Delon Wright (DET) vs. GS: $4,200 Wright has played a key role for the rebuilding Pistons already, proving to be an effective scorer while anchoring the backcourt. With Derrick Rose unlikely to suit up, Wright should continue to see plenty of run, and this is a salary to exploit. Eric Bledsoe (NO) vs. PHO: $4,800 Bledsoe\u2019s 31.4 FD points in the season opener seem like they came a long time ago, but the fact remains, Bledsoe is averaging better than 30 minutes per game with New Orleans, and the upside is absolutely there. For just $4.8K, I\u2019m willing to roll the dice for the upside and playing time. Josh Jackson (DET) vs. GS: $4,300 I\u2019ll look to take advantage of some cheap price tags among Detroit\u2019s playmakers, playing in a quality matchup with Golden State. Jackson has been big with his new team, and coming off a season-high 27 points, he\u2019s a great value. Jerami Grant (DET) vs. GS: $5,700 Just like Jackson and Wright above, I\u2019ll add one more Piston to the list of value plays. Grant is a high-usage guy who\u2019s becoming a stud in the Motor City. His price tag is still too low, and it will probably begin to rise following this one. I\u2019ll take this value while I can get it. Naz Reid (MIN) vs. LAC: $4,500 Now the de facto starting center for Minnesota, Reid should get plenty of playing time tonight against Los Angeles. In his first start Sunday filling in for the injured Karl-Anthony Towns, Reid went for 11 points, five rebounds, four assists, and two steals across 27 minutes. Thaddeus Young (CHI) vs. WAS: $3,800 With Lauri Markkanen a GTD for Tuesday\u2019s matchup with Washington, Young provides a low-cost, high-reward option in your lineups. If he ends up starting in place of Markkanen, Young could return plenty of value at just $3.8K in an excellent matchup with plenty of projected scoring. Chris Boucher (TOR) vs. PHI: $5,900 Coming off a monster 22\/10 performance that included seven blocks, Boucher looks poised to return value on tonight\u2019s slate when the Raptors face the 76ers. Wendell Carter (CHI) vs. WAS: $5,100 Carter had his best game of the season Sunday against Golden State, posting a 22-point, 13-rebound double-double, and the Bulls\u2019 center has seen his playing time and production increase each week. As mentioned above, I\u2019m trying to get in on the Bulls\/Wizards action, and Carter makes a nice value play at center.

The NBA\u2019s general managers did the same for Giannis Antetokounmpo earlier this month in the NBA.com GM Survey . It\u2019s hard to argue against their logic when discussing the early favorites for the 2020-21 Kia MVP Award. Doncic built his buzz with a spectacular 2019-20 season that culminated with a historic, next-level effort in the playoffs that shocked the NBA ecosystem. Antetokounmpo rides into this season on the strength of back-to-back Kia MVPs, leading the best regular-season team in the league both times. But given the recent (and unpredictable) history of the MVP chase, this in no two-man race. In fact, the field appears to be as deep as it\u2019s been in years. There are established candidates, newcomers, long-shots and even a dark horse or two in the mix this season. This award has changed hands between just seven players since the 2008-09 season \u2014 LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Antetokounmpo. That\u2019s a 12-season run dominated by James (4), Curry (2) and Antetokounmpo (2). We\u2019re toe-deep into this 72-game season, but there\u2019s a real opportunity for a fresh face to break into what is arguably the NBA\u2019s most elite club (the Finals MVP is the only other individual honor that matches it). Sure, six of the seven active Kia MVP winners (everyone but Rose, who is a Kia Sixth Man Award candidate in Detroit) could easily factor into this season\u2019s chase. And, most likely, they\u2019ll do exactly that at some point during the next three months. The chances of someone other than those usual suspects playing their way into the conversation seems just as likely to happen. In advance of next week\u2019s first Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of 2020-21, here is a closer look at 20 names who will factor into the conversation. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks: The Mavericks\u2019 superstar is a walking triple-double and will have every chance to prove the oddsmakers right with another monster season leading an upstart Mavericks team to a top seed in the Western Conference. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers: Fresh off of his first championship, AD will contend for MVP and Kia Defensive Player of the Year \u2014 following up the double-win by Antetokounmpo last season \u2014 as he ascends to the top of his game. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers: Showing out against the Lakers (21 point-second half) Monday night was a great reminder of just how quickly Lillard can take over games. The Trail Blazers have to win big to make sure he stays in the mix. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets: He\u2019s looked great so far and will draft off another superstar (Durant) as the Nets stake their claim to the top spot in the Eastern Conference. As long as he stays healthy and the Nets keep rolling, he\u2019s locked in. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks: The Hawks\u2019 3-0 start is the ideal way for Young to launch his campaign. If the Hawks make the playoff leap their offseason suggests, Young will go from All-Star starter in his second season to legitimate MVP candidate in his third. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets: He\u2019s been in the mix the past two seasons, but if he leads the league in assists and keeps the Nuggets in striking distance for No. 1 in the West, this could be his year. Domantas Sabonis, Indiana Pacers: The undefeated Pacers are feeding off of the dominant play of their All-Star big man, who is making up for the time he lost in the restart due to injury. Sabonis has been a two-way behemoth thus far. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers: If the arrival of coach Doc Rivers has the impact many expect, Embiid could be the greatest beneficiary. Injuries, inconsistency and spotty conditioning have cost Embiid in the past. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics: Tatum already has an early-season signature moment (the banked in game-winner over Antetokounmpo ) to build off of. The stage is set for Tatum and Jaylen Brown to power the Celtics to top of the East, if they can handle the weight. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers: A day away from his 36th birthday and he\u2019s still at the top of his game 18 seasons into his career. As much as he\u2019d appreciate another Kia MVP, a Finals MVP means much more for his legacy. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks: There hasn\u2019t been a back-to-back-to-back MVP since Larry Bird (1984-86). Antetokounmpo has a fighting chance to join the extremely short list of legends (Bull Russell from 1961-63 and Wilt Chamberlain from 1966-68) to accomplish that feat. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors: The Warriors don\u2019t even look like a playoff team right now, which could snuff out the fire for Curry\u2019s campaign before we get into the meat of the season. But if anyone can shoot their way back into the debate, it\u2019s Curry. James Harden, Houston Rockets: Even with all of the drama surrounding Harden to start this season, he\u2019s still a viable MVP candidate, wherever he plays. When you can light it up as quickly and outlandishly as Harden does, there\u2019s always a spot for you in the debate. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets: Durant won\u2019t preoccupy himself with trying to do anything other than get back to being the best version of himself after an 18-month absence after Achilles surgery. For anyone with memory issues, don\u2019t forget: he was a back-to-back Finals MVP. Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns: Paul, or his teammate Devin Booker, could enter the MVP conversation if the Suns end up as one of the top Western Conference teams by March. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers: His penchant for load management notwithstanding, Leonard is consistently at an MVP level. Those stitches in his mouth will obviously slow him up a bit here at the start of the season, but he should not be counted out just yet. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz: The appreciation for Mitchell\u2019s game and impact on the Jazz grows each season. When will that lead to a more substantial boost to his MVP candidacy? Tough call in a league filled with superstar guards. Zion Williamson, New Orleans Pelicans: Yeah, we\u2019re probably a season away from him moving into a more prominent position in this conversation. But it\u2019s wise to keep Williamson in mind, especially if the Pelicans are as good as they\u2019ve looked \u2014 albeit in a very limited sample size. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies: Morant made an emphatic entrance into his second season, only to suffer a nasty ankle sprain Monday night. How quickly he plays his way back into the discussion depends on the severity of that injury. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat: An All-Star and All-NBA talent, Adebayo is also a candidate for Kia Defensive Player of the Year. The Heat are at their best when things run through their young big man on both ends of the floor \u2026 just ask Jimmy Butler. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Holiday knows how much the Bucks and the city are counting on him, and he\u2019s fine with that. He\u2019s counting on himself, too. \u201cHonestly, I think in any position there\u2019s some sort of pressure,\u201d Holiday said earlier this month. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle pressure, you probably shouldn\u2019t be in this locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure everywhere. For me, being able to control that, handle that through my family life, handle that with my teammates who support me and I them, I feel that\u2019s kind of how you get through those type of pressure times.\u201d There is one better way: Give the Bucks the upgrade from Eric Bledsoe at both ends of the floor and, in particular, at the end of the season. Regardless of Holiday\u2019s stats or the package of players and picks Milwaukee sent out for him, his value largely will be measured by how different the 2021 playoffs end than they did for the Bucks in \u201920 or \u201919. \u201cThe confidence that he plays with will spread amongst the team,\u201d said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, whose team faced and got obliterated by Milwaukee on Christmas. \u201cWhen you get deep in the playoffs, what you really need is as many alpha two-way players as you can get.\u201d Three games into his Bucks tenure \u2014 and on the brink of consecutive games against East rival Miami ( Dec. 29, 7:30 p.m. ET, TNT and Dec. 30, 7:30 ET, NBA TV ) \u2014 Holiday has shown glimpses of the player the Bucks and others coveted when he hit the trade market. He is averaging 15 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists and shooting 58.8% (despite a chilly 1-for-9 start on 3-pointers). In his 12 th NBA season, the veteran is held in such high regard that a third of the league\u2019s general managers considered his move to Milwaukee the most significant of the offseason . So do plenty of Holiday\u2019s peers. The Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green missed Friday\u2019s game in Milwaukee with a sore foot, but from the side he saw again Holiday\u2019s two-way skills. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s special about Jrue is, he can guard players that are smaller than him, he can guard players that are bigger than him,\u201d Green said a day later. \u201cJrue has great length. He\u2019s not weak at all \u2014 he can be physical. I think Jrue is one of the best on-ball defenders in the league.\u201d Various analytics point to Holiday as one of the most frequently used and effective defenders matched up on opponents\u2019 primary scorers. Green isn\u2019t shy about singing Holiday\u2019s lockdown praises, though that\u2019s only half of the new Bucks guard\u2019s game. \u201cMilwaukee was already a really good defensive team in the league. Then you add Jrue to that fold,\u201d Green said. \u201cNow, in saying that, Eric Bledsoe is no slouch defensively either. But I think with Jrue, he can guard all positions almost. He was all over everybody [Friday].\u201d Holiday, 30, scored 25 points in Milwaukee\u2019s loss in Boston on opening night. Then he flexed at the other end in dealing with Stephen Curry, helping to limit the Warriors\u2019 star to 6-of-17 shooting, including 2-of-10 on 3-pointers. The Bucks led 100-76 through three quarters when Holiday and the other four starters sat for the night. \u201cHe\u2019s so talented, and he\u2019s so skilled,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said afterward. \u201cI think some of the passes he makes, the vision, the finishing, the left hand, it\u2019s pretty special. We\u2019re still learning Jrue and it\u2019s probably the same for him with us, so we feel like he\u2019s just going to get better and we\u2019ll get better around him.\u201d Clearly there\u2019s room for improvement \u2014 Milwaukee\u2019s third game was a mess, a 20-point loss in New York Sunday in which Holiday scored eight points on 4-of-10 shooting in 28 minutes. But you don\u2019t hear anyone yet complaining that the price it took to get him \u2014 Bledsoe, George Hill, the 24th overall pick in 2020, two future first-round picks and two future pick swaps to the Pelicans, in what became a four-team trade \u2014 was an overpay. \u201cIn terms of giving up pieces for me, again that\u2019s part of the pressure,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a basketball player and I\u2019ve had pressure my whole life.\u201d A native of Los Angeles whose brothers Justin and Aaron play for the Indiana Pacers, Holiday was at All-Star in \u201913, the last of his four seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. He earned All-Defensive honors in \u201918 and \u201919 with New Orleans. Bledsoe shares some of Holiday\u2019s strengths: respected defender (also a two-time All-Defensive selection), with great explosiveness and ball skills. But Bledsoe faded in Milwaukee\u2019s playoff ousters by Boston (2018) and Toronto (2019), and again tailed off against Miami (11.8 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 5.0 apg, shooting 16-of-48 and 3-of-14) in 2020. His underperformances began to drain team confidence before key series even began. Holiday has the Bucks, for now, brimming in that category. He and his wife, Lauren, already have looped Milwaukee into the cities where they generously donated a chunk of his 2020 salary . \u201cHe\u2019s a very unselfish player, a guy that plays extremely hard on both sides of the ball that can score from all three levels,\u201d Bucks forward Khris Middleton said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a guy that loves to create. I think it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to play with a guy like that.\u201d What goes around might come around: Now Holiday is in position to negotiate a contract extension with the Bucks. He has a player option for 2021-22 at $26.2 million, but in February becomes eligible for a four-year maximum deal worth $135 million. There are factors that could give Bucks GM Jon Horst long-term pause, such as the nearly 24,000 minutes already on Holiday\u2019s odometer or the fact he only has appeared in 30 career playoff games. But any optimistic view of what their team accomplishes this season and beyond must see this as more than a one-year fling. \u201cHaving Holiday on the team is big time,\u201d said Antetokounmpo, in a little role reversal rooting for Holiday\u2019s next deal. \u201cHe\u2019s a great leader. He\u2019s a great human being. He can defend. He can score the ball. He\u2019s going to bring that edge that we need.\u201d Said Holiday in anticipation of 2020-21\u2019s newness for him: \u201cI want a chance to put a ring on my finger. You can see it in their eyes that they want that too.\u201d * * *"},{"id":461918,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ja-morant-exits-vs-nets-with-ankle-injury","date":"2020-12-29","title":"Ja Morant exits vs. Nets with ankle injury","content":" Reigning Kia Rookie of the Year Ja Morant went down just before halftime Monday with a left ankle sprain.

After impact, Morant immediately began hopping around wildly, not stopping until he rolled onto the ground near the tunnel. After several minutes of treatment and attempts to put pressure on his leg, Morant was carted out of the arena in a wheelchair. The Grizzlies later confirmed the left ankle sprain , ending Morant\u2019s night. The reigning Kia NBA Rookie of the Year, who returned to the bench in the fourth quarter wearing a walking boot, had scored a career-high 44 points in Memphis\u2019 season opener. The Grizzlies defeated the Nets 116-111 in overtime for their first win of the season. Morant averaged 36 points in the two losses, scoring a career-high 44 in the season opener, but the Grizzlies found enough offense without him Monday. His fall caught the eye of several NBA players, including a pair of former Grizzlies in Tony Allen and Jae Crowder. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Commercial Appeal \u2018s Evan Barnes , Morant cleared an X-ray without a fracture. An MRI is likely to Tuesday, and any estimated timetable after that.

The good news for the Pelicans is David Griffin is no longer shutting down the NBA\u2019s most unique, and perhaps exciting, young player. For a while last season, and definitely in the Orlando bubble, Griffin was a more effective lock-down defender than Giannis Antetokounmpo. The understandably cautious general manager, acting on the advice of the team\u2019s medical and performance staff, took the careful and protective approach with Williamson, with an eye toward a long and healthy future, and kept the player on a minutes leash. But now, with those concerns tempered greatly if not permanently, the league gets to behold the forceful talent that is Williamson, who feels free to be \u2026 well, Zion. \u201cI love to play basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cWith no restrictions? Why wouldn\u2019t I love that?\u201d Truth is, Williamson despised being on the bench for long stretches in his rookie season, which started late because of injury, was interrupted because of the coronavirus delay, then was effectively placed on ice in the summer when the season resumed. You could understand how he felt, and how Griffin felt. But, much like the players currently assigned to guard him, that\u2019s all been left behind. Williamson has looked energetic, forceful, restless and most reassuring of all, healthy since the start of this season. It\u2019s the best possible scenario for the player and the team, with both sides on the same page and fully satisfied with this next phase of the plan. \u201cI want to show that I\u2019m a basketball player,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever the team needs me to do on offense or defense no matter what it is to win. I\u2019m just a competitor.\u201d And just as previously advertised, he\u2019s a force with the ball, causing teams to shuffle their lineups in order to find the right matchup against him. That\u2019s proving to be tricky, because as a unicorn, Williamson is too quick for bigger players and too powerful against smaller players. After three games he\u2019s getting 35 minutes a night, up from 27 minutes last season when he only played 24 games. (For the sake of perspective, only five players in the NBA averaged more than 35 minutes a night last season.) Coach Stan Van Gundy isn\u2019t checking a stopwatch and pulling Williamson from games. Nor is the team counting the number of \u201cbursts\u201d shown by Williamson and putting a cap on that. He is released to do what he does best, which is taking defenders off the dribble, finishing hard at the rim, and helping on the boards \u2014 all rather remarkable for a small forward who stands 6-foot-6. Of course, that height comes with a refrigerator of a body; even though Williamson seems lighter than last year when he was listed at 285 pounds, he hasn\u2019t skimped on pushups. Best of all: He\u2019s averaging 21.7 points and 11.7 rebounds and off to a solid start. On Tuesday, the Pelicans play the Suns and it\u2019s Phoenix\u2019s turn to figure how to check Williamson. Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson both give away too much weight. Jae Crowder is a better fit, body-type wise, but what about strength? That\u2019s the dilemma facing teams. Anyway, the league today is all about matchups, mainly because of the increased emphasis on isolation and one-on-one play. The other factor is Williamson isn\u2019t your typical, stand-at-the-perimeter player \u2014 again, a staple of today\u2019s NBA. He\u2019s mobile without the ball and looks to do his damage in the soft spot of the defense, usually the mid-range area which is mainly left open. And at the rim, Williamson challenges taller players by going strong to his natural left hand, and hanging in mid-air long enough to release the shot at the last second. He\u2019s taking almost nine free throws a game, and the only problem is he\u2019s shooting just 57% at the line. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable playmaker for a guy at his size,\u201d said Van Gundy. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who can take the ball off the glass and lead the break and make plays. He can make passes off the dribble. He can finish over bigger people inside. He\u2019s a multi-talented guy.\u201d Much like teammate Brandon Ingram, Williamson doesn\u2019t fit in a specific forward position. Nor does Van Gundy concern himself with that. It\u2019s the other team\u2019s worry, not the Pelicans\u2019. Van Gundy is taking the gradual approach in his first year coaching Williamson, and using each game to gauge the player and the system and what works best for all. The potential for mismatches has allowed both Ingram and Williamson to flourish and create solid chemistry, and because of that, they\u2019re easily the Pelicans\u2019 main source of offense. Van Gundy said: \u201cMy guess is as time goes on, I\u2019m going to find out that he can do even more than I think he can do, and things will evolve from there.\u201d This is the arrangement Williamson and the Pelicans hoped for. It\u2019s putting distance between this and the old one, where Williamson was pulled from games regardless of the score. Griffin was too worried about his body type and injury history \u2014 Williamson missed the first 44 games his rookie season after knee surgery \u2014 to take any chances. It was an odd existence, but the Pelicans were going nowhere special last season, so why not preserve Williamson, allow him to get in better shape, and start anew in 2020-21? \u201cI think I was only able to finish a game maybe three, maybe four times last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was tough, man. When you\u2019re going through rehab and when you\u2019re finally able to step on the court, three minutes goes by, four minutes by and \u2026 you gotta get subbed out. It was a lot.\u201d There are no concrete plans to revisit minutes restrictions or play the load management card with Williamson. That doesn\u2019t mean the Pelicans have totally let down their guard. Everything will be monitored for him, as well as other players on the team. As long as Williamson\u2019s body responds favorably, he\u2019ll never see the intimidating shadow of David Griffin crouching in front of him, ready to apply the stops. \u201cI just want him on the court,\u201d Van Gundy said. And if Williamson stays good for 30-plus minutes a night, the Pelicans believe they\u2019ll like what\u2019s coming their way. Steven Adams, the Pelicans\u2019 center, said: \u201cHis potential is definitely up there. He\u2019s an amazing athlete, an amazing player. And he\u2019s built like a brick \u2026 you know the rest.\u201d Williamson said when he\u2019s healthy, \u201cI\u2019m just a different kind of player\u201d who wants to fulfill all the enormous hype that followed him from Duke and made Pelicans employees jump off their chairs and pound tables when the team secured the rights to the No. 1 pick in 2019. That\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, yet based on the early returns, Williamson seems ready to travel that road. And most reassuring of all, the Pelicans are no longer standing before him and blocking the way. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Mike Conley (UTA) vs. OKC: $6,300 Conley has averaged 31 minutes across his first two games, and while he\u2019s scored less than 1.0 FD point per minute thus far, he\u2019s got the opportunity and an excellent matchup to make his $6.3K price a value on tonight\u2019s slate. Killian Hayes (DET) vs. DET: $3,800 Hayes has averaged just over 8.0 FD points in his first two NBA games, but he\u2019s worth a look tonight with a potential boost in usage. Hayes has seen the court for 40 total minutes, but with Derrick Rose (rest) out against Atlanta, Hayes could be more involved and pay off his $3.8K price tag. Dillon Brooks (MEM) vs. BKN: $3,700 Brooks at just $3.7K is an unbelievable pricing exploitation. Across his first two games, Brooks has scored at least 28.4 FD points and logged at least 30 minutes in each contest. This one is a head-scratcher, but take the value where you can get it. Brooks is a no-brainer on tonight\u2019s slate. Kevin Huerter (ATL) vs. DET: $4,500 Brooks at just $3.7K is an unbelievable pricing exploitation. Across his first two games, Brooks has scored at least 28.4 FD points and logged at least 30 minutes in each contest. This one is a head-scratcher, but take the value where you can get it. Brooks is a no-brainer on tonight\u2019s slate. Jerami Grant (DET) vs. ATL: $5,700 Grant is coming off his best game of the season, after he posted 28 points, 10 boards, and three blocks in Saturday\u2019s loss to Cleveland. He\u2019ll look to keep up that positive play in a favorable matchup with Atlanta which sports one of the evening\u2019s highest over\/unders (226.5). Kyle Anderson (MEM) vs. BKN: $4,600 Memphis\u2019 players are undervalued across the board on tonight\u2019s slate, and Anderson comes in at just $4.6K. He\u2019s averaged 32.2 FD points across 32 minutes per contest, including a 20\/14 showing against Atlanta on Saturday. He\u2019s got a good matchup and an affordable price tag. Kyle Kuzma (LAL) vs. POR: $4,200 It\u2019s unclear if Anthony Davis or LeBron James or both will be out for Monday\u2019s matchup with Portland, but if either misses the contest, Kuz could be in line for another start. In Sunday\u2019s win over Minnesota, he scored 36.1 FD points in the starting lineup and would be in for a similar workload Monday with continued absences. His price tag makes him a huge bargain at just $4.2K. Darius Bazley (OKC) vs. UTA: $5,800 I\u2019ll follow the minutes and usage with Bazley, who went 15\/10 in 33 minutes in the Thunder\u2019s opener. He\u2019s expected to play a big role for the rebuilding Thunder this season, and I\u2019ll take a chance on him for just $5.8K. Mason Plumlee (DET) vs. ATL: $6,000 Through two games, Plumlee has averaged 10.0, 8.5 boards, 5.5 assists, and 1.5 steals across 32.5 minutes.

The good teams were mostly good, the bad teams were mostly bad, and there were some mixed results in between. And then came Sunday. It started with the notorious 12:30 p.m. tip at Staples Center. The Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard, but were coming off big wins over the Lakers and Nuggets, looking very much like the favorite to take the No. 1 spot in this week\u2019s Power Rankings. But it didn\u2019t take long for the Dallas Mavericks to squash that thought. Less than nine minutes into the game, the Mavs led by 20. By halftime, they had set an NBA record with a 50-point lead. The Brooklyn Nets were next up on the list of contenders for the No. 1 spot, facing an opponent looking like No. 30 after losses to Cleveland and Oklahoma City. But the Charlotte Hornets wouldn\u2019t go away, and they held off a late Nets rally to flip two different scripts. Not to be outdone, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Sixers by 24. And to cap off Silly Sunday, the New York Knicks beat the Milwaukee Bucks by 20. We could just disregard all that and think of the Clippers as the team that beat the Lakers and Denver, evaluate the Nets solely on their destruction of the Warriors and Celtics, and believe that the Bucks are never going to lose to the Knicks again. But the league office has confirmed that Sunday games count the same as games on any other day of the week. So we roll it all into this week\u2019s rankings, which probably look as silly as the Sunday scoreboard . The great thing is that all those teams that got upset on Sunday can put those results behind them this week. And if the rankings below are way off, we\u2019ll get another try next Monday. Until then, the champs are still No. 1. They\u2019re the only title contender that didn\u2019t get the Silly Sunday memo, taking care of business (and then some) against the shorthanded Minnesota Timberwolves.

Following Brooklyn\u2019s 106-104 loss to the Hornets, Nets coach Steve Nash said Dinwiddie would be further evaluated on Monday. The Nets host Memphis on Monday ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ).

It appears only a matter of time before it sees him to the top of the all-time list as well. On Sunday against the Bulls , the former two-time Kia MVP and three-time NBA champion joined a stratosphere enjoyed by just two others when he hit his 2,500th career 3-pointer. He sank the milestone shot with 1 minute left in the first quarter, a 26-foot 3-pointer off an assist by Eric Paschall. Only Reggie Miller and Ray Allen \u2014 Hall of Famers and storied shooters in their own right \u2014 have made as many . Curry needed just 702 games to do it, far fewer than Allen (1,021) or Miller (1,288). The 32-year-old\u2019s blistering pace, which saw him make more than 200 3-pointers in seven consecutive seasons, makes his ascent to No. 1 on the all-time 3-pointers made list seem a question of when, not if. Curry\u2019s recent achievements \u2014 including passing Hall-of-Famer Rick Barry on the Warriors\u2019 all-time scoring list \u2014 are a fresh reminder of his otherworldly talent after the star guard played in just five games due to injury last season."},{"id":460960,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/carmelo-anthony-to-miss-blazers-lakers-game-due-to-healthy-and-safety-protocols","date":"2020-12-28","title":"Carmelo Anthony to miss Blazers-Lakers game due to Healthy and Safety Protocols","content":"Portland\u2019s frontcourt depth will be depleted when it faces the defending champion Lakers on Monday ( 10 p.m. ET, NBA TV ).

The 6-foot-10 forward is quickly closing in on that select group. Durant eclipsed 23,000 career points in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunday game against Charlotte on a 14-foot pullup jumper with 5:30 left in the second quarter. The 852 games he needed to reach the milestone are the ninth-fewest in league history. Overall, Durant finished with 29 points (9-15 FG), three rebounds and four assists in the 106-104 loss. Aside from his 23,000-point milestone, Durant also made some Nets history in the game alongside his superstar teammate, guard Kyrie Irving. Thanks to Irving\u2019s 25-point night, he and Durant became the first pair of Nets to score 20 or more points in each of the team\u2019s first three games. Durant\u2019s surge through the record books comes despite playing just 27 games in 2014-15 and missing the entire 2019-20 season due to injury.
