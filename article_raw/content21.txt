Walker IV poured in 32 points on 12-for-23 shooting and added six rebounds as well. After a torn meniscus in his right knee limited him to 17 games last season, Walker IV is out to show he\u2019s still the scoring guard he was when the Spurs drafted him No. 18 overall in 2018. Kevin Hervey, Oklahoma City Thunder The undrafted big man is trying to pave a path to OKC\u2019s camp this fall and may be well on his way. He did it all on Monday against the Sixers, logging a double-double (17 points, 17 rebounds) while showing solid court sense on defense. After an 11-point, 12-rebound Summer League debut on Saturday vs. Utah, Hervey has likely been the Thunder\u2019s best player so far in Las Vegas. Bruce Brown, Detroit Pistons Last season, Brown struggled with his shot (39.6%) and was a virtual non-factor as a 3-point shooter (25.8%). One Summer League game does not a shooter make, but his improved shooting range and consistency were bright spots in Detroit\u2019s win vs. the Pacers. He shot a respectable 4-for-9 overall (and 1-for-2 on 3-pointers) and remained particularly active as a defensive rebounder. Semaj Christon, Sacramento Kings In the California Classic, Christon was one of the better all-around performers for the Kings. He continued that trend on Monday against the Dallas Mavericks, excelling in a variety of ways (15 points, nine rebounds, eight assists). He has been out of the league for two seasons and is hoping to turn some heads with performances like these in Summer League. Rui Hachimura, Washington Wizards Washington\u2019s top pick in the 2019 draft was not flashy at all in a thrilling win vs. the Brooklyn Nets. What he was, though, was timely. Hachimura finished with 19 points and was active around the rim, finishing strong or shooting with confidence in those situations. Tacko Fall, Boston Celtics Players with a cult following are nothing new in Summer League, and Fall is the latest player to receive such honors. He lived up to the cheers and pregame adulation from a pro-Celtics crowd by scoring 12 points on 5-for-5 shooting off the bench (in just 11 minutes). His offense and ability to control the paint on defense helped energize Boston en route to its 89-72 blowout win. Jaxson Hayes, New Orleans Pelicans Zion Williamson, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2019 Draft, had a short run in Summer League. But he got a lot of enjoyment out of watching Hayes play on Monday, celebrating as much as the crowd did after Hayes\u2019 vicious poster jam over the Bulls. That play highlighted a monster night for the rookie Hayes, who finished with 28 points (on 10-for-15 shooting), four rebounds and three blocks in the Pelicans\u2019 runaway victory. Qi Zhou, China The big man delivered off the bench in the final game of the night at Cox Pavilion, carving up the Hornets inside all game long. He had 17 points and nailed a trio of 3-pointers while also collecting nine rebounds to power China to an upset of the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan Poole, Golden State Warriors The No. 28 pick of the 2019 Draft, Poole has been a steady scorer for Golden State at Summer League. He kept that rolling on Monday night, but showed better shot selection in getting his 23 points (on 7-for-15 shooting) in the Warriors\u2019 win against the Los Angeles Lakers."},{"id":32755,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chinas-world-cup-team-sees-summer-league-opportunity","date":"2019-07-09","title":"China's World Cup team sees Summer League as opportunity","content":" LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s national team came to the NBA Summer League looking for education. They\u2019re learning plenty \u2014 and got a win as well. Summer League is essentially several preseason games for the Chinese. They\u2019re in Las Vegas to get ready for the FIBA World Cup, which will take place in China from Aug. 31 through Sept. 15 \u2014 with USA Basketball entering as the top-ranked team in the world and the presumed favorites to win the tournament for the third straight time. Fans in basketball-mad China are already eager for the World Cup. The national team is getting there, and an 84-80 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday was a sure sign of progress. \u201cThere\u2019s high expectation so we\u2019ve got to be ready and we\u2019ve got to raise the pressure,\u201d China coach Li Nan said earlier Monday. \u201cNot just the players, also the coaching staff. We need to concentrate on our details, do preparations now, concentrate on our stuff.\u201d Among the challenges for the Chinese so far in Las Vegas: Getting used to the speed and strength of the teams in Summer League, and Li said he\u2019s urged his players to start becoming tougher mentally. \u201cIt\u2019s so fast. It\u2019s a different level,\u201d Li said. \u201cThe contact, we\u2019ve never seen this before. The rules are different. It\u2019s hard to play this tournament.\u201d The Chinese (1-2) lost their first two games in Las Vegas \u2014 they fell by 41 points to Miami on Friday, and looked much better in a 17-point loss to Sacramento on Saturday. They trailed by six in the opening minutes against Charlotte on Monday, then took the lead late in the first quarter and held it the rest of the way. \u201cWe\u2019re still improving a lot,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe improved a lot when we came here. The first game we weren\u2019t ready for the physical game, the fast game. The second game, on a back to back, we started realizing some things.\u201d The players China brought to Las Vegas represent the bulk of what will be the nation\u2019s World Cup roster. Longtime NBA player Yi Jianlian is expected to play in the World Cup, and he\u2019s not playing in Las Vegas because of an injury. Guo Ailun, one of the more talented Chinese players, didn\u2019t play against Miami, scored 20 points against Sacramento and had 12 more in the win over the Hornets. \u201cThe intensity of the game is really high in the summer league,\u201d Guo said through a translator before Monday\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s much stronger than what is in China. \u2026 The intensity, the pace, it\u2019s really a challenge.\u201d For group play in the World Cup, China will take on Poland, Venezuela and the Ivory Coast. Based on FIBA rankings, it\u2019s not a particularly strong group and it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that China would make at least the tournament\u2019s second round. Li believes the level of play at Summer League may even exceed what the Chinese see in group play. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of help,\u201d Li said. \u201cThose teams, I think they\u2019re better than the other teams in the group. We\u2019re trying to play to win these games and we\u2019ll use those games to have confidence to face the other opponents.\u201d"},{"id":32740,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-bulls-summer-league-recap","date":"2019-07-09","title":"Game Recap: Pelicans 109, Bulls 72","content":"Juan Carlos Blanco, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The New Orleans Pelicans rode a team-leading 28 points from first-round pick Jaxson Hayes to a 109-72 win over the Chicago Bulls at the Las Vegas Summer League on Monday evening.

The Lakers have been busy this offseason adding talent to surround LeBron, who played a career-low 55 games last season and didn\u2019t reach The Finals for the first time since 2011. According to Haynes, the 34-year-old is in \u201cgreat shape with no restrictions\u201d. In addition to the blockbuster trade for Davis, the Lakers have officially added Green, DeMarcus Cousins, Quinn Cook, Jared Dudley and Troy Daniel. They reportedly also have deals with guards Rajon Rondo and Avery Bradley. According to Haynes, new coach Frank Vogel hopes the move to point guard will help LeBron \u201cunleash another element\u201d to his game.

And this process is now three years deep. Few, if any, other teams launch in Las Vegas more than the Hawks, who committed to build through the draft in 2017. That blueprint is slowly changing into golden results. John Collins was followed by Trae Young and Kevin Huerter. And the latter pair are now being followed by DeAndre Hunter and \u2014 if he were healthy enough to play in Vegas \u2014 Cam Reddish. Collins, Young and Huerter made the league\u2019s All-Rookie teams and the Hawks sense the same could be coming for Hunter and Reddish, Atlanta\u2019s latest first-round picks set to fulfill needed roles and receive ample playing time. This high-drafting success rate is the solid work of Travis Schlenk, who assumed the GM duties three summers ago while stressing the importance of a total makeover with youth. Not only has Schlenk yet to make a mistake \u2014 debate the Luka Doncic swap that produced Young and Hunter all you like \u2014 he has created a promising young core that\u2019s projected to pay even greater dividends in the near future. Or earlier. Quite possibly, the Hawks could be a playoff team in 2019-20. And next summer, armed with salary cap space, they\u2019ll turn their attention toward free agency and see what happens there. It\u2019s all part of a step-by-step process designed to blend young players with veterans, to stockpile assets and turn the Hawks into a playoff regular and maybe, someday, a title contender. You might say, at this early stage, they\u2019re on schedule. \u201cWhen we sat down with ownership after I was hired, the Hawks were the fifth-oldest [team] in the league,\u201d said Schlenk, who was plucked from the respected Warriors front-office staff. \u201cWe went from 60 wins to 48 wins to 42 wins. We had a couple guys [Al Horford, Paul Millsap] who would be free agents and who would get big contracts. We made the decision that now\u2019s the time to hit the reset button and instead of spending money on free agents, we should absorb assets and enter the draft and go that route.\u201d Schlenk and his front office staff are compiling quite a track record. The GM\u2019s first decision was taking Collins at No. 19. Maybe a bit of good fortune was involved in that, given how far Collins \u2014 a solid power forward at Wake Forest \u2014 dropped. In any event, Collins\u2019 development has been steady and just shy of remarkable. Collins averaged 19.2 points and 9.8 rebounds last season, sharp increases from his rookie year numbers of 7.3 and 3.9. He improved his shooting and footwork and has turned into a dependable double-double force. Last year\u2019s draft may eventually prove to be a game-changer for the Hawks. Schlenk made the gutsy decision, against the opinion of those he trusted outside the organization \u2014 and even inside the draft room \u2014 trading Doncic\u2019s rights for those of Young and the Mavericks\u2019 first-rounder this summer. While Doncic eventually won Rookie of the Year, Young produced the superior line after the All-Star break and finished runner-up for the award. Also, Young was not only productive, he dazzled on the floor with his long-distance shot-making and passing, giving the Hawks an entertainment asset. Later in that draft, the Hawks nabbed Huerter, who surpassed expectations as the No. 19 overall selection. Hurter was a rotation player by January and became a threat when left open. He shot 42 percent from deep and made the All-Rookie Second Team. \u201cI think Travis hit a home run in getting the guys we wanted to get,\u201d said coach Lloyd Pierce. The Hawks controlled three No. 1 picks heading into this year\u2019s draft. They sacrificed one to trade up and get Hunter, who helped Virginia win the NCAA Championship with a game-tying shot at the end of regulation. Yet Hunter \u2014 the 2018-19 ACC Defensive Player of the Year \u2014 was most valued for his ball-stopping D, and the Hawks were one of the worst defensive teams in the league last year, a byproduct of being so young. \u201cYou need someone to go out and guard the other team\u2019s best player,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cHe was someone we sought all along.\u201d Then with the No. 10 overall pick, they chose Reddish, a scoring wing at Duke. Both Hunter and Reddish are projected as possible starters. \u201cThe biggest assets we\u2019ve had are our lottery picks,\u201d said Schlenk. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build this thing and identify pieces that will fit together. All the guys we\u2019ve taken are great people, too; it\u2019s not just their skill set, and that\u2019s important to have high character guys.\u201d Also: Schlenk once again used the Hawks as a dumping ground for bad contracts and added additional future first-rounders for taking Allen Crabbe, Chandler Parsons and Evan Turner. \u201cTo get those picks, we thought it was worth it,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cAnd we also think these guys can help us, too.\u201d The next step is building through trades and free agency, and to do it before it\u2019s time to pay Collins and Young what are shaping up to be pricey extensions. While Atlanta hasn\u2019t proven to be a top-draw destination for free agents, Schlenk believes the dynamics of the city and organization have changed for the better. \u201cI was in Golden State for 13 years and nobody talked about it as free-agent destination,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you draft good people, and people who can win, people start noticing you. The first real free agent we got with the Warriors was Andre Iguodala. He came because he wanted to play with Steph (Curry) and Klay (Thompson) and he thought we were on the upward track. That\u2019s what we hope to duplicate here. Trae is a very willing and capable passer, for instance, and guys want to play alongside that guy. Atlanta\u2019s a great city and we\u2019re putting everything together. We have a dedicated ownership group that\u2019s willing to spend. We think we\u2019re on the right path.\u201d Maybe the Hawks have already won over their most important skeptics: the home fans. Atlanta was notorious for being lukewarm toward the Hawks even when the club was winning, and it wasn\u2019t unusual for Philips (now State Farm) Arena to be evenly split whenever the Hawks played the Lakers, Knicks or Warriors. \u201cThe first year of this process, the fans really didn\u2019t see the vision,\u201d Schlenk said, \u201cbut last year, as our young guys improved, we had great crowds. I think the community is into it, they see it and it\u2019s exciting.\u201d The newcomers such as Hunter and Reddish, therefore, have to stay in step with those who came before them. And those baby steps will take place here in Las Vegas before they hit the floor in Atlanta. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Under NBA rules, the Warriors will have one year to utilize the traded player exception, which is created when a player is traded to a team under the salary cap with space to absorb the contract. \u201cDuring the summer of 2013, we went through an extensive free agency process in our efforts to sign Andre Iguodala,\u201d said Warriors Co-Chairman and CEO Joe Lacob. \u201cAt that time, we envisioned him becoming a vital part of a young, up-and-coming team with championship aspirations.

In what has been well-documented, Andre sacrificed for the betterment of our team and, in one of the best stories of this journey, earned NBA Finals MVP honors in 2015.

Miami said hello to Jimmy Butler. The Lakers finally have Anthony Davis. Free agency became real Saturday. The four-team trade that sent Butler to the Heat \u2014 with a new $142 million, four-year contract \u2014 was one of the first big moves to get done once the league\u2019s offseason moratorium ended. But many of the other massive moves, such as Leonard\u2019s signing with the Los Angeles Clippers and the trade to have Paul George join him, remained in the paperwork stage. Butler acknowledged that his longtime friend, fellow former Marquette star and now-retired Heat guard Dwyane Wade \u201cmay have had a little bit of something to do with\u201d his move to Miami. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can take over the role that Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. had for this organization and for the game of basketball here,\u201d Butler said when asked about taking over as a leader in Miami. \u201cI\u2019m just fortunate and blessed enough to be able to call him a friend, mentor, role model. He\u2019s done so much for me.\u201d There was no real worry about the pending transactions around the league: Some deals, including a few that got agreed upon very quickly when the negotiating window opened June 30, simply needed to be slotted in a certain order to make the NBA\u2019s money rules work. Others could get done as soon as the NBA said at 12:01 p.m. Eastern on Saturday that the new league year was officially underway. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a really exciting season,\u201d said Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, who wasn\u2019t a free agent and won\u2019t be for a long time after signing a $196 million, four-year extension that could keep him with the Trail Blazers until 2025. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s exciting to see players change teams. You know people love that.\u201d Not all people. Not always, anyway. Toronto awoke to the news Saturday that two starters from this past season\u2019s NBA champion Raptors \u2014 Leonard and Danny Green \u2014 were moving on. Leonard picked the Clippers and will sign a $142 million, four-year deal and George will be joining him in a massive trade that will send Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and five draft picks to Oklahoma City in a blockbuster deal that shook up both conferences. Green is joining the Lakers on a two-year deal. \u201cTeams are making moves to win now and that\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Heat forward Meyers Leonard, who left Portland and is part of the four-team Butler deal. \u201cThe Clippers, for example, they\u2019re in `win-now\u2019 mode. They played well last year in the playoffs. They go and get Kawhi and PG and all these other players. OKC has to be thinking, `OK, we just got a ton of draft picks.\u2019 So people are positioning themselves in different ways.\u201d The Clippers and Thunder couldn\u2019t talk about their deal until it was finalized. The Raptors didn\u2019t have to adhere to such rules. \u201cOn behalf of the Raptors, I say a very heartfelt thank you to Kawhi and to Danny, and we send them and their families nothing but good wishes,\u201d Raptors President Masai Ujiri said. \u201cAs an organization, the Raptors will focus on the future and continue our pursuit of a second championship.\u201d Davis wasn\u2019t a free agent, but the Lakers\u2019 move to get him surely played a role in plenty of other moves during free agency. The Lakers\u2019 trade for Davis got done Saturday night, and it cost L.A. a ransom. Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, the draft rights to De\u2019Andre Hunter, two first-round picks, a first-round pick swap and cash went to the Pelicans \u2014 and then the Lakers had to send Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones, Moritz Wagner and a future second-rounder to Washington. The Wizards sent cash to the Pelicans. \u201cAnthony Davis is arguably the most dominant all-around young player in today\u2019s NBA,\u201d Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said. \u201cAnthony represents everything we stand for, with his unwavering commitment to excellence both as a person and an athlete. This is a historic moment for the Lakers franchise, and we couldn\u2019t be more proud to have him.\u201d The sign-and-trade that will have Kevin Durant leaving Golden State for Brooklyn as well as Kyrie Irving\u2019s signing with the Nets were both still pending Saturday night. Golden State\u2019s deal to keep Klay Thompson around at nearly $190 million for five years also wasn\u2019t immediately announced, though there would seem to be little rush there. Boston completed a sign-and-trade with Charlotte, a deal to send All-Star Kemba Walker (4 years, $141 million) to the Celtics and Terry Rozier (3 years, $58 million) to the Hornets. \u201cKemba has excelled in this league for many years while consistently playing at a level among the NBA\u2019s elite,\u201d Celtics President Danny Ainge said. Davis was back for the second straight night at NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, alongside James and Lakers guard Kyle Kuzma. James chatted for a couple minutes with Clippers consultant and NBA legend Jerry West \u2014 before the Lakers and Clippers met in a summer matchup. Also at summer league were a trio of young Atlanta stars \u2014 Kevin Huerter, John Collins and Trae Young. \u201cI\u2019m super excited,\u201d Young said when asked about the moves across the league. \u201cSome of the trades and where people are landing at is just kind of different. It\u2019s kind of a surprise a little bit, but it\u2019s good cause now the league is even more wide open.\u201d Butler left Philadelphia via sign-and-trade for Miami, with Josh Richardson leaving the Heat for Philadelphia. Hassan Whiteside left the Heat for Portland as part of that deal, while Moe Harkless left the Blazers for the Clippers in another part of the same massive trade. \u201cJimmy\u2019s leadership, tenacity, professionalism, defensive disposition and his ability to create his own shot will improve our roster immediately,\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said. \u201cAny time you can add a four-time All-Star to your roster, you make that move.\u201d Butler said Wade told him for years that Miami was the right fit for him. \u201cAnd we were able to make it happen,\u201d Butler said. Among the other deals that got done Saturday: \u2013 Brooklyn completed the signing of center DeAndre Jordan. \u201cAs a veteran center with All-NBA and All-Defensive Team honors on his resume, DeAndre will provide us with the type of defensive mindset, toughness and leadership that are needed to compete at the highest levels of the NBA,\u201d Nets general manager Sean Marks said. \u2013 The Lakers added DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook, plus kept Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and JaVale McGee. \u2013 Orlando completed the signings of its top two free agents, Nikola Vucevic and Terrence Ross. \u2013 Indiana\u2019s sign-and-trade acquisition of Malcolm Brogdon from Milwaukee was completed. \u201cHaving started on the team with the best record in the NBA last year, we value the leadership he\u2019ll bring to our team, as well as his great ability to play multiple positions,\u201d Pacers President Kevin Pritchard said."},{"id":32809,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-lakers-summer-league-recap","date":"2019-07-07","title":"Game Recap: Clippers 93, Lakers 87","content":"Zak Hanshew, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 Mfiondu Kabengele totaled 21 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 93-87 win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Las Vegas Summer League on Saturday at Thomas and Mack Center.

As part of the trade, the Lakers also sent Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones, Moritz Wagner and a future second round draft pick to the Wizards, who in return, sent cash consideration to the Pelicans. \u201cAnthony Davis is arguably the most dominant all-around young player in today\u2019s NBA,\u201d said Pelinka. \u201cAnthony represents everything we stand for, with his unwavering commitment to excellence as both a person and athlete.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither Walker nor the Hornets publicly revealed any details. The Charlotte Observer first reported that Walker had informed the Hornets of his decision . Before free agency began, Walker said he was open to taking less than the supermax from Charlotte. He qualified for the supermax extension from the Hornets after making the third-team All-NBA this season, the first time Walker has made an All-NBA team in his career. Walker averaged a career-high 25.6 points and 5.9 assists for the Hornets this season while earning his third straight All-Star selection. Last season, he passed Dell Curry to become the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 all-time leading scorer and ranks in the franchise\u2019s top five in assists (No. 2), games played (No. 3), defensive rebounds (No. 4) and steals (No. 3). Aside from holding the Hornets\u2019 top scoring mark, he\u2019s also No. 1 in free throws made and attempted, field goals made and attempted and 3-pointers made and attempted. Over the last four seasons, he has averaged more than 20 points per game and is averaging 19.8 points per game for his career since joining the league in 2011 out of UConn, where he won a national championship with the Huskies. However, Walker hasn\u2019t experienced that same team success at the NBA level. The Hornets have made the playoffs only twice during Walker\u2019s career there and have never made it out of the first round \u2014 a major disappointment for the highly competitive Walker. Walker\u2019s departure will be a major blow for the Hornets, who \u2014 barring a late sign-and-trade, which does not seem likely \u2014 will lose their franchise player for nothing. Walker\u2019s departure comes a few weeks after backup point guard Tony Parker, the longtime San Antonio standout who played with Charlotte last season, announced his retirement from the NBA. A four-year NBA veteran, Rozier played in 272 games (30 starts) for Boston, with career averages of 7.7 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 20.0 minutes per game. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be able to acquire Terry in this sign-and-trade deal,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cHe is an up-and-coming player who has shown continued improvement in his four NBA seasons, and we believe he can take that next step as a starting point guard in this league.

It has become the norm in today\u2019s NBA, where recruiting is starting to rival that in college, where backroom negotiating and long-term planning is just as strategic as a play drawn up by a coach during timeout. But this shocking union, which changed the fortunes of the Clippers overnight, was different from the others in this respect: Leonard and George didn\u2019t want to join LeBron James. They wanted to beat LeBron James . As the battle for basketball supremacy begins in earnest next season in Los Angeles \u2014 and by extension, perhaps league supremacy as well \u2014 this must be stressed: For the second time in as many summers, two All-Stars declined the chance to become teammates with one of the game\u2019s greatest players of all time. George was arguably the biggest unrestricted free agent in July of 2018 and all signs pointed toward L.A. and the Lakers at the time. Actually, the George-to-the-Lakers campaign first gained steam a year before, when George entered the final year of his contract with the Pacers and requested a trade. Not long after that, Magic Johnson did his famous \u201cwink-wink\u201d reaction on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d when asked by the host if he thought the Lakers had a good chance at getting George. As it turned out, George was traded to Oklahoma City, where he bonded quickly with Russell Westbrook, a ball-dominant point guard whose style doesn\u2019t agree with everyone, certainly not Kevin Durant, who bailed on Westbrook the previous year for the Warriors. When George and Westbrook lost in the first round that year to Utah, it only fed the perception that George was all but packaged to join LeBron with the Lakers. And yet, George pulled a stunner, re-signed with OKC and was thrown a party by Westbrook. George then had the best season of his career and finished third in the 2018-19 MVP balloting. As that scenario played itself out, another brewed halfway across the country: Leonard and the Spurs were in the midst of a breakup and once again, the Lakers lurked. Spurs coach and president Gregg Popovich wanted no part in helping a rival, however, and sent Leonard to the Raptors, about as far away possible from the Lakers. There, Leonard served his year in exile rather spectacularly, lifting the Raptors to their first-ever championship and then reaching free agency and the chance to give LeBron a Finals MVP as a teammate. This time, the enticement was even greater for Leonard than it was for George: LeBron also had Anthony Davis in the fold, and the chance to add another top-10 player would make the Lakers a strong favorite to sip champagne in 2020. There\u2019s an obvious appeal to be teammates with LeBron. He\u2019s the most unselfish scorer in league history, evident by his staggering number of career assists, far better than anyone who averaged 30 points in a season. Plus, LeBron commands much of the off-court attention, allowing others to lead a less demanding existence in terms of criticism. Plus, LeBron by all accounts is a generous teammate, willing to share his endorsement perks with even the 12th man, and always anxious to include teammates into his exclusive social world. And yet: Leonard not only declined the chance to suit up next to LeBron, but successfully recruited George to leave OKC and join him with the goal of beating LeBron as well as putting the Clippers in position for an NBA takeover. Actually, George was Leonard\u2019s second choice. Days before free agency opened on June 30, Leonard reached out to Kevin Durant to gauge his interest, but Durant by then was already committed to the Nets. With the number of impact free agents dwindling quickly, Kawhi and his camp turned their attention to players already under contract, and George was a natural choice, though an unexpected one. Like Kawhi, George grew up about 25 miles from L.A. and at least part of him yearned to return closer to home. Also, both are scorers who double as elite defenders who can guard multiple positions, and there may not be another player like either in the NBA. George and Kawhi are perennial members of the league\u2019s All-Defensive team. In that sense, the league has never seen a pair of wing teammates with such a balance since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen with the Bulls. Once you consider the Clippers also have tenacious guard Pat Beverley, their calling card next season and beyond will be defense, and this versatility will give coach Doc Rivers many options to choose and schemes to create. Anyway: The conversations between Kawhi and George obviously were mutual and deep enough to force OKC and the Clippers into action once George requested a trade. Sam Presti, the GM with the Thunder, was taken aback. Yet, Presti also wanted to do right by George if only because of what George did for OKC and Presti last summer; the GM was under severe pressure to keep George, who cost Presti a promising young forward in Domantas Sabonis and also scoring guard Victor Oladipo, both sent to Indiana. That said, Presti was clever in his asking price from the Clippers. He wanted a batch of first-round picks, but not any ordinary first-rounders. He wanted picks that kick in just when Kawhi and George are in their late 30s or possibly retired. That way, those picks will likely be at their premium with the Clippers potentially cratering with aging stars or starting a rebuilding process. So OKC gets four unprotected picks outright, one protected for 1-14, and two unprotected first-round swaps. OKC basically owns the Clippers\u2019 future. But the Clippers wanted ownership on the present. And speaking of ownership, Steve Ballmer gave GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West the freedom to win now and worry later. Curiously, West recommended the Clippers trade Blake Griffin last summer right after Griffin signed an extension; this was done to keep salary cap flexibility with 2019 free agency in mind. While this was ongoing, the player left scratching his head today is LeBron. Yes, LeBron did at least get Davis, but Davis was already part of LeBron\u2019s inner circle, as a client of Klutch Sports, the management firm formed by LeBron. And so, to summarize: LeBron never managed to get free agents to Cleveland, unless you count his aging pal Dwyane Wade, and the same now goes for the Lakers. His only taste of a championship happened when he left his team for another, in this case, Cleveland for Miami. The snubbing of LeBron for the second time in two years serves as the tasty subplot of what just happened with the Clippers. And if the Clippers, long considered LA\u2019s second-class team because of their lack of rich history and titles, deny LeBron a championship here in his twilight, how much of a coincidence will that be? The basketball pulse in the NBA next season will be mostly concentrated in Los Angeles and split by the two teams that play in the same building. The motivation for the Lakers is to salvage what\u2019s left of LeBron\u2019s career and affix another banner in the rafters. For the Clippers, it\u2019s to raise their first banner and, as best they can, snatch a snippet of the attention and respect the Lakers enjoy in LA. LeBron James can either beat a pair of stars who wanted no part of being his teammate. Or he can lose and make the basketball world understand why Kawhi Leonard and Paul George chose a different path. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

An All-NBA Second Team member last season, Lillard, 28, joins Clyde Drexler as one of two Trail Blazers to receive All-NBA honors four times. He is one of three players in NBA history to record at least 1,500 points and 400 assists in each of his first seven NBA seasons (Oscar Robertson, LeBron James), and in 2018-19 he became the first player in Trail Blazers history to tally at least 2,000 points and 500 assists in a season. When he was named All-NBA First Team in 2017-18, he joined Drexler and Bill Walton as the only Trail Blazers to achieve the honor. Winner of the 2018-19 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, Lillard (6-3, 195) holds career averages of 23.5 points (43.4% FG, 36.8% 3-PT, 88.9% FT), 4.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 0.97 steals in 549 games (all starts) over seven seasons with the Trail Blazers.

That meant Kawhi Leonard could finally make his. The Clippers will be landing Leonard as a free agent after they acquire Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder in a massive trade for players and draft picks, a person familiar with the negotiations said. George will be traded for at least four first-round picks, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity early Saturday because none of the moves have been finalized. And Leonard made his decision to sign with the Clippers after the team swung the deal to land George, the person said. ESPN, which first reported the trade, also said the Thunder were getting Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari from the Clippers. Leonard going to the Clippers means that for the first time, a reigning NBA Finals MVP will be changing teams before the following season. Leonard was also being pursued by the Los Angeles Lakers and the Toronto Raptors, the team he led to last season\u2019s NBA title. The most the Clippers can offer Leonard is $142 million over four years, which is the deal he is expected to sign. Players can sign with new teams as early as noon Eastern on Saturday. \u201cNew adventure in OKC,\u201d Gallinari tweeted. Leonard is entering his ninth NBA season, is a three-time All-Star, a two-time champion and one of only three players in league history to win the NBA Finals MVP award with multiple franchises. Notoriously a man of few words, at least publicly, Leonard is generally considered to be the best two-way player in the NBA \u2013 dominant on the offensive end, airtight on the defensive end. His game-winning, four-bounce-off-the-rim jumper to beat the buzzer in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Philadelphia was perhaps the signature moment of this past season\u2019s playoffs. And he just turned 28 last week \u2013 still very much in his prime. So, too, is George. The 29-year-old \u2013 who is owed roughly $105 million for the next three seasons \u2013 spent the last two years alongside Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City. George averaged a career-best 28 points last season even while dealing with shoulder issues that required surgery, and the Thunder couldn\u2019t get out of the first round in either of those seasons. He was a finalist for both NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year last season, when he led the league with 2.21 steals per contest. A California native, going to the Clippers and pairing with Leonard means he\u2019ll have a real chance of being on a title contender. The Lakers didn\u2019t wait long before starting to move on from their quest for Leonard. Danny Green announced that he is signing a two-year deal with the Lakers , meaning he, too, is leaving Toronto. \u201cKawhi has made his decision. Seems like the announcement is out,\u201d Green said in a video he posted to his social media accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to make my announcement \u2026 I will be teaming up with new teammates in LA, the Los Angeles Lakers.\u201d Green said he enjoyed Toronto and that it was unfortunate how free agency turned out for that city, the Raptors and for Canada. \u201cLA, here I come,\u201d Green said. Here comes Leonard \u2013 a Southern California native. Even President Donald Trump liked the move, tweeting early Saturday: \u201cGreat Coach, Great Guy!\u201d and providing a link to a story noting Clippers coach Doc Rivers was a big winner landing Leonard and George. Leonard was, by far, the biggest name left on the free agent market. The other marquee names in this class like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson and Kemba Walker all made their decisions known relatively quickly. And like Durant, Irving and Walker, he\u2019s changing addresses. His lone season in Toronto was the best of his career, answering every question about his health after a leg issue limited him to only nine games with San Antonio in 2017-18. Leonard averaged a career-high 26.6 points in the regular season \u2013 and was even better in the playoffs, averaging 30.5 points for the Raptors in their run to the title. \u201cLast year, a lot of people were doubting me,\u201d Leonard said after the NBA Finals. \u201cThey thought I was either faking an injury or didn\u2019t want to play for a team. That was disappointing to me that that was out in the media, because I love the game of basketball.\u201d The Raptors took a major chance in acquiring Leonard last summer, since they weren\u2019t on his original list of preferred teams when he told the Spurs that he wanted to be moved elsewhere after spending his first seven seasons with them and helping them win the 2014 NBA title. DeMar DeRozan was the biggest piece that Toronto gave up in that deal, with Raptors President Masai Ujiri making the biggest move of his career. It delivered a title. But that wasn\u2019t enough to make Leonard stay in Canada for the long haul. \u201cHe\u2019s the best two-way player in the NBA,\u201d Ujiri said during the NBA Finals. Leonard was simply dominant in the postseason, posting 14 games of 30 or more points. Only Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Kobe Bryant had postseasons with more 30-point games \u2013 Jordan had 16 of them in 1992, Olajuwon had 16 in 1995 and Bryant had 15 in 2009. The Raptors made clear: They considered Leonard the top player in the game, and he performed at a level worthy of that moniker. \u201cObviously, we have the best player in the league and the best player in these playoffs in Kawhi Leonard,\u201d Raptors forward Pascal Siakam said after Toronto won the title. They\u2019ll have to defend the title without him. It\u2019s a massive blow to Toronto\u2019s chances of back-to-back titles, and obviously puts a damper on the Lakers\u2019 offseason quest as well \u2013 even though they will finalize a trade Saturday to bring in Anthony Davis from New Orleans and landed the sort of shooter than LeBron James craves by adding Green. \u201cI\u2019m going to come out and play the right way,\u201d Leonard said last month. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make headlines.\u201d Try or not, he\u2019s part of the summer\u2019s biggest headline now. And he may be about to make the Clippers contenders as well."},{"id":32815,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-upstage-lakers-kawhi-leonard-paul-george","date":"2019-07-06","title":"Leonard-George tandem turns Clippers into legit contender","content":" At the moment of truth, Kawhi Leonard went against his persona and caused a shakeup that wasn\u2019t so quiet after all. Quite stunning, actually, was the Friday series of events that directly affected four teams, caused a major trade of unprecedented details, and influenced the NBA Finals MVP to sign a free agent contract with the Clippers, instantly turning a franchise without a banner into a hardcore contender. Leonard is now joined by Paul George , who finished third in the 2018-19 MVP balloting and who requested a trade from Oklahoma City at the 11th hour to essentially swap Russell Westbrook for Leonard. The Clippers are now bringing a pair of swingmen who excel on both ends of the floor, giving them the sort of dynamic tandem that\u2019s almost required to win a title these days. The price for George was steep \u2014 basically, the Clippers surrendered more for George than the Lakers did for Anthony Davis. They handed over a chunk of their future, with three unprotected first-round picks (2022, 2024 and 2026), a pair of coveted Heat first-rounders (2021 unprotected and 2023 protected 1-14) that were owned by LA, and the option to swap first-rounders with the Clippers in 2023 and 2025. OKC also gets 20-year-old point guard Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and veteran shooter Danilo Gallinari. And so the Clippers drastically changed their personality in the span of a few years, replacing the \u201cLob City\u201d era of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan with a feisty defensive club led by Kawhi, George, Pat Beverley and Montrezl Harrell. It\u2019s also a team with three reputable scorers as well: Kawhi, George and Lou Williams. Imagine: The Clippers just upstaged the Lakers in an offseason where the Lakers added Davis to join LeBron James. Adding to the intrigue is the presence of Jerry West, the Laker Hall of Famer whose reign as general manager helped raise multiple banners, but whose touch as a consultant with the Clippers in this process is undeniable. Two summers ago when he joined the Clippers after serving the same role with the Warriors, it was West who persuaded the Clippers to trade Griffin, whom they just gave a maximum contract, to the Pistons. West believed Griffin\u2019s best years were behind him and thought the Clippers would be better as a team with more salary cap flexibility going forward. Plus, West and GM Lawrence Frank traded Tobias Harris, the team\u2019s leading scorer, to Philly at the February deadline rather than re-sign Harris this summer in free agency. All of this was done with the idea of signing an impact player in mind, and Leonard was that player and the Clippers\u2019 top target over the last year. Leonard\u2019s appeal to the Clippers was evident and easy to understand. He\u2019s a player who can score 25 points and grab 7-8 rebounds and lock down his man on the other end of the floor. And of course, he just led the Raptors to a championship without being generously helped by a fellow superstar. Interestingly, Leonard had the option of having not just one, but two fellow superstars this summer had he chosen the Lakers. LeBron and Davis and Leonard would make for a championship favorite, especially when you add Kyle Kuzma to the mix. In the end, Leonard wanted to beat the Lakers, not join them. The Lakers still bring those three players, though, and will now garnish the team with minimum-waged players to fill out the roster. Already, Danny Green announced he\u2019ll sign a two-year, $15 million deal with the Lakers, and Rajon Rondo is perhaps not far behind. Both the Lakers and Clippers could compete in the coming days for DeMarcus Cousins as well. The team harmed the most, at least in the immediate sense, is OKC. With the amount of top competitors in the West \u2014 Clippers, Lakers, Rockets, Nuggets, Jazz and Blazers among others \u2014 the Thunder likely will take a step back and could enter a semi-rebounding phase without George. Also: Could OKC be forced to part ways with Westbrook? The former MVP struggled at times last season and especially in the playoffs, and turns 31 in November, and is on a max contract. It\u2019s not the type of atmosphere that fits Westbrook, who\u2019ll soon enter his twilight. Thunder GM Sam Presti, if nothing else, has shown a willingness to do whatever it takes if it works for OKC. Lastly, there\u2019s the Raptors, who must now go forward without their lone superstar. There are no other players on the level of Leonard that Toronto can chase this offseason. In addition, the core of their rotation is on expiring contracts \u2014 Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka. The Raptors will surely groom Pascal Siakam to take a lead role with Leonard gone, yet will face major decisions next summer as they attempt to reshape the team. All of this is because Leonard caused a domino effect that ultimately moved mountains. Something of this nature and this magnitude doesn\u2019t happen often in the NBA and is never done virtually overnight, given the amount of pieces involved and teams who put their existence on hold while Leonard stretched his decision nearly a week since free agency began. Evidently there was a reason for that. He wanted the Clippers but only if they could add another major piece. When other options dried up \u2014 Jimmy Butler unexpectedly signing with Miami and Kevin Durant with Brooklyn, for instance \u2014 the Clippers had to go the trade route. And George had to be convinced by Kawhi to force a trade. And OKC had to agree to that, rather than risk going through a season with an unhappy player. When the Clippers coughed up a bevy for draft picks, that put the entire process in motion. And in the end, basketball in LA became the big winner. It would not be unusual or unexpected if the road to the next conference championship goes through Staples Center and gets decided by one of its two home teams. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He will sign a two-year, $30 million deal, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Green posted his decision in a video on social media. \u201cI would just like to announce I\u2019m proudly\u2026let everyone know\u2026 I\u2019m excited for the next two years that I will be teaming up with my new teammates in L.A., the Los Angeles Lakers. Looking forward to playing with those guys. Should be great.\u201d Read more \u2026 \u2014 2:31 a.m. (July 6) ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the LA Clippers have acquired All-NBA swingman Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder. Per Wojnarowski, Leonard had been recruiting George, who reportedly then requested a trade and will arrive exchange for a \u201crecord-setting\u201d package of draft picks and players: Marc Stein of The New York Times later clarified that OKC\u2019s picks broke down to the Thunder\u2019s unprotected firsts in 2022, \u201924 and \u201926, along with Miami firsts in \u201921 (unprotected; acquired in the Tobias Harris trade ) and \u201923 (protected 1-14; acquired in the reported four-team Jimmy Butler trade days ago) as well as pick swaps in \u201923 and \u201925. Read more \u2026 \u2014 2:02 a.m. (July 6) Kawhi Leonard will sign with the LA Clippers, per multiple reports. The news, which was first reported by Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports , will have a tremendous effect on the league. Leonard, a 28-year-old forward, is coming off a championship campaign in his only season with the Toronto Raptors, earning his second NBA Finals MVP in the process. Paul George is also headed to the Clippers after LA traded for the All-Star forward, sending the Oklahoma City Thunder four unprotected first-round picks, one protected first-round pick and two pick swaps, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Read more \u2026 \u2014 1:56 a.m. ET (July 6) It appears Dwight Howard is on the move again. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports the Memphis Grizzlies are acquiring eight-time All-Star Dwight Howard from the Washington Wizards. Moments later, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Memphis is sending veteran wing CJ Miles to Washington in the deal and will waive or trade Howard. Howard, 33, played in only nine games this past season with the Wizards due to a back injury which required surgery. He averaged 12.8 points and 9.2 rebounds while shooting 62.3 percent from the field. Read more \u2026 \u2014 8:54 p.m. (July 5) The Grizzlies do not intend to buy out Andre Iguodala\u2019s contract this summer and are instead exploring trade options, according to ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . The Rockets and Mavericks are among the teams interested in the former Finals MVP, per MacMahon. Iguodala was recently part of a reported three-team, sign-and-trade deal that ended with Golden State shipping him to Memphis and landing All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell from Brooklyn in return. The 35-year-old forward has one year and $17.2 million left on his contract. \u2014 2:06 a.m. (July 4) Point guard Raul Neto has agreed to sign with the 76ers for the veteran\u2019s minimum, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported. Neto is averaging 4.8 points and 1.9 assists in four NBA seasons, all with the Jazz. \u2014 9:20 p.m. (July 3) Restricted free agent forward Jake Layman will join the Timberwolves after they reached a sign-and-trade agreement with the Trail Blazers, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported. Layman will sign a three-year, $11.5-million deal with his new team, per the report. He averaged a career-high 7.6 points last season, his third in the NBA. \u2014 9 p.m. (July 3) The Grizzlies are sending veteran shooter Kyle Korver and guard Jevon Carter to the Suns in exchange for forward Josh Jackson, guard DeAnthony Melton and a pair of second-round picks, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Wojnarowski added that the Suns plan to buy Korver out , with the Lakers, 76ers and Bucks considered front-runners for his services. \u2014 4:35 p.m. (July 3) Another guard is apparently leaving Philadelphia. T.J. McConnell has reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with the Pacers , according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The Sixers are losing McConnell and J.J. Redick , who reportedly is signing with the Pelicans. McConnell provided a spark off the Sixers\u2019 bench, averaging 6.4 points and 3.4 assists in 2018-19. \u2014 3:53 p.m. (July 3) Detroit is reportedly trying its hand at having a Morris twin on its roster, again. Markieff Morris and the Pistons have agreed to a deal, reports Shams Charania of The Athletic and Jordan Schultz of ESPN . Morris began last season with the Washington Wizards, but was dealt to the New Orleans Pelicans at the trade deadline. After being bought out by New Orleans, he signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the rest of the season. He should be a solid addition to the Pistons\u2019 bench, as he averaged 9.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists last season. Markieff Morris\u2019 twin brother, Marcus, played for the Pistons from 2015-17 before being traded to the Boston Celtics in the summer of 2017. \u2014 2:42 p.m. (July 3) Boban Marjanovic is set to head back to the Western Conference. Per multiple reports , the 7-foot-3 center has agreed to a two-year, $7 million deal with the Dallas Mavericks. The big man is coming off his best season in the NBA, having averaged 7.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game in 2018-19 (which he split between the LA Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers). Dallas has been busy in the offseason, reaching reported deals with many of its own players including Kristaps Porzingis , Dwight Powell , JJ Barea , Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith . \u2014 12:35 p.m. (July 3) Although they have yet to make a splash in free agency this summer, the Atlanta Hawks are staying busy in the trade market. Per multiple reports , the Hawks are acquiring veteran forward Chandler Parsons from the Memphis Grizzlies for Solomon Hill and Miles Plumlee. The trade, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , gives Atlanta another veteran it will acquire via trade. The Hawks made a reported trade with the Brooklyn Nets in early June that landed them Allen Crabbe and two first-round picks for Taurean Prince and a future second-round pick. That deal will not be officially completed until at least July 6. Additionally, the Hawks picked up Evan Turner from the Trail Blazers on June 24, sending veteran Kent Bazemore to Portland. Parsons was a solid player in his first five seasons in the NBA, but has been saddled by injuries since signing with the Grizzlies in the summer of 2016. Last season, he averaged 7.5 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 25 games. He, like Turner, is in the final year of his contract and could become a tradeable asset next season. The Hawks reportedly landed Hill in a Draft-night trade that allowed Atlanta to secure the No. 4 overall pick from the Pelicans (who reportedly landed it in the pending Anthony Davis mega-deal ). The pick was originally owned by the Los Angeles Lakers, who picked DeAndre Hunter (and who will eventually end up with the Hawks). As for Hill, he averaged 4.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg and 1.3 apg in 44 games for the Pelicans last season. Plumlee played in Atlanta last season, although sparingly, averaging 4.4 ppg and 2.2 rpg in 18 games (9.6 minutes per game). Both Plumlee and Hill are entering the final year of their contracts. \u2014 11:20 a.m. (July 3) New Orleans reportedly added one 3-point shooter this summer in JJ Redick and have reportedly kept another one in the fold. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Pelicans and forward Darius Miller have agreed on a two-year, $14.25 million deal . Miller has played his entire career with the Pelicans (2012-19), averaging 6 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.4 assists over 253 games in New Orleans. His greatest value to them, though, is his 3-point shooting as he has made 38.2% of them in his career. Last season, Miller ranked 20th in 3-pointers made by reserve players as he shot 94-for-253 (37.2 percent) from deep. \u2014 10:42 a.m. (July 3) The NBA world is waiting for what Kawhi Leonard will decide in free agency. It appears, based on the latest reports, that the road to that choice might be getting just a bit closer. Last night, ESPN\u2019s Jordan Schultz reported via Twitter that Leonard had his meetings with the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers on Tuesday. Now that those meetings are seemingly out of the way, the incumbent Toronto Raptors appear to be up next to pitch to Leonard. Getting a true reading on what is true (and what is false) when it comes to Leonard\u2019s move has been tough to gauge since free agency began at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday. But Doug Smith of the Toronto Star \u2014 as plugged in a Raptors observe as there is \u2014 has some insight on what Toronto may have up its sleeve . Read more \u2026 \u2014 9:40 a.m. (July 3) As Golden State undergoes a bit of an overhaul this summer, one familiar face may have less of a chance of coming back. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports the Warriors have pulled Quinn Cook\u2019s qualifying offer, thus making him an unrestricted free agent. The third-year guard has spent the last two seasons in Golden State and was an important reserve last season. He averaged 6.9 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 74 games during the season and 4.2 ppg and 1.1 rpg in 17 playoff games, too. \u2014 9:24 a.m. (July 3) * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * *"},{"id":46354,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/magic-spurs-summer-league-game-recap","date":"2019-07-06","title":"Game Recap: Magic 75, Spurs 59","content":"By Dan Bruno, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 A magnitude 7.1 earthquake forced cancelation of Friday\u2019s Orlando Magic-San Antonio Spurs game at the Las Vegas Summer League at Cox Pavilion.

Like many in the announced sellout Friday at Thomas & Mack Center, Mayweather scurried for cover before the Pelicans-Knicks game ended abruptly , but by then everyone had saw what they came to see anyway, so no sense in sticking around. Zion Williamson was well worth the tremble, cramming enough awe in his nine minutes of playing time to give a clue, possibly, of what\u2019s coming to New Orleans this season. \u201cWell,\u201d deadpanned Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any earthquakes in our city, and won\u2019t have any, either.\u201d But just as well, Williamson if nothing else will be the next biggest attraction after gumbo in the Big Easy if he takes to the regular season the way he did Summer League. His most vivid play was ripping the ball right out of Kevin Knox\u2019s stunned hands, causing the second-year Knicks forward to spin to the floor in the process, then turning and dunking and flexing a bicep to get a rise out of the arena. Also, Williamson soared for a goal-tending call that was as spectacular as it was illegal, showing that there are few opposing shots that he won\u2019t contest. In all, Williamson scored 11 points before sitting for good after knocking knees with a Knicks player during a second quarter scrum. The good news is Williamson, in nine minutes, put on a show. The potential bad news for anyone holding tickets for New Orleans\u2019 remaining three games is Williamson may not play again in Summer League and if so, just sparingly. Yes, \u201cload management\u201d has come to the NBA Summer League . \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Gentry. \u201cHe has a little tightness in his back. We won\u2019t take any risks or anything. We\u2019ll see how he\u2019s feeling and go from there.\u201d Williamson and teammates were hoarded quickly on the team bus as a result of the earthquake so he wasn\u2019t available for comment. Still, he clearly was amped to return to the floor in an official game, something he hadn\u2019t done since Duke was eliminated in the NCAA tournament in late March. He especially relished the chance to compete against Knicks big man Mitchell Robinson, and vice versa, once Robinson blocked Williamson\u2019s second shot. Robinson blocked another Williamson shot , then raced down for a dunk and shook his head, as if to rub it in. Yet by then, Williamson had a pair of thunderous dunks, a snatch-away from Knox and, yes, an airball. He also shot 3 for 6 from the free throw line and missed five shots from the floor, including his only two from three-point land. And everyone in the building was riveted. \u201cIf he played great or didn\u2019t play great it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d said Gentry. \u201cWe know what we got, and know where he\u2019ll get to. You have to understand, for the last six weeks he\u2019s been on tour. He hasn\u2019t been able to just settle down and work out and do what he loves best and that\u2019s play basketball. He\u2019s going to be great and I\u2019m not worried about it.\u201d Yes, since being drafted by the Pelicans and sending a shot of adrenalin through a franchise that desperately needed a pick-me-up, Williamson has done the rounds in New Orleans with meet-and-greets and a youth clinic. The reviews have been unanimous: Williamson appears happy to be a Pelican and vice versa. \u201cA great kid,\u201d said Gentry. \u201cGreat to be around.\u201d Curiously, one of the biggest applauses in the arena Friday happened when Anthony Davis took his seat next to LeBron James at courtside \u2014 obviously, plenty of Laker fans were in attendance. The former Pelicans All-Star\u2019s arrival in L.A. is greatly anticipated once the trade is official, but just as well, the Pelicans believe they made out fine. Newly-hired team president David Griffin hoarded a batch of future No. 1 picks and\/or first-round swaps from the Lakers in the process, plus added Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, both of whom were also on hand Friday ( and cordially greeted LeBron , now their ex-teammate).

Per Wojnarowski, free agent forward Kawhi Leonard had been recruiting George, who reportedly then requested a trade and will arrive in exchange for a \u201crecord-setting\u201d package of draft picks and players: Marc Stein of The New York Times later clarified that OKC\u2019s picks broke down to the Clippers\u2019 unprotected firsts in 2022, \u201924 and \u201926, along with Miami firsts in \u201921 (unprotected; acquired in the Tobias Harris trade ) and \u201923 (protected 1-14; acquired in the reported four-team Jimmy Butler trade days ago) as well as pick swaps in \u201923 and \u201925. The 29-year-old George, a six-time All-Star coming off his first All-NBA First Team campaign, is one of the league\u2019s most highly regarded two-way threats. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged a career-best 28.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.1 assists while shooting 38.6 percent from 3-point range (9.8 attempts\/game) and 43.8% overall. George was also a finalist for the Kia Defensive Player of the Year award, earning All-Defensive First Team honors for the second time. This comes on the heels of news that reigning Finals MVP Leonard reportedly intends to sign with the Clippers as a free agent. According to Wojnarowski, Southern California natives Leonard (Los Angeles) and George (Palmdale) met earlier in the week . Leonard then \u201c made it clear \u201d to Clippers brass that he would sign if George was coming along. Leonard led the Toronto Raptors to their first NBA championship with a staggering postseason run, reasserting his dominant position among the active player pantheon after an injury-plagued, nine-game 2017-18 season with San Antonio. He\u2019ll team with George for further championship contention in front of family and friends, while Oklahoma City is left to rebuild following yet another megawatt departure. Gallinari, who averaged a career-best 19.8 ppg while shooting 43.3% from deep (46.3% overall) is a capable scorer, though often injured \u2014 having only topped 70 games twice in 11 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander came on strong, quickly settling in as the starting point guard, during an All-Rookie Second-Team campaign after being drafted No. 11 overall by the Clippers. The cache of picks provides multiple avenues for improvement, and the makeover could expand further to involve longtime Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook. Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that word of \u201c the discontent of OKC\u2019s two stars \u201d \u2014 George and Westbrook \u2014 had begun to spread throughout the league. The Athletic\u2019s Sam Amick added that Westbrook\u2019s future with the Thunder \u201c is certainly in question .\u201d"},{"id":32837,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-kawhi-leonard-signs-clippers","date":"2019-07-06","title":"Reports: Kawhi Leonard agrees to sign with LA Clippers","content":" Kawhi Leonard will sign with the LA Clippers, per multiple reports. The news, which was first reported by Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports , will have a tremendous effect on the league. Leonard, a 28-year-old forward, is coming off a championship campaign in his only season with the Toronto Raptors, earning his second NBA Finals MVP in the process. Paul George is also headed to the Clippers after LA traded for the All-Star forward, sending the Oklahoma City Thunder four unprotected first-round picks, one protected first-round pick and two pick swaps, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Further reports indicated that Southern California natives George and Leonard met earlier in the week, which resulted in George asking Oklahoma City for a trade. With the Clippers reportedly worried about Leonard either staying in Toronto (or worse for them) joining the Los Angeles Lakers, a raft of assets was in the offing. The 29-year-old George \u2014 who is owed roughly $105 million for the next three seasons \u2014 spent the last two years alongside Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City. George averaged a career-best 28 points last season even while dealing with shoulder issues that required surgery, and the Thunder couldn\u2019t get out of the first round in either of those seasons. He was a finalist for both NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year last season, when he led the league with 2.21 steals per contest. Raptors president Masai Ujiri acquired Leonard and Danny Green prior to last season in a daring gamble, sending franchise icon DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a protected first-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs in July \u2014 coming off a season Leonard appeared in only nine games while dealing with a right quadricep injury. During the regular season, Leonard averaged 26.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.8 steals in 34.0 minutes across 60 games. But he upped his line across the board in a phenomenal postseason run (30.5 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 3.9 apg) that included the NBA\u2019s first series-clinching buzzer-beater in a Game 7 when he turned back the Philadelphia 76ers on a breathtaking four-bounce 3-pointer in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Leonard ultimately finished the postseason with 732 points, the third-highest total in the history of the NBA playoffs, trailing only Michael Jordan (759; 1992) and LeBron James (748; 2018). Already joining LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to win Finals MVP for multiple teams, Leonard would become the first reigning Finals MVP to play for a different team since the award was first given out in the 1969 Finals. The Toronto exit makes Leonard the third superstar Raptor to leave the team via free agency, following Tracy McGrady (Orlando Magic; 2000) and Chris Bosh (Miami Heat; 2010). The bones of a competitive squad remain for Ujiri and his staff. The team, as it stands, will be led by veterans Kyle Lowry and Marc Gasol, and complemented by rising star Pascal Siakam \u2014 who earned the 2018-19 Kia Most Improved Player award. Their player development program has brought along several players either selected late or unchosen in the draft, providing a depth of talent that allows for an on-the-fly rebuild. The Lakers didn\u2019t wait long before starting to move on from their quest for Leonard. Danny Green announced that he is signing a two-year deal with the Lakers, meaning he, too, is leaving Toronto. \u201cKawhi has made his decision. Seems like the announcement is out,\u201d Green said in a video he posted to his social media accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to make my announcement \u2026 I will be teaming up with new teammates in LA, the Los Angeles Lakers.\u201d Still, Leonard\u2019s decision puts a damper on the Lakers\u2019 offseason quest as well \u2014 even though they will finalize a trade Saturday to bring in Anthony Davis from New Orleans and landed the sort of shooter than LeBron James craves by adding Green. Leonard was, by far, the biggest name left on the free agent market. The other marquee names in this class like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson and Kemba Walker all made their decisions known relatively quickly. And like Durant, Irving and Walker, he\u2019s changing addresses.

With that assurance, games at MGM Resorts NBA Summer League will resume today, 7\/6, as scheduled at 3pm ET.\u201d * * * LAS VEGAS \u2014 An earthquake that struck Southern California on Friday night forced the NBA to cancel the finish of a two Summer League games, including a marquee sold-out matchup between New Orleans and New York, while engineers checked to see if the integrity of the Thomas & Mack Center on UNLV\u2019s campus was compromised in any way by the tremors. The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres played through the earthquake during their game at Dodger Stadium , though a WNBA game in Las Vegas was also stopped. The primary issue at Summer League was the arena\u2019s overhead scoreboard, which is suspended from the roof by cables and swayed noticeably when the quake hit. A game between Phoenix and Denver, scheduled for later Friday in the Thomas & Mack, never started and was ultimately canceled \u2014 and a San Antonio-Orlando game in the adjacent Cox Pavilion, which does not have an overhead scoreboard, was also halted for precautionary reasons. The Magic were leading 75-59 and were declared winners. \u201cSafety comes first, second, third,\u201d Summer League executive director Warren LeGarie said. The Knicks-Pelicans game , the Summer League debuts for No. 1 pick Zion Williamson of New Orleans and No. 3 pick RJ Barrett of New York, was called with 7:53 left and New Orleans leading 80-74. The NBA later decided that the game would end there, with the Pelicans prevailing. NBA officials said late Friday they were going forward with the idea that Saturday\u2019s games in Las Vegas would be played as scheduled. There was a crack found on the court in the Cox arena, though it was barely noticeable and needed only minor repair. \u201cI was bringing the ball up, it felt like someone was pushing my hip, like I kind of leaned this way, and I was like \u2018Oh my gosh, what is going on?\u2019\u201d New Orleans guard Frank Jackson said. \u201cAnd then I just saw everything shaking.\u201d It was a magnitude 6.9 earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said, after initial reports said it was a 7.1 quake. It was centered in the Mojave Desert town of Ridgecrest, some 150 miles from Los Angeles \u2014 but the effects were felt in Las Vegas and Mexico. Friday\u2019s quake would be the largest temblor in the region in 20 years and was centered in the same area as a 6.4 quake that hit a day earlier. \u201cI never remember them coming like this two days in a row,\u201d said New York Knicks coach and California native David Fizdale, who is no stranger to quakes. The WNBA game between the Las Vegas Aces and Washington Mystics was suspended as well, with the Mystics leading 51-36 at halftime. Those teams will decide later how or if to proceed. \u201cDue to the unforeseen earthquake, safety of the players, coaches and fans the WNBA has recommended postponing the completion\u201d of the game,\u201d the Aces said in a statement. New Orleans summer leaguer Christian Wood played college ball at UNLV, and said the quake was an in-game first for him. Play actually continued for a few seconds after the quake, and television cameras captured Pelicans general manager David Griffin looking at the scoreboard and reacting during the few seconds that tremors could be felt in Las Vegas. \u201cGuys didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d Wood said. \u201cSome guys were still playing on the court.\u201d Knicks summer coach Jud Buechler said he wasn\u2019t aware of what was happening until he saw some fans leaving the lower bowl at Thomas & Mack and heading to the concourse, then observed the scoreboard swaying. Barrett was among the players in Las Vegas who also didn\u2019t know what was taking place. \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel the earthquake,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know it happened.\u201d In Los Angeles, the quake was felt when Dodgers second baseman Enriqu\u00e8 Hern\u00e0ndez was batting. It didn\u2019t appear to affect him or Padres pitcher Eric Lauer. However, it was obvious to viewers of the SportsNet LA broadcast when the TV picture bounced up and down. Some fans in the upper deck appeared to leave their seats and move to a concourse at the top of the stadium, and the Dodger Stadium press box lurched for about 20 seconds.

The key for the Pistons was their offensive rebounding, winning that battle 13-6. Three-point shooting was also critical, with the Pistons hitting 16-of-39 and Team Croatia connecting on 8-of-18. The Pistons (1-0) were led by Khyri Thomas, as he tallied 26 points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals. Svi Mykhailiuk finished with 17 points and five assists. Bruce Brown generated 12 points, five rebounds and seven assists while Todd Withers led the bench with 16 points and four boards.  Croatia (0-1) were led by Zeljko Saric, as he accrued 17 points and five rebounds. Luka Babic was the only other player in double figures, leading the bench with 10 points, two rebounds and four assists. Marjan Cakarun also played well off the bench, totaling eight points and seven rebounds.  Detroit returns to action on Saturday, playing host to the Portland Trail Blazers.

Rookie forward Michael Porter Jr. reportedly suffered a left knee sprain in a minicamp scrimmage on Wednesday night and is unlikely to play in Summer League, per Mike Singer of  The Denver Post . Denver selected Porter Jr. with the No. 14 pick in the 2018 draft but he did not play at all last season as he recovered from a back injury that cost him the majority of his freshman season at the University of Missouri. The Nuggets will open Summer League play Friday against the Phoenix Suns ( 11:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). Per The Denver Post , Porter Jr.\u2019s injury is not expected to be a long-term one and the team is being cautious and not wanting to rush him back onto the court. Porter Jr. has taken part in scrimmages over the last few weeks and has looked solid, with the team often posting regular updates and video highlights of the big man\u2019s participation. Although Porter Jr. didn\u2019t play at all last season, he was able to gain valuable experience on the sidelines in Denver. \u201cIt was amazing for me to be able to spend this year to learn the game and be around these guys,\u201d Porter Jr. told Nuggets.com on May 13 . \u201cI learned a lot. Just being around the NBA lifestyle, getting used to the travel, seeing how hard these guys play and the recovery involved. It\u2019s been really good and I think it will really benefit me in the long run.\u201d The 6-foot-11 Porter Jr. has the tools and versatility to play either forward spot in the NBA. Denver took a calculated gamble in deciding to draft Porter Jr. after he surprisingly slid to No. 14 in 2018. Considering their strategic method in helping Porter Jr. rehabilitate from a severe injury, the team will likely take a measured approach in integrating him into the rotation once he is healthy again."},{"id":32901,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kawhi-leonard-unknowns-free-agency-raptors","date":"2019-07-04","title":"Future for Kawhi Leonard remains as unknown as ever","content":"The \u201cKawhi Watch\u201d marches on across the NBA, with a new chapter added to it yesterday. The top free agent left on the market is still deciding where he will sign for the 2019-20 season and beyond, but getting any details or sense on what he may be thinking doesn\u2019t turn up much. Jabari Young of The Athletic has a solid connection with Leonard and covered him when he played for the San Antonio Spurs. Young tweeted last night that Leonard would not make a decision anytime soon, it seems. Via Twitter, Young wrote : \u201cOn the Kawhi front, told he\u2019s not making a decision tonight and it may not be until the next few days. He and his reps are going through the process and taking their time before deciding the next move. No 2-year deals have been discussed.\u201d Via ESPN\u2019s show \u201cGet Up\u201d on Thursday morning, Adrian Wojnarowski said of Leonard: \u201cHe\u2019s going to decide this when he decides this. \u2026 Kawhi Leonard hasn\u2019t made a decision yet.\u201d Doug Smith of the Toronto Star also has more on Wednesday\u2019s latest with Leonard , who by all accounts heard a pitch from the Raptors yesterday: A private plane owned by the group that operates the Toronto Raptors landed Wednesday afternoon at Pearson International Airport in Toronto \u2014 and video footage suggested that Kawhi Leonard was one of the passengers on that plane. The plane\u2019s occupants boarded SUVs on the tarmac and were driven toward downtown Toronto, with at least one news helicopter airing their trip live even though it was not confirmed that Leonard was indeed in one of those vehicles. On Wednesday, a large crowd formed outside a posh downtown hotel where Raptors President Masai Ujiri had been spotted earlier in the day, with the assumption being that the hotel is where the meeting between Leonard and the team may be taking place. Since leading the Raptors to the 2019 NBA title, Leonard was spotted in Niagara Falls with his family and at a Blue Jays game (where he got a lengthy standing ovation). He was also photographed on social media in a subsequent trip to the Bahamas, where he was seen wearing a Blue Jays jersey. So far in free agency, the Raptors have only made one reported move, adding EuroLeague guard Matt Thomas . Swingman Danny Green is an unrestricted free agent this summer and has received interest from the Dallas Mavericks, the Toronto Star reports. However, Green seems to be in no hurry to sign a deal and some have reported he may sign wherever Leonard chooses to go. Leonard turned down his player option for 2019-20, thus becoming an unrestricted free agent, which set off a frenzy of teams officially interested in his services. In leading the Raptors to their first NBA championship, Leonard joined exclusive company en route to being named MVP of The Finals. Only he, LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar can rightfully claim to have won Finals MVP with two different teams (Leonard won his first Finals MVP as a member of the San Antonio Spurs in 2014). Injured for all but nine games in his final season with San Antonio, Leonard played 60 games this season and another 24 in the playoffs. After averaging career bests of 26.6 points and 7.3 rebounds in the regular season, Leonard raised his averages to 30.5 and 9.1 in the playoffs. He scored 732 points in the playoffs. Only Michael Jordan (759) and James (748) ever scored more in a single postseason. Leonard finished with 14 games of 30 points or more in these playoffs. The only players with more in a single postseason are Jordan (16 in 1992), Hakeem Olajuwon (16 in 1995) and Kobe Bryant (15 in 2009). Getting Leonard was just one of a bold series of moves Ujiri made in the last 12 months. He fired last season\u2019s coach of the year in Dwane Casey and hired Nick Nurse. He traded away three players at midseason for Marc Gasol. And he took the risk that Leonard would be both happy enough and healthy enough to take the Raptors to the newest and highest of heights. Shortly after The Finals ended, Ujiri said he and Leonard had talked several times and Ujiri remained confident the Raptors would keep Leonard in the fold going forward. Gasol opted into his contract for next season before free agency began. His path has not been an easy one. He wasn\u2019t highly recruited in high school. By the time bigger colleges were calling, he was committed to San Diego State. He wasn\u2019t even a lottery pick, getting taken No. 15 in the 2011 draft \u2014 behind the likes of Derrick Williams, Tristan Thompson, Jan Vesely, Bismack Biyombo, Jimmer Fredette and Alec Burks, none of whom averaged 10 points per game for their NBA careers.

It appears, based on the latest reports, that the road to that choice might be getting just a bit closer. Last night, ESPN\u2019s Jordan Schultz reported via Twitter that Leonard had his meetings with the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers on Tuesday. Now that those meetings are seemingly out of the way, the incumbent Toronto Raptors appear to be up next to pitch to Leonard. Kawhi Leonard has completed both his meetings with the #Lakers and #Clippers , a league source tells ESPN. He is also meeting with the #Raptors today.

This isn't abnormal at all. \u2014 Josh Lewenberg (@JLew1050) July 3, 2019 Josh Lewenberg of TSN reports that Leonard asked interested teams to not leak information about the recruitment process, but that some media members tracked the Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment plane bound for Toronto today. So far, there has been no information reported in the NBA media-sphere about what direction Leonard may be leaning toward team-wise. Kawhi asked that interested teams not leak info re: the recruitment process. That's not what happened here. Some folks in the media tracked the MLSE plane and followed those that got out of it. Whether Kawhi is bothered by this or not, can't really blame the Raptors for it. \u2014 Josh Lewenberg (@JLew1050) July 3, 2019 Overall, getting a true reading on what is true (and what is false) when it comes to Leonard\u2019s move has been tough to gauge since free agency began at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday. But Doug Smith of the Toronto Star \u2014 as plugged-in a Raptors observer as there is around \u2014 has some insight on what Toronto may have up its sleeve . So, as they make a pitch to free-agent Kawhi Leonard \u2014 likely on Wednesday, as far as anyone can ascertain in these odd and intensely quiet times \u2014 they are certain to go soft on their selling job. All team president Masai Ujiri has ever said publicly about how they will convince Leonard to stay after one memorable, championship season is that the Raptors \u201cwill be who we are\u201d and that is certain to be the message they convey. \u2026 According to every reputable report \u2014 and the cone of silence that has dropped over all three teams is like nothing many have seen \u2014 the Clippers and Lakers were also expected to meet with Leonard on Tuesday and perhaps Wednesday, the final step in a long process of wooing the two-time NBA champion and two-time NBA Finals most valuable player. When Leonard will decide is an equally well-guarded secret, and since there have been as many ridiculously premature \u201creports\u201d as ones based in any semblance of fact, trying to put a time frame on it is a waste of time. The best and most well-connected journalists who cover the three teams and the league have been trying unsuccessfully for days to unearth even a snippet of usable information, and have come up empty. Marc Stein of The New York Times reports the Raptors do not intend to back off at all in their pursuit of Leonard.

Both squads shot well, but the Lakers enjoyed a 41-31 advantage on the boards. Each team also has plenty to clean up after Tuesday\u2019s contest. The Lakers were whistled for 29 fouls, including two technicals, while Golden State was guilty of 21 turnovers. Rookie Zach Norvell, Jr. led the way for the Lakers with 20 points, adding five rebounds, one assist and one steal. Undrafted forward Devontae Cacok supplied a bench-leading 16 points and 12 rebounds, adding two assists, five steals and two blocks. Joseph Young, looking for a path back to the NBA after a season in China, furnished 13 points, seven assists, one rebound and four steals. Marcus Allen totaled 10 points, three assists and one block. Second-round Talen Horton-Tucker did not play due to coach\u2019s decision. Second-round pick Eric Paschall paced the Warriors with 18 points and also compiled three rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Jacob Evans registered 13 points, four assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block. Jordan Poole and Damian Jones generated matching 10-point tallies, with Jones also hauling in eight rebounds. Second-round pick Alen Smailagic led the second unit with 10 points of his own, supplementing them with three rebounds and two assists.

The 27-year-old McGruder spent his first three seasons with the Miami Heat after signing as an undrafted free agent in 2016. Waived on April 7 this year after averaging 7.6 ppg and 3.6 rpg in 23.5 minutes across 66 games with Miami, McGruder was claimed by the Clippers on April 9, though he didn\u2019t appear in a game for LA. ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks quickly noted that the contract, due to McGruder\u2019s existing cap hold, shouldn\u2019t impact the Clippers\u2019 pursuit of reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard in free agency: \u2014 10:34 p.m. Veteran Wilson Chandler is reportedly heading back to the Big Apple, though this time with the Brooklyn Nets , according to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. Drafted No. 23 overall in 2007, Chandler spent his first four seasons with the Knicks, before being sent to the Denver Nuggets in the Carmelo Anthony trade. After signing an extension with Denver in 2015, Chandler was traded to the 76ers last July, and then again to the Clippers in February\u2019s blockbuster for Tobias Harris. Limited to 51 games \u2014 his fewest in five seasons \u2014 Chandler averaged 6.0 points (37.3 3P%) and 4.2 rebounds in 23.1 minutes overall. \u2014 9:14 p.m. After a breakout campaign with the New York Knicks re-established his NBA potential, former lottery pick Emmanuel Mudiay is heading back west, reportedly agreeing to a 1-year deal with the Utah Jazz. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tony Jones of The Athletic delivered the news in rapid succession. Per Wojnarowski : After being drafted No. 7 overall by the Denver Nuggets in 2015 and turning in a solid rookie campaign, Mudiay\u2019s playing time and effectiveness steadily declined until being sent to New York in a three-team deal at the 2018 trade deadline. Last season, given a chance by coach David Fizdale, Mudiay took over a starting role for much of the campaign (59 games), averaging 14.8 points , 3.3 rebounds and 3.9 assists while shooting 44.6 percent in 27.2 minutes for the Knicks. \u2014 8:54 p.m. Luke Kornet has reportedly agreed to a 2-year deal with the Chicago Bulls, per Shams Charania of The Athletic. A 7-foot-1 big with 3-point range, Kornet shot 36.3 percent on 4.2 attempts in 17.0 minutes across 46 games for the New York Knicks. \u2014 8:26 p.m. Jared Dudley provided locker room guidance \u2014 and crucial two-way contributions \u2014 for an up-and-coming Brooklyn Nets squad. He\u2019s now reportedly set to bring that skill set across the country, heading to the Los Angeles Lakers on a one-year, $2.6 million contract, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. In 59 games (25 starts) in Brooklyn, Dudley averaged 4.9 points on 42.3 percent shooting, including 35.1 percent from 3-point range, in 20.7 minutes per game. Wojnarowski further clarified that Dudley, who played in L.A. with the Clippers in 2013-13, was intrigued by the opportunity to compete for the Staples Center\u2019s senior side: \u2014 7:44 p.m. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that well-traveled forward Jeff Green is headed to Utah after agreeing to a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Jazz. Green, known as \u201cUncle Jeff\u201d ever since LeBron James unintentionally bestowed the moniker in Green\u2019s second season, would be joining his eighth NBA team and sixth team in as many campaigns. Last year, he played 77 games for the Washington Wizards, making 44 starts and averaging 12.3 points \u2014 his highest mark since 2014-15 \u2014 and 4.0 rebounds while shooting 47.5 percent overall in 27.2 minutes per game. \u2014 7:28 p.m. The Minnesota Timberwolves have agreed to a one-year deal with forward Noah Vonleh, according to a report from Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic . Vonleh played 68 games for the New York Knicks last season with averages of 8.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.9 assists. \u2014 6:13 p.m. The Golden State Warriors continue to fill their roster with young talent, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic . The Warriors reportedly are expected to sign Glenn Robinson III to a two-year deal with a player option for the second year. The 25-year old forward \u2014 who won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 2017 \u2014 averaged 4.2 points and 1.5 rebounds over 47 games for the Detroit Pistons last season. \u2014 6:05 p.m. Restricted free agent guard Ryan Arcidiacono has agreed to a three-year deal to return to the Chicago Bulls, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic . The undrafted guard out of Villanova averaged 6.7 points, 3.3 assists and 2.7 rebounds over 81 games during 2018-19, his second season in the league. The three-year deal reportedly is worth $9 million. \u2014 5:52 p.m. Report: Ennis returns to Philadelphia  The Philadelphia 76ers are expected to retain forward James Ennis with a two-year deal, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic . Ennis was a key piece for the Sixers\u2019 bench last season with averages of 6.7 points and 3.1 rebounds over 58 games . According the Charania, Ennis turned down larger offers from other teams to return to Philadelphia. His deal with the Sixers is reportedly worth $4.1 million. \u2014 5:45 p.m. The Golden State Warriors are expected to sign center Willie Cauley-Stein, according to reports from Marcus Thompson of The Athletic, Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports and Zach Lowe of ESPN. The 25-year-old center spent the first four seasons of his NBA career with the Kings, who selected him with the No. 6 pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. He averaged 11.9 points and 8.4 rebounds over 81 games last season . According to Lowe, Cauley-Stein is expected to sign a contract worth slightly above the minimum salary. \u2014 5:35 p.m. The Boston Celtics have come to an agreement on a one-year deal with guard Brad Wanamaker, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . Wanamaker was the oldest rookie in the league last season at age 29. He averaged 3.9 points (47.6 FG%) in 9.5 minutes across 36 games with the Celtics. \u2014 5:29 p.m. Center Daniel Theis, one of the Boston Celtics\u2019 more reliable bench performers, is reportedly staying with the team. Theis and the Celtics have agreed on a two-year, $10 million deal, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . The big man has played two seasons in the NBA, logging both of them with Boston. Last season, he averaged 5.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 0.6 blocks per game after posting similar numbers in 2017-18. He is expected to serve as the top backup to the Celtics\u2019 new center, Enes Kanter (who said he agreed to a deal with Boston). \u2014 2:20 p.m. The Philadelphia 76ers may have some changes on tap, but one of them will reportedly not be at point guard. All-Star guard Ben Simmons has been offered a five-year contract extension by the team, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . The Sixers and Simmons\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, are expected to work through the details and eventually reach an agreement, Wojnarowski also reports. Read more \u2026 \u2014 1:30 p.m. Dorian Finney-Smith suffered through an injury-plagued season in 2017-18, but bounced back nicely in 2018-19 for the Dallas Mavericks. His upward growth as Dallas tries to build around youth has apparently led to a new deal for him. Finney-Smith and the Mavs have agreed to a three-year, $12 million deal, reports Shams Charania of The Athletic . Last season, Finney-Smith averaged 7.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game in 81 games (26 starts). \u2014 1:26 p.m. Tony Parker announced in early June that he was retiring from the NBA after a stellar career. Today, the Charlotte Hornets made that fact official in their waiving of Parker\u2019s deal. Selected 28th overall by the Spurs in the 2001 Draft , Parker had said he hoped to play 20 seasons in the NBA. A six-time All-Star, Parker was named to the All-NBA second team three times in his career and was Finals MVP in 2007. He spent the 2018-19 campaign with the Charlotte Hornets, who signed him after the Spurs opted not to bring him back as a free agent last summer. Parker reportedly signed a two-year deal with the Hornets and came off the bench in each of his 56 games last season. Parker stated 1,151 games regular season games and averaged 15.5 points and 5.6 assists per game. He also played in 226 playoffs games, averaging 17.9 points and 5.1 assists per game. \u2014 11:38 a.m. Reigning Kia Sixth Man of the Year winner Lou Williams had his future secured with the LA Clippers last summer. It was at that point he got a three-year deal with the team, which came after a run of changing teams almost annually for Williams. On the heels of his successful 2018-19 season, Williams has gotten a bit of a reward from the Clippers. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, the final year of Williams\u2019 deal in 2020-21 has been fully guaranteed . That maneuver assures Williams of an $8 million payday that season. Last season, Williams averaged 20 points, 3.0 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game as he came off the bench in 74 of his 75 games played. \u2014 10:20 a.m. Kemba Walker essentially said his goodbye to the only NBA city he\u2019s ever called home yesterday in a piece for The Players\u2019 Tribune. Ever since word of his reported deal with the Boston Celtics became public knowledge over the weekend, the Charlotte Hornets have been picking up the pieces. Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer writes via Twitter that should the Hornets go into a full rebuild mode, veterans such as Michael-Kidd Gilchrist, Bismack Biyombo and others could be bought out and then hit the free-agent market: \u2014 9:20 a.m. Forward Anthony Tolliver has agreed to a one-year, $2.6 million deal with the Trail Blazers, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic . Tolliver played in 65 games for the Timberwolves last season, averaging 5.0 points and 2.7 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes of action. \u2014 1:01 a.m."},{"id":32886,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wade-welcomes-butler-miami","date":"2019-07-03","title":"Dwyane Wade welcomes Jimmy Butler to Miami","content":" Jimmy Butler is reportedly heading to the Miami in a four-team trade, but there\u2019s no question that it remains \u201cWade County\u201d as far as the Heat are concerned.

All-Star guard Ben Simmons has been offered a five-year contract extension by the team, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . The Sixers and Simmons\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, are expected to work through the details and eventually reach an agreement, Wojnarowski also reports. Philadelphia has been busy in the offseason since the free-agent negotiating period opened Sunday night. They reportedly reached an agreement with All-Star center Al Horford on a four-year, $109 million deal . In addition, the team also reportedly reached an agreement with forward Tobias Harris on a five-year, $180 million deal . Yesterday, the Sixers reportedly agreed to a four-team, sign-and-trade deal involving guard Jimmy Butler that will net the Sixers Josh Richardson from the Miami Heat. The Sixers also will be losing sharpshooter JJ Redick next season, who reportedly agreed to a deal with the New Orleans Pelicans. Simmons, the Kia Rookie of the Year winner in 2017-18, turned in his first All-Star season with the Sixers in 2018-19. He averaged 16.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 1.4 steals per game in 34.2 minutes per game as Philadelphia reached the Eastern Conference semifinals. He increased both his offensive and defensive rebounding percentage to 6.2 and 17.9, respectively, and ranked eighth overall (among players who logged 25-plus minutes in 50-plus games) with a 34.1 assist percentage. With All-Star center Joel Embiid also in tow, the Sixers had a star-studded lineup even before Horford came aboard. However, there is still work to be done by Simmons as his lack of shooting touch became a talking point in the 2019 playoffs. Defenses sagged on Simmons daring him to shoot because the speedy All-Star can\u2019t do much outside the paint. Simmons is 0 for 17 from 3-point range in two seasons and the ability to expand his game is needed as much as a healthy Embiid. Simmons said in May that he plans to play for Australia in the FIBA World Cup .

(AP) \u2014 All-Star guard Klay Thompson is staying put with the Golden State Warriors. Thompson announced his decision on his Instagram account Monday, using a clip of Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d with the line \u201cI\u2019m not leavin!\u201d\u2018 Thompson\u2019s agent, Greg Lawrence, said later his client will sign a five-year max contract for $190 million when the NBA free agent moratorium period ends. Thompson had always wanted to stay with Golden State, saying last year: \u201cI\u2019ve said it many times before: I would like to be a Warrior for life.\u201d He was scheduled for surgery last week for a torn ACL in his left knee after he was injured during a Game 6 loss to the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals. Neither the Warriors nor Lawrence have said whether it has been done. Along with Splash Brother Stephen Curry, Thompson is part of one of the most dangerous backcourts in the NBA, given their accuracy from 3-point range that extends well beyond the line. He has been durable, too, never missing a postseason game before sitting out Game 3 of this year\u2019s finals because of a strained left hamstring. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said last week he planned to sit down with Thompson before the start of free agency Sunday, when Golden State saw Kevin Durant depart for the Brooklyn Nets . The two-time NBA Finals MVP is recovering from surgery for a torn right Achilles tendon that he injured in Game 5 of the finals. Being part of the Warriors\u2019 dynasty \u2014 five straight NBA Finals berths and three championships in four years from 2015-18 \u2014 appeals to Thompson. He has cherished his role alongside more notable superstars like Curry and Durant, content staying under the radar. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to walk away from something, you were here when it started and yeah, you just want to stay on the train as long as you can,\u201d Thompson said last year. One of the most dynamic shooters in the league, Thompson also is a top defender who often draws the assignment of an opponent\u2019s star player. Thompson scored a career-high 60 points on Dec. 5, 2016, for the highest-scoring performance by a Golden State player in more than 42 years. He scored 40 by halftime in just 18-plus minutes and didn\u2019t even play the fourth quarter of the 142-106 home rout of the Pacers. On Jan. 23, 2015, Thompson scored 37 points in a quarter, making all 13 of his shots in the spectacular shooting performance against the Kings. Golden State now will have Thompson and Curry locked up for the long haul, which will mean so much for the franchise as it moves into new Chase Center in San Francisco next season. Curry received a $201 million, five-year contract last July."},{"id":32927,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-jimmy-butler-heat-sign-trade","date":"2019-07-02","title":"Reports: Heat complete four-team trade for Butler","content":"Jimmy Butler is headed to the Miami Heat in a four-team deal that involves the Heat, Philadelphia 76ers, LA Clippers and Portland Trail Blazers. The trade, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , was later reported by multiple media outlets. The deal reportedly will send Hassan Whiteside to the Trail Blazers , Josh Richardson to the Sixers, Maurice Harkless and a future first-round pick to the Clippers, and Meyers Leonard to the Heat. Butler reportedly met with Miami right when free agency began on Sunday and made it clear that he wanted to join the Heat. He is expected to sign a four-year, $142 million deal. Miami made the deal a day after agreeing to the framework of a move that will also bring Jimmy Butler to the Heat via trade with Philadelphia. The particulars of that trade were still being worked on Monday. Whiteside averaged 12.3 points and a team-best 11.3 rebounds last season, appearing in 72 games and starting 53 of those. He also averaged only 23 minutes per game, and at times expressed his displeasure about not having a larger role. But with Portland, he figures to have a chance at starting right away. For his career, Whiteside has averaged 13.4 points and 11.4 rebounds over parts of seven seasons with Miami and Sacramento. He led the NBA in blocks per game in the 2015-16 season, then led the league in rebounds per game the following season. Harkless averaged 7.7 points last season for the Blazers. Leonard had a 30-point game in Portland\u2019s final game last season, the one where the Trail Blazers were swept out of the Western Conference finals by the Golden State Warriors. He averaged 5.9 points last season, and has spent each of his first seven NBA seasons in Portland. All three of the players involved in the Miami-Portland trade have expiring contracts this season. After arriving from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a November trade that capped one of the 2018 calendar year\u2019s longest-running sagas, Butler proved crucial to the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 ascension toward the top of the Eastern Conference, hitting clutch shots and keeping the offense humming while providing shutdown defense. In 55 games with the 76ers, Butler averaged 18.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.9 steals while shooting 46.7 percent overall and 34.7 percent from 3-point range. Playing alongside a stacked starting five in Philadelphia, particularly after the deadline acquisition of Tobias Harris, Butler averaged fewer than 20 points for the first time since 2014-15. But the ball often ended up in Butler\u2019s hands during crucial moments, both as an initiator and finisher. A four-time All-Star who also earned four All-Defensive Second Team nods in his eight seasons, Butler wields a two-way skill set that has long been held in high regard, though his always-on intensity has occasionally led to infamous flare-ups. Most notably, Butler\u2019s first preseason practice appearance for the Timberwolves last season lit NBA Twitter on fire with its by-the-minute, can-you-break-more updates on scrimmage success and soul-crushing trash talk.

Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Herro, the No. 13 pick of the 2019 NBA Draft , led all scorers with 18 points in the the Heat\u2019s convincing win over the Lakers. The shooting guard out of Kentucky was 5-for-10 from beyond the arc. Julian Washburn, Memphis Grizzlies Washburn, a swingman taken in the 2018 NBA Draft, shot 70 percent from the floor to score an efficient 20 points, including five 3-pointers on six attempts. He played 33 games for the Memphis Hustle of the G League last season, averaging 11.6 points per game.

Thomas, 30, spent all of last season with the Nuggets after brief stints with the Lakers and Cavaliers during the 2017-18 campaign. He averaged 8.1 points and 1.9 assists in 12 games for Denver. The 5-foot-9 point guard is motivated to recapture the All-Star status he earned during his time with the Celtics a few years ago, a period when the Wizards were considered to be Boston\u2019s rival. Thomas, who has played in 44 games the last two seasons combined, hasn\u2019t displayed that same level of basketball since his hip surgery in 2017. The move should ostensibly give Thomas a chance to showcase what he still has to offer with All-Star guard John Wall sidelined with an Achilles injury. \u201cI\u2019m going to get back to a level that I was playing at,\u201d Thomas told ESPN . \u201cI\u2019m excited to show what I can do again.\u201d \u2014 10:39 p.m. Philadelphia is making another addition to its frontcourt. The 76ers are reportedly signing forward Kyle O\u2019Quinn to a one-year, veteran minimum deal, per multiple reports. Just 24 hours earlier Philadelphia reportedly reached an agreement with Al Horford, pairing the veteran forward with center Joel Embiid to create arguably the best big-man tandem in the league. O\u2019Quinn played in 45 games last season for the Pacers, averaging 3.5 points and 2.6 rebounds. \u2014 9:31 p.m. Kevon Looney has agreed to a three-year, $15 million contract to remain with Golden State, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic . The 23-year-old center started in 24 of 80 regular season games last season, averaging 6.3 points and 5.2 rebounds. \u2014 8:08 p.m. Another member from the Warriors\u2019 recent run is on the move. Forward Jordan Bell is reportedly heading to the Timberwolves, according to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . Bell is a restricted free agent, and the Warriors reportedly do not plan to match Minnesota\u2019s offer, per Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle . Letourneau also states the deal is for one year. Golden State has reportedly lost Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala and Bell, but added D\u2019Angelo Russell in a sign-and-trade while agreeing to re-sign Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney. \u2014 6:45 p.m. After searching for another team, or two, to help facilitate a Jimmy Butler trade, it appears the 76ers have found the solution in a complex four-team deal, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Butler met with the Heat right when free agency began at 6 p.m. Sunday and made clear that he wanted to be in Miami. Read More \u2026 \u2014 6:00 p.m. According to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, Toronto has agreed to a three-year deal with EuroLeague guard Matt Thomas. Thomas exercised the opt-out in his contract with Valencia in order to go to the Raptors. Thomas averaged 12.5 points and 1.7 assists in 23 EuroCup games in his rookie season. \u2014 5:54 p.m. Detroit is reportedly adding another point guard to the mix. Tim Frazier has agreed to join the Pistons on a one-year deal, per Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . It\u2019s a veteran\u2019s minimum contract \u2014 according to Rod Beard of The Beard News \u2014 which is about $1.6 million. Frazier, who played with the Bucks and Pelicans last season, joins a Pistons backcourt with Derrick Rose and Reggie Jackson. He averaged 5.3 points, 2.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists last season. \u2014 5:25 p.m. Nerlens Noel was a solid reserve for the Oklahoma City Thunder last season, playing a career-high 77 games while averaging 4.9 points and 1.2 blocks in 13.5 minutes per game. He had initially agreed to return to OKC, but then had second thoughts on doing so days later. Whatever worries he had appear to be gone as he has agreed on a deal \u2014 again \u2014 with the Thunder, per Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . In addition to apparently having Noel back in the fold, the Thunder also secured a deal with veteran guard Alec Burks. He is a decent ball handler and capable 3-point shooter who played for the Utah Jazz, Cleveland Cavaliers and Sacramento Kings last season, averaging 8.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg and 2.0 apg while shooting 36.3 percent on 3-pointers. \u2014 4:48 p.m. A day after reportedly adding point guard in Ricky Rubio , the Suns gain some size, agreeing on a two-year deal with Frank Kaminsky, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. In his four seasons, all with Charlotte, the 26-year-old Kaminsky averaged 9.8 points and 4.0 rebounds. \u2014 4:42 p.m. The Bucks stayed local with their latest edition, agreeing to a deal with former Marquette standout Wesley Matthews, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . The 10-year NBA guard averaged 12.2 points and 2.5 rebounds last season for the Mavericks, Pacers and Knicks. Wojnarowski adds that several playoff contenders were in the hunt for Matthews, who provides veteran leadership while still able to add some offensive punch. \u2014 4:17 p.m. Guard Edmond Sumner has agreed to a three-year deal with the Pacers , sources tell ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The 23-year-old second-year point guard averaged 2.9 points in 23 games for the Pacers last season. \u2014 3:57 p.m. The Kings are adding a bit more size, agreeing on a two-year contract with power forward\/center Richaun Holmes, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic . The 25-year-old Holmes averaged 8.2 points and 4.7 rebounds last season playing for the Phoenix Suns. He\u2019ll be entering his fifth NBA season. \u2014 3:25 p.m. The Dallas Mavericks are bringing back a fan favorite and solid locker room guy, agreeing to re-sign veteran point guard J.J. Barea to a veteran\u2019s minimum deal, according to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania. Barea, 35, averaged 10.9 points and 5.6 assists in just 19.8 minutes per game last season for Dallas. \u2014 3:14 p.m. Taking a page of sorts from one of his former teammates, center Enes Kanter revealed where he will be playing next season. Via a post on social media \u2014 which came shortly after Shams Charania of The Athletic broke the news \u2014 Kanter said he has agreed to a deal with the Celtics. Per Charania, Kanter will get a two-year, $10 million deal from Boston. The Celtics are reportedly losing their current center, Al Horford, to the Philadelphia 76ers after he reportedly agreed to a deal with them yesterday. Much like Kevin Durant a day earlier, Kanter \u2014 who played with Durant on the Oklahoma City Thunder from 2014-16 \u2014 is headed to an Eastern Conference team. Kanter was key to the Portland Trail Blazers reaching the Western Conference finals as he became their starting center once Jusuf Nurkic was lost for the season. He averaged 13.1 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.4 steals during the season for Portland and 11.4 ppg, 9.7 rpg and 1.2 apg in the playoffs. \u2014 2:26 p.m. Youth continues to be served in Dallas as second-year forward Maxi Kleber is poised to get a big payday. Per Marc Stein of The New York Times , Kleber and the Mavs have agreed on a four-year, $35 million deal . Undrafted in 2017, Kleber has shown steady development and is coming off a solid season in which he averaged 6.8 points and 4.6 rebounds in 21.2 minutes per game. \u2014 2:14 p.m. New York continues to be active in free agency by adding young players, with Monday\u2019s reported move being no different. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, point guard Elfrid Payton has agreed to a two-year, $16 million deal with New York. The news was also reported by Ian Begley of SNY.tv . The reported deal Payton struck with New York comes hours after the team reportedly landed shooting guard Wayne Ellington. A day earlier, the Knicks came to reported agreements with Julius Randle , Bobby Portis , RTaj Gibson and Reggie Bullock . Payton played last season with the New Orleans Pelicans and started off well before a thumb injury forced him to miss a stretch of 31 out of 32 games. His top individual highlight occurred in March, when he set a Pelicans record by logging five consecutive triple-doubles . \u2014 1:48 p.m.  When free agency opened, the Los Angeles Lakers were expected to make some of the biggest noise of the offseason. That hasn\u2019t been the case just yet, but they have got their first free-agent move on the board. Per multiple reports \u2014 and first reported by The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania \u2014 forward Troy Daniels has agreed to a one-year, $2.1 million deal with the Lakers. The journeyman has spent the last two seasons with the Phoenix Suns and has a solid 3-point stroke. Last season, he made 38.1 percent of his 3-pointers and averaged 6.2 points per game as a reserve. \u2014 1:33 p.m. The Golden State Warriors have managed to loop the Minnesota Timberwolves in on the sign-and-trade deal that will send D\u2019Angelo Russell to the Bay Area. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Warriors and Brooklyn Nets have outlined a sign-and-trade deal that will deliver Russell to Golden State on a four-year, $117 million deal. The sign-and-trade deal will include Golden State sending a protected future first-rounder to Brooklyn and re-routing Shabazz Napier, Treveon Graham and cash to the Timberwolves. Read More \u2026 \u2014 1:04 p.m. Guard Austin Rivers will be back for another go at it with the Houston Rockets, it seems. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Jonathan Feigen both report Rivers has agreed to a two-year deal with Houston. The Rockets acquired Rivers in December of last year after he was waived by the Phoenix Suns. He became a valuable contributor for them off the bench, averaging 7.2 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game in 29 games. In the 2019 playoffs, he posted similar numbers \u2014 7.4 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 1.0 apg \u2014 as the Rockets fell to the rival Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals. \u2014 12:58 p.m. The Miami Heat are looking to lock up a sign-and-trade deal for guard Jimmy Butler to give it a star player to build around in the future. As that takes place, the big man it once considered one of its go-to guys is apparently on the move. Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald reports the Heat are trading Whiteside to the Portland Trail Blazers for big men Meyers Leonard and Maurice Harkless. News of the deal was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The trade was also reported by Ira Winderman of the Sun-Sentinel. Read more \u2026 \u2014 12:48 p.m. The Dallas Mavericks are bringing a familiar face back to the fold, it seems. Per Marc Stein of The New York Times and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN , the Mavs have agreed to a deal with sharpshooting reserve guard Seth Curry. He played for the Mavs in 2016-17, averaging a career-best 12.8 points per game while also shooting 42.5 percent on 3-pointers. Last season with the Portland Trail Blazers, Curry averaged 7.9 ppg and 45 percent on 3-pointers as he was one of the NBA\u2019s top reserve 3-point shooters in catch-and-shoot and pull-up situations. \u2014 12:38 p.m. The Kemba Walker era is seemingly over in Charlotte, as the Hornets\u2019 star guard reportedly agreed to a four-year maximum deal with the Boston Celtics yesterday. While Walker is set to move on from the only NBA state and city he\u2019s ever known, he made it clear in a piece he wrote for The Players\u2019 Tribune that Charlotte will always have a fond place in his heart. In a story titled \u201c Boston, Let\u2019s Do This \u201d on the website, Walker reflected on his days with the Hornets starting from when he was drafted by the then-Charlotte Bobcats with the No. 9 pick in the 2011 Draft. It was a Draft-night conversation with Hornets owner Michael Jordan that made a big impact on Walker back in 2011. Read more \u2026 \u2014 12:07 p.m. Over the final 12 games of the 2018-19 season, Michael Carter-Williams proved to be a solid player for the Orlando Magic as they charged toward the playoffs. He was solid in playoffs, too, and that play may have helped secured him another year in Orlando. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Carter-Williams has agreed to a one-year deal with the Magic . The former Kia Rookie of the Year winner averaged 5.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.1 assists in 12 games for Orlando, then went for 6.6 ppg, 4.0 rpg and 2.4 apg in the playoffs as Orlando lost in five games in the first round to the eventual-champion Toronto Raptors. \u2014 11:26 a.m. Early Monday morning, the Sacramento Kings and guard Cory Joseph reportedly agreed to a deal . As with just about any free-agent deal in the works, it affects more than just one player on the roster. Such is the case for Willie Cauley-Stein, who had his qualifying offer from the Kings pulled so the team would have enough salary cap room for Joseph\u2019s looming deal. Per Jason Anderson of The Sacramento Bee , who reported the news, this give Cauley-Stein his long-sought wish for an exit from Sacramento. The Kings landed Cauley-Stein with the No. 6 pick in the 2015 draft and he averaged 11.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game last season. \u2014 11:21 a.m. Another day, another smaller-scale move for the New York Knicks, it seems. This time, the Knicks are apparently addressing a key need from last season, 3-point shooting. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Knicks have agreed to a two-year deal with former Detroit Pistons marksman Wayne Ellington. The Knicks ranked 24th in 3-pointers made last season, were 28th in 3-point percentage and were 21st in the percentage of shots they took from 3-point range. Ellington averaged a career-best 12 points per game last season and shot 37.3 percent on 3-pointers. He has never shot worse than 32.4 percent in any of his 10 NBA seasons. \u2014 10:40 a.m. As a part of the looming D\u2019Angelo Russell-to-Golden State trade, the Warriors are reportedly sending Andre Iguodala to the Memphis Grizzlies for a protected first-round pick . Whether or not Iguodala would want to stay with a young team like the Grizzlies remains to be seen (provided the deal goes through). If Iguodala does end up getting bought out by the Grizzlies at some point, Tim MacMahon reports the Houston Rockets would have a strong interest in adding him . \u2014 10:33 a.m. Although it is not an official transaction just yet, the Los Angeles Lakers got the 2019 offseason rolling with their reported trade for New Orleans Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis in mid-June . The Lakers will reportedly send Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks to the Pelicans in a trade that is not expected to be ratified until July 6 at the earliest. Since then, Lakers star LeBron James has reportedly given up his No. 23 jersey to Davis (who has worn that number in entire NBA career) and Davis has been announced as one of the cover athletes for the \u201cNBA 2K20\u201d video game . Despite all this news about Davis, nothing has been heard from Davis of late. That changed on Monday morning as Davis chatted with Arash Markazi of the Los Angeles Times about living in Los Angeles, shared some thoughts on James and more. Although he wouldn\u2019t talk specifically about the pending trade, Davis did discuss other topics of note. Read more \u2026 \u2014 10:08 a.m. In the 2019 draft, the Chicago Bulls picked point guard Coby White to be their playmaker of the future. As he learns the NBA trade, it seems they might be turning the keys to the offense over to a more tested veteran for the time being. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Bulls are acquiring former Wizards guard Tomas Satoransky via a sign-and-trade deal with Washington. The deal is expected to be for three years and $30 million, Wojnarowski reports . The move was also confirmed by David Aldridge of The Athletic , who notes the Wizards are talking with Isaiah Thomas as a possible replacement for Satoransky. K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reports that the Bulls are sending a 2020 second-round pick and the rights to swap a future second-round pick in the deal. Satoransky was drafted by the Wizards with the No. 32 pick in the 2012 draft and made his NBA debut in the 2016-17 season. He spent his entire career with the Wizards, averaging 6.6 points, 2.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. He had a breakout season in 2018-19, averaging 8.9 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 5.0 apg as he took on a bigger role, starting 54 games as star guard John Wall was lost for the season in February. \u2014 8:31 a.m. The Washington Wizards know they will be without John Wall until at least late in 2019-20 after their star point guard had surgery on his left Achilles earlier this year. Tomas Satoransky, who has been Wall\u2019s top backup, is reportedly on his way to the Chicago Bulls in another deal. No matter what happens with Satoransky, the Wizards have given themselves some form of point guard insurance by reportedly reaching a deal with veteran guard Ish Smith. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Smith has agreed to a two-year, $12 million deal . Smith, a journeyman in the NBA, has become a solid backup point guard over the last few seasons. He spent the past three seasons with the Detroit Pistons, averaging 9.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game in 219 games during that span. \u2014 8:14 a.m. The Miami Heat were not thought to be big players in free agency this summer, but that changed when everything opened on Sunday night. Per multiple reports, the Heat are trying to put the finishing touches on a sign-and-trade deal with the Philadelphia 76ers that will land them guard Jimmy Butler. The swingman has reportedly agreed to a four-year, $142 million deal , but Miami and Philadelphia were still working out some aspects of the swap, such as the addition of Dallas as the third team. The Heat are reportedly sending Josh Richardson to Philadelphia as part of the deal and, at one point, guard Goran Dragic was on the move to Dallas in the trade. However, the status of the deal seems to be held up as of early Monday morning. Read more \u2026 \u2014 4:51 a.m. In agreeing to reported  deals with Bogdan Bogdanovic and Ed Davis in the opening hours of Sunday\u2019s frenzy, the Utah Jazz have moved in a different direction with some of their frontcourt for 2019-20.  That means Derrick Favors, who has been with the Jazz since 2011, is on his way out of town and headed a little closer to his home state of Georgia. Per multiple reports, the New Orleans Pelicans are set to acquire Favors via a trade. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Pelicans are sending 2012 and 2023 picks \u2014 which are both from the Golden State Warriors \u2014 to the Jazz as part of the deal. \u2014 4:28 a.m. The Sacramento Kings are trying to keep pace in the Western Conference roster-building race this offseason. They started out by getting Harrison Barnes to agree to a new deal and adding spring center Dewayne Dedmon as well, too. Attention has reportedly shifted to the backcourt as the Kings and veteran point guard Cory Joseph have agreed to a three-year, $37 million deal, reports Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. Joseph spent the last two seasons with the Indiana Pacers, and before that logged two seasons with the Toronto Raptors after spending his first four NBA seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. Overall, he has career averages of 6.9 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 528 career games. \u2014 3:20 a.m. Reggie Bullock becomes the latest reported addition for the Knicks, who continue to add role players after missing out on superstar talent. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that Bullock will sign with New York for two years and $21 million. The 28-year-old swingman played 63 total games with the Lakers and Pistons last season, averaging 11.3 points while shooting 37.7 percent from 3-point range. \u2014 2:19 a.m. Patrick Beverley has made a career out of scrapping for everything he earns. It paid off early Monday morning when he confirmed reports of his return to the Clippers for a three-year, $40 million contract. Beverley served as a veteran leader and defensive pest for the Clippers, who defied expectations en route to 48 wins and taking the Warriors to six games in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. The former second-round pick averaged 7.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists last season, his seventh in the NBA and second with LA. \u2014 1:29 a.m. After coming within a game of the Western Conference finals, Denver is reportedly ensuring its young core remains intact. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that the Nuggets have come to terms on a five-year, $170 million extension for Jamal Murray . The seventh overall pick in the 2016 Draft, Murray averaged career-highs in points (18.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (4.8) per game last season. Murray (22) joins Nikola Jokic (24) and Gary Harris (24) as young, key players that Denver has under contract for the foreseeable future. The Nuggets extended the Portland Trail Blazers to Game 7 in the Western Conference semifinals, the end of the franchise\u2019s first postseason appearance since 2013. \u2014 12:44 a.m. The Knicks continue to gather frontcout help, this time from Washington. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that New York and Bobby Portis have come to terms on a two-year, $31 million offer sheet. Because he is a restricted free agent, Portis could remain with the Wizards if they decide to match the Knicks\u2019 offer. Fred Katz of The Athletic, however, reports that Washington has no plans to do so. In 50 total games divided between the Bulls and Wizards last season, Portis averaged 14.2 points and 8.1 rebounds while shooting a career-high 39.3 percent from 3-point range. \u2014 12:19 a.m. The 76ers are reportedly bringing back veteran Mike Scott on a two-year deal, per Shams Charania of The Athletic . \u2014 12:08 a.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft"},{"id":32894,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-cavaliers-summer-league-recap","date":"2019-07-02","title":"Game Recap: Spurs 97, Cavaliers 89","content":"Nick Whalen, Rotowire SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 97-89 in the opening game of the Salt Lake City Summer League at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday. San Antonio was able to escape with a victory as both teams opened play in Utah. It actually took five ties and 13 lead changes to determine a winner, with neither team ever building a double-digit lead. The third quarter ended up being key for the Spurs, as they rode a 27-19 third quarter to victory and never trailed in the fourth quarter. Defensive rebounding was critical for San Antonio, as the Spurs won that battle by a margin of 26 to 17. The Spurs shooting was also on point, hitting 63 percent from the field and 42 percent from three-point range while holding the Cavaliers to 45 percent from the field and 25 percent from long range.  The Spurs (1-0) were led by 2018 first-round pick Lonnie Walker IV, who tallied 20 points, seven rebounds, and two assists on 8-of-12 from the field. Luka Samanic a 2018 first-rounder, finished with 11 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Meanwhile, Drew Eubanks amassed 13 points and four boards, while Quinndary Weatherspoon led the bench with 13 points, three rebounds and two assists.  The Cavaliers (0-1) were led by a first-round pick of their own, Dylan Windler, who accrued 19 points, four rebounds, six assists and two steals on 8-of-14 shooting. Naz Mitrou-Long generated 16 points, four rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Malik Newman was the only other player in double figures, as he scored 16 points in an otherwise empty stat line. Both teams will return to action on Tuesday, with San Antonio playing the Memphis Grizzlies and Cleveland facing the Utah Jazz.

Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Warriors and Brooklyn Nets have outlined a sign-and-trade deal that will deliver Russell to Golden State on a four-year, $117 million deal. The sign-and-trade deal will include Golden State sending a protected future first-rounder to Brooklyn and re-routing Shabazz Napier, Treveon Graham and cash to the Timberwolves. Minnesota\u2019s involvement is something of a surprise, given that they had aggressively pursued Russell as a sign-and-trade, as notably detailed by Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic. Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns, drafted No. 1 overall ahead of Russell (No. 2) in 2015, posted an Instagram story Saturday night that included an apparent nod to his close friend\u2019s \u201cD-Loading\u201d nickname (and social media handle\/hashtag), which began to excite many in the Minnesota fan base. Yet the Warriors knew that Kevin Durant was headed to the Nets and apparently decided to chart an alternate course, clearing a path for Brooklyn\u2019s All-Star point guard to head cross-country and join them. That left the Timberwolves on the outside looking in. Shams Charania of The Athletic first reported the acquisition was near and would also include Graham and Napier. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski soon confirmed the deal , as did Mark Medina of The Mercury News . In making this move, Medina writes, it appears unlikely the Warriors will retain free agents such as DeMarcus Cousins, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko and Andrew Bogut. The Warriors own the Bird Rights to big man Kevon Looney, which will allow them to go over the salary cap to retain him if they so choose. Russell, originally drafted No. 2 overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2015, developed into an All-Star in Brooklyn. He averaged a career-best line (21.1 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 7.0 apg, 43.4 FG%, 36.9 3P%) while leading the Nets to the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. They fell to the Sixers, 4-1, in the first round. Napier established a role as a scoring guard off the bench (9.4 ppg, 17.6 mpg in 56 games). Graham, a swingman signed as a free agent heading into the season, provided spot duty across 35 games (5.3 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 20.4 mpg) Around the same time, Wojnarowski reported that \u2014 in a tangentially related maneuver \u2014 the Warriors would be trading Andre Iguodala to the Memphis Grizzlies, with a protected 2024 first-round pick attached. Iguodala, who earned Finals MVP recognition in 2015, averaged 5.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 23.2 minutes last season, his 15th. The 35-year-old\u2019s contract, per ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks, now comes off the Warriors books and slots into an exception the Grizzlies held as a result of the reported trade of Mike Conley Jr. to the Utah Jazz."},{"id":32920,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-jersey-retire-official-release","date":"2019-07-01","title":"Warriors CEO Joe Lacob releases statement on Kevin Durant","content":" Golden State Warriors Co-Chairman and CEO Joe Lacob released the following statement on Monday: \u201cThree years ago, we were thrilled with the arrival of Kevin Durant, a transformative NBA player and one of the best to ever play the game.

Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald reports the Heat are trading Whiteside to the Blazers for big men Meyers Leonard and Maurice Harkless. News of the deal was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The trade was also reported by Ira Winderman of the Sun-Sentinel. The deal reportedly is tied to a four-team trade that will send All-Star Jimmy Butler to the Heat, who needed to clear cap space in order to acquire Butler in a sign-and-trade. Whiteside was a marquee free agent in the summer of 2016, when he signed a four-year, $98 million deal with the Heat. He responded with a career season in 2016-17, averaging 17 points, 14.1 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game for Miami. However, his game and role with Miami have been on the decline since then. He is entering the final season of a four-year, $98 million contract. He lost his starting spot to Bam Adebayo in the second half of last season, but figures to offer frontline depth to a Trail Blazers team that lost center Jusuf Nurkic to a broken leg late last season. In 2017-18, he averaged 14 ppg, 11.7 rpg and 1.7 bpg, but was limited to 54 games because of a myriad of various injuries. That season was trying for Whiteside and the Heat as he was a nonfactor for Miami in its first-round series loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. He complained at the time about how he was being utilized by coach Erik Spoelstra, something team president Pat Riley made clear he wasn\u2019t happy with. Whiteside dealt with injuries during the season and didn\u2019t want to wear a knee brace that the Heat insisted upon, and Riley said that if Whiteside and Spoelstra need an intervention to solve their relationship issues \u2013 if any \u2013 he\u2019ll handle it. Last season, he averaged 12.3 ppg, 11.3 rpg and 1.9 bpg as the Heat featured Josh Richardson as their go-to player throughout the season. Richardson is thought to be a player included in the looming Butler deal, which has been held up by a series of snags. The Blazers have been plenty busy in the offseason, trading reserve Evan Turner to the Atlanta Hawks for Kent Bazemore before free agency opened. The Blazers reportedly are trying to sign star guard Damian Lillard to a \u201csupermax\u201d deal this offseason and reportedly set to re-sign Rodney Hood and add guard Mario Hezonja as well in free agency. Harkless averaged 7.7 points last season for the Blazers. He reportedly will go to the Clippers as part of the four-team deal . Leonard had a 30-point game in Portland\u2019s final game last season, the one where the Trail Blazers were swept out of the Western Conference finals by the Golden State Warriors. He averaged 5.9 points last season, and has spent each of his first seven NBA seasons in Portland. All three of the players involved in the Miami-Portland trade have expiring contracts this season. Blazers guard CJ McCollum gave a farewell message to Leonard and Harkless via Twitter, writing: \u201cGonna miss y\u2019all man. Losing some great people and teammates. Hope y\u2019all do y\u2019all thang in mia. I\u2019ll be hitting y\u2019all lines.

That\u2019s when Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA\u2019s newly minted Kia Most Valuable Player, can sign a \u201csupermax\u201d contract extension worth approximately $254 million over five years. Or not. And the \u201cor not\u201d might have gotten a nudge on the first day of 2019 free agency Sunday . The Bucks were in a tough situation as it was, with three free agents among the top five players from last season\u2019s 60-22 team. Keeping all of them \u2013 wing Khris Middleton, center Brook Lopez and guard Malcolm Brogdon \u2013 was going to be a challenge, financially and realistically, given how much demand was outstripping supply in the marketplace (nearly $500 million in available cap space plus exceptions burning holes in 30 teams\u2019 pockets). Milwaukee started scrambling in the days heading toward June 30 by moving or trying to move pieces such as Tony Snell, George Hill and Ersan Ilyasova for payroll and roster flexibility. Snell\u2019s contract was traded to Detroit along with the No. 30 pick in the 2019 Draft, Hill was waived and Ilyasova essentially was sitting at the curb with a \u201cFree\u201d sign on him and his $7 million salary. It wasn\u2019t enough. The free agent-palooza started well enough for the Bucks when reports leaked early that Lopez would be retained on a four-year, $52 million deal. Frankly, that\u2019s a bargain \u2014 $55 million over five years \u2013 if you add Lopez\u2019s 2019-20 salary of $3.4 million, a ridiculously low rate for what wound up as a career-redefining season for the veteran big man. After taking a mere 0.5 percent of his 6,826 field goal attempts from 3-point range through his first eight seasons, Lopez let fly 65 percent of his shots from beyond the arc in his 11th. In hard numbers, that\u2019s 31 attempts over eight years compared to 512 in 81 appearances for the Bucks. Factor in Lopez\u2019s underrated defense and rim protection, and his free-spirit calm in the locker room, and he ranked arguably as the Bucks\u2019 next most valuable player after Antetokounmpo. Soon thereafter, Milwaukee\u2019s next move was reported: Middleton re-upping on an enormous five-year, $178 deal . The soft-spoken 6-foot-7 was named an East All-Star reserve en route to averaging 18.3 points and shifting even more of his offensive game to 3-point territory. But Middleton\u2019s greatest leverage was being viewed as the Bucks\u2019 No. 2 player overall and Antetokounmpo\u2019s Scottie Pippen (relatively) for the past six seasons. And hey, his contract represents a $12 million discount from the $190 million \u201cmax\u201d Middleton could have demanded. As it is, starting at an estimated $30.6 million salary, he\u2019ll be getting about $5 million more than Antetokounmpo both this season and next. So two done and one \u2026 not done. Not done at all. Just when it appeared the Bucks would take care of their most pressing free-agency issues, the news came: Brogdon to Indiana on an $85 million deal over four seasons. In a sign-and-trade , which meant Milwaukee facilitated the restricted free agent\u2019s departure, rather than match the Pacers\u2019 offer and keep him. Brogdon\u2019s value last season, to a team that got within two victories of The Finals, was evident analytically and by most eye tests. He became only the eighth shooter in NBA history to hit 50 percent of his shots overall, 40 percent of 3s and 90 percent of his free throws. He also showed an uncanny ability to take over for minutes at a time when the Bucks were desperate to generate offense. Brogdon\u2019s threat as shooter enabled him to attack the rim at a high percentage, stopping opponents\u2019 runs or sparking them for his side. Brogdon\u2019s relationship with the Bucks seemed to get strained two years ago, when his reward for being named an unlikely Kia NBA Rookie of the Year was 20 bench appearances in the team\u2019s first 37 games. Here Brogdon had won the award over the likes of Dario Saric, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown (Joel Embiid only made 31 appearances in 2016-17), yet his role was unclear once Phoenix made Eric Bledsoe available and Milwaukee pounced. Bledsoe pre-empting his own free agency by signing a four-year, $70 million deal with the Bucks raised questions about Brogdon\u2019s spot in their pecking order again. So too, it appears, did Milwaukee nailing down the East\u2019s No. 1 seed, then going 7-1 in the first two playoff rounds while Brogdon nursed a plantar fascia foot injury from mid-March into May. All of a sudden Brogdon\u2019s deal was looking like the one to blame for pushing Milwaukee\u2019s payroll up, up, up into luxury-tax range. And so he was sacrificed to Indiana, an Eastern Conference rival, for a reported first-round draft pick and a couple second-rounders, protections and years still not known. Bucks GM Jon Horst made a nice save in pulling back Hill from the free-agent pool, to the tune of a three-year, $29 million deal. But losing Brogdon was a considerable step backward for a team determined to go forward. Shedding Snell and having Nikola Mirotic head off to the Euroleague to play in Barcelona doesn\u2019t help. As for the draft picks from Indiana and the $12 million trade exception the Bucks might have gained in the trade, the former are out of sync with the team\u2019s life cycle \u2013 namely, Antetokounmpo\u2019s ambitions and contract status \u2013 and the latter only matters if it\u2019s used smartly. Everything Milwaukee does \u2013 has done, actually, since those four staggered defeats against Toronto in the conference finals \u2013 has to be about giving Antetokounmpo reasons to stay. That means improving, that means winning, that means at least being in the building when the championship is decided next June. The clock is ticking. The social media vultures will be circling for \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d soon. There is only one way to fend them off, and a part of that now will be playing for the Pacers. Horst, 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, and Mike Budenholzer, NBA Coach of the Year, might need to repeat if they and their team are going to chase the trophies \u2013 the Larry and the Giannis \u2013 that matter most. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

While Walker is set to move on from the only NBA state and city he\u2019s ever known, he made it clear in a piece he wrote for The Players\u2019 Tribune that Charlotte will always have a fond place in his heart. In a story titled \u201c Boston, Let\u2019s Do This \u201d on the website, Walker reflected on his days with the Hornets starting from when he was drafted by the then-Charlotte Bobcats with the No. 9 pick in the 2011 Draft. It was a Draft-night conversation with Hornets owner Michael Jordan that made a big impact on Walker back in 2011. \u201cHe called me up\u2026.. and of course I recognized his voice instantly,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201c(I remember thinking, even in that moment, you know, like \u2014 Damn. It\u2019s MIKE. ) And real calm, real cool, he just said, \u2018Kemba, we believe in you. I want you to know that. We believe in you, and we expect great things.\u2019 \u201cTo some people, that probably sounds like any old pep talk. But what you have to understand is \u2014 it\u2019s like I said: It\u2019s MIKE . It\u2019s Air Jordan! It\u2019s the greatest, period. And you have the greatest, period, not just drafting you with this high pick\u2026.. but then also talking about how he expects greatness out of you? \u201d Jordan and Hornets president of basketball operations Mitch Kupchak both issued statements today about Walker\u2019s pending departure. \u201cOn behalf of the entire Hornets organization, I want to thank Kemba for eight incredible seasons with our franchise,\u201d Jordan said in a statement. \u201cHe always represented the Hornets, the NBA and the city of Charlotte with class \u2013 both on the court and in the community \u2013 and we are disappointed he is leaving. He\u2019s a special player, with a tremendous heart and tireless work ethic. Kemba is truly one of the best to ever play for our team. We wish him and his family all the best in the future.\u201d Walker made a particular point to talk about playing in Charlotte and how much he adored Hornets fans. \u201cI think because the Hornets are a younger franchise in this league, people get the idea that their fans are maybe more of the casual type. But if you\u2019ve spent any time in Carolina, you know that isn\u2019t the case at all. Hoops culture \u2014 it runs deep in that area. They understand it and they respect it. So a place like that\u2026.. when they take you in as one of their own? And they believe in you, and they always have your back, no matter what? That means everything. \u201cAnd I just wanted to say thank you to them.\u201d Walker stands as the Hornets\u2019 all-time leading scorer and ranks in the franchise\u2019s top five in assists (No. 2), games played (No. 3), defensive rebounds (No. 4) and steals (No. 3). He did not appear to hold any ill will toward the team in his Players\u2019 Tribune piece. \u201cI just want to address the entire Hornets organization, top to bottom,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cI regret that we weren\u2019t able to get to that next level, and do a little more than we did. But even if we fell short of some of our goals \u2014 that doesn\u2019t change how proud I am of what we built here together. \u201cThis place is special. And while this summer was the right time for me to part ways, and move on to another phase in my career \u2014 it\u2019s taking nothing away from the Hornets as a fan base or as a franchise. If anyone in the league asked for my advice? I\u2019d encourage them to sign with you all, without hesitation. I\u2019d tell them how it\u2019s a place full of not just great basketball people, but great people \u2014 and that things are headed in the right direction.\u201d After his lengthy address to Charlotte and its fans, he made a promise to Celtics fans and gave them an idea of what to expect from him next season and beyond. \u201cI\u2019m a leader in my own way. I\u2019m never going to shout anyone off the court, or get overly negative. It\u2019s not my style,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cBut what I do is I take pride in making my teammates better \u2014 I\u2019m that lead by example type. I like to keep it direct. \u2026 Every year, my goal is simple: to get better, and go farther. \u201cI take my responsibilities as a professional very seriously \u2014 but I also try not to lose sight of why I\u2019m here in the first place. I love this game. So we\u2019re going to grind for those buckets\u2026.. we\u2019re going to grind for those stops\u2026.. but I\u2019ll tell you what else: we\u2019re going to have some fun out there. And you can bet we\u2019re going to be fun to watch.\u201d Walker played his college basketball in Storrs, Connecticut, less than 90 miles from Boston and is still revered after leading the Huskies to the 2011 NCAA title. UConn beat Butler \u2014 coached by now-Celtics coach Brad Stevens \u2014 in that championship game. Walker\u2019s departure will be a major blow for the Hornets, who \u2014 barring a late sign-and-trade, which does not seem likely \u2014 will lose their franchise player for nothing. Walker\u2019s departure comes a few weeks after backup point guard Tony Parker, the longtime San Antonio standout who played with Charlotte last season, announced his retirement from the NBA.

This group includes 2015 first round draft picks who had their third and fourth-year options picked up and just completed their rookie contract, as well as other players who have played three or fewer seasons in the league. Restricted free agency allows the team to match any offer the player receives from another team. But in order to have that right, the team must have issued the player a qualifying offer by Sunday. If a qualifying offer wasn\u2019t issued, that player is an unrestricted free agent instead. The qualifying offer is binding as a one-year contract. If the player signs it, he\u2019s under contract for next season. He could also sign an offer sheet from another team (which his team would have the ability to match), and he and his team could agree on a new, multi-year contract.

That\u2019s all part of my legacy, and I think that\u2019s way more valuable than any monetary value.\u201d When it comes to living in a new city, Davis is a decided fan of what California has to offer. \u201cThe weather is amazing. The city fits me,\u201d Davis told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s more slow motion, and that\u2019s kind of how I am. \u2026 I live out here in the summers. L.A. is one of my favorite cities. I love to live here. \u201d As for the talk of James leaving his number for Davis to take up next season, the former Pelicans star explained why No. 23 is special to him. \u201cBeing from Chicago, [Michael] Jordan had 23 and he was my favorite basketball player for a while,\u201d Davis told the newspaper. \u201cBut honestly, I was No. 3 and No. 30 before I was No. 23. When I got to high school as a freshman, upperclassmen already had No. 3 and 30 and they get first say, so they pulled a jersey out of a bag and threw me the jersey and said, \u2018This is the jersey you\u2019re going to wear,\u2019 and it just happened to be 23. \u201cObviously, Jordan wore it and me being younger, watching LeBron, that number just stuck with me. It was definitely exciting to know I had that number to follow Jordan and LeBron, who wore that number as well.\u201d Davis, 26, initially asked to be traded in late January , midway through his seventh season with the Pelicans. The six-time All-Star has averaged 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 466 career games as the Pelicans have reached the playoffs just twice during his tenure, with one series victory. He appeared in 56 games last sason, a career-low, and saw downturns in his overall shooting (51.7 percent) and 3-point shooting (33.1 percent). Following the Feb. 7 trade deadline, Davis never played more than 34 minutes in a game . With a new opportunity ahead in Los Angeles, Davis is aiming to atone for what was one of his worst seasons in the NBA. \u201cBeing limited to 20 to 25 minutes was definitely different. Not being able to play in the fourth quarter and close out games was a little hard for me,\u201d Davis told the newspaper. \u201cI wanted to go out there and help the team win. I just want to play again. I was limited last season and now I\u2019m looking forward to getting back on the floor and being productive next year. \u201cMy season was cut short, or at least limited in terms of playing the game that I love. I\u2019m excited to get back to it and get back into the swing of things. I started back working out, so that helps. I want to make this season better than the last.\u201d Los Angeles will also reportedly send Moritz Wagner, Issac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones and a future second-round pick to the Washington Wizards as part of the deal that will bring Davis to town. The move is being done to free up a maximum contract spot for the Lakers, who may have eyes on Toronto Raptors star Kawhi Leonard (among others). NBA free-agent news has dominated the sports world of late, but Davis said he\u2019s not paying attention to what happens. \u201cI don\u2019t really get into it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s for the media and the fans to capture. I just want to focus on basketball.\u201d Overall, no matter who he suits up next season with in Los Angeles, Davis already has his end result in mind. \u201cMy goal is to win a championship,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI expect to win every time I step on the court, every game. I want to win a title. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about \u2014 winning titles. That\u2019s the only thing on my mind.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":32925,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-dwyane-wade-2k20","date":"2019-07-01","title":"Anthony Davis, Dwyane Wade to cover NBA 2K20 video game","content":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Anthony Davis will be the cover athlete for the second time of a popular 2K Sports basketball video game.

Not a signature on a free agent contract \u2014 a meeting. The courtesy of a simple hello, a how-do-you-do and pull up a chair. The premier NBA franchise in the biggest city \u2013 the one with the sellout crowds nightly, the pretty people in the front row, the nightlife options galore and endorsement options aplenty \u2014 couldn\u2019t sway A-list players on the fringe benefits alone to consider spending the prime of their career with the Knicks. This is where the Knicks are in their existence, sitting at the intersection of irrelevant and invisible. They are so far away from being an NBA heavyweight and even further from their next championship, a dry spell of 46 seasons and counting . Maybe they finally reached rock bottom Sunday. If so, the good news is the concrete beneath their feet will likely show some compassion and won\u2019t become a sinkhole. On the first day of free agency, the Knicks lost out to Durant and Irving, two stars whom they chased for more than a year. That would be OK on the surface because, well, it\u2019s not as if this never happened to the Knicks before. But they lost out on both to the Nets. That\u2019s the team way over in Brooklyn, by way of East Rutherford and Piscataway and Long Island. The team that, just four short years ago, was in shambles and far worse off than the Knicks ever were (and maybe ever will be). The \u201cother\u201d New York team. Durant and Irving essentially said they could enjoy all the extras of being stars in New York without having to play for the Knicks. They therefore chose a Brooklyn team on the upswing, with a dynamic front office, an energetic young coach and a batch of scrappy supporting players who reflect the personality of the city\u2019s largest borough. It must be said there\u2019s no guarantee the Knicks blew it by failing to sign Irving (who went weird on the Celtics last season) and Durant (who just underwent Achilles surgery and won\u2019t even play until 2020-21 when he\u2019s 32). Durant, in fact, may never be the Goliath he was before the injury. It could be the Nets lost by winning, and this will be reflected in the near future if Irving\u2019s personality and leadership skills go flatter than his Earth-truther beliefs and Durant turns into Rudy Gay. But it sure feels like the Knicks just took another wallop to their culture and character. They spent the previous season in the tank and traded Kristaps Porzingis , their only real asset, to clear millions in salary-cap space to sign a pair of game-changers. They instead wound up with reported deals with Julius Randle, Bobby Portis and Taj Gibson . Three mid-tier power forwards weren\u2019t exactly what the Knicks had in mind when this all began. The immediate feedback was so severe that team president Steve Mills took the unprecedented step of issuing a statement to fans. In it, he sensed they were \u201cdisappointed,\u201d but assured them that the Knicks \u201ccompete for championships in the future.\u201d If nothing else, the Knicks constantly lead the league in trying again. But the Knicks, after so many bad seasons and backfired quick fixes, may soon be seen as a franchise beyond saving. The NBA\u2019s traditional franchises \u2014 the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers \u2013 have all suffered through tough stretches. Yet they all eventually rose back up and reclaimed lost glamour and respectability. The Knicks are always playing on the coveted Christmas Day time slot not because they earned it, but because of where they play. But being in New York doesn\u2019t save them the rest of the year. Nor does it do so in summertime, when the game\u2019s best free agents take the best available fit. Yet the Knicks don\u2019t even get a meeting. A meeting! It\u2019s been a painful fall, one that began soon after the Knicks\u2019 last Finals appearance in 1999 . Since then, the Knicks have five overall playoff berths, one playoff series win and haven\u2019t been to the playoffs since 2013. They\u2019ve had five different coaches in the last six seasons and are only starting to dig out from under the dreadful Phil Jackson regime. The last home-grown Draft pick to become an All-Star since Porzingis in 2018 was David Lee in 2010 . Before that, it was Patrick Ewing. The current team brings no guarantee of stardom and the Knicks are left to hope a keeper emerges from Randle, top draft pick RJ Barrett, Dennis Smith Jr. and Kevin Knox, all of whom are under 24 years old or younger. But the Knicks expected far more than this, given the last few years of losing and pleading for patience. And it\u2019s hard not to see how they failed when comparing them to the Nets. Brooklyn seemed broken after the Celtics stole their future win the Paul Pierce\/Kevin Garnett trade in the summer of 2013 . But they had the smarts to put the right people in place and come up with a plan. There are no mountains in Brooklyn because GM Sean Marks moved them to revamp the club, using out-of-the-box thinking and educated chances on unwanted players. That led to a 42-win season in 2018-19 and an unexpected playoff berth . Without any draft picks, Marks used the Nets\u2019 ample cap space as a dumping ground for bad contracts from other teams \u2014 if they came packaged with picks. Or he got a future All-Star in a deal, as in D\u2019Angelo Russell (whom the Lakers dealt away in 2017 ). How bright are things in Brooklyn right now? The Nets essentially released Russell to reach a deal with Irving, who\u2019s an upgrade, and Durant. They have solid pieces, all secured through smart decision-making, in Caris LeVert, Joe Harris, Jarrett Allen and Spencer Dinwiddie. And they no longer owe the Celtics more future Draft picks. Had the Knicks done the same over the last three seasons or so, Durant and Irving might be Knicks today. It had to be gut-wrenching for the Knicks to hear Andre Iguodala say \u201cnobody\u2019s going to the Knicks\u201d days ago. That non-endorsement speaks volumes about the way some great players feel about the Knicks, at least those with options. And the truth is, LeBron came on the market twice, as did Durant and Kyrie \u2026 and they went elsewhere. In the case of Kyrie and Durant going to Brooklyn, they added additional insult. This isn\u2019t entirely the fault of Scott Perry and David Fizdale, the GM and coach, respectively, who\u2019ve only been on the job for a few years. This is more about the culture created by past failures and a stigma that slowly grew from that which now threatens to swallow the franchise. All the Knicks can do is \u2026 do better. Draft better, trade better and take better chances on players who are diamonds in the rough. Maybe next time the Knicks will not only get a meeting, but a signed contract from someone who believes the team in Manhattan is the best place to be. That might take a few years, but what\u2019s that to a team that has spent the last four decades \u2026 waiting to win big? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

After Shams Charania of The Athletic initially reported the deal was close to being agreed upon, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski confirmed the sign-and-trade transaction had been approved by both teams. Wojnarowski adds that, in order to free up the requisite cap space for Russell, the Warriors have agreed to trade Andre Iguodala to the Memphis Grizzlies along with a protected future first-round pick. Read More \u2026 \u2014 5:26 a.m. The Miami Heat were not thought to be big players in free agency this summer, but that changed when everything opened on Sunday night. Per multiple reports, the Heat are trying to put the finishing touches on a sign-and-trade deal with the Philadelphia 76ers that will land them guard Jimmy Butler. The swingman has reportedly agreed to a four-year, $142 million deal , but Miami and Philadelphia were still working out some aspects of the swap, such as the addition of Dallas as the third team. The Heat are reportedly sending Josh Richardson to Philadelphia as part of the deal and, at one point, guard Goran Dragic was on the move to Dallas in the trade. However, the status of the deal seems to be held up as of early Monday morning. Read more \u2026 \u2014 4:51 a.m. In agreeing to reported  deals with Bogdan Bogdanovic and Ed Davis in the opening hours of Sunday\u2019s frenzy, the Utah Jazz have moved in a different direction with some of their frontcourt for 2019-20.  That means Derrick Favors, who has been with the Jazz since 2011, is on his way out of town and headed a little closer to his home state of Georgia. Per multiple reports, the New Orleans Pelicans are set to acquire Favors via a trade. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Pelicans are sending 2012 and 2023 picks \u2014 which are both from the Golden State Warriors \u2014 to the Jazz as part of the deal. \u2014 4:28 a.m. The Sacramento Kings are trying to keep pace in the Western Conference roster-building race this offseason. They started out by getting Harrison Barnes to agree to a new deal and adding spring center Dewayne Dedmon as well, too. Attention has reportedly shifted to the backcourt as the Kings and veteran point guard Cory Joseph have agreed to a three-year, $37 million deal, reports Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. Joseph spent the last two seasons with the Indiana Pacers, and before that logged two seasons with the Toronto Raptors after spending his first four NBA seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. Overall, he has career averages of 6.9 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 528 career games. \u2014 3:20 a.m. Reggie Bullock becomes the latest reported addition for the Knicks, who continue to add role players after missing out on superstar talent. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that Bullock will sign with New York for two years and $21 million. The 28-year-old swingman played 63 total games with the Lakers and Pistons last season, averaging 11.3 points while shooting 37.7 percent from 3-point range. \u2014 2:19 a.m. Patrick Beverley has made a career out of scrapping for everything he earns. It paid off early Monday morning when he confirmed reports of his return to the Clippers for a three-year, $40 million contract. Beverley served as a veteran leader and defensive pest for the Clippers, who defied expectations en route to 48 wins and taking the Warriors to six games in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. The former second-round pick averaged 7.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists last season, his seventh in the NBA and second with LA. \u2014 1:29 a.m. After coming within a game of the Western Conference finals, Denver is reportedly ensuring its young core remains intact. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that the Nuggets have come to terms on a five-year, $170 million extension for Jamal Murray . The seventh overall pick in the 2016 Draft, Murray averaged career-highs in points (18.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (4.8) per game last season. Murray (22) joins Nikola Jokic (24) and Gary Harris (24) as young, key players that Denver has under contract for the foreseeable future. The Nuggets extended the Portland Trail Blazers to Game 7 in the Western Conference semifinals, the end of the franchise\u2019s first postseason appearance since 2013. \u2014 12:44 a.m. The Knicks continue to gather frontcout help, this time from Washington. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that New York and Bobby Portis have come to terms on a two-year, $31 million offer sheet. Because he is a restricted free agent, Portis could remain with the Wizards if they decide to match the Knicks\u2019 offer. Fred Katz of The Athletic, however, reports that Washington has no plans to do so. In 50 total games divided between the Bulls and Wizards last season, Portis averaged 14.2 points and 8.1 rebounds while shooting a career-high 39.3 percent from 3-point range. \u2014 12:19 a.m. One Lopez brother worked out so well, the Bucks apparently figured getting the other one would be even better. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports that Milwaukee has come to terms with free agent center Robin Lopez. The veteran big man brings an added dose of rebounding and interior defense to the Bucks, who came within two games of the NBA Finals last season. The 31-year-old Lopez averaged 9.5 points, 3.9 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in his third season with Chicago. \u2014 1 1:40 p.m. Not many thought Klay Thompson would leave the Warriors, and that appears to be the case. Klay Thompson has agreed to sign a five-year, $190 million contract to remain in Golden State, per multiple reports. Thompson sustained a torn ACL in his left knee during Game 6 of The Finals and is in the midst of a lengthy recovery process. Thompson has had seven straight seasons with at least 200 3-pointers, tied with Stephen Curry for the most in NBA history. He has eight straight seasons of shooting at least 40 percent from beyond the arc, which is the league\u2019s second-longest active streak in the NBA behind Curry. His 1,798 career 3s are 16th all time. Thompson, the 11th overall pick in the 2011 Draft, is a five-time All-Star and two-time third-team All-NBA player averaging 19.5 points and 42 percent 3-point shooting in his career. \u2014 11:06 p.m. Reserve big man Mike Muscala has reportedly agreed to sign with Oklahoma City, per Adrian Wojnarowski . The 6-foot-11 veteran averaged 7.0 points and 3.8 rebounds last season in 64 total games for the Lakers and 76ers. \u2014 11:04 p.m. The Blazers will reportedly take a two-year, minimum flyer on Mario Hezonja, per Adrian Wojnarowski . The former fifth overall pick averaged 8.8 points and 4.1 rebounds for the Knicks last season. \u2014 10:57 p.m. Houston will reportedly re-sign Gerald Green and Danuel House, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The duo accounted for four made 3-pointers per game for the Rockets last season. \u2014 10:51 p.m. After financially committing to Bojan Bogdanovic \u2014 and letting Derrick Favors go as a result \u2014 Utah has reportedly refortified its frontcourt by signing free agent big man Ed Davis. Adrian Wojnarowski adds that the deal is for two years and $10 million. A nine-year veteran, Davis averaged 5.8 points and 8.6 rebounds in just 17.9 minutes per game for the Nets last season. The former lottery pick joins a rebuilt Jazz roster that will also include Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. \u2014 10:42 p.m. Nerlens Noel, drafted No. 6 by the Philadelphia 76ers as part of their vaunted \u201cProcess\u201d in 2013, has been traded twice since. But he settled into a bench role with the Oklahoma City Thunder last season, playing a career-high 77 games while averaging 4.9 points and 1.2 blocks in 13.5 minutes. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski initially reported that Noel has agreed to return and help the Thunder attempt to advance beyond the first round in a wide-open Western Conference. Later, however, Wojnarowski reported that Noel has since asked Oklahoma City for time to reconsider that commitment, and that both sides are continuing discussions. \u2014 10:35 p.m. The Bulls\u2019 rebuild will be supplemented by veteran presence in the form of Thaddeus Young. According to multiple reports, Young has reportedly agreed to a three-year, $41 million contract with the Bulls. Young averaged 12.6 points and 6.5 rebounds while shooting 34.9 percent from 3 last season for the Pacers. The 31-year-old forward has put up double-figure scoring numbers in every season since 2008. \u2014 10:26 p.m. The Nets\u2019 rebuild is reportedly set. After years of operating without their own draft picks and scrounging for undervalued talent from other teams, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Brooklyn is on the verge of adding former All-NBA center DeAndre Jordan along with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency. In order to make such a union possible, Durant and Irving will reportedly accept less than maximum-salary deals to allow Jordan to sign for four years and $40 million. After playing with the Clippers for 10 seasons, Jordan was traded to the Knicks in January as New York sought to carve out max cap space for this summer\u2019s free agent shopping spree. Instead it appears Brooklyn is the New York destination chosen by Durant, Irving and now Jordan, who has averaged at least 10 points and 13 rebounds over the last six seasons. The free agent trio joins a roster that still includes Caris LeVert, 2019 3-Point Contest winner Joe Harris, athletic big man Jarrett Allen and sixth man point guard Spencer Dinwiddie. \u2014 10:03 p.m. Brooklyn native Taj Gibson is reportedly set to sign with the New York Knicks, per Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. The deal is detailed to be for two years and $20 million. The 34-year-old power forward averaged 10.8 points and 6.5 rebounds for the Timberwolves last season. \u2014 9:43 p.m. Al Horford was a prime free agent catch for the Boston Celtics three seasons ago, marking the beginning of their ascent toward Eastern Conference contention. After a surprisingly turbulent season that ended in a five-game \u201cgentleman\u2019s sweep\u201d at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Horford will reportedly be attempting to boost a division rival over the top. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Horford has agreed to a four-year, $109 million deal with the Philadelphia 76ers. Read More \u2026 \u2014 9:19 p.m. On a landmark day of big-name signings, the Nets aren\u2019t forgetting the importance of role players. Marc Spears of ESPN reports that Garrett Temple is expected to sign a two-year, $10 million contract with Brooklyn. The 33-year-old swingman is a career 35.3-percent shooter from 3, a skill set that should help alongside Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan. \u2014 9:03 p.m. Relentless energy and interior efficiency have reportedly earned Thomas Bryant a permanent place in the NBA. According to multiple reports, the Wizards have agreed to terms that will keep Bryant on a three-year, $25 million contract. The former second-round pick averaged 10.5 points and 6.3 rebounds in just 20.8 minutes per game for Washington, which ultimately made him their starting center. The 21-year-old big man was originally drafted 42nd overall by the Jazz in 2017. \u2014 8:48 p.m. The Spurs\u2019 rock-solid reputation will welcome an equally respected swingman in DeMarre Carroll, per Shams Charania of The Athletic. The veteran forward has reportedly agreed to a two-year, $13 million contract with the Spurs. Last season the 32-year-old veteran averaged 11.1 points and 5.2 rebounds for the Nets, who made their first postseason appearance since 2015. \u2014 8:38 p.m. After agreeing to trade Malcolm Brogdon to the Pacers, Milwaukee will reportedly re-sign George Hill to keep at least some of its backcourt depth. Shams Charania of The Athletic tweeted that Hill has agreed to a three-year, $29 million contract. After being traded from Cleveland mid-season and struggling through injury, Hill came to life in Milwaukee\u2019s run to the Eastern Conference finals, averaging 11.5 points while shooting 41.7 percent from 3. The 33-year-old combo guard provides a needed and steady hand at point guard in the wake of Brogdon\u2019s departure, and should serve as the primary backup to starting playmaker Eric Bledsoe. \u2014 8:28 p.m. Last season, the Portland Trail Blazers finally cracked the playoff code and made a run all the way to the Western Conference finals. And Rodney Hood played a key role off the bench, crucially hitting what proved to be a game-winning 3-pointer in quadruple-overtime of Game 3 against the Denver Nuggets in the conference semis, along with a 25-point showing in Game 6 of that same series. Now, he\u2019s reportedly ready to run it back, with ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reporting that Hood will return to Portland on a two-year, $16 million deal. After being drafted in 2014, Hood had been developing steadily with the Utah Jazz before an ill-fated trade to the Cavaliers stunted that growth. After struggling with Cleveland, a deadline deal to the Blazers created an opportunity for efficiency in a clear-cut role. He averaged 9.6 points on 45.2 shooting, which would have represented a career-best mark from the floor. \u2014 8:14 p.m. After reportedly waffling over offering Kevin Durant a fully guaranteed contract, the New York Knicks decided Julius Randle was next best and available priority. Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report that Randle and the Knicks had come to terms on a three-year, $63 million contract. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports added that the third year of that contract is a team option. The seventh overall pick of the 2014 Draft, Randle averaged a career-high 21.4 points and 8.7 rebounds in his lone season with New Orleans after leaving the Lakers via free agency just a year ago. With No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson set to begin a new era for the Pelicans, Randle has seemingly decided to move on to a team in desperate need of talent. For New York, the move signals a fall-back plan after failing to land any All-Star talent with ample cap space available. Instead, the Knicks will move forward with Randle and third overall pick RJ Barrett. \u2014 8:03 p.m. The last time Kemba Walker was playing for a team in New England, he delivered a championship. Boston fans can only hope that repeats itself. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Walker has agreed to sign a four-year maximum contract with the Celtics. A source told the Associated Press on Sunday that it\u2019s likely that Walker will be part of a trade that would send Terry Rozier from Boston to Charlotte on a three-year, $58 million deal. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the moves have not been finalized. The Charlotte Observer first reported that Walker had informed the Hornets of his decision . Read more \u2026 \u2014 8:01 p.m. Orlando continues to retain the core of its roster, reportedly coming to terms with Terrence Ross on a day they also came to reported agreements with Nikola Vucevic and former Blazers forward Al-Farouq Aminu. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported the Ross deal as a four-year, $54 million contract. The 6-foot-7 swingman is coming off a career year in which he averaged 15.1 points while shooting 38.3 percent from 3. \u2014 7:52 p.m. The Indiana Pacers have quickly revamped a team that surprisingly made the playoffs despite the mid-season loss of All-Star guard Victor Oladipo. Reports are they\u2019ve bolstered the backcourt by agreeing to a 3-year, $31.5 million deal with Jeremy Lamb , per Shams Charania of The Athletic. Lamb, a 6-foot-5 guard, has spent the last four seasons with Charlotte after being drafted by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Last season, Lamb built on a breakthrough 2017-18 campaign for the Hornets, setting career highs in minutes (28.5), points (15.3) and rebounds (5.5), while shooting 34.8 percent from 3-point range and 44.0 percent overall. His 4.2 attempts from deep also represented a high. \u2014 7:46 p.m. Looking to build on a playoff breakthrough, the Magic have reportedly added veteran forward Al-Farouq Aminu, per Adrian Wojnarowski. Entering his 10th year out of Wake Forest, Aminu started for the Blazers throughout their run to the Western Conference finals last season, averaging 9.4 points and 7.5 rebounds in 28.3 minutes while shooting 34.3 percent from 3-point range and 43.3 percent overall. \u2014 7:44 p.m. Veteran swingman Trevor Ariza is reportedly set to move from Washington D.C. to Sacramento. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that the veteran swingman will join the Kings on a two-year, $25 million contract. The 34-year-old forward averaged 14.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 43 games with the Wizards after being traded from Phoenix in the middle of last season. \u2014 7:36 p.m. Philadelphia isn\u2019t eager to re-start the Process. According to multiple reports, the 76ers will bring back Tobias Harris on a five-year $180 million deal. The Sixers acquired Harris from the LA Clippers in exchange for Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two future first-round picks and two future second-round picks. Between Harris\u2019 talent, the price to obtain him, and the risk of losing him for nothing, it appears Philadelphia had no intention of letting Harris walk away for nothing in unrestricted free agency. Harris averaged 18.2 points and 7.9 rebounds in 27 games with the 76ers. A former first-round pick of the then-Charlotte Bobcats in 2011, Harris has played for the Bucks, Magic, Pistons, Clippers and 76ers. \u2014 7:25 p.m. The buzz started to build around the Utah Jazz earlier Sunday, and as soon as meetings began to be announced, reports indicated that it was for good reason: ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski relayed that the Utah Jazz have agreed to a four-year, $73 million deal with swingman Bojan Bogdanovic. The 6-foot-8 Croatian, originally drafted by the Brooklyn Nets \u2013 in 2011, two years ahead of his NBA arrival \u2013 spent the last two seasons with the Indiana Pacers. When Victor Oladipo went down with a knee injury in January, Bogdanovic took over as the primary option for Indiana, while continuing to provide solid defense on the other end. He finished the year averaging 18.0 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.0 assists while shooting 42.5 percent from 3-point range and 49.7 percent overall. Bogdanovic joins an up-and-coming Jazz team that includes Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles and (once Utah\u2019s reported trade with Memphis is complete) Mike Conley. \u2014 7:06 p.m. After moving heaven and earth to acquire him, the Dallas Mavericks weren\u2019t about to let Kristaps Porzingis go anywhere. Multiple reports, including from Marc Stein of The New York Times , state Porzingis has agreed to a five-year, $158 million contract to remain with Dallas . Porzingis missed all of last season while recovering from a torn ACL suffered in 2017-18. Still just 23 years old, the 7-foot-3 big man will pair his multi-dimensional skillset with reigning Kia Rookie of the Year Luka Doncic as the Mavericks transition from the Dirk Nowitzki era. Porzingis boasts career averages of 17.8 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.0 blocks while shooting 36.1 percent from 3-point range. \u2014 6:59 p.m. With Darren Collison retired and Ricky Rubio reportedly heading to Phoenix, the Pacers will shift gears to a younger option at point guard. Multiple reports, including from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, have Milwaukee signing and trading 26-year-old combo guard Malcolm Brogdon to the Pacers in exchange for a future first-round pick and two second-round picks. Brogdon shattered any expectations set for him as a former second-round pick, winning 2016-17 Kia Rookie of the Year honors while becoming an essential part of Milwaukee\u2019s backcourt rotation. Brogdon averaged 13.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists during the 2019 NBA playoffs as the Bucks reached the Eastern Conference finals. \u2014 6:48 p.m. The Phoenix Suns got a point guard after all. Multiple reports, including from Shams Charania , state that Ricky Rubio will leave Utah for the rebuilding Suns, who have not had a steady hand at point guard since trading Eric Bledsoe to Milwaukee in 2017. Now Phoenix adds a veteran, pass-first playmaker alongside young talents Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges. The 28-year-old Rubio averaged 12.7 points, 6.1 assists and 1.3 steals for the Jazz last season. \u2014 6:38 p.m. Philadelphia\u2019s best outside shooter will ply his trade alongside newly minted No. 1 pick Zion Williamson. Multiple reports, including from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, have JJ Redick joining New Orleans on a two-year deal worth over $26 million. The 35-year-old shooting guard averaged a career-high 18.1 points while shooting 39.7 percent from 3 for the 76ers last season. Redick adds a dose of much-needed perimeter marksmanship and veteran presence to the rebuilding Pelicans, who will also boast Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram once they finalize a trade to send Anthony Davis to the Lakers. \u2014 6:30 p.m. After a resurgent season with the Timberwolves, former Kia MVP Derrick Rose has agreed to sign a two-year contract with Detroit, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Rose averaged 18.0 points on 48.2 percent shooting, including a career-best 37.0 percent from 3 last season. The former No. 1 overall pick has not played 70 games or more in a regular season since 2010-11, but showed enough staying power with the Timberwolves to garner interest this offseason. \u2014 6:19 p.m. Memphis has designs on reshaping its roster behind its new rookie, Ja Morant, and second-year big man Jaren Jackson Jr. However, the Grizzlies have some other key youngsters that could prove crucial to the future, including center Jonas Valanciunas. Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the Grizzlies have agreed to re-sign Valanciunas to a three-year, $45 million deal . After missing two months before the trade to recover from thumb surgery, Valanciunas was dominant from his debut with Memphis after it acquired him at the trade deadline. From the trade deadline through the end of the regular season, he was the only NBA player to average at least 19 points (19.9), 10 rebounds (10.7) and 1.5 blocks (1.58) on 50 percent shooting (54.5%). \u2014 6:17 p.m. Kevin Durant is on the move once again. The two-time Finals MVP announced via The Boardroom that he intends to sign with the Brooklyn Nets. The Golden State Warriors\u2019 standout forward will reportedly sign a four-year, $164 million deal with Brooklyn and is expected to team with former Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving and former All-NBA big man DeAndre Jordan. News had already broken that Irving and the Nets were moving toward a max deal that would pay the All-Star guard $141 million over four seasons. The two All-NBA talents join a Nets roster that already includes Caris LeVert, Joe Harris, Jarrett Allen and Spencer Dinwiddie. Read more \u2026 \u2014 6:12 p.m. Khris Middleton\u2019s first All-Star appearance and key role on an Eastern Conference finals run was enough to convince Milwaukee to bring him back at all costs. Multiple reports, including Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, state that Middleton will return to the Bucks on a five-year, $178 million deal. Middleton averaged 18.3 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.3 assists for a Bucks team that earned the league\u2019s best record (60-22) in 2018-19. The former second-round pick was an unrestricted free agent and in high demand in a robust free agent market. Milwaukee, however, appears set on maintaining as much of its contending core as possible. \u2014 6:08 p.m. Charlotte will lose Kemba Walker, but reportedly not for nothing. Multiple reports, including Shams Charania of The Athletic, Terry Rozier will wind up with the Hornets via sign-and-trade with a three-year, $58 million contract. Rozier became a prime free agent candidate once his All-Star peers at point guard had already chosen their destinations. The Hornets would appear to have jumped to the front of the line with a good-sized contract. The news comes despite Rozier coming off a disappointing season in which he averaged just 9.0 points per game on 38.7 percent shooting. The Hornets are no doubt banking on Rozier recapturing his 2017-18 form, which saw him step in for an injured Kyrie Irving and average 16.5 points during the Celtics\u2019 Eastern Conference finals run. \u2014 5:57 p.m. Rudy Gay\u2019s bounce-back season in San Antonio was enough to convince the Spurs to bring him back. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that Gay will re-sign with the Spurs for two years, $32 million. Gay averaged 13.7 points and 6.8 rebounds while shooting a career-high 40.2 percent from 3 in his second season with San Antonio. \u2014 5:45 p.m. Per The Athletic\u2019s Sam Amick, the Kings will re-sign Harrison Barnes (four years, $85 million) while adding Dewayne Dedmon (three years, $40 million). Barnes averaged 14.3 points in 28 games with the Kings after his trade from the Dallas Mavericks, while Dedmon averaged 10.8 points and 7.5 rebounds with the Hawks. \u2014 5:25 p.m. The Milwaukee Bucks climbed to the top of the Eastern Conference standings in the 2018-19 regular season. Much of that was due to an offense that thrived on 3-pointers, including a barrage of them from center Brook Lopez. The man dubbed \u201cSplash Mountain\u201d by Bucks faithful will apparently be back in the mix for a few more seasons with Milwaukee. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Lopez will sign a four-year, $52 million deal once free agency opens tonight. The news was also confirmed by Matt Velasquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . The 11-year veteran had a standout year with Milwaukee, averaging 12.5 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game. Perhaps his greatest value was as a 3-point shooter, where he connected on 36.5% and sank a career-best 187 3-pointers. \u2014 4:36 p.m. It wouldn\u2019t be an NBA trade deadline without a wild trade possibly being bandied about, and this one is no different. Per Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Boston Celtics are showing interest and having talks about a potential three-team trade that would involve the Brooklyn Nets, Charlotte Hornets and themselves. In it, a trio of point guards \u2014 Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker and Terry Rozier \u2014 would shift locales. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski , via Twitter: \u2014 3:15 p.m.  The New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 offseason roster renovation began with the reported trade of All-Star big man Anthony Davis. Then, it entered its next phase with the drafting of Zion Williamson with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 draft. It is apparently continuing as the Pelicans are close to finalizing a two-year deal with EuroLeague star Nicolo Melli, reports ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski via Twitter : Andrew Lopez of The Times-Picayune  also confirmed the move . Last season, Melli averaged 7.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game during the season, but upped those marks to 8 ppg and 4.5 rpg in the EuroLeague Final Four. \u2014 12:31 p.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * *"},{"id":32919,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-al-horford-agrees-contract-sixers","date":"2019-07-01","title":"Reports: Al Horford leaving Celtics, agrees with Sixers","content":"Al Horford was a prime free agent catch for the Boston Celtics three seasons ago, marking the beginning of their ascent toward Eastern Conference contention. After a surprisingly turbulent season that ended in a five-game \u201cgentleman\u2019s sweep\u201d at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Horford will reportedly be attempting to boost a division rival over the top. As first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Horford has agreed to a four-year, $109 million deal with the Philadelphia 76ers . The deal includes $97 million in guarantees and $12 million in bonuses tied to championships, Wojnarowski reports. The Celtics, per ESPN, were willing to offer Horford a four-year deal, but he opted for more money. His was one of at least 11 deals worth at least $100 million agreed to on Sunday, one of the wildest spending days in league history. Last season, the 33-year-old Horford averaged 13.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.3 blocks, shooting 53.5 percent from the field and 36.0 percent from deep \u2014 right in line with his career averages even as he played a career-low 29.0 minutes per game. The 12-year veteran again made the playoffs, maintaining a perfect record of reaching the postseason to cap each campaign he\u2019s played in the league. A versatile big, the 6-foot-10 Horford can easily slot at either the 4 or 5, adept at playing in multiple offensive styles as need be. In Philadelphia, he\u2019d slot alongside All-NBA center Joel Embiid \u2014 who stands 7-foot \u2014 and Tobias Harris (6-foot-9) in a towering front line that should present matchup problems and difficult decisions for opposing defenses.

Boston fans can only hope that repeats itself. Per multiple reports , Walker has agreed to sign a four-year maximum contract with the Celtics. A source told the Associated Press on Sunday that it\u2019s likely that Walker will be part of a trade that would send Terry Rozier from Boston to Charlotte on a three-year, $58 million deal. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the moves have not been finalized. The Charlotte Observer first reported that Walker had informed the Hornets of his decision . Walker, who led UConn to an NCAA title eight years ago, could have earned up to a so-called supermax total of $221 million over five years. He triggered the potential offer after being recognized with All-NBA Third Team honors at the end of the season, following his third All-Star appearance and a career-best average of 25.6 points per game (43.4 FG%; 35.6 3P%), along with 4.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.2 steals in 34.9 minutes. Earlier this month, Walker said he would be willing to take less than the supermax figure to help Charlotte build a roster and said his \u201cfirst priority\u201d in free agency would be the Hornets. But amid reports that said the Hornets\u2019 offer didn\u2019t even reach $170 million, Walker clearly turned his attention elsewhere \u2014 as he said he would. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019ll sign back with them. \u2026 If it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019m definitely prepared to play somewhere else,\u201d Walker said earlier this month. Boston turned out to be that somewhere else. It\u2019s a natural fit on multiple levels. The Celtics have been bracing to lose All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, and now have a three-time All-Star in Walker to slide into the starting spot. And Walker played his college basketball in Storrs, Connecticut, less than 90 miles from Boston and is still revered after leading the Huskies to the 2011 NCAA title. UConn beat Butler \u2014 coached by now-Celtics coach Brad Stevens \u2014 in that championship game. Walker\u2019s departure will be a major blow for the Hornets, who \u2013 barring a late sign-and-trade, which does not seem likely \u2014 will lose their franchise player for nothing. Walker\u2019s departure comes a few weeks after backup point guard Tony Parker, the longtime San Antonio standout who played with Charlotte last season, announced his retirement from the NBA.

His decision was announced Sunday at the start of the NBA free agency period on the Instagram page for The Boardroom, an online series looking at sports business produced by Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman. Durant won titles with Golden State in 2017 and \u201918 then was injured for much of the postseason this year as the team lost the NBA Finals in six games to the Toronto Raptors. A ruptured right Achilles tendon could keep him out the entire next season, and whenever he returns it will be in the Brooklyn black. And he\u2019ll be joined by Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan, his 2016 U.S. Olympic teammates who also agreed to deals with the Nets on Sunday. ESPN first reported Durant\u2019s decision, saying he had agreed to a four-year deal worth $164 million. Durant could have gotten five years and about $221 million to remain with the Warriors. Durant, a 10-time All-Star who just completed his 12th NBA season, was leading all postseason scorers at 34.2 points per game when he strained his right calf on May 8 in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Rockets. He had seven 30-point performances during the recent playoffs. It\u2019s unclear how he will play whenever he can return, but the Nets were willing to take a chance with a team on the rise. Brooklyn finished 42-40 this season and lost in the first round of the playoffs, then got a huge victory Sunday when it beat out the Warriors, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers for Durant. Durant, who grew up in the Washington area and spent one college season at Texas, played his first year with the Seattle SuperSonics before they departed for Oklahoma City, where Durant played eight seasons with the Thunder before joining the Warriors in 2016. He was heavily criticized for that move, seen as taking an easy route by joining a team that had just won an NBA-record 73 games. But it worked out for Durant and the Warriors, as he was the NBA Finals MVP in their championships in both 2017 and 2018. This season was filled with talk of his future \u2014 sometimes to Durant\u2019s annoyance \u2014 though for much of the season it was focused on the Knicks if he decided to leave. But the Nets became a more attractive option with young talent that should help them be competitive next season even while Durant recovers. The Warriors will have to move on without Durant, who had three games with 45 or more points in the postseason before getting hurt. They still have Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and were expected to re-sign Klay Thompson, though he will miss much or all of next season after tearing an ACL in the NBA Finals. The bigger disappointment may be for the Knicks, who had cleared enough money to sign two maximum salary free agents when they traded Kristaps Porzingis during the season. The hope was that Durant would be one of them, but instead he will end up a few miles across the river with a team that could be poised to be the dominant team in the city for years. * * * AP Sports Writer Janie McCauley in Oakland, California, contributed to this report."},{"id":32976,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-nikola-vucevic-re-sign-magic","date":"2019-07-01","title":"Report: Nikola Vucevic agrees to max deal with Magic","content":" Orlando Magic big man Nikola Vucevic has agreed to stay with the team he\u2019s known most of his career. Vucevic has agreed to a four-year, $100 million deal to stay with the Magic, Vucevic\u2019s agent, Bill Duffy, told ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks . Vucevic was the key piece in Orlando\u2019s summer as the Magic have nine free agents in total. He was an All-Star in 2018-19, putting up career-bests in points (20.8), rebounds (12.0) and assists (3.8) per game. Aside from a rookie season spent with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2011-12, Vucevic has been with the Magic ever since, arriving in the Dwight Howard blockbuster trade in 2012 . Vucevic suffered through six seasons of struggles and rebuilding as the Magic endured five 50-loss seasons, four coaching changes and a front-office switch two seasons ago. However, Orlando went 22-9 down the stretch last season \u2014 the NBA\u2019s third-best record after Jan. 31 \u2014 and Vucevic was a big part of that surge toward the playoffs by being a key cog in the offense and an improved defender. Despite a solid regular season, Vucevic struggled in the playoffs (which was Orlando\u2019s first postseason appearance since 2012). In five playoff games, Vucevic tallied just 11.2 points a game while hitting only 36.2 percent of his shots and 23.1 percent from 3-point range. He had just one double-double (22 points and 14 rebounds in a Game 3 loss) and he closed the series with a foul-plagued six-point, seven-rebound effort in Game 5 when the Magic were eliminated. \u201cI\u2019ll have to re-watch the games, study them and really see, but right now I feel like in certain moments, I was overthinking stuff a little bit,\u201d Vucevic said at season\u2019s end. \u201cThe help and the double teams that they were throwing at me, it was a little different than I had seen before, and I was rushing a little bit. I just never established a rhythm to play. They threw me off my game a little bit and I never was able to figure it out the way that I wanted to. At the same time, it was the first time I was in that position and I think it will be great experience for me to learn from. The next time I\u2019m in that situation, I\u2019ll do better.\u201d In a pure numbers sense, Vucevic is one of the top players in Magic history , ranking second in rebounding, fifth in scoring, fourth in blocks, ninth in assists and seventh in steals. Orlando\u2019s front office was a big fan of bringing him back for another contract, Magic president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman said at season\u2019s end. \u201cBringing Vooch back is a priority, but with that being said Vooch is going to have a lot of teams that will make him a priority for them, too,\u201d Weltman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet with his representatives at the appropriate time. \u2026 Hopefully we can get something done.

The team is apparently on the cusp of doing what it can to make those words come true. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Blazers and Lillard were working toward agreement on a supermax deal that will pay Lillard $196 million over four seasons. Lillard is currently under contract through the 2020-21 season after he signed a five-year contract extension in 2015. ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst reports Lillard and the team have agreed to the deal , which will include a player option for $54.3 million in its final year. In the 2018-19 season, Lillard spearheaded the Blazers\u2019 run to the Western Conference finals , the team\u2019s first appearance in that playoff round since 2000. Portland was swept by the Golden State Warriors in that series, but not even that could undermine his standout season with the Blazers. Lillard was named All-NBA Second Team, marking the fourth straight season he has made an All-NBA team. He joins Clyde Drexler as the only Portland players to be named to an All-NBA team four times. Lillard is the seventh Trail Blazer to be named All-NBA, joining Bill Walton, Maurice Lucas, Jim Paxson, Drexler, Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge. Overall, Lillard averaged 25.8 points (44.4% FG, 36.9% 3-PT, 91.2% FT), 4.6 rebounds, a career-high 6.9 assists, 1.1 steals and 35.5 minutes in 80 games (all starts) for the Trail Blazers. Portland went 53-29 and finished with the third seed in the Western Conference. He finished the year ranked ninth in the NBA in points per game, tied for 11th in assists per game, third in free throw percentage, sixth in minutes per game, fourth in free throws made and sixth in three-pointers made. The team\u2019s on-court leader, Lillard earned his fourth All-Star nod during the regular season. He averaged 33 points in the opening round against the Thunder, but his production fell against the Denver Nuggets in the West semis and the Warriors in the West finals when he was double-teamed. Lillard said the past few seasons of relative stability \u2014 after four of Portland\u2019s five starters moved on to other teams in 2015 \u2014 have bonded the team. \u201cEach year we\u2019ve come back with the right attitude,\u201d Lillard said after the season ended. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to stick together through a lot of adversity and I think just what we\u2019ve hung our hats on, what we\u2019ve believed in, our culture, the togetherness, we\u2019ve been able to truly build on that.

Rubio, who was the Utah Jazz\u2019s starter the last two seasons, is on the open market after the Jazz reportedly pulled off a trade for Memphis Grizzlies guard Mike Conley on June 19. The Indiana Pacers were point guard shopping this summer, what with Darren Collison and Cory Joseph \u2014 their top two point guards from last season \u2014 being free agents. The news of Collison\u2019s retirement from the NBA on Saturday may have sped up Indiana\u2019s need to fill that spot and it appears Rubio will be the man for the job.

Here\u2019s more from Stein via Twitter : An eight-year NBA veteran, Rubio averaged 12.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.3 steals in 68 games with Utah last season. Overall, he has averaged 11.1 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 7.7 apg and 1.1 spg in his NBA career. \u2014 12:19 p.m. Dallas Mavericks big man Dwight Powell has steadily grown into a capable rotation player in his 4 1\/2 seasons with the team. A free agent this summer, Powell is reportedly not straying from the team he has developed the most with. Per Marc Stein of The New York Times and Tim MacMahon of ESPN , Powell will receive a contract extension from the Mavericks on Sunday night. Here\u2019s more from Stein , via Twitter: Last season, Powell averaged 10.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game in 77 games for Dallas. \u2014 11:19 a.m. The Brooklyn Nets are trying to secure a point guard of the future and perhaps more once free agency opens, it seems. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , the Nets are moving toward a max deal that would pay the All-Star Irving $141 million over four seasons. Not only that, but adding Irving is part of a two-fold plan to by the Nets to also attempt to secure All-NBA forward and former Finals MVP Kevin Durant, Wojnarowski reports. Per Wojnarowski, Durant is interested in the Nets and is expected to speak with them this week. Wojnarowski isn\u2019t the only one reporting a seeming Irving-Nets bond on the horizon as Greg Logan of Newsday also reports multiple NBA sources are calling Irving\u2019s move to Brooklyn a \u201cvirtual certainty\u201d . Logan also reports the Nets are planning to talk with Durant, too. Read more \u2026 \u2014 8:01 a.m. News dropped yesterday that Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are reportedly interested in teaming up for next season. Durant has reportedly said he\u2019ll consider four teams : the New York Knicks, LA Clippers, Golden State Warriors and Brooklyn Nets. Leonard, meanwhile, has reportedly asked to talk with Jeanie Buss and Magic Johnson in a meeting with the Lakers , and has reportedly stated that the incumbent Toronto Raptors would get the last pitch for his services . Per Andrew Grief of the Los Angeles Times , the Clippers are definitely in the mix for both players \u2014 but finding out when Leonard and\/or Durant will make their decision in free agency is anyone\u2019s guess: Durant, the former two-time Finals MVP and Kia MVP winner entered the offseason as perhaps the biggest name on the market alongside Kyrie Irving, Leonard and Durant\u2019s Warriors teammate, Klay Thompson. He was long been expected to draw interest on the open market from a number of teams with salary cap room. Per Grief, the Clippers have a variety of faces Durant would find familiar in GM Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian (who were with Durant in Oklahoma City for multiple seasons) as well as Jerry West (now a Clippers executive after being in Golden State with Durant). In order to land Durant and Leonard, the Clippers would need to open up more salary cap space. One such move could be to trade Danilo Gallinari, who will make $22.6 million next season. \u2014 7:45 a.m. Kemba Walker was, at times, reportedly one of the top targets on the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 free-agent radar. But with Walker seemingly set to ink a deal with the Boston Celtics later today, that option is apparently off the table for the Mavs. That doesn\u2019t mean the Mavs will be quiet in free agency as they plan to make an offer to a big free agent this summer in Tobias Harris. However, as Brad Townsend of the Dallas Morning News reports, the Mavs are expecting the Sixers to pay more to keep Harris in the fold : Harris was dealt to the Philadelphia 76ers at midseason in 2018-19 and he was solid there, averaging 18.2 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 27 games. Overall, he averaged 20 ppg, 7.9 rpg and 2.8 apg last season, which he split between the 76ers and LA Clippers. Townsend reports the Mavs are expected to formalize a five-year, $158 million deal with Kristaps Porzingis. Additionally, the Mavs remain interested in Patrick Beverley, the Dallas Morning News reports. \u2014 7:30 a.m. The Boston Celtics had not one, but two, point guards that were certain to draw interest in free agency this summer. While Kyrie Irving may already be lining up a new home for 2019-20, his understudy in Boston is fielding interest from a throng of teams. Guard Terry Rozier has potential suitors in the Indiana Pacers, Phoenix Suns and New York Knicks, per Ian Begley of SNY.tv : Rozier was a playoff hero for the Celtics in their run to the 2018 Eastern Conference finals, filling in admirably for Boston once Irving was lost for that playoff run because of knee surgery . Rozier started all 19 of Boston\u2019s 2018 playoff games, averaging 16.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists as the Celtics came within a win of reaching The Finals . However, he struggled last season, averaging 9 ppg, 3.9 rpg and 2.9 apg (after averaging 11.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg and 2.9 apg in 2017-18) and averaged 6.4 ppg, 4.3 rpg and 1.9 apg in the postseason. Adam Himmelsbach of The Boston Globe reports the Celtics have yet to rescind the qualifying offer to Rozier and that the Dallas Mavericks, Chicago Bulls and Orlando Magic are also interested in Rozier. \u2014 7:20 a.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * *"},{"id":32967,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-nba-summer-league-bit-everything","date":"2019-06-30","title":"From Zion to Jimmer, NBA Summer League is bit of everything","content":" Zion Williamson obviously knows where he\u2019s playing next season. Jimmer Fredette has no idea. Such is the beauty of Summer League: There\u2019s ballyhooed 18-year-olds like Williamson, journeyman 30-year-olds like Fredette and a whole lot of everything else set to be on display over 95 games through July 15. Most spots on summer rosters go to players looking for full-time NBA work, though most of the eyeballs will be on the top draft picks like Williamson. Four-team leagues in Salt Lake City and Sacramento open Monday. From there, the big show starts Friday in Las Vegas with all 30 NBA teams represented along with the Chinese and Croatian national teams \u2013 and tickets for Day 1, when Williamson will make his debut for the New Orleans Pelicans, were sold out several days ago. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I love to do and that\u2019s play basketball,\u201d said Williamson, the No. 1 overall draft pick this year. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t try to live up to anybody\u2019s expectations. They can set them there, but I don\u2019t feel like I have to live up to them. I\u2019m just going to be me and be the best version of myself that I can be.\u201d Fredette has the same perspective. The 2011 lottery pick \u2013 he\u2019s played for five different NBA teams not counting a preseason stint with San Antonio that didn\u2019t work out, spent time in the G League and averaged 37 points per game for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association over the last three years \u2013 has signed with the Golden State Warriors for the summer. The Warriors open play Monday in Sacramento, which was Fredette\u2019s first NBA stop. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of great opportunities in my life to go to a lot of cool places and play basketball and be successful and make great money and be able to play the game that I love,\u201d said Fredette, who had a 75-point game for Shanghai last season. \u201cSo it\u2019s been a true blessing for me and I\u2019m continuing on my journey right now, just trying to push forward and see what happens and make the best of the situation I have.\u201d Fredette, a native of Glens Falls, New York, was the AP college player of the year for BYU in 2011, and now makes his home in his wife\u2019s hometown of Denver. They have two children, the oldest not yet 3. Fredette doesn\u2019t want to be away from his wife and kids for months at a time anymore, so he\u2019s looking for a spot to play in the U.S. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be great for our young guys,\u201d Warriors summer league coach Aaron Miles said. \u201cHe has a level of understanding on how to play this game. \u2026 And he\u2019s still a bucket. I think it\u2019s great for us to have him and I think he\u2019s hopefully going to get an opportunity to show everybody that he deserves a spot in the league.\u201d Many of this year\u2019s top draft picks are expected to appear in the summer games, their pseudo-debuts of sorts at the pro level. No. 2 overall selection Ja Morant will not play for the Memphis Grizzlies when they compete in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas while he recovers from minor knee surgery. Some newly drafted players like Miami\u2019s KZ Okpala and Detroit\u2019s Joran Bone will not be able to play in any summer games right away while they remain in trade limbo. They\u2019re unable to officially join their clubs until the deals that saw their rights get swapped on draft night become finalized when the league\u2019s moratorium ends Saturday at noon Eastern. The fact that Fredette is willing to play summer league for a third time \u2013 he also did it in 2012 and 2016, and would have played in 2011 as well had that summer\u2019s games not been canceled because of the league\u2019s lockout \u2013 speaks to how much he wants a shot. He\u2019s hopeful of sticking around with the Warriors. If that doesn\u2019t work, he knows 29 other NBA teams will be watching. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m as good as I\u2019ve ever been in my career,\u201d Fredette said. \u201cAnd I hope to show it.\u201d Here\u2019s some of what to know going into the summer games: SALT LAKE CITY SUMMER LEAGUE Site: Salt Lake City Schedule: Two games a day Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday . Teams: Utah, Memphis, San Antonio, Cleveland. Format: Round robin, no playoff. Notable: New Cleveland coach John Beilein will coach the Cavs\u2019 summer team in Salt Lake City. \u2026 Among San Antonio\u2019s assistant coaches are Billy Donovan III (the son of Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan), and two women \u2013 Maine\u2019s Edneisha Curry, the only female to hold a full-time men\u2019s Division I assistant job last season, and Spain\u2019s Lorena Infantes Nunez. CALIFORNIA CLASSIC Site: Sacramento, California Schedule: Two games a day Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday . Teams: Sacramento, Miami, Golden State, Los Angeles Lakers. Format: Round robin, no playoff. Notable: Event now in its second year, and drew more than 50,000 fans last season. \u2026 Marvin Bagley III will play for the Kings in the Sacramento games, and isn\u2019t expected to play in Las Vegas. \u2026 Trey Mourning, the son of Miami legend Alonzo Mourning, is on the Heat roster. MGM RESORTS NBA SUMMER LEAGUE 2019 Site: Las Vegas Schedule: July 5-15 Teams: All 30 NBA clubs, plus national teams from China and Croatia.

It\u2019s part of a major power play by the New York franchise, which also received agreements from fellow superstar Kevin Durant and veteran center DeAndre Jordan . While Durant will likely have to sit out all of the 2019-20 season as he rehabs from the torn Achilles tendon he suffered during Golden State\u2019s Finals loss to Toronto, Irving will immediately step into a promising young Nets lineup that made the playoffs for the first time in four seasons.

Tony Jones and Shams Charania of The Athletic report that Utah is a \u201csignificant threat\u201d to sign Pacers forward Bojan Bogdanovic, an unrestricted free agent coming off a career season. Bogdanovic could complete a lineup that already includes two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert as well as Donovan Mitchell, Joe Ingles and (assuming the trade with Memphis is completed) Conley. Big man Derrick Favors is also still under contract, though it is not fully guaranteed for next season. \u2014 12:58 a.m. The Houston Rockets are always active in the offseason and this summer is no different. They are already linked in some reports to having interest in one of free agency\u2019s biggest names \u2014 Jimmy Butler \u2014 and are being linked to another name many fans may know. Per Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports , the Rockets plan to meet with former Los Angeles Lakers center JaVale McGee on Sunday. The center is coming off one of his best seasons ever, averaging 12 points, 7.5 rebounds and 2 blocks per game. He appeared in 75 games for the Lakers (62 starts) and averaged 22.3 minutes per game. Houston has targeted big men this summer, as reports of it scheduling a meeting with Golden State Warriors big man Kevon Looney also circulated Saturday. There has been talk in free agency of the Rockets potentially looking to deal starting center Clint Capela and others to clear up cap space for a potential Butler deal. \u2014 12:50 a.m. The Milwaukee Bucks have taken its first step in keeping the core of a team that advanced to the Eastern Conference finals. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports that the Bucks have extended the qualifying offer to Malcolm Brogdon, making the 26-year-old a restricted free agent and enabling the team to match any offer he accepts. Brogdon has shattered any expectations set for him as a former second-round pick, winning 2016-17 Kia Rookie of the Year honors while becoming an essential part of Milwaukee\u2019s backcourt rotation. Brogdon averaged 13.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists during the 2019 NBA playoffs as the Bucks reached the Eastern Conference finals.. The combo guard is expected to garner significant interest from teams who believe Milwaukee may balk at overspending to keep him. The Bucks are also under pressure to retain unrestricted free-agent All-Star guard Khris Middleton and starting center Brook Lopez. Reserve forward Nikola Mirotic is reportedly set to leave the NBA for Europe . \u2014 12:40 a.m. A deep free agent center class could lose one of its upper tier members. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that Nikola Vucevic plans to accept a four-year contract worth $100 million from the Orlando Magic. Vucevic has played his last seven seasons in Orlando since being part of a four-team trade that shipped Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers , Andre Iguodala to the Denver Nuggets and Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers. The former 16th overall pick is coming off his first All-Star season, one in which he averaged 20.8 points, 12.0 rebounds, 1.1 blocks and 1.0 steals per game. The 28-year-old big man also shot a career-best 36.4% on 3-pointers while leading Orlando to its first postseason appearance since 2012. \u2014 12:02 a.m. If the Clippers are fortunate enough to land reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, they may already have an idea as to whom his running mate should be. Marc Stein of The New York Times reports that LA is exploring the feasibility of signing Jimmy Butler and Leonard, a pairing that would feature two of the best perimeter defenders in the league. \u201cLeonard wants to be joined by a top-flight free agent if he decides to leave Toronto for the Clippers,\u201d Stein tweeted , \u201cand Butler\u2019s rugged two-way game makes for an intriguing pairing. Clippers adviser Jerry West is also a known admirer of Butler.\u201d \u201311:45 p.m. In a move that could portend more to come, the Houston Rockets have set up a meeting with Warriors restricted free agent center Kevon Looney according to Marc Stein of The New York Times. The 23-year-old big man is coming off a career year in which he averaged 6.3 points and 5.2 rebounds on 62.5 percent shooting. The news comes hours after word of Houston\u2019s intended meeting with Philadelphia guard Jimmy Butler. To acquire either player, the Rockets would likely need to complete sign-and-trade deals or dump salary via separate trades. \u2014 7:39 p.m. With Kemba Walker and Kyrie Irving reportedly set to negotiate deals with other teams, the Lakers reportedly have turned their attention to D\u2019Angelo Russell and now Patrick Beverley. Brad Turner of the Los Angeles Times reports that the Lakers have contacted Beverley\u2019s representatives in hopes of negotiating a deal with the free agent point guard. A respected defensive specialist with 3-point range, the 30-year-old Beverley averaged 7.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists with the Clippers last season. The veteran guard created a stir with his visibly physical defense of Kevin Durant during the opening round of the 2019 Playoffs, a six-game series that saw him log three double-digit rebounding games. \u2014 7:34 p.m. After a resurgent season in Minnesota, Derrick Rose is hoping to continue his mid-career rebirth in Michigan. The former Kia MVP and three-time All-Star is expected to meet with the Pistons on Sunday, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , in hopes of coming to terms on a two-year contract. Rose averaged 18.0 points on 48.2 percent shooting, including a career-best 37.0 percent from 3 last season. The former No. 1 overall pick has not played 70 games or more in a regular season since 2010-11, but showed enough staying power with the Timberwolves to garner interest this offseason. \u2014 7:08 p.m. Seven months after being traded for Minnesota to Philadelphia, Jimmy Butler appears intent on seeing if another change of address is warranted. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the four-time All-Star is set to meet with the Miami Heat and Houston Rockets after free agency negotiations open on Sunday evening. Butler\u2019s choice of teams are interesting due to the fact that they currently do not possess the means to sign him directly. Miami and Houston would need to execute sign-and-trade deals that send out current players in order to open up the sufficient cap space. The Rockets are currently coming off their fourth postseason defeat to the Warriors in the last five years. Miami, meanwhile have missed the playoffs in three of the past five seasons with only one postseason series victory since LeBron James left for Cleveland in 2014. \u2014 6:51 p.m. After trading for D\u2019Angelo Russell and seeing him become a 2019 All-Star, Brooklyn is reportedly ready to move on to a new point guard in Kyrie Irving. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Irving and the Nets are \u201cmotivated\u201d to come to terms on a deal once negotiations can begin Sunday evening. Irving, who recently switched to Jay-Z-founded RocNation for representation, averaged 23.8 points, 6.9 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.5 steals for Boston last season. Irving\u2019s arrival would appear to close the door on the Russell era in Brooklyn, where the former No. 2 overall pick blossomed after being traded from the Lakers in 2017. The 23-year-old guard averaged 21.1 points, 7.0 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 1.2 steals en route to the Nets\u2019 first postseason appearance since 2015. Russell\u2019s suitors include the Timberwolves, who were reported to have set up a Sunday meeting with the free agent point guard. Wojnarowski adds that the Lakers have already contacted Russell\u2019s representatives to set up a meeting. Indiana and Phoenix are also known to be seeking upgrades at point guard. \u2014 6:21 p.m. It appears as though the Boston Celtics may have found their new point guard. According to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, Kemba Walker intends to agree to a deal with the Celtics after free agency opens Sunday. Before free agency began, Walker said he was open to taking less than the supermax from Charlotte. He qualified for the supermax extension from the Hornets after making the third-team All-NBA this season, the first time Walker has made an All-NBA team in his career. Walker averaged a career-high 25.6 points and 5.9 assists for the Hornets this season while earning his third straight All-Star selection. Last season, he passed Dell Curry to become the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 all-time leading scorer and ranks in the franchise\u2019s top five in assists (No. 2), games played (No. 3), defensive rebounds (No. 4) and steals (No. 3). Aside from holding the Hornets\u2019 top scoring mark, he\u2019s also No. 1 in free throws made and attempted, field goals made and attempted and 3-pointers made and attempted. Due to the need for max cap space to sign Walker, Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports that Celtics are expected to renounce their rights to 25-year-old point guard Terry Rozier, would would make him an unrestricted free agent. \u2014 4:42 p.m. One free-agent domino appears to be off the board, as Nikola Mirotic has decided to play overseas for the upcoming season, according to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania. The 28-year-old, who averaged 15.2 points and 7.4 rebounds last season, played a key role in the Bucks\u2019 postseason run. In his five NBA seasons, Mirotic averaged 12.3 points while hitting 35.9 percent of his 3-pointers. \u2014 2:38 p.m. The Timberwolves plan to meet with restricted free agent point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, bringing in Karl-Anthony Towns as part of the contingent, reports Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes . The 23-year-old Russell has been a hot name this offseason after coming off a breakout season in which he averaged 21.1 points and 7.0 assists, helping the Nets reach the postseason. \u2014 1:54 p.m. The Nuggets are reportedly keeping a key piece around for at least another season. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Denver is picking up the option on Paul Millsap\u2019s $30 million contract. The 34-year-old forward, who helped Denver reach the semifinals in the playoffs, averaged 12.6 points and 7.2 rebounds last season. \u2014 1:01 p.m. Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard together on the same team? It sounds like that\u2019s a possibility as the two have discussed scenarios in which that happens, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne . Durant has reportedly said he\u2019ll consider four teams : Knicks, Clippers, Warriors and Nets. Leonard, meanwhile, has reportedly asked to talk with Jeanie Buss and Magic Johnson in a meeting with the Lakers , and has reportedly stated that the Raptors would get the last pitch for his services . Durant, the former two-time Finals MVP and Kia MVP winner entered the offseason as perhaps the biggest name on the market alongside Kyrie Irving, Leonard and Durant\u2019s Warriors teammate, Klay Thompson. He was long been expected to draw interest on the open market from a number of teams with salary cap room. Leonard turned down his player option for 2019-20, thus becoming an unrestricted free agent, which set off a frenzy of teams officially interested in his services. \u2014 11:55 a.m. Not many thought Klay Thompson would leave the Warriors, and that appears to be the case. According to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, Thompson and the Warriors will be agreeing on a five-year, $190 million max contract when the sides meet in Los Angeles on Sunday. Thompson has had seven straight seasons with at least 200 3-pointers, tied with Stephen Curry for the most in NBA history. He has eight straight seasons of shooting at least 40 percent from beyond the arc, which is the league\u2019s second-longest active streak in the NBA behind Curry. His 1,798 career 3s are 16th all time. Thompson, the 11th overall pick in the 2011 Draft, is a five-time All-Star and two-time third-team All-NBA player averaging 19.5 points and 42 percent 3-point shooting in his career. \u2014 12:41 p.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * *"},{"id":33005,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/four-questions-free-agency-nba","date":"2019-06-30","title":"Four big questions heading into 2019 NBA free agency","content":" The doors don\u2019t open for NBA free agency until Sunday at 6 p.m. ET, but that hasn\u2019t stopped teams\/players from lining up overnight. Meetings are reportedly scheduled, interest conveyed and options examined in advance of the league\u2019s version of Black Friday. With much of the groundwork already laid for many of the higher profile names, here\u2019s a look at the ripple effects of what we\u2019ve heard so far: Kemba Walker is reportedly set to come to terms with the Boston Celtics. Ditto for Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets . Both moves require both teams to rescind qualifying offers to their respective incumbent point guards. Translation: D\u2019Angelo Russell (Brooklyn) and Terry Rozier (Boston) will likely be free to sign wherever they wish. Russell is the next biggest point guard domino to fall, assuming Walker and Irving are truly spoken for. The Minnesota Timberwolves have reportedly already set up a meeting with him, while the Los Angeles Lakers have contacted his representatives in an effort to do so. Minnesota and L.A. may not be the last teams to want an audience with the 23-year-old All-Star. The question is whether other teams needing a point guard \u2014 including Indiana and Phoenix \u2014 want their own shot with Russell or decide to move on to less buzzworthy candidates. An unrestricted Rozier likely ranks high on that next list, with Ricky Rubio and Patrick Beverley also expected to command significant interest. Whoever misses out on all three will be left to choose among the likes of Elfrid Payton, T.J. McConnell, Cory Joseph and Ish Smith among others. None of the above three teams have cap space readily available, yet all three have reportedly secured meetings with high-profile free agents (Minnesota with Russell, the Heat and Rockets with Jimmy Butler ). Odds are good their agents would not green light such meetings without assurances the necessary money could be made available. If such avenues exist, what are they, and what other team is ready to provide them? The Timberwolves\u2019 interest in Russell would seemingly point to a desired departure from veteran point guard Jeff Teague. The 31-year-old playmaker is entering the last season of his contract. Off the court, Wolves star Karl-Anthony Towns and Russell share a deep friendship . Has Minnesota found someone interested in Teague\u2019s talent and\/or expiring contract? Or do the Timberwolves have a plan involving former No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins, who is set to begin the first year of a five-year max deal? Miami Heat president Pat Riley has never let flimsy excuses like cap space impede him from getting a meeting with superstars. Yet Miami has eight players slated to earn more than $10 million next season, and will need to shift two or three of them in order to land Butler. Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey has been, if anything, even more ambitious than Riley in recent seasons. His unexpected maneuvering to land Chris Paul in 2017 took the league by complete surprise. He should not be underestimated when it comes to cap gymnastics. Morey may be limbering up. Reported meetings with Butler and Golden State Warriors center Kevon Looney \u2014 combined with recent reports of Houston gauging trade interest in Eric Gordon and Clint Capela \u2014 suggest the Rockets may be ready to alter the supporting cast around James Harden. Actually pulling it off with Butler may require the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 help. Whether they feel compelled to give it likely depends on their fears of Butler leaving them without any compensation. Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant sit atop the free agent food chain, yet there is less solid information about them than anyone. Does Leonard want to form the next super team in Los Angeles with LeBron James and Anthony Davis? Does he wish to remain with the newly crowned Toronto Raptors? Or does he yearn for the next alpha challenge in a market like New York? What of Durant, who likely will not play at all in 2019-20? Has his time in the Bay run its course? Do reports of his interest in playing with Leonard hold water? Does his torn Achilles affect his approach at all? The Lakers, Clippers, Brooklyn Nets and New York Knicks entered the offseason with a shared goal: add star power. The Lakers already have James and Davis, but that\u2019s about all they have on their entire roster. The Nets supposedly have Irving all but ready to sign, but they opened up two max cap slots for a reason. The Clippers and Knicks both have high hopes, much cap space and zero assurances to this point (that we know of). If any of these teams whiff on the rest of the available big names, how will they pivot? Do they scramble to spend on the likes of Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton or Malcolm Brogdon? Do shorter deals with DeMarcus Cousins or DeAndre Jordan strike their fancy? Or will the teams that miss out simply spend the minimum and keep their cap space to use in trades or next summer?

Drafted out of UCLA in 2009, Collison played for the New Orleans Hornets, Indiana Pacers, Dallas Mavericks, LA Clippers and Sacramento Kings. The 31-year-old was expected to draw interest from several teams in free agency. \u2014 11:45 p.m. As many anticipated, Kevin Durant will explore his options and meet with a few teams when free agency opens up on June 30. That list of teams has reportedly been made known. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Warriors superstar \u201cplans to engage\u201d with four franchises: The Brooklyn Nets, LA Clippers, New York Knicks and Golden State Warriors. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski: \u2014 9:37 p.m. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes reported Thursday that Kawhi Leonard is expected to meet with the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers first once free agency opens on Sunday night. Now we know who he hopes to be chatting with. According to ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith, Leonard made a personal request that his meeting with the Lakers only include owner Jeanie Buss and former president of basketball operations Magic Johnson. Johnson isn\u2019t permitted to be a part of official team meetings with prospective free agents, however, as ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne points out: \u2014 5:45 p.m. The Nets have extended a qualifying offer to All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, making him a restricted free agent, reports The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania. The 23-year-old point guard is coming off a career season in which he averaged 21.1 points, 7.0 assists and 3.9 rebounds. In four NBA seasons, Russell is averaging 16.5 points and 5.1 assists. Russell was also a main reason the Nets landed back in the playoffs for the first time since 2014-15. \u2014 5:32 p.m. The Magic are readying a four-year offer to their All-Star big man Nikola Vucevic, according to The New York Times \u2018 Marc Stein. Vucevic, who averaged 20.8 points and 12.0 rebounds last season, has averaged 15.7 points and 10.1 rebounds over his eight NBA seasons, the last seven spent with the Orlando Magic. As Sports Illustrated\u2019s Chris Mannix points out, Vucevic has been a top priority this summer for the Magic. \u2014 4:35 p.m. Veteran guard George Hill will be waived by the Bucks and become a free agent, according to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania. The 33-year-old guard averaged 6.8 points in 47 games with the Bucks and 10.8 points in 13 games with the Cavaliers during the 2018-19 season. For his career, Hill has averaged 11.2 points and 3.2 assists. \u2014 4:16 p.m. The Warriors plan to offer All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson a five-year, $190 million max contract when free agency opens Sunday at 6 p.m. ET, reports ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Thompson has had seven straight seasons with at least 200 3-pointers, tied with Stephen Curry for the most in NBA history. He has eight straight seasons of shooting at least 40 percent from beyond the arc, which is the league\u2019s second-longest active streak in the NBA behind Curry. His 1,798 career 3s are 16th all time. Thompson, the 11th overall pick in the 2011 Draft, is a five-time All-Star and two-time third-team All-NBA player averaging 19.5 points and 42 percent 3-point shooting in his career. Thompson sustained a torn ACL in his left knee during Game 6 of The Finals and is in the midst of a lengthy recovery process. Recovery times vary, but ACL tears typically take roughly six months to rehab, with additional time after that to regain full strength and mobility. The Warriors can now likely turn their attention to their other star free agent: Kevin Durant. \u2014 3:30 p.m. The Sacramento Kings were on the cusp of the playoffs when they traded for Harrison Barnes last season, only to see that postseason dream fall short. Barnes reportedly declined his option with the Kings for next season, but that doesn\u2019t mean their time is necessarily over. Per multiple reports, the Kings seem to be planning on offering Barnes a four-year deal worth nearly $90 million once free agency opens on Sunday at 6 p.m. ET. Here\u2019s more from Jason Anderson of The Sacramento Bee : The New York Times \u2018 Mark Stein also reports via Twitter that a similar pact may be in the works between the sides. Teams and players can set up meetings with each other starting June 29 at 6 p.m. ET. Although Sacramento was 28-26 at the time it traded for Barnes, it sputtered down the stretch of the season and finished 39-43, nine games behind the No. 8-seeded LA Clippers. After averaging 17.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game with the Mavs (in 49 games), Barnes wasn\u2019t quite as productive with the Kings, averaging 14.3 ppg, 5.5 rpg and 1.9 apg (in 28 games). Barnes was a restricted free agent in 2016 and signed an offer sheet with the Mavs, which the incumbent Golden State Warriors could not match on the restricted free agent after they signed Kevin Durant. \u2014 2:18 p.m. At the time of the Kawhi Leonard mega-trade last summer , swingman Danny Green was seen as a player thrown into the deal to make the salaries match. Yet Green was a vital contributor to the Toronto Raptors\u2019 run to the 2019 championship (and Leonard was too, of course, garnering Finals MVP honors). Like Leonard, Green enters this summer as a free agent \u2014 although decidedly not as big of a target as Leonard is. In an interview with HoopsHype.com\u2019s Alex Kennedy, Green shared some insight into what he\u2019s looking for this summer in free agency: \u2014 9:15 a.m. Kawhi Leonard is the reigning Finals MVP and just took the Toronto Raptors to their first NBA championship. He is also a player expected to command a lot of attention in free agency this summer. It is unclear exactly which teams Leonard will speak with at this point. What does seem clear at this point \u2014 per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski \u2014 is that Leonard is expected to let the Raptors go after all the other teams in terms of making their pitch to him. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski: Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes reported yesterday that Leonard is expected to meet with the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers first once free agency opens on Sunday night. \u2014 7:29 a.m. In the past day or so, the Boston Celtics have emerged as the reported leader to snag Kemba Walker in free agency. Whether or not that happens once free-agent talks open on Sunday is another story. For the Charlotte Hornets, the thought of Walker (who has played his entire eight-season career with the franchise) leaving is an unpleasant one for a variety of reasons. How, exactly, did Charlotte get to this point with a player who has said he\u2019d take less than the supermax to stay put? Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer says it comes down to some simple numbers \u2014 and some difficult past contract decisions \u2014 that have paved this road : Aside from those facts, the re-signing of Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams to rich deals in 2016 tied up the Hornets\u2019 future salary cap space. The contracts Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Cody Zeller sport are also steep, while last summer\u2019s trade of Dwight Howard for Timofey Mozgov (who was then dealt for Bismack Biyombo) didn\u2019t help matters, either. In short, the Hornets have a tough road ahead if they plan to re-sign Walker \u2026 if they have a shot at all. \u2014 7:03 a.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * *"},{"id":32964,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/darren-collison-announces-retirement-nba","date":"2019-06-29","title":"Darren Collison announces retirement from NBA","content":" Veteran point guard Darren Collison has decided to retire from the NBA after 10 seasons to focus on his faith and family, he told ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated in a letter.

The league told teams Friday that, pending expected approval by the Board of Governors on July 9, coaches may challenge a personal foul charged to their team, a called out-of-bounds violation, a goaltending violation or a basket-interference violation. No other call may be challenged. \u201cWe anticipate this rule will be in effect in the NBA next season as a one-year pilot program,\u201d NBA Basketball Operations President Byron Spruell told teams in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press . ESPN first reported the memo\u2019s contents. The NBA already has a call-challenge program in place in the G League and tinkered with it during summer league last year. It will be used during all three Summer Leagues this season \u2014 the four-team league in Sacramento and Salt Lake City that open Monday, and the one in Las Vegas that opens July 5. Unlike the NFL version of a challenge, there\u2019s no flag to be used and teams will not retain them even if successful. A team will have to call timeout and the coach \u201cmust immediately signal for a challenge by twirling his\/her index finger toward the referees,\u201d the memo said. A challenge must come immediately after the play and challenges of out-of-bounds calls, goaltending or basket interference will not be permitted in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or the last two minutes of overtime. \u201cAs with other replay reviews, in order to overturn the event as called on the floor, there must be clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call was incorrect,\u201d the memo said. If the challenge is unsuccessful, the team will lose its timeout. If the challenge is upheld, no timeout will be charged. Also likely coming to the league: Instant replay can be triggered by officials in the review center in Secaucus, New Jersey, without the involvement of the on-court crew. The league said it wants to give the replay center the authority to review whether a shot was a 2-pointer or 3-pointer without on-court crews asking for it, as well as the ability to review potential shot-clock violations. A courtside administrator would be added to the crew at the scorer\u2019s table to communicate with the replay center and then be the liaison to announce any immediate scoring changes. For Summer League only, there will be a \u201ctransition take foul\u201d \u2014 one free throw and retention of the ball when a defender commits a take foul against any offensive player during a transition scoring opportunity but does not meet the criteria of a clear-path foul. And in Las Vegas, a new high-tech element will make its debut. What the NBA calls a \u201cconnected basketball\u201d will sometimes be in use for those games. The NBA said it has been working with Spalding and other vendors to develop a basketball with a tracking chip inside, and prototypes will be tried out during the Vegas league. Some companies have been in the smart-ball game for a few years, offering users the chance to use apps to track their accuracy and other data."},{"id":32977,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/celtics-hire-kara-lawson-assistant-ap-report","date":"2019-06-28","title":"Celtics reportedly hire Kara Lawson as assistant coach","content":" Kara Lawson is the latest woman headed to the NBA to coach.

Marc Stein of The New York Times reports Rick Welts, the Warriors\u2019 president and chief operating officer, and Bob Myers, the Warriors president of basketball operations, have each reportedly agreed to terms with the franchise on new contracts. The deal assures the Warriors of having its leadership structure in place as it moves into the Chase Center for the 2019-20 season. The news was later confirmed by the team . Welts has served in his role since September of 2011, coming to the Warriors after spending nine years with the Phoenix Suns as the team\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Before taking that role, he had spent 36 years of experience in the league in a variety of positions. Welts spent nearly two decades with the NBA (1982-99) as the executive vice president, chief marketing officer and president of NBA properties.  Additionally, Welts is a Naismith Memorial Basketball hall of Fame inductee. Myers has been with the Warriors since April of 2012 and is a two-time winner of the NBA\u2019s Executive of the Year Award (2014-15 and \u201916-17). He has presided over Golden State\u2019s most successful era, which has included five consecutive trips to The Finals and three NBA championships in that span. He was responsible for hiring Steve Kerr as coach after the 2013-14 season and the drafting of versatile forward Draymond Green in the 2012 Draft.

A person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press that the Lakers will send Moritz Wagner, Issac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones and a future second-round pick to the Washington Wizards as part of the deal that will bring Davis to Los Angeles. The Wizards will send cash to the New Orleans Pelicans in the deal, said the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement cannot be finalized until July 6. The trade was first reported by ESPN , and the cash element was first reported by The Washington Post . Shedding those contracts \u2014 along with Davis waiving his $4 million trade kicker, as ESPN reported \u2014 will give the Lakers enough cap space to sign a max player, if they are so inclined. They could also spread that cap space out among multiple players, which could be the more prudent move considering the Lakers have virtually an entire roster to fill. Once this trade is executed, the Lakers will have only James, Davis and Kyle Kuzma under contract for next season, not counting a pair of restricted free agents. The Lakers agreed earlier this month to acquire Davis from New Orleans for Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram and three first-round draft picks \u2014 one of them being De\u2019Andre Hunter, who was chosen by the Lakers on draft night and will then be traded to New Orleans and flipped from there to the Atlanta Hawks. Thursday\u2019s agreement means six players and four picks were the price the Lakers paid for Davis. It technically is not a 10-for-1 move, because the newfound cap space will bring at least one other player to Los Angeles. Wagner, Jones and Bonga were rookies last season. Wagner averaged 4.8 points in 43 games, Jones scored a total of 27 points in six games and Bonga scored 19 points in 22 appearances with the Lakers."},{"id":32946,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-gives-anthony-davis-number-23","date":"2019-06-27","title":"Report: LeBron James giving up his No. 23 to Anthony Davis","content":" It appears Lakers forward LeBron James will be going with a different number for the 2019-20 season.

Yes, it\u2019s as crazy as it seems. The reason for the blowup in importance for free agency is partly due to the buildup. The buzz in front office, media and agent circles begins a year in advance and fans are taken along for the dizzy ride. All events prior to free agency are merely appetizers to the dish. Folks are handicapping free agency in the dead of December instead of being consumed by the, you know, actual games. Yes, in terms of interest, the needle falls this way, in inverse order: Regular season, LeBron James, playoffs, NBA Finals, free agency. And the anticipation for this summer has been no different, and in some ways more bizarre than ever. Remember, this is a year where Kyrie Irving took the mic at a Boston meet-and-greet in the preseason and told Celtics fans that he\u2019d be back, to much applause, and nine months, Kyrie and the fans are still on the same page: They don\u2019t appear to want him back and the feeling is mutual. Without further delay, here are the top 25 storylines in free agency, which begins Sunday at 6 p.m. ET and probably won\u2019t end until everyone is exhausted and ready to rest up for next summer. 1. Kevin Durant. It\u2019s down to two cities, San Francisco and New York, and the three teams in those places will pony up, despite Achilles surgery and a long rehab for a soon-to-be 31 year old. The Knicks and Nets are willing to pay him four years (at $164 million) for three years of work, or in the case of the Warriors, five years ($221 million) for four. It\u2019s really all about what Durant wants \u2014 continuity or something different. But when he does return, what percentage of his former self will collect those massive checks? 2. Lakers. The pending trade for Anthony Davis and pairing him with LeBron has rekindled interest in, if not respect for, the glamour franchise. Yes, the Lakers sacrificed their future for Davis, which makes it important that they aim to win now with LeBron on the clock. They cannot go to basketball war next season with just those two; that said, while they\u2019d certainly like to add an A-list type like Kawhi Leonard, secondary stars such as Kemba Walker would make the Lakers a title favorite as well. Still in question is whether the $32 million or so ( after reported trade with Wizards ) that the Lakers can offer will be enough to sway a big name to make a financial sacrifice. They may be left signing a pair of C-list players. 3. Kawhi Leonard. With Durant\u2019s injury, a case can be made for Kawhi being the cream of the free-agent crop. He\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s coming off a championship and as he just showed in Toronto that he can change a team\u2019s fortunes instantly even if there\u2019s a gap between him and the club\u2019s next best player. The problem for suitors other than Toronto is money. When Leonard forced his way out of San Antonio two summers ago, that cost him a chance at the super max; if he bails on the Raptors as well, all told he will have lost roughly $80 million by moving twice. That\u2019s financial malpractice by anyone\u2019s standard. And that\u2019s bad news for a certain team that\u2019s only missing a star. Which leads us to \u2026 4. Clippers. Imagine being a free agent and meeting billionaire Steve Ballmer, player-friendly coach Doc Rivers and The Logo himself, Jerry West. What other team can offer that level of clout? Plus, there\u2019s the chance to play in LA and enjoy all the trappings of that. And the Clippers have a ready-made team with Lou Williams, Danilo Gallinari, Montrezl Harrell, Landry Shamet and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander along with additional money if necessary to add a second free agent. And yet, if they don\u2019t get Kawhi, their main target, they could end up saving most of their $54 million for next summer. 5. Warriors. Did the injury create bad vibes between Durant and the Warriors? If so (and KD has been coy ever since falling to the floor), then he\u2019ll walk. And if that happens, the Warriors are too cap-stressed to replace him immediately. Klay Thompson will test the market if the Warriors even hesitate to give him the max. Even if Thompson signs, he isn\u2019t expected back from knee surgery until spring, if then. 6. Kyrie Irving. All road signs point to Brooklyn, and yet, where did it all go wrong with the Celtics? Irving is a different guy, and his complex personality caused plenty of ill will in Boston, first from his lack of leadership in the regular season when times got tough, then in the playoffs when he fizzled. He\u2019s a supreme talent, no doubt, but the package comes wrapped in tiny red flags. 7. Knicks. They cleared $60 million in cap space for two big name free agents and may not get any. Was Andre Iguodala\u2019s forecast correct when he said \u201cnobody\u2019s going to the Knicks?\u201d Even if they get Durant, who\u2019s coming with him? If they whiff on also adding Kyrie in that scenario, the Knicks better not panic and overpay Nikola Vucevic. Just spend it next summer; what\u2019s another lost year, anyway, especially with KD on the shelf until 2020? 8. Danny Ainge. Historians will pinpoint the death of a dynasty that never was on opening night two years ago when Gordon Hayward fell awkwardly. Suddenly, the bounty of picks Ainge stole from the Nets amounted to little in terms of the bottom line for the team he runs. The Celtics are recreating their identity now. Ainge should instead set his sights on Kemba Walker. 9. Raptors. If Kawhi stays, the Raptors will be favorites to emerge from the East next season. If he leaves, it won\u2019t be a total disaster. They can play out the upcoming season, still have enough to make the playoffs, then clear a ton of space for 2020 when the deals of Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka disappear. 10. Jimmy Butler. He\u2019s 29 and had turbulent stints in Minnesota and to a degree Chicago. He was mellow in Philly last season but he had every reason to be, with free agency approaching. Butler is a solid player yet hardly a superstar. Can he be comfortable as a lesser option on the Lakers, or the Rockets if Houston does a sign-and-trade? Big questions for any team kicking his tires. 11. Michael Jordan. The Hornets owner is on record saying he won\u2019t pay the luxury tax for a non-contender, and if true, that means he\u2019s offering Kemba something short of the max, at most. And even that isn\u2019t a guarantee. If Walker leaves and the Hornets are stuck with a bad team that\u2019s weighed down by poor contracts, then Jordan will be the goat in another sense of the word. 12. Nets. They have $60 million to spend and a solid supporting cast already in place to compliment any incoming superstar, singular or plural. Their issue lies with any pursuit of Kyrie; does that mean the Nets will part ways with D\u2019Angelo Russell, who\u2019s younger and would be cheaper to keep? That all depends on if the Nets sign two big free agents. If not, they may roll the dice on a Kyrie-D-Lo backcourt and hope the chemistry works. 13. Kemba Walker. He doesn\u2019t want to leave Charlotte and he committed the negotiating sin of saying he\u2019ll take less than the max to stay. We\u2019ll see how devoted Walker is when other teams start to swoop. For someone who has never been to the second round, let\u2019s see him say no to a contender who can pay good, but not great, money. Does he want to win or get paid? Can\u2019t have both. 14. Bucks. After a 60-win uplifting season, the Bucks must cope with the free agency of Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and Nikola Mirotic. It\u2019s a sticky situation; they don\u2019t have Bird rights for Lopez and they can\u2019t replace Middleton with a similar talent if Middleton leaves. Above all, they must show Giannis Antetokounmpo that they\u2019re serious about keeping the band together or at least remain a title contender. 15. Al Horford. He just left $26 million on the table in Boston by opting out. Who does that at age 33 with declining skills? This smells like an overpay upcoming. 16. Khris Middleton. He\u2019s a floor-stretcher whose shooting range is valuable in today\u2019s NBA. He\u2019ll be in demand and the Bucks may have no choice but to max him out, especially if a darkhorse team like the Mavericks ($47 million in cap room) come calling with a close-enough offer for a player who played his college ball in Texas. 17. D\u2019Angelo Russell. Can you imagine a scenario that leads him back to the Lakers? He\u2019s a restricted free agent and no way the Nets let him walk for nothing even if they sign Irving, but still. Watch out for a massive offer sheet from the Suns, who are salivating over a possible Russell-Devin Booker duo. 18. Malcolm Brogdon. The Bucks got jumpy last spring and extended Eric Bledsoe to the tune of $17 million a season, and some scouts feel Brogdon is better, or will be in the long run. Even though point guards are plentiful, he may become the best value signing of the summer. 19. Elton Brand. The Sixers\u2019 new GM received plenty of back-slaps last February when he rolled the dice and swapped the future for Tobias Harris. If Harris leaves in free agency and Butler follows, that trade with the Clippers backfired in hindsight. 20. Julius Randle. He improved his offense and became a solid double-double guy at age 23. He\u2019s about to cash checks. Maybe from the Mavericks since Randle is from Dallas. 21. Klay Thompson. If the Warriors pay him, and they will, he\u2019s staying. Nothing else to see here. Move along. 22. JR Smith and Carmelo Anthony. Wait, seriously, are the Lakers really giving this some thought a year after signing Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley? 23. Pacers. They are suspiciously under the radar as a reasonably big player in free agency. Indiana has $32 million in cap space and Victor Oladipo coming back from surgery next season. Malcolm Brogdon might be a good fit here. But they probably should save some to re-sign Bojan Bogdanovic. 24. Class of 2016. Congratulations to Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng and Allen Crabbe and Evan Turner and others who heisted the reckless GMs in the bloated summer of \u201916. Someone mediocre is about to come along and sign for something more outrageous in a few days, just watch. 25. Giannis Antetokounmpo. He\u2019s not a free agent, but he\u2019s listed here because the 2021 countdown for the new Kia MVP, alas, has already begun. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania adds that the Lakers are also sending Washington their 2022 second-round pick. The move means the Lakers will start free agency with $32 million in cap space and now have the ability to sign a max player. Helping matters was the fact that Davis agreed to waive his $4M trade kicker, reports Wojnarowski . \u2014 2:27 p.m. Thunder big man Nerlens Noel won\u2019t be picking up his $1.9 million player option and will become a free agent, according to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania. The 25-year-old center, who was the sixth overall pick in the 2013 Draft, averaged 4.9 points and 4.2 rebounds last season while shooting 58.7 from the field. \u2014 2:05 p.m. With Kyrie Irving and Al Horford both threatening to bolt Boston this summer in free agency, big changes could be on the horizon for the Celtics. Now it appears the Celtics may very well land a star free agent of their own. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Celtics have cropped up as the favorite to sign All-Star guard Kemba Walker. Walker has been selected for the last three All-Star games and was named a starter this year for the first time. He averaged a career-high 25.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game last season along with 5.9 assists while playing in all 82 games. The eight-year NBA veteran initially said the Hornets, who can offer him a five-year \u201csupermax\u201d contract worth up to $221 million, would remain his first priority, but he said he\u2019s \u201cpretty sure\u201d he will meet with other interested teams before making a decision on his future. \u2014 9:22 a.m."},{"id":33014,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-offseason-2019-roundup-june-26","date":"2019-06-27","title":"NBA Offseason 2019: June 26 roundup","content":" The NBA offseason is in full swing, with talk of trades and other player movement starting to bubble up.

The long-time reporter tweeted that if New York misses out on signing injured superstar Kevin Durant, the franchise could very well shift its attention to one of Durant\u2019s teammates: DeMarcus Cousins. Cousins is coming off his first year with Golden State in which he played just 30 regular season games and eight postseason appearances. His sporadic availability was due to the fact that he intially arrived while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. The former All-Star center then suffered a torn quad muscle during the first round of the NBA Playoffs. Cousins returned from each injury and provided sparks of his former self, including a double-double performance in Game 2 of the Finals against Toronto. It appears New York is eager to bring in some big-name free agent talent to join No. 3 overall pick RJ Barrett. The Knicks have not made the playoffs since 2012-13. New Orleans is reportedly ready to move on from Stanley Johnson four years after Detroit drafted him eighth overall. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that the Pelicans will not extend a qualifying offer to the 23-year-old small forward, a move that makes him an unrestricted free agent. \u2014 9:00 p.m. In a free agent market flush with big men, Enes Kanter could be a bargain option for would-be contenders. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports that Portland, Los Angeles and Boston will all express interest in the veteran big man when free agency negotiations commence next week. Kanter is coming off a surprisingly effective playoff run with the Blazers in which eh averaged 11.4 points and 9.7 rebounds during Portland\u2019s Western Conference finals run. \u2014 8:45 p.m. With so many teams pursuing the top-level free agents, the LA Clippers have reportedly already begun setting up their backup plan. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic , the Clippers \u201cshould express interest\u201d in Tobias Harris if they fail to land Raptors superstar Kawhi Leonard. Harris, of course, was traded by the same Clippers franchise to Philadelphia just four months ago. That transaction, according to Charania, appears to have done little to no damage to Harris\u2019 regard for the up-and-coming Clippers. \u2014 8:22 p.m. Looking to acquire Jimmy Butler from the 76ers in a sign-and-trade, the Rockets have offered Clint Capela, Eric Gordon and P.J. Tucker individually to teams with cap space, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe . The Rockets are hoping to team Butler with Chris Paul and James Harden in hopes of making a deeper postseason run in 2019-20. But as Wojnarowski points out, Philadelphia remains optimistic it can re-sign both Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris. One Houston player is hoping the team doesn\u2019t make any drastic changes this offseason, reports ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . \u2014 3:26 p.m. Kevin Durant reportedly declined his option for 2019-20 with the Golden State Warriors earlier today. Last week, Toronto Raptors star Kawhi Leonard did likewise . That makes both players unrestricted free agents with calendars that are sure to fill up with free-agent meetings once the gates open at 6:01 p.m. on July 1. Earlier today, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported the New York Knicks are expected to be among the teams pursuing Durant. The same has been said about the Knicks and Leonard, too. The Athletic\u2019s Frank Isola reported today that the Knicks are expecting to get meetings with both Durant and Leonard once free agency opens. Once that takes place, the Knicks are expected to then meet with second-tier free agents in Los Angeles. Additionally, Ian Begley of SNY.tv reports the Knicks indeed have interest in Leonard and could be interested in pairing him with another big name on the market: Philadelphia 76ers guard Jimmy Butler. Per Begley, multiple teams have expressed interest in pairing Leonard and Butler together as well. However, it is worth noting that the Raptors and Sixers can offer Leonard and Butler, respectively, contracts of greater value than any other team can. \u2014 2:50 p.m. NBA teams have until July 29 to make qualifying offers to their own free agents and several have apparently gotten done today. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Phoenix Suns have made a qualifying offer to Kelly Oubre Jr., which will make him a restricted free agent this summer. Oubre Jr. was dealt to the Suns at mideseason and played well there, averaging 16.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.4 steals in 29.5 minutes per game. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Grizzlies have extended a qualifying offer to Delon Wright, which will make him a restricted free agent this summer. Wright saw a much bigger role and increased playing time in Memphis, averaging 12.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.6 steals in 30.8 minutes per game. Along with second-year forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and rookie guard Ja Morant, Wright is one of the key youngsters Memphis is building around. The Grizzlies also potentially freed up significant minutes for Wright with their reported trade of starting point guard Mike Conley to the Utah Jazz last week. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Wolves have given a qualifying offer to Tyus Jones, making him a restricted free agent this summer. The move was also reported by Chris Hine of The Star Tribune . Last season, Jones averaged 6.9 points, 4.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game in 68 games (with 23 starts). Those stats (save for the games played) were all career bests as Jones continued to develop after being selected 24th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 draft. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports that the Knicks will not extend a qualifying offer to Emmanuel Mudiay, the seventh overall pick of the 2015 NBA Draft. The 23-year-old point guard averaged a career-high 24.8 points, 3.9 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 59 games for New York last season. Haynes adds that the Knicks made the decision with the goal of opening up more cap space but still hope to re-sign Mudiay before their offseason is done. \u2014 2:47 p.m. Free agency\u2019s opening bell has yet to sound, yet the Dallas Mavericks find themselves in reported links with several key players. From Kemba Walker to Patrick Beverley to Nikola Mirotic and more, the Mavs\u2019 name has been bandied about as a potential landing spot for those standouts and others. Brad Townsend of the Dallas Morning News spoke with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who cautioned against fans and media reading too much into talks of reported meetings. Here\u2019s more from Cuban via Townsend : \u2014 1:47 p.m. Omer Asik, who was sidelined by injuries for many years after a promising start to his career, is apparently done in Chicago. The Bulls were due to pay Asik the remaining $3 million on his contract next season, but that has been taken off the books via career-ending injury and illness, reports Shams Charania of The Athletic . In doing so, the Bulls now have upwards of $23 million in salary cap space to pursue free agents with this summer. Asik signed a five-year, $58 million deal with the New Orleans Pelicans in the summer of 2015 (after spending two seasons with the Houston Rockets), but struggled to stay on the court due to a variety of injuries. The Bulls re-acquired Asik \u2014 who played for Chicago from 2010-12 \u2014 in the trade that sent Nikola Mirotic to the New Orleans Pelicans in 2018. \u2014 1:04 p.m. The Minnesota Timberwolves have watched as guard Tyus Jones has steadily grown as a contributor for them over the past four seasons. As Jones enters free agency this summer, the Wolves are taking the first step toward potentially keeping him around even longer. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Wolves have given a qualifying offer to Jones, making him a restricted free agent this summer. The move was also reported by Chris Hine of The Star Tribune . In the 2018-19 season, Jones averaged 6.9 points, 4.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game in 68 games (with 23 starts). Those stats (save for the games played) were all career bests as Jones continued to develop after being selected 24th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 draft. \u2014 12:55 p.m. One of the biggest fish in the 2019 free-agent pond is reportedly opting out of his deal. Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant has declined his option for next season and will become an unrestricted free agent, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . Durant and his business manager, Rich Kleiman, are in New York and are evaluating Durant\u2019s free agency options, Wojnarowski reports , and the process has remained private. \u2014 11:56 a.m. Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard and just about every other big-name free agent this summer is rumored to be on the New York Knicks\u2019 shopping list. Whether or not they get any of them, of course, is another story. If New York should happen to miss out on any of them, it could shift to signing players to short-term deals and pushing its cap space into next summer. Should that scenario come to pass, Ian Bagley of SNY.tv has some players who could be prime candidates for those types of contracts. The two biggest names that jump out? Vince Carter and former Knicks star Carmelo Anthony. Here\u2019s more from Bagley on the chances of either player landing in the Big Apple come 2019-20: \u2014 10:06 a.m. Ever since Mark Cuban took over as owner of the franchise 19 years ago, the Dallas Mavericks have been a busy squad in free agency. Such appears to be the case again this summer, with Dallas sporting a sizable amount of salary-cap space and several key free agents on Dallas\u2019 radar. Already, the Mavs have been linked in reports to Charlotte Hornets star Kemba Walker and some other free agents appear to be in Dallas\u2019 mix as well. Per Brad Townsend of the Dallas Morning News , the Mavericks have interest in LA Clippers guard and defensive ace Patrick Beverley as well as sharp-shooting big man Nikola Mirotic (who split last season between the New Orleans Pelicans and Milwaukee Bucks). Townsend reports Beverley and the Mavs regard each other as the \u201cperfect fit \u201d (Beverley, in a Q&A with NBA.com, sounded excited about the prospect of playing in Dallas next season). Dallas is expected to meet with Beverley once free agency opens on Sunday, but an appointment between the two has not yet been scheduled, Townsend writes. As for Mirotic, he is further down on the Mavs\u2019 wish list. There have also been talks in the past \u2014 including from the Dallas Morning News \u2014 that Orlando Magic center Nikola Vucevic may be a target for Dallas. However, Vucevic\u2019s steep asking price may keep him from landing there, Townsend writes. Here\u2019s more: \u2014 7:45 a.m. Those reports that circulated yesterday via The New York Times\u2019 Mark Stein about the Boston Celtics (and others) being interested in Kemba Walker are apparently true. Walker has stated recently \u2014 several times, in fact \u2014 that the incumbent Charlotte Hornets are the first priority in his free agency tour and that he\u2019d be willing to take less than the supermax to stay put. That is all well and good, but the challenge for Charlotte in re-signing Walker is not in that transaction, but in how doing so would affect the team\u2019s ability to build a better squad around their All-Star guard. Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer explains how the Hornets would face a sticky situation should Walker re-sign this summer: Team owner Michael Jordan has said he does not want the Hornets to be a luxury-tax payer, Bonnell also writes, unless the team is in immediate contention to advance deep in the playoffs. Since Walker has been on the Hornets, the team has made the playoffs three times (2010, \u201914 and \u201916) but has never won more than two games in any playoff run. \u2014 7:18 a.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * *"},{"id":46360,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-mavericks-isaiah-roby-deividas-sirvydis-trade-release","date":"2019-06-27","title":"Pistons complete Draft night trade with Mavericks","content":"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. \u2013 The Detroit Pistons announced today the completion of a draft night trade that sent the draft rights to Isaiah Roby and two future second-round picks to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Deividas Sirvydis.

The announcement was made this morning by Williams on the Suns podcast, The Outlet, which can be viewed here . \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege for me to announce our coaching staff,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIn assembling a staff, the goal was simple: identify high-character individuals with high-level experience who will work relentlessly to develop a culture of championship habits here in Phoenix. The members of this staff have combined to win multiple NBA titles, conference titles and NCAA titles, bring significant coaching and playing experience at the NBA level, and recognize the attention to details that create the foundation for successful teams. It\u2019s a tremendous collection of bright basketball minds who are also outstanding people, and we are already hard at work.\u201d Green, 37, joins the Suns following three seasons as assistant coach\/player development for the Golden State Warriors. In each of his first two seasons as a coach, he helped the Warriors win back-to-back NBA Championships in 2017 and 2018 before returning to the NBA Finals in 2019, and has received high praise from many in Golden State\u2019s organization and beyond for his coaching knowledge and demeanor. Green served as the Warriors\u2019 head coach for NBA Summer League in 2018, both in Las Vegas and at the inaugural California Classic in Sacramento where he led Golden State to the event\u2019s only perfect 3-0 record. A 12-year NBA veteran as a player, Green averaged 8.3 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 731 regular season games (297 starts) with Philadelphia, New Orleans, Atlanta, the LA Clippers and Orlando from 2003-2015. The 6-4 shooting guard played his first seven seasons in Philadelphia, including in 2007-08 when he averaged a career-high 12.4 points for the 76ers. He qualified for the playoffs seven times in his 12 seasons, averaging 5.2 points in 36 career playoff games (12 starts). In 2010-11, Green was a member of Williams\u2019 first team as a head coach, averaging 8.7 points while appearing in 77 games to help New Orleans win 46 games and earn a playoff berth. Prior to being selected with the 41st overall pick by Seattle in 2003, Green was a four-year standout at the University of Detroit Mercy. A native of Detroit, he won Horizon League Player of the Year as a senior in 2003 and helped the Titans to two NIT appearances in 2001 and 2002, including a trip to the semifinals at Madison Square Garden in 2001. Green remains fourth in program history in career points scored. Rajakovic (pronounced RYE-ahk-oe-vich ), 40, comes to the Suns after seven seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder organization, spending the last five as an assistant coach. The Thunder averaged 49 wins in his five seasons as an assistant coach with four playoff appearances, including a trip to the Western Conference Finals in 2016 when he shared the bench with Williams and Bryant. Rajakovic served as the Thunder\u2019s head coach at NBA Summer League in 2014 and 2015. In 2012, the Serbian native initially joined the Thunder organization as head coach of their NBA G League affiliate, the Tulsa 66ers, becoming the first head coach born outside North America in NBA G League history. In two seasons as Tulsa\u2019s head coach, Rajakovic recorded a 51-49 record and a trip to the G League semifinals in 2013. In 2014, while Rajakovic was serving as Tulsa\u2019s head coach, Oklahoma City head coach Scott Brooks included him as one of his assistant coaches at the 2014 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. Prior to joining the Thunder organization, Rajakovic spent three years as head coach of Torrelodones in Spain. In his first season, he led Torrelodones to the championship of the Primera Division de Baloncesto in Madrid, earning promotion to Liga EBA, Spain\u2019s fourth-tier professional league. Rajakovic began his coaching career at 16 years old with the youth teams of Borac Cacak in his hometown of Cacak, Serbia. After three years with Borac Cacak, he was named the head coach of the U20 and U18 teams of Red Star Belgrade and led Red Star to two Serbian championships in his eight years in Belgrade. Rajakovic received a basketball coaching degree from the Belgrade Basketball Academy in 2004 and a degree in sports management from Alfa BK University in Belgrade in 2006. During educational tours of college basketball programs in the U.S., Rajakovic spent time attending practices and meeting with Lute Olson at the University of Arizona in 2003 and Mike Krzyzewski at Duke University in 2007. Bryant, a former Suns player, returns to Phoenix after most recently spending 12 seasons as an assistant coach with the Oklahoma City Thunder. His tenure with the Thunder featured a Western Conference Championship in 2012, plus three additional trips to the Western Conference Finals, including in 2016 when Williams was the team\u2019s associate head coach. Bryant joined the Thunder franchise in 2007 before the team\u2019s final season in Seattle then relocated to Oklahoma City and helped one of the league\u2019s youngest rosters develop into a team that has averaged 52 wins and made the playoffs nine times over the last 10 seasons. Prior to joining the Thunder\u2019s coaching staff, Bryant served as assistant coach\/player development with the Orlando Magic from 2005-2007 and his first coaching job was as a member of the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 player development staff in 2004-05.

Bryant played 15 total NBA seasons from 1988-2003 with Portland, Houston, Phoenix, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Denver and Boston, averaging 5.4 points on 50.0% shooting and 3.8 rebounds in 797 regular season games, and also appeared in 79 playoff games with trips to the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992 as a member of the Trail Blazers. Bryant and Williams were teammates together with the 76ers for part of the 2002-03 season. Originally the 21st overall pick in the first round of the 1988 NBA Draft by Portland, Bryant played four seasons at Seton Hall University and left the program ranked fifth in school history in total points and total rebounds. He was a First Team All-Big East selection as a senior in 1987-88 when he averaged 20.5 points and 9.1 rebounds to lead the P.J. Carlesimo-coached Pirates to their first-ever NCAA tournament berth. Bryant is a native of Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Ayers, 63, brings to the Suns over 35 years of coaching experience, including as an NBA and college head coach, and has most recently spent the past three seasons as a pro scout with the Brooklyn Nets. He served as an assistant coach on Williams\u2019 staff in New Orleans for all five seasons Williams was the team\u2019s head coach from 2010-2015. Ayers has spent 17 total seasons on an NBA bench and was head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers for the majority of the 2003-04 season. He was a member of Larry Brown\u2019s staff with the 76ers from 1997-2003, where he coached both Williams and Bryant, then was Green\u2019s first NBA head coach with Philadelphia in 2003-04. Ayers also spent two seasons as an assistant coach with both the Orlando Magic (2005-2007) and Washington Wizards (2007-2009), and another season as an assistant coach with Philadelphia in 2009-10, before joining Williams\u2019 staff in New Orleans.

Prior to becoming a coach in the NBA, Ayers coached collegiately, including eight seasons as head coach at The Ohio State University from 1989-1997. Ayers\u2019 best seasons came in 1990-91 and 1991-92 when he led the Buckeyes to consecutive No. 1 regional seeds in the NCAA tournament, advancing to the Sweet 16 in 1991 and the Elite Eight in 1992. He was the Big Ten Coach of the Year in both seasons and was the consensus national coach of the year for 1990-91. He spent six seasons as an assistant coach at Ohio State before elevating to the program\u2019s head coaching position. Ayers entered coaching as a graduate assistant for two seasons at his alma mater, Miami University in Ohio, then spent two seasons as an assistant coach at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point before joining Ohio State\u2019s staff.

Before entering the coaching ranks, Greer played collegiately at Northeastern University and was the team\u2019s captain during his senior season in 1988-89. The native of New York, New York received his bachelor\u2019s degree from Northeastern. His brother, Andy, is also an experienced NBA assistant coach. Blake, 39, comes to Phoenix after spending the last two seasons working for the Portland Trail Blazers. A 13-year NBA veteran as a player, Blake last played in 2016 and entered the coaching ranks with Portland, first as a coaching intern in 2017-18 then as an on-court assistant in 2018-19 where he helped the team advance to the Western Conference Finals. Blake\u2019s most successful seasons as a player came with Portland in 2005-06 and from 2007-2010 when Williams served as an assistant coach for the Trail Blazers. As Portland\u2019s starting point guard, Blake averaged a career-high 11.0 points in 2008-09 and a career-high 5.1 assists in 2007-08, helping the Trail Blazers improve from 32 wins before he returned in 2007 to 41 wins in 2007-08 then 54 wins and a playoff berth in 2008-09. In addition to playing under Williams as an assistant coach with Portland for the 2007-08 season, Blake was a teammate of Suns General Manager James Jones.

He led the ACC in assists per game in each of his final three seasons, and led the NCAA in total assists in 2002. Blake played in all 138 games during his college career and remains Maryland\u2019s all-time leader in games started (136) and assists (972) with 200 more assists than second place. Born in Hollywood, Florida, Blake completed his high school playing career at Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia. Fois, 32, comes to the Suns after spending the past five seasons working for Gonzaga University\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program, elevating to the title of director of analytics. In his role at Gonzaga, Fois handled video breakdown and exchange, evaluated player analytics and assisted the coaching staff with day-to-day program operations. The Bulldogs advanced at least as far as the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament in all five of Fois\u2019 seasons, and he helped the program reach its first-ever Final Four in 2017, played in Arizona, when Gonzaga finished as national runner-up. Fois also assisted Gonzaga\u2019s head coach Mark Few as the video coordinator for the 2015 USA Basketball Pan American Games Team coached by Few that won bronze in Toronto.

When he first moved to the United States, Fois played one season at Pepperdine in 2007-08 and was named to the WCC Commissioner\u2019s Honor Roll. Strong, 32, joins the Suns after spending the 2018-19 season in player development for the Philadelphia 76ers where he worked alongside Williams to help the Sixers reach the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Following a lengthy playing career in the NBA G League and overseas, Strong entered the coaching ranks as assistant coach with the men\u2019s basketball program at Huntingdon College for two seasons from 2016-2018.  A 6-11 forward\/center as a player, Strong played five seasons in the G League from 2011-2016, averaging 7.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 183 career games with the Iowa Energy, Delaware 87ers, Austin Toros and Westchester Knicks. He averaged career highs of 11.1 points and 7.3 rebounds with Westchester in 2014-15, then was a member of the New York Knicks\u2019 team at NBA Summer League 2015. In addition to his time in the G League, Strong played professionally for Maccabi Haifa in the Israeli Premier League from 2008-2010, and also with clubs in the Netherlands, Uruguay and, most recently, New Zealand in 2016.  Before his professional career, he was the 2007 NABC Division III Co-Player of the Year at Guilford College. Strong was a two-time All-American, two-time Old Dominion Athletic Conference Player of the Year and three-time all-conference selection at Guilford, leaving as the Quakers\u2019 second all-time leading scorer.

Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant has declined his option for next season and will become an unrestricted free agent, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . Durant and his business manager, Rich Kleiman, are in New York and are evaluating Durant\u2019s free agency options, Wojnarowski reports, and the process has remained private. The news was also reported by Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle. If Durant were to re-sign with the Warriors, he could ink a five-year, $221 million deal. If he signs with another team, the most he can get is a four-year, $164 million deal. Wojnarnowski reports Durant is still considering staying put, but the New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets and LA Clippers are all believed to be in the running for him as well. The former two-time Finals MVP and Kia MVP winner enters the offseason as perhaps the biggest name on the market alongside the Boston Celtics\u2019 Kyrie Irving, the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Kawhi Leonard and Durant\u2019s Warriors teammate, Klay Thompson. Durant has long been expected to draw interest on the open market from a number of teams with salary cap room. Durant suffered a ruptured right Achilles in Game 5 of The Finals and the timetable for his return date is unknown. He got hurt on a dribble on the right wing, coming up lame on a crossover move and falling to the floor. He grabbed the back of his leg, appeared to grab below the calf and more toward the Achilles area, and needed help to limp to the bench area and more help to get back to the Warriors\u2019 locker room. Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was on Durant\u2019s left side as they made the long walk back to the room, with Warriors GM Bob Myers and Curry in the group immediately behind them. Players have made comebacks off Achilles surgery, with relative levels of success. This is Durant\u2019s first serious injury since the 2014-15 season with the Oklahoma City Thunder, when a fracture in his right foot ultimately limited him to 27 games. In October of 2014, he suffered a \u201cJones fracture\u201d in his foot and had surgery that sidelined him until December of that year . He played off and on for the next two months before he was shut down for the season to have a third surgery on the fractured bone in his foot. Since joining the Warriors in the summer of 2016, Durant has been mostly healthy. He missed 19 straight games in his first season with Golden State because of a strained MCL in his left knee . He missed two first-round playoff games in 2017 as well because of a strained left calf muscle , but was healthy the rest of the way en route to his first Finals MVP honors and first NBA championship . This season, Durant averaged 26 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.1 blocks per game. In the playoffs, he averaged 32.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 4.5 apg and 1 bpg. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33058,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-offseason-2019-roundup-june-25","date":"2019-06-25","title":"NBA Offseason 2019: June 25 roundup","content":" The NBA offseason is in full swing, with talk of trades and other player movement starting to bubble up. As well, free agency is set to open at 6 p.m. on June 30. Keep up on all the latest news, talks and more as the offseason takes flight: * Rockets reportedly eyeing 76ers\u2019 Butler * Mavs to meet with Porzingis, offer max deal * Iguodala chimes in (again) on Durant, Thompson * Report: Celtics a suitor for Walker * Ujiri wants to keep roster in tact * Mitchell, Conley build some early chemistry * Warriors to talk future with Thompson, Durant this week * Beal: Wizards\u2019 brass says I won\u2019t be moved * Morey: Rockets could add \u2018top-level mid-level\u2019 player * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft * * * After coming up short to the Warriors the last two seasons, Houston is reportedly setting its sights on yet another talent upgrade. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski writes that the Rockets are hoping to arrange a sign-and-trade arrangement that will net them four-time All-Star Jimmy Butler. A potential Butler departure would come less than a year after Philadelphia dealt Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick to acquire him. Houston, meanwhile, appears intent on making changes even under the weight of its current salary cap situation, which includes max contracts for Chris Paul and James Harden. \u2014 7:00 p.m. When free agency opens on June 30, the Mavericks plan on offering Kristaps Porzingis a five-year, $158 million max deal, according to The Athletic \u2018s Shams Charania. According to Sports Illustrated \u2018s Chris Mannix, Porzingis seemed to forge a solid relationship with rookie Luka Doncic last season. The 23-year-old Porzingis was acquired by Dallas in a blockbuster deal with the New York Knicks before the trading deadline but hasn\u2019t played for the club. He missed the 2018-19 season after tearing a ligament in his left knee in what turned out to be his final game for the Knicks in February 2018. \u2014 4:06 p.m. Golden State Warriors forward Andre  Iguodala doubled down in a sense on his hope that Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson will be back come 2019-20. Durant can opt out of his deal and Thompson is an unrestricted free agent, yet both players are expected to miss large parts of next season after they suffered serious injuries in The Finals . In an interview on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d podcast with Power 105.1 FM in New York, Iguodala responded as follows when asked if he thought Durant and Thompson would be back: \u201cPretty sure, pretty sure. I think KD\u2019s coming back. I hope he does. I mean, we want him to come back.\u201d https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v He was then asked if, prior to Durant rupturing his right Achilles tendon in Game 5 of The Finals, was he feeling the same way about Durant coming back. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s the hard part of it to. Everyday we had to deal with that, like, the whole year we had to deal with that. \u2018Is KD coming back?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018man, I hope so, yeah. What you want me to say?\u2019 \u201d Iguodala said. \u201cBut at the same time, it was like, where there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire. Well, who\u2019s putting out these reports? Sometimes they\u2019re fake, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s what. That\u2019s the drama of the NBA.\u201d Iguodala has been promoting his new memoir, \u201cThe Sixth Man,\u201d and appeared on Monday\u2019s edition of CNBC\u2019s \u201cPower Lunch\u201d . He offered some insight on Durant and Thompson, while also ribbing\/trolling for New York Knicks fans. \u201cI think they\u2019ll both be back with the Golden State Warriors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers, we keep in contact, but regardless of any of that, if both did decide to leave they would still be my brother. I would still keep in contact with them as much as possible. I\u2019m just wishing the best for those guys and they come back full strength.\u201d After he was told he was crushing the hopes of Knicks fans, Iguodala said: \u201cNobody is going to the Knicks, sorry.\u201d (It is worth noting, of course, that Iguodala was smiling as he said this and was likely just making a joke.) When asked on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d about Durant and Thompson heading to the Knicks, Iguodala \u2014 if nothing else \u2014 stayed on message. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cI personally think ya\u2019ll are going to strike out.\u201d \u2014 1:39 p.m. Point guard Kyrie Irving and center Al Horford were each crucial to the Boston Celtics\u2019 success over the last few seasons. However, both are reportedly not opting into their deals with Boston for next season and seem likely to leave this summer . If that happens, Boston is at a point where it could be severely lacking in backcourt and frontcourt help. One solution to that potential problem would be to purse another top name in free agency, and The New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein reports Charlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker may be on Boston\u2019s list. \u2014 1:09 p.m. Life is pretty great for the Toronto Raptors, who are not even two weeks removed from winning their first NBA championship. GM Masai Ujiri was the mastermind behind the building of the Raptors\u2019 championship roster and some key player decisions lie ahead this summer. First and foremost is that of Finals MVP and star forward Kawhi Leonard. He is reportedly declining his option for 2019-20 and will enter free agency with plenty of suitors in tow. Aside from Leonard, swingman Danny Green (an unrestricted free agent) and center Marc Gasol (who has a player option) are among the names Toronto must make decisions on, too. Ujiri met with the media in Toronto on Tuesday and said Leonard is the top free-agent priority for the Raptors, but he isn\u2019t about to overlook Toronto\u2019s other players from the 2019 title run. He also plans to meet with Pascal Siakam\u2019s agent this summer to discuss a potential contract extension. Veteran swingman Vince Carter spent the first 6 1\/2 seasons of his career with Toronto (1998-2004) and he and the team have mended fences after a bitter split between them years ago. Carter, who just completed his 20th season, is an unrestricted free agent this summer and Ujiri did not rule out Monday a potential place for Carter with the franchise. Ujiri also commented on his future with the Raptors, as talk of him pursuing a front-office job with the Washington Wizards bubbled up shortly after the Finals clincher. In short, he sees himself staying in Toronto as long as they will have him. \u2014 12:12 p.m. The Utah Jazz pulled off the most recent super-trade of the summer, reaching a reported agreement with the Memphis Grizzlies for star point guard Mike Conley . That trade isn\u2019t expected to be officially given the NBA\u2019s OK until July 6. While Conley isn\u2019t officially a member of the Jazz (yet), he has apparently gotten in a workout with Utah\u2019s other star guard, Donovan Mitchell. Thanks to video from Twitter users @ChrisJHoops (Chris Johnson) and @swishcultures, Jazz fans got an early look at their new backcourt. (And as eagle-eyed observers will note, he\u2019s also wearing a Jazz \u201cnote\u201d-style logo t-shirt during the workout, too.) If you missed it at last night\u2019s NBA Awards red carpet show, Conley also talked about the pending deal to Utah and how he learned about it\u2026 \u2014 11:25 a.m. Free agency doesn\u2019t officially open until 6 p.m. on July 30, but the day beforehand, teams can begin scheduling meetings with free agents starting at 6 p.m. The Golden State Warriors have two of the prime free-agent targets of the summer on their roster and won\u2019t be wasting time getting a meeting in with them. Warriors GM Bob Myers told reporters on Monday that the team plans to schedule meetings with forward Kevin Durant and guard Klay Thompson. Per The Mercury News , the Warriors have held to Durant\u2019s wishes to not have recruiting tactics, such as putting up billboards in the Bay Area. As for Thompson, The Mercury News reports he is expected to agree to a deal provided it is a five-year, $190 million one the Warriors have said they will offer. When asked Monday of his level of optimism in keeping both players with Golden State, Myers simply shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Coach Steve Kerr recently told ESPN\u2019s Nick Friedell that there will be no formal recruiting pitch to either player. \u201cThere\u2019s no recruiting,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing any videos and tours of the city. Basically it\u2019s a \u2018We want you back and we hope you decide to come back and see what happens,\u2019 but we\u2019re at a different place now,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut any time you\u2019re trying to retain your own players, I think the song and dance, the pomp and circumstance is unnecessary and I actually think it\u2019s unnecessary even for other players. You just got to do what you got to do, but with our group it\u2019s just \u2014 conversation.\u201d \u2014 11:02 a.m. As difficult as the 2018-19 season was for the Washington Wizards at large, it was a solid one individually for guard Bradley Beal. He posted career highs in scoring (25.6 points per game), rebounding (5.0 per game), assists (5.5 per game), steals (1.5 per game) and minutes played (3,028). Washington, however, was not as successful as injuries to John Wall, Dwight Howard and others left the team with a 32-50 record . Beal was in Santa Monica, Calif., last night for the 2019 NBA Awards, where he claimed the NBA Cares Community Assist award . He just missed out on qualifying for a supermax contract extension after not making one of the 2019 All-NBA teams . Beal told The Washington Post last night he was \u201cdefinitely\u201d open to discussing a contract extension with the team . After such a rough season overall, trade rumors swirled about the Wizards and Beal\u2019s name came up in some rumors. Beal said Monday that he has been assured by Washington\u2019s owner (Ted Leonsis), its interim GM (Tommy Sheppard) and his coach (Scott Brooks) that he will not be traded. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very transparent and that\u2019s been great,\u201d Beal told The Washington Post . \u201cThey\u2019re not keeping me in the dark about anything, even about the trade rumors. \u2026 It\u2019s great having that peace of mind.\u201d \u2014 10:42 a.m. Over the last 12 years, the Houston Rockets have proven they are not a team to stand pat under general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s watch. After falling short of their stated dream \u2014 a trip to The Finals \u2014 for a second straight season, Morey doesn\u2019t think his team is about to fall back in the Western Conference. Quite the contrary, actually. Morey spoke at the 2019 NBA Awards last night in Santa Monica, Calif., and made it clear he still believes his team is among the best of the best in the NBA. Per Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle , Morey sounded confident that not only would his core players from last season be back come 2019-20, but more talent could join their mix . Aside from that, Morey also shot down talk of a rift between star guards James Harden and Chris Paul, with Paul reportedly wanting out of Houston . Paul told the Houston Chronicle on Sunday he is \u201cvery happy\u201d to know he will be back with the team next season. Morey added Monday that he had recently spoken with Paul about next season and playing for the Rockets. \u2014 10:30 a.m. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker | Offseason Trades | 2019 Draft"},{"id":33046,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-jeanie-buss-magic-exit-backs-pelinka","date":"2019-06-25","title":"Lakers' Jeanie Buss backs Rob Pelinka, chimes in on Magic Johnson's exit","content":" The NBA offseason has been one of twists and turns for the Los Angeles Lakers ever since Magic Johnson stepped down as team president at season\u2019s end.

While all of this has been going on, Lakers governor and controlling owner Jeanie Buss has been silent on the events surrounding the franchise.

She said her relationship with Johnson will \u201cbe fine\u201d and backed the work Pelinka has done since coming aboard in the spring of 2017. \u201cI\u2019ve always had confidence in Rob, whatever the speculation is out there,\u201d Buss said, per Tania Ganguli of the Los Angeles Times . \u201cWe don\u2019t need outside media to validate the things that we do. I\u2019m very happy and I think we\u2019re on the right path.\u201d As to why she hadn\u2019t spoken up on the matter of Johnson\u2019s resignation and subsequent accusations against Pelinka, Buss said: \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t anything to say,\u201d Buss said, per ESPN\u2019s Ohm Youngmisuk . \u201cI think that when Magic decided that he didn\u2019t want to be with the organization any longer in an official capacity, that took me off guard. So I needed time to figure out what the process was going to be. That\u2019s all. Just taking care of business and looking out after the organization.\u201d \u201cIt was a surprise when Magic turned in his resignation. I didn\u2019t see that coming. But everything else has been pretty much as any organization moves forward and changes going into a new season. So as much as has been speculated as to what the Lakers are doing, to me, we are in a really good place and we are following our path, and our plan, going into the next season.\u201d The Lakers hired Frank Vogel as the team\u2019s new coach on May 20, the same day in which Johnson went on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d and lobbed his claims against Pelinka. That day, Pelinka said Johnson\u2019s words were \u201csurprising to hear and disheartening. \u2026 They\u2019re just simply not true.\u201d In Johnson\u2019s absence, the Lakers were elevating Pelinka to the Lakers\u2019 lead basketball executive. \u201cI have 100% confidence in him in running his basketball operations,\u201d Buss said, per the Los Angeles Times . \u201cHe\u2019s brought us a great new head coach in Frank Vogel, whose teams have had a lot of success in the playoffs and who have played consistently ranking high in defense, which means not only does he emphasize defense but the players buy into his defensive schemes.\u201d Los Angeles has been active in the offseason already, reaching a reported trade with the New Orleans Pelicans that will net the Lakers superstar big man Anthony Davis. In exchange, the Lakers will reportedly send guard Lonzo Ball, guard Josh Hart and forward Brandon Ingram to the Pelicans. Buss was at the awards to support Johnson receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award and to support former Lakers star Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who was serving as emcee of the event. When asked by ESPN about Johnson\u2019s comments about Pelinka betraying him, Buss said: \u201cI can\u2019t really anticipate what he thinks. He has to answer those questions. He\u2019s always full of surprises. Like as surprising as it was, it kind of reminded me of back in 1981 when he asked to be traded after winning a championship with the Lakers because he wasn\u2019t happy with the way the offense had changed. And that led us to getting Pat Riley as our head coach. \u201cSo he\u2019s got good instincts. He\u2019s got to stay true to who he is and do what is right for him. I wish I would\u2019ve had a little bit more notice, but I think we are going to be just fine.\u201d Once the Davis trade is officially consummated, the Lakers will have plenty of work to do to round out a roster chock full of vacancies and needs. Buss knows that getting back to the top remains priority No. 1 for her and her team. \u201cThere\u2019s the gold standard, and then there\u2019s the purple-and-gold standard,\u201d Buss said, per ESPN. \u201cCertainly, we are going to do everything we can to get the best players possible and to get the Lakers back to consistently be at that level. But we got a ways to go, and I think we are [heading] in the right direction, but at the end of the day, we will be judged by our wins and losses. \u201cThe goal has always been to get back into the playoffs.\u201d"},{"id":33009,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-acquire-evan-turner-official-release","date":"2019-06-24","title":"Hawks acquire Evan Turner from Portland in exchange for Kent Bazemore","content":"ATLANTA  \u2014 The Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club acquired guard\/forward Evan Turner from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for guard Kent Bazemore, it was announced Monday. \u201cWe are happy to add Evan to our team, a veteran who we believe can help our club,\u201d said Hawks General Manager and Head of Basketball Operations Travis Schlenk. \u201cThe versatility he has shown throughout his career will be valuable for us this season.\u201d In nine seasons with Philadelphia, Indiana, Boston and Portland, Turner has averaged 9.9 points, 4.7 rebounds and 3.5 assists in 27.2 minutes (.435 FG%, .781 FT%).

Building around LeBron James, Anthony Davis","content":"The Los Angeles Lakers have LeBron James and a reported deal in place to acquire Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans. In the quest for a 17th championship, two of the best players in the league is a great start. But, with free agency  set to begin at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, there remains a lot of work to be done in regard to the rest of the Lakers\u2019 roster, which will be left pretty barren in the wake of the Davis trade. Here are the details, according to multiple reports\u2026 Lakers receive: Anthony Davis Pelicans receive: Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, the No. 4 pick (De\u2019Andre Hunter, later sent to Atlanta), the Lakers\u2019 first-round pick in 2021 (top-8 protected), the right to swap picks in 2023, and the Lakers\u2019 first-round pick in 2024 (that New Orleans can defer to 2025). On July 1, the Lakers will have eight players under contract. Three of those eight will be sent to New Orleans and three of the five remaining \u2014 Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones and Mo Wagner \u2014 have a total of 709 minutes of NBA experience . That leaves a lot for the Lakers to consider going forward \u2026 The Lakers would have more cap space before the trade than they would after it, because Davis\u2019 salary is far greater than the combined salaries of Ball, Hart and Ingram. But if they fill all or most of that extra cap space (by signing free agents) before the trade is officially made (and wind up over the salary cap after the trade), they would need to include the salary of the No. 4 pick in the deal (so the outgoing salary comes close enough to matching that of Davis). In order to do that, they would have to wait 30 days after Hunter is signed to his rookie contract. They could do it before Hunter is signed if they expanded the deal to include the contracts of Bonga, Jones and Wagner. And they would likely need an additional team (or teams) to take on those contracts. If they can\u2019t delay the trade or find takers for those contracts, they could make the trade as is, but they wouldn\u2019t have the cap space needed (about $33 million) to offer a max contract to a free agent with seven to nine years of experience (like Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Khris Middleton, Klay Thompson, Nikola Vucevic or Kemba Walker). Of course, when talking about the Lakers\u2019 cap space, we can\u2019t forget that $5 million of it is being taken up (for each of the next three seasons) by the stretched contract of Luol Deng (who they signed in that disastrous summer of 2016 ). Should they not delay the trade or find takers for those three extra contracts, that $5 million is the difference between the space they need to sign one of the above players to the max and what they\u2019ll actually have (about $28 million if they get Davis to waive his trade kicker, which he may not do anyway).  James and Davis appear to be an ideal fit. James is one of the best playmakers in NBA history, while Davis is one of the best finishers in the league. He\u2019s one of three players (and James is one of the other two) who have shot better than 70 percent on at least 2,000 attempts in the restricted area over the last five years. Davis has been assisted on about two-thirds of his field goals over his career . James, meanwhile, ranks fourth with 8.8 assists per game over the last three seasons. But Davis is a different kind of offensive star than James has typically teamed with, in that he\u2019s more of an interior scorer than a perimeter one. Over the last three seasons, only 40 percent of James\u2019 assists \u2014 which is the 59th highest rate among 106 players with 500 total assists \u2014 have been on shots in the restricted area. Still, over those three years, James\u2019 teammates have shot better in the restricted area with him on the floor (64.3 percent) than they have with him off it (61.4 percent). Last season, Davis scored just 1.02 points per possession as a roll man, according to Synergy play-type tracking. That ranked 19th among 22 players who averaged at least three roll man possessions per game and was down from 1.18 (fourth among players with three per game) in 2017-18. James should help Davis achieve maximum efficiency as a roll man. But \u201croll man\u201d possessions include pick-and-pop jumpers, and Davis hasn\u2019t shot as well from outside the paint over the last two seasons (35.2 percent) as he did over the previous three (41.1 percent). He\u2019s made up for that drop somewhat by increasing his 3-point rate, but this season, he still took 1.6 times as many mid-range shots as 3-pointers. Though that was the lowest rate of his career, it was the seventh highest rate among 218 players who took at least 200 shots from outside the paint. (Only 23 of those 218 players took more mid-range shots than 3-pointers.) Davis\u2019 effective field goal percentage from outside the paint (40.9 percent) ranked 209th among those 218 players. James\u2019 (48.1 percent) ranked 137th. So, while one is an elite passer and both are elite finishers, they\u2019re not a perfect fit in regard to scoring inside and out.  Wagner might remain as a back-up big, but the Lakers\u2019 post-trade depth chart doesn\u2019t go beyond Davis, James and Kyle Kuzma. (About Kuzma: His effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint \u2014 44.5 percent \u2014 ranked 187th among those 218 players with at least 200 field goal attempts.) That\u2019s a terrific and versatile frontline, but the Lakers have no depth and no backcourt whatsoever. Reggie Bullock, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo and Lance Stephenson are all unrestricted free agents, none of whom appear to be obvious candidates to return. Whether or not the Lakers can get rid of those three smaller contracts, they might be better off spreading their remaining cap space around (rather than using it on a third star). With James and Davis, they need to add as much shooting as possible. In James\u2019 first season in L.A., the Lakers (33.6 percent) ranked last in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage , with Kuzma having the third-worst mark (31.7 percent) among 101 players with at least 200 attempts. The good news? Six of the top nine catch-and-shoot 3-point shooters (minimum 100 attempts) from last season are free agents. Additionally, 20 free agents this summer shot 40 percent or better on at least 100 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts. Four of those 20 are Irving, Leonard, Thompson and Kevin Durant, but the Lakers should find some realistic targets among the remaining 16.  Last year\u2019s strategy of putting playmakers (instead of shooters) around James didn\u2019t work. The 2018-19 Lakers were the lowest ranked offensive team \u2014 they ranked 24th at 107.4 points scored per 100 possessions \u2014 that James has played for in his 16 seasons. (The 109.0 points per 100 possessions they scored in the 55 games that James played in would have ranked 19th, which would have been the second-lowest that any James team has ranked.) That doesn\u2019t mean that next season\u2019s Lakers don\u2019t need some playmaking beyond James, who will be 35 years old in December. Taking some of the offensive burden off his shoulders would allow him to (maybe?) exert more energy on defense. If the Lakers are looking for both shooting and playmaking, the most interesting option would be D\u2019Angelo Russell (whom the Lakers traded to the Brooklyn Nets two years ago ). Russell shot 39.4 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts last season and also had the most assists (563) among free agents. Russell is a restricted free agent, but if the Nets choose to upgrade to Irving ( as has been widely reported ) at point guard, they may let Russell walk. And he probably won\u2019t command a maximum starting salary (about $27.3 million for a player with 0-6 years of experience). Brogdon would be another dual-threat guard, though also a restricted free agent and likely tougher to pry away from the Milwaukee Bucks. Unrestricted options could include Patrick Beverley and Darren Collison.  Beverley, Brogdon or Collison would help make up for the loss of Ball on defense. The Lakers ranked a respectable 13th in defensive efficiency last season. But they were seventh (106.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) at the time of Ball\u2019s season-ending injury and ranked 22nd (112.4) thereafter. They allowed 102.7 per 100 with James and Ball on the floor together, but 107.9 per 100 with James on the floor without Ball. (He will now team with Jrue Holiday in what may be the league\u2019s best defensive backcourt.) Davis ranked low in high-volume rim protection rankings , with opponents shooting 63.9 percent at the rim when he was there to protect it. But with his length and athleticism, he should be able to make up for James\u2019 defensive issues more than any guard. Last season, Davis averaged 1.69 steals + blocks per personal foul. That was down from 1.94 the season prior, but was still the highest rate among players that played at least 1,000 minutes. He was one of two players (the Indiana Pacers\u2019 Myles Turner was the other) that played at least 1,000 minutes and had more blocks (135) than fouls (132). The Lakers will still need perimeter defenders. Even if they get a point guard like Beverley or Collison, they\u2019ll need someone to defend opposing stars. There are 17 free agents who defended the league\u2019s five leading wing scorers last season (James Harden, Paul George, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker and Leonard) for at least 150 total possessions: * Possessions defending Antetokounmpo account for more than 85 percent of their total. Four of those guys \u2014 Butler, Durant, Middleton and Thompson \u2014 are players that the Lakers probably can\u2019t afford. Bullock and Caldwell-Pope are the Lakers\u2019 own free agents. Barnes, Green and Matthews are also on the catch-and-shoot list above. In regard to filling out the roster (and filling cap space), the Lakers aren\u2019t limited to just free agency. They could also make trades beyond the deal with New Orleans. Alas, with all the draft picks and young players they\u2019re sending out for Davis, they\u2019re pretty limited in what they can offer other teams in exchange for useful players. Acquiring Davis was obviously a big step toward contention. But the trade will leave the Lakers with a difficult path toward surrounding their two stars with a capable supporting cast. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

While it has grown in popularity with the introduction of a pro league in 2005, basketball still lags far behind baseball and soccer in Japan. Hachimura\u2019s NBA career is sure to help the sport grow in leaps and bounds. The son of a Japanese mother and father from the Republic of Benin, Hachimura is the latest Japanese of mixed race to make a splash in the sporting world following the likes of Naomi Osaka and Yu Darvish. \u201cThis is a huge step forward for Japan,\u201d said Keisuke Tsutsumi, an office worker who follows the NBA. \u201cIt will take the sport to a new level here.\u201d Hachimura\u2019s junior high school coach Joji Sakamoto welcomed the news of his draft selection.

To put it on for our country, that means a lot.\u201d France had five players selected in 2016. \u201cTo see players come out of (Canada) and be very good is something that\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Clarke, who went 21st to the Oklahoma City Thunder. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who grew up watching (Steve) Nash play and I always thought it was really cool he was from Canada.\u201d The players selected \u2013 four in the first round \u2013 join the 13 active Canadian players in the NBA. Among them include former No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins, NBA champion Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyler Ennis. \u201cI know guys like Andrew Wiggins and Tyler Ennis gave me hope,\u201d said Alexander-Walker, the 17th pick by the New Orleans Pelicans. \u201cNow as RJ got selected. I got selected. Hopefully more Canadians who get selected can kind of give those kids and other generations hope.\u201d Clarke, who played at Gonzaga, said the Raptors\u2019 championship will help the growth of basketball in Canada. \u201cBasketball is getting bigger and bigger and it\u2019s gotten much bigger, too, in Canada,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been really fun to watch the evolution of basketball in the country.\u201d Former Canadian players include 2018 Hall of Fame inductee Nash \u2013 who is Barrett\u2019s godfather \u2013 former No. 1 pick Anthony Bennett and three-time NBA champion Rick Fox. The previous record for the most Canadians chosen in a single draft was in 2014, when four were picked. From 1983-2009, a total of just nine were selected. \u201cIt feels great,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cCanadian basketball is really on the rise.\u201d"},{"id":33040,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-hassan-whiteside-opting-heat","date":"2019-06-21","title":"Report: Whiteside opts in for $27 million with Heat","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Hassan Whiteside is not leaving the final year of his Miami Heat deal on the table. A person with knowledge of the situation said Friday that Whiteside is exercising his $27.1 million option for next season in Miami. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the Heat nor Whiteside announced the decision publicly. The move was not a surprise. It\u2019ll be the final year of Whiteside\u2019s four-year, $98 million contract with the Miami, and the salary he\u2019ll command next season will keep him as the highest-paid player on the Heat roster. Whiteside averaged 12.3 points and a team-best 11.3 rebounds last season, appearing in 72 games and starting 53 of those. He also averaged only 23 minutes per game, and at times expressed his displeasure about not having a larger role. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come to training camp like everybody else this year and earn it,\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said Friday, several hours before the option was exercised. For his career, Whiteside has averaged 13.4 points and 11.4 rebounds over parts of seven seasons with Miami and Sacramento. He led the NBA in blocks per game in the 2015-16 season, then led the league in rebounds per game the following season. He\u2019s third on Miami\u2019s all-time blocks list behind Alonzo Mourning and Dwyane Wade, and fifth on the team\u2019s all-time rebound list behind Udonis Haslem, Mourning, Rony Seikaly and Wade."},{"id":46445,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-nba-summer-league-schedule-official-release","date":"2019-06-21","title":"2019 NBA Summer League schedules released","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 The matchup between New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson and New York Knicks guard-forward RJ Barrett \u2013 two of the top three picks in NBA Draft 2019 presented by State Farm \u2013 highlights the 11-day, 83-game schedule for MGM Resorts NBA Summer League 2019 in Las Vegas.

game","content":" Few, if any, NBA players are as high on the mountain as Kawhi Leonard is right now. The reigning Finals MVP and Raptors star is a living legend in Toronto and if he had any doubts about his status as such, it was confirmed last night. Leonard took in the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 home game against the Los Angeles Angels, arriving to the game in the top of the fourth inning. He and his girlfriend, Kishele Shipley, took their front-row seats beside the Blue Jays\u2019 dugout. As they were walking to their spot, the crowd serenaded Leonard with an \u201cM-V-P\u201d chant and gave him a standing ovation.  He was also shown on the stadium\u2019s big screen and received another ovation, with Leonard raising his finger in a No. 1 gesture to the crowd. Angels slugger Mike Trout came up to bat while Leonard was in his seat and he took out his phone to snap a few photos of the MLB superstar. Per The Associated Press, Leonard was caught yawning after a week of celebrating the Raptors\u2019 NBA title and left in the bottom of the seventh inning. Blue Jays starting pitcher Clayton Richard told The Associated Press he had a bit of a different take on the commotion that came about when Leonard arrived. \u201cI got 0-and-2 on (Kole) Calhoun, and I thought, man,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI know I hadn\u2019t been 0-2 on a lot of hitters, but they really got excited for that one.\u201d (And for the record, the Blue Jays beat the Angels , 7-5.)"},{"id":33087,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oladipo-likely-out-until-december-or-january","date":"2019-06-21","title":"Victor Oladipo could be out until December or January","content":" In late January, Indiana Pacers star guard Victor Oladipo was lost for the season when he ruptured a quadriceps tendon in his right knee . While he has made progress with his injury rehabilitation, it seems unlikely he will suit up at the start of the 2019-20 campaign. Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard told reporters on Friday that Oladipo could not be back in the lineup until the winter, writes Matthew VanTryon of the Indianapolis Star . \u201cHe might be out a little bit,\u201d Pritchard said of Oladipo on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful he\u2019ll be back December or January.\u201d Roughly eight weeks after his injury and subsequent surgery, Oladipo posted videos on social media of himself walking the hallway of his doctor\u2019s office in Miami. After having his surgery, Oladipo faced an uncertain timetable ahead for his return to the court. The 2019 All-Star guard spoke with the media on a conference call in early February and was taking a day-by-day approach to his recovery. \u201cAt the end of the day I\u2019m a positive butterfly,\u201d Oladipo said on Feb. 11 . \u201cI\u2019m not looking too far into the future and I\u2019m not looking at the past; just focused on today and trying to get better every day.\u201d In May, Pritchard said he was unsure of when Oladipo would return, telling the Indianapolis Star : \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to say, \u2018Well, we know he\u2019s going to be back. He\u2019ll be back at this time.\u2019 Because the truth is the body heals at a different rate for every person.\u201d Oladipo told the newspaper in May : \u201cI know my body more better than ever than now going through this rehab process. It\u2019s like relearning my body. I\u2019ll know what to do what not to do, not to overdo it.\u201d He was injured during the second quarter of a Jan. 23 game vs. the Toronto Raptors as he was racing back to defend a transition break. He collapsed as he closed on the Raptors\u2019 Pascal Siakam. Oladipo averaged 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 31.9 minutes per game last season. At the time of his injury, he ranked third in the NBA in clutch points with 5.1 ppg , was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 3 (Oct. 29-Nov. 4) and was an All-Star last season. The Pacers went 16-19 after Oladipo\u2019s injury and finished as the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference. Indiana was swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Boston Celtics.

Players were teammates, then opponents, or vice versa in the span of several picks. De\u2019Andre Hunter, wearing a Lakers cap even as he was reportedly headed to Atlanta via New Orleans , was asked a question about Jaxson Hayes, drafted by the Hawks but headed to the Pelicans. It took Virginia teammate Kyle Guy texting Hunter to reveal news of the possible move, by the only team for whom Hunter had worked out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were going to trade up to the fourth pick,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI know there were trying to do something to get earlier in the draft. It shows that they believe in me. They have a plan for me as well. They think I\u2019m a great player. I\u2019m just trying to help the franchise any way I can.\u201d The reported deal sending Hunter to Atlanta represents a flip-flop in concept for Hawks GM Travis Schlenk, who last year sent No. 3 Luka Doncic to Dallas for No. 5 Trae Young and a future first-round pick, which converted into this year\u2019s No. 10 selection. This time, it was a move four picks up, with the expected package including the No. 8 pick (Hayes), the Nets\u2019 No. 17 pick (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) \u2014 along with the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 Allen Crabbe \u2014 and the No. 35 (Marcos Louzada Silva). Young broke out over the second half of his rookie campaign with pinpoint passing and long-range shooting, pushing Luka Doncic in what\u2019s expected to be a razor-thin Kia Rookie of the Year race. Second-year forward John Collins boosted his averages to 19.5 points and 9.8 rebounds by season\u2019s end, his high-wire inside act complemented by the outside shooting of All-Rookie Second Team forward Kevin Huerter (9.7 ppg, 38.5 percent on 385 3-point attempts). And they\u2019ll be joined by Duke swingman Cam Reddish, who dropped into their laps at No. 10 after being projected as high as fifth leading into the Draft. \u201cI think we won today,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cWe just feel really good about getting Cam. He\u2019s a guy that we went into the Draft hoping we could get and to have him be there still at 10 is really exciting.\u201d The Hawks\u2019 players were amped about the additions, with Young welcoming Reddish to the \u201cfam\u201d on Twitter, ready to put in work for the upcoming campaign. Huerter, in a Draft live show for Stadium, said he loved the Hunter pick , citing the defensive standout\u2019s versatility and winning profile at NCAA champion Virginia. Reddish praised his new teammates as a \u201cyoung, talented group\u201d and believes playing alongside Young will make for a clean fit. \u201cI think he can do it all on the court,\u201d Reddish said. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s a tremendous passer, will be able to find me throughout the game. I\u2019m looking forward to learning from him, being around him, soaking it all in.\u201d And while the Hawks were building on an established core, the Memphis Grizzlies \u2013 holders of the No. 2 pick \u2013 stacked further chips on a retooling now in full force following Wednesday\u2019s reported trade of Mike Conley to the Utah Jazz . Ja Morant had long been projected at No. 2 due to his elite athleticism and uncanny vision; he was the first NCAA player to average 20 points and 10 assists since colleges began tracking assists in 1982-83. And Conley\u2019s expected exit clears the lane for Morant to establish a long-running partnership with 2018 No. 4 selection Jaren Jackson Jr., who earned All-Rookie First Team honors despite being limited to 58 games. \u201cI have some big shoes to fill in Mike Conley,\u201d Morant acknowledged. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player. I wish him the best. It just means the Grizzlies see a lot in me. It\u2019s been crazy. Obviously a wild moment.\u201d They followed the expected Morant selection by reportedly flipping Utah\u2019s No. 23 pick (from the reported Conley exchange) to Oklahoma City to select Gonzaga\u2019s Brandon Clarke at No. 21. Clarke, an unexpected presence outside the lottery, could provide yet another high-flying, high-motor addition to the Grizzlies\u2019 budding core. The potential for a swarming defense and destructive transition force is in place. \u201cJa is a really, really good passer,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAnd Jaren is just a really good talent, too, a really strong dude who can shoot it and also drive it. It\u2019s always fun playing with dudes like that. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have some very fun highlights to watch.\u201d And yet, Clarke is officially with the Thunder until further notice, a not-quite Memphis blue flat brim above his brow in interviews. An already-dated souvenir, for someone.

Some players will rise. Others will fall. \u201cBust\u201d and \u201csleeper\u201d tags will be dispersed accordingly. This team or GM will be lauded for an especially savvy selection, that one will be razzed for the quality player or players on whom it whiffed. But the through line of the dreams-come-true event Thursday night at Barclays Center, the lone selection that will not or at least should not change, is Zion Williamson . Williamson is the sure thing, the \u201ccan\u2019t miss,\u201d consensus No. 1 pick bound for the New Orleans Pelicans. He\u2019s a 6-foot-7, 285-pound freshman from Duke whose comps aren\u2019t merely established players currently in the NBA but some of the game\u2019s legends. So think Blake Griffin, sure. But also think LeBron James. And Charles Barkley. And, for that matter, every other wide-body who\u2019s ever played with muscles on muscles, above-the-rim explosiveness, balletic body control and an instantly recognizable game that\u2019s as charismatic as it is freakish. Yeah, awfully small subset. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to playing against everybody,\u201d Williamson said soon after his selection. \u201cI want to be the best. I feel I have to earn everybody\u2019s respect.\u201d It\u2019s not just a matter of Williamson\u2019s game tickling NBA fans\u2019 fancy, either. He managed, in almost his first official pro moment, to capture a lot of their hearts too. No sooner had Williamson \u2013 the first No. 1 pick to be born in this millennium (July 6, 2000) \u2013 strode to the stage in his cream-white suit, tugged on a Pelicans draft cap and embraced NBA commissioner Adam Silver, he dropped his guard to let the world share his emotions in the moment. His status as college basketball\u2019s best and his draft position had been established months ago. There was no new mystery as to when his name would be called by Silver at the podium. And yet, when the first ESPN microphone was poked in front of him, with his mother Sharonda Sampson at his side, the big guy lost it. He choked up and blinked back tears, not quite winning that battle. \u201cMy mom sacrificed a lot for me,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without my mom. She did everything for me. I just want to thank her.\u201d Several interviews and maybe 20 minutes later, Williamson explained how the horribly kept secret of his No. 1 selection could trigger his response. \u201cBecause I love the game of basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hear people say things like, \u2018Oh, it was likely I was going to go No. 1.\u2019 But I guess you don\u2019t know until you actually go through it.\u201d What mattered most to Williamson about his mother\u2019s role in his life? \u201cTough love,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always be the first one to keep it real with me. \u2026 She put aside her dreams just so me and my brothers could have a chance at ours.\u201d The love already heading Williamson\u2019s way in New Orleans was less tough and more unconditional at this stage, for the teenager represents a re-birth for a Pelicans franchise rocked by the loss of All-Star forward Anthony Davis. Davis, coincidentally, was the No. 1 pick in 2012 and generally considered the top prospect to hit the Draft before Williamson. But after six-and-a-half seasons and only two trips to the playoffs, Davis asked in December to be traded, despite having more than two-plus seasons left on his contract. David Griffin, the Pelicans\u2019 new vice president of basketball operations, had hoped that Williamson\u2019s arrival might convince Davis to stay. When that didn\u2019t happen, Griffin swiftly shifted to Plan B, arranging to trade the discontented big man to the Los Angeles Lakers in a deal that won\u2019t be official until July. Now New Orleans, which has won just two playoff series in its 17 seasons and failed to qualify 10 times, has a new cornerstone. Williamson figures to be under team control contractually for as long or longer than Davis stuck around, with teammates relocated from L.A. such as Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart to run with him and Pelicans holdovers. \u201cWhat excites me the most is the fact that they\u2019re young and they\u2019re close to my age,\u201d said Duke\u2019s third No. 1 overall pick (Elton Brand in 1999, Kyrie Irving in 2011). \u201cSo they can help me a lot more, like how to deal with this transition. I think we can build something over there.\u201d The essential block is Williamson, who swept college basketball\u2019s major awards with a game that strains credulity. At 285 pounds, his listed weight is greater than almost every big man in the NBA, but he has quick-twitch speed and thrives in the open court. He can stare down into the rim before slamming home dunks with unnerving ferocity, and he is a deft and willing passer. Williamson averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 30 minutes for the Blue Devils, while making 68 percent of his shots. He and fellow Top 10 picks R.J. Barrett (New York, No. 3) and Cam Reddish (Atlanta, No. 10) helped Duke reach the Elite Eight, with Williamson earning ACC Tournament MVP along the way. He\u2019s not a perfect player \u2013 his jump shot and range need work \u2013 but he already is working to complement his transition and low-post repertoire. Defensively, Williamson has the motor and mobility to switch assignments and quick hands to dislodge the ball without fouling. As a rebounder, his verticality is matched by, well, his horizontality in controlling the air space above and around him. \u201cHis size, his athleticism, his power is visible,\u201d former St. John\u2019s coach and Naismith Hall of Famer Chris Mullin said. \u201cBut to me his speed is really incredible from end to end. \u201cI would morph Charles Barkley and Shawn Kemp and put them together [as a comparison]. When he gets to the NBA and he plays with that extra space they have in the wide key, he\u2019s going to be a monster.\u201d Williamson arrives with hype \u2013 no, make that expectations, because of all he\u2019s shown already on courts around America \u2013 that rival what James shouldered when he arrived from high school in 2003. His plan for lugging that responsibility: \u201cWhatever the team needs me to do, I\u2019m willing to do it, because I feel people remember winners.\u201d The selections immediately after Williamson were nearly as predictable, based on intelligence and mock drafts that solidified in the days before the Draft. Murry State guard Ja Morant was chosen by Memphis at No. 2, and Barrett\u2019s ensuing selection by the Knicks delighted their always boisterous fans in the stands at Barclay. The order of the next four choices was jumbled from some predictions. Yet by the time the smoke cleared, sure enough, the seven players projected to come off the board soonest had slotted into the night\u2019s top seven spots. That included Virginia forward De\u2019andre Hunter to Atlanta at No. 4 (via the Lakers, in the aforementioned Davis trade that has yet to be completed), Vanderbilt point guard Darius Garland to Cleveland at No. 5, Texas Tech wing Jarrett Culver to Minnesota at No. 6 and North Carolina guard Coby White to Chicago at No. 7. Just because there wasn\u2019t a lot of suspense at Barclays didn\u2019t mean there was no intrigue. Much of that came from unusually heavy trade action \u2013 all technically unofficial \u2013 that had teams moving up, down and all around to snag picks, dump picks or clean up their salary-cap positions in anticipation of free agency that starts June 30. The timing of the Draft, relative to when the NBA\u2019s new business year begins, had players donning caps of teams they\u2019ll never play for, while speaking guardedly about those for whom they really were picked. A reported nine trades impacted draft decisions made in the first round alone. There even was a moment when Morant, in his post-Draft media session, gave a shout-out to veteran Grizzlies guard Mike Conley, whose spot he\u2019ll presumably be taking once Conley\u2019s trade to Utah officially goes through. But there\u2019s no such uncertainty about Williamson, the through line of this year\u2019s class, the true line in his heartfelt reactions Thursday and broad-shouldered hope of a Big Easy franchise in need. Williamson showed his grasp of the NBA\u2019s and sports\u2019 need for fresh icons, in effect accepting his status as a legend in waiting.  \u201cYou know, times change,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why there are so many debates about who people think the greatest players of all time are. If you were in the time of Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, you\u2019d probably say one of those two. If you were in the time of Jordan, you\u2019d say Jordan. In our generation, a lot of them say LeBron. \u201cSo times changes and I think younger fans like younger players.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be young, though, to have your eye on Zion. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Lottery picks De\u2019Andre Hunter, Jarrett Culver and Jaxson Hayes didn\u2019t last long with the teams that picked them Thursday night. Hunter was taken fourth by the Los Angeles Lakers in a pick they had already agreed to trade to the New Orleans Pelicans to acquire Anthony Davis. That deal can\u2019t officially go through until July 6. The Pelicans didn\u2019t hold on to the pick, agreeing to trade it earlier Thursday to the Atlanta Hawks and acquiring Hayes, who was selected eighth. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were going to trade up to the fourth pick,\u201d Hunter said of the Hawks. \u201cI know they were trying to do something to get earlier in the draft.\u201d The move wasn\u2019t a huge surprise as the Virginia star only worked out for the Hawks. The Pelicans also received Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who was taken 17th, Marcos Louzada Silva, along with a protected first-round pick from Cleveland in 2020 that Atlanta had. New Orleans also sent Solomon Hill, Jordan Bone and a future second-rounder to Atlanta. The trade was confirmed by a person familiar with the deal. The trade helped the Pelicans create more salary cap space by unloading the nearly $12.8 million owed to Hill next season. New Orleans also saved about $2.2 million by moving their second first-round pick down from fourth to eighth overall. Hunter wasn\u2019t sure what he would do with the Lakers hat he wore onto the stage to shake hands with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily know what I\u2019m going to do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably give it to a Lakers fan. Have them wear it.\u201d The Hawks and Pelicans weren\u2019t the only teams making moves in the lottery. Culver was selected by Phoenix with the sixth pick and the Suns agreed to trade him to the Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of different. I\u2019m just happy to be in the NBA and have this opportunity. It\u2019s a lot of work to be done,\u201d Culver said. \u201cSo wherever I end up, I\u2019ve got to stay true to myself and give whatever team I\u2019m playing for everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d The Wolves traded Dario Saric and Cameron Johnson, who was drafted 11th.

Draft night proved otherwise. Williamson was the No. 1 pick of the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2019 NBA Draft \u2014 a surprise to nobody who watched basketball this past season. But afterward he couldn\u2019t hide his emotions, even though he along with everyone else knew what would happen Thursday night. \u201cBecause I love the game of basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hear people say things like, \u2018Oh, that it was likely I was going to go No. 1.\u2019 But I guess you don\u2019t know until you actually go through it. Hearing my name called and I was able to make it on stage without a tear, shake the commissioner\u2019s hand, but in the interview my mom was standing beside me, and my emotions just took over.\u201d There might be tears of joy in New Orleans, too, after the Pelicans were able to get the Duke powerhouse who is considered one of the most exciting prospects in years. The 6-foot-7, 285-pounder compiled a college career worth of highlights into just one season, becoming the third freshman to be voted player of the year by The Associated Press . His assault on the rims made him a favorite of college basketball fans, but his game is more than just dunks. Williamson averaged 22.6 points and 8.9 rebounds while shooting 68% from the field. Wearing a white suit, he hugged members of his family and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after his name was called first at Barclays Center. Williamson will step into an open position in New Orleans, which recently agreed to trade All-Star Anthony Davis, the last freshman to win the AP award, to the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cI\u2019m going to do anything to win. I\u2019m just going to do anything to win,\u201d Williamson said. The Memphis Grizzlies also quickly addressed a positional need by taking Murray State\u2019s Ja Morant with the No. 2 pick. The Grizzlies agreed to trade Mike Conley, their longtime point guard, to Utah a day earlier. They got a good replacement in Morant, who led Division I with 10 assists per game as a sophomore while averaging 24.5 points. \u201cI have some big shoes to fill in Mike Conley,\u201d Morant said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player. I wish him the best. Like I said before, it just means the Grizzlies see a lot in me.\u201d RJ Barrett then made it two Duke freshmen within the top-three picks when the New York Knicks took the guard who actually edged out Williamson to lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring. Knicks fans hoped they would get Williamson after finishing with the worst record in the league but seemed happy to end up with Barrett, loudly cheering and chanting \u201cRJ! RJ!\u201d when the pick was announced. \u201cThat was great,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that the city wants me here as much as I want to be here.\u201d De\u2019Andre Hunter of national champion Virginia was taken fourth but won\u2019t be teaming up with Williamson. The Pelicans acquired the rights to the pick in the Davis deal but agreed to trade it shortly before the draft to Atlanta. The original trade can\u2019t be official until July 6, so Hunter was outfitted with a Lakers hit and the draft board behind the stage listed the pick as belonging to the Lakers. The Cleveland Cavaliers then took Vanderbilt guard Darius Garland, who played in just five games because of a knee injury. Then it was another pick who won\u2019t be playing for the team that made it, with Jarrett Culver taken at No. 6 by Phoenix with a pick that the Suns agreed to trade to Minnesota for the No. 11 pick. That turned out to be Cameron Johnson, the second North Carolina player to be drafted after Chicago took Coby White at No. 7. Kentucky then had two straight picks, with PJ Washington going 12th to Charlotte and Tyler Herro 13th to Miami. Duke did even better by placing three in the top 10. Cam Reddish went 10th to the Hawks, making the Blue Devils the only team to pull off that feat since Florida placed Al Horford third, Corey Brewer seventh and Joakim Noah ninth after winning the 2007 national championship. The trades caused some confusion in Barclays Center beyond just players wearing hats of teams whose uniforms they won\u2019t wear. A brief \u201cBrooklyn! Brooklyn!\u201d chant broke out when the Nets were on the clock at No. 17, but the Nets had already agreed to deal that pick to Atlanta in yet another trade that won\u2019t become official until July 6. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Brandon Clarke and Mfiondu Kabengele followed Barrett into the NBA, giving Canada its best showing with four first-round picks.

A lottery prospect in Thursday\u2019s 2019 NBA Draft , the Virginia Tech sophomore has been working out with his cousin, LA Clippers guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. A lifelong Toronto Raptors fan, Alexander-Walker was anxious to watch what proved to be the Game 6 clincher against the Golden State Warriors. But even within the time zone, Alexander-Walker struggled to watch his favorite team clinch: just as Toronto was fending off the Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Alexander-Walker was making his way through Los Angeles International Airport, apparently without ready access to a big-screen in one of the travelers\u2019 bars or lounges. \u201cI\u2019m at LAX, I\u2019m on FaceTime and I\u2019m trying to get my friends to show me the screen,\u201d the guard from Virginia Tech said on the eve of the Draft, which will be held at Barclays Center in Brooklyn ( ESPN, 7 p.m. ET ). \u201cSo I\u2019m, like, yelling [as Toronto won]. People at the airport are looking at me like, \u2018What the heck is going on with this guy?\u2019 \u201d Alexander-Walker said. \u201cI got chills, to be honest. It felt unreal. \u2018Did they really just do that?\u2019 \u201d They did \u2014 the Raptors in a span of about two weeks went from hosting the first Finals game played outside the United States to becoming the league\u2019s first champion based outside the U.S. And now Alexander-Walker, Duke\u2019s RJ Barrett and several others like them are about to do more \u2014 flood the Draft with Canadians, lending an even stronger maple scent to the NBA\u2019s spring. \u201cI was jumping up and down screaming, watching the game,\u201d said Barrett, who had a better seat for the clinching game than Alexander-Walker and will have a better spot in Thursday\u2019s talent mart. Barrett is the consensus No. 3 pick , likely headed to the New York Knicks anywhere from 10 to 15 spots ahead of his countryman from Toronto. \u201cIt means a lot for our whole country,\u201d said Barrett, who grew up outside Toronto in Mississauga, Ontario. He is the son of Rowan Barrett, a Toronto native who played at St. John\u2019s, competed professionally overseas and helped the Canadian national team in the 2000 Olympics and in FIBA world championships. Not only is the elder Barrett the source of his son\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cRJ\u201d is short for Rowan Junior \u2014 he also is the current executive vice-president and GM of Canada Basketball. And his good friend Steve Nash, the two-time NBA MVP and Naismith Hall of Famer from Victoria, British Columbia, is RJ\u2019s godfather. All that pedigree makes Barrett one of the most heralded players in Canada\u2019s hoops history, up there in hype with the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 Andrew Wiggins, dubbed \u201cMaple Jordan\u201d as he generated excitement growing up in Vaughan, Ontario, before enrolling at Kansas. \u201c[The Raptors] are the only team we\u2019ve got,\u201d Barrett, the Blue Devils\u2019 6-foot-7 wing \u2014 teammate and roommate of No. 1 prospect Zion Williamson \u2014 said of the freshly crowned Raptors. \u201cI remember as a kid watching Chris Bosh, watching DeMar DeRozan. So I can only imagine what the young kids now are doing watching Kawhi Leonard, and seeing the whole team and how they\u2019re doing. Hopefully it inspires the nation.\u201d Canada already ranks as the NBA\u2019s second-biggest source of talent, as noted by commissioner Adam Silver before Game 1 of The Finals last month, with 13 of its citizens on rosters at the end of 2018-19. This will be the 10th consecutive Draft in which at least one Canadian gets selected, and there likely will be more to follow. According to multiple mock drafts , five players from Canada could hear their names read from the stage at Barclays Center. In addition to Barrett and Alexander-Walker, the top north-of-the-border prospects include Florida State forward Mfiondu Kabengele of Burlington, Ontario; Arizona State guard Luguentz Dort of Montreal, and Gonzaga forward Brandon Clarke , who was 3 years old when his family moved from Vancouver to Phoenix. Others with Canadian roots who could be in play Thursday: Michigan forward Ignas Brazdeikis of Oakville, Ontario, and Iowa State guard Lindell Wigginton of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. \u201cYou see it,\u201d said Barrett, who won\u2019t match Wiggins ( 2014 ) or Toronto\u2019s Anthony Bennett ( 2013 ) as the first selection overall but has the talent and training to perhaps surpass both in career impact. \u201cThere are more and more Canadian players coming. We\u2019re about to go crazy. We\u2019re about to do some amazing things.\u201d Ironically, with so much homegrown talent on the board, the Raptors don\u2019t have a first-round pick this year. They hold the No. 59 pick, one from the end, although a frenzied trade market is expected Thursday that could jumble the order of teams from No. 4 through No. 60. The 2014 draft established Canada\u2019s previous high for NBA selections, with Wiggins, Nik Stauskas and Tyler Ennis going in the first round and Dwight Powell getting picked in the second round. Those were the sort of players Barrett, Alexander-Walker and the others followed when their own games were starting to blossom as young teens. In all, 33 Canadian-born players have competed in the NBA (including lone Naismith Hall of Famer Bob Houbregs, 1953-58. Nash technically doesn\u2019t qualify because he was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, before his family moved to British Columbia.) But 18 have done so since 2012. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the next one, so I\u2019m watching my step,\u201d said Barrett, who led the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring (22.6 ppg) while breaking Kenny Anderson\u2019s 1991 ACC freshman record for points. \u201cJust trying to do the best I can for my country.\u201d Said Alexander-Walker: \u201cI remember looking up to the players, guys like Andrew Wiggins. Seeing them get drafted, I was like, \u2018Man, I want to do that.\u2019 I believe that there\u2019s kids that will try to follow me. So I try to be the best example I can be.\u201d What the Raptors accomplished may have a two-fold effect: Inspiring more Canadian kids to hit the blacktop and the gyms, while opening more NBA players\u2019 eyes to Toronto as a destination market . Or at least one that can be defined by its ability to compete for top players \u2014 a re-up by Leonard would help with that \u2014 and a championship. \u201cIt\u2019s the best city in the world,\u201d Alexander-Walker said. \u201cSo when you get to play basketball and live in one of the best cities \u2014 regardless of weather \u2014 you just have to enjoy it.\u201d Admittedly, he feels connected, part of the proverbial subject in the Raptors\u2019 slogan and rallying cry, \u201cWe The North.\u201d He\u2019s one of them. Nickeil-Alexander grew up in Ontario rooting for the franchise that is four years older than him. \u201cAs a kid, I missed the Vince Carter era by a little bit. But definitely a big Raptors fan,\u201d Alexander-Walker said. \u201cYou were always like, \u2018This could be the year.\u2019 And then it wasn\u2019t the year. \u201cI\u2019m glad this year was [it].\u201d Might soon be saying the same about this Draft. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Though it was reported earlier Tuesday that Horford was expected to decline his $30.1 million player option for 2019-20, it was tinged toward a potential return . Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald reports that contract talks have now apparently shifted toward Horford exiting Boston . News of Horford\u2019s imminent departure from the Celtics was also reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski as well . Less than a week ago, Celtics star guard Kyrie Irving decided to not opt into his deal for next season. That leaves the Celtics reportedly preparing for a nightmare scenario in which both Horford and Irving walk in free agency, with nothing to show for their recent run of high-profile asset acquisition. Bulpett reports that Horford is expected to sign a four-year contract somewhere else this summer. Horford\u2019s side was interested in staying in Boston at a more team-friendly contract number if the team were willing to add two additional years to the deal, Bulpett reports. Boston seemed willing to do that and the two sides engaged in talks along those lines, but then things fizzled out suddenly. Wojnarowski reports there was \u201ctoo great of a gulf\u201d between what the team is willing to offer and what Horford wanted in a long-term deal. Additionally, Wojnarowski reports Celtics president Danny Ainge and Horford\u2019s agent, Jason Glushon, aren\u2019t expected to restart contract talks. According to Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer , the Dallas Mavericks are \u201cconsidered favorites\u201d to land Horford. A. Sherrod Blakely of NBC Sports Boston reports the Nets might also be in the running for Horford\u2019s services, too. Wojnarowski previously reported Horford and the Celtics had interest in working toward a new deal in July, one that would help Boston\u2019s salary cap flexibility. Team president Danny Ainge said in early June that he was hoping to discuss restructuring the All-Star big man\u2019s contract, a move he called a priority this summer. A five-time All-Star, Horford averaged 13.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.3 blocks per game last season for the Celtics, appearing and starting in 68 games. Overall, the former No. 3 pick in the 2007 draft has averaged 14.1 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 3.2 apg and 1.2 bpg in his career. With Horford seemingly on the way out \u2014 and Irving likely to move on as well \u2014 the Celtics could have salary cap space in the high $20 millions."},{"id":33091,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-grizzlies-trade-conley-jazz","date":"2019-06-19","title":"Reports: Grizzlies trade Mike Conley to Jazz","content":" The Utah Jazz are the next team this summer to pull off a reported big trade. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN , the Memphis Grizzlies are trading point guard Mike Conley to the Jazz for Grayson Allen, Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder, the No. 23 pick in the 2019 Draft and a future first-round pick. Wojnarowski reports the Jazz will send a protected 2020 first-round pick to the Grizzlies, which will convey as a late lottery pick in 2020 or 2021 or become a lightly protected pick from 2022-24. David Cobb of The Commercial Appeal reports the first-round pick Memphis is acquiring will only convey in 2020 or \u201921 if it ends up being between No. 8-14. The deal is expected to be completed on July 6. Conley will replace Utah\u2019s starting point guard from the last two seasons, Ricky Rubio. Pairing Conley with rising star Donovan Mitchell figures to give the Jazz one of the best backcourts in the league next season and would seem to bolster Utah\u2019s chances in a rapidly changing Western Conference. A former Ohio State standout, Conley has two more years left on his contract, with an early termination option in the final year. Shortly after the reported trade came through, Conley posted the following on Twitter : \u201cWhat more can I say about my city! You guys made me the man I am today! Memphis is home. Always!..Time for another chapter! Excited to give all I have to The Jazz and Salt Lake City! #LetsGetIt #GodsPlan #takenote.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/mconley11\/status\/1141384905408036865 Additionally, Rubio posted the following on Twitter after the trade happened: \u201d \u2026 it\u2019s time to just be happy. Being angry, sad and overthinking isn\u2019t worth it anymore. Just let things flow. Be positive.\u201d The Jazz reportedly were in the hunt for Conley during the 2018-19 season, with trade talks between the sides for the guard heating up at the trade deadline . Ultimately, that deal fell through and Conley remained in Memphis. He turns 32 on Oct. 11 and played only 12 games in 2017-18 because of a painful left heel that needed season-ending surgery. But Conley returned last season to play 70 games and scored a career-best 21.1 points per game. He was just off his career highs with 6.4 assists per game and averaged 1.3 steals per game. Overall, Conley is the Grizzlies\u2019 all-time leader in games played, points scored, assists, steals, field goals made and 3-pointers made. Conley was the final piece of the core that led the Grizzlies to seven consecutive playoff berths, including the 2013 Western Conference Finals. Zach Randolph and Tony Allen left in 2017 as free agents, and Memphis traded Marc Gasol to Toronto in February, splitting up a duo that had been the NBA\u2019s longest-tenured teammates. Gasol went on to help the Raptors win their first NBA title. This Conley-to-Utah trade comes days after another team looking to rise the ranks in the West, the Los Angeles Lakers, made perhaps the biggest blockbuster move of the offseason. Last Saturday, the New Orleans Pelicans reportedly agreed to trade superstar big man Anthony Davis to the Lakers for a combination of picks and Lakers youngsters. Memphis now has the No. 2 overall pick in Thursday\u2019s Draft as well as the No. 23 pick as it looks to build a team around last year\u2019s top pick, Jaren Jackson Jr. Of the young players on the Grizzlies\u2019 roster from last season, only backup point guard Delon Wright is a free agent this summer (and he is a restricted one). The Grizzlies are busy rebuilding after drafting Jackson Jr. fourth overall last year. Memphis hired its new coach, Taylor Jenkins, last week having made what management called a \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201clong-term commitment\u201d to Jenkins. For the Jazz, acquiring Conley is a multi-faceted move as well. First, it all-but assures that power forward Derrick Favors will be back next as his contract becomes guaranteed after July 6. That will allow Utah to keep its big frontcourt pairing of he and defensive big man Rudy Gobert together. Second, adding Conley shores up playmaking and 3-point shooting for the Jazz \u2014 two areas that have been weak points for the team over the last two seasons. Utah was 14th in offensive rating in 2018-19 ( 110.2 ) and second overall in defensive rating ( 105.2 ) last season, while also scoring 32.5 percent of its points off 3-pointers (which was ninth in the NBA). The Jazz made the playoffs and won 50 games in 2018-19, but lost 4-1 to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. That was a bit of a letdown after a surprising run to the Western Conference semifinals in 2018. Lastly, the Jazz did not have to part with oft-injured guard Dante Exum in the deal, which allows Utah to retain some backcourt depth in the wake of the reported trade. In taking on Conley in the trade, the Jazz are out of the running for the bigger names in this summer\u2019s free agent period , which commences at 6 p.m. on June 30.

Milwaukee Bucks All-Star swingman Khris Middleton has reportedly declined his $13 million player option for next season, his agent, Mike Lindeman, told ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The Bucks and Middleton are planning to work toward a new long-term deal as he is expected to command a five-year max contract to stay in Milwaukee. If he opts to sign elsewhere, Middleton would be eligible for a four-year max deal with another NBA team. In not opting in with the Bucks, Middleton joins a growing list of new names on the unrestricted free-agent market that includes the Boston Celtics\u2019 Al Horford and Kyrie Irving , the Sacramento Kings\u2019 Harrison Barnes and the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 Julius Randle . Middleton averaged 18.3 points, six assists and 4.3 rebounds this season en route to earning his first career All-Star selection. Middleton said at season\u2019s end he first will consider what\u2019s best for himself and his family and then consider which team he fits with best. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun and a new position,\u201d Middleton said at his exit interview in late May. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunity.\u201d The Bucks had the best record in the NBA during the regular season and were two wins shy of reaching The Finals. Now, the franchise and its fans must face the reality that the roster \u2014 outside of Eric Bledsoe and superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 could look a lot different next season. Milwaukee has starters Malcolm Brogdon (restricted) and Brook Lopez (unrestricted) as well as reserves Tim Frazier (unrestricted) and Nikola Mirotic (unrestricted) as free agents this summer. The Bucks became just the sixth team in NBA history to win the first two games in either the conference finals or NBA Finals and then drop four straight to lose the series. But Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, who led Milwaukee to a league-best 60-22 record during the regular season, made quite an impression in his first season.

According to Goodwill, the dynamic between Rockets stars James Harden and Chris Paul has become \u201cunsalvageable\u201d after a difficult season in Houston. The relationship reportedly reached the point where Paul demanded a trade and Harden issued a \u201chim or me\u201d ultimatum after the Rockets\u2019 second-round loss to the Golden State Warriors. Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has refuted the report and says Paul will be on the Rockets\u2019 roster next season, according to the Houston Chronicle \u2018s  Jonathan Feigen . Morey told the newspaper he, Harden and Paul have spoken extensively about the team\u2019s plans in free agency, including getting the star duo\u2019s input on a variety of potential names the Rockets might target. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not true,\u201d Morey told the Houston Chronicle . \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d When asked if Paul or any of his representatives have sought a trade, Morey told the newspaper: \u201cNo. Can you convey my disdain in my \u2018no.\u2019 It\u2019s so annoying at this point. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to Chris since (they were eliminated by the Warriors), for sure. Myself, Mike D\u2019Antoni, James Harden are all super competitive, all frustrated we were eliminated from the playoffs, all want to get over the hump. That leads to a lot of competitive fire. All of it is normal. We\u2019re all in the same boat, pursuing the championship. We\u2019re all frustrated we\u2019re not there. But there is nothing past that.\u201d That was followed by another on-the-record comment to ESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe, reconfirming the denial of a trade request. \u201cTweet that I said that. Print it. Tweet it twice,\u201d Morey said to Lowe. Paul responded to the news on Instagram, writing \u201cDamn! That\u2019s news to me\u2026\u201d in the comments of a post from Bleacher Report . Here\u2019s more from Goodwill on the reported problems in Houston: Goodwill\u2019s report follows up other offseason trade rumblings surrounding Paul and the Rockets, but Morey continues to insist that both sides are in a good place. Morey did not dispute the idea that Harden and Paul had a blow up after the Rockets\u2019 Game 6 loss to Golden State in the Western Conference semifinals. However, Morey told the Houston Chronicle that the interaction following that loss was a typical back-and-forth between the stars. Additonally, the Rockets have often said they challenge one another \u2014 sometimes in an extremely pointed manner. The Rockets GM told the Houston Chronicle he has spoken with Paul often enough in the offseason to know that Paul expects to stay in Houston and has not expressed a desire to be traded. The Rockets are expected to have only the $5.7 million mid-level exception to spend in free agency, but could seek a larger deal via sign-and-trade deals or via a trade for a potential free agent (much like Paul was when he was dealt to the Rockets in 2017). \u201cWith both Chris and James, we\u2019re talking about potential mid-level guys, potential top guys we might be able to trade for,\u201d Morey told the Houston Chronicle . \u201cI distinctly remember one time they both face-timed me and I walked through 50 free agents and got their opinion on them together, if that gives you a sense of how tightly they are tied together.\u201d If the Rockets did decide to trade Paul, they may have a difficult time finding a trade partner. The 34-year old guard reportedly is due to make $38.5 million, $41.3 million and $44.2 million over the next three seasons, which would be a lot of salary for another team to absorb in a trade. Paul \u2014 who missed 24 regular season games due to injury \u2014 finished the 2018-19 season with averages of 15.6 points, 8.2 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 2.0 steals."},{"id":33130,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-parade-shooting-two-injured-two-arrested","date":"2019-06-19","title":"Toronto police seek 4th person in Raptors rally shooting","content":"TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Police are looking for a fourth person and haven\u2019t recovered the gun involved in a shooting at a rally for the NBA champion Raptors that wounded four people and sent thousands fleeing, authorities said Tuesday.

(AP) \u2014  A diversity report shows the NBA still leads men\u2019s professional sports leagues in racial and gender hiring practices. The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida on Tuesday indicated almost identical scores from last year. The grade for racial hiring was an A-plus with an unchanged 98.7 score. The grade for gender hiring was a B, but slid slightly to 80.9. The overall grade was an A at 89.8. That was better than Major League Soccer\u2019s B-plus, the NFL with a B and Major League Baseball with a B-minus. The NHL doesn\u2019t participate in the study. The only professional league with a higher grade from the past year was the WNBA, with an overall A-plus and 97.6 score. Richard Lapchick, the TIDES director and lead report author, said the NBA has \u201calways had a leadership position\u201d regarding diversity initiatives. The study\u2019s release comes less than a week after the Cleveland Cavaliers hired California women\u2019s head coach Lindsay Gottlieb from the college level as an assistant coach, making her the seventh woman serving as an assistant coach or player development staffer. \u201cWe always look forward to this report in particular because we know we\u2019re going to see encouraging things,\u201d Lapchick said in an interview with The Associated Press . The study examined the racial and gender breakdowns in numerous areas, such as players, coaches, trainers, front-office staffers at the team level and positions at the NBA headquarters. It reviewed data from the 2018-19 season. The report was particularly good for the NBA league office. It earned an A-plus for racial hiring with 37.6% of professional staff positions filled by people of color, the highest percentage recorded in the study. Women made up 39.7% of those positions for a gender grade of B-plus. Those were both better than scores for the team level, where people of color made up 31.6% of team management positions (still an A-plus) and women filled 30.9% of those positions for a gender grade of a C. The league also had 10 head coaches of color among the 30 franchises to start the season and earned an A-plus for its initiatives to promote diversity. Lapchick pointed to an emphasis starting under former commissioner David Stern in the 1980s. \u201cThe NBA is the only league that didn\u2019t have to enact a Rooney rule,\u201d said Lapchick, referring to the NFL\u2019s rule requiring teams to interview at least one minority candidate when searching for a head coach. \u201cThey\u2019ve just been hiring the best candidates and bringing in a diverse pool of candidates since David took over. And then he pushed that to the team level, where they don\u2019t have control but they do have a lot of influence.\u201d"},{"id":33120,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-harrison-barnes-unrestricted-free-agent","date":"2019-06-18","title":"Reports: Harrison Barnes will not opt in with Kings","content":" Sacramento Kings forward Harrison Barnes is planning to test the free-agent waters again in his career.

For now, however, the two-way star and two-time NBA Finals MVP still isn\u2019t saying whether he\u2019ll use it to keep a door open, or close it behind him and move on. Leonard spent several days partying with his teammates in Las Vegas and Los Angeles after last Thursday\u2019s Game 6 clincher, returning to Toronto in time to ride in one of five open-top double decker buses that carried the Raptors along a crowded parade route . A three-time All-Star and two-time NBA defensive player of the year, Leonard is expected to decline the player option on the final year of his contract and become a free agent. Toronto can offer him a five-year deal worth around $190 million, one year and some $50 million more than any other team. Before stepping on stage Monday for a ceremony in the square outside Toronto\u2019s City Hall, Leonard said he hasn\u2019t been thinking about his future. Instead, he\u2019s trying to extend the celebratory vibe as long as possible. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to stress, it\u2019s still time to have some fun. I\u2019ve just been enjoying my experience.\u201d After precisely two months of playoff basketball, Leonard doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left to be a fun guy \u2013 free agency gets underway at 6 p.m. on June 30. \u201cI\u2019m going to take the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need too many days to figure it out. We\u2019ll see what happens. Once that time comes, then we\u2019ll all lay the pros and cons out.\u201d Visibly bothered by soreness during stretches of the Eastern Conference Finals against Milwaukee, Leonard declined to say how much pain he endured en route to winning his second career title. \u201cWe\u2019re always battling through things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, knee pains, ankles, fingers. Everybody was just grinding it out.\u201d Injured for all but nine games in his final season with San Antonio, Leonard played 60 regular-season games for Toronto and another 24 in the postseason, upping his minutes once April arrived. While winning a trophy was an obvious success, Leonard said he\u2019s enjoyed all aspects of his season north of the border, even the varied Canadian weather. \u201cIt was a good experience, experiencing Mother Nature, all four seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cMan, it was a great experience. Everybody off the court was great. The fans, just meeting people in Canada. It\u2019s been fun.\u201d Fans chanted `Stay! Stay! Stay!\u2019 when Toronto mayor John Tory presented Leonard with the key. Later, the festive mood of the event was marred by gunfire. Four people were shot, leading to a stampede. Three people were arrested and two guns were recovered, Toronto police said. Leonard is one of three Raptors starters with uncertain futures. Center Marc Gasol also has a player option, while guard Danny Green is a free agent. Guards Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet, and forward Serge Ibaka, are heading into the final year of their deals. Ibaka and Leonard have become friends in their time together as teammates. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with him a lot during the season and in the playoffs, but after we won, I can see the man is happy,\u201d Ibaka said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important. We play this sport because we want to enjoy and have fun and be happy and be somewhere people love you. I\u2019m sure he feels that people here love him, and after this moment, that\u2019s the most important.\u201d Lowry attended the parade wearing a game-worn Damon Stoudamire pinstripe Raptors jersey. Stoudamire was the first player drafted by Toronto in 1995, and won rookie of the year honors in 1996. Lowry and Stoudamire were teammates in Memphis from 2006 to 2008."},{"id":33149,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lamelo-ball-illawarra-hawks-australia","date":"2019-06-18","title":"LaMelo Ball, 17, signs with Australian team to prep for NBA","content":" SYDNEY (AP) \u2014 American teenager LaMelo Ball has signed with the Illawarra Hawks for the upcoming National Basketball League season, the second top U.S. prospect to join the Australian league under its Next Stars Program.

The parade route ends in a square outside City Hall, where police have begun to lift those seeking safety over barricades to help them escape the crush. A child pulled over a barrier and onto a stretcher was among those evacuated. City officials have prevented any further entry into the square and have shut down several subway stations near the parade due to overcrowding. Mayor John Tory previously urged every resident to come celebrate the Raptors\u2019 first championship and declared Monday \u201cWe The North Day\u201d in Toronto, after the franchise\u2019s slogan. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to attend, as was Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Rapper and Toronto native Drake, among the Raptors\u2019 best-known fans, was celebrating alongside the players on one of the parade buses. Some 1.5 million fans withstood the conditions to attend the parade. Nicolas Caramanna, 21, said the crowd started to get rowdy shortly after he arrived at 9 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m really hot and tired, but I\u2019m going to stick around,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen else am I going to get a chance to do this?\u201d Many others chose to miss school or work.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report that New Orleans will send the 26-year-old superstar to Los Angeles in exchange for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks. Multiple reports added that the Pelicans\u2019 total haul of draft picks includes: this year\u2019s No. 4 overall selection, a top-eight protected pick in 2021 (which becomes unprotected in 2022 if it does not convey), the right to swap first-round picks with the Lakers in 2023, and an unprotected 2024 first-round pick that New Orleans can defer to 2025. The deal won\u2019t be officially completed until July 6 at the earliest due to salary cap reasons, according to Wojnarowski. If the Lakers wait until July 30 to complete the deal, they reportedly could clear enough cap space to sign a max-level free agent. Davis reportedly wanted to wind up with the Lakers ever since word leaked of his desire to leave New Orleans, the team that drafted him No. 1 overall in 2012. The six-time All-Star shares the same agent as LeBron James, who joined the Lakers via free agency in 2018. Wojnarowski adds that Davis plans to sign a new contract with the Lakers in 2020. After playing All-NBA-quality basketball for the three months of last season, Davis made it clear to Pelicans management in January that he preferred to play elsewhere. He sat out for over two weeks before returning on a limited basis, averaging just 22 minutes before ultimately sitting out the final seven games of the season. Marc Stein of The New York Times additionally reports that the Lakers, who will still boast ample cap space after this trade, will now set their sights on signing unrestricted free agent Kemba Walker. The Hornets point guard is coming off his third consecutive All-Star season and first All-NBA (Third Team) campaign. The 29-year-old, who averaged a career-high 25.6 points in 2018-19, has played his entire eight-year career in Charlotte. The Pelicans will now shift to a new era, one that begins with the No. 1 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. New Orleans is widely expected to select Duke standout Zion Williamson, who averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 1.8 blocks in his lone season with the Blue Devils. He would join a core that now includes two of the Lakers\u2019 previous three No. 2 overall picks in Ball and Ingram, as well as veteran guard Jrue Holiday. The Lakers, meanwhile, managed to complete the deal for Davis without including Kyle Kuzma. The 23-year-old forward, who was taken 27th overall in the 2017 Draft, is coming off a sophomore season in which he averaged 18.7 points on 45.6 percent shooting. He would remain to complete a frontcourt headlined by James and Davis. Assuming the trade is consummated, its ripple effect will be felt throughout what is assumed to be an active offseason. Boston had long been reported as keen on acquiring Davis. Now that he is no longer available, the Celtics\u2019 attention shifts to pending free agent and All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving. Without the prospect of Davis joining the team, Irving will have to decide whether the Celtics\u2019 current situation is preferable to other teams that will vie for his services. The Draft could also see significant upheaval. The Pelicans become the first team to hold two of the top four picks since Cleveland in 2011. Wojnarowski reports that New Orleans is already receiving interest from teams eager to acquire the fourth overall pick, an avenue by which the Pelicans could further improve their immediate and long-term future. * * * "},{"id":33132,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-pelicans-julius-randle-opts-out","date":"2019-06-17","title":"Report: Pelicans' Julius Randle declines player option, enters free agency","content":" While the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 future draft picks are currently sucking up all the intrigue, a former lottery pick on their roster is reportedly ready to make noise as a free agent. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, power forward Julius Randle will decline his player option for the upcoming season, becoming a free agent ahead of a wide-open class unexpectedly affected by injuries to two of its top talents in Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Randle posted career-best numbers across the board last year with the Pelicans, a line boosted further still following Anthony Davis\u2019 post-trade-demand minutes reduction. It was Randle\u2019s first season topping 20 points per game and also his first attempting volume 3-pointers, not only tripling his previous high with 2.7 3-pointers attempted but also shooting a career-best 34.4 percent from distance."},{"id":33174,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10-most-intriguing-free-agents","date":"2019-06-16","title":"In summer of 2019, these 10 free agents provide most intrigue","content":" We knew that the postseason would affect free agency. But the idea was that the success or failure of certain teams would affect what their free agents\u2019 thoughts about staying or leaving. Unfortunately, the last two games of The Finals brought devastating injuries to two of the three most coveted free agents on the market. Kevin Durant, arguably the best player in the world, tore his Achilles in Game 5, just 12 minutes into his return from a calf injury. And Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6. The two injuries will certainly have repercussions beyond the two players and the Golden State Warriors. Maybe they already have. With the Western Conference seemingly wide open next season, the Los Angeles Lakers have reportedly made a deal for Anthony Davis , sending a bevy of young players and future picks to New Orleans so they can team the 26-year-old star with 34-year-old LeBron James \u2026 and maybe another star added in free agency. As always, the free agent market and the trade market are tied together. The pending Davis trade could affect the decisions of players and teams come July 1. And if teams miss out on the free agents they\u2019re seeking, they could always fill their cap space by making a trade. With all that in mind, the players listed below aren\u2019t necessarily the 10 best free agents (or potential free agents). They\u2019re the 10 (actually 12) most interesting in regard to where they\u2019re going and what kind of contract they get. For players to be on this list, there needs to be some intrigue regarding their (and\/or their team\u2019s) decision this summer. That\u2019s why Thompson isn\u2019t included. Whether he leaves or not, trading for Leonard last summer was well worth it for the Raptors, who won their first championship, with Leonard averaging 30.5 points per game in the postseason. The Raptors\u2019 \u201cload management\u201d program (which limited Leonard to just 60 games in the regular season) clearly worked, and director of sports science Alex McKechnie should be seen as a major asset in the quest to keep Leonard in Toronto. There should be a \u201crun-it-back\u201d sentiment for the new champs, with Danny Green also a free agent and Marc Gasol holding a player option this summer. A short-term deal would make sense, unless Leonard is looking for long-term security, having missed almost all of the 2017-18 season with a leg injury. It\u2019s all up to Leonard, maybe the toughest player in the league to read. If he takes his two-way talent elsewhere, the Raptors may have to go in a new direction. Number to know: In the postseason, Leonard had a true shooting percentage of 69.1 percent , the highest mark for a player that averaged at least 30 points per game in the playoffs and won the championship. Durant\u2019s torn Achilles probably won\u2019t scare any team, including the Warriors, from paying him as much as possible. As deep and talented as this free agent class is, the top two guys on this list are in a class by themselves. Rumors have long had Durant ready to leave Golden State and even with his injury, he seems more likely than Thompson to find a new home. But an ESPN report had Thompson\u2019s father talking about \u201cunfinished business\u201d after overhearing a conversation between the two injured Warriors. Durant could always put free agency off for a year by exercising his player option and remaining on the Warriors\u2019 payroll through his rehab. Number to know: Durant was the first player in NBA history to average 30 points per game in at least 10 playoff games while shooting at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line. The disappointment of the Celtics\u2019 season, along with Irving\u2019s questionable leadership with a group that underachieved, has taken some of the shine off his star. Irving\u2019s injury history also must be taken into consideration.  But talent is the most important thing in this league and Irving is one of its most talented players. He\u2019s still just 27 years old and he can still get buckets when buckets are needed. A return to Boston appears far less likely than it did six months ago (especially with Davis being traded elsewhere) and there have been a lot of signals that Irving is bound for Brooklyn. Number to know: In the regular season, Irving had an effective field goal percentage of 56.1 percent with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, the second-best mark among player with at least 50 clutch field goal attempts . The Sixers lost to the eventual NBA champions on a Game 7 buzzer-beater that bounced on the rim four times before falling through. They\u2019re right there. But their starting lineup, which outscored its opponents by more than 21 points per 100 possessions in 334 total minutes (regular season and playoffs), includes three free agents.  In regard to future assets, the Sixers didn\u2019t give up as much for Butler as they did for Harris. And of course, Butler has more baggage in regard to accepting his role. But, with his defense and his ability to get his own shot, he\u2019s is the most important of the three. Harris struggled a bit in the conference semifinals against Toronto and is the least important of the Sixers\u2019 three free-agent starters; J.J. Redick\u2019s shooting was clearly more critical in the postseason. But Harris isn\u2019t easily replaceable and he appears to be the most likely to leave, with a lot of teams looking for versatile forwards. Number to know: In the regular season, Harris shot 41.3 percent on pull-up 3-pointers, the second-best mark among 69 players who attempted at least 100 . Walker has expressed some level of loyalty to the Hornets . But immediately after the Davis trade was agreed to, there was a report that Walker would be a \u201ctop target\u201d of the Lakers with their cap space. Walker would be an ideal offensive complement to James and Davis, in that he can play off the ball (though he shot less than 35 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season ) and take some of the playmaking burden off of James\u2019 shoulders. The Hornets, meanwhile, would likely have a tough time upgrading their roster around Walker, with Nicolas Batum, Bismack Biyombo, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marvin Williams and Cody Zeller all under contract next season for a total of $85 million. Number to know: Walker led the league with 126 field goal attempts with the score within five points in the last five minutes . That was 43 percent of the Hornets\u2019 total (295). His effective field goal percentage on those shots (49.6 percent) ranked 15th among 45 players with at least 50 clutch field goal attempts . A finalist for the Kia Most Improved Player award, Russell took a big step forward this season, both in regard to his production and his maturity. He earned himself an All-Star appearance and helped the Nets reach the playoffs with a 14-win increase from last season. He\u2019s only 23 years old and is one of the league\u2019s most flammable shooters. But because he doesn\u2019t get to the basket or the free throw line very often, Russell is neither all that efficient (his true shooting percentage of 53.3 percent ranked 66th among 94 guards with at least 500 field goal attempts ) nor consistent, and he struggled (shooting 36 percent) in Brooklyn\u2019s first-round loss to Philadelphia. If the Nets are targeting another ball-handler in free agency (with Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie already under contract), they\u2019ll probably let Russell head elsewhere. Number to know: In the regular season, Russell ranked second with 11.4 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game. He scored 0.89 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, the 26th best mark among 44 players that averaged at least five ball-handler possessions . Cousins hadn\u2019t made it back to 100 percent from his Achilles tear before he suffered a torn quad in his second career playoff game. He made it back for The Finals from that injury and showed flashes of his old self with 14 important points in the Warriors\u2019 Game 5 win and a big bucket in the final minute of Game 6 . But he also struggled on both ends of the floor at times, and the Warriors were outscored with him on the floor in seven of his eight playoff games . Now he goes back on the free agent market with teams still not sure of what they\u2019re getting.  Looney is an unrestricted free agent at 23 years old, and he was the Warriors\u2019 most important center this season. The Western Conference champs have Looney\u2019s Bird rights, but they could also be spending a lot of money to retain Durant and Thompson (and possibly extend Draymond Green). Another team might have a larger role and more money for an improving young big. Number to know: In the regular season, the Warriors\u2019 lineup of Curry, Thompson, Durant, Green and Looney scored 121.5 points per 100 possessions and outscored opponents by 18.7 per 100. Those were the best marks for points scored and point differential per 100 possessions among 40 league-wide lineups that played at least 200 minutes together. The Milwaukee Bucks were the best team in the league through the first two games of the Eastern Conference finals. But, with four of their top eight players being free agents (or potential free agents) this summer, they have a lot of work to do if they want to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo surrounded by players who can get it done on both ends of the floor. Brogdon, Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez are the three key pieces. They\u2019re all due a pay raise and they all belong on this list. Brogdon is the restricted free agent, but he\u2019s also the youngest of the three (he\u2019ll be 27 in December) and the one that could be projected into a larger role on another team. Number to know: Brogdon shot 47.5 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the third-best mark among 223 players who attempted at least 100 . After five years in the league, Randle is still just 24 years old. So he\u2019s not necessarily a bad fit for David Griffin\u2019s plans for the future in New Orleans. But the Pelicans might not be ready to commit the money Randle is seeking (should he opt out of the final year of his contract) after averaging a career-high 21.4 points per game . He reportedly declined his player option for 2019-20 , which will put him on the open market this summer. Defense remains an issue, but Randle has expanded his offensive skill set; he was a respectable 34.4 percent from 3-point range this season, taking 18 percent of his shots from beyond the arc (up from six percent over his three previous full seasons). Number to know: Randle averaged 13.2 points in the paint per game, seventh most in the league , and he made more 3-pointers (67) than all but one of the six players in front of him. According to Rubio himself , he\u2019s not Utah\u2019s top priority in free agency. He remains a good defender and one of the league\u2019s best passers, but the Jazz need to get more potent offensively if they\u2019re going to take the next step.  At 31.1 percent, Rubio ranked 153rd in 3-point percentage among 163 players with at least 200 attempts . There could be as many as 10 teams (not including the Jazz) in need of a starting point guard this summer, and Rubio could have more value on a team more in need of a distributor. Number to know: The Jazz were 5.8 points per 100 possessions better offensively with both Rubio and Donovan Mitchell on the floor (scoring 110.4 per 100) than they were with Mitchell on the floor without Rubio (104.6). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Suffice it to say he was a bit anxious. So, when his first offer \u2014 from a mid-major school \u2014 came when the recruiting period opened in September, Kabengele, at the time a 6-foot-6 forward, wanted to jump on it. Luckily for Kabengele, cooler heads prevailed. Dave Maravilla, Don Bosco\u2019s founder, convinced him to be patient, that his game was certain to improve and bigger schools, maybe even from power conferences, would take note. Maravilla was right. Florida State assistant coach Dennis Gates, who played at Cal and earned a degree there in three years, has staked his reputation as a sharp and relentless recruiter by keeping his eyes and ears open and staying mobile: \u201calways going into different gyms, just looking,\u201d he says. In 2015, Gates got tipped off about Kabengele \u2014 whose uncle is NBA Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo \u2014 so he trekked to his native Chicago to see the player square off in a game against Kennedy-King, a junior college in the city\u2019s South Side. \u201cI get there and see this kid, never backing down against tough, inner-city JUCO kids,\u201d Gates says. \u201cHe was shooting, diving on the floor, rebounding, posting up. He had an inner toughness, resiliency and creativity. At 6-6, I thought he could make a good forward in the [Atlantic Coast Conference].\u201d FSU coach Leonard Hamilton gives his assistants unilateral authority to offer scholarships. Gates quickly decided Kabengele was worth pursuing.  \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want anybody to know,\u201d Gates says, laughing at the recollection. \u201cI know the coach at Kennedy-King, Da\u2019Veed Dildy, and after the game, he asked me what I was doing there. I said I was just checking guys out, and he said, \u2018man, you\u2019re here to see that kid we just played. Nobody comes to the Englewood community just to check guys out.\u2019 \u201d Gates was busted, but it didn\u2019t matter. Other power conference schools eventually noticed Kabengele, too, but Florida State was the first to offer a scholarship, and that\u2019s where he ended up. \u201cAfter our game, I see coach Gates in the locker room,\u201d Kabengele says. \u201cHe said, I want to offer you a scholarship to FSU. My jaw dropped. You visualize this your whole life. I was shocked, frozen. That hit Twitter and my name got out there and bigger schools started recruiting. But coach Gates put his trust in me. His job was on the line if I\u2019d turned out to be a bum. Of course I was going to go to FSU.\u201d By the time he showed up in Tallahassee, Kabengele was a different player than the one Gates first spotted. He\u2019d grown four inches to 6-10 and weighed more than 250 pounds. \u201cSo he gets on campus,\u201d Gates says, \u201cand the first thing he said to me is \u2018coach, I\u2019m better than Jonathan Isaac [a 6-10 freshman who would become just the second FSU one-and-done player and was eventually the No. 6 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft].\u2019 So I say have you ever played against him, and he says, no, but I\u2019ve watched him on YouTube. I thought, oh no, here we go again, another millennial.\u201d Eventually a one-on-one match was arranged between Kabengele and Isaac. \u201cFi sprains his ankle trying to play Jonathan, who crossed him over. Fi couldn\u2019t keep up. He comes back to my office and says, \u2018coach, Jonathan\u2019s a good player.\u2019 \u201d The lesson Kabengele learned that day was stored away and helped propel him to the brink of this week\u2019s NBA Draft, where he\u2019s been predicted to be taken anywhere from the late lottery to early second round.  Florida State was so flush with talent when Kabengele was a freshman Hamilton and his staff encouraged him to redshirt. Suffice it to say Kabengele was reluctant. \u201cIt was a hit to the ego,\u201d he says. \u201cYou tell your friends you\u2019re going to be the next superstar at Florida State, but we had Jonathan Isaac and so many pros on that team. The coaches knew redshirting would be better than playing one minute a game. You\u2019re fragile at that stage.\u201d Fragile, and not in good enough physical condition to play in the ACC. \u201cHe got here carrying too much weight,\u201d says Stan Jones, a Florida State assistant and respected tactician who coaches the post players. \u201cThe first workout we did dunk drills. He couldn\u2019t finish. We never quit here, so we made him finish the drill with a tennis ball. But even though he had to get in elite shape and had some skill improvement to do, you could see Fi was ready to accept challenges.\u201d Jones worked individually or had heart-to-heart conversations with Kabengele every chance he could, tweaking his jump shot mechanics, working on post moves, and perhaps most important, getting inside his head. \u201cWe talked a lot about the mental game,\u201d Kebengele says. \u201cStuff some of his players had trouble with in the past. But he let me figure things out for myself. He\u2019d tell me a story about a player\u2019s trials and tribulations and ask me, \u2018what do you think he did right? What do you think he did wrong? What should he have done? I learned so much.\u201d He also learned a lot mimicking the opposing team\u2019s best player while practicing as part of the scout team. \u201cOne time I was Jayson Tatum [Duke], another time I was Bonzie Colson [Notre Dame],\u201d Kabengele says. \u201cThat was fun. [Clemson\u2019s] Jaron Blossomgame was my favorite. I learned a lot of iso plays and guys zeroed in on me.\u201d Kabengele was ready by time he became eligible for the 2017-18 season. He became a key reserve on an NCAA Tournament Elite Eight team, averaging 7.2 points and 4.6 rebounds and shooting .385 from 3-point range in 14.8 minutes a game. Kabengele was such a weapon coming off the bench that \u2014 and Hamilton gave him a vote in the decision \u2014 he didn\u2019t start last season. But his numbers jumped \u2014 Kabengele and Robert Martin of Rice were the only players in the country to lead their teams in scoring without starting a game. Kabengele\u2019s numbers rose sharply across the board. He averaged 13.2 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.5 blocked shots and again was a threat from 3 (.369). Kabengele was voted the ACC\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year and earned a spot on the league\u2019s All-Academic team. Miffed that he was chosen no better than honorable-mention All-ACC, Mfiondu took it out on FSU\u2019s postseason opponents. In the NCAA tournament, he averaged 17 points, eight boards and two blocks. Shortly after the Seminoles\u2019 season ended in the Sweet 16, he pronounced himself ready for the NBA. As much as Kabengele\u2019s coaches hate to see him go, they agree with that assessment. \u201cHe\u2019s ready,\u201d Gates says. \u201cI say that because he doesn\u2019t have the distractions some kids may have. He\u2019s as focused a young man as I\u2019ve seen, determined as you\u2019ll get. He prides himself on his intelligence, and there\u2019s no better human being that you\u2019ll be around.\u201d Jones sees many of Kabengele\u2019s on-the-floor skills translating to the next level. \u201cHe\u2019s learned some old-school techniques,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe has a fantastic feel for offensive rebounding and has the ability to get to the front of the rim and get off the floor for a tip, or a tip dunk, or a rebound in traffic. He can really run the floor and get behind the defense for lobs. The analytics say he\u2019s not a good passer or playmaker, but people will see when he gets to the NBA, he\u2019s got an excellent feel for the game. And he put in a lot of work on jump shot mechanics. He\u2019s a face-up threat, too.\u201d Kabengele\u2019s stock has risen as he\u2019s taken the requisite tour of NBA teams; he\u2019s worked out for eight of them. FSU coaches had to squelch a rumor about knee issues \u2014 pure fiction, says Jones \u2014 another factor in his rise up the draft boards. Kabengele \u2014 remember he was on the ACC\u2019s All-Academic team \u2014 also excels in interviews. The way he sees it, not being a starter at Florida State has uniquely prepared him for the NBA. \u201cI\u2019m going to be able to accept the role [of reserve],\u201d Kabengele says. \u201cNot only accept it but excel in it. I\u2019m going to bring a lot of energy and focus on being a great rebounder. At the next level, I\u2019ll be ready if they allow me to have that kind of role.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

New Orleans management, notably GM Dell Demps, resisted the power play then. Of course, Demps lost his job after resisting the trade demand and seeing the ripple effects undermine his own team\u2019s season. Demps\u2019 replacement, David Griffin, took over on a more traditional timeline \u2014 one year out from the dreaded possibility of having a star free agent walk without compensation. After apparently trying to change Davis\u2019 mind, Griffin did what he felt he had to do. So the six-time All-Star doesn\u2019t have to wait until the summer of 2020, or even the trade deadline in February, to swap a less glamorous market for the bright lights and a franchise that has never won for the Lakers\u2019 legacy of champions built around elite big men. What cost did Davis pay for his trade demand? Not much. His playing time plummeted from about 37 minutes in the first four months of 2018-19 to 22 in the 16 games he actually played after Jan. 18. He did not participate at all in 21 games as New Orleans tried to protect its asset, which derailed any ambitions with which the Pelicans began the season. They went 12-24 in those 36 games to fall into the lottery \u2013 and land the No. 1 pick. But that didn\u2019t concern Davis. He got what he wanted. The Pelicans got what they could. There\u2019s a time-value to money and there\u2019s a time-value in trades, too. The best time for Griffin to deal was now, with the No. 4 pick in this year\u2019s Draft in play to team with the No. 1 pick that presumably will be on Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson. Landing that, along with two more first-round picks from the Lakers, a Draft pick swap in 2023 and players Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart (per ESPN\u2019s report), shifts New Orleans into full rebuild mode with an exciting core of current and maybe future young players. Could Griffin have gotten more had he waited deeper into the offseason or heading toward the in-season trade deadline? Perhaps. But Boston, the other oft-purported suitor for Davis, no longer could count on teaming Davis with Kyrie Irving, who will explore free agency (and likely leave ). Besides, the Celtics never did want to part with Jayson Tatum, so what they could offer the Pelicans was limited. Didn\u2019t matter, anyway. Griffin didn\u2019t want to drag this into a new season. In fact, he might work the phones to find point guard Jrue Holiday\u2019s market value. As strong as Holiday is as a leader and two-way player, at 29 with 10 seasons in, he\u2019s out of sync with the new era in N\u2019Awlins. OK, the Lakers had committed publicly to keeping Kuzma, the overachieving forward and No. 27 pick in 2017, out of the deal. And as noted above, the Pelicans were on the clock to make a clean break with Davis pre-Draft. But would the Lakers really have scuttled the deal if Griffin had held out for Kuzma? Some say yes, as the time factor gave them leverage. I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019m reminded of the blockbuster deal that sent Kevin Garnett from Minnesota to Boston in 2008. Word eventually got out that Kevin McHale, the Wolves\u2019 president of basketball operations, had wanted a raw point guard named Rajon Rondo in the package of players Minnesota received. His Celtics\u2019 counterpart and buddy, Danny Ainge, pushed Sebastian Telfair instead. But with Paul Pierce and Ray Allen on board, and Garnett so close to his wearing o\u2019 the green, would Ainge have blown up the trade over young Rondo? Same applies here. So the positive spin on Kuzma staying put is, the Lakers did well to keep him. That statement might offend a few folks. Dwyane Wade for one. Maybe Irving, Chris Bosh or Kevin Love, too. Heck, Davis might bristle at the idea of being anyone\u2019s \u201csidekick\u201d after being the man in Mardi Gras to this point in his career. But the truth can\u2019t be controversial, and the success of this deal will be measured in the short-term by how well Davis meshes with James in the superstar\u2019s quest for a fourth ring and beyond. Some believed that agent Rich Paul, who represents both James and Davis, was more concerned with helping the former than the latter, which Paul refuted a few days before news came out on this blockbuster trade. Who\u2019s to say AD wouldn\u2019t have thrived and won sooner in Boston had the Celtics and Pelicans worked out a Kawhi-like rent-a-player price? What if James not only is past his best years, but his most durable ones, and injuries intervene as he heads to age 35 and beyond to stymie title hopes? For James, though, there\u2019s no downside to this. Ingram, because of the blood clot issue that cut short his 2018-19 season, is an unknown for now. Ball isn\u2019t essential with James as a ball dominator. Hart actually backslid in his second season. And James has little or no use for draft picks at this stage of his career. Davis is good enough to carry the bigger load relative to James, more than any of his past Super Friends who all caught him in his extended prime. But it\u2019s still to be determined how they\u2019ll work that out \u2013 the two previous elite big men that he played alongside, Bosh and Love, wound up as No. 3 options once they teamed with James. Walker is a free agent who has served his time in Charlotte, a team that might not want to be locked into a super-max deal for their lone star anyway. He would be a nice backcourt complement to James and Davis, another scorer if not the pure shooter L.A. would seem to need. Speaking of which, that suggests other free-agent implications as the Lakers search for shooters. Say, if not J.J. Redick himself, then the next Redick perhaps. You\u2019ve got to admit, it would be something to see LeBron James pop up on the Western Conference\u2019s finalist vying for a championship, in what lately has been Golden State\u2019s accustomed spot. That\u2019s what some anticipated for this June, until the Lakers went sideways with injuries and dysfunction. But with ESPN\u2019s report of the Davis trade, a team that already was ranked atop the NBA\u2019s contenders for 2020 saw its odds improve. Caesars Sportsbook put the Lakers as 7-2 favorites, ahead of the Bucks (6-1), the L.A. Clippers (6-1), the newly crowned Raptors (8-1), the Rockets (8-1) and what would be a distinctly different Warriors team (11-1). * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

This time, that talent is joining him, as the New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to trade Anthony Davis to the Lakers in exchange for Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and a war chest of draft picks. James, however, could not be more excited at the prospect of joining forces with Davis. The 34-year-old superstar took to Instagram to voice his approval of the deal, exclaiming, \u201cAD on da way!! Let\u2019s get it bro! Just the beginning\u2026\u201d The post was accompanied by a photo of James and Davis, with the latter edited into a Lakers No. 21 jersey (a number that hasn\u2019t been worn by a Laker for more than one season since Josh Powell in 2010) James is surely optimistic that the arrival of Davis \u2014 combined with whatever the Lakers do with their remaining and ample cap space this offseason \u2014 will launch the Lakers into title contention. The Lakers spiraled to a 37-45 record after James missed 17 consecutive games due to injury in the middle of the season. Los Angeles has not made the playoffs since 2012-13, when the team was swept in the first round by the Spurs. This season marked James\u2019 first absence from the postseason since 2005, when he was a second-year player with Cleveland. The Lakers\u2019 midseason struggles fueled reports that James and the Lakers were eager to acquire Davis, who had made it known to New Orleans that he preferred to be traded to Los Angeles. That union became possible after the Lakers jumped from 11th to fourth in last months Draft Lottery. The Lakers ultimately decided that pick, two future first-rounders, two future pick swaps and most of their young core were worth acquiring Davis, a six-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA First Team honoree.

But I didn\u2019t follow up on it.\u201d Flash forward a couple months, and Bennett is in Atlanta to see a certain player when that skinny kid showed up again. Bennett\u2019s memory of the camp in Pennsylvania was quickly jogged, and he locked in on Ty Jerome . At that moment, Bennett took a key step toward winning the 2019 NCAA championship. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Ty\u2019s team was going to be there,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cBut I\u2019m watching him, and I said to myself, \u2018Wait a second. This is that guy I watched in Pennsylvania.\u2019 He was the best player on the floor. He managed the game. He made great plays.\u201d Thinking Jerome might be too good to be true, Bennett paid extra attention to the gangly 6-foot-5 point guard, making sure he could defend elite athleticism. Eventually convinced Jerome could, Bennett offered a scholarship. Soon after, several more power conference schools tried to become involved with Jerome, but it was too late. Bennett and his new point guard had already formed a special bond because, as the sons of basketball coaches, they were part of an exclusive club. Bennett\u2019s father is the legendary Dick Bennett, who won titles coaching in college, including at the University of Wisconsin and later at Washington State. Tony Bennett played for his father at Green Bay before going onto an NBA career (Charlotte Hornets) that was cut short by a foot injury. The younger Bennett eventually followed his dad into coaching, first at Washington State and for the last decade at Virginia, where his teams have dominated the rugged Atlantic Coast Conference, winning four of the last six regular-season championships. Jerome\u2019s father Mark was raised in Harlem and learned the game on asphalt, playing pickup games and street tournaments against unrelenting opponents, trash talking and heckling from fans. Mark Jerome thought that was the perfect environment to teach his son the game. Ty Jerome could have had no better college coach than Tony Bennett. \u201cWe talked about that a lot,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cThere\u2019s something built in when you play for your father. The one thing you know is that this is my dad. I know he loves me, and I know I can trust him. Even though at the time you might not feel like it. Sometimes, it gets emotional, and things become exaggerated.\u201d Jerome, forecast by many to be a first-round pick in this week\u2019s NBA Draft , knows that all too well. \u201cPlaying for my dad was the toughest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do,\u201d Jerome says. \u201cThat made me extremely mentally tough. When you play in New York City, if you\u2019re not ready to play or you\u2019re not mentally tough, you get exposed. It just builds a level of toughness you have to have to play out there.\u201d When he was younger, Jerome didn\u2019t appreciate his father\u2019s tough love approach as much as he would later. \u201cWe went for extended periods of time without talking\u2014sometimes two or three months,\u201d Jerome says. \u201cMy parents had split up, and after games, I went right to my mom. I didn\u2019t understand the bigger picture at six or seven years old.\u201d Jerome didn\u2019t have a choice but to play basketball. His father was a high school coach, so Jerome\u2019s second home was the gym. Father and son watched countless hours of live games or film. Mark Jerome even took his son to the same playgrounds where he had learned the game, the hard way. Was it excessive? Did Mark Jerome risk burning out his son at an early age? As it turned out, he knew exactly what he was doing. So did Tony Bennett, the second he laid eyes on Ty Jerome. Jerome endured his highs and lows during his freshman season at Virginia, but Bennett remembers him coming into his own in games against Notre Dame and then-No. 1-ranked Villanova. \u201cWe all thought we had something, if Ty just continued to develop,\u201d Bennett says. Jerome did. And along with De\u2019Andre Hunter (a certain lottery pick) and Kyle Guy \u2014 both of whom were recruited in Jerome\u2019s class \u2014 they helped the Cavaliers own the ACC the last two seasons. In 2017-18, Virginia finished 31-3, and an astounding 17-1 in a league with Duke, North Carolina, Louisville, Syracuse and NC State. In 2018-19, the Cavs were 16-2 in the ACC and 35-3 overall, capping an incredible season\u2014and one of the great comebacks in history\u2014by beating Texas Tech in an epic national championship game. But it\u2019s what happened in between those two seasons that defines Virginia basketball, its extraordinary coach, its resilient players, and perhaps Jerome in particular. In the 2018 NCAA tournament, the Cavaliers made history by becoming the first No. 1 seed to be ousted by a No. 16 seed. That stunning loss to UMBC evoked criticism and questions about whether Bennett\u2019s deliberate pace and pack line defense, so effective in the crucible of the ACC season, was ripe for such upsets in postseason play, where every opponent, with nothing to lose and everything to gain, can fire away with abandon from 3-point range and hope for the best. After the UMBC debacle, Bennett and his players pretended the outside world didn\u2019t exist. \u201cWe started the next day,\u201d Jerome says. \u201cIt was awesome the way everyone responded [to the loss]. We all grew closer. We knew what our goal was, and we weren\u2019t afraid to say it. We wanted to win the national championship. We knew how hard that would be, but our coaching staff did a great job of preparing us for what it was going to take, every single day.\u201d Virginia\u2019s run through the tournament has become the stuff of legend. There were heroes aplenty\u2014Guy was chosen Final Four Most Outstanding Player and Hunter scored 27 points in the title game, including a critical 3 to send it to overtime. But Jerome was always there, running the show, making key plays, pretty much playing the way he did when Bennett discovered him. In two Final Four games, Jerome averaged 18.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 7.0 assists. \u201cYou hear this saying a lot, but it\u2019s as true of Ty as anybody,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cHe has the \u2018it\u2019 factor. He\u2019s got the ability to do things. He\u2019s fearless and he\u2019s so competitive. He\u2019s got a mind for the game that\u2019s as good as it gets.\u201d Jerome has been hard at work since declaring for the Draft. \u201cAlways shooting and ball handling,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be a great shooter [he was a career 39 percent 3-point shooter at Virginia]. Not a good shooter. A great shooter.\u201d Jerome has also added mid-range floaters to his arsenal and has worked on playing through contact. His instincts to make plays for others are already ingrained. Jerome\u2019s goal is to be able to contribute right away, just like he did at Virginia. \u201cI want to get into the right fit,\u201d Jerome says. \u201cI\u2019d love to go to a good culture and hopefully a winning culture, learn from veterans and have the opportunity to contribute to win.\u201d Bennett has no doubt Jerome will be successful in the NBA. \u201cHe\u2019s such a winner,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cI\u2019d never bet against Ty; not a chance. He\u2019s so smart, he always figures ways out. Wherever he goes, he\u2019s going to figure out a way to contribute.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

( AP ) \u2014 Steve Kerr still considers Golden State an ideal fit for Kevin Durant. Whether Durant sees it that way going into free agency next month, Kerr isn\u2019t about to guess. Especially now that the two-time NBA Finals MVP is headed for what could be a yearlong recovery from surgery for a ruptured right Achilles tendon . \u201dWell, the injury kind of throws everything for a loop, so I have no idea what Kevin\u2019s going to do,\u201d Kerr said Friday. \u201dI know that we all want him back, and we think this is a great situation for him and vice versa. So, hopefully we get him back and keep this thing going with the understanding that he\u2019s a free agent and we want what\u2019s best for him, and he\u2019s free to make any choice he wants. Hopefully he\u2019s back, and we will all give him any advice, any counsel that he needs. And ultimately he\u2019s going to make his own decision. He\u2019s earned that.\u201d A day after losing Game 6 of The Finals to the champion Toronto Raptors, Kerr and general manager Bob Myers braced for an uncertain summer while still trying to cope with the heartbreak of seeing Durant go down in Game 5. Then Klay Thompson tore the ACL in his left knee during the third quarter of Thursday night\u2019s 114-110 loss in the final game at Oracle Arena. Durant was injured in Game 5 on Monday night in Toronto, then underwent surgery Wednesday in New York. \u201dThis year more than any other tested the fabric of our team,\u201d Myers said. \u201dIt\u2019s hard to not value a championship as much as I value short of winning a championship, and in some ways more than winning a championship, this year I might have been the proudest of our resolve. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s evident. I hear that from people in the Bay Area, the support we\u2019ve gotten, the things people say about kind of conducting ourselves as champions. That stuff matters. Winning matters, too, obviously. It\u2019s all matters. Try to continue to hang onto that culture.\u201d In February, Durant became frustrated over all the fuss and speculation about where he might play next season, and said \u201dI\u2019m trying to play basketball.\u201d He signed a two-year contract last summer that includes a player option for the 2019-20, so Durant can become a free agent to pursue a maximum five-year deal. The Warriors are expected to try to sign both Durant and Thompson to those max contracts. Asked how optimistic he is about bringing back Durant, an emotionally exhausted Myers said, simply, \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d while noting that free agency is \u201cnever what you think.\u201d \u201dHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s been, like I said, what more can we ask for from him?\u201d Myers said. \u201dHe\u2019s been everything to us, the guy has been everything that we could have ever dreamed. He\u2019s been an awesome member of this organization. There\u2019s so much he does in the community that probably doesn\u2019t get as many headlines, things he\u2019s done in D.C., his foundation, how he kind of lives his life. We\u2019re lucky to have been around him. Hopefully we\u2019ll keep doing that.\u201d All season, the Warriors were determined to cherish this ride together knowing the roster could look far different once training camp rolls around in September \u2013 along with the venue as Golden State moves across the bay to the new Chase Center in San Francisco. Golden State\u2019s players also insist they have never taken for granted the special five-year run featuring three championships and five consecutive Finals berths. \u201dIn the history of this NBA you could highlight every team that was supposed to win or had the best team and all the different story lines. And 82 games and a full playoff run, a lot can happen,\u201d Stephen Curry said. \u201dIt\u2019s just a matter of how much you fight and just leave it all out there on the floor. I think the way that we have talked and described this journey and whatnot, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a situation where we have taken anything for granted. And that\u2019s something I can look back and just hold. \u201dWe all can hold our head high that we gave it everything we got. \u2026 Two guys who go down and the game\u2019s kind of taken away from them in those moments, it\u2019s not a good feeling at all. And it\u2019s kind of a helpless feeling in terms of two freak plays that send these guys back to the locker room. So it\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s part of basketball, it\u2019s part of the game. Again, I just hope their recoveries are strong and they come back better than they were before.\u201d Thompson\u2019s knee surgery has not yet been set. Kerr doesn\u2019t expect to ever see two injuries this severe in consecutive Finals games again. He was still stunned a day later, and Myers, too. Now the GM must immediately turn his focus toward next week\u2019s draft and then free agency. Both expressed their tremendous pride in how the Warriors fought despite being denied a three-peat. \u201dYou\u2019re talking about two career-altering injuries to two of your best players in back-to-back Finals games. Unheard of. It will probably never happen again,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dWe\u2019re in new territory now and you just have to keep moving forward.\u201d"},{"id":46364,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-title-canada-ratings-records-ap","date":"2019-06-15","title":"Raptors' title sees Canada set viewing, spending records","content":"LAS VEGAS ( AP ) \u2014 The final numbers are in, and the NBA Finals were a smashing success for Canada all the way around. The NBA said Friday that 56% percent of the Canadian population watched at least some part of the NBA Finals, with an average viewership of about 8 million for the Toronto Raptors\u2019 title-winning victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 . The league also said the total combined U.S. and Canadian audience for the finals was up 11 percent over the combined viewership of the 2018 title series between Golden State and Cleveland. Thursday\u2019s game was the most-watched NBA game in Canadian television history, a record that was toppled several times during this postseason because of the Raptors\u2019 popularity. Viewership for each of the six finals games rank among the 10 most-watched television programs in Canada so far this year. \u201dEverybody who supported us during the season, all the fans in Toronto, everyone in Canada \u2013 this is for you,\u201d Raptors forward Serge Ibaka said after Toronto\u2019s first NBA championship. \u201dThis is for Canada, baby. You should be proud.\u201d And not only were Canadians watching, but they were buying. The NBA said that online sales through the league\u2019s official portals smashed records for the day following the end of a championship series, up more than 80 percent from the previous mark (set when Cleveland beat Golden State in 2016) and were more than 100 percent over sales on the day following the Warriors\u2019 sweep of the Cavaliers last season. The Raptors are planning a parade in Toronto on Monday, one that will likely take more than two hours. \u201dThis means so much to our city and to many in Canada, and we are looking forward to showing everyone the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy on Monday,\u201d Raptors president Masai Ujiri said. \u201dBringing the NBA championship to Toronto is the realization of a goal for our team and for our players, and we are thrilled to be able to celebrate together with our fans.\u201d The newly crowned NBA champions, who won the title in Oakland, California on Thursday night, are expected back in Toronto on Saturday. They were planning to spend Friday night celebrating in Las Vegas."},{"id":33227,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lessons-learned-game-6-finals","date":"2019-06-14","title":"Five things we learned from Game 6 of The Finals","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Five things we learned from the Toronto Raptors\u2019 114-110 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals at Oracle Arena:  More than one wag offered up the following sardonic thought on social media late Thursday and early Friday about the end of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 five-year run of Finals appearances: They would have been better off getting swept. Oh, there would have been grief heaped upon them, mockery even, as part of a backlash to their excellence since 2015. It goes that way in sports, in the culture: The shiny, new object is always the best, until it\u2019s no longer as shiny and definitely not as new. Lots of NBA fans had grown weary of the Warriors, so tired of seeing them dominate the Western Conference each spring and three of the previous four Finals that there really were multitudes eager to see them fall. A sweep would have delighted the schadenfreude set. That would have been preferable, though, to what happened in extending the 2019 Finals by two games. Had the Warriors been swept, Kevin Durant never would have returned from his right calf strain in Game 5 \u2013 and never would have torn the Achilles tendon in that leg, a far more severe injury that possibly wipes out Durant\u2019s 2019-20 season and maybe alters his career trajectory. Had the Warriors been swept, Klay Thompson would have reminded everyone of his durability and tenacity by playing with a pulled hamstring in Game 4, after missing Game 3. He never would have had to do it by making a pair of free throws on a torn ACL in his left knee Thursday and briefly acting as if he could finish out Game 6. Had the Warriors been swept, there would be all the expected questions about their roster and their future heading into a pivotal summer. But the clouds overhead wouldn\u2019t be nearly so dark. As it turned out, Golden State\u2019s magical stretch dating back to coach Steve Kerr\u2019s hiring in 2014 ends with both a bang and a whimper: snapping human tissue in two of the worst injuries any basketball player can suffer, followed immediately by pain as well as rightful concern and sympathy for the individuals more than the dynasty itself. The next few months were going to be a natural crossroads for the franchise all along. Move across the bay to a sparkling new arena, key free agents to re-sign or not, some alleged restlessness in Durant particularly and the simple passage of time in a league of rivals hungry to topple them. Now, with both Durant and Thompson out for much or all of next season \u2013 and will any team in recent memory have felt more pressure to err on the side of later rather than sooner in returning rehabbed players to action? \u2013 the Warriors are on the verge of being (gasp!) ordinary. Draymond Green and Steph Curry brought stiff upper lips to the postgame podium, but it seemed like so much barking into the wind. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe lost this year. Clearly just wasn\u2019t our year, but that\u2019s how the cookie crumbles sometimes. But, yeah, I hear a lot of that noise, \u2018it\u2019s the end of a run\u2019 and all that jazz. I don\u2019t see it happening though. We\u2019ll be back.\u201d Time and recoveries will tell. But this is important to note not just for the Toronto Raptors but others in the league and across sports: The Warriors\u2019 bad luck was not the Raptors\u2019 fault, and there should be no apologies from them, no asterisks attached to diminish their achievement. Staying healthy, or as close to that, is part of winning a championship at the end of a long, grueling season. There are plenty of examples in the NBA alone of title quests or defenses derailed by injuries, but those almost always wind up as subplots, generally forgotten, once the news ages into history. Remember how Kyrie Irving shattered his knee in Game 1 in 2015 and Kevin Love wasn\u2019t around for the Finals at all in 2015, when the Warriors beat Cleveland for their first ring? Well, yeah, but that didn\u2019t define Golden State\u2019s accomplishment. The same can be said for the Spurs beating a Patrick Ewing-less Knicks team in 1999 or Boston benefiting from Lucius Allen\u2019s absence to beat Milwaukee in seven games in 1974. It really is possible that the Warriors were ground down by their repeated Finals runs, that the wear and tear accumulated as they crammed the equivalent of a sixth season into a calendar meant for five. Toronto will be the champs with the quick turnaround to 2019-20. We\u2019ll see what they have left when the playoffs commence next April. If ever a team endured a pinch-me playoffs, it was the Raptors. Even as they were reaching new heights and winning over new fans in Canada and elsewhere, there was an awareness kept front and center in most fans\u2019 minds that this all could end rather unceremoniously come June 30. Will Kawhi Leonard stay, which is to say sign a new contract with Toronto when he hits free agency at the end of this month, or will he go? If \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d were still on the air, it might change its tagline to \u201cthe thrill of victory, the dread of what comes next.\u201d Raptors president Masai Ujiri gambled like a boss and cashed in beyond his wildest dreams. He fired his coach, Dwane Casey, and traded away the most loyal and popular player, DeMar DeRozan, from the franchise\u2019s recent run of nice seasons. All for an enigmatic talent who was never going to commit verbally or emotionally to his new surroundings, confetti and champagne be damned. So, uh, was it worth it? If Leonard signs with one of the Los Angeles teams (the Clippers are a long-rumored favorite) or some other offseason suitor, and sends Toronto into heavy scramble mode, will the present and just-completed past justify such an uncertain future? Of course it will, silly. Ujiri rolled the dice and won big. He, Leonard, coach Nick Nurse and the rest of them got the Raptors to a place they\u2019d never been and weren\u2019t headed anytime soon. You can take this lesson all the way back to Tennyson, who gave us the bachelor\u2019s and bachelorette\u2019s refrain \u201c\u2019Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\u201d Except, of course, that the Raptors won. They might not repeat. They might not even defend their league and conference titles in the East next spring. But they checked so many professional and passionate boxes for themselves and their fans that it\u2019s hard to imagine the other path \u2013 running back the same solid crew while expecting different results? That would require a switch in source material from Tennyson to Einstein, because that was the frizzy-haired genius\u2019 definition of insanity. The NBA already has too many teams fixated on the future at the expense of tonight\u2019s game and tomorrow\u2019s, playing it safe for lottery balls and job security. Bravo for Toronto for going for it, when it (with the departure from the East of LeBron James) presented itself regardless of assured duration. The winner of the Bill Russell Finals MVP Award is chosen annually in a vote of 11 media members selected by the NBA as a championship series reaches clinching altitude. Kawhi Leonard breezed to his victory for the award, getting 10 of the 11 votes from the, ahem, esteemed panelists. He did not get all 11, however: Venerable coach-turned-broadcaster Hubie Brown wrote Fred VanVleet on his ballot. Quickly, social media had its say \u2013 too often and too loud, as is its wont. How dare Brown vote for a backup Toronto point guard over the team\u2019s best player and points amasser not just in The Finals, but over the Raptors\u2019 2019 playoff run? Take his vote away, some opined. Seriously? People need to calm down. As someone who voted for LeBron James in 2015 \u2013 when his Cleveland team actually lost the championship to Golden State \u2013 I know how the zeal for unanimous agreement works. There were four of us that year who felt James\u2019 contributions to a hobbled Cavs team surpassed anything any single Warrior did over those six games. Brown happened to be alone in his take, but it was not without merit. VanVleet made 16 3-pointers in the six games , the most by any player off the bench in any Finals. Robert (\u2018Big Shot Bob\u2019) Horry and J.R. Smith had held the record with 15. He scored 84 points, finishing short of just five others in Finals history. The great Manu Ginobili, for instance, never chipped in as many when he was subbing in for San Antonio\u2019s title teams. And VanVleet scored 12 points in the final quarter of a clinching game that was, for all practical purposes, decided by one point. No one else on the floor Thursday night scored more than five in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s not forget, either, VanVleet\u2019s defensive work in rendering Steph Curry as something less than combustible by the series\u2019 end. Leonard, the MVP, would have been scoreless in nine minutes in the fourth if not for his cushion free throws with 0.9 seconds left. Honestly, the taciturn small forward wasn\u2019t an obvious MVP pick in Game 5 or Game 6. But his body of work in the series \u2013 28.5 ppg, 9.8 rpg, 4.2 apg \u2013 made his case early. So, unofficially, did his play across four playoff rounds: 30.5 ppg, 14 games of 30 points or more and 732 points overall in Toronto\u2019s 24 games as the Raptors went 16-8. It was good to see, too, that Leonard played in every one of his team\u2019s postseason contests, which means Toronto got 84 games out of him this season. Fact is, for a lot of sports fans, numbers are the first thing they enjoy. And there were several interesting ones, including: The value of grabbing missed shots wasn\u2019t lost on the Finals MVP. Leonard, in fact, took a trip down memory lane when asked about Curry\u2019s potential game-winning 3-pointer at 111-110 with eight seconds left. The ball ticked out toward the key and Leonard was in the middle of a scramble for the loose ball. By the time Green claimed it \u2013 and called a timeout his team didn\u2019t have \u2013 only 0.9 seconds remained. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like it was a good shot,\u201d Leonard said. That had him in rebound mode. \u201cI\u2019ve been in situations like that in a Finals that I lost by two or three points, and we lost that game because of rebounds. I forgot who shot the ball, you guys know the story. It was the last two possessions for Miami, they got \u2026 four chances at the basket out of two possessions.\u201d Well, yeaaaah . That was Game 6 in 2013, the Heat vs. Leonard\u2019s Spurs. LeBron James got to reload on one 3-pointer, and then Chris Bosh\u2019s rebound of a James miss enabled him to feed Ray Allen for arguably the most memorable shot in Finals history. \u201cAnd that was my fault because I was trying to get the rebound,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cAnd once he missed the ball I tried to keep tipping it so some more time could run out. Didn\u2019t want to grab it right away so they could foul me.\u201d That last part, right there, is basketball genius. Leonard knew Golden State was in more trouble if he didn\u2019t claim the offensive rebound than if he did. Don\u2019t go by this summer\u2019s free agency shoporama. The Raptors aren\u2019t set up with their payroll or roster to be big players when the market opens June 30 this time around. But anyone who paid any attention to the 2019 Finals has to come away thinking Toronto \u2013 as a team, as an organization, as a city, as a fan base \u2013 ought to be one of the most appealing of the NBA\u2019s 30, in terms of a player making his professional home there. The Raptors\u2019 camaraderie and bond was evident on the court and off through all four playoff rounds. Coach Nick Nurse seems respected and liked by his players, and guard Kyle Lowry told the story more than once that he recalled Nurse yelling at them in the locker room only twice all season. Mostly he guided, instructed, cajoled and showed them ways to go from good to better and from better to best, while serving as a role model for coaches in basketball\u2019s nether world dreaming of the big time. \u201cMy job is to get those guys to max out what they can do, get them to play together, get them to play tough defense, get them to share the ball and get them to handle adversity with some calmness and handle triumph with some calmness,\u201d Nurse said before the clincher, in his self-effacing way. \u201cThen you got to look at who you\u2019re playing and you got to try to figure it out. I was telling somebody today, I said\u2026 \u2018Jesus, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to beat these guys.\u2019 And then you say \u2018God, there\u2019s got to be a way we can figure it out.\u2019 In two sentences you go from one end to the other and that\u2019s what the job is.\u201d VanVleet showed class in his institutional memory, giving shout-outs from the postgame podium to team members who had helped get the Raptors to the brink of their championship, including DeMar DeRozan, Jonas Valanciunas, Jakob Poeltl, Delon Wright and coach Dwane Casey. Obviously Ujiri showed the guts to make major moves, adding not just Leonard but Danny Green in that trade and acquiring Marc Gasol during the season. The scene outside Scotiabank Arena was remarkable, the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d throngs that assembled for outdoor videoboard viewings of each game demonstrating a passion and loyalty you don\u2019t routinely see around Madison Square Garden or Staples Center. Sure, there are small hassles to playing and living in another country. International players don\u2019t seem to mind the adjustments \u2013 they\u2019ve already made bigger ones coming to North America, period \u2013 but those born in the U.S. sometimes seem stymied by clearing customs, by the exchange rate, by having to spell defense with a \u201cc\u201d and center by flopping the last two letters. As for as a world capital for the modern age, though, Toronto is a poster place. \u201cJust having guys from different countries and speaking different languages, I think it kind of got us closer together,\u201d forward Pascal Siakam said, sitting afterward draped in the flag of his native Cameroon. \u201cAnd you kind of have all those little kind of friendship with guys that you can speak the same language with, and from Spanish to French to English, different cultures. And I think kind of it represents Toronto in general, having that diversity.\u201d Said Gasol: \u201cYou look at the young players that [we] have, you see the coaching staff, their mindset, you look at the front office. Go from top to bottom, ownership, the trainers, physical therapists, chefs, everything. It\u2019s a top-class organization. They\u2019re all about winning. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re going to win, but it does help that everyone has that championship mentality.\u201d The Raptors and their fans are overdue, then, to lure players a cut above helpers such as Hedo Turkoglu, Jose Calderon, Bismack Biyombo, Tracy Murray or James Johnson. Everything is in place to attract top free agents, better than they\u2019ve signed in the past, if only the players, their agents and their families will embrace basketball without borders as well as the league has. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

After the game Thursday against the Golden State Warriors, Ujiri was denied access to the court by the deputy because he didn\u2019t have a proper credential, Alameda County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThat\u2019s when he tried to push past our deputy, and our deputy pushed him back, and there was another push that kind of moved up and struck our deputy in the face,\u201d Kelly said, who later added the deputy involved complained of pain in his jaw and was taken to a hospital for evaluation. Several bystanders intervened and Ujiri got onto the court without displaying any credentials, Kelly said. Deputies later took witness statements and obtained video of the incident, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be submitting a report to the Alameda County district attorney for complaint of battery on an officer,\u201d he said. Warriors fan Greg Wiener said he was standing next to the deputy when the encounter occurred and did not see Ujiri strike him in the face. \u201cThe thing about the cops saying the policeman asked for his credentials, that didn\u2019t happen. There was no conversation at all,\u201d Wiener said. \u201cThis part about striking him in the face, yeah that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he added. Wiener said the encounter began when the deputy put his hand on Ujiri\u2019s chest and pushed him. Ujiri shoved him back before bystanders intervened, Wiener said, adding that he has not been interviewed by authorities. \u201cThis looks like somebody trying to embellish what happened to protect what they did, what the policeman did,\u201d he said. A video of the altercation obtained by NBC Bay Area shows Ujiri and a deputy being held back courtside by several bystanders. It doesn\u2019t show a scuffle. The video appeared to show Ujiri holding some type of credential in his right hand while standing by the court. The Raptors said in a statement to The Associated Press that the team is also looking into the altercation. \u201cThe incident is being looked at, and we are cooperating with authorities,\u201d the team said. \u201cWe look forward to resolving the situation.\u201d Ujiri had watched the end of the game on television with other team officials outside the Raptors\u2019 locker room. He then went down a tunnel to join the on-court celebration, ESPN reported. The NBA requires extra credentials to gain access to the floor when the series is clinched, including a gold armband. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the league was cooperating with authorities. \u201cWe are in contact with the Raptors and local authorities and in the process of gathering more information,\u201d Bass said. Kelly, the sheriff\u2019s spokesman, did not immediately return a phone message seeking further comment from the AP. Last week, the NBA banned Golden State Warriors investor Mark Stevens from games for a year and fined him $500,000 after he was seen on camera apparently shoving Toronto star Kyle Lowry during Game 3 of the playoffs. Lowry had dived into a row of courtside seats in an effort to save a loose ball. Stevens, wearing an NBA-issued credential, was seated about two spots away from where Lowry landed and shoved Lowry in the upper body. Lowry said Stevens repeated a vulgar phrase to him about four times during the brief incident. The Warriors said later in a statement that the team and Stevens \u201coffer our sincere apology to Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors organization for this unfortunate misconduct.\u201d"},{"id":33201,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/masai-ujiri-kawhi-leonard-raptors-championship","date":"2019-06-14","title":"Redeemed and restored Masai-and-Kawhi combo lead Raptors to 2019 title","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Twice in their short time together, Masai Ujiri and Kawhi Leonard felt the need to bond with an embrace. The first was last summer when they met , the gambling team president greeting the star forward with the wounded reputation. It was welcoming and friendly enough, but not much more meaningful than an obligatory bro hug. Oh, but the second time? This came after the Toronto Raptors clinched their first title with a 114-110 win in Game 6 of The Finals against the Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena. This squeeze was deep and rich and emotional. And tight. As they grabbed each other on the court, you couldn\u2019t slide a piece of fallen confetti between them. Their roles, along with their basketball lives, were instantly changed at that moment. Ujiri was now fully redeemed for making a risky trade, one that fortified a franchise and energized an entire country. And Leonard? He was now a champion and a Finals MVP once more , reputation restored. Masai and Kawhi. The crowning achievement of the 2019 NBA champions began with names that rhymed and a relationship that happened right on time. \u201cIt\u2019s about the players and the coaches,\u201d Ujiri said, deflecting credit. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what decisions we make. Once those are done, now we have to play. And these players played their butts off. And the ownership has to give us the opportunity. There are hundreds of moves that we made that could\u2019ve been mistakes, and moves we made that we thank God we didn\u2019t make. The ones we made, the players and the coaches made them work.\u201d The Raptors accomplished the unexpected by taking advantage of a two-time defending champion that shattered in pieces before everyone\u2019s stunned eyes. Two days after the Warriors lost superstar Kevin Durant with a torn Achilles, they were horrified again when Klay Thompson \u2014 who sent a chill through Toronto with 30 points through three quarters \u2014 landed awkwardly in the fourth Thursday and tore his left anterior cruciate ligament . It was a one-two punch to the gut that the shortchanged Warriors couldn\u2019t survive, though not by the lack of trying. Motivated by those key injuries and also the final game ever inside the 53-year-old arena , the Warriors scrapped until the final seconds. Not until Stephen Curry\u2019s hopeful 3-pointer missed was the threat from Golden State was over. Suddenly, the Raptors would breathe easy. Those three 3-pointers from backup guard Fred VanVleet in the fourth quarter were not in vain. The steady hand of Kyle Lowry (26 points, 10 assists, three steals) was not wasted. And the 26 points from Pascal Siakam proved that a youngster could indeed stay composed and produce in the moment of truth. Game 6 ended the series, and while history might suggest the healthier team instead of the better team won this title, the Raptors did what champions do: They pounced on the opportunity and sealed the deal. Most importantly, they put themselves in position for this to happen by doing what few others would. Discouraged and irritated by the Raptors\u2019 past playoff failures that followed successful regular seasons, Ujiri traded star guard and fan favorite DeMar Derozan for a then-devalued star (Leonard) who went rogue on the San Antonio Spurs. Ujiri felt the need to apologize for acquiring Leonard after feedback in Toronto wasn\u2019t totally supportive. Lowry was enraged by the trade of his close friend and wouldn\u2019t speak to his own team president. Imagine that now. Crazy, right? Ujiri and Leonard were straightforward and frank in their initial discussions about their goal, their only goal. \u201cWhen I was there on my opening day meeting, I said I was focused on the now, and I wanted to make history here, and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI\u2019m still playing basketball no matter what jersey I have on. I just came in with the right mindset: Let\u2019s go out and win games. I texted Kyle the day later and said let\u2019s go out and do something special, that I know your best friend left and I know you\u2019re mad, but let\u2019s make this thing work out. And here we are today.\u201d Leonard proved to be the singular star the Raptors needed to clear the final hurdle. He was a tornado through much of the playoffs, taking the big shots, excelling at both ends of the floor all while pushing the Raptors into a foreign month of the playoffs for them: June. In The Finals, he remained a pain for the Warriors despite their constant double-teams. There he was slashing for baskets, stepping back for jumpers and floating on help on defense (mainly on Curry and Thompson). He averaged 28.5 points, 9.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game in The Finals, clinching his second Finals MVP (to go with his 2014 trophy ). In NBA history, only one other offseason trade compares where a player arrived and instantly made this much of a ripple. In the summer of 1982, Moses Malone priced himself out of Houston, so the Rockets traded him to the Sixers . Philadelphia, at that point, was 0-4 in The Finals with Julius Erving leading the way. Malone proved to be the missing piece as he won MVP and Finals MVP honors in 1982-83 as the Sixers swept the Los Angeles Lakers in The Finals . In 2007, t he Lakers swung a mid-season deal for Pau Gasol to get help for Kobe Bryant. While they advanced to The Finals , L.A. didn\u2019t win the NBA title until 2009 . The difference with Toronto is Leonard wasn\u2019t blessed with teammates with Hall of Fame credentials as Erving and Bryant, and won anyway. The team built by Ujiri was strikingly lacking in top-shelf talent as no player was taken in the Draft lottery . Only Lowry, Leonard and Marc Gasol (who was acquired in at midseason ) had All-Star backgrounds, and Lowry was inherited from the previous regime. The Raptors are therefore one of the more unassuming champions, yet they put themselves here by going scorched Earth through the Eastern Conference playoffs and doing what was necessary against the Warriors. Wayne Embry, a Raptors advisor and former long-time Cleveland Cavaliers executive, said few if any general managers would\u2019ve pulled the trigger on the Leonard trade because of the circumstances surrounding his free agency. \u201cThe thing that really impressed me about Masai was the willingness to make bold decisions,\u201d Embry said. \u201cObviously it paid off. A lot of people worry about job security in those situations. This is a high-risk, high-reward situation that he took advantage of. I commend him and I also commend ownership for going along with it. So here we are, world champions.\u201d This time last summer, Leonard felt alienated and betrayed by the Spurs. He was hurt that the basketball world questioned the severity of his quad injury, which held him to nine games in 2017-18 . The situation was compounded by his quiet nature as he refused to explain himself. That only fed public speculation about his health and motivation. He came to Toronto in a twisted state. \u201cMe just going through that, I just knew that I would have to make myself happy and no one else,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI have to trust myself. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else has to say about me. That was my goal and my focus. I know who I am as a person. \u201cLast summer was rough. I was going through a lot. I was still rehabbing. I told myself I would be back. I wasn\u2019t going to come back until I could be the player I am today. I wanted to come back in the same shape and form without playing five games and re-injuring something. Just to be able to win this championship is something special for me, because you know how people were looking at me last year, and I stayed true to myself. I\u2019m just happy my hard work paid off.\u201d Helped by minutes and games restriction during the regular season, Leonard didn\u2019t miss a playoff game. He averaged 34.1 minutes per game in the first round, 39.7 in the conference semifinals, 41.3 in the conference finals and 40.5 in The Finals. \u201cHe\u2019s unbelievably good,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cHe\u2019s been showing that all year. And he\u2019s Finals MVP again.\u201d After falling behind 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals , the Raptors only lost twice again and took three straight at Oracle. At various points, they were lifted by Lowry \u2014 a point guard dogged by previous playoff failures \u2014 and Siakam, VanVleet and Serge Ibaka. A basketball team is the toast of a hockey nation. \u201cThey always believed in themselves,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThis the real world champions, right? That includes all around the world? Well, a team from Canada now represents that.\u201d The foundation was laid when Leonard requested a trade from the Spurs. Ujiri, with no assurances that Leonard would stay beyond this summer when he hits free agency, put his reputation and the future of his club on the line anyway. All for the sake of making history. After six games of these Finals, we can finally reach a conclusion about that decision. \u201cIt all worked out,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe\u2019re champions.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Thompson injured the knee late in the third quarter of Golden State\u2019s 114-110 loss to the Raptors on Thursday night as Toronto won Canada\u2019s first NBA title. Durant had surgery a day earlier after he was injured during Game 5, when he returned from more than a month out with a strained right calf. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough in terms of a guy like Klay that left it all out there,\u201d Stephen Curry said after the game. \u201cHe was playing amazing tonight. And to see a freak play like that where he lands awkwardly. I don\u2019t know the diagnosis yet, but you think about the person and the guy and how much he loves to play the game and that\u2019s the only thoughts you have. It\u2019s really not about what it means in terms of playing basketball. It\u2019s just I\u2019m more concerned about him as an individual.\u201d Thompson was injured after being fouled by Toronto\u2019s Danny Green and landing awkwardly on a breakaway dunk attempt with 2:22 left in the third quarter as the Warriors, down 3-2, fought to keep their season alive. He fell and immediately grabbed his left knee, writhing on the court in obvious pain as Golden State\u2019s medical staff raced out to provide attention. Thompson was helped off the court, then returned briefly to shoot a pair of free throws before limping back off. He was seen jogging in the hallways of Oracle Arena on his way to the Warriors\u2019 dressing room but was eventually ruled out. Thompson was later shown leaving Oracle on crutches. He finished the game with 30 points. \u201cHe might be the toughest guy I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d center Kevon Looney said. \u201cI know he was in a lot of pain when he went down. I\u2019ve never seen him scream or show emotion like that, so I knew he was hurt. He\u2019s a tough guy and came back and made the free throws.\u201d The All-Star shooting guard had missed Golden State\u2019s 123-109 loss in Game 3 with a sore left hamstring. Golden State missed out on a three-peat playing in its fifth straight NBA Finals, having won three of the previous four championships. Now, Durant and Thompson \u2014 who both could become free agents \u2014 are in for lengthy recoveries. \u201cWhen Klay goes down and is out for the game, it\u2019s just sort of a, \u2018You got to be kidding me. Like, this has to stop,\u201d\u2018 coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just the way it\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to five straight seasons of playing a 100-plus games and just all the wear and tear, but it\u2019s devastating.\u201d Recovery times vary, but ACL tears typically take roughly six months to rehab, with additional time after that to regain full strength and mobility. Thompson made both free throw attempts, pushing his point total to 30 on just 12 shot attempts. Even with those foul shots, the Raptors outscored the Warriors 34-25 after he was hurt. Thompson\u2019s injury came on the heels of a nightmare Game 5 for the Warriors, who won the game but lost Kevin Durant for the remainder of the series and beyond with a torn Achilles tendon. Durant had missed roughly a month before that with a strained calf. Recovery times vary, but ACL tears typically take roughly six months to rehab, with additional time after that to regain full strength and mobility. Should Durant and Thompson miss all of next season (and they remain in Golden State), the Warriors would be the first team since 1977-78 to have two of its top three scorers miss the following season. In the 1978-79 season, the Boston Celtics were without John Havlicek (the team\u2019s No. 2 scorer) and Dave Bing (the No. 3 scorer) after they both retired in the summer of 1978.

The Raptors finished the series off with a 114-110 victory in Game 6, their third win in nine days at Oracle Arena. The Raptors had four players \u2014 Kyle Lowry (26), Pascal Siakam (26), Kawhi Leonard (22) and Fred VanVleet (22) \u2014 score 22 or more points in the clincher, another efficient offensive performance against the defending champs. After scoring 110 points per 100 possessions or more in only five of their first 15 playoff games, the Raptors scored 110 per 100 or better in eight of their last nine , with Game 2 of The Finals being the only exception. One stat stood out from the rest as the Raptors brought home Canada\u2019s first major championship since 1993. 53 percent: Fred VanVleet\u2019s 3-point percentage over the Raptors\u2019 last nine playoff games and since his son, Fred Jr. was born. That\u2019s 30 makes on 57 attempts, a remarkable turnaround for the undrafted VanVleet, who had shot 6-for-42 (including 3-for-24 from 3-point range) over his previous nine games . In Game 4 of the conference semifinals in Philadelphia, a game the Raptors needed to avoid a 3-1 deficit in the series, VanVleet played just seven minutes. He continued to struggle with his shot through Game 3 of the conference finals. But the 6-footer gave the Raptors some important minutes in that double-overtime victory over Milwaukee after Kyle Lowry fouled out midway through the fourth quarter, and his one make (on 11 attempts) was a big 3-pointer late in regulation . Then, on May 20, the day between Games 3 and 4, Fred Jr. was born. VanVleet returned home to Illinois for the birth and then got back to Toronto for Game 4, having barely slept. In Game 4, VanVleet shot 5-for-6, draining all three of his 3-point attempts. Two nights later, VanVleet was 7-for-9 from beyond the arc in a huge Game 5 victory in Milwaukee, after which he offered the quote of the night when asked about his recent success: \u201cZero sleep, have a lot of babies, and go out there and let loose.\u201d The hot streak, which included a plethora of big shots, continued through Game 6 of The Finals, when VanVleet scored 22 points ( his high in 37 career playoff games ). He was 6-for-14 from the field, including 5-for-11 from beyond the arc. Three of those five 3s, along with a trio free throws after being fouled by Shaun Livingston on a 3-point attempt, came in the fourth quarter. The first two both came with just two seconds left on the shot clock. The first was a relatively clean pull-up from the left wing that tied the game at 91 with just over nine minutes to go. The second was a contested 3 (again from the left wing) over Stephen Curry that put the Raptors up one with a little more than seven minutes to go. The last of VanVleet\u2019s 22 points came on the shot that gave the Raptors the lead for good. With a little less than four minutes to go, he got a high screen from Siakam. And when the Warriors\u2019 defenders \u2014 Quinn Cook and Draymond Green \u2014 each went with Siakam\u2019s roll to the rim, VanVleet calmly stepped back into a 3 from the top of the arc. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP. But the Raptors don\u2019t win this championship if not for the remarkable turnaround from Fred VanVleet. The biggest shots in Game 6, along with some other huge buckets over the last nine games, came from the smallest man on the floor.

It\u2019s amazing to think that the Raptors were a possession or two away from being down 3-1 to Philadelphia, a possession or two away from losing Game 7 in that same series, and a possession or two away from being down 3-0 to Milwaukee. Most title teams have pivotal moments like that, but this Raptors run was special, especially given their recent history of playoff disappointment. There were multiple opportunities for \u201cSame ol\u2019 Raptors\u201d moments. But instead of folding, this team stood strong in the face of pressure. And though there were plenty of offensive heroics from Kawhi Leonard and others, the Raptors mostly came through with terrific team defense. \u201cI think if your team puts down a foundation of defense,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said along the way, \u201cyou put yourself in position to win most nights.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at six of the key wins along the way that boosted the Raptors to their first NBA championship. NBA.com\/Stats video box score:  Raptors 111, Magic 82 It\u2019s not typical for a 4-1 series between the No. 2 and 7 seeds to have a pivotal moment. But the Raptors lost another Game 1, treating it like a regular-season game in the eyes of coach Nick Nurse. \u201cIt took one punch in the gut from the Orlando Magic to understand we\u2019d better start playing a lot harder,\u201d Nurse would say later. \u201cI think we came out in Game 2 and you saw a totally different basketball team.\u201d Game 1 was kind of an ugly game on both ends of the floor, but the Raptors\u2019 managed to make Game 2 even tougher for the Magic offense. Statistically, it was the Raptors second-best defensive game of the season (82 points allowed on 94 possessions). Key stat: Live ball turnovers: Magic 10, Raptors 2 Key sequence:  First quarter, 12:00 \u2013 7:43 . Though Game 1 was low-scoring overall, the Magic pulled it out by scoring 20 points on their final 11 possessions, turning a six-point deficit into a three-point victory. In Game 2, Orlando went scoreless on its first nine possessions, turning the ball over four times (with Marc Gasol stripping D.J. Augustin and Jonathan Isaac the first two times the Magic had the ball) and shooting 0-for-6. The Raptors never trailed, led by as many as 34 points, and would go on to win four straight games after that. \u201cI thought we learned our lesson from that Game 1 against Orlando,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWe ripped off about six tough-ass, hard-playing games. I think six in a row, and then took a step back in Game 3 in Philly.\u201d Indeed, from Game 2 of the first round through Game 2 of the conference semis, the Raptors ran off six straight games in which they limited their opponent to less than a point per possession. But Game 2 of the Philadelphia series was their worst offensive game of the postseason. With the Sixers changing defensive assignments (putting Ben Simmons on Leonard and Joel Embiid on Pascal Siakam), the Raptors scored just 38 points in the first half. Leonard finished with 35 on 13-for-24 from the floor, but his teammates shot a combined 20-for-66 (30 percent). Then in Game 3 in Philly, the Raptors got waxed . And to add injury to insult, Siakam suffered a bruised calf when he tried to trip Embiid early in the fourth quarter. NBA.com\/Stats video box score:  Raptors 101, Sixers 96 Game 4 in Philadelphia was, arguably, the most important game in the Raptors\u2019 run. After losing by 21 in Game 3, they needed to get a win on the road to avoid a 3-1 deficit. Key stat: The Raptors outscored the Sixers 33-11 in 12:46 with Embiid off the floor. Key sequence:  Fourth quarter, 9:00 \u2013 3:00 . The Sixers led by three after Jimmy Butler drained a 3-pointer with 9:18 to go in the fourth. But the Raptors would hold them to just one point over their next nine possessions. \u201cTheir defense,\u201d said Sixers coach Brett Brown afterward, \u201cwent up a new level.\u201d For the first time since the acquisition of Gasol, Nurse played his two centers \u2013 Gasol and Serge Ibaka \u2013 together for extended minutes . In fact, they played together for almost all of what was a pivotal fourth quarter, with Ibaka getting a key block on Tobias Harris and Gasol hitting one of the biggest shots of the season, a 3-pointer to tie the game with 7:08 left. The Sixers were back within one with just over a minute to go when Leonard got a screen from Gasol with just four seconds left on the shot clock. Embiid switched onto Leonard, who stepped back behind the 3-point line and rose up for what was the biggest shot of the Raptors\u2019 season to date.               \u201cI looked up at the shot clock and tried to create as much space as possible,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI just took a shot and believed it would go in.\u201d But the Raptors would need another one of those, because the teams split Games 5 and 6, with the home team winning each game comfortably. NBA.com\/Stats video box score:  Raptors 92, Sixers 90 There\u2019s nothing better than a Game 7 that goes down to the wire. And this one went all the way down. Key stat: The Sixers totaled just six second-chance points, after averaging 12.5 through the first six games. Key sequence:  Fourth quarter, 3:15 \u2013 1:10 . With the score tied after a 5-0 run from Philly, the Raptors came up with three of the best defensive possessions (for any team) in this postseason. The first was five players on a string and working hard\u2026 Gasol making the initial entry pass tough and then hedging an Embiid-J.J. Redick dribble handoff, Ibaka rotating out to Embiid, Gasol meeting Embiid\u2019s drive with help, Leonard rotating down to Ibaka\u2019s man, and Siakam rotating over to Leonard\u2019s man in the weakside corner. That was Butler, who tried to get the ball back to Embiid, but there was no time left on the shot clock. With the score still tied on the Sixers\u2019 next possession, they set three different ball screens for Butler, but he still couldn\u2019t shake loose, and Gasol forced him into an impossible, step-back 3-point attempt at the shot-clock buzzer. After Leonard put the Raptors ahead by two with another jumper over Embiid , the Raptors locked the Sixers down one last time. Siakam denied an entry to Harris in the post, Lowry denied a handoff to Redick, and then Siakam denied another handoff to Harris. Embiid finally got the ball to Harris, but the forward was then 30 feet from the basket with less than five seconds left on the shot clock. Siakam and Gasol trapped him and when he tried to get the ball back to Embiid, Lowry came off his man to steal the ball and lead a break that put the Raptors up four. Three offensive possessions for a Philadelphia lineup that scored 116.2 points per 100 possessions this season (regular season and playoffs combined), and the ball never even got to the rim. \u201cThere are some stretches where it\u2019s darned hard to complete a pass against us,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThat wears into a team after a while when you\u2019re up into them and you\u2019re denying and everybody is just that connected and playing that hard.\u201d Of course, the Sixers managed to tie the game with 4.2 seconds left. And that, of course, led to one last Kawhi Leonard shot over Joel Embiid \u2026 It was the first Game 7, buzzer-beating game-winner in NBA history. And it took four bounces for it to go in. \u201cYou\u2019re within that moment,\u201d Leonard would say about pressure situations, \u201cYou\u2019re embracing it and enjoying what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d It\u2019s still not clear that the Raptors were the better team in that series. But all that matters is they were the team that won four of seven games. NBA.com\/Stats video box score:  Raptors 118, Bucks 112 (2OT) The Milwaukee Bucks were the best team in the league in the regular season and racked up a 10-1 playoff record through Game 2 of the conference finals , a wire-to-wire, 22-point win over the Raptors. At that point, 67 of the 72 teams that had taken a 2-0 series lead in the conference finals had gone on to win the series. But the Raptors weren\u2019t daunted. After the Raptors were blown out in Game 2, Leonard was asked a question: Where do you go from here, Kawhi? \u201cI\u2019m going to Toronto,\u201d he replied. \u201cGame 3.\u201d In Toronto, Nurse made the big adjustment of putting Leonard on Kia MVP favorite Giannis Antetokounmpo. But Game 3 wasn\u2019t a clear signal that the series had turned. The Raptors built a 11-point lead in the first quarter, but Milwaukee hung around and came back from five points down with a little more than a minute left in regulation to send the game to overtime. And Lowry had fouled out with more than six minutes to go in the fourth. Key stat: Leonard played a career-high 52:08, despite suffering a leg injury that would keep him somewhat hobbled through the remainder of the postseason less than three minutes into the game. Key sequence:  Second overtime, 2:40 \u2013 0:16 . The Bucks\u2019 only lead since early in the first quarter was after their second possession of the second OT. And that lead lasted only 21 seconds before Gasol hit a big 3-pointer. Still, it was just a one-point game before the Raptors came up with a few more big stops to save their season once again. The biggest was a remarkable defensive play by Leonard . He deflected Khris Middleton\u2019s pass out of the post and then snatched the ball away from Malcolm Brogdon after Brogdon had seemingly beat him to it. He converted the steal into an easy dunk that put the Raptors up three with 1:52 to go. \u201cAny time you can get a steal and a breakout,\u201d Nurse said afterward, \u201cit\u2019s a huge momentum play.\u201d Two possessions later, Siakam rejected Brook Lopez at the rim . And after Leonard put the Raptors up four, their pressure defense forced Milwaukee into a back-court violation that sealed the win. The Raptors trailed Game 5 by 11 points midway through the third quarter and Game 6 by 15 with a little more than two minutes to go in the third. But neither game appeared completely out of hand. And in both cases, they came up with big fourth quarters \u2013 33-24 in Game 5, 29-18 in Game 6 \u2013 to win their first Eastern Conference title. It\u2019s hard to determine which win was more important, the one on the road or the one that sent them to The Finals after it was looking like we were heading back to Milwaukee for a Game 7. Key stat: Leonard, who never had more than eight assists in 570 career games prior to Game 5, had 16 assists total in Games 5 and 6. That number speaks to Leonard\u2019s reading of the Milwaukee defense, but also the revival of his supporting cast. Fred VanVleet, who had shot 6-for-42 over a nine-game stretch from Game 2 of the conference semis through Game 3 of the conference finals, hit the biggest shot of Game 5, a right-wing 3 off a kick-out from Leonard that gave the Raptors the lead for good with 2:19 left. Key sequence: Game 6, Third quarter, 2:10 \u2013 fourth quarter, 6:45 . If it weren\u2019t for Leonard\u2019s buzzer-beater against Philly, the 26-3 run that turned a 15-point deficit into an eight-point lead in Game 6 would be the defining moment of the Raptors\u2019 run to The Finals. The exclamation point was Leonard\u2019s incredible left-handed dunk on Antetokounmpo on a fast break which started with a Lowry steal. There was still work to be done after that, but the Raptors had found another way to fight through a tough spot. Just winning the East felt like a championship in Toronto. You could hear it in the crowd and you could see it in Lowry\u2019s smile in the final seconds of Game 6. But the Raptors were not done. After the Warriors took home-court advantage with a win in Game 2, Nurse told his team that they just needed to get one of the next two games in Oakland. \u201c[Expletive] that,\u201d was Leonard\u2019s response, per Nurse. \u201cLet\u2019s go get them both.\u201d With Klay Thompson out, Game 3 was relatively academic. But Game 4, with Thompson scoring 28 points on 11-for-18 shooting, was a much tougher go. Key stat: The Warriors scored 92 points on 95 possessions, their worst offensive game of the playoffs . Key sequence:  Third quarter, 12:00 \u2013 11:10 . The second half began with the Warriors up four with the ball. Siakam switched onto Thompson, stayed in front of him, and forced him to give up the ball. After Andre Iguodala missed a 3, VanVleet pushed the ball up in transition and found Leonard on the right wing for a catch-and-shoot 3 that rattled in. Seven seconds later, Draymond Green dropped Stephen Curry\u2019s entry pass. Leonard grabbed the ball, dribbled up the floor, and drained another 3 in Green\u2019s grill. The tide really turned with an 18-3 Toronto run late in the third quarter, but those two 3-pointers from Leonard were a clear sign that the Raptors weren\u2019t going to be victimized by one of those game-changing third quarters from the Warriors. \u201cKawhi Leonard came out and hit two big \u2018eff-you\u2019 shots to start the half,\u201d VanVleet said afterward. \u201cThere\u2019s no defense for that. There are no schemes for that. That\u2019s two big-boy shots that he came out of the half with, two back-to-back 3s. And that just kind of let you know how we were going to approach the third quarter and the rest of the half. It put us in good position.\u201d Though the Raptors had gained home-court advantage with their win in Game 3, there\u2019s a big difference between a 2-2 series and a 3-1 series. Given the circumstances, Game 4 was arguably the Raptors\u2019 most impressive win in the postseason. And it put them on the brink of their first championship. That title came six days later, back in Oakland, where the Warriors had lost just three times over their previous seven series. That the Raptors won three games at Oracle Arena in the span of nine days says a lot about their toughness. \u201cThis is a strong minded, tough-ass group of guys,\u201d Nurse said just before his team went out and won Game 6 of the Finals. \u201cIt really is.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Kawhi Leonard has just moved into your Finals neighborhood. Leonard delivered the Toronto Raptors to their first championship on Thursday, posting 22 points, six rebounds and three assists to power a 114-110 win over the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of The Finals. Leonard was dominant in the series, averaging 28.5 points, 9.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.2 steals.  Those efforts helped Leonard secure the Bill Russell Finals MVP Award for the second time in his career. His first came as a member of the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 championship squad in 2014. In winning a second with the Raptors, he joins Abdul-Jabbar and James as the only players to earn Finals MVPs with two different franchises. Here\u2019s a look at how each of them stacked up in their Finals MVP runs: (Note: Blocks per game not an official NBA stat until 1973-74 season.) Aside from that honor, Leonard also becomes the 12th player in NBA history to win two or more Finals MVP awards overall in their career. Of the 11 previous players on that list, seven of them are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
