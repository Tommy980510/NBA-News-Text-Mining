Ariza had words with injured Austin Rivers near the Clippers\u2019 bench as time wound down in their 113-102 victory over the visiting Rockets. Clearly incensed, Ariza had to be repeatedly prevented from confronting Rivers before he and Clippers forward Blake Griffin were assessed with technical fouls and ejected. \/\/\/ Emotions were already running high with Chris Paul, now a member of the Houston Rockets, returning to Staples Center on MLK Day, so it came as little surprise that things would get chippy. The LA Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin and Rockets\u2019 Trevor Ariza were ejected late in the fourth quarter of the Clippers\u2019 113-102 win , but things reportedly got even more heated after the game. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, members of the Rockets attempted to enter the Clippers\u2019 locker room through a back entrance and were held back by security. Per Wojnarowski, Houston\u2019s Trevor Ariza, James Harden and Chris Paul entered through a back corridor at Staples Center and sought to confront the Clippers\u2019 Austin Rivers and Blake Griffin. Rockets guard Gerald Green also joined Ariza, Harden and Paul and in the connecting hallway and breached the entrance of the Clippers\u2019 locker room. As the Clippers were celebrating their win, Wojnarowski reports, they leaped to their feet after realizing that four Rockets players had come calling for them. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on what happened next : According to Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times , Rockets center Clint Capela stood outside the Clippers\u2019 locker room but could not get in as well. Things got testy with 3 1\/2 minutes to go. Griffin scored under the basket and Paul was called for a foul. Paul ran over to the referees in disbelief, while Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni appeared to unleash a stream of expletives in Griffin\u2019s direction. The referees reviewed video of the play and confirmed the foul on Paul, while also assessing double technicals to Griffin and D\u2019Antoni. The crowd was on its feet with 1:12 to go after Griffin caught the ball near the midcourt sideline and slammed it off Eric Gordon\u2019s back in order to keep it from going out of bounds. Nine seconds later, Griffin and Trevor Ariza, who was jawing with Austin Rivers, received double technicals after exchanging words, and both were ejected.

No, not literally. But the coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers had used the familiar call of duty to describe the suddenness with which a game against the Golden State Warriors can turn. And sure enough, on Monday night at Quicken Loans Arena , it turned on Lue and his team. \u201cThey\u2019re the only team,\u201d Lue told reporters before tipoff, \u201cwhere you can be looking at the game and it\u2019s a two-point game. You go to the bathroom, come back, they\u2019re up 15.\u201d Lue\u2019s \u201cloo\u201d moment, figuratively anyway, came after David West sank two free throws to put the Warriors up 95-93 with 9:07 to play. There it was \u2013 the two-point lead \u2013 in what had been 39 minutes of mostly entertaining, back-and-forth, you-loved-them-then-you\u2019ll-love-them-again basketball between the familiar adversaries. Exactly 3 minutes 23 seconds later, Draymond Green cut to the basket, took a pass from Shaun Livingston and dropped in a layup that made it 105-95 . It was the biggest lead of the night to that point. Lue twice had called timeouts during the run in an attempt to stop the bleeding. Now there was only 5:44 left. The Warriors\u2019 margin would grow to 14. And the Cavaliers, to stick with Lue\u2019s imagery, were circling the bowl. That the defending champions can go into hyperdrive against anybody is a reminder, not a revelation. But there were some things revealed, discovered and learned in the second and final regular-season clash of the respective West and East favorites, including: Isaiah Thomas has a way to go. This was our most extended look yet at Cleveland\u2019s new point guard, their Kyrie Irving replacement, in circumstances most like those he\u2019ll face when the meat of the Cavs\u2019 schedule \u2013 the postseason \u2013 rolls around. Thomas scored 19 points, matching his high from the four previous games he played. He was on the floor for 32 minutes, nearly eight minutes more than his previous high. Both Thomas, who missed the season\u2019s first 11 weeks recovering from a hip injury left over from last spring in Boston, and the Cavaliers know a) he\u2019s not sharp or in great shape yet, and b) neither he nor the team has gotten familiar enough with the other to achieve the best results. Yet Thomas took 21 shots Monday, more than LeBron James (18), more than Dwyane Wade (14) and more than double any other Cleveland player. He made just eight, including just one of his seven 3-point attempts. Lue, though, said he had no problem with Thomas\u2019 gunning, as long as they were good shots. Thomas sounded as if he was seeking out work where he could find it. Granted, it was his hip that kept him out but his elbow, wrist and shooting hand apparently profit from heavy usage now too. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get in shape,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my legs back. Especially when I get a little winded, my legs get even heavier. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s gonna help me is getting reps. Running up and down the floor. Getting my hip, getting my body accustomed to taking a beating. \u2026 Getting in basketball shape.\u201d Kevin Durant didn\u2019t put much stock in Thomas\u2019 play Monday as a sign of how he\u2019ll help Cleveland come springtime. Durant went through a similar enough trial in 2014-15, when surgery in October to repair a Jones fracture in his right foot sidelined him into December, then finally scuttled his season after just 27 games. \u201cObviously IT is just getting back,\u201d the Warriors forward said. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t played in seven months \u2013 you\u2019ve got to give him some time. I know exactly how that feels. Especially being thrown in in the middle of the season and starting and playing 30-plus minutes now \u2026 I know it\u2019s gonna take him a while to get into a comfortable groove here.\u201d What we saw is what we\u2019d get. Mostly. It looked at various points as if both coaches were trying lineups, testing young players, tinkering with substitution patterns or probing matchups with an eye on a possible re-re-rematch in June. Likewise, it would be understandable for Lue and Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr to hold back a few wrinkles, just to have something fresh to try the next time they face each other. \u201dWe don\u2019t hold too much back, to be honest with you,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI think matchups can dictate some things that you do in the playoffs and sometimes you may make a few different play calls, whatever. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a conscious effort to hold anything back for fear of tipping the hand for later.\u201d Kerr started rookie big Jordan Bell again, same as in the Christmas game in Oakland, for more mobility against Cleveland\u2019s small lineup than center Zaza Pachulia would provide. The coach gave Kevon Looney, Nick Young and Patrick McCaw more tastes of the rivalry too. Lue, meanwhile, was asked if he had the Cavaliers target Steph Curry defensively to get him into foul trouble and generally make life difficult. That\u2019s a tactic that has helped when most others have failed against the two-time MVP and it might come in handy down the road. \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d Lue said, pointedly declining to answer. Curry can dunk.  And David West still can. It was a rare Curry-in-flight moment early in the second half when the Golden State guard, who usually does his damage from deep, threw down a two-handed dunk. It was his first of the season. \u201cI think he was taking out some anger from the first half,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSometimes that will get him going. Steph loves to dunk more than anybody, you know that. Doesn\u2019t happen often, so when it does, it jacks him up.\u201d Said Durant, who fed Curry for the slam: \u201cHe surprised me on that one. Hopefully he\u2019s feeling better tomorrow. I know it took a lot for him to get up there.\u201d West got his 37-year-old bones up there too, dunking off the dribble during his nine-minute, plus-nine stint in the fourth quarter. The veteran power forward had missed his three shots in the second.  \u201cHe was a little short on his jump shot to start the game,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut D. West is such a smart player, he makes adjustments, he doesn\u2019t get discouraged. He made a huge play \u2013 his lefthanded dunk kind of got us all going. That was definitely surprising when he turned that one over.\u201d But seriously, Cleveland has issues. Besides losing for the eighth time in 10 games, the Cavaliers had their 13-game home winning streak broken in Monday\u2019s 118-108 loss . And when it was second unit vs. second unit to start the fourth quarter, the Warriors had little trouble switching on defense and crowding away the Cavs\u2019 long-range game. Cleveland shot just 6 of 23 in the fourth quarter , and got outscored 61-44 in what Kerr considered one of his club\u2019s most complete second halves.  The Cavaliers\u2019 defensive leaks have been extensively criticized, and more IT as he gets his game back is not the best way to address those. Even more problematic is the offense now, which over the past few weeks has been grinding, with none of them having much fun with the ball or without. \u201cThis is an important time for us,\u201d Wade said, \u201cand we want to see how we respond coming out of this game. \u2026 It\u2019s not about just winning a ball game. It\u2019s about building good habits as a team.\u201d Given James\u2019 record and reputation \u2013 seven consecutive trips to the Finals, most in spite of some in-season doldrums for his Heat or Cavs crews \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of \u201cIn LeBron We Trust,\u201d both inside and outside the Cleveland locker room. Until a rival in the Eastern Conference proves it can knock off the King, no one will believe it. But if the Cavaliers, after so many exposures to their Bay Area nemeses (9-17 in regular- and postseason meetings since the start of 2014-15), can\u2019t come up with solutions, maybe NBA fans should want to see someone else get a crack at them.

A life given for love. \u201cHe had a vision and he took a bullet for all of us,\u201d James said. As he and the Cavaliers prepared Monday to host the defending champion Golden State Warriors, one of 11 games on the NBA\u2019s holiday schedule, James said honoring King\u2019s memory and message is more vital than ever. \u201cFor us to stand here even though we\u2019re trying to be divided right now by somebody, today is a great day for people to realize how America was built and how we all have to stand united in order to be one,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially as Americans because we believe, we all know and we all believe, this is the greatest country in the world.\u201d That \u201csomebody\u201d James was referring to is President Trump, whom the Cavaliers star has openly criticized in the past. While not saying Trump\u2019s name, James again made he opposes some of the president\u2019s rhetoric. Trump is marking his first King holiday in office buffeted by claims he used a vulgarity to describe African countries and questioned the need to allow more Haitians into the U.S. \u201cThe state of racism will never die, but what we cannot do is allow it to conquer us as people. We can\u2019t allow it to divide us,\u201d said James, the four-time league MVP. \u201cThe guy in control has given people and racism, and negative racism, an opportunity to be out and outspoken without fear. And that\u2019s the fearful thing for us because it\u2019s with you, and it\u2019s around every day. But he\u2019s allowed people to come out and just feel confident about doing negative things. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow that to stop us from continuing to be together and preach the right word of living and loving and laughing and things of that nature. Because would we want to live anywhere else? I don\u2019t think so. We love this place.\u201d James applauded the league\u2019s efforts to promote the legacy of the civil rights leader who was killed 50 years ago on a motel balcony in Memphis, Tennessee. James has visited the site of King\u2019s slaying, calling the experience \u201cvery eerie and powerful.\u201d The father of three said he looks forward to taking his kids there. James says he tries to uphold King\u2019s message of empowerment through his foundation. \u201cI hope I made him proud,\u201d James said. In 2016, James, along with fellow NBA stars and close friends Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony stood on stage at the ESPYs and delivered a speech to raise awareness for social change and action. James has the date \u2013 07 13 2016 \u2013 written on his sneakers as a reminder of the speech. \u201cWe are in a difficult state right now as Americans as well with the leader of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no matter the religion, no matter the shapes and sizes, we all have to continue to come together and shine a brighter light on \u2026 I don\u2019t want to use the word stupidity, but that\u2019s basically what it comes down to. \u201cAnd because we\u2019ve built such an incredible country and for us to be able to live free lives and be able to work and work together, no matter the color of skin tone or things of that nature. Or religion. And we have to continue that and that date, I put it on my shoes because it always reminds me of our conversation. The conversation of how to continue to keep people involved.

League-wide pace is up again. At an average of 99.4 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes, the league is playing at its fastest pace since the 1990-91 season. Twenty of the 30 teams have played at a faster pace than they did last season, when 21 of the 30 teams played faster than they did the season before. The 2005-06, \u201cSeven seconds or less\u201d Phoenix Suns played at a pace that would rank 20th this season . At 106.2 points scored per 100 possessions, 2016-17 was the most efficient scoring season in NBA history, and this season, teams have been slightly more efficient through Game 41 (105.6 points per 100 possessions) than they were last season (105.5). So it\u2019s possible that the league will eventually top that mark of 106.2. At 52.0 percent, effective field goal percentage is already higher than its ever been in any full season. The percentage of shots that have come from 3-point range has seen another big jump, from 32 percent to 34 percent. But we\u2019re also seeing the all-time lowest marks in both offensive rebounding percentage (only 22 percent of available rebounds have been grabbed by the offensive team) and free throw rate (the league is averaging just 26 free throw attempts per 100 shots from the field). Furthermore, after dropping each of the last three seasons (from 15.1 to 14.0 per 100 possessions), league-wide turnover percentage is up to 14.7. That\u2019s still the third lowest rate in the 41 seasons since the league started counting turnovers, though. Pace and space has made it harder to defend the league\u2019s best offenses than it was in years prior. But some teams have done it well. The Minnesota Timberwolves weren\u2019t one of those teams early in the season, but they\u2019ve improved defensively over the last several weeks and have picked up some quality wins along the way.

I needed her. I needed someone, for I was no longer functioning. I was standing on the spot where Martin Luther King, Jr., was murdered. I was sobbing. I had taken the tour at the National Civil Rights Museum (NCRM) before, and walked past rooms 306 and 307 at the Lorraine Motel, what\u2019s left of it, anyway, that part of the motel having been preserved by the museum that was built around it in 1991, a jarring conclusion to the tour. What preceded was moving, but mostly known to anyone who has spent any time reading up or studying the Civil Rights movement, the names and events coming all at once: Parks and Faubus; Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman; Leeb, Evers and Connor; Wells and Hamer and Marshall and Eckford. Montgomery. Selma. Lunch Counters. Freedom Summer. But the tour ends by walking past Rooms 307 and 306 of the Lorraine \u2014 the actual rooms, 306 being where King and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy roomed together on April 3, 1968. The bedspreads, the plates, the cigarette butts \u2014 all preserved from that day, frozen for all time, the rooms a shrine-cum-mausoleum of sorts. But I had not been to the museum in many years, and when I had gone on the tour before, the balcony was closed. In 2012, the museum decided to open the balcony to tourgoers. Thus, I was surprised Sunday when a worker at the museum opened the door to the balcony \u2014 the balcony.  It is a small, narrow balcony. There were only a few of us out there, and it was claustrophobic. Such were the accommodations available for black folks in the \u201860s, and King had stayed at the Lorraine many times between 1966 and 1968. You take three steps onto the balcony, and you are \u2026 there. You are standing where King stood when he spoke to Ben Branch, a musician he knew, who was standing beneath King and his coterie in the courtyard. The group was about to go to the home of Rev. Billy Kyles for dinner. \u201cBen, make sure you play \u2018Take My Hand, Precious Lord\u2019 tonight in the meeting,\u201d King asked Branch. \u201cPlay it real pretty.\u201d Seconds later, a rifle shot rang out. You look up. You see where the tour guide says the FBI believes the shot came from \u2014 a window on the top floor of a boarding house just across from the motel. The window is approximately 207 feet from the balcony. It\u2019s not far, not far at all. And you can now understand the damage that one bullet can do fired from so near its target \u2014 King, who stood where I was standing when the .30-06 caliber rifle struck him in the neck, tore through his jaw, severed his spine and lodged in his shoulder. I began to cry. The museum has preserved one square piece of the original concrete from the balcony that was there in 1968. That square once was stained with King\u2019s blood after the shooting; the square has been cleaned and returned, a gravestone with no name on it, its horrible witness to history having changed the world. I began sobbing. And Cash, one of the greatest basketball players ever, and as nice a person as she was great on the court, and who had her infant son in her arms most of the tour, reached out and put her hand on my shoulder. She said nothing.  The dichotomy between the simplicity of what was preserved of April 3 and 4, 1968, in Rooms 306 and 307 of the Lorraine Motel, and the outsized status and stature of the people who toured the museum in 2018 \u2014 almost all people of color \u2014 was jarring. King came to Memphis to fight for economic improvements for poor people, as part of his nationwide Poor People\u2019s Campaign, the last movement he would head. The people on the tour Sunday, former NBA and WNBA stars, assorted Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizziles, the Commissioner of the NBA and the Executive Director of the National Basketball Players Association, me \u2014 all of us are doing ridiculously well financially compared to almost any other person who\u2019s ever lived. The African-American players of the NBA, 300 to 340 or so, are likely the greatest single collection of black wealth and millionaires on earth. What King fought for and died for seems far removed from so many who star in the NBA, who move tens of millions of dollars worth of shoes and sodas and other products, whose faces are recognized around the world. But, of course, that was the whole point of the civil rights movement \u2014 to give black people the ability to rise or fall on their own abilities and talents, and to make the faces of black people something not to be feared or ordered about, but respected and admired. But we were all here, in Memphis, to help commemorate King\u2019s birthday this morning, and to mark the beginning of events in Memphis marking the 50 years that have passed since the assassination. (\u201cAnniversary\u201d does not seem appropriate here.) We were here because the Grizzlies play here every January 15th, the game only a part of days of events and symposiums throughout the city that celebrate King\u2019s life and look to find modern meaning in his legacy. \u201cThis is our opening night, Christmas Day, all wrapped up into one when it comes to the importance of the game to our organization,\u201d Grizzlies President Jason Wexler said Saturday. The Grizzlies have long understood that they must do more than just roll basketballs out on King\u2019s birthday. They have helped create a local charter school \u2014 Grizzlies Prep \u2014 for 5th through 8th grade boys, primarily in low-income neighborhoods and in communities of color. They\u2019ve invested millions of dollars into local mentoring programs. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley pledged $1 million last year toward the Grizzlies\u2019 TEAM Mentor Program. Their efforts in the city made them a finalist last year \u2014 the only NBA team chosen \u2014 for the Sports Humanitarian Team of the Year Award. Former Coach David Fizdale \u2014 who publicly advocated for the removal of statues of Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederacy President Jefferson Davis from local parks ( both were removed last month ) \u2014 worked with local farms that taught people to grow healthier, locally-grown foods to help reduce the obesity numbers in the city. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v For years, before their MLK Day game, the team has sponsored a civil rights panel discussion, now officially called the Earl Lloyd Sports Legacy Symposium, in honor of the first black player to play in an NBA game (full disclosure: I\u2019ve hosted it several times) at FedEx Forum. The team has honored former players like Oscar Robertson, Dave Bing and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar over the years who have made significant contributions off the court toward improving the lives of people of color. This year\u2019s 16th Celebration Game will again feature the annual Sports Legacy Award presentation and symposium, which will honor Hall of Famer James Worthy, former players Sam Perkins and Cash, and former player and Memphis native Penny Hardaway. And in Monday\u2019s game, the Grizzlies will debut their City Edition uniforms , which come with a wonderful and historic touch: the \u201cMEMPHIS\u201d font on the front of their jerseys is the same font that was used for the iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters and placards that sanitation workers in the city used after they went on strike in the spring of 1968 \u2014 the event that brought Dr. King to Memphis in his last days. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware of our history in this city,\u201d Wexler said. \u201cFedEx Forum, to me, is the greatest address in sports. Our address is 191 Beale Street, and our boundaries are Beale Street ( where the blues took hold as an iconic American music institution), B.B. King Boulevard, Martin Luther King Avenue and Church park, named for Robert Church, who was the first African-American millionaire, post-Civil War. And across the street from us is Clayborn Temple.\u201d Clayborn Temple is where the sanitation workers produced and handed out the I AM A MAN placards. Wexler, John Pugliese, the team\u2019s vice president of marketing, communications and broadcast, and Director of Creative Services David Thompson worked with Nike over the last year-plus on the uniform design. (Nike, which designed every team\u2019s City Edition uniforms, also has a large presence in Memphis; its $300 million North American Logistics Campus here is the largest single entity for the company outside Nike\u2019s home state of Oregon.) They consulted with the NCRM.  \u201cThis was not a moment where you wanted splashes of color and something that stood out,\u201d Wexler said. \u201cIt had to be dignified and respectful of the moment. These great black and white photos, people marching in their suits \u2026 it just all came together. You\u2019re not going to stick a neon color on something like that. That\u2019s not what this moment is about.\u201d But what is it about? NBA players engage in wonderful acts of philanthropy, service and dialogue with the community in every NBA city. No sentient person doubts LeBron James\u2019 sincerity in pledging college scholarships for every public school kid in his native Akron, Ohio, through a partnership with the University of Akron. No one would argue that DeMarcus Cousins wasn\u2019t genuine when he brought cops and citizens of Sacramento and Birmingham together in separate events over the last year. But do they work in the spirit of what King preached? \u201cOf course, the struggles that the activist athletes of today are waging is in the truest and most profound spirit and vision of Dr. King \u2014 struggle founded upon a concern over injustice perpetrated against the vulnerable and voiceless, a courageous commitment to address and confront that injustice boldly, nonviolently, and uncompromisingly, and a willingness to sacrifice their fortunes, risk their careers and (if the death threats so many of them have received are factored in) their very lives in their pursuit of \u2018that more Perfect Union,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Harry Edwards, the prominent sociologist and civil rights advocate, via e-mail. \u201cWere Dr. M.L. King here in body with us today, it would be my guess that he would be \u2018taking a knee with (Colin) Kaepernick, raising a fist with Malcolm Jenkins, taking a seat with Marshawn Lynch, or simply saying AMEN! to the remarks of LeBron, D-Wade, CP3, and Carmelo at the ESPYs a couple of years back,\u201d Edwards wrote. Yet despite the presence of a mammoth corporation like FedEx, which is headquartered here, and other huge companies like Auto Zone, International Paper and ServiceMaster, Memphis, and especially its black citizens, remain poor \u2014 ear-splittingly poor. The \u201cMemphis Poverty Fact Sheet\u201d for 2017 , published last September by the University of Memphis, ticked off the numbers: the city\u2019s poverty rate is 26.9 percent. Child poverty in the city is \u2026 44.7 percent. The poverty rate for non-Hispanic African-Americans is 32.3 percent. Memphis is the poorest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the nation with more than a million people. So, all the great work that the Grizzlies do in the community \u2026 what does it mean? Does it have impact? Does any of this have any impact? And is that too much to ask of any one NBA player, or team, or league, for that matter? These aren\u2019t mathematicians and social scientists; these are guards and forwards and marketers. (And, lawyers. Lots and lots of lawyers.) Memphis thus strains under the dual one-two punch it gets, for its past and its present. \u201cThere\u2019s always this narrative that Memphis is still, like, staggering, really, under the shame of being the city where King was killed, even 50 years out,\u201d said Wendi Thomas, a journalist and 2016 Neiman Fellow who launched MLK 50: Justice Through Journalism , an ongoing nonprofit online reporting project highlighting the stark economic problems that remain in Memphis, and is supported by the National Civil Rights Museum in conjunction with the museum\u2019s MLK50 commemoration. \u201cWe\u2019re in this constant process of atonement,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think part of the challenge becomes, to you, what part of King\u2019s legacy are you trying to redeem? If it\u2019s just the little black boys and little white boys holding hands part, I think the Grizzlies as an organization do a good job of bringing diverse groups of people together under the same roof. If you understand why King was in Memphis \u2014 which is about jobs and wages, underpaid public employees \u2014 then the question could be, do the Grizzlies even have a place in that, in that discussion? Because they\u2019re a business. But I would argue that, yes they do, and moreover, so does any other business or entity that\u2019s going to trot out a King quote on that day.\u201d Indeed, King\u2019s pivot from demanding civil rights for African-Americans to fighting for economic justice is still, to this day, far less discussed and celebrated by most. In 1966, King went to Chicago to fight against segregated housing, but also to demand an increase in the local minimum wage, to $2 an hour \u2014 in today\u2019s dollars, $15.13 per hour \u2014 just exactly about what the \u201cFight for $15\u201d movement is seeking across the country today. And King did not fare as well and have the universal support for his economic fights than he did for civil rights; he famously said, after being hit in the head by a rock during a march in Marquette Park in August, 1966, \u201cI think the people from Mississippi ought to come to Chicago to learn how to hate.\u201d The city\u2019s notorious Mayor, Richard J. Daley, placated King, but never followed through on the promises he made the minister while King was there. Nonetheless, King came to Memphis after sanitation workers Echol Cole and Robert Walker were killed on Feb. 1, 1968 , when a malfunctioning garbage truck shorted out, starting the truck\u2019s compactor while the men were on the back of the truck. They couldn\u2019t escape in time and were crushed inside. Soon after their deaths, on Feb. 12, 1968, 1,300 of Memphis\u2019s sanitation workers went on strike, demanding not only improved working conditions ( the \u201cwiener barrel\u201d trucks like the one that malfunctioned were horribly outdated and often flipped over as well), but modern-day financial amenities. They had \u201cno benefits, no pension, no overtime, no grievance procedure, no insurance, no uniforms\u201d \u2026 . King had announced in December, 1967, that he was starting a nationwide moment \u2014 a \u201cPoor People\u2019s Campaign\u201d \u2014 to highlight the stark poverty that still roiled large swaths of cities and rural areas around the country. The campaign demanded $30 billion in annual federal money to combat poverty, construction of 500,000 low-cost homes and Congressional backing for a full employment, guaranteed wage bill. Plans were made for a second March on Washington, similar to the seminal one in 1963, the site of King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech , which would feature the construction of a shanty town on the grounds of the National Mall where protestors would remain until the proposed bills were passed into law. At the invitation of his longtime friend, the Rev. James Lawson, who had been helping lead the protests in Memphis, King came to the city in March to offer his public support for the striking workers. Police had shot mace into protesting crowds in late February; more than 100 people were arrested in early March. King arrived on March 18 and spoke to more than 10,000 people at the Mason Temple; he pledged to return later in the month and lead a march himself. He came back on March 28 for the march, but a few rioters who broke windows as the march went down Beale Street made finishing the march peacefully impossible. At the urging of fellow clergy, who feared for his safety, King left the march before police descended on the protestors. One teenager, thought to be looting, was shot and killed by police, and hundreds of people were arrested. It was one of the first times a march led by King had fallen into violence, in part, by his own protestors. He had prior commitments out of town in the next days, but vowed he would again return to Memphis to lead another march. He returned to Memphis on April 3, 1968, and checked into Room 306 of the Lorraine Motel. Speaking again at Mason Temple, King delivered the last speech of his life. He was not feeling well, yet roused himself, as ever, to bring his crowd to its feet. The ending of the speech, of course, is what almost everyone remembers; almost prophetically, King said that while he\u2019d like to live a long life \u2014 \u201clongevity has its place,\u201d he said \u2014 what happened to his physical body no longer mattered to him. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v \u201cI just want to do God\u2019s will,\u201d he said . \u201cAnd he\u2019s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I\u2019ve looked over. And I\u2019ve seen \u2026 the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we as a people will get to the promised land! So I\u2019m happy tonight \u2014 I\u2019m not worried about anything; I\u2019m not fearing any man! Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!\u201d Yet the bulk of King\u2019s speech was not about prophecy, but policy. \u201cThe issue is the refusal of Memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants, who happen to be sanitation workers,\u201d he said earlier in the speech \u2014 which ran more than 40 minutes, not three . \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to keep attention on that \u2026 we just need to go around to these stores, and to these massive industries in our country, and say, \u2018God sent us by here to say to you that you\u2019re not treating His children right. And we\u2019ve come by here to ask you to make the first item on your agenda fair treatment where God\u2019s children are concerned. Now if you are not prepared to do that, we do have an agenda that we must follow. And our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you.\u201d King called for Memphis\u2019 black citizens not to buy Coca-Cola, or Sealtest Milk. He asked they boycott not one, but two bread companies \u2014 Wonder Bread and Hart\u2019s Bread. \u201cWe are choosing these companies because they haven\u2019t been fair in their hiring policies,\u201d King said, \u201cand we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike. And then they can move on downtown and tell Mayor (Henry) Loeb to do what is right.\u201d He told Memphis\u2019 black population to take its money out of white banks and to patronize Tri-State Bank, a black-owned bank founded in 1946; to do business with black insurance companies; to \u201cbegin the process of building a greater economic base, and at the same time, we are putting pressure where it really hurts,\u201d King said. So, where does that leave Memphis, and the people who live and work here now? \u201cI think today, to honor King, you\u2019ve got to look at what you pay your workers,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cDon\u2019t put a King quote up on the screen, on the JumboTron \u2014 that new, beautiful JumboTron \u2014 but your workers are making $9 an hour, talking about, get your beer here. Then, you\u2019re just playing. It feels like you\u2019re mocking what King stood for. And that bothers me, as somebody who started this non-profit journalism project, who raised a lot of money so we can make sure we can pay our workers at least $15 an hour, all our contributors. Is it this team\u2019s job to lead that conversation? I\u2019m not sure. But I know that\u2019s where Coach Fizdale was headed.\u201d Politically, at least, there have been stirrings in the city among the city\u2019s black residents, with the statue removal serving as a catalyst. \u201cThe woman who really led the \u2018Take \u2018Em Down\u2019 movement, Tami Sawyer , she\u2019s also running for office (Shelby County Commission),\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt seems like every other day, I see on Facebook, some announcement, some young black person, who\u2019s announced that they\u2019re running for a local office in Memphis. And what I think it\u2019s doing is, it\u2019s creating this new wave of young black people who think they can change their world, too. And that, to me, is exciting.\u201d It is beyond any one player, no matter how famous or rich; beyond any one league, no matter how popular or viewed. Yet so many come here to Memphis, this year, to vow that they have not forgotten who came before, and to, as John Wesley said, Do all the good you can, By all the means you can, In all the ways you can, In all the places you can, At all the times you can, To all the people you can, As long as ever you can. \u201cWill these activist athletes words and deeds \u2018make a difference?,\u2019 \u201d Edwards asked. \u201cAnytime people stand up based upon a principled commitment to freedom and justice, THAT IS THE IMPACT! When the words and actions of activist athletes precipitate comments from presidents, imitation across the spectrum of the sports hierarchy from Pop Warner football to women\u2019s soccer, when there are entire departments of public defenders (the Alameda Co. Office) go public with a group photo taking a knee, when Congressmen and women are taking a knee on the floor of the US Congress, when 2-year old begs to wear his Kaepernick jersey so that he can take a knee \u2014 has the athlete activist movement had an impact ? Yes \u2014 I\u2019d say so! The question is not IF, but HOW MUCH; and that story is still evolving.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Melvin McCoy : A lot to unpack there, Melvin. To your first point: yes, at present, some \u2014 not all \u2014 of the Cavs\u2019 vets are struggling. J.R. Smith is having a terrible season; not only is his current 7.6 points per game the lowest of his career , but more important, he\u2019s shooting just 37.5 percent \u2014 which is actually a little better than he shot last season. Iman Shumpert has been hurt most of the season, as has Derrick Rose. Jae Crowder, part of the Isaiah Thomas-Kyrie Irving trade, is still looking for his footing offensively; he\u2019s shooting just 30 percent on threes this year after shooting 40 percent for Boston last year. (Dwyane Wade and Kyle Korver have been solid; in fact, they compose some of Cleveland\u2019s better three- and four-man defensive units.) I disagree with you about Love, even if he had one bad defensive sequence in Toronto; he\u2019s been an All-Star this season. The bad defense is team-wide, a function of little in the way of rim protection, bad shooting on offense which leads to transition opportunities for opponents, and almost no on-ball pressure from the Cavs\u2019 guards. They just don\u2019t have anyone who can stop people at the point of attack. That\u2019s why you hear so much about Jordan; if Cleveland\u2019s not going to stop people from getting in the paint, the Cavs need someone who can erase those mistakes at the front of the rim. Tristan Thompson would obviously be in any potential deal for Jordan; the hangup, as everyone knows, is the unprotected 2018 Brooklyn first Cleveland got from Boston. The Cavs want to hold onto it; the Clippers want it. We\u2019ll see who blinks. Drake is all in. How \u2018bout you? From Asif Haque: I get the reluctance to go all-in on Toronto. The Raptors seemed to have plateaued over this three-year stretch \u2014 a 50-win team that had no chance of beating Cleveland. But I think they\u2019re different this year, and I thought that before they pounded the Cavs last week. DeMar DeRozan is a legit MVP candidate and they really have changed the offense to incorporate threes and get more ball movement \u2014 without sacrificing at the defensive end. What I don\u2019t know is what O.G. Anunoby and Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poeltl are going to do in the playoffs. History would lean toward their production tailing off, as happens with most young players when they\u2019re truly counted on in their first postseasons. That would be cause for concern. But they got C.J. Miles for a reason, and I think he\u2019s going to be a bigger piece to the puzzle down the stretch than he\u2019s been so far. Just good, clean fun. From Eddie Diener: Maybe start by not sticking out a forearm to the guy\u2019s chest and neck, for starters. Perhaps try grabbing\/hugging him with two hands. Delly\u2019s not some weekend ham and egger; he\u2019s a professional basketball player. They know how to foul people without hurting them or putting them in physical danger. I\u2019m not buying the excuse that he\u2019s \u201cslow\u201d or \u201cnot athletic;\u201d those are buzzwords. He\u2019s in the NBA. And as part of the fraternity, you don\u2019t do things that could keep another man from taking care of himself and his family. He was thrown out of the game for a reason. The points don\u2019t count the same because \u2026 why, again? From Evan Sponseller: Mike D\u2019Antoni was 253-136 (.650 win percentage) in his four-plus seasons in Phoenix. The Suns are a collective 348-417 (.455) in the nine-plus seasons since he left. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re devaluing D\u2019Antoni\u2019s wins and\/or record because you like Kobe. You can make a case for him in each of those Nash MVP seasons; Bryant led the league in scoring (35.4 ppg) the second season, 2005-06, and the Lakers went 45-37 (it was the first year of Phil Jackson\u2019s second go-round in L.A.) But Nash\u2019s Suns went 54-28 that year \u2014 and beat Bryant and the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs! The Suns changed the way the NBA game was played, and Nash was a great, great point guard. That they didn\u2019t make a Finals doesn\u2019t diminish what they, and he, did in those regular seasons. As for Harden, he\u2019s been pretty good in Houston no matter who\u2019s been coaching, so I\u2019m not going to penalize him for some vague \u201cthese stats aren\u2019t real\u201d reason.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (DNP: strained hamstring) 2) Kevin Durant (30.3 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 5 apg, .643 FG, .667 FT): Became the second-youngest player in league history (LeBron was the youngest) to reach 20,000 career points , during Golden State\u2019s unexpected loss on Wednesday to the Clippers. 3) LeBron James (21 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 5.7 apg, .490 FG, .706 FT): His 10 points in limited (for him) minutes during the blowout loss to Minnesota last week were the fewest he\u2019s scored in a game since scoring 10 on the opening night of the 2007-08 regular season against Dallas \u2014 a span of 710 regular season games. 4) Kyrie Irving (20 ppg, 6 rpg, 7 apg, .350 FG, 1.000 FT): Highest usage rate (31.4) of his career, yet also shooting the highest percentage (.477, though he is down a tick on threes from last season) from the floor. 5) DeMar DeRozan (28.8 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 5.8 apg, .447 FG, .783 FT): Posted third game with 40 or more points (42) in the last three weeks in Saturday\u2019s loss to the Warriors. Dropped out: Giannis Antetokounmpo 344 \u2014 Days since Zach LaVine, then with the Timberwolves, tore his ACL, before returning to action with the Bulls Saturday night. LaVine made 5 of 9 shots and scored 14 points in 19 minutes. 95 \u2014 Consecutive games in which Klay Thompson made at least one 3-pointer, a streak that ended in the Warriors\u2019 game Friday against Milwaukee when he missed his only two attempts. Thompson\u2019s last threeless game came on Dec. 10, 2016, against Memphis. 4 \u2014 Current NBA players \u2014 Dwight Howard (12,592), Dirk Nowitzki (11,137), Pau Gasol (10,892) and Zach Randolph (10,072) \u2014 with more career rebounds than Phoenix\u2019s Tyson Chandler , who became the 40th player in league history to grab more than 10,000 career rebounds in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Pacers. 1) Welcome back, Steve Clifford. Glad you\u2019re taking, and will take, better care of you . The NBA is a better place with you in it. 2 ) Former player and Chicago native Quentin Richardson , with the soul of a poet , in The Players\u2019 Tribune. (Very NSFW, but nonetheless very good, too.) 3) Joe Johnson, now between 71 and 74 years old, may not be a 30-35 minute player anymore, but he can still get buckets. And I\u2019ll be shocked if he\u2019s not in another uniform by March. Now, I\u2019d be surprised if anyone traded for him because of his impending free agent status. But a buyout from Utah, prorated to less than half of his $10.5 million salary this season, would be minimal, allowing him to take IsoJoe ball to a playoff contender near you. 1) It is hard to fathom how much lower the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in my beloved Washington, D.C., can sink. To refer to Haiti and the African nations with the words he used and that I will not use here is to have complete and utter contempt for their people; you have to not only not know any history about the country\/countries, you have to not be interested in learning about those histories. (Author Jonathan Katz, who\u2019s written extensively about Haiti over the years, provides a brief, Twitter-chunk one of Haiti here .) It means having to believe that the people there are too stupid and\/or corrupt to govern themselves, which allows one to feel superior. (Whether that\u2019s intellectually, morally or racially, or some combination, only your heart knows.) It does not matter if others feel that way; lots of people think the moon landing was faked, and that does not make them right. This isn\u2019t political. I don\u2019t support the president politically. This is about decency, and whether the man who occupies the White House is going to appeal to the best of our instincts and beliefs, or the worst. 2) The Orlando Magic isn\u2019t meshing, other than coming together to be a sieve at the defensive end of the floor. I\u2019m keeping Jonathan Simmons, who\u2019s tough and physical. I\u2019m keeping Elfrid Payton, who is continuing to figure it out on offense (career-high shooting across the board, including 50.7 percent overall from the floor, 37.5 percent on 3-pointers, .538 eFG). We can talk about everyone else. You heard me. Everyone else. All that \u201ctalent\u201d is 41-83 the last year and a half. 3) The Heat\u2019s on fire right now, but it\u2019s hard to see Miami being able to sustain this the second half of the season without Dion Waiters. Can definitely see the Heat being aggressive at the trade deadline. 4) RIP, Keith Jackson, a great and consequential broadcaster who, while best known for his mellifluous calls of big college football games the last four decades ( man, this is an incredible open to a Tennessee-Alabama game in 1992 ), was also a) the original play-by-play man for Monday Night Football in 1970 for ABC, and b) the play-by-play man on NBA broadcasts when ABC had the pro basketball package in the late \u201860s and early \u201870s. I never met him in person, but I had a very meaningful phone conversation with him a few years ago that was personal in nature and meant a great deal to me. Blessings to his family. \u2013Veteran NBA guard Anthony Morrow (@MrAnthonyMorrow), Sunday, 4:32 p.m. Yeah, can\u2019t be wearing white and sitting poolside right about now most places. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably never stop. There\u2019s people who think LeBron James sucks \u2026 so if that happens, I\u2019m sure there will always be people who always think I suck.\u201d \u2014 Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles , asked before his team\u2019s playoff game Sunday with the Steelers how he deals with the relentless criticism of his play this season. This was before Bortles led the Jags to the upset win in Pittsburgh, getting them to the AFC championship game next Sunday in New England. \u201cI was very candid with him. I told him I would be happy to trade him. You get me a talent like Kevin Durant and I will drive you to the airport. I will pack your bags and I will drive you there,\u2019 and he laughed. And I said, \u2018Short of that I am your best buddy, and you are here for another year and you ain\u2019t going nowhere because for you talent-wise, we are not going to get what we want, so let\u2019s figure this thing out. And we did.\u201d \u2014 Gregg Popovich , revealing Thursday that LaMarcus Aldridge asked to be traded during the offseason after a poor 2016-17 season. Popovich and the Spurs didn\u2019t trade Aldridge, of course; the coach acknowledged at the start of this season that he used Aldridge poorly last season, and has changed the offense this year to get Aldridge more touches and shots. \u201cI went from the R to the star.\u201d \u2014 Rockets forward Gerald Green , to veteran Houston sports reporter Mark Berman, on his new look featuring the Houston Astros logo braided into his hair. Green had previously had the Rockets logo braided in after he signed with Houston late last month. This is nothing new for Green, who had a shamrock in his hair while with the Celtics last season. Green says he wanted to honor the World Series winning Astros and their role in helping bring happiness to his hometown after Hurricane Harvey\u2019s devastating impact last summer. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

I mean, wholeheartedly, too. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t realize it, probably, until about a week and a half, two weeks before the Draft. Once I got invited to the Green Room, that\u2019s when I was like, okay, I\u2019m first, I\u2019m getting drafted in the first round. Because they try their best not to let guys sit in there forever. \u201cSo I\u2019m like, first round. Now, will I be drafted to the Knicks at eight, or all the way down to, who was it? OKC or Utah. \u2018Cause OKC had 22 and Utah had 24. So now that was a factor. From before then, I didn\u2019t know what to expect, to be honest.\u201d If he was surprised in June, when he was taken 13th overall by the Denver Nuggets \u2014 and then minutes later traded to Utah \u2014 it\u2019s the rest of the league that\u2019s been shocked since. Mitchell had a lot of supporters before the Draft, including Utah, which traded up from 24 to 13 in the first round by sending former first-rounder Trey Lyles and the No. 24 pick in 2017, Tyler Lydon, to Denver . But even after looking like the best player in the Las Vegas Summer League, no one, including Utah, thought Mitchell would streak across the sky this quickly. To date, Mitchell leads all rookies (and the Jazz) in scoring (18.8 per game) , having worked himself into the starting lineup before Thanksgiving. He broke the franchise\u2019s single-game rookie scoring record (41 points) well before Christmas, and helped lead his squad to a win over LeBron James and the Cavs on Dec. 30 , leaving James to compare Mitchell to a young Dwyane Wade. Highlight-reel dunks have been a regular occurrence at Vivint Smart Home Arena. He\u2019s given the Blazers 28 , Minnesota and Milwaukee 24 . Oklahoma City got 31 ; Houston, 26 . After shooting 41.3 percent in November , he shot 50.7 percent in December . \u201cI\u2019ve played with a lot of good rookies, but this kid is special,\u201d guard Ricky Rubio said of Mitchell. \u201cJust because he\u2019s willing to learn. He\u2019s asking a lot of questions. He\u2019s humble. And he keeps improving. He\u2019s improved so fast. He watches film all the time, he asks questions, and he\u2019s willing to learn. Most of them are good questions. But he knows the game and you can tell, because he knows the game very well and he wants to get better.\u201d His arrival, coming just as Gordon Hayward was leaving town to go to Boston via free agency , was a much-needed pick-me-up for a franchise that had been gut punched. You don\u2019t lose your franchise player for nothing without it hurting \u2014 and, make no mistake, it hurt. The Jazz did everything it could to keep Hayward happy, methodically building a strong team around him, making development a priority. Utah beat the LA Clippers in the first round of the 2017 playoffs with Hayward; without him, and with numerous injuries to its core group, including separate, long-term injuries to Utah\u2019s irreplaceable center, Rudy Gobert, the Jazz is stumbling along, off the pace for a playoff spot and in 10th place in the Western Conference. \u201cI think we knew going into the year \u2014 the word we\u2019ve used is \u2018pivot\u2019 \u2014 what that looks like, how that takes place,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of open to, we\u2019re all a little curious about how that would evolve. It hasn\u2019t evolved, in some ways, with Rudy being out. In other ways, it\u2019s evolved, it\u2019s just been different. We\u2019re still kind of gathering information about our team. But I think in Donovan\u2019s case, what he\u2019s been able to do, he\u2019s been a catalyst for a lot of things. He\u2019s been a catalyst for his teammates. We\u2019ve seen certain guys find roles that I think they\u2019re going to be successful in. In some cases, we\u2019re not able to do that, because of Rudy. It\u2019s really kind of two things that are happening at once.\u201d Mitchell was initially projected to go in the late teens or early 20s in the first round, after declaring following his sophomore season at Louisville. His pedigree was at once enticing and troubling \u2014 \u201cRick (Pitino, the former Cardinals\u2019 coach) makes his players better than they are,\u201d one team executive said before the Draft. But Mitchell started rising team boards following a series of excellent pre-Draft workouts. The Jazz believed Mitchell would be a good fit in their system, but also knew it would have to move up to get him, and Utah could only get so high in the first round. But once Mitchell got past Charlotte at 10 (the Hornets took Malik Monk) and Detroit at 11 (the Pistons took Luke Kennard), Jazz General Manager Dennis Lindsey made the move. \u201cWhen we were able to draft him, I know how enthusiastic Dennis was going into that,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a catalyst for a lot of growth, and I think the results speak for themselves. But I think it\u2019s also, the best thing about Donovan is, similar to the rest of our group, there\u2019s a hunger on his part to improve and get better. That enthusiasm and that kind of youthful exuberance is a good thing for our team.\u201d Snyder has been convinced, to the point where he\u2019s now running plays for Mitchell at the ends of games. Sometimes it works, as it did against Cleveland; sometimes it doesn\u2019t, as when Mitchell missed against Miami, and Josh Richardson hit the game-winner for the Heat instead . \u201cThat was part of the moment,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been one to kind of, I\u2019ve always wanted to be the guy. I watched, my favorite player growing up was LeBron. One thing I noticed with him was, it\u2019s always on him at the end of the game. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case now, but I\u2019ve always had that mentality of not being afraid of the moment \u2014 made shot, missed shot. I made one against Cleveland and I missed one in Miami that should have been a pass that I didn\u2019t make. It comes with the territory. You\u2019ve got to keep learning. But that was a pretty cool moment.\u201d But he messed up a few nights later in Miami. \u201cRodney (Hood) had it going in the fourth quarter, and for me to miss him, it\u2019s definitely one thing that I\u2019m still kicking myself for,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAfter the game I went to him and said \u2018look, it\u2019s my fault. You were wide open. That\u2019s on me.\u2019 And that goes back to what I said about having it be on your shoulders, and just having that mentality. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been.\u201d The Jazz acquired Rubio from Minnesota to play the point and to try and convince Hayward to stay. But Mitchell\u2019s versatility has allowed Snyder to put him on the ball for stretches already, making his ultimate NBA position a mystery. Utah has a lot of options in its backcourt, and it hasn\u2019t given up on former Lottery pick Dante Exum, who\u2019s likely to miss the entire season after suffering a shoulder injury in preseason . But Mitchell makes Exum\u2019s absence survivable \u2014 and, maybe, his future in Salt Lake City uncertain. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing it every night, and he wants it more,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe know how tough it is your rookie season; imagine if you\u2019re one of the top guys on the team, and we expect you to bring it every night, because you showed you can do it. The (expectation) level is rising higher and higher every day, just because of the way he does things.\u201d Rubio had immense pressure on him when Minnesota famously took him fifth in the 2009 Draft , a teenager from Spain who\u2019d already had all the world\u2019s attention on him for years. He knows what it\u2019s like to be a guard expected to raise a team to the next level. \u201cThere are a lot of rookies that are still young, but they\u2019re young off the court,\u201d Rubio said of Mitchell. \u201cHe\u2019s really, he\u2019s a kid, but he knows what is going on.\u201d The Jazz could ultimately run some two-guard fronts with Mitchell and Rubio, maybe Mitchell and Exum, though one of those two would have to become a bigger perimeter threat. Mitchell, a former star high school baseball player \u2014 his father, Donovan, Sr., was a former minor leaguer who\u2019s now an executive with the New York Mets \u2014 has taken to Snyder as quickly as he bonded with Pitino, with whom he stays in touch despite Pitino\u2019s ouster from Louisville in November. \u201cCoach (Snyder) and I, the good thing is, we have a relationship where, he\u2019ll call a play, call a play for me, and I\u2019m like \u2018no, coach, Joe (Johnson) just hit two. Let\u2019s get Joe a third one,\u2019 \u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, he\u2019s not offended when I speak up. We have a relationship where we can talk back and forth. There\u2019s no disrespect. It\u2019s just, I give my opinion, and he listens. Sometimes, he says no. It\u2019s because he\u2019s been in the game a lot longer than I have, obviously. But it\u2019s just the fact that he allows me to give my input in, and allows me to learn that way, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d The injuries \u2014 Hood and Derrick Favors and Johnson have all missed time this season, along with Gobert, who\u2019s only played 18 games \u2014 have made continuity impossible. (It\u2019s only getting worse; guard Thabo Sefolosha is likely out for the season with a knee injury suffered Friday against Charlotte.) That Utah had to not only replace Hayward, but opted not to bring back Boris Diaw and George Hill, bringing in veteran free agents Jonas Jerebko, Sefolosha and Ekpe Udoh \u2014 who came from Europe, where he was MVP of EuroLeague last spring \u2014 has made everyone\u2019s adjustments harder. Jerebko has had to play center of late. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of new players,\u201d Jerebko said. \u201cRicky, obviously, the leader of the team is new, too. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to, right away, start clicking. Obviously, it\u2019s going to take some time. But we\u2019ve got some great guys on this team who are willing to learn, share the ball, unselfish players. We\u2019re going to figure it out. \u201c Mitchell has played with Rubio, Hood and Joe Ingles on the ball at times, depending on lineups and situations. Like all rookies, he\u2019s learning what the right reads and cuts are, making sure the right guy gets the right shot at the right time. Sometimes, that guy is him. Defense, and getting through screens, provide a nightly challenge. \u201cIt was pretty easy in college, because you always either run through a guy or you find a way to get around him,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no running through DeMarcus Cousins. There\u2019s no running through those guys. So you\u2019ve just got to be able to find a way, and understand you\u2019re going to get hit. You\u2019ve got to be able to pursue and follow. Playing for Coach Pitino, Coach Pitino said you should never be hit by any screen. So that\u2019s my mentality, and I get pretty down on myself when I get hit by screens. But I\u2019m starting to undersand that that\u2019s inevitable; it\u2019s going to happen. Making guys work for their shots. If a guy has 40, make him work for the 40. \u2018Cause guys are good enough to have 40, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. But make sure they work their hardest to get to it.\u201d Keeping a similar routine is important for Mitchell. At Louisville, he took the same number of shots before a game, sang the same song as he walked into every arena. (\u201cThat\u2019s just how superstitious I am. I can\u2019t say [what the song is]; that would mess everything up,\u201d he says.) In Utah, he has Caesar salad from Cheesecake Factory for lunch and dinner. Mitchell and Utah\u2019s other young players were in Vegas when Hayward announced he was leaving. The next few weeks were tough ones for one of the NBA\u2019s proudest franchises. But Mitchell gives Utah hope. Every team needs hope, but a small market franchise is especially needy. And if Mitchell becomes a flashy, exciting star guard, Utah\u2019s ability to get and retain other talented players in the future to play with him and Gobert increases dramatically. But Mitchell says he\u2019s just doing what needs to be done. The talk of him becoming Utah\u2019s next superstar player is not on his radar. \u201cWhen Dante got hurt, I had to play more minutes at point guard,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThen Rodney got hurt, so I\u2019m playing all these minutes. I\u2019ve got to learn these players, from one, two and three, and as the point guard you\u2019ve got to know all five spots. So I\u2019m in there watching film tremendously. But it never crossed my mind to replace (Hayward). That\u2019s not who I am. That\u2019s not where I came from. I want to be the best teammate I can be, the fastest learner, the hardest worker, and just go out there in any way that I can help in each game. If I\u2019m having an off night, make sure the guys who are having an on night get the ball. Rebounding, playing defense. If I\u2019m having an on night, continue to score and making the right plays, whatever it may be.\u201d Utah has a lot of decisions to make in the coming months about the direction of the franchise. Favors will be an unrestricted free agent at season\u2019s end; Exum and Hood will be restricted. Sefolosha, Udoh and Jerebko are all on non-guaranteed deals for 2018-19. But one piece is solidly in place for a long, long time \u2014 one who looks like he\u2019ll be must-see TV most every night, and a threat to make the highlights every game. \u201cI think the craziest thing is not so much watching myself, it\u2019s watching who\u2019s guarding me, or who I\u2019m guarding,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing. I watch film religiously, on the flight or wherever it may be. I\u2019m watching, and I\u2019m like, wow, I got a stop \u2014 in the game, I won\u2019t think it \u2014 but I\u2019m like, \u2018wow, I just got a stop on \u2018Bron. I got a stop on Westbrook.\u2019 Those are the things that kind of take me back for a second. Not so much that I\u2019m making those plays, but it\u2019s like, last year, I was watching this guy against the Warriors in the Finals, and screaming and yelling at the TV. Now it\u2019s like in the late moments, making a layup like that (against James\u2019 Cavaliers), it\u2019s like, it\u2019s crazy how it all happened.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

They both covet what the other wants \u2014 in fact, the Warriors or the Cavs could make a persuasive case that, if not for the other guys, one already would have notched a three-peat and be chasing Bill Russell\u2019s Celtics in pursuit of a fourth consecutive championship. They both have poured buckets of blood, sweat, tears, money, Gatorade and offseason counter moves into their nouveau NBA rivalry. And they both, well, as Golden State coach Steve Kerr phrased it to the San Jose Mercury News Sunday, \u201cWe just want to kick each other\u2019s ass.\u201d And yet the Warriors and the Cavaliers \u2014 who play again Monday at Quicken Loans Arena in the NBA\u2019s prime-time MLK showdown \u2014 have more in common with each other than they do with any of the league\u2019s other 28 teams. Playing 100 games or so every year. Locking in mentally and surviving physically longer than anyone else. Showing up each night targeted as a measuring stick, even a season maker, by the opponents. While trying like heck to keep things fresh. Renew. Find and tap into a new source of energy, because old ones wane over time. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest challenge of this whole season,\u201d Kerr told NBA.com late last week, with the Warriors starting a back-to-back in Milwaukee and Toronto on their way back to The Land. Even if it were possible \u2014 and it realistically is not, given free agency, injuries, trades, the salary cap, luxury taxes, hirings and firings each NBA offseason \u2014 playing a pat hand from one championship-level season to the next isn\u2019t desirable. Voices, locker rooms, relationships get stale. Rivals adjust and escalate in the arms race. Some players ebb in the pecking order, others flow. It\u2019s important to inject new faces, add skills and even find fresh themes to fend off monotony, even boredom, through the 82-game slogs. The Warriors, in winning 20 of 23 games over the past seven weeks, largely have managed to do that. The Cavaliers, at 26-15 after 2-7 stretch that started at Golden State on Christmas? Not so much. It\u2019s easy to think of Golden State\u2019s success since Kerr\u2019s hiring before the 2014-15 season as one uninterrupted run of excellence. Three-pointers, \u201cdeath lineups,\u201d and the rest. But the differences from one year to the next have been fairly pronounced. \u201cIn Year 1, we were trying to prove ourselves to the world,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThen we win the championship \u2014 it was all so fresh. There were no letdowns at all that year. It was the most exciting, it was the most energized, it was the most refreshing. It was brand new to all of us. It felt like we were riding this wave all year \u2014 we were all giddy, like, \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re really good!\u2019 We didn\u2019t know we could be like that. And for me, it was my first year coaching.\u201d Stephen Curry won his first MVP award . He and Klay Thompson generated considerable conversation about the best shooting backcourts in league history. Draymond Green forever changed the old NBA notion of \u201c\u2019tweeners.\u201d The Warriors finished 67-15, ranked second in the league in offense (111.6) and first in defense (101.4) and beat Cleveland in the Finals in six games. \u201cIt was maybe like the first stages when you fall in love,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYou\u2019re just on Cloud 9 and she can\u2019t do anything wrong. There\u2019s infatuation and then you truly fall in love, and it\u2019s amazing. \u201cThe second year, we sort of rode that wave of euphoria of being the best team in the league and having won the title. The next thing you know, we\u2019re 24-0 and we\u2019ve got a chance to set an all-time record. That 73-win mark carried us all year. We were going to prove that, not only were we the champs but we were one of the best teams ever.\u201d The Warriors were \u2014 by regular season standards. Curry won his second MVP award. Kerr missed the first 43 games due to health issues but assistant coach Luke Walton steered them to a 39-4 mark. They bought into the chase for 73 victories fairly late, but instead of a 16-5 playoff run like the previous spring\u2019s, the Warriors went 15-9 \u2014 coming up one victory short when the Cavaliers became the first team to claw back from a 3-1 deficit . That led directly to Golden State\u2019s next new wrinkle, a reconfiguration that came close to buckling the league\u2019s knees. \u201cWe got KD,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cNow we\u2019re changing our team, right? Last year was about incorporating KD, welcoming this incredible player into our organization and our roster. Figuring how to do it, how we were going to adjust. I felt like there were times last year that were tiring, where our guys were done a little bit. But it was \u2018new\u2019 again.\u201d Even the challenges were fresh, like counting Curry\u2019s or Klay Thompson\u2019s touches relative to Durant\u2019s or closing ranks around Golden State\u2019s thin man as his reputation took blows for the first time in his NBA career. Not interested in shooting for 74 victories, the Warriors simply took care of business and stayed coiled for the postseason. Then it was a 16-1 dash to title No. 2, Durant snagging the Finals MVP trophy after the five-game dispatching of the Cavs . All of which just set the Warriors\u2019 bar higher, requiring them to search for something new, somebody borrowed, presumably nothing blue. \u201cThis year it\u2019s just survive and advance,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018let\u2019s get to April, May, June in one piece.\u2019 There\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve lost six home games already. We don\u2019t have the driving force that we had the last few years. We\u2019re dealing with what any team in NBA history that\u2019s tried to do this has dealt with. The Lakers (1982-85), the Celtics (1984-87, 1957-66)\u2026 It\u2019s just really hard and you need that driving force.\u201d Said Warriors vet Andre Iguodala: \u201cYour body is mindful of it, because it hurts.\u201d A couple of young guys \u2014 Patrick McCaw, Kevon Looney \u2014 have taken on bigger roles. Nick Young brings some sort of buzz into any locker room that will have him. Still, as veteran guard Shaun Livingston said: \u201cWe\u2019re not chasing any records. We\u2019re not adding another All Star. We\u2019re just trying to make it through the marathon.\u201d The Cavaliers are just trying to make it through the marathon, too. But if they could, they might do it like Rosie Ruiz, the 1980 women\u2019s \u201cwinner\u201d of the Boston Marathon who perpetrated a hoax by hopping the subway and running only the final mile of Beantown\u2019s famous race. The 2017-18 has been anything but fun for Cleveland so far. It began with the departure of All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, a not-so-funhouse mirror image of Durant\u2019s arrival a year earlier in the Bay Area. Irving, for reasons still not quite explained, made it known in the offseason that he wanted out. He wanted to be the man on his own team. Or he didn\u2019t want to be left in the lurch if (when?) LeBron James took his talents elsewhere again. Or both. Or neither. Regardless, once the Cavaliers made his request come true by dealing him to Boston for All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas and Brooklyn\u2019s coveted first-round pick this June, their task got tougher and their season longer. Losing one of the league\u2019s best ball handlers and shot makers doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201crenewal\u201d any more than what went on in Oklahoma City when Durant packed up. There\u2019s been more. Shooting guard J.R. Smith seemingly got old overnight. Jae Crowder, who came from the Celtics in the Irving deal, hasn\u2019t meshed with the Cavs\u2019 style. Kevin Love has been moved to center but hasn\u2019t done anything to satisfy the Cavs\u2019 need for rim protection. Thomas only returned to action from a hip injury as the calendar turned to 2018 and has played only four games in these two weeks. Even with so many new faces \u2014 seven of the top 12 in coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s rotation weren\u2019t here 12 months ago \u2014 it\u2019s a group heavy on veterans, players a little too established or mature to naturally instill raw energy. James said recently that none of this is new, it\u2019s another case of the Cavs biding their time for the \u201csecond\u201d season that means everything. But Lue also introduced the topic of \u201cagendas,\u201d suggesting that some of his guys were looking out for their own responsibilities and performances \u2014 particularly on defense \u2014 rather than the group\u2019s. At best, this is another dose of the midseason blahs, the Cavs in their doldrums in need of an All-Star break. At worst, though, they might be honing some bad habits that won\u2019t be so easy to break in May or June. Especially if East rivals such as Toronto, Boston or Washington are emboldened after witnessing or administering some of the Cavs\u2019 more embarrassing beat downs this season. Will any of this matter come spring? It will if the switch each team is minding stubbornly decides not to flip. \u201cThat\u2019s the key. You\u2019ve got to find that balance,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAre you flipping the switch or are you navigating? The idea is, don\u2019t let bad habits slip in. Right now, this moment, we\u2019re into some bad habits. Our defensive efforts the last five, six games [before the weekend] were awful. We got away with it because Steph was going nuts.\u201d The Cavaliers repeatedly have not gotten away with bad defensive habits, even on nights when James has been dominant. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cThey\u2019re a team that\u2019s built for the playoffs. But our core guys still are in there prime. Their core guys are still good. But we\u2019re talking about \u2018prime.\u2019\u201d Most still would pick both Golden State and Cleveland to advance all the way to a \u201cFinals Four\u201d (after last year\u2019s \u201cRubber Match\u201d series). But one of these years, most will be wrong \u2014 about one or both. That alone might be motivation enough. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That would be Spencer Dinwiddie. He came a rebound away form a triple double Friday in Atlanta and also rallied the Nets late by making the eventual game-winning basket. Dinwiddie is clearly one of the league\u2019s biggest surprises this season and for a developing team like the Nets, he\u2019s a big catch. He\u2019s having breakout here at age 24, when he was pressed into action with injuries suffered by Jeremy Lin and D\u2019Angelo Russell. The rewards have come right on time for Dinwiddie, who was the third-string guard in Detroit and then couldn\u2019t stick with a Bulls\u2019 team that starved for point guard help. But timing is everything in the NBA and Dinwiddie is proof of that. He wound up in Brooklyn, where the Nets needed to look far and wide for talent. And even then, Dinwiddie was hardly projected for major playing time when he arrived. But the injuries pushed him up the rotation and now he\u2019s a primary option for Brooklyn. Here\u2019s Ben Detrick of The Ringer on the fourth-year guard : He is further proof that the Nets know what they\u2019re doing \u2014 finally. Consider that they\u2019ve created ways to get Russell, Jahlil Okafor, DeMarre Carroll and Nik Stauskas while giving up very little, mainly because they didn\u2019t have much to give up. The only downside in these deals is they threw in their first-rounder last year in the Russell trade, and the Lakers used that pick to select Kyle Kuzma. Oh well, no plan is perfect. But Sean Marks might be the hardest-working GM in the game (because he has no choice) and Brooklyn, very slowly, is delivering on the rebuilding plan. Brooklyn is still near the bottom in the East and doesn\u2019t own its No. 1 pick this coming summer, but they control their picks starting next year. By then, with a favorable salary cap and some decent talent on hand, the Nets could be ready to make a move. * * *"},{"id":169261,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zach-lavine-chicago-bulls-season-debut-acl-injury","date":"2018-01-13","title":"Zach LaVine eager to embrace excitement of long-awaited Bulls debut","content":" * Tonight on NBA League Pass: Pistons vs. Bulls (8 ET) We can officially start the clock on last summer\u2019s big trade between the Bulls and the Wolves because one of the main pieces in that deal is now active. Zach LaVine suits up Saturday for the Bulls , almost a year after knee surgery to repair a torn ACL suffered while still a member of the Wolves. The Bulls have high hopes for the springy guard, who will be on a minutes restriction for the near future; perhaps until sometime after the All-Star break the Bulls could feel comfortable enough to remove the leash. That\u2019s a moment that LaVine, as quoted by NBC Sports Chicago , says can\u2019t wait to see: Look, Jimmy Butler was a good get for the Wolves, who needed a veteran presence and someone who was more than a locker room leader. Butler is likely to be an All-Star again and among other things is serving as an example of how to play defense, something the Wolves have lacked, even in Tom Thibodeau\u2019s first season. But right now, the Bulls are walking around with their chin up, too. Markkanen is a strong contender for the All-Rookie team and Dunn is feeling more comfortable as a starting point guard while working through his flaws (mainly shooting). The Bulls needed to make good on the Butler deal if only because he was, by far, their most valuable commodity. There\u2019s a general feeling in the NBA that teams don\u2019t get fair value for their stars, but if LaVine recovers well, the haul the Bulls got for Butler will go against that theory."},{"id":48017,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lance-stephenson-indiana-pacers-lebon-james-cavaliers","date":"2018-01-13","title":"Lance Stephenson continues to find ways to bother LeBron James","content":" * Recap: Pacers 97, Cavaliers 95 The Cleveland Cavaliers went into Indiana on Saturday looking to find a cure for their ailing defense amid a losing streak and what they found instead was Lance Stephenson. Yes, LeBron James\u2019 personal gnat was at it again, prodding, teasing and playing his air guitar after a few baskets. It\u2019s not that Stephenson was the clear catalyst in the Pacers\u2019 victory, which was a team effort, but Lance being Lance, he had his moments. He guarded LeBron most of the night and prevented LeBron from going nuts, which is what many expected when the Cavs limped into town after getting blasted by the Raptors (without Kyle Lowry). Not only did LeBron fail to have a massive night, but Stephenson scored 16 points with 11 rebounds and took (earned?) a few shoves from LeBron . Gregg Doyel of the Indianapolis News was there to observe : LeBron needed 25 shots to score 27 points and the reeling Cavs have lost eight of nine on the road. But back to Lance \u2014 he has been a plus here in his second stint with the Pacers. Former president Larry Bird was big on Stephenson; Bird thought Stephenson had more fire than his teammates and was surprised when Stephenson rejected Indiana\u2019s contract extension offer three years ago to sign with the Hornets (big mistake). After that experiment died, and a subsequent one with the Clippers, Stephenson came back to Indiana because he had few other options. He was overweight and coming off a few poor seasons. But he\u2019s averaging nine points and six rebounds in a bench role, and even more important, isn\u2019t being a distraction as he often was during his first go-round. At least not to his teammates.

The two jostled with 7:53 remaining in the fourth quarter after Stephenson deflected James\u2019 dribble out of bounds. James then drew a technical foul for shoving Stephenson as he bodied up the 13-time All-Star on the ensuing inbound pass. James dominated with 27 points, eight rebounds and 11 assists but was unable to prevent the Cavaliers from blowing a 22-point deficit. Stephenson finished with 16 points, 11 rebounds and four assists. James blamed himself after the game for \u201cretaliating\u201d against Stephenson\u2019s physical play, but couldn\u2019t resist insulting his long-time foil in the process.  \u201cLance just a little dirty, that\u2019s all,\u201d James said. \u201cHe a little dirty.

They caught me on a retaliation. But he played well tonight.\u201d That history dates back to at least 2012, when Stephenson made the choke sign after James missed a free throw for the Heat in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Stephenson apologized, but former Pacers star Danny Granger later alleged that the stunt aggravated the Heat so much that Udonis Haslem, Juwan Howard and Chris Anderson tried to confront Stephenson in the Pacers locker room during an off day. It was the first of three straight postseason meetings between the two teams, all won by James\u2019 Heat. Stephenson sought to irritate James at seemingly every opportunity, including an incident that launched a thousand memes: Stephenson\u2019s infamous ear-blowing stunt in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals. Stephenson\u2019s career bottomed after those matchups as he bounced between five different teams before rediscovering his game with the Pacers. The one thing, however, he seems to never have lost: The ability to aggravate LeBron James. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the other team\u2019s friend,\u201d Stephenson said . \u201cI\u2019m trying to be my teammates\u2019 friend and when I\u2019m playing against guys \u2026 I want to kick your butt.\u201d"},{"id":169260,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tim-hardaway-jr-returns-new-york-knicks-minutes-restriction","date":"2018-01-13","title":"Tim Hardaway Jr. returns to New York Knicks on minutes restriction","content":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Tim Hardaway Jr. returned to the New York Knicks on Friday night at Minnesota after missing 20 games with a stress injury in his lower left leg.

But you can certainly lose one by then, or lose enough ground in a tight race that you\u2019ll play catch up the rest of the way. The first few weeks of this new calendar year has given rise to certain campaigns (Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry), stalled others (James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Russell Westbrook) and fueled a couple of upstarts (DeMar DeRozan and Jimmy Butler) who are making moves at just the right time. And then there\u2019s LeBron James, who tumbles out of the top five of this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder as his Cleveland Cavaliers, struggling to adjust as they transition Isaiah Thomas into the starting lineup, stumble. LeBron, of course, will be in the conversation until the very end. But in a crowded field where momentum means everything, the four-time winner of the league\u2019s most prestigious regular-season award isn\u2019t riding the wave right now. In fact, the halfway point of this season finds LeBron and his Cavaliers in much the same place they were after that rough 5-7 start to this season. The Cavaliers have lost six of their eight games since their Christmas Day loss to the Golden State Warriors. They\u2019ve lost by 28 points in Minnesota earlier this week and by 34 Thursday night in Toronto . They are in a tailspin right now that no one saw coming when they were winning 19 of the 21 games between these rough patches and LeBron was uppercutting Father Time with his 33rd birthday approaching. \u201cWe\u2019re in a funk, we\u2019re just in a funk. And once again we\u2019re back to the beginning of the season,\u201d LeBron told reporters after the Toronto loss. \u201cWe\u2019re so fragile, and I don\u2019t know where it kind of went wrong or what happened to switch back, but we\u2019ve got try to pick it back up and find it.\u201d The same can be said for his momentum in the MVP chase. * * * The top five in the Week 13 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  26.3 points, 7.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists LA Clippers guard Lou Williams stole the spotlight from Durant on his milestone night , scoring 50 points in a road win Wednesday on the same night Durant dropped 40 and joined the 20,000 point club . That doesn\u2019t diminish Durant\u2019s accomplishment, though. He\u2019s the 44th player in NBA history to cross the 20,000-career points mark and the second youngest to do it (after LeBron James). Durant\u2019s status as one of the league\u2019s all-time great scorers is already set. It\u2019s how rest of his game has evolved that has legitimized any conversation about him being the top player in the league (based on his current shine and not just history or reputation). Durant\u2019s shot blocking prowess \u2014 he ranks second in the league in total blocks (76) \u2014 has turned him into a surprising rim protector and a situational defensive stopper whenever coach Steve Kerr needs him to fill that role. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  24.1 points, 5.0 assists, 3.5 rebounds While his individual scoring (19.2 points in his last five games) and shooting (.387 from the floor, .287 from deep) numbers haven\u2019t been through the roof recently, Irving has remains the catalyst for a Boston team that continues to win games wherever they are. Thursday\u2019s comeback win over Philadelphia in London was the Celtics\u2019 seventh straight victory. And Irving\u2019s all-around work throughout this stretch \u2014 7.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists \u2014 hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. The fact is, his presence has helped elevate the game of youngsters Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier. He\u2019s also done a nice job finding his own niche in the Celtics\u2019 defensive fabric. The Celtics simply would not be the team they are without Irving\u2019s imprint on what they do, which is exactly what he was looking for when he requested that trade from Cleveland over the summer. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  32.3 points, 9.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds Thank goodness for Chris Paul. Harden\u2019s superstar backcourt mate is keeping the Rockets alive while Harden continues to nurse that sore hamstring. To date, Houston is 3-2 since Harden went down. If Harden comes back as early as next week, a possibility according to ESPN Houston , Monday\u2019s game against the LA Clippers would be ideal. The Rockets have to hold the line with San Antonio and Minnesota chasing them in the standings for that No. 2 spot behind the Golden State Warriors. Harden being out into February was a predicament that would be unacceptable for a Rockets team trying to create some separation from the pack in the tight Western Conference playoff chase. This break, if Harden does return in time for the MLK Jr. Day game, could turn out to be an unintended break for a player who would not have eased up otherwise. And we all remember how spent Harden looked at the end of the 2017 playoffs. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  27.9 points, 6.4 assists, 5.2 rebounds A wet spot at shootaround \u2014 and the sprained ankle that followed \u2014 was it took to interrupt a nuclear run by Curry has been on of late. Curry was destroying the competition in the five games before his latest ankle mishap, averaging 35.2 points on 57.4 percent shooting, 53.2 percent from 3-point range and 89.7 percent at the line. Toss in his 5.6 assists and 5.6 rebounds per game and it\u2019s no wonder Curry\u2019s MVP stock is on the rise. He could be back as soon as tonight, when the Warriors visit Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks ( 8 ET, ESPN ). But an even more intriguing game is looming on this road trip. Monday\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day showdown against the Cavaliers in Cleveland ( 8 ET, TNT ) is the matchup everyone is looking forward to, since Curry missed the Christmas Day tilt recovering from an ankle sprained last month. Whenever he comes back, Saturday in Toronto (?), the fireworks will continue. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 8 Season stats:  25.3 points, 5.0 assists, 4.3 rebounds The Raptors played without two starters (Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka), DeRozan didn\u2019t come close to his season scoring average and yet they still walked out of the Air Canada Centre Thursday night having rocked Cleveland by 34 points . Ignore DeRozan\u2019s pedestrian scoring output (13 points on 5-for-13 shooting) and instead focus on the masterful floor game he played (eight assists, three rebounds and no turnovers) in managing coach Dwane Casey\u2019s new, free-flowing offense. The Raptors shared the ball against the Cavaliers and used their young legs to run LeBron James and his struggling crew out of the building. Nights like that aren\u2019t possible without DeRozan making the necessary adjustments to his game. Don\u2019t get it twisted, he\u2019s still as dangerous as ever (25.6 points and six assists in his past five games while shooting 47.8 percent from 3-point range). He\u2019s just doing it in a variety of ways. The next five: 6. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 8. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 9. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves 10. Chris Paul, Houston Rockets And five more \u2026: Lamarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs; Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets An inside look at Terry Rozier from an Eastern Conference scout: \u201cIt was difficult to get a good handle on his game in his first season because Boston had a glut of guards and he wasn\u2019t really a point guard, but at his size you just couldn\u2019t project him as a legitimate shooting guard in our league. He wasn\u2019t ready that rookie season, he just didn\u2019t play enough to get a good evaluation on him. But credit to him and to Danny [Ainge] and the work their staff has done developing him. He\u2019s quickly becoming one of my bench guys to watch because of how hard he plays and just the sheer energy he brings when he\u2019s out there. There\u2019s no doubt the opportunity has increased with Avery Bradley gone and everybody\u2019s role being elevated a bit due to Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury situation. Rozier\u2019s put in the work, though. It shows in his game. \u201cHe\u2019s so much more confident in that stroke (37.2 percent on 3-pointers) and he\u2019s so quick, he can make up for his lack of size sometimes by just being able to get to spots quicker than the next guy. I know he\u2019s got tweener size, but he rebounds (4.4) as well or better than guys four and five inches taller than he is and he does it in fewer minutes. The thing really I love about him and all of their guards is that they are quick enough and athletic enough to run you off of the 3-point line. They do that as well as just about any team in the league and he and Marcus Smart out there together cause all sort of problems. Championship caliber teams have always needed guys like this, role players who can be a factor in whatever amount of times they are on the floor. In recent years, I think about guys like Ian Clark when he was with the Warriors. I thought he played a really crucial role on that team, in terms of always being ready when his number was called and then doing exactly what was needed in a given situation. The role Rozier is being asked to play in Boston right now is similar. You\u2019ve got to have nuts and bolts guys like that in your rotation, guys who are playmakers who maybe don\u2019t fit a certain profile but just get the job done.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Back then, the Lakers were fresh off a Game 7 win in the 2010 Finals as they won back-to-back NBA titles. With Kobe Bryant leading the way, the Lakers had a mini-dynasty of sorts, making three straight NBA Finals from 2008-10. The Lakers retired Bryant\u2019s No. 8 and No. 24 (which he wore during those title seasons of \u201909 and \u201910) in a ceremony last month . Could the other household name and star of those teams, Pau Gasol, find his No. 16 hanging in the rafters at Staples Center soon?

That reputation now goes up another notch with a significant milestone. The 11th-year forward scored his 20,000th career point on Wednesday night , an accomplishment only nine players in NBA history did in fewer games. Durant accomplished the feat in 737 games thanks to the 27.1 points per contest he has averaged over that span. When it comes to age, only LeBron James reached the 20,000-point mark sooner. The achievement is significant. Durant is only the 44th player in NBA history to score more than 20,000 points. Only seven retired players who have done so are not yet in the Hall of Fame: Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Tom Chambers, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Antawn Jamison and Paul Pierce. Allen is a nominee for enshrinement this year, while Bryant, Garnett, Duncan and Pierce are considered locks for the honor when they become eligible. Durant\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is similarly impressive. In addition to surpassing 20,000 career points, he has also earned the Kia Rookie of the Year Award (2008), All-Star Game MVP (2012), Kia Most Valuable Player Award (2014), The Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award (2017), an NBA championship (2017), eight All-Star appearances and seven All-NBA honors.

For the teams, that\u2019s the obvious payoff. It\u2019ll also provide a reminder of the league\u2019s future. A number of the players \u2013 including Kyrie Irving and Joel Embiid \u2013 set to take the court at the O2 Arena are also likely to appear in February\u2019s All-Star Game, some surely going to be bolstered by votes they get from those fans in London and watching worldwide. And the amount of young talent that will be on display makes this the most hotly anticipated matchup of the eight regular-season games that have taken place in England. \u201cI\u2019m appreciative of all fan votes. I\u2019m just a fan of basketball, a fan of sport and now I get to mark off my bucket of playing at the O2 Arena,\u201d said Irving, who is averaging 24.1 points per game to lead the Celtics to a 33-10 start and the top spot in the Eastern Conference standings. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for that experience and to have the opportunity to come here to Europe and especially London and to grow the game of basketball for the NBA.\u201d After the first round of fan voting for this season\u2019s All-Star starters, which NBA followers from all over the world can participate in online, Irving led his nearest challenger among Eastern Conference guards by more than 500,000 votes, leaving him all but assured of a starting spot in Los Angeles on Feb. 18. While the Celtics have exceeded expectations after losing free-agency acquisition Gordon Hayward to a horrific ankle injury on the opening night of the season, the 76ers have struggled to maintain consistency. Still, Philadelphia (19-19) is very much in contention for a playoff berth, a marked improvement on recent years. The team\u2019s development plan, or \u201cThe Process\u201d as it was known, is finally bearing fruit. A healthy Embiid is the main reason why. Drafted in 2014, Embiid missed his first two NBA seasons with foot injuries and managed just 31 games last season. Thursday will be his 30th appearance this season and he is averaging 23.8 points per game. The gregarious 23-year-old is third among Eastern Conference forwards in fan voting, but he is aware a big performance in London could elevate his chances of holding onto his spot. \u201cI\u2019m a winner, I\u2019m competitive but at the same time it\u2019s also for the fans,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI want to have fun, I always do have fun on the court and then I play better when I have fun. I\u2019m going to play team basketball and try to put on a show too.\u201d Another factor in the 76ers\u2019 improvement has been the play of Ben Simmons. The 21-year-old Australian point-forward, a leading rookie of the year candidate, could also become an All-Star. \u201cThat would be amazing,\u201d said Simmons, who\u2019s currently just under 50,000 votes off a starting place. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what I would say about that but it would just be amazing. I\u2019d be blessed.\u201d The next voting update comes out following Thursday\u2019s game, with polls closing Monday. However, 76ers coach Brett Brown said whether Simmons or Embiid is voted into the All-Star game really won\u2019t prove anything. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between popular and championships and that\u2019s my version of a star,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAre you able to get your teams to win and win championships? This is the challenge, for Ben and Joel, that\u2019s my mission for them.\u201d The good thing for Embiid and Simmons, they could do both."},{"id":42398,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/stephen-curry-klay-thompson-out-golden-state-warriors","date":"2018-01-10","title":"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson out for Golden State Warriors vs. LA Clippers","content":" * Tonight on ESPN: Clippers vs. Warriors (10:30 ET) Golden State Warriors guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson will miss tonight\u2019s game against the LA Clippers, the team announced on Wednesday afternoon.

Saw those two dunks in L.A. against the Lakers personally \u2026 my goodness. And I think O.G. Anunoby in Toronto has some serious ups as well. Steve Aschburner : I remember the days when the NBA\u2019s best veterans were willing to compete in the Dunk Contest, but fine: Phoenix\u2019s Josh Jackson could use the kick-start and restart of a nice showcase in L.A., in the event his confidence is waning from an underwhelming first half of the season. And Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell would be as driven to win this thing, I think, as he is about the rest of his game. Besides, he plays in Salt Lake City, so he could use a few more eyeballs on him as he make his Kia Rookie of the Year case. Shaun Powell :  Dennis Smith and Donovan Mitchell. Both are explosive and creative and willing and able to put on a show. Smith in particular would be a delight, because he\u2019s shorter and therefore would be a sentimental candidate. Overall, though, with all due respects to those two and Jayson Tatum, the rookie field lacks the wow-player who\u2019d bring the skills to steal the show. John Schuhmann : Donovan Mitchell, for sure. His combination of raw athleticism and body control should make for some fantastic dunks (and replays). This alley-oop from Sunday was pretty incredible considering how fast he was running the floor and how hard it is (so they tell me) to catch a 35-foot lob pass with one hand. John Collins would be an interesting candidate, too , because that guy is really bouncy.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019ll take Donovan Mitchell in any slam dunk competition. And Dennis Smith and Josh Jackson should have automatic invites. And Smith would go into the competition as the favorite, based on what I\u2019ve seen from him in the past and certainly this season. Someone his size doing the things he can do is perfectly suited for a All-Star Saturday night. But my rookie wild card is Oklahoma City\u2019s Terrence Ferguson . If what I\u2019ve seen from him in recent weeks is any indication, Ferguson has the sort of bounce that could shake up the competition."},{"id":42411,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-players-who-deserve-nba-all-star-2018-voting-surge","date":"2018-01-10","title":"Blogtable: Which East, West player deserves an NBA All-Star 2018 voting surge?","content":" * * * Less than one week left to vote for All-Star starters . Give me one player in the East and one player in the West who need (and deserve) a late push from fans to make the starting 10.  * * * *  Cast your NBA All-Star 2018 vote! David Aldridge :  I go back and forth between Victor Oladipo and Bradley Beal in the East. Both have had great first halves and been the most important players for their respective teams. Beal\u2019s Wizards are doing a little better overall. But Oladipo has done so much with far less proven help in Indiana than Beal has had in Washington. Oladipo\u2019s not just averaging more points, but is shooting a better percentage both (.492 to Beal\u2019s .453) and on 3-pointers (.421 to .366). (And \u2026 Oladipo attended the most successful high school in the history of the United States of America \u2014 DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Md.\u2013 as your humble author also did. One DeMatha! \ud83d\ude42 ) In the West, Jimmy Butler \u2014 the catalyst for the Wolves\u2019 dramatic rise into a top-four team in the conference \u2014 all day long. He\u2019s currently 10th among West guards , and while Chris Paul (sixth) is an all-time great, he\u2019s been out a lot this season, as has Damian Lillard (seventh). Lonzo Ball (eighth) \u2026 come on. And Devin Booker (ninth) is a raft of excellence in an algae-filled Suns pool. Steve Aschburner : I was actually pretty OK with the starting 10 that popped up from the first round of All-Star balloting. But I\u2019ll play along and say Victor Oladipo in the East and Russell Westbrook in the West . Oladipo hasn\u2019t been better than either Kyrie Irving or DeMar DeRozan but he has been terrific, while shouldering so much more grief as the scoffed-at key piece on the Pacers\u2019 side of the Paul George trade. Starting the All-Star Game would be a cherry-on-top sort of vindication. Westbrook might land a starting spot on his own in that three-headed monster of a West backcourt but then, do you hold out Stephen Curry or James Harden? The way the game has gone, it probably should have three guards and two \u201cfrontcourt\u201d guys per squad, but that\u2019s a topic for another blogtable. Shaun Powell :  I think the fans are spot on so far in both conferences, especially in the East , with LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozan and Joel Embiid. I just don\u2019t see anyone deserving to crack that top five. In the West, you could maybe nit pick with James Harden getting one of the backcourt spots over Russell Westbrook ONLY if Harden misses a lot of time with hamstring issues. Otherwise, the fans are 2-for-2. John Schuhmann : If I have to make a change in the East , I\u2019d push both DeMar DeRozan and Victor Oladipo over Kyrie Irving . It\u2019s actually pretty remarkable how evenly those three guys measure up, but DeRozan and Oladipo are the key cogs on offenses that rank fifth and eighth in the league , respectively, while the Celtics\u2019 success has been more about defense. In the West, I\u2019d push for Karl-Anthony Towns over DeMarcus Cousins for the third frontcourt spot . Cousins has the better points\/rebounds\/assists numbers, but that\u2019s mostly about usage. Towns has been the more efficient scorer and better defender (after some early-season struggles on that end of the floor), as well as more of a difference maker in regard to his team\u2019s success.  Sekou Smith : This is tough. It\u2019s hard to argue with the first returns on both sides of the conference divide. That said, Kevin Love has been stellar for the Cavaliers this season and I wouldn\u2019t argue with him being in that Eastern Conference first five , were the Love fans out there so inclined to make it happen. Out West , I think that for all the struggles the Oklahoma City Thunder have endured this season, Russell Westbrook has been an absolute monster. The Thunder needed some time to figure things out, and they are still working through some issues, but Russ is right back to the triple-double ways the fueled his Kia MVP campaign last season . I\u2019ve got no problem at all with him finding his way into that Western Conference starting five, were it to happen."},{"id":42412,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-how-do-cleveland-cavaliers-fix-their-defense","date":"2018-01-10","title":"Blogtable: How can Cleveland Cavaliers fix their defensive issues?","content":" * * * Cleveland has lost six of its last nine and has given up 127 points in back-to-back games. What is wrong with the Cavs\u2019 defense, and how do they fix it?  * * * David Aldridge :  A lot of things. Among the chief ones, though, is that the Cavs don\u2019t seem to be nearly as good with Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love together on the floor. When Thompson was out, and Love was playing center, Cleveland attacked opponents with traps and switched all over the floor, out of necessity as much as innovation \u2014 the undersized Love couldn\u2019t spend all night banging in the paint against guys 20-30 pounds heavier. And, it worked well enough; Cleveland\u2019s defensive rating in November wasn\u2019t great ( 107.2, 21st in the league ), but the Cavs were\/are so productive offensively, with Love having an All-Star caliber start, they just outscored a lot of people. But Iman Shumpert went down at the end of November to arthroscopic knee surgery , and Thompson\u2019s return in mid-December has not helped; Cleveland defensive rating fell significantly in December ( 109.7, 26th ). Thompson has just one double-figure rebounding game in the 12 games since his return, and he\u2019s blocked just three shots overall since coming back. There\u2019s a reason you keep hearing Cleveland linked via the rumor mill to DeAndre Jordan. It\u2019s not all Thompson or Shumpert, but there\u2019s something not right there. Steve Aschburner : It would be nice if the Cavaliers could just go into the gym and strategize their way to stingier defense. All they\u2019d need to work on would be their methods against pick-and-roll plays \u2026 and running shooters off the 3-point line \u2026 and defending better in the paint. See, there\u2019s so much to which they must attend. This is bigger than tweaks. There\u2019s energy missing, there\u2019s effort missing and there\u2019s hunger missing from Cleveland\u2019s game (roster?) now. Adding Isaiah Thomas was an offensive boost but a defensive step back. Nothing is going to bail these guys out short of being scared straight, snapping out of the \u201ctoo cool for the regular season\u201d malaise and realizing bad habits are hard to shake. Shaun Powell :  The players with the best defensive reputations have slipped a bit (Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith and especially Jae Crowder), making the Cavs more vulnerable than expected. Short of making a trade for DeAndre Jordan (don\u2019t hold your breath because the Cavs have little to trade other than maybe Thompson), this is what the Cavs must live with. Still, I continue to believe the Cavs, like most of the very best contenders, just want to get through the season. It\u2019s the Boredom Factor. John Schuhmann : What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s the regular season. How do they fix it? Get to the playoffs. Last season taught us that LeBron James and his team have the ability to flip the switch on that end of the floor. After ranking 29th defensively after the All-Star break and 13th in the first round , they defended well against the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics over the next nine games. Of course, in The Finals, they had no chance defending the best offense we\u2019ve ever seen, and the bad habits ( laziness in transition and miscommunication on switches ) that had built up made that more difficult. So yeah, they needed to start fixing things three months ago. Good (and bad) defense starts in transition, where only the Rockets have allowed their opponents to get a greater percentage of their possessions than the Cavs have (16.1 percent) . The Cavs also don\u2019t force their opponents to take inefficient shots; Only Oklahoma City and the Lakers have allowed their opponents to take a greater percentage of their shots from the restricted area or 3-point range, and the 11.9 3-pointers per game the Cavs have allowed would be the second most in NBA history (behind only the 12.1 the Kings are allowing). When the team you\u2019ve got your sights on is the Golden State Warriors, that stat is one that should scare you.  Sekou Smith : Didn\u2019t we ask a similar questions months ago when the Cavaliers were 5-7 and everyone was freaking out? Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to mess with the messenger. They don\u2019t play any, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the Cavaliers\u2019 defense these days. The Cavaliers were built for defense when LeBron James first returned to Cleveland. But that\u2019s not who they are anymore. Once they decided they\u2019d rather beat the Golden State Warriors by playing the Warriors\u2019 way \u2014 rather than try to stop them with a defensive-minded scheme of their own \u2014 the gradual personnel shift and change in focus took over.

LaVine, who was acquired in a draft-day trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves, is expected to play Saturday when the Bulls host the Pistons. His debut comes 11 months after he had surgery on a torn ACL in his left knee. It also falls on the same night the Bulls plan to give away LaVine\u2019s likeness to fans. \u201cIs it really?\u201d LaVine said when he learned about the giveaway. \u201cOh wow. I do get to play a game before the bobble comes back. The PR people are probably happy.\u201d The rest of the organization is pretty pleased, too. LaVine averaged 18.9 points per game for Minnesota last season. He hasn\u2019t played since he tore his ACL during a Feb. 3 game against Detroit. The 22-year-old had surgery on Feb. 14 and was traded to Chicago along with Kris Dunn and the pick used to select first-rounder Lauri Markkanen. Thanks to a tireless rehab regimen, LaVine is ready to get back on the court for the team\u2019s final 40 games. His return should give the Bulls\u2019 front office a lengthy enough look at a player who is set to become a restricted free agent after the season ends. John Paxson, Chicago\u2019s executive vice president of basketball operations, said Tuesday that the team initially intends to limit LaVine to 20 minutes per game to ease him back into the rotation. Paxson said the team hasn\u2019t decided whether LaVine will start or come off the bench. Chicago won\u2019t play LaVine in the second game of consecutive contests on Feb. 9-10 for precautionary reasons, Paxson said. \u201cThis is the continuation and ending of his rehab,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re going to continue a conservative approach with him. He has done everything at such a top level getting back ready to play. And I know he\u2019s really anxious to.\u201d Though he possibly could have returned Wednesday, when the Bulls visit the New York Knicks, LaVine\u2019s representatives and the Bulls made the determination at a Monday meeting to wait a few more days. After returning to practice in late November and undergoing a training camp-like session through early January, LaVine said he\u2019s ready for the next step in his return. He also understands why they team intends to be cautious with him at first. \u201cI\u2019m OK with everything,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be OK with that. That\u2019s where you start, I know it\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just part of getting back. Even though I\u2019m back, it\u2019s the last part of me getting back with the little bit of restriction. \u201cI know how to play, I know the way I want to play. I know it\u2019s going to take a little time to get the rhythm back. But regardless I think I can do some things.\u201d Coach Fred Hoiberg is excited to insert LaVine into the team\u2019s up-tempo style of offense. LaVine shot 46 percent from the field and 39 percent of his 3-point tries last season. After a slow start offensively, Chicago has averaged 109.6 points per game over its last 18 contests. \u201c(LaVine) does fit with how we are playing right now, pace has been really good,\u201d Hoiberg said. \u201cReally the last month of the season, the guys are starting to understand and get out and run and get things accomplished early in the possession, and Zach certainly fits into that as well, so he\u2019s a guy who can shoot it \u2013 you have a lot of plays to get him shots coming off screens.

(AP) \u2014 Golden State coach Steve Kerr called LaVar Ball \u201cthe Kardashian of the NBA\u201d on Monday night, and said he thinks the father of Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball has zero credibility.

He was asked about LaVar Ball after the demonstrative dad told ESPN that the Lakers no longer want to play for coach Luke Walton, a dear Kerr friend and former top assistant with the Warriors. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, president of the National Basketball Coaches Association, has called the ESPN article \u201ca disgrace\u201d and LaVar Ball\u2019s comments an \u201cignorant distraction.\u201d \u201cSomewhere, I guess in Lithuania, LaVar Ball is laughing at all of us.

There is nothing interesting about that story.\u201d Kerr is in regular touch with Walton and hates to see him in this position.

From Jan Indra : No. The Wolves are a top-four team in the West for the first time since the KG\/Sprewell\/Cassell Years; why on earth would they have been better without Butler, who\u2019s provided them with All-Star level play while not dominating the ball (24.6 usage rate entering play this weekend), and who\u2019s only 28? I\u2019m a big Dunn guy, and LaVine obviously has great potential, but potential tends to get players beat and coaches fired. Minnesota had to speed up the rebuild and did so without mortgaging its future; it\u2019s got a tremendous nucleus, a strong coach\/management in place and a legit contending window for the next several years. What\u2019s not to like? No Country for Old Men. From Ralph Sacdalan : I was initially set to dismiss your suggestion out of hand, Ralph, having seen a lot of former great players blow out assorted hamstrings, ACLs and Achilles\u2019 when the NBA had old-timers\u2019 games during All-Star Weekend in the late 80s. But I gave it some more thought, and I figured, well, Ice Cube\u2019s league is halfcourt, not full-court, and most of those guys came through the season unscathed. If you were thus talking about one half-court game for coaches at All-Star, maybe. And I think players would go nuts seeing their coaches out there shooting (or missing), maybe lucking into a crossover that doesn\u2019t stick, etc. But, man: can you imagine the blowback if an active head coach went down with a significant injury? And on the seventh day, He sat in front of his big screen and watched playoff games. From Mathias Gjerlow : Well, it\u2019s not up to me, of course, Mathias, but I think I understand the question. If it was my call, I think I\u2019d find a way to get Terrance Ferguson onto the floor at Staples for the dunk contest, along with Orlando\u2019s Aaron Gordon, maybe Toronto\u2019s O.G. Anunoby ( this was nice , but he had a whole bunch of sick ones like this at Indiana in college ) and\u2026the Freak. ( Dear God .) For the 3-point contest, I\u2019d obviously invite defending champ Eric Gordon back. As for the rest\u2026how about his Rockets teammate James Harden (assuming his hamstring is healed by then, of course) Philly\u2019s Robert Covington, Miami\u2019s Wayne Ellington, the Wizards\u2019 Bradley Beal, OKC\u2019s Paul George, Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry and, if I have eleventy billion dollars with which to coerce him, Steph Curry.

The Greek Freak was the leading vote getter among all players in the first round, with Kevin Durant leading Western Conference players in votes with 7678,402. The leading vote getter in each conference will get to pick his team from the pool of players both voted in by fans and selected by coaches. Not being stupid, Antetokounmpo said last week that he\u2019d take LeBron James if he winds up with the first pick. 1) I agree with Paul Pierce . A jersey retirement is a special, emotional \u2014 and singular night for the honoree. He shouldn\u2019t have to share it with anyone, even another great player from that organization. Pierce is certainly a finalist in the Celtics\u2019 Mount Rushmore, following Russell, Havlicek and Bird; the fourth could be among any of Pierce, K.C. and\/or Sam Jones, Bob Cousy and a few others. Point is, the Truth was one of the greatest players in franchise history, and while Isaiah Thomas had two great seasons there, that\u2019s not the same. Circumstances sometimes make for hard choices. In this case, I\u2019d wait until the playoffs or until next season to give IT his video tribute. 2) Charlotte, showing a pulse out West by winning three out of four, including beating the Dubs in Oakland, now has a chance to get back in the playoff chase in the East, with eight of its next nine games at home. 3) Alabama, he said with no particular conviction, over Georgia tonight. 4)  A quad ! Congrats to Grambling\u2019s Shakyla Hill for achieving the elusive stat-stuffer last week in the Tigers\u2019 win over Alabama State, just the fourth time a player in women\u2019s Division I history has done so. 1) There is, apparently, no place east of Las Vegas where it isn\u2019t currently 13 degrees with a wind chill of -7.

So went the gender reveal at Bankers Life Fieldhouse late last month, when Damien Wilkins and his fianc\u00e9e Jasmine Mitchell found out who would be joining them later this year in Indiana. (I am much, much too old to understand how gender reveal parties have become a thing. We didn\u2019t know the sex of our first child until he was born, and we didn\u2019t want to know.) That Wilkins was in Indiana at all was one of the cool stories of this season \u2014 one that came to an end, at least temporarily, when the team requested waivers on him . (Indiana could, conceivably, look at bringing Wilkins back after the trade deadline, one league source said Sunday afternoon.) At 37, Wilkins worked his way back to the NBA after four years away; he\u2019d last played with the 76ers in 2013. But he thought he had more to give, so he\u2019s spent the last four years playing around the world \u2014 China, Venezuela, Puerto Rico \u2014 along with G League stints in Iowa and Greensboro. But Wilkins continued to believe he would be back in the NBA. He worked in the Players Association\u2019s management training program at the Summer League in Las Vegas in July, and the Pacers\u2019 GM, Kevin Pritchard, ran into him during the \u201cspeed dating\u201d portion of the meeting between the teams and the players, who were and are interested in front office careers. The Pacers brought him to camp on a non-guaranteed deal, and he made the team, playing in 19 games. But his biggest role was as a veteran who could help some of the team\u2019s young players through the ups and downs of an NBA season. The only thing about Wilkins getting released from his standpoint may be that at least he\u2019ll get to watch his alma mater, the University of Georgia, play in the college football national championship game tonight against Alabama. The Pacers are playing Milwaukee tonight; Wilkins had been working with people at Bankers Life Fieldhouse to get regular updates during the game. This interview was done Saturday, before the team decided to let Wilkins go. Me: I know Georgia\u2019s a football school; were you tight with any of the football players back when you were there? Damien Wilkins: Back then, it was like an immature competition between us and them. It took me a while to realize that that was just a competition we weren\u2019t going to win as basketball players. It took me leaving to realize that. Guys like D. J. Shockley was there while I was there. Fred Gibson was there. The guy that works on ESPN now, David Pollack. I was there with those guys. They had a good team them. You know, Georgia always represents the SEC well. If you\u2019re a Bulldog, it\u2019s a proud time right now. Me: What\u2019s that feeling like for you? DW: It feels good. Like I said, it\u2019s a proud time to be a Bulldog right now. I\u2019m sure no one went to class this week. Everyone\u2019s already in Atlanta. I think that more than anything is what\u2019s special about it, because they\u2019re playing that game actually at home. To play that game in our home state, that kind of makes it even more special. It\u2019s surreal, I\u2019m sure, for those guys. Kirby Smart has done a great job. He\u2019s completely turned that thing around, man. He\u2019s got it going in a direction even more so than it was before. Not that we had fallen off any at all, but he\u2019s getting some great recruits. People are staying home to play at Georgia. I mean this guy Jake Fromm is unreal, man. It\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s a true freshman. We\u2019re extremely proud of those guys right now. But we\u2019ve got a tough task ahead of us, because Alabama sure looked like they played with a chip on their shoulder against Clemson. Me: I think JaMychal Green is the only Alabama guy playing in the league right now. You got any bets down with any \u2018Bama guys? DW: One of our video coordinators, one of our video coordinator interns went to \u2018Bama. We haven\u2019t spoken all week. He\u2019s been wearing his \u2018Bama gear; I\u2019ve been wearing my Georgia gear. So we got a little thing going on right now. Me: What has it been like being back in the league this year? DW: It\u2019s been great. I remember seeing you in Vegas (at the Summer League), and we were talking. I can\u2019t really put it into words. The game has changed so much since the last time I was playing in Philly four years ago. I\u2019m fortunate enough to have been playing and keeping my eye and focus on the game. It\u2019s nothing that surprised me, but it\u2019s been great. It\u2019s just been unbelievable. The experience of being back here and helping these young guys, getting the opportunity to play here and there being back on the floor, being in this element has meant everything to me and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve been working for the past four years. So many people told me I was dumb to play in the D League for two years, I was dumb not to go to Europe and go get money over there, I was dumb to think that this would happen again. It\u2019s just a testament to the perseverance that I had that I was not going to give up until there was just no way out. During that time that I\u2019ve been away, no one was telling me there wasn\u2019t a chance. No one that was able to make decisions for me, basically, was saying \u2018no, you don\u2019t have a chance.\u2019 That\u2019s not what I was hearing. So I was going to give it all that I had to be back. And now that I\u2019m back, it\u2019s just unbelievable. Me: So how has the game changed in the last four years? DW: It\u2019s a lot faster, that\u2019s for sure. You can tell that people now are like, in a hurry to get the ball. That\u2019s how it seems. Everyone\u2019s in a hurry to say, okay, go ahead. Literally, go ahead and score so we can get the ball back. That\u2019s exactly what it feels like sometimes. Everyone\u2019s like, we want to score, so do what you gotta do so we can get the ball inbounds so we can score. And the teams that play defense are the teams at the top of the league. It\u2019s not rocket science. I\u2019m surprised everyone hasn\u2019t figured that out yet. You look at the Spurs and Golden State, even with their frantic pace, they still defend well. Boston is at the top of the league in defensive rating. Toronto, all those teams at the top. Houston has a better defensive roster this year, so it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re at the top of the league. That\u2019s the changes I see; the game is a lot faster and everyone\u2019s in such a hurry to get baskets, or to get shot attempts. Me: You\u2019re one of the last active guys who actually played in Seattle. What are your memories from there? DW: I was there three years, four years. I had a great time. That\u2019s an unbelievable city, it\u2019s an unbelievable sports town. Great food, great people, great atmosphere to play basketball, and to play any sport. Look at the Seahawks. It\u2019s just a sports town. I miss it there. It\u2019s a shame that a team isn\u2019t there, and those people there, I know they miss having themselves a basketball team, and hopefully one day it\u2019ll happen. I miss it every day. It\u2019s a great place to play. One of my favorite places. I was fortunate enough to be there my first year. That city kind of raised me \u2014 myself and Nick Collison and even KD for the year that he was there. It was just a great time. Me: When Nate told you he wanted you to be a mentor to the young guys, did you accept that role immediately, or was there any part of you that said, \u2018Hold up \u2014 I can still hoop a little?\u2019 DW: He knew that. He said it to me. He said, I know you still can give us something and I\u2019m probably going to need you at some point. I just don\u2019t know if I need you immediately. And he said to keep up, to stay ready, which he knew I was going to do, anyway. He just said, I\u2019m going to need you to help me with these young guys, call upon you. I obviously know you\u2019re going to be ready. I know you can still play. I said I\u2019ve been waiting four years to hear that. I\u2019m here. I understand how long the season is. The foundation of my career was built on being ready when the opportunity came. It wasn\u2019t anything that was new to me. I\u2019m good with that. As long as I can impact and help these guys mature and grow and be more professional, that\u2019s fine with me. At the end of the day, when it\u2019s all said and done, I really do want to work in the NBA. I want to work in a front office. I want to be a front office exec one day. If that means starting from the coaching standpoint and moving up, that\u2019s fine, too. I\u2019m actually learning on the fly how to lead. I have no problem with that at all. It\u2019s been great so far. I just had dinner last night with Myles Turner. He and I sat and talked for a while. He got some things off his chest that\u2019s been kind of bothering him, and I told him how I felt about some things. Hopefully that helped. It\u2019s things like that that a lot of people probably wouldn\u2019t do. I told him, I don\u2019t ever want to have a regret where I didn\u2019t have that conversation with you. I don\u2019t want to leave here and have it be, man, I wish I would have spoken with him. Man, I wish I would have said this or done that. That was a good thing. He said he lacked veteran leadership in the past, and he appreciated that. And that right there made me feel like my purpose is here. This is the job I\u2019m called to do, and I\u2019m going to do it the best that I can. Me: How are the young guys coming along, like Myles and Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis? DW: We\u2019re coming along fine. We\u2019re coming along just like a young team would. We\u2019ve lost five in a row, so young guys respond to things the way you expect young guys to respond. After you lose two, guys\u2019 confidence gets a little low, or you start to see a little slippage as far as our togetherness goes. But that\u2019s with youth, and that\u2019s with maturity. Guys that have been around before like myself understand that damn near every team in the league goes through a spell where they lose a few in a row. But the good teams, the great teams bounce back. We\u2019ve got an opportunity to bounce back\u2026how this league goes, you get a win, it cures everything. We\u2019re one win away from guys being back, getting our heads back right and getting our confidence back right. Me: So, when\u2019s the last time you got either your dad or your uncle out on the floor? DW: Oh, man, it\u2019s been a while. I don\u2019t think either one of them want to get out there with me. They just talk about it. I was just with \u2018Nique in Atlanta, and he was like, \u2018Yeah, man, I can do this. I can go out and get 15 right now.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t \u2014 not with all the screens these guys are running off of. No, you can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShaneBattier\/status\/949723169736323078 \u2014 Former NBA player and current Heat exec Shane Battier ( @ShaneBattier ), Saturday, 2:23 p.m., breaking down an imaginary one-on-one game with former President Barack Obama.

I know she would want me to do that. Whenever I get down on myself or get down on life, I just try to revert to my work and ask myself, \u2018What would she want me to do?\u2019 Because she was my biggest supporter.

But the present is grim, with each franchise facing significant short-term and long-term challenges. Both L.A. teams are struggling mightily this season. Neither is in the top eight in the Western Conference at present, with the Clippers two games behind the Pelicans for the last playoff berth in the West. The last time neither the Lakers nor Clippers made the playoffs was 2004-05, which happened to be the season after the Lakers traded Shaquille O\u2019Neal to the Heat, and finished 34-48. The latest ignominy was Blake Griffin\u2019s frightening fall and concussion suffered in Saturday\u2019s blowout loss to the Warriors after being inadvertently elbowed in the head by JaVale McGee. Griffin left the game and did not return and there\u2019s no word how long he\u2019ll be out, though the early word is he was feeling better Sunday. It was the latest in an unbelievable stretch of injuries for the Clippers, which has already claimed Patrick Beverley (right lateral meniscus surgery) for the season, Danilo Gallinari (torn glute) just before Christmas, Milos Teodosic (plantar fasciitis) and Austin Rivers (heel\/Achilles\u2019) for the past week and for at least two more to come. Only Lou Williams has been capable of staying both healthy and productive most of the season. The other NBA tenant at Staples Center isn\u2019t faring any better. First-round pick Lonzo Ball\u2019s return from an injured shoulder last week didn\u2019t bring immediate improvement, and his father is ranting and raving about the direction of the team and the abilities of Coach Luke Walton from 11 time zones away. The son\u2019s struggles shooting the ball and making an impact have not been worth the father\u2019s outbursts, which have continued even as team president Magic Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka told him earlier in the fall to knock off the public verbal shots . The post-Chris Paul era for the Clippers was already complicated, with Doc Rivers losing his title as president of basketball operations last summer, and owner Steve Ballmer overseeing a restructuring of the front office that included Ballmer bringing in Jerry West as a consultant. One does not bring in Jerry West to consult and then ignore his ideas and suggestions, which a lifetime of success has entitled West to have. Add to that DeAndre Jordan\u2019s potential free agency this summer \u2014 he has a player option for next season that would pay him $24.1 million. The sense that everybody is auditioning for their jobs next season is palpable. \u201cWith that, it\u2019s a positive, too,\u201d Jordan said last week. \u201cEverybody\u2019s playing for something, playing with a chip on their shoulder. When you\u2019ve got a group of guys like that, it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t know (what\u2019s going to happen). That\u2019s out of my control. I\u2019m just focusing on playing right now and winning as many games as we can, and individually, focusing on being a better player.\u201d Even the unexpected successes of some of the Clippers\u2019 young players has been double-edged. For example, the Clippers are caught between a rock and a hard place with guard C.J. Williams, the 27-year-old rookie who\u2019s been playing solid ball for them in the absence of all the guards. But Williams is on a two-way deal, and getting dangerously close to the 45-day limit placed on teams who sign such players before they have to give them NBA veteran minimum deals. But Los Angeles is hard-capped this year and definitely is not going to make itself susceptible to repeater taxes by going into the luxury tax to keep Williams. Other teams know that, and aren\u2019t willing to trade for him, knowing the Clippers will have to release him soon. Someone will scarf him up in a second. Meanwhile, the Lakers ended their franchise-record home losing streak Sunday night at Staples by beating Atlanta, but it was a small salve. At 12-27, they\u2019re tied for the third-worst record in the league with Memphis, but while they plummet to earth faster than Skylab (kids! Ask your aunt and uncle what Skylab was), they won\u2019t get the benefit of a high Lottery pick as compensation in June. Their first-round pick, sent long ago to Phoenix as part of the Steve Nash trade, will either be going to Philly (if the Lakers win the Lottery, or if the pick falls between 6 and 30 in the first round) or\u2026Boston, which will get it if the Lakers\u2019 pick fall between 2 and 5 in the Lottery. So either the Celtics or Sixers will add yet another young, dominant piece to their roster, on a rookie contract lasting for several years, while the Lakers get nothing. The Lakers buoyed that disappointment with the hopes of adding two max players in free agency in July. Paul George, likely their chief target (and an expensive one, after the team was fined $500,000 by the NBA in August for what the league said was improper contact between Pelinka and George\u2019s representatives at CAA). The league\u2019s investigation, launched after the Pacers filed tampering charges against the Lakers, did not uncover any implicit or tangible evidence that there was already a deal in place between the Lakers and George. George got a warm ovation from the crowd at Staples last week when he and the Thunder visited. But let\u2019s just say the Lakers\u2019 play so far this season isn\u2019t making any of the prospective difference makers who\u2019d be available this summer believe the team\u2019s young core is ready for any type of serious postseason run. At any rate, before they can sign anyone, the Lakers will need to find a taker for guard Jordan Clarkson, who has two years and $26 million left on his deal through 2020 to clear enough room for two maxes. And it\u2019s hard at present to see that happening; Clarkson does not currently carry high value around the league. Meanwhile, Julius Randle, the Lakers\u2019 2014 first-round pick, is playing the best basketball of his career, averaging 13.2 points and 6.7 rebounds off the bench in 23 minutes a night. He\u2019s shooting a career-best 56 percent from the floor. He has earned Sixth Man of the Year consideration. In a normal year, that would be cause for celebration. But since the whole idea was to clear cap space for the Summer of 2018, the last thing the Lakers want is to tie up room in Randle, a restricted free agent. They weren\u2019t looking to re-sign him at all, but now that he\u2019s playing great, the idea of letting him walk for nothing doesn\u2019t seem like a good resolution, either. The Lakers\u2019 nosedive has stifled the initial excitement the team had with the emergence of rookie Kyle Kuzma and the offensive development of second-year forward Brandon Ingram. The team had a players\u2019 only meeting in late December, and it couldn\u2019t be encouraging to hear Kuzma say after in the last week that the team \u201cquit\u201d against the Thunder Wednesday, and that he needs to play harder. \u201cWe\u2019re just not getting into our identity consistently,\u201d Kuzma told me in December. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be a defensive team, and I feel like some nights we take nights off from that. When we do that, we\u2019re not the best shooting team, so we definitely have to improve on shooting threes. That\u2019s such a big part of the game. That will help our whole game out, if we can start knocking down open threes.\u201d The Lakers retired Kobe Bryant\u2019s jersey last month, offering a last tribute to their iconic player. The hope was that by now, almost two years since Bryant\u2019s last game as a player, that the team would have moved past his greatness, and decline, and that its young core would have started to establish its own identity. Unfortunately, the Mamba\u2019s presence is still larger than life, and still defining his franchise\u2019s inability to move past what he accomplished, and the standards for excellence he set. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The future was not to be brooded over; there wasn\u2019t portent in either Paul George\u2019s parents sitting courtside Wednesday, just a quick hour\u2019s drive from the family\u2019s hometown of Palmdale, nor in his going over to hug them during the game. Or maybe there was. But in back-to-back wins over the Lakers and Clippers , the Thunder displayed what they could be in May and June \u2014 which may not matter by July. Such is the conundrum OKC has been in since it went all in this year \u2014 acquiring George from Indiana and Carmelo Anthony from New York just before the start of training camp, knowing that both George and Anthony have player options for the 2018-19 season (George will otherwise get $20.7 million next year; Anthony, $27.9 million), and that George made it clear last year while with the Pacers that he\u2019d like to return to L.A. next summer and play for the Lakers. The task for the Thunder remains to convince George there\u2019s a long-term, multi-year path to the Finals that runs through Chesapeake Energy Arena. OKC\u2019s cupboard isn\u2019t bare: getting George helped convince Russell Westbrook to a five-year, $205 million extension through 2023. In turn, knowing Westbrook now isn\u2019t going to explore free agency in 2018, George is more inclined to give the Thunder a real look this summer. Yet that will further depend on what OKC does in the playoffs: will the Thunder be a legit threat to the Warriors or Rockets or Spurs in the West, or just second-round fodder? But, today, the educated sense is that OKC has impressed enough, especially after a rocky November on the floor, to be in a primary position to keep George this summer. That doesn\u2019t mean, if two superstars are determined to play together, that George couldn\u2019t still bounce. But the landscape is favorable to the Thunder. Westbrook is 29 and in his prime; Anthony has acquiesced to the Chris Bosh\/Kevin Love role, and the Thunder have shown since moving to Oklahoma City that they are always willing to make another deal, flip another asset, to surround its core group with developing talent. \u201cLike I said, at the end of the day, only I would know, in terms of what\u2019s the right move in terms of where we place, where we finish, how I feel, together,\u201d George said Thursday, before the Thunder played the Clippers. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave a team where\u2026at the end of the day, all I wanted was to win. That\u2019s what I wanted in Indiana; I wanted to win, and win at a high level. So I will determine that once this season is up. I like what we have here. I love this locker room, I love this organization. They\u2019ve been unbelievable. Teaming up with Russ has been unbelievable. I think everybody knows where, ultimately, I stated where I wanted to play. But at the same time, I\u2019m putting all that aside. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m happy with this situation.\u201d Everyone is on their best behavior, not wishing to offend. It\u2019s hard not to think about the classic Twilight Zone episode where a six-year-old boy, not necessarily evil but certainly not a blessing, had unlimited, omniscient powers , and made people and cities and anything he didn\u2019t like disappear, never to return. What choice does OKC have, other than to do everything George wants, lest he wish their franchise into the cornfield by going to L.A.? But George says he can\u2019t ask more from the Thunder so far than what they\u2019ve done, on and off the court. \u201cThey\u2019ve matched everything,\u201d he said. \u201cOklahoma has definitely matched any, a player \u2014 especially a star player in this league \u2014 wants out of an organization. They\u2019ve matched everything I think I could check off.\u201d OKC, as ever, keeps its cards clutched tight to what must be, after all these years, the world\u2019s most uncomfortable vest. While George has been \u201coff the charts,\u201d on and off the court, one league source says, the Thunder aren\u2019t taking any chances, and aren\u2019t pressing George to agree to a long-term deal, hoping to be in maximum bargaining position this summer. The Thunder were awful out of the gate \u2014 a 4-9 November included losses to Sacramento, Dallas and Orlando, and left OKC with an 8-12 record at the season\u2019s quarter pole. George shot just 41.7 percent from the floor that month. But the Thunder began December with big consecutive wins over Minnesota and San Antonio, and the team\u2019s three stars started to figure out how best to work together. Read: George and Anthony patted the ball a little less, and let Westbrook pat it a lot more. Westbrook\u2019s usage rate had to come down from last season\u2019s insane 41.7, when he won MVP by controlling almost every possession from start to finish in averaging a triple-double for the season. But the 30.2 usage rate of October was way too big an adjustment. In November, it was 34.3. Last month, it was 37.1. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take away what he\u2019s great at \u2014 applying pressure, pushing the ball,\u201d Anthony said of Westbrook. \u201cHis toughness. What he brings to the game. As a result, he was MVP last year, and we don\u2019t want to take that away from him. This is his thing.\u201d Meanwhile, Anthony\u2019s usage rate dropped from 28.2 in October to 21.9 last month. He\u2019s not laying out in the short corner and waiting, exactly, but he\u2019s not the first look most of the time in the halfcourt \u2014 unless he\u2019s got a small on him after a switch. It\u2019s a role similar to that in which Anthony has always appeared happiest in recent years \u2014 his elder statesman pose at the Olympics in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016, an aging lion revered by the younger cubs. (It was not for nothing that OKC\u2019s promising first-round pick, Terrance Ferguson, said that he grew out his braids when he was a kid because of Carmelo \u2014 then begged me and the other reporters not to print that.) \u201cI\u2019ve accepted kind of what this team needs from me,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI think early on in the season, beginning of the season, it was like, all of us was like, we\u2019re just going to come in, do what we do and play our game. It doesn\u2019t work like that. It took a little bit of time for us to figure that part out.\u201d But the Thunder have also jumped within striking distance of a top four seed in the West by virtue of what it\u2019s done at the other end. OKC is currently fifth in the NBA in Defensive Rating (102.8), up from 10th last season. George may not be first team All-Defense as he was three years ago, but he\u2019s still awfully good. And paired on the wing with 2016-17 second team all-Defense recipient Andre Roberson, OKC can allow Westbrook to gamble and be hyper-aggressive on the ball. (Have to disagree with the Chuckster here .) Per NBA.com\/Stats, the Thunder lead the league in steals (9.5 per game), deflections per (18.3) and loose balls recovered per (9), and is top 10 in fast break points allowed (9.8 per game, seventh-best in the league) and overall field goal percentage allowed (47.9, seventh-best) and 3-point percentage allowed (35.7, eighth-best). \u201cPaul, maybe even more than Andre, than Russell\u2026Paul\u2019s got incredible range,\u201d Coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times, I think even for offensive players, they think passes can get through. And just his ability to get into passing lanes and deflect balls has been really impressive.\u201d Donovan and his staff made some schematic changes to the Thunder\u2019s defense from last season, too. \u201cThe subtle differences are really just, we\u2019re back to, when a drive\u2019s coming, we\u2019re helping, not thinking about it, and then rotating and solving problems,\u201d said veteran forward Nick Collison, the team\u2019s longest-tenured player. \u201cFor a while, we were trying to stay home on shooters sometimes, and help sometimes, and I think Coach was real good this year at the start of camp about just go, keep a tight paint and follow the rest later,\u201d Collison said. \u201cThere\u2019s this change in the league where everybody\u2019s shooting threes and we\u2019re all scared of it, but you\u2019ve still got to guard the rim first. We were bad at the rim the last couple of years, and with our talent, that shouldn\u2019t have been the case.\u201d Collison also cites further improvement from center Steven Adams, both as the quarterback of OKC\u2019s halfcourt defense and in being able to adjust in-game to what\u2019s happening on the floor. \u201cThe big thing is Steven just feeling, just understanding the game so much more, and understanding when to come help, when to stay, communicating pick and rolls,\u201d Collison said. \u201cThat\u2019s a little thing that people don\u2019t always realize, but it makes a huge difference \u2014 when to come over and clog, stuff like that. I think we\u2019ve got some more veteran guys to solve problems. When you can do that five or six times a game that you couldn\u2019t do before, that\u2019s a big difference.\u201d Adams says a tight paint also starts with OKC\u2019s guards getting into the ball more, and forcing opponents to trap spots, rather than depending on shot blockers like Serge Ibaka to protect the front of the rim. And he acknowledges he\u2019s better at calling out opponent looks earlier in the shot clock and getting that information disseminated. \u201cI feel with young guys, especially when I was young, it\u2019s very difficult to talk, get used to talking,\u201d Adams said. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got so much on your mind, and it\u2019s hard \u2014 you don\u2019t know what to say at that immediate time. Veterans know what to say, call (it) out. It definitely helps.\u201d When Roberson \u2014 currently out with patellar tendinitis in his left knee, and not expected back for at least another week \u2014 is on the floor, OKC has one of the top five-man defensive units in the league, even with the not-so-lockdown Anthony on the floor. The Thunder\u2019s starting five is a top-10 defensive unit among those that have played more than 100 minutes together this season, allowing just 96.3 points per 100 possessions . \u201cWe run off of our defense,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cWe feel when we defend at a high rate, offense is an easy fix. When we defend, we make sure that\u2019s all that we\u2019re about.\u201d OKC\u2019s successfully implemented some of the old Utah \u201cHawk\u201d actions that got Karl Malone, John Stockton or Jeff Hornacek open looks to get more movement when Westbrook, George and Anthony are together. Donovan experimented some with lineups where only one or none of them were on the floor. But experiments, by their nature, warn you what not to do much more than they reveal what you should. \u201cWe put the ball in (Westbrook\u2019s) hands and he makes us better,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cBut then there\u2019s times where he has to rely on us to make him better and make the game easier.\u201d Donovan knew George \u2014 playing the Hornacek role in Oklahoma City \u2014 wanted movement before touching the ball, and Anthony (Malone) could always use his strength on the block or elbows for bully ball postups and fadeaways if the clock got on the Thunder\u2019s back. Westbrook (Stockton) can be trusted to make the right read, and can get to the cup himself if need be against just about anyone, given that doubles and traps are far less likely to be effective with George and Anthony on the floor with him. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to think of things, end of games, or just even different situations, where you incorporate the three of them at the same time,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, okay, we like this matchup; let\u2019s just go at this matchup. I think on the Hawk, if Russell\u2019s being guarded by a point guard, and they switch, you can post Carmelo on a point guard. Paul\u2019s coming off of staggers, which he likes doing that. And you can play in pick and roll, and Russell\u2019s done a pretty good job manipulating it. And we\u2019ve tried to take some things out of that Hawk, and also run some things where the three of those guys are involved at the same time. But, when you have veteran guys, they\u2019re always talking about different things they can do out of it.\u201d There will still be direct posts and pick and rolls if there are specific mismatches on a given night. But OKC\u2019s getting more and more with the Hawk sets in crunch time, and Donovan\u2019s working on wrinkles as opponents get more cutups. \u201cI think it kind of keys and highlights everything that we\u2019re so good at,\u201d George said. \u201cPut \u2018Melo at the elbow, and he screens for me coming off, where I like to get movement, and pretty good off of movement. If they switch that, \u2018Melo\u2019s got a small on him, and I\u2019ve got a big chasing me. Then you\u2019ve got the pick and roll with Russ and \u2018Melo. How do you guard that? It\u2019s good that all three of us is in the action. Teams are going to have to figure out what they want to give up, or how they\u2019re going to guard that.\u201d OKC, though, is far from a finished product. The Thunder added Patrick Patterson from Toronto and Ray Felton from the Clippers to bolster its bench, but Patterson is struggling shooting so far (his .366 clip entering play Sunday would be the lowest of his seven-year career by far), and there\u2019s no proven size in reserve. The Clippers showed what damage a potential playoff opponent could do to the Thunder defensively, when DeAndre Jordan bludgeoned the Thunder inside off of every switch that resulted with Anthony on him. There aren\u2019t many playoff teams out West that could do that to Oklahoma City inside, but there are a couple \u2014 San Antonio and New Orleans come to mind. Plus, who is guarding Kevin Durant in a potential seven-gamer if the Thunder play Golden State? One would guess that that player or players may not yet be on the current Thunder roster. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d George said of a potential playoff run in the West. \u201cThey\u2019ve got star players like we\u2019ve got star players. That\u2019s not the part. I\u2019m not really worried. I like what we\u2019ve got in this locker room. We\u2019ve shown that we can beat them if we play at a high level. It\u2019s just going to come down to us having to do it over a series. But I like our chances.\u201d Presti has made an in-season deal in each of the last four years. The goal was of course to improve the team, but it was also to send a message to Westbrook \u2014 and, then, Durant: we\u2019re never going to stand pat and we\u2019re going to try and get you help. Sometimes it worked \u2014 oft-vilified James Harden trade in 2012 brought OKC the Draft pick that became Adams in 2013 \u2014 and sometimes it didn\u2019t (see Kevin Martin, Dion Waiters, etc.). But the willingness to take chances helps with George; he was impressed that the Thunder had the guts to go get him in the first place, knowing the circumstances and potential blowup in the franchise\u2019s face. George was impressed when owner Clay Bennett sent his private jet to pick him up for the introductory press conference in Oklahoma City. He was impressed when the staff knew the names of his family members. He\u2019s been impressed by the strong relationship that he\u2019s already forged with Presti and the front office. He knows Donnie Strack, the Thunder\u2019s Director of Medical Services, who grew up literally as a ball boy in the Pacers\u2019 organization and whose relationships and work with Pacers greats like Reggie Miller was the stuff of legend in Indy. It would be silly for George to tip his hand when he hasn\u2019t seen all his cards yet. Any combo of Banana Boat riders and him would be formidable anywhere, and the pull of Los Angeles is strong throughout the league. But the Thunder aren\u2019t folding, either. OKC has Westbrook, and it has Anthony, and it has George\u2019s Bird Rights, and that\u2019s way more than almost anybody else is showing at the moment. \u201cOf course, I keep saying L.A. is home, so it\u2019s always going to be a destination,\u201d George said. \u201cBut again, I\u2019ll be stupid if we make the conference finals, or we go neck and neck with the Warriors, and this being our first year together, I\u2019d be stupid to walk away from that.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Ball, the outspoken father of Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball, made his latest outlandish statement to ESPN for a story published Sunday. He said Walton is too young to coach and \u201chas no control\u201d of the team \u2013 comments that Walton said didn\u2019t bother him, but ones that clearly angered some of his NBA coaching colleagues. Carlisle, the National Basketball Coaches Association president, called the article \u201ca disgrace\u201d and LaVar Ball\u2019s words an \u201cignorant distraction.\u201d \u201cESPN is an NBA partner, and they\u2019ve been a great one,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cPart of that partnership is the coaches do a lot of things to help them with access, interviews, all those kinds of things, and in exchange for that, they should back up the coaches. Printing an article where the father of an NBA player has an opinion that\u2019s printed as anything legitimate erodes trust. It erodes the trust that we built with ESPN, and our coaches are upset. \u201cLuke Walton does not deserve that,\u201d Carlisle added. The Lakers were playing host to Atlanta on Sunday night, going into the game on a nine-game losing streak. At the team\u2019s morning shootaround, Walton said he is certain that he has the support of the Lakers\u2019 front office and that he was mostly concerned that Lonzo Ball could be adversely affected by his father\u2019s comments. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Walton said. \u201cMy only concern with any of it is for Zo. As long as Zo is fine with it and Zo can come in and play and it doesn\u2019t affect mine and his relationship, then it doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d Walton said before the game that some coaches have reached out to him after the comments. \u201cThey\u2019re all on the same idea of it\u2019s our job as coaches to coach our teams and not be concerned with parents and what other people outside the organization think,\u201d Walton said. \u201cA lot of them have shown their support as far as they know what it\u2019s like coaching young teams and from what they see, how hard our group plays, just like I do.\u201d Lonzo Ball did not seem affected one way or another. \u201cHe\u2019s going to speak his mind,\u201d Lonzo Ball said of his father. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to change.\u201d LaVar Ball made the comments in Lithuania, where Lonzo Ball\u2019s two younger brothers \u2013 LiAngelo Ball, 19, and LaMelo Ball, 16 \u2013 are now part of a team called BC Prienu Vytautas. LiAngelo Ball left UCLA after getting suspended and arrested for shoplifting during the Bruins\u2019 season-opening trip to China in November, and LaMelo Ball was removed from Chino Hills High in California so he could join the Lithuanian club. Calling out Walton is just the latest in an ongoing series of sagas. LaVar Ball has made headlines in the past for, among many other things, insisting that no other team should draft Lonzo Ball except the Lakers, placing a $495 price tag on the sneakers offered by his Big Baller Brand clothing line, saying he could beat Michael Jordan 1-on-1 and getting into a rift with President Donald Trump over how LiAngelo Ball was ultimately allowed to return to the U.S. following his shoplifting issue in China. LaVar Ball\u2019s comments on Walton overshadowed many other storylines in the same piece, including his prediction that LiAngelo Ball will play for the Lakers next season \u2013 and that LeBron James will leave Cleveland and join them. \u201cGet rid of everybody,\u201d LaVar Ball told ESPN. \u201cGive him LeBron and Gelo [LiAngelo Ball]. You got a 2 and a 3. And it\u2019s a win. It\u2019s a wrap.\u201d Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, whose team was in Dallas to face the Mavericks and Carlisle on Sunday, suggested that LaVar Ball doesn\u2019t know enough about the inner workings of NBA locker rooms to make conclusions on the coaching process. \u201cNobody\u2019s with these guys every day and when they have comments on teams, chemistry, that kind of stuff, they don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on in the overall picture,\u201d Hornacek said. \u201cYeah, there probably shouldn\u2019t be many comments from outside.\u201d"},{"id":48048,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-san-antonio-spurs-kawhi-leonard-suffers-tear-shoulder","date":"2018-01-08","title":"San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich says forward Kawhi Leonard suffered tear in shoulder","content":" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said that star forward Kawhi Leonard suffered a partial tear in his left shoulder during Friday\u2019s 103-89 win over Phoenix, according to a tweet from San Antonio Express-News reporter Tom Orsborn.

Porzingis is averaging 32.3 minutes for the New York Knicks, a workload that ranks him 55th in the league . The Timberwolves, meanwhile, have five starters \u2013 Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns and Jimmy Butler \u2014 in the top 36 in minutes . This is a rather historic cluster by Minnesota. Dating back to NBA expansion in the 1966-67 season, only three previous teams placed all five starters among the top 40 in minutes per game. The St. Louis Hawks did it twice (1967-68 and \u201969-70, after they had moved to Atlanta). And the \u201886-87 Boston Celtics did it en route to their fifth Finals in seven seasons. The Wolves are on pace to become the fourth, with their starters playing a combined 177.2 minutes per game, most in the NBA by a considerable margin and not that far off that Celtics team\u2019s all-time mark of 190.0. As a percentage of a team\u2019s available playing time, Boston\u2019s Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge logged 73.2 percent of the \u201986-87 Celtics\u2019 regular-season playing time ( 14,492 of 19,805 minutes ).  The 2017-18 Wolves? Their starters have played 69.6 percent of Minnesota\u2019s available time so far ( 6,563 of 9,435 ). The man in the middle of all those minutes, of course, is Tom Thibodeau. As both the Wolves\u2019 coach and their president of basketball operations, Thibodeau is charged with both the short-term success and long-term viability of that franchise, which makes his usage of players at times a source of controversy in the Twin Cities. When the Wolves lost six of 10 games from late November to early December \u2026 when they lost in overtime to Philadelphia Dec. 12 on a night when Thibodeau used only three reserves and pushed his each of his starters to 37 minutes and beyond \u2026 when they blew a 15-point lead at home and faltered badly down the stretch against Phoenix four nights later, Wolves fans, local and national media took turns wielding the broomstick to whack at the coach-as-pi\u00f1ata for grinding down his starters. Thibodeau was presumed to be as guilty now as he allegedly was during his run with the Chicago Bulls (2010-15) when charged with overusing players such as Butler, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose. Yet when the Wolves won six of their last seven games in December to reach 2018 at 23-14 \u2014 on pace for 51 victories and good for fourth place in the Western Conference standings \u2014 the grumbling all but stopped. Hoping to make it to May for the first time after 13 playoff-starved years, the Wolves might or might not use up their best players before they get to February. Minnesota went from a fourth-quarter mess in November, with a net rating in fourth quarters of minus-19.3 points per 100 possessions , to something dramatically better in December. Since Dec. 1, it ranks 17th with a plus-1.4 net rating in game\u2019s final quarters. As for Butler, the Wolves\u2019 hardest working player, he ranks third in the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring since Dec. 1 (9.4 ppg). So much for grinding down, wearing out or using up anybody.  Then Minnesota drops one it should have snagged \u2014 a 98-97 loss at Brooklyn Wednesday \u2013 as the Wolves get outscored in the fourth period and, just like that, the fretting bubbles to the surface. Sure enough, Thibodeau again faced questions about his heavy reliance on starters, his relative neglect of bench players and his thoughts on the NBA trend against big minutes in what fast is becoming a rest and recovery league. And always, his barking, growling sideline style makes it look like he\u2019s grinding on his guys even if they played just 10 minutes. \u201cI think every team is different,\u201d Thibodeau said in an interview Wednesday afternoon on KFAN in Minneapolis. \u201cIf you have younger players, you\u2019re going to play them a little bit more. If you have guys in their mid-30s, you\u2019re probably going to pull back on it. \u201cEverybody\u2019s different. When you look at the minutes in Houston are playing \u2014 and they\u2019re one of the elite teams in the league \u2014 they\u2019re winning their way.\u201d Thibodeau referenced the Rockets a couple of times, undoubtedly because veterans James Harden (36.3 minutes per game), Trevor Ariza (36.0), Eric Gordon (32.4) and Chris Paul (31.4) are playing long minutes for coach Mike D\u2019Antoni . While a lot of coaches are settling for the equivalent of quality starts \u2014 six innings or more, three earned runs or fewer \u2014 Thibodeau sometimes is cast as old-school Billy Martin .  \u201cI hear people say, \u2018Well, this guy\u2019s playing \u2026\u2019 Well, Karl\u2019s playing 35 minutes a game,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cWiggs is playing 36 minutes a game. Jimmy\u2019s probably up about 30 seconds more than he should be.\u201d Thirty whole seconds? Oh no. Some critics make it seem like the only safe and acceptable approach would be 10 players getting 24 minutes each. It\u2019s worth noting, by the way, that only four NBA players currently are averaging more than 37 minutes and none is topping 38. When the \u201986-87 Celtics set that record for starters\u2019 minutes, 19 players in the league averaged more than 37 minutes and eight averaged 38 or more. The current Celtics, who play host to the Timberwolves Friday have no one averaging more than Al Horford\u2019s 32.5 mpg . That\u2019s where baseball\u2019s revamped ethos toward complete games and long innings relates directly to the NBA\u2019s newer thoughts on playing time and days off. Like pitchers\u2019 precious arms, hoops stars\u2019 legs and bodies are valuable assets of limited resources. \u201cPlayers used to want to stay on the floor,\u201d one veteran coach said this week, \u201cbut now they\u2019re thinking about playing more years, because the salaries are so great. They don\u2019t want to get used up.\u201d Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, a few days before Porzingis discussed his fatigue , was asked what he considered to be too many minutes for an NBA player in 2017-18. \u201cI think one year in Phoenix I played 39 [actually 38.0 in 1991-92], so I don\u2019t know,\u201d Hornacek said. \u201cNowadays it looks like it might be 33.\u201d Said Chicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg: \u201cI played with Kevin Garnett, and he played 43 minutes one night. Then on the back-to-back, he played 45. Jimmy [Butler] had the unique ability to go out and play a full half. \u2026 Certain guys are just wired that way. A lot of it\u2019s on the individual. There are certain guys you can\u2019t throw out there for too long \u2014 they\u2019ll break down.\u201d That\u2019s the rap on Thibodeau, that he presided over some of the NBA\u2019s more unfortunate individual breakdowns and blowouts. Former Bulls forward Deng, for example, averaged 39.1 , 39.4 and 38.7 minutes in his first three seasons with Thibodeau. He had a series of nagging injuries before aging seemingly overnight, and for three seasons has been the shell of the All-Star player he once was. Noah was a two-time All-Star who won Kia Defensive Player of the Year and finished fourth in MVP balloting in 2014. He, too, embraced Thibodeau\u2019s work ethic and played through injuries until he couldn\u2019t. Noah missed 53 games in his final season with the Bulls and has appeared in only 52 of a possible 120 games since signing a four-year, $72-million deal with the Knicks. Rose remains the poster guy for careers waylaid by injuries, most traumatically his blown left ACL in the playoff opener of 2012 . The Bulls\u2019 point guard had missed 27 of the post-lockout 66-game schedule with various ailments before suffering his knee injury late in the Game 1 victory over Philadelphia , the outcome arguably no longer dependent on his services. Like many coaches, though, Thibodeau tends to think that the 21.5 hours each day a player is not playing in a game matters more than five or six extra minutes of competition. And the days in between matter, too, with body maintenance so important and with Thibodeau \u2014 unbeknownst to many \u2014 easing off the throttle in the frequency and intensity of Minnesota\u2019s practices. Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum said the prep time between games allows him (36.8) and backcourt mate Damian Lillard (36.9) to log big minutes. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable playing 48. That\u2019s what I prepare for in the summer,\u201d McCollum said, before correcting. \u201cWell, obviously you\u2019re not going to play 48 through the year but you want to get into the best shape you can. To be able to play overtime and withstand back-to-backs. That\u2019s just my mentality \u2014 take care of your body and when duty calls, you show up.\u201d At 26, McCollum doesn\u2019t sense a risk of breaking down from overuse. \u201cI do a great job taking care of my body \u2014 whether it\u2019s taking a massage, acupuncture, hot yoga, whatever it takes to get myself ready,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, the nights you have to play 40, 44 balance out and if you take care of your body, you\u2019ll be able to bounce back.\u201d Thibodeau faces an extra burden in the starters vs. bench dynamic. The Wolves\u2019 reserves must slice and dice fewer available minutes \u2014 62.8 on a typical night \u2014 than any other group of backups. And since the coach is the same guy who built the bench, his apparent limited trust in guys other than Jamal Crawford \u2014 Gorgui Dieng, Nemanja Bjelica, Shabazz Muhammad, Tyus Jones until recently \u2014 seems to reflect directly back on him. \u201cBut if you look in the box scores, there are a lot of teams that play guys [big minutes],\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to always play your main guys more minutes. \u201cNow, your depth may change that. Boston is a much deeper team. When you also look at scoring margins, there\u2019s probably more blowouts for them. But in close games, if you look at minutes, your main players are probably going to be playing 35 to 37, somewhere in there.\u201d Some coaches want to ration out their best players\u2019 exertions. Others feel that limiting court time also limits undue exposure to injuries. Then again, coaches like Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr aren\u2019t dragging around 13 consecutive seasons in Lotteryland as the Timberwolves are. \u201cI think people sometimes get caught up in the wrong stuff,\u201d Thibodeau said Thursday. \u201cThe most important thing is the winning.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

So you\u2019ll have to forgive him for not wasting his time worrying about what you or anyone else thinks. He knows who he is, where he stands in the league and his worth to the Washington Wizards. That doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have lofty goals this season, He wants on the Eastern Conference All-Star team and he\u2019s doing his part to make sure the Wizards live up to their own hype as an Eastern Conference contender. And he\u2019s never going to back off of his belief that he and John Wall comprise the best backcourt in the league \u2014 no matter what the numbers say. But he\u2019s not going to change his approach, not now, with things falling into place nicely for the sixth-year guard who has been the Wizards\u2019 best and most consistent player this season with Wall missing 11 games due to injury. \u201cI think there is space, an opening for all of that,\u201d said Beal, who ranks No. 10 in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. \u201cThat\u2019s always a goal of mine, being an All-Star, but I never go out there playing strictly for that. First and foremost, I go out there for my team and to get wins and do whatever it takes to get that job done. \u201cI don\u2019t consume myself with trying to be an All-Star and trying to prove to people that I\u2019m capable of being one. If I am one, I am one, and that\u2019s great. But people who are more than deserving get snubbed every year. So there\u2019s really nothing you can do about it. And I don\u2019t allow it to affect my game or affect me mentally. I just go out and control what I can control.\u201d Beal is doing a fine job of controlling his game this season. He leads the Wizards in scoring and is averaging career highs in points per game (23.4), rebounds (4.4), assists (3.6) and steals (1.2). He\u2019s been a steady force for a team that\u2019s shown a penchant for playing up (11-6 against teams currently at .500 or above) and down (11-10) to its competition this season. They\u2019re moving in the right direction, though, recently. They\u2019ve won three straight games and seven of their last 10 to get themselves back into the home court mix in the Eastern Conference playoff chase. Beal has at his best during this 10-game stretch, averaging 22.6 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.3 steals while doing his usual (underrated) job on the defensive end. He\u2019s averaged 29 points on a 60 percent shooting (52 percent from 3-point range), with 16 assists and just three turnovers during the three-game win streak. And as good as he\u2019s been on most nights, his timing has been impeccable during the season\u2019s rough patches. A night after a 47-point loss at Utah Dec. 4, when he scored just 11 points, Beal bounced back with a career-high 51-points at Portland . He and Wall called out the entire locker room for playing \u201cselfish\u201d against inferior teams after a deflating Dec. 27 loss in Atlanta and Beal rebounded in the three games since with 21 points in a win over Houston, a near triple-double ( 39 points, nine rebounds and nine assists ) in Sunday\u2019s win over Chicago and 27 points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals in Wednesday\u2019s blowout win over the Knicks . But the numbers, Wizards coach Scott Brooks insists, don\u2019t do Beal\u2019s season the justice it deserves. Beal\u2019s groundhog day approach \u2014 Brooks lauded his star shooting guard\u2019s low-key grind, tireless work ethic and Groundhog Day consistency \u2014 has allowed him to elevate his game this season. \u201cHe\u2019s developed so much just in the year and a half I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWhen I first got here, he barely said a word, not even to me. He\u2019s opened up a lot. He\u2019s more vocal and more of a leader. He\u2019s more demanding, especially of himself, and he\u2019s a two-way player. We all know he can score the ball. He\u2019s sneaky athletic, and I still think he has another level or two he can go to, which is a good thing. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing for all good players, going from good to great is a challenge. But you can see it happening from last year on, he\u2019s becoming one of the great ones in our league because he does it at both ends of the floor.\u201d Wall understands better than most what it means for Beal to continue to take the strides needed for the Wizards to finally break through in the postseason. Atlanta, Toronto and Boston have all been to the conference finals against Cleveland in the years since Wall and Beal proclaimed themselves and the Wizards as team next. Last season\u2019s Game 7 loss to the Celtics in the conference semifinals still stings, because the Wizards truly felt like it was \u2018their time.\u201d \u201cThe opportunity is still right there for us,\u201d Wall said. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d Well, save for that chip Beal would never admit to carrying around on his shoulder after not being named an All-Star last season. Wall believes that \u201csnub\u201d gave Beal the extra motivation needed to go back to the lab in the offseason and continue honing his craft. \u201cI told him, when you rebound the ball and become more of a playmaker, that boosts your game up to another level and people realize they can\u2019t double team either one of us as much because they know we can both make plays,\u201d Wall said. \u201cSo he added everything to his game. And I\u2019m out there trying to knock down shots for him whenever he\u2019s driving and they are double-teaming him. It\u2019s expanding both of our games. He\u2019s always been a scorer for us but him making plays off the dribble has been a lot better this year and we\u2019re better because of it.\u201d The Wizards are going to need both of their backcourt stars, and then some, to fulfill the promise this season. The Celtics and Raptors own the top two spots in the Eastern Conference standings in the opening days of 2018 with LeBron James and the Cavaliers sitting in the third spot ahead of the Wizards. The Celtics and Cavaliers have both had double-digit win streaks this season and the Raptors had a stretch between Thanksgiving and Christmas that saw them win 12 of 13, meanwhile the Wizards have just had to concentrate on catching up and trying to keep up the pace. Beal knows what the Wizards are dealing with, how steep the climb will be. It\u2019s all in front of him now, in plain view. \u201cThe game is slowing down for me more and more this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe floor is opening up and I\u2019m making better reads, I\u2019m being smarter, knowing how teams are going to play me. And I\u2019m staying more poised, more than anything, more confident. \u201cAnd I\u2019m most definitely a two-way guy. I take pride in my defense, in keeping my matchup from getting their average every night. It\u2019s my motto really, knowing I\u2019m going to have a tough matchup every single night. And it\u2019s a mental challenge more than anything, knowing that I have to bring it every night at the highest level.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 12 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  Tied for No. 2 Season stats:  25.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists Durant sat out of Thursday\u2019s game against Houston \u2014 a showdown of the top two teams in the Western Conference \u2014 with a right calf strain. It was a cautionary move from the Warriors, who have no reason to take any unnecessary risks with their stars given the way the others pick up the slack when one or more of them are not in uniform. Durant\u2019s most recent work (26.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2.6 blocks in the 10 games prior) had him trending towards the No. 1 spot anyway on a Warriors team that has won nine straight road games. Durant is just 25 points shy of 20,000 for his career. If he just reaches his average against the Clippers Saturday in Los Angeles ( 3:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), he\u2019ll become the 44th player in league history (and the eighth active player, joining Dirk Nowitzki, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dwyane Wade, Pau Gasol and Joe Johnson) to reach that milestone. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  32.3 points, 9.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds Harden was also a casualty in that Thursday night TNT showdown against the Warriors and could miss as many six weeks, per the Houston Chronicle , with that Grade 2 left hamstring strain. That would be absolutely devastating news for the Rockets if they didn\u2019t have Chris Paul, Eric Gordon and Gerald Green, among others, around to keep the Rockets in that chase for the No. 1 spot in the West. Whatever time Harden misses might end up being exactly what his body needs, given the load he had to tote through his first 35 games of this season. The Rockets needed him healthy and dialed in down the stretch of the season and into the postseason more than they need to hustle to get him back on the floor anytime soon. Paul will handle things just fine until Harden is ready to return. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  24.4 points, 4.9 assists, 3.3 rebounds Irving couldn\u2019t buy a bucket with his former Cavaliers teammates in town for Wednesday\u2019s battle between the Eastern Conference heavyweights. He shot just 5-for-14, missing all five of his 3-point attempts en route to a season-low 11-point night. And yet, he was in the middle of everything as his Celtics teammates picked him up at every turn to help him get his first win against his old crew. Kyrie did grab a season-high nine rebounds to go with his six assists. But it should be clear by now that these Celtics are thrive on more than just his offensive wizardry. The Celtics are a scrappy bunch with toughness that has been on display since Gordon Hayward went down five minutes into the season opener. They\u2019ll need to lean on that grit with an upcoming back-to-back set tonight against Minnesota ( 7 ET, ESPN ) and in Brooklyn Saturday night ( 6 ET, NBA League Pass ). Then and only then will Kyrie and the Celtics get a real breather, not having to suit up again until their Jan. 11 game against Philadelphia in London . Last week\u2019s ranking:  Tied for No. 2 Season stats:  27.5 points, 9.1 assists, 8.1 rebounds James is still trying to dig out from under the coal shower he got for Christmas and his 33rd birthday five days later. The Cavaliers have won just once, Tuesday\u2019s 127-110 thumping of Portland , since a Dec. 21 win over Chicago. Two of their four losses during that five-game stretch have come to their two biggest rivals \u2014 Christmas Day vs. the Golden State Warriors and Wednesday\u2019s loss in Boston to Kyrie Irving and the Celtics. The energy that was evident the night before, when Isaiah Thomas scored 17 points in 19 minutes during his Cavaliers debut , was sorely lacking in Boston. That sets the stage for a big Saturday night in Orlando ( 7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass ), where Thomas is slated to make his first start and James can get to work on the chemistry they need to develop for the remainder of his season. LeBron is always at his best when challenged, and with the Cavaliers sitting third in the Eastern Conference standings behind Boston and Toronto, there is work to do. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 8 Season stats:  27.0 points, 6.5 assists, 5.0 rebounds Curry has been an absolute menace to NBA society since coming back from that 10-game absence because of the sprained ankle. Sure, it\u2019s just three games, but 33.0 points on an absolutely wild 60.7 percent shooting from the floor (and 55.6 percent from 3-point range) to go along with his six rebounds and 5.3 assists per game is downright preposterous, even for the two-time Kia MVP. Whatever rehabilitation routine he followed needs to be packaged and sold. Because somehow Curry has returned to action playing at a higher level than he was operating at when he went down late in a Dec. 4 win in New Orleans after back-to-back 30-point games. It\u2019s a great sign for the Warriors, who enter the month before before the February trade deadline looking like a team that\u2019s finding its stride with the roster getting back healthy. As well as they played without him (8-2 with Kevin Durant dominating), the Warriors clearly got to another level with Curry.   The next five: 6. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 8. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 9. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans 10. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs And five more \u2026: Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola jokic, Denver Nuggets; Chris Paul, Houston Rockets An inside look at Klay Thompson from a Western Conference scout: \u201cOn a team with as much quality talent as the Warriors have, with two of the best guys on the planet as your biggest stars, it\u2019s easy to forget how prefect a fit Klay is on that team. He\u2019s got an absolutely beautiful stroke, and you always start there with his game. But he\u2019s so much more than just a great shooter. The work he does without the ball, on both ends of the floor, is literally textbook. If you\u2019re watching film and trying to teach guys, not just young guys but veterans in this league, how to stay alive on every possession, I\u2019d get some cut ups of what he does and run them over and over again. He makes weak side plays all the time, just moving and being in the right place at the right time. Figuring out the right position to be in on a given play is a skill that most guys go through their entire career without really understanding, let alone mastering such a subtle part of the game. But I guarantee you his coaches love it. We see it all the time watching these guys. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a guy who can get 30 any night without dominating the ball at all, and on that same night he gets 30 he\u2019s guarding two or three positions on the other end of the floor at an elite level. I\u2019m not here to soap box about him being underappreciated or overlooked, because I think anyone with a brain who knows basketball understands exactly how valuable a player like this can be on any team. It\u2019s just easy to miss how good, no great an all around basketball player he is if you only focus on his shooting, which he does as well as anyone. He\u2019s mastered his role on this team and he\u2019s such a critical piece to their puzzle. If he\u2019s got an ego, you cannot tell watching them, because he\u2019s adjusted in whatever ways Steve [Kerr] has needed him to with the development of Draymond Green, the addition of Kevin Durant and everything else that\u2019s changed over the years. Again, no one has to tell the Warriors to appreciate the guy because they know exactly what they\u2019ve got in Klay.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The captains will be the All-Star starter from each conference who receives the most fan votes in his conference. TNT will reveal the All-Star Game starters, including the two captains, on Thursday, Jan. 18 during TNT NBA Tip-Off presented by Autotrader at 6 p.m. ET, featuring Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kenny Smith.

The team rosters will be revealed on Thursday, Jan. 25 during a special one-hour edition of TNT NBA Tip-Off at 7 p.m. ET. For the second consecutive year, NBA players and basketball media will join fans in selecting the All-Star Game starters. Fans will account for 50 percent of the vote, while all current players and a media panel will account for 25 percent each. Players and select media will be able to complete one full ballot, featuring three frontcourt players and two guards each from both the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. After all votes are tallied, players will be ranked in each conference by position (guard and frontcourt) within each of the three voting groups \u2013 fan votes, player votes and media votes. Each player\u2019s score will be calculated by averaging his weighted rank from the fan votes, the player votes and the media votes. The five players (two guards and three frontcourt players) with the best score in each conference will be named NBA All-Star Game starters.

James ranked first in the Eastern Conference in assists (10.3 apg), third in scoring (27.5 ppg) and eighth in rebounding (8.2 rpg) as the Cavaliers went 9-5 in December. He also tied for second in the East in steals with 1.93 per game. The four-time Kia NBA MVP finished second in the East with nine double-doubles and recorded a conference-best five triple-doubles, including three straight from Dec. 14-17 to tie his career-long streak set in March 2009. He notched at least 20 points in 13 of 14 games and recorded five games with 30 or more points. The 33-year-old forward tallied at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists 11 times. Westbrook averaged a triple-double of 27.8 points (fourth in the NBA), 10.6 assists (tops in the NBA) and 10.2 rebounds (fourth in the West) as the Thunder went 12-5 for the month, including wins over the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets and Toronto Raptors. The 29-year-old guard posted six triple-doubles to improve his league-leading total to 12. He shot 50.0 percent or better from the field in seven of his last nine games for the month. On Dec. 22, Westbrook\u2019s game-winning three-pointer capped a 30-point, 15-assist performance in a 120-117 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.

One is owned by the man who was feted at this political fundraiser, Donald J. Trump. The presidential campaign was in full blast and saltier than the crackers on the cheese plate being passed around. Fresh off the plane, Trump thanked the Republicans for the big \u2018ole Texas welcome, witnesses say, before launching a blistering attack on the usual targets: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, illegal immigration. Then, near the end of his 30-minute lunchtime appearance, in an effort to connect with the locals, he pivoted and mentioned perhaps the most famous man in town: Gregg Popovich. Witnesses say Trump called Popovich \u201ca great coach\u201d and said \u201che does a good job\u201d and then there was some fidgeting in the room when the soon-to-be polarizing leader of the free world said this: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the coach is on my side.\u201d Confirmation came emphatically, right after Trump won a divisive election that November. The coach of the Spurs lit into the President over the next several months with a handful of rants that had the stealth of Kawhi Leonard ambushing a timid ball-handler. In no particular order, here were Pop\u2019s Greatest Hits, all issued through the media and without prompting or provocation: \u201cThe disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments \u2026 have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. I live in a country where half the people ignored that to elect someone.\u201d And : \u201cHe is in charge of our country. That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d And : \u201cThe man in the Oval Office is a soulless coward who thinks he can only become large by belittling others.\u201d And : \u201cWe have a pathological liar in the White House \u2026 You can\u2019t believe anything that comes out of his mouth.\u201d Popovich didn\u2019t stop there with a President whose sensitivity and intelligence he questioned and accused of being guilty of \u201cgratuitous fear-mongering.\u201d When he took Trump to task for criticizing NFL players who knelt during the National Anthem and defended their rights to do so, Popovich also suspected a measure of the public outrage was racially motivated. \u201cOur country is an embarrassment to the world,\u201d he said. A 68-year-old wealthy white man, therefore, became a sports voice with weight in the political and social justice arena, where the NBA league office has greenlighted players and coaches to speak up. Popovich has done so with clarity and insight to gain national applause in certain corners. He wasn\u2019t the first or the last in sports to verbally spank the president or tackle right-leaning sensitivities, yet he\u2019s certainly the most unique in one respect. As a graduate of the Air Force Academy who works in a military town, and a five-time NBA champion coach who might symbolize the city more than The Alamo, Popovich has long been elevated to icon status, perhaps permanently so, in San Antonio, where folks are mad about the Spurs. Still, this is mostly conservative Texas, one of the most Republican of states based on the state legislature and the congressional delegation, a state that voted Republican in 10 straight presidential elections and saw 52.6 percent of voters punch for Trump . While voters in San Antonio-proper lean liberal, the surrounding areas swing solidly the opposite. Julianna Holt, the Spurs CEO and Popovich\u2019s boss since March after assuming the position held for 20 years by her husband Peter , supported various Republican presidential candidates before eventually donating $5,400 to Trump\u2019s campaign and $250,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, according to Federal Election Commission records. Popovich is therefore a blue blood in a red state and the contrast makes for strange if not uncomfortable alliance between a beloved coach and a group of conflicted Spurs worshippers. His views have in fact shattered the sacrilege by generating hostility from a segment of the basketball flock, something no coach with his credentials would ever feel. The constant winning and acts of charity do not insulate him from those who would prefer Popovich stuff a sweat sock in his bullhorn. \u201c While we all believe Gregg Popovich has the right to his opinions, where was Popovich when Hillary called half of us a \u2018basket of deplorables? \u2019  Many were Spurs fans who are now tired of being insulted \u2026 many of us will never pay to see a Spurs game again.\u201d \u2014 Donna Howington \u201c The money I will save this year not attending Spurs games should buy me a nice set of golf clubs. T hanks Pop!\u201d \u2014 J ake Ingorgia \u201c I will never watch them again until Popovich is gone. He is just like all the other leftist celebrities.\u201d \u2014 L ee Harbach, Bulverde They arrive on cue, most from the dusty towns that orbit around San Antonio, some from the city itself. Popovich has unloaded three times this year on Trump, once after the election, once at the start of training camp and most recently by cold-calling Dave Zirin, a friend and liberal writer from The Nation , a progressive magazine. And each time, the letters land in the office of Ricardo Pimentel, the editor who coordinates the comments section of the Express-News , San Antonio\u2019s newspaper of record. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle,\u201d says Pimental, with a sigh. \u201cHe speaks out. People who disagree with him send us letters to the editor, then people who object to their disagreement write us letters to the editor defending Pop. Then they respond to one another.\u201d The initial reaction, he said, is always stacked against Popovich and many identify themselves as Spurs fans ripping up their tickets or promising to never attend or watch games again. Even if those who made threats actually carried them out, the change in the Spurs\u2019 home attendance is a blip, from 99.2 percent capacity last season to 98.6 so far this season. Popovich, of course, has been big for business since his first full season as coach in 1997-98. Besides the titles, the Spurs have reached the playoffs every season and won 50 games every season (except for the lockout-shortened 50-game 1998-99 campaign, when they won 37). In short, Popovich\u2019s Spurs have a track record beyond reproach in the NBA. If the 2017-18 Spurs stay on pace, it\u2019ll be 20 straight winning seasons for Popovich, one more than Phil Jackson for the all-time NBA record. He hasn\u2019t been this politically vocal until lately, due to Trump, yet was always politically aware, say those who know him. Well-versed through his readings and observations, Popovich welcomes discussion with acquaintences about classism, leadership, government and preferably over a bottle of wine. His two-decades exposure to young black men from humble beginnings raised his awareness and sensitivities about race and bias. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr once played for the Spurs and lately has echoed many of the same thoughts as Popovich. But Kerr coaches in the Bay Area, where folks nod their heads in agreement. Kerr said he can only imagine the flak Popovich catches in Texas. \u201cHere\u2019s this iconic coach who stands for everything that\u2019s right and for honor and integrity, he served in the military, you see him stand at attention for the American flag \u2014 man, Pop loves his country,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd in the middle of Texas for him to be questioning the Republican President, some of the people down there are probably confused. Like, \u2018I don\u2019t get it, we love this guy but he\u2019s on the other side from us.\u2019 \u201cWhat I love about Pop is that it\u2019s not about party, not about politics. It\u2019s about integrity and character and that\u2019s what people need to pay attention to. It\u2019s not about some policy, not about how much we pay in taxes. If we can just get back to the point where character matters, then we\u2019ll be in better shape. The problem is, it\u2019s clear character has gone down the tubes in many leadership positions in our country. That\u2019s what Pop is calling out.\u201d True enough, Popovich never publicly attached himself to a political party; to suggest he is against Republicans might be as misleading as believing Colin Kaepernick is against the military. When he played for Popovich, Kerr couldn\u2019t recall a time when the coach was this annoyed by the country\u2019s leadership. \u201cThe country was in a better place in terms of a relatively peaceful time back then,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYes, 9-11 happened and the whole world changed. But we didn\u2019t have quite the same partisan nature, not only in politics but the national conversation. And so people could just admire Pop for who he was and people might not have been aware of his political leanings because they didn\u2019t ask. When we won and went to the White House, Pop and the team went when Bush was in office. We went in \u201999 when President Clinton was there. Republican, Democrat, didn\u2019t matter. The times are so different now.\u201d Kerr laughed quickly when asked about the semi-serious groundswell of social media support for a Kerr-Popovich ticket in 2020 . Kerr said he hopes to be on his fifth NBA title as a coach then, but turned semi-serious about Popovich. \u201cOur country needs somebody like Pop who can actually lead and unite from a position of authority and credibility,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThis guy served in the military, grew up in a melting pot, understands leadership. More than anything, he\u2019ll cut through all the [expletive].\u201d Since going nuclear on Trump, Popovich declined invites from the national political shows (and wouldn\u2019t comment for this story). That proves what friends have maintained all along: Popovich doesn\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s political hero or pundit. He\u2019d rather speak when the moment calls for it, then be left alone. That last part is tricky, though. \u201c Can you imagine being Republican on the Spurs? Would you feel welcome? He \u2019 s like Berkeley \u2014  for free speech unless you disagree with him. Shut up and coach, Gregg.\u201d \u2014 Shannon Deason \u201c When it comes to coaching basketball or drinking wine, Popovich has experience. When it comes to our country, his opinion is no better than anyone else \u2019 s.\u201d \u2014 Harold Siemens, S eguin \u201c Open letter to the NBA referee who ejected Pop from the Warriors-Spurs game: Don \u2019 t feel bad about what Gregg Popovich called you. He called the POTUS worse and got away with it. \u201d \u2014 Larry Peabody Once the wheels touched down, the pilot jokingly announced over the loudspeaker: \u201cWelcome to Gregg Popovich International Airport,\u201d and one particular passenger noticed that nobody on the plane thought it was strange. Sean Elliott always knew how deeply rooted Popovich is with San Antonio. Aside from the famous Spanish missions and the River Walk, the city is known for the only professional sports team in town. And while George Gervin, David Robinson and Tim Duncan have come and gone, the one lingering reminder is a sometimes gruff and scruffy coach, maybe the NBA\u2019s best ever. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the pillars of the community,\u201d said Elliott, twice an All-Star with the Spurs. \u201cHe\u2019s looked at with great admiration. He is as respected as anyone who has ever lived in or been part of the city. It\u2019s not just because he\u2019s a basketball coach. Pop has been a big part of the community, huge contributor to charitable functions, good leader.\u201d Elliott was a Spurs rookie in 1989 when their relationship began and he saw the start of Popovich\u2019s reach in the region. Popovich then was an assistant coach under Larry Brown and just planting his feet in the NBA. That summer, Elliott and Popovich piled into a van with the team\u2019s \u201cCoyote\u201d mascot and conducted basketball clinics in San Marcos, Corpus Christi, Laredo and similar places. They were signing autographs in malls and running kids through drills in 100 degree heat, never hearing a complaint from the coach. Elliott said folks in those small conservative towns loved him. \u201cIf you sit and hear him talk about something, you tend to agree with him,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cHe\u2019ll put it in a logical way and he\u2019s very thoughtful, well read and super intelligent, maybe the most intelligent person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d The owner of the Spurs then was Red McCombs, a homespun Texan who made his fortune in car dealerships and media companies. McCombs didn\u2019t give Popovich the coaching job after firing Brown, telling Popovich \u201cyou\u2019ve got a chance to be a great coach\u201d if he got more experience, which he did, going to the Warriors to work for Don Nelson. Popovich returned to San Antonio two years later as general manager, then became coach and the rest is history. Now 90, McCombs said: \u201cPopovich has become the distinguished part of the franchise. He wears it well. Can\u2019t say enough about what kind of man he is and what he\u2019s meant to San Antonio. God has blessed us with Gregg Popovich.\u201d McCombs loves to tell how Popovich, by chance, learned that a local family needed a car. The coach wrote a check, gave it to the father and walked away. McCombs said it was \u201ctypical Popovich\u201d who has empathy for those with less. McCombs, curiously, has traditionally been one of the biggest Republican bankrollers in the state, who gave to the Trump campaign and is fully aware of what Popovich thinks of his choice for President. And so one of the most powerful men in Central Texas, who leans politically to the color of his nickname, had a strong reaction to that. \u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to give his comments about citizenship or Trump or anything else,\u201d said McCombs, voice rising. \u201cYes, he made some statements that others might disagree with. But I\u2019ll tell you this: Popovich would be elected to anything he wants to in San Antonio.\u201d \u201c Our country is not an embarrassment to the world. I will tell you what an embarrassment is. It is an American citizen who got a free education from the great Air Force Academy \u2026 and then has the audacity to say that the greatest nation in the world is an embarrassment because the President rightly demands that Americans stand for the anthem. Popovich should be ashamed of himself. \u201d \u2014 Nick DeLouis, Fair Oaks Ranch \u201c Nowhere on God \u2019 s green Earth do they have the right to disrespect our flag and the men and women who died to keep us free. I \u2019 m appalled that you stooped so low to join in that disrespect. Shame on you! \u201d \u2014 Fred Martin, Fair Oaks Ranch \u201c Coach Pop has squashed my love and enthusiasm for the team. A national treasure, he is not. Coach Pop has a voice, but not my voice.\u201d \u2014 J o Ivan A few years ago Popovich was in New York with his daughter to catch a Broadway play when the coach had a last minute change in strategy. He learned that John Carlos was giving a lecture at New York University that night. So Popovich told his daughter to take one of her friends instead; said he was going to see \u201cDr. Carlos\u201d speak. \u201cWhen he came in I was surprised and delighted,\u201d Carlos said recently. \u201cQuite naturally, everyone knew who he was but he just wanted to sit and listen.\u201d A year later, in 2015, Popovich flew Carlos to San Antonio to address the team and Carlos admitted to being star struck around Tim Duncan and others. Yet Carlos was most curious about Popovich and why the coach took a strong interest in an Olympic sprinter who raised a fist on the victory stand in 1968 , which is frozen as an iconic civil rights moment. \u201cBeing with the Spurs gave me an opportunity to check his character out,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cI knew he was a whiz at putting players together to bring out their best ability. But through my conversations with him it became apparent that he was a social activist himself at one point in his life. He was teaching his players about activism and to be concerned about their fellow man and what was going on around their lives, not just basketball. \u201cI was impressed. He just wanted them to know they had a larger role than just playing basketball in the society in which they live.\u201d Carlos, therefore, was not surprised to see Popovich defend the rights of kneeling black football players who came under attack from Trump. On the first day of training camp in September , Popovich said: \u201cObviously race is the elephant in the room and we all understand that. Unless it is talked about constantly it is not going to get better.\u201d What followed was another swirl of exchanges between Popovich critics and supporters in San Antonio, and Popovich acknowledged receiving mail from both sides. The anti-Pop mail, though, was jarring to Carlos, given the coach\u2019s work in town. \u201cWhen people write and lambast him for taking leaders to task for what they\u2019re doing to society, that\u2019s like water rolling off a duck\u2019s back, man,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cWhen they write negative things about him, it encourages him to keep doing what he\u2019s doing. Those people are the problem. Go ahead and throw stones and it just motivates him to do his job. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a black man who spoke out. Imagine what they think of him as a white man who speaks just as strong, to try and get people to see things in a better light? They throw stones at him even more, like, \u2018Hey you\u2019re white, you have a great life. Keep your mouth shut.\u2019 Well, God points people in certain directions. We know who we are. We do what we do.\u201d And what Popovich does is enlist the help of giants in the social justice world and bring them into his world. He did that with Cornel West, the Harvard professor and civil rights activist, last fall. Popovich invited West to San Antonio to speak at an East Side community center with a few hundred mostly black and Latino students and their parents. Done without TV cameras or media invitation, the discussion was about the importance of education, the imperfect world, self respect and how to help communities. This was an audience that, presumably and unanimously, connected with a white man who didn\u2019t live among them, but was with them. They were the people Popovich had in mind when he attacked present leadership. This was not the audience that writes to the Spurs and the Express-News asking him to take a vow of silence, though he is aware of them, too. \u201cSome responses make you wonder what country you live in,\u201d Popovich said, \u201cand other responses make you very hopeful \u2026 overall, it renews my feeling that something must be done because there is enough people willing to listen.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The Rockets are 16-2 in games that both Harden and Paul have played , but Paul has missed 17 games with knee and groin injuries. And now, Harden is out for at least two weeks with a strained hamstring. But the Rockets still have the league\u2019s third best record and are only a game in the loss column behind the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference. Their offense has remained potent, and they\u2019ve been improved defensively. Through Wednesday, they\u2019re one of four teams \u2013 the Warriors, Raptors and Wizards are the others \u2013 that rank in the top 10 on both ends of the floor . That has generally been the formula for contending for a title, though a team in Cleveland has defied the rules a couple of times over the last few years. The playoffs are still 3 1\/2 months away, but the Rockets and Warriors will meet for the second time this season Thursday at 8 ET, the first game of TNT\u2019s double-header. Here are some numbers to know about the Rockets going into that game\u2026 Pace : 101.5 (8th) OffRtg : 112.9 (2nd) DefRtg : 104.5 (10th) NetRtg : +8.5 (2nd) Team:  Per game stats | Advanced splits | Lineups | Game log Players:  Per game stats | On-off court | Player shooting History:  Season by season results | Advanced stats | Franchise leaders The Rockets have scored 58.1 points per game in the restricted area or at the free-throw line, a rate which ranks second in the league. THE CONTEXT  When we think about the Rockets\u2019 offense, we think about the 3-pointers first. They have taken 51 percent of their shots from 3-point range and are on pace to set the record for 3-point attempts for the third time in the last four seasons. But the most efficient ways to score are at the free-throw line (1.5 points per two-shot trip, league wide) and in the restricted area (1.3 points per attempt). Even corner threes (shot at 40 percent league-wide, 1.2 points per attempt) aren\u2019t worth as much as shots in the restricted area. The Rockets rank sixth in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area (34 percent) and second in free throw rate (31 attempts per 100 shots from the field). While the threes may be the more obvious story, the Rockets have scored 383 more points (10.6 per game) via shots in the restricted area and free throws than they have by shooting threes. While they shoot from beyond the arc at a historic rate, more of their offense comes from getting to the basket and getting to the line than from 3-pointers. The question now is how much the Rockets\u2019 ability to generate those points is hampered by the loss of Harden. Harden leads the league in both made (9.1) and attempted (10.5) free throws per game . He also ranks 18th (sixth among non-bigs) with 8.0 points scored in the restricted area per game . Put them together and only Giannis Antetokounmpo (22.4) and LeBron James (17.3) have averaged more points at the basket or at the line than Harden (17.2). But those aren\u2019t the only points that Harden generates at the basket or at the line. While also setting a record with 368 assists on 3-pointers, Harden set *a record with 483 assists on baskets in the restricted area last season. * Going back to 1996-97, when shot locations were first tracked. The previous high was Steve Nash\u2019s 479 in the 2007-08 season. This season, Harden\u2019s 168 assists in the restricted area rank second to Russell Westbrook\u2019s 181. When Harden has been on the floor, his teammates have shot 68 percent in the restricted area. With him off the floor, they\u2019ve shot 62 percent there. More than half (86) of Harden\u2019s restricted-area assists have been to Clint Capela, who can catch-and-finish lobs better than any other teammate. But Capela has averaged just 7.0 shots in the restricted area per 36 minutes with Harden off the floor, compared to 11.6 with Harden on the floor . The Rockets\u2019 numbers at the free throw line aren\u2019t just about Harden himself, either. Even when you take out Harden\u2019s own shots and free throws, his teammates\u2019 free throw rate has been higher when he\u2019s been on the floor (26 attempts per 100 shots from the field) than when he\u2019s been off the floor (24). The attention Harden draws on defense and his passing creates layups and trips to the line for his teammates. Chris Paul does the same, but not quite to the same degree. Harden (55 percent) and Paul (52 percent) rank second and fourth in effective field goal percentage on pull-up jumpers among 37 players who have attempted at least five per game this season . The threat they present off the dribble can help them get to the basket or find open teammates. But while 53 percent of Harden\u2019s assists have been on baskets in the restricted area, only 36 percent of Paul\u2019s have. The majority (57 percent) of Paul\u2019s assists have come on threes (the next best thing). And where Paul and Harden are so different is in their ability to get to the basket and get to the line. Harden has taken 31 percent of his shots in the restricted area . Paul: 13 percent . Harden has attempted 10.5 free throws per game and 50 per 100 shots from the field. Paul: 3.3 per game and 26 per 100 shots from the field. So, while Harden is out, we can expect the Rockets\u2019 shot chart to tilt more toward jump shots, both because of the shots their star guards take themselves and because of the ones they generate for teammates. Of course, Paul isn\u2019t trying to replace Harden, who should be back later this month. When they\u2019re both healthy, the Rockets will go back to always having at least one great playmaker on the floor. So far, in the 18 games that both have played, they\u2019ve been at their best with one of the two on the floor, because their offense has stayed efficient, while their defense has been better against opponents\u2019 reserves. On Wednesday, in their first game without Harden , the Rockets attempted just 34 3-pointers, the second fewest they\u2019ve shot in a game this season . The 33 shots they attempted between the restricted area and 3-point range were a season high (it was previously 24) and almost triple their average through their first 35 games (12.5). They scored just 49 combined points in the restricted area (32) or at the line (17). It was still a solid offensive game and a comfortable win over the Orlando Magic, but it did knock them down from first to second (a hair behind the Warriors) in offensive efficiency . Further slippage is on the way, and it\u2019s more about the points that Harden generates inside and at the line than those from beyond the arc. 1. The Rockets have been the league\u2019s best first quarter team , having outscored their opponents by 18.1 points per 100 possessions in the opening 12 minutes. Only the third-quarter Warriors ( plus-22.6 ) have been better than the first-quarter Rockets. But no team has been better offensively in any quarter than the Rockets have been in the first, when they\u2019ve scored 120.8 points per 100 possessions. Among 135 players who have attempted at least 75 shots in the first quarter, Ryan Anderson (66 percent) and Trevor Ariza (63 percent) rank second and 10th in first-quarter effective field goal percentage . Harden has shot about equally well in the first and second quarters (effective field goal percentage of 59 percent), but has seen his shooting dip in the second half, and especially in the fourth quarter . Aligning with the fact that, when Harden and Paul have played together, they\u2019ve been better with just one on the floor, the Rockets have been at their best in the last six minutes of the first quarter, outscoring their opponents by 24 points per 100 possessions (compared to plus-12 in the first six minutes of the first). The Rockets have held double-digit leads in the first quarter in 15 of their 36 games, winning 12 of those 15. Thanks to their strong starts, they\u2019ve held the lead in 63 percent of their total minutes this season, a mark that trails only the Warriors\u2019 64 percent. 2. The Rockets have been 11 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Luc Mbah a Moute on the floor (having allowed 97.3) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (108.3) . . That\u2019s the sixth biggest on-off-court DefRtg differential among 261 players who have played at least 500 minutes (for one team) this season. It helps Mbah a Moute\u2019s on-off numbers that he comes off the bench and defends against other team\u2019s reserves. But as a starter for the Clippers last season, he also had a strong on-off DefRtg differential ( the Clips allowed 7.0 fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the floor ). In fact, *in nine of his 10 seasons, Mbah a Moute\u2019s team has been better defensively with Mbah a Moute on the floor than with him off the floor. * The only exception: When he played 55 games (only 807 minutes) with the 2013-14 Timberwolves after a late-November trade from Sacramento The Rockets ranked sixth defensively through Dec. 13 , when Mbah a Moute injured his shoulder in a game against Charlotte. Since then, they\u2019ve ranked 25th defensively , having allowed more than 110 points per 100 possessions in 10 games without him. Injuries to Paul (who missed three of those games) and Capela (who missed five) were a factor. But the stretch hasn\u2019t been particularly harsh in regard to the offenses the Rockets have faced. Thursday\u2019s opponent will obviously be the toughest. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

They\u2019ve also had an annual funk the team falls into during that span, too, and it seems the latest edition is upon the Cavs. After last night\u2019s loss 102-88 loss to Boston Celtics , the Cavs are in a skid of sorts, having dropped five of their last seven games. Granted, this game was played without star guard Isaiah Thomas (who is not yet permitted to play in back-to-back games) and Cleveland was coming off a 127-110 home win vs. Portland a night earlier. Dave McMenamin of ESPN.com points out, though, that this loss \u2014 coupled with the Cavs\u2019 early-season run of 18 wins in 19 games getting further in the rear view mirror \u2014 has caught the attention of star forward LeBron James : In 2014-15, LeBron James\u2019 first season back with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team went into a funk, losing six straight (and 10 of 12) games as the calendar turned to 2015 . In that season, James took a two-week in-season break to recover from knee and back strains. The following season, Cleveland\u2019s rough patch happened in late February and early March as it lost four of eight games, capped off by a 106-103 loss to an undermanned Memphis Grizzlies team . Last season, the Cavs\u2019 worst slump likely came as the calendar turned to 2017. From Jan. 10-25, Cleveland lost six of eight games, the last loss coming at home in OT to the Sacramento Kings . After that game Jan. 25, 2017 game, James quickly dressed and answered a handful of questions before heading home. \u201dWe gotta get better. That\u2019s all,\u201d James said then. Flash ahead to this morning and the Cavs have some issues to address, McMenamin writes \u2014 the foremost being how to parse through a big man rotation that includes Channing Frye, Kevin Love and (the now healthy) Tristan Thompson. James acknowledged that the Cavs have to figure out their lineups while also integrating Thomas into the mix, which makes for a dicey situation. Per our John Schuhmann, the Cavs have the toughest schedule in the Eastern Conference in January (and the second-toughest in the league, behind only the Golden State Warriors). Cleveland\u2019s next four games are all on the road and feature the Orlando Magic ( Saturday ), the Minnesota Timberwolves ( Monday ), Toronto Raptors ( Thursday on TNT ) and Indiana Pacers ( Friday ) before a home date with the Warriors ( Jan. 15 on TNT ).

Thomas returned to TD Garden on Wednesday night for the first time since he was dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers in August as part of the blockbuster trade that brought Kyrie Irving to the Celtics. It was the lowest point of a whirlwind summer for Thomas, which was compounded by his ongoing recovery from the hip injury that cut short his postseason run with Boston last season. The injury sidelined him for Cleveland\u2019s season opener against his former team back in October. He missed the Cavs\u2019 first 36 games before returning to action against Portland on Tuesday night, scoring 17 points in 19 minutes . For now, his minutes are restricted and he isn\u2019t playing on back-to-back nights. So he returned to action Tuesday knowing that he\u2019d sit against the Celtics. \u201cI was out seven months. There\u2019s no way I was gonna come back against Boston and play 17 minutes,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s too big of an opportunity to just a play against my former teammates, my former coaches, the city that gave me my biggest opportunity.\u201d Thomas said he felt like he was home when he walked into the arena where he became a two-time All-Star, so much so that he almost went to the Celtics\u2019 locker room. \u201cI love this city. I love this organization. They gave me an opportunity to be who I always wanted to be,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough. So there\u2019s no hard feelings for anybody in this city or anybody in this organization. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m back. Like I always said, it\u2019s genuine love. And that\u2019s for the rest of my life.\u201d That respect is mutual, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cFirst and foremost, I will always value him as a friend and as a person,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cLost amongst all the talk of where people play and everything else is the fact that you did get to compete together. I always appreciated that about him.\u201d Though Thomas asked that there not be any kind of tribute video for him on this trip to the Garden, he did receive an extended standing ovation from the Boston fans when he was shown on the scoreboard monitors between the first and second quarters. He looked at the camera, pounded his heart three times and waved. There will be another opportunity for the Celtics honor him, when Boston hosts the Cavs on Feb. 11. But that\u2019s also the night Paul Pierce will have his jersey retired. Thomas said it\u2019s up to the Celtics whether they want to do something that night for him. \u201cThat\u2019s Pierce\u2019s night. The video tribute ain\u2019t the whole night. I just wanted my family to be here to see it,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it came down to. I wanted to be able to play. I wanted my family to experience the love and appreciation of this city and this organization are gonna give me on that night. \u201cI\u2019m not taking nothing from Paul Pierce. He played 15 years here. There\u2019s nothing I can take from here. If they choose to do it that night, that would be great. I would be honored.\u201d He said he\u2019s even buried the hatchet with Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge. Earlier this year, Sports Illustrated quoted Thomas wondering whether he\u2019d ever speak to Ainge again after the trade. But Thomas said Ainge reached out to him on Tuesday night. \u201cThere\u2019s no hard feelings. Only hard feeling is Danny didn\u2019t send me no Christmas card this year,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHe sent me one the last two years. He could have found my address somehow. Have I forgiven Danny?

From the first reports of Irving\u2019s desire to be traded in mid-July to him landing with the Boston Celtics (after the trade was reviewed and altered ) in late August , Irving\u2019s trade request sent shockwaves through the league all offseason. In short, few could understand how Irving could seek to be traded away from a team that went to three straight NBA Finals and boasted LeBron James. Irving, though, was reportedly on the trading block before that, writes Jackie MacMullen of ESPN.com . In her story published today, she reports that the Cavs sought to trade Irving in June, a fact Irving said is \u201cdistorted\u201d when talk of his trade request came to light: As for the specific timeline of when the Cavs shopped Irving, MacMullen reports it took place roughly around when the team parted ways with former GM David Griffin in mid-June and new GM Koby Altman was hired in late July . During that span, owner Dan Gilbert served as the primary decision-maker for the Cavs and, shortly before Griffin left, explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana involving Irving. Here\u2019s more from MacMullen: MacMullen reports that Irving and his agent, Jeff Wechsler, talked with Gilbert on July 9 and pressed Gilbert about the future of James.

I think last year\u2019s hunger for The Rubber-Match Finals made us accept without too much grumbling the relative breezes both Golden State and Cleveland had through the April and May portions of the postseason. But seeing some new blood, however unlikely, would be fine, maybe even welcome, this time around. That requires some fine team on either side \u2014 Toronto, Washington, Boston out East, Houston, San Antonio, Oklahoma City to the West \u2014 mustering a serious challenge. And, allowing for an injury or suspension or whatever, maybe pulling off something more notable than that. We can always find context and storylines for The Finals, if we get a bit of freshness dialed in. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019m eager to see the playoffs and if someone can come along and disrupt another Golden State Warriors-Cleveland Cavaliers matchup in June. Because nobody is creating much doubt as of yet. The team that\u2019s coming the closest is the Houston Rockets but they have three people who have underperformed in the playoffs: Mike D\u2019Antoni, Chris Paul and James Harden. There\u2019s always the San Antonio Spurs, yet they seem a star shy. And in the East, the Boston Celtics of 2019 stand a better chance and the rest \u2026 meh. Which means, I\u2019m most eager to see Warriors-Cavs in June. John Schuhmann :  I want to see what will happen with the Thunder, both on and off the floor. Can they continue to make progress offensively and if they do, will that encourage Sam Presti to keep the group together through the trade deadline? Or will the threat of Paul George leaving in free agency (and the long odds at beating the Warriors) force Presti to see what he can get for George by Feb. 8? Is it a guarantee that Carmelo Anthony will decline his early termination option this summer and stay under contract for another year? Do other stars want to play with Russell Westbrook?  Sekou Smith : As much fun as the trade deadline can be in a given year, I have to admit that the free agent summer has me daydreaming about the chaos that a couple of moves could cause. Of course, LeBron James could turn the basketball world upside down if he were to decide to take his talents elsewhere (I\u2019m not suggesting he should or I even think he will, I\u2019m only thinking about the seismic activity it would cause). What happens with Paul George is also another potential game-changer for several teams around the league. That said, it\u2019s the great unknown that most intrigues me about 2018. None of us saw the Kyrie Irving trade request coming or the Chris Paul-to-Houston move coming. Things like the Draft and trade deadline offer a season of speculation that usually centers on name players we know will be involved in the process. It\u2019s the moves we don\u2019t see coming, the things we cannot forecast, that produce the best drama."},{"id":42490,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-initial-thoughts-isaiah-thomas-debut-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2018-01-03","title":"Blogtable: First impressions of Isaiah Thomas with Cleveland Cavaliers?","content":"* * * Your quick, initial impression of Isaiah Thomas after watching him in a Cavs uniform for the first time ?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Guess I\u2019m one of those skeptics that Thomas has proven wrong again and again in his career, because I wasn\u2019t all that excited to see his impact on the Cavaliers. I know what they gave up in Kyrie Irving and my take has been, that\u2019s not replaceable. Well, no, it\u2019s not replaceable \u2014 not exactly. But Thomas showed enough, while lugging so much rust, as to open up new possibilities for Cleveland\u2019s attack. His pick-and-roll potential with LeBron James and Kevin Love is intriguing, and James will figure out how to tap every bit of potential from the headbanded one. Defensively \u2026 nah, we won\u2019t go there, since Irving\u2019s limitations there are notable as well. Shaun Powell :  Thomas looked rested, healthy, fresh and determined. He took his time during rehab and it showed: 19 minutes, 17 points. Even better for the Cavs, he showed he belonged. It\u2019s a small sample size, but this bodes well. Only question is whose minutes\/shots are getting trimmed and will that player be fine with it. John Schuhmann :  I took note of how aggressive he was. There was no taking it slow and just facilitating. He was using his quickness off the dribble to get to the basket or create an advantage to put the Portland Trail Blazers in rotation. There was some rust, but if he\u2019s already that confident in what his body can do, he\u2019s going to make the Cavs a better offensive team very soon.  Sekou Smith :  He is going to be every bit as dangerous as I initially thought he would be in joining the talented and veteran lineup Cleveland has assembled. There wasn\u2019t much rust that I could spot on his game after such a long layoff, which speaks to the diligence of his routine since the playoffs. He\u2019s a much better natural playmaker than he\u2019s given credit for and I think it showed during his 19 minutes against the Trail Blazers. You know he\u2019s going to score at a high rate. He\u2019s done that everywhere he\u2019s been when given the opportunity. The chip on his shoulder (from the trade, from his entire basketball career) is bigger than it has ever been \u2026 which is great for the rest of us. Thomas is determined to do whatever it takes to win at a championship level and put on a show while doing so. The matchup against the Golden State Warriors ( Jan. 15, 8 ET on TNT ) is going to be must-see-TV."},{"id":42484,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-where-will-lebron-james-finish-all-time-nba-stats-leaderboards","date":"2018-01-03","title":"Blogtable: Where will LeBron James rank on all-time stats leaderboards?","content":"* * * LeBron James turned 33 Saturday and continues to climb the NBA\u2019s all-time leaderboards . Realistically, where do you see James finishing in all-time points and assists?  * * * Steve Aschburner : No. 3 and No. 7. The keys to James\u2019 continued climb up the stats heaps will be his appearances and his minutes, which figure to flatten out or go down a bit as his totals go up. He is about 7,000 points behind No. 2 Karl Malone (36,928) and about 2,000 assists shy of No. 6 Oscar Robertson (9,887), with sizable gaps before Kobe Bryant and Isiah Thomas respectively at the No. 3 and No. 7 spots. So that\u2019s where I seem him landing before moving on to chase down NBA Franchise Owners in their various statistical categories. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019s a tricky question because nobody\u2019s sure how much longer LeBron intends to play (three more years at a high level is my guess because Father Time is undefeated). And we\u2019re not sure where he\u2019ll play after this season, which will also affect his role going forward. And yet: My guess is he\u2019ll finish higher on the scoring charts, naturally, maybe ahead of Kobe Bryant at No. 3 and in assists, either just above or just below Oscar Robertson, who sits at the No. 6 spot. That will juice the argument that LeBron is the best talent we\u2019ve ever seen, while Michael Jordan is the best all-around (player, winner). John Schuhmann : Given how well he\u2019s playing at the age of 33, it\u2019s hard to guess how many more years he\u2019ll play or if he\u2019ll ever miss more than just a few games to injury. But my best guess is No. 2 in scoring (in the 37,000 range) and No. 3 in assists (between 10 and 11,000). He has swapped out some of his mid-range shots for threes and is shooting those better, so he doesn\u2019t have to attack quite as much to stay in the 25-28 points-per-game range. Also, the Heat figured out how to best complement him (with shooting), the Cavs followed suit, and whatever team(s) he plays for going forward will know the same. So even if his scoring slows down, the assists will be there.  Sekou Smith : If he cared about such things, it would be fun to watch LeBron try to catch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for No. 1 on the scoring list. He\u2019d have to play at this level until LeBron Jr. made it to the league and he\u2019d also have to continue to hone that 3-point stroke. But realistically, he could catch and pass Kobe Bryant for No. 3 and scare Karl Malone at No. 2 , provided he avoids significant injury and finishes his career as the centerpiece of whatever team(s) he plays for. The top five of the all-time assists list is going to be tough , even for a passer\/facilitator as gifted as LeBron has always been. But just being the same stratosphere as Magic Johnson (No. 5), Oscar Robertson (No. 6), Isiah Thomas (No. 7) and Gary Payton (No. 8) puts LeBron in unbelievable company. His ability to master so many different facets of the game is what will set him apart from so many of the other all-time greats. LeBron\u2019s greatest accomplishment will be finishing in the top 10 on both lists and being the only man to do so."},{"id":42488,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid-doubtful-vs-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2018-01-03","title":"Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid (hand) out vs. San Antonio Spurs","content":" Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers got a win on New Year\u2019s Eve, toppling the Phoenix Suns 123-110 , but saw the big man go down with an injury that game.

A glance at the standings reveals that much has held to form, with Boston atop the East and Cleveland at No. 3 (3 1\/2 games behind the Toronto Raptors). How the teams got to this point has been a unique journey, with Boston starting off 0-2 \u2014 including a season-opening loss to Cleveland \u2014 before rattling off 16 straight wins. Cleveland started off 5-7 , but then went on a 13-game win streak to get back in the thick of the East chase. Tonight\u2019s showdown in Boston could say much about the state of the East and, perhaps, could serve as another springboard for either squad. To Celtics coach Brad Stevens, reflecting on that season-opening loss to Cleveland hasn\u2019t had much merit \u2014 in particular because it was the game in which Gordon Hayward suffered his season-ending injury . As both teams continue to grow in 2017-18, the Celtics know the Cavs remain a measuring stick for Boston, writes Mark Murphy of the Boston Herald : As for the Cavaliers, they are riding a high after seeing Isaiah Thomas\u2019 debut for them last night after months of hip injury rehab. Thomas will not play in tonight\u2019s game as he has not yet been cleared to play in back-to-back games. Cleveland acquired Thomas in a blockbuster offseason deal with the Celtics that sent Cavs All-Star Kyrie Irving to Boston. Irving had said earlier this week he expected Celtics fans to laud Thomas , the star of Boston\u2019s team the last few seasons and an All-Star himself. The cheers may be there for Thomas tonight, but won\u2019t be is a video tribute by the Celtics. Thomas cancelled that tribute himself, a move a Celtics spokesman told reporters about Tuesday. While the spokesman was not able to clarify why Thomas made that request, the Cavs guard clarified the move later in the day in responding to a tweet that accused him of egoism. \u201cGet over myself huh?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBecause I would like to actually PLAY & have my family in the arena to appreciate the LOVE the city\/organization will show US? It ain\u2019t about me it\u2019s about my family.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/isaiahthomas\/status\/948270571783147521 The Celtics are planning to honor Thomas at a later date, but the next Cavs-Celtics in Boston game falls on Feb. 11 \u2014 the date the team will retire Paul Pierce\u2019s No. 34 jersey .  Another player acquired in the Irving trade, forward Jae Crowder, is hoping he gets a warm reception from the Boston crowd as well. Known as a defensive stalwart for the Celtics during his 2 1\/2 seasons, Crowder felt \u2018disrespected\u2019 last season when fans cheered Hayward , who was then with the Utah Jazz and a known free-agent target of Boston. \u201cFans have cheered for opposing team\u2019s players before,\u201d he told the Boston Globe \u2018s Gary Washburn. \u201cI feel like they should do the same for me because I gave them a lot.

Thomas, sidelined with a hip injury since last season\u2019s Eastern Conference finals, will make his debut for the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers. After months of rehab, the All-Star point guard will take the floor for the first time with the Cavaliers, who acquired him last summer in the blockbuster trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Celtics. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process for me,\u201d Thomas said Monday following practice. \u201cIt\u2019s been a frustrating and tough process, but at the same time you got to trust it. I just attacked it every day to try to get better and now that day is here. I haven\u2019t played in so long, so man it\u2019s going to be a weird feeling tomorrow, but I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m happy it\u2019s here.\u201d Coach Tyronn Lue said Thomas will come off the bench and initially will play limited minutes. Also, he will not play in back-to-back games as he builds up strength, which means he won\u2019t face the Celtics on Wednesday night in Boston. \u201cOnce the minutes restriction is off, once the back-to-back thing is off and he\u2019s able to play a lot of minutes, then it\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Lue said. \u201cFor now, we\u2019re just happy to have him back and see who works well together, what happens and just go from there.\u201d Thomas was deeply hurt by Boston\u2019s decision to trade him, and he would like nothing more than to show his former team what it gave up. However, as much as Thomas would like to play against the Celtics, he knows the smarter move is to put his health first. \u201cIt won\u2019t be that tough,\u201d he said about sitting out the second meeting this season between the rivals. \u201cI know where I am right now and I wouldn\u2019t want to put myself out there to just try to force it. But I can wait until February. I think we play them in February again, so I can wait and put on a show then.\u201d The Cavaliers and Celtics will square off on Feb. 11. Thomas has slowly worked his way into game shape, scrimmaging first against the G League Canton Charge and then with his teammates a few days ago. While he\u2019s in good physical shape, his game still needs some conditioning. \u201cMy hip is better, but I have no rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no feel for the game right now. I\u2019ve been out for so long it feels like I lost my powers. So even when we\u2019re out there scrimmaging I can move around and do what I want, but I just don\u2019t have my powers yet. So, with the games coming, it\u2019s going to give me an opportunity to get my rhythm back, get my feel back. And it might take some time but at the same time, the progress that I\u2019ve made is all good and positive progress, and I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to be able to get out there and compete.\u201d The Cavaliers are eager to incorporate Thomas, who averaged nearly 29 points last season, into their offense. He gives the team another proven scorer who can take some of the pressure off LeBron James. There are bound to be some growing pains as the Cavs get comfortable with Thomas and vice versa. But Thomas isn\u2019t worried about not fitting in. \u201cI\u2019m a scoring guard so I know how to put the ball in the basket,\u201d he said. \u201cThey traded for me for a reason and that was to play the game that I know how to play and that\u2019s make plays, try to make the right play each and every time down and score the ball. And, I mean, those guys have welcomed me with open arms and they\u2019ve always said, even when we\u2019re scrimmaging today, like: `Stop passing, man. Be you and be aggressive and look to score.\u2019 So that always makes you feel comfortable that they want me to be who I am and that\u2019s all I can be.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":42521,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2017-18-week-12","date":"2018-01-01","title":"Week 12 Power Rankings: Golden State Warriors face league's toughest January schedule","content":"The Golden State Warriors got their Christmas win over the Cleveland Cavaliers and got Stephen Curry back five days later. Without Curry, they had the best defense in the league over an 11-game stretch . With him, they have the best offense we\u2019ve ever seen. So now, we might witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. And if the Warriors still have the league\u2019s best record and top-two rankings on both ends of the floor a month from now, we\u2019ll know that they\u2019ve hit their stride, because they have the league\u2019s toughest January schedule. The Warriors have both the fewest home games (five) and the most road games (nine) in the Western Conference this month. The also have the West\u2019s toughest schedule in regard to opponent strength, with their 14 January opponents having a cumulative winning percentage of 0.562 heading into the month. Nine of their 14 games are against teams that are currently at or above .500, and four of the other five are against teams \u2013 the Mavs, Clippers (x 2) and Bulls \u2013 that are currently playing better than their overall record. The Warriors\u2019 January schedule will test that second-ranked defense in particular, as nine of their 14 games are against teams that currently rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency , and only two are against teams \u2013 Dallas and Chicago \u2013 that rank in the bottom 10. Their month includes both of their games in Houston, as well as their only visits to Milwaukee, Toronto, Cleveland and Chicago. Interestingly, the Cavs will have the Eastern Conference\u2019s toughest January schedule. The Sixers have a slightly tougher slate in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage, but 12 of Cleveland\u2019s 14 January games are against teams that are currently at or above .500. And the Cavs will play three games, including their visit to Boston on Wednesday, with a rest disadvantage (where they\u2019re playing the second game of a back-to-back and their opponent is not). The stretch between Christmas and the All-Star break can be a slog for some teams. The Warriors and Cavs remain the favorites to return to The Finals in June and have the ability to flip the switch whenever they want, but it will be interesting to see how much resilience they show over the next 31 days. * * * Pace : Possessions per 48 minutes (League Rank) OffRtg : Points scored per 100 possessions (League Rank) DefRtg : Points allowed per 100 possessions (League Rank) NetRtg : Point differential per 100 possessions (League Rank) The league has averaged 99.3 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes and 105.4 points scored per 100 possessions this season. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings, released every Monday during the season, are just one man\u2019s opinion.

Movie-like storylines were norm in NBA last year","content":" Finally got to see \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d on Saturday. Regular movie attendance is a hazard of aging (you stay home more when you\u2019re married), of being a parent, of a job that often requires working weekends. I haven\u2019t seen any of the last six or seven movies that won Best Picture at the Oscars. So, seeing Luke Skywalker and the gang on the last weekend of 2017 was a rare treat, and a reminder of how quickly the past 12 months went by. Time is so ephemeral, and moments that seem so large at the time can quickly be swamped and forgotten with the advent of the next big thing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to stop and reflect on what\u2019s just happened, so we don\u2019t forget the lessons learned in the moment and don\u2019t repeat the mistakes we\u2019ve made. The NBA\u2019s big moments of 2017 stretched from coast to coast, inspiring and challenging both those who participated in them and those who witnessed them. They impacted the league\u2019s elite teams and its also-rans, and like the silver screen, created heroes and villains, winners and losers, as we got our figurative popcorn ready to watch the show. Here then are the top 10 NBA stories of 2017, introduced by some of my all-time favorite films: David Griffin, the very successful general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers, enters 2017 in the final year of his contract \u2014 and, understandably, would like to be paid commensurate with what the top GMs in the league get paid. The Cavaliers resist, and who knows why \u2014 the already huge outlay for salaries? The sense that anyone could successfully manage a team built around LeBron James? Nor do they give Griffin permission to interview with the Orlando Magic or Atlanta Hawks , each of whom seek it. By the end of June, after The Finals , Griffin is hard at work trying to put together potential deals to bring either Jimmy Butler or Paul George to Cleveland to play with James next season, and there is at least some traction on a three-team deal that would have sent Butler to the Cavs and Kevin Love to the Denver Nuggets. But all potential Griffin-driven deals are silenced June 19, when Griffin and the team announce that after a final discussion with owner Dan Gilbert about his future, they\u2019ll part ways at the end of the month . The decision throws one of the league\u2019s top two franchises into chaos, leaving it without the guy who brought Love from Minnesota , J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert from New York and Kyle Korver from Atlanta . Griffin also elevated Tyronn Lue from assistant coach to coach in 2016 , replacing David Blatt \u2014 who\u2019d led the Cavs to The Finals in 2015 . The move was roasted at the time; Lue and James and Griffin had the last word six months later, with the first championship parade for a major sports team in Cleveland since 1964 . The Cavs stayed in-house for their replacement, elevating assistant GM Koby Altman to the full-time GM gig. You thought Darth Vader and Luke had a complicated relationship? Jeanie Buss, the Lakers\u2019 controlling owner and president, goes hard in February to restructure the team\u2019s front office following years of questionable personnel decisions and coaching hires. She fires her brother, Jimmy, the former executive vice president and primary decision maker for on-court basketball decisions, as well as longtime General Manager Mitch Kupchak, replacing them, respectively, with Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and high-profile player agent Rob Pelinka . (The team also dismisses longtime PR head John Black.) The moves aligned with what the Buss family\u2019s patriarch and the team\u2019s longtime owner, the late Dr. Jerry Buss, clearly wanted after his death \u2014 for Jeanie to run the team after he was gone . The massive changes tie Jeanie and Magic, with whom she had grown close while he was the franchise\u2019s supernova player , as the team\u2019s chief decision makers going forward, as the Lakers try desperately to accelerate their rebuild in the post-Kobe Bryant era. Phil Jackson\u2019s unfulfilling stint as president of the Knicks comes to a sudden end after three years in June , just after Jackson takes French point guard Frank Ntilikina No. 8 overall in the 2017 Draft . Jackson\u2019s reign was not a total bust \u2014 he took Kristaps Porzingis fourth overall in the 2015 , to the consternation of the always-consternated fan base, but Jackson was proven right about the 7-foot Latvian\u2019s immense offensive potential. And New York did bring in decent role players during Jackson\u2019s term like Kyle O\u2019Quinn and Willy Hernangomez. Yet Jackson was never able to get his team to embrace the triangle offense he insisted could still work in the NBA, in part because he was no longer physically able to coach. He tried to instill it through a sort of osmosis, even though his coaches \u2014 including the last one he hired, Jeff Hornacek \u2014 clearly wanted to play a different style. Jackson was known to come down during practices to show players the finer points of the triangle \u2014 not the best look for the actual coach of the team at the time. And Jackson\u2019s once-strong relationship with Carmelo Anthony also frayed, as he began saying publicly that trading Anthony would be in the best interests of the franchise \u2014 which was true. But Jackson\u2019s odd tack of pointing out Anthony\u2019s shortcomings as an aging superstar did nothing to help his leverage in trade talks, or to get Anthony to waive the no-trade clause that Jackson had inexplicably given him when the Knicks re-signed Anthony to a five-year, $128 million deal in 2014 . Porzingis was so befuddled by how the team treated Anthony that he skipped his own exit interviews at the end of the regular season. The last straw for Jackson came when he said in an interview with the MSG Network, the team\u2019s house station, that he was willing to talk about trading Porzingis , who had displayed significant offensive potential in his first two seasons, to help the team\u2019s \u201cfuture.\u201d At that moment, Porzingis was 21 years old. The Knicks named longtime MSG executive Steve Mills as the team\u2019s new president; Mills hired veteran executive Scott Perry as his new GM. Gordon Hayward is beloved in Salt Lake City, the cornerstone of the Utah Jazz\u2019s painstaking rebuild after it traded Deron Williams to the Nets in 2011 and started over. Hayward, the team\u2019s first-round pick in 2010 , makes himself into a superstar during his seven seasons in Utah, which goes from 25 wins in 2013-14 to 38, 40 and 51 wins by 2016-17. That season, Hayward made his first All-Star team, averaging 21.9 points and 5.4 rebounds, shooting nearly 40 percent on 3-pointers. After the Jazz won a playoff series for the first time in seven years, Hayward entered unrestricted free agency in July, with several teams in hot pursuit \u2014 led by the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, with Utah trying to re-sign him as well. After taking his visits, Hayward is primed to make his decision via the Players\u2019 Tribune, the preferred method these days for athletes to get their views out, unfiltered. But ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes ruins the rollout by breaking the news : Hayward picked Boston, breaking the heart of Jazz nation and elating the Celtics, who had targeted him for months, if not longer. It made Hayward\u2019s gruesome season-ending injury just minutes into his Boston career even more devastating. That Les Alexander decided to sell the Houston Rockets after owning them for 24 years wasn\u2019t a surprise, even though Alexander had no health issues and certainly didn\u2019t need the money. Everyone, sooner or later, cashes in, and the 72-year-old Alexander was ready to walk away from the franchise that he helped lead to consecutive NBA titles  in the 1990s . What was surprising was the speed of the sale to local businessman, reality TV star and entrepreneur Tillman Fertitta. And what was shocking was the price tag: $2.2 billion, the biggest sale of an NBA team in history , topping the $2 billion Steve Ballmer paid for the LA Clippers in 2014 . While the sale price surely reflected the labor peace the NBA currently enjoys, the huge national TV deal in place through 2024, market size and quality of the franchise, it also reinforced the idea that the Ballmer deal wasn\u2019t an outlier, and NBA teams may well continue selling at or near those prices in the future. The NFL was crippled this season when players began emulating Colin Kaepernick and taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem to protest what they feel is police brutality around the country. That the protests were co-opted politically by opponents who conflated the player protests with being anti-military or somehow protesting the flag didn\u2019t matter; the damage was done.  NBA players didn\u2019t take such drastic steps, perhaps in part because the league has specific rules regarding standing for the anthem . But they didn\u2019t have to, because they\u2019d been so outspoken about so many deaths of African-Americans over the years that occurred under specious circumstances \u2014 Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and the like. Chief among the most outspoken players has been LeBron James, and he continued that on Sept. 23, when he went after President Trump, who\u2019d \u201cdisinvited\u201d the Golden State Warriors from the White House for the traditional championship team photo op (the Warriors had said they weren\u2019t going, anyway) and criticized Stephen Curry for \u201chesitating\u201d to accept the invite. James\u2019 retort soon went viral \u2014 and brought back the word \u201cbum\u201d to the American lexicon, if only for a while \u2014 and remains one of the most popular Tweets in history, with more than 1.5 million recorded \u201clikes\u201d as of this morning. The President did not respond to James\u2019 tweet, a marked departure from his usual pattern of almost immediately firing back on social media against anyone who criticizes him by name. And the players\u2019 stances are reinforced by several NBA coaches, who also go in on Trump early and often: Gregg Popovich , Steve Kerr and Stan Van Gundy chief among them. That there was very little public and\/or financial blowback for any of those teams because their respective coaches spoke out, and no public rebukes by their team\u2019s owners, either, spoke to the vast difference in just about everything between the NFL and NBA. Isaiah Thomas has a great individual season in leading the Boston Celtics to the Eastern Conference finals \u2014 he makes his second All-Star team, finishes third in the league in scoring (28.9 per game) , seventh in PER, fifth in three-pointers made, second in Offensive Win Shares \u2014 and leads the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring . And none of that matters when his world is shattered by the death of his younger sister, Chyna, in an automobile accident in Washington state just before the start of the playoffs. Playing through his grief, he twice scores 33 points in Boston\u2019s six-game victory over Chicago in the first round, flies across the country after the clinching win on a Friday, attends his sister\u2019s funeral in Washington state Saturday morning, then flies back across the country Saturday afternoon, not arriving back in Boston until 3 a.m. Sunday \u2014 with a 12:30 p.m. tipoff Sunday afternoon against Washington in the first game of the conference semis . Thomas again goes for 33 in a Game 1 win \u2014 getting a tooth knocked out in the process \u2014 and then puts on a performance for the ages three days later in Game 2 . Hurtling himself into the Wizards\u2019 defense in the second half, Thomas leads the Celtics back from a 14-point third-quarter deficit and a six-point deficit in the last three minutes of regulation, hitting shots from all over, again and again, in the fourth quarter and in overtime. In the last 17 minutes of play, Thomas scores 29 of his 53 points, driving the Celtics to an improbable Game 2 win \u2014 on what would have been his sister\u2019s 23rd birthday. It gave one chills, and pause , at what an athlete at the highest level of focus can achieve. The Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Russell Westbrook and the Rockets\u2019 James Harden battle all season long, superlative for superlative, highlight for highlight, in a quest for league Most Valuable Player honors. Harden becomes the first player ever to score 2,000 points and assist on 2,000 points in a season , and becomes the first player ever to score 2,000, grab 600 rebounds and dish out 900 assists in one season. The 4,554 points he personally accounted for in \u201916-\u201917 were the most ever by one man in one year. And, yet, Westbrook was just as incredible . He leads the league in scoring at 31.6 points per game, while adding 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists \u2014 equaling one of the great sports records that many thought couldn\u2019t be matched: Oscar Robertson\u2019s 1961-62 season, the last in which an NBA player averaged a triple-double . He does so with a team that, charitably, lacks consistent perimeter shooting, and is without another star player, Kevin Durant having left the summer before via free agency for the Golden State Warriors . In the end, Westbtrook wins Kia MVP honors , having had to accomplish something no one had done in more than 50 years to hold off Harden and his excellence. Kevin Durant joined the Warriors with one mandate: win the NBA championship. Nothing else would justify Durant\u2019s decision to leave the Thunder for the team that had just vanquished OKC in the 2016 Western Conference finals , in seven excruciating games \u2014 and even a ring wouldn\u2019t satisfy those who hated KD the most. There were some ups and downs during the regular season, as Durant found his way and Stephen Curry and the incumbent Warriors figured out how to recalibrate themselves around Durant. But Golden State got some traction late in the regular season after Durant returned from a knee injury , plowed through the Western Conference with ease in the playoffs and faced LeBron James and the Cavaliers for a third straight year in The Finals. Back on the biggest stage for the first time since 2011, Durant rises to the moment: a five-game average of 37.2 points , 8.2 rebounds and 5.4 assists, shooting 55.6 percent from the floor \u2014 including 47.4 percent on threes. The Warriors take the title back, and Durant takes home Finals MVP honors , having slayed all the dragons, beaten back all the haters and reaching the peak \u2014 on and off the court. There have been offseasons with significant deals before. There have been trades involving superstars before. But rarely has there been one offseason with so much of both. It began three days before the Draft, three days before the Draft, when Philly and Boston swap positions \u2014 the 76ers gave the Celtics a first-round pick either in 2018 or 2019 in order to move up from No. 3 in the 2017 Draft to No. 1, with the intent of taking University of Washington guard Markelle Fultz. The next night, Atlanta gets out from the remaining two years of Dwight Howard\u2019s contract by sending him to Charlotte , willing to take on the extra years of Miles Plumlee\u2019s contract along with Marco Belinelli. Two days later, on Draft night, the Bulls send three-time All-Star Jimmy Butler and the No. 16 pick to Minnesota for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and the No. 7 pick overall \u2014 Lauri Markkanen of Arizona . Four days after that, the LA Clippers, with no real choice, start blowing up their roster. They send the heart of their status as a legit title contender \u2014 nine-time All-Star point guard Chris Paul \u2014 to the Rockets (who\u2019ve long coveted him) for guard Patrick Beverley, forward Sam Dekker, Lou Williams and a lot of other players and picks the Rockets had to acquire and otherwise cobble together to make the numbers work. The Rockets then quickly move to try and add Carmelo Anthony. On July 1 \u2014 the first night of free agency \u2013 the Indiana Pacers get into the act by dealing four-time All-Star Paul George to Oklahoma City for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. Cleveland is soon rocked by Kyrie Irving\u2019s trade demands becoming public. A month later, the Cavs\u2019 new GM, Koby Altman, sends Irving to Boston, of all places , getting All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas back in a package that includes, most importantly, the unprotected 2018 first-rounder from Brooklyn that the Celtics have held onto and refused to included in other potential trades. And the Knicks\u2019 new braintrust finally ends the Anthony saga in New York just before the start of camp in late September, sending him not to Houston, but to Oklahoma City to join George and Russell Westbrook, for Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-rounder. The NBA landscape had been, in one summer, turned upside down. (Coda: \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d is very good.

The rebuild was set in motion by trading Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves last June , with point guard Kris Dunn, wing Zach LaVine and first-round pick Lauri Markkanen getting big minutes and absorbing all the Ls that young teams get. Things were exacerbated when Bobby Portis punched teammate Nikola Mirotic in the face during a practice altercation two days before the start of the season; Mirotic suffered facial fractures and a concussion, and missed Chicago\u2019s first 23 games recovering. Portis was suspended for eight games without pay. When Mirotic returned Dec. 8 , the Bulls were 3-20, having lost games by 49 at Golden State, 39 at San Antonio and 30 at Utah. The plan, though painful, was well on its way to fruition. But then, strange things started happening. Mirotic returned and played the best basketball of his career coming off the bench (even though he and Portis, understandably, are still on the outs). Unheralded, undrafted David Nwaba, the former Los Angeles Lakers guard who was a waiver claim in July, came back after missing 12 games and started providing outstanding two-way play . The Bulls began playing with the pace that Fred Hoiberg has desperately sought since becoming the team\u2019s coach. And Chicago, improbably, started winning. The Bulls beat Charlotte Dec. 8 and New York the next night, then blew out Boston by 23 and avenged the loss to the Jazz. They won at Milwaukee and beat then-hot Philadelphia, then throttled the Magic Dec. 20. In 12 days, they\u2019d won seven games in row. They\u2019ve cooled off a little since then, but they\u2019re still playing very good basketball \u2014 and jeopardizing their chances at a high pick, at least until they move Mirotic (they can\u2019t trade him until Jan. 15) and veteran center Robin Lopez, who\u2019s been very good in the middle. And Dunn, the 23-year-old who\u2019d flamed out in one desultory season of horrific shooting for Tom Thibodeau in Minnesota before being dealt, found his footing, both as a scorer and a floor general. He\u2019d been too good in college \u2014 a second-team All-American his senior season at Providence, where he worked and trained with God Shammgod. The former NBA player and fellow Friar \u2014 legendary for the crossover dribble that bears his name \u2014 was back at his alma mater as a grad assistant. Dunn\u2019s offensive rating leaped from 97.1 in November to 100.9 in December ; his assists rose from 4.3 to 7.8. He made a huge 3-pointer down the stretch to tie the game with Philly, and two more buckets to salt the game away. He broke down the Bucks for six points late and made two free throws with seven seconds left Friday to help beat New York. \u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019ve seen out of Kris is just his overall consistency at both,\u201d Hoiberg said Sunday. \u201cHe showed flashes early of really being in a stance, and then he\u2019d take plays off. But now, he\u2019s out there with a great focus and mentality. And the most impressive thing about Kris is just how he\u2019s learned to help finish games. It\u2019s not easy at this level.\u201d Shooting 3-pointers is still a work in progress for Dunn, but he\u2019s better than he was last season. And the Bulls are better than anyone thought they\u2019d be \u2014 and, frankly, than most of their fans want them to be. Me: How much of your improvement in the last few weeks is getting more comfortable with the speed of the game, and how much is guys like Mirotic and Portis getting back on the floor who can help you finish? Kris Dunn: I think Fred (Hoiberg) also helped me. He liked to play with a fast pace, get in the lane, be aggressive at the rim. We\u2019ve got a lot of shooters spread out when we can spread out. His offense helps. And when you\u2019ve got shooters around you, it\u2019s easier to get in the lane, especially when they\u2019re making shots. Everything opens up. I think we all watch a lot of film, and we\u2019re all starting to get used to each other. The chemistry\u2019s building. I think everybody knows their role on the team, so I think that helped us. Me: Was there any game in particular where it started clicking for you? KD: I can\u2019t really remember a game. But each and every game, I feel like I\u2019m improving, getting more comfortable, getting better. There\u2019s going to be bad games. There\u2019s 82 games; you can\u2019t be perfect all the time. But I\u2019m starting to learn, in order to be an elite player, you\u2019ve got to build consistent games. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to work on. Me: When you get your individual cutups from Paul (Miller, the Bulls\u2019 video coordinator), what\u2019s the first thing you look at? KD: Right now, just my pace. Pace is everything with this team. When we have good pace, and we\u2019re running out in transition, swinging the ball, I think we\u2019ve a good team. So I look at pace. Then I look at my decision making \u2014 was that the right read, at the right time? Turnovers. And then I go look at the defense. Me: Why are you more successful now making plays at the ends of games? KD: The game\u2019s slowing down for me at a tremendous rate. Last year, I couldn\u2019t even tell you what position \u2014 one, two, three. I\u2019m just out there, trying to impress the coach. That was what it was, and I couldn\u2019t really learn. This year I\u2019m learning. I\u2019m playing the role I\u2019m used, point guard. I\u2019m huge on film, so I watch a lot of film, see what I do wrong, see what I\u2019m doing good. Honestly, it\u2019s really slowing down for me. Me: Do you learn more from when you execute successfully at the ends of games, or when you don\u2019t? KD: When you don\u2019t succeed. When you succeed, it feels good. But when you don\u2019t succeed, you go back and look at the film, see what you missed, or if somebody else was open. Why the shot didn\u2019t go in. Every day, you can\u2019t be a hero, and I understood that. Me: Any point guards around the league you look at to see how they handle end of game situations? KD: Naw. To be honest, I look at Kobe, his mentality. He enjoys that situation. He always wants the ball. I study him a lot when it comes down the stretch, his footwork, being able to get to his spot. Even if the defender knows what spot he\u2019s going to go to, but still be able to get to that spot and still raise up and be able to make the play, that\u2019s fascinated me. I watch a lot of him. Me: Has the game gotten so 3-point heavy that there\u2019s more opportunities in the mid-post and for mid-range players than people realize? KD: Yeah. Nowadays, fours, they\u2019ve got to be able to shoot the ball, stretch the floor out. A person like me who likes to be aggressive, stay downhill, that helps me out a lot. \u2018Cause now I can either spray it out, or I can get the four man on me \u2014 he\u2019s got to switch. You\u2019ve got the four man on you, (it\u2019s) pick your poison kind of thing. I think the game evolving is a good thing for a lot of bigs, but it\u2019s even better on the guards, \u2018cause you can get to the basket. Me: But you\u2019re getting more comfortable shooting the three? KD: Yeah, definitely am. I\u2019m\u2019a keep shooting it. I\u2019ve got a lot of years ahead of me; I want to get comfortable with it. The more you shoot it, the more you get comfortable there, the more you\u2019ll be able to tweak the kinds of things you\u2019re doing wrong. You can make it more polished. I\u2019m gonna try to do it now, while I\u2019m young, so as the years come by I can make those tweaks in the offseason, and make it more polished. Me: How much are you staying in touch with Shammgod? KD: Oh, man, we talk, at least twice a week. That\u2019s my guy. He\u2019s doing an unbelievable job with Dennis (Smith, the Mavericks\u2019 rookie point guard) and all the other players. One thing about Sham, he\u2019s a good mentor of giving people confidence. Even when you feel like you\u2019re in a dark place, he\u2019s good at giving people confidence. Me: I imagine that was very necessary last year for you? KD: Yeah. You know, I knew it was going to be tough, coming in. I sensed it. I ain\u2019t know to deal with it at first. This was the first time I ever had to come off the bench, first time I didn\u2019t know what the coach wanted from me, and etcetera. It was a point in time during the season when I told myself, I can\u2019t let this get to me. My family\u2019s seen my whole personality change and everything, so I had to change it in the summer. I had to put in more work than I did the year before. I got a great group around me \u2014 my family, my friends, Shammgod. And he reached out to me to make sure I was doing the right things. It was really up to me to bounce back. Me: You\u2019ve got a young group here that\u2019s got a chance to get better. But you know that some of these guys could get dealt by the deadline. Is it hard to grow with this group not knowing what the future\u2019s going to bring? KD: Yeah, it definitely is. These guys are a great group of guys. Their character is unbelievable. It\u2019s going to throw the chemistry off a little bit (if) guys get traded. As a team, we\u2019re going to have to find a way to get through that. If they don\u2019t get traded, it\u2019s a blessing for us. We\u2019re playing good basketball. Everybody\u2019s starting to understand what their role is, and the chemistry is off the charts. It\u2019s tough to say. At the same time, it\u2019s a business \u2014 control what you can control. \u2014 Washington Nationals star outfielder Bryce Harper ( @Bharper3407 ), Wednesday, 2:46 p.m., after the Wizards unveiled their version of their City uniforms \u2014 which are, to be sure, fire. \u201c My son actually told me before the game, \u2018Daddy, I want you to make five threes.\u2019 I told him I will try. I can\u2019t promise. But I made eight actually. So I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very happy. And he was at the game too.\u201d \u2014 Nikola Mirotic , after scoring 28 points in 27 minutes in the improbable Bulls\u2019 ninth win in their last 11 games on Friday, over New York. \u201c The fans, the media wrote him off before he even went out and played. That\u2019s what I was upset about. You don\u2019t give him a chance to go out there and do what he\u2019s supposed to do. Give him a chance and then go from there. Just don\u2019t shoot him down because you\u2019re looking at the money. Because that\u2019s all you\u2019re looking at. You\u2019re not looking at his game and how he got better. You\u2019re looking at his money and you don\u2019t have to because everyone is getting paid [well] in this business. And Tim worked his tail off to get paid.\u201d \u2014 Tim Hardaway, Sr. , now a Pistons assistant coach, to the New York Post , defending his son Tim, Jr., from criticism that Sr. (correctly) felt was and is centered on the four-year, $71 million offer sheet from the Knicks to Hardaway, Jr., that the Hawks declined to match last summer. \u201dIt\u2019s basketball, it\u2019s not the Middle East peace process. It\u2019s not figuring out why our democracy is being eroded. It\u2019s pick-and-roll. Big deal.\u201d \u2014 Gregg Popovich , to local reporters, after being asked about the challenges of finding minutes for everyone on his roster now that Kawhi Leonard and other injured players are back in the rotation. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From William Proctor: No, they\u2019re not tanking anymore; this is an old-fashioned slump, brought about chiefly by regression on defense \u2014 which has been exacerbated by Embiid\u2019s absences (six of Philly\u2019s last 11 games through Saturday; not surprisingly, Philly is 0-6 in the games he\u2019s missed). Ben Simmons\u2019 defensive rating, for example, has blown up to 103.2 in December after being at 100.5 in November . He hasn\u2019t forgotten how to play defense; when you don\u2019t have that 7-foot equalizer in the back, your overplays and gambles tend to be exposed rather than rewarded. Robert Covington\u2019s shooting has slipped ( 28.1 percent since coming back Dec. 15 ). I don\u2019t think he\u2019s forgotten how to shoot, but it\u2019s a lot harder when defenses don\u2019t have to put two people in Embiid\u2019s lap and can jam the 3-point line. I think coach Brett Brown laid it out plainly last week: \u201cwe are third in the NBA defensively and sixth offensively with Joel. We go down to 29th defensively and 21st offensively without him. It\u2019s night and day. He is our crown jewel, that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d Handling his solo. From Cole Bertlesen: Absolutely, Cole. People around the league know how impressive Mitchell has been and the circumstances under which he\u2019s achieving those numbers. Market size has no impact, as the fact that four of the last five Rookies of the Year played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Milwaukee Bucks and Portland Trail Blazers should prove. Donovan will get a lot of first-place votes if he keeps this up and I\u2019d be very surprised if he\u2019s not, at worst, in the top three by the end of the season. Take off the shackles? From Kenn Becker Quiles: That won\u2019t happen, Kenn, because the league has made offensive flow and movement a priority over the last 20 years\u2019 worth of rules changes. The illegal defense adaptation in 1983 was designed specifically to discourage NBA teams from playing zone defenses regularly, since you normally plant a defender in the middle of the paint in most zone coverages and leave him there. The defensive 3-second violation means the paint will almost always be open for drivers, and that\u2019s what the league wants \u2014 talented ballhandlers, in space, playing downhill. There are, simply, more great guards than great big men, and the NBA has believed for some time now that fans want more offense. The advent of the 3-pointer as a primary weapon was the inevitable result of finding more and easier ways to put points on the board. The best way to ensure constant end-to-end action is to give the best players more opportunities to score. Clogging the paint with bigs would reduce those opportunities.

If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it (and peep the lady lamenting that the bear wrasslin\u2019 is going to make her late for work)! (Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (30.8 ppg, 4 rpg, 9.8 apg, .392 FG, .875 FT): Just 37 assists shy of passing Allen Leavell (3,339) for second place on the franchise\u2019s all-time list, behind Calvin Murphy (4,402). 2) LeBron James (21.7 ppg, 8 rpg, 8.7 apg, .439 FG, .706 FT): Turned 33 on Saturday, at which time he was a) averaging the most points in his career in eight years; b) averaging the most assists per game in his career; c) shooting better than 40 percent on threes for just the second time in his career. 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (24.3 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 4.3 apg, .604 FG, .800 FT): \u201cPlays like an angel every night\u201d could be one of the best calls for a player ever. 4) Kevin Durant (23.3 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 5.4 apg, .500 FG, .957 FT): Kia Defensive Player of the Year chatter building with KD\u2019s spike this season in blocked shots, but let\u2019s keep in mind that Draymond Green (100), Klay Thompson (100.8) and Stephen Curry (102.9) all have defensive ratings higher than Durant\u2019s (103.6) per NBA.com\/Stats. That\u2019s not at all meant to denigrate KD\u2019s improved defense, only to point out that Golden State defensive excellence stems from multiple players being able to switch and guard in space. 5) Kyrie Irving (26.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 4.8 apg, .461 FG, .938 FT): Career-best efficiency grounded in fewer minutes so far this season \u2014 32.4 compared with 35.1 last year. 16 \u2014 Consecutive wins by the San Antonio Spurs over the Brooklyn Nets in San Antonio, a streak that continued with last Tuesday\u2019s Spurs win over Brooklyn . The Nets\u2019 last franchise win in San Antonio was on Jan. 22, 2002 , when Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin starred, and ultimately led the then-New Jersey Nets to the NBA Finals. 40 \u2014 Days between wins at Moda Center for the Trail Blazers, which isn\u2019t good, considering it\u2019s their home court. Portland broke a six-game home losing streak there last Thursday, coming back from 18 down in the third quarter to beat Philadelphia; the Blazers\u2019 last home win had come on Nov. 18 over Sacramento. .578 \u2014 Three-point percentage (37 of 64) in December for New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 guard E\u2019Twaun Moore , quietly off to an insanely efficient start for New Orleans \u2014 the only holdback is his 61 percent form from the foul line. Otherwise, he\u2019s off the charts offensivelly \u2014 54 percent overall from the floor, 47 percent on threes, .633 Effective Field Goal percentage, .635 True Shooting Percentage \u2014 in averaging a career-best 13.3 points per game. 1) Happy 2018, everybody. I think we can all agree that while between the lines in the NBA, a lot went right in 2017, outside of many of those arenas, chaos and uncertainty and anger reined. May we all be more comforted, more united, but also more willing to speak up and speak out in the coming 12 months when we see injustice and unfair treatment of those who can\u2019t fight back. 2 ) I have a sense that the trade deadline, thought by many to likely be dull because so many teams are capped out or close to it, is going to be a little livelier than we all think. With small ball now dominant throughout the league, there are lots of good players who could help teams a player short flourish in the playoffs. The Bulls will almost certainly deal Nikola Mirotic, who\u2019s flourished in Chicago since his return, with a contract that\u2019s very affordable ($29 million through 2019, if the Bulls pick up the second-year option on his deal before sending him out). Vince Carter is 40, but he just put 24 on the Cavs , and he\u2019s only making $8 million, which is now closer to $4 million for a contending team on a pro-rated basis. The Lakers won\u2019t re-sign Julius Randle, who\u2019s been great for them off the bench all season, and have to move him by the deadline. With Enes Kanter playing so well, the Knicks will likely move one of their surplus bigs, either one of which is very serviceable: Kyle O\u2019Quinn or Willy Hernangomez. It\u2019s hard to believe Atlanta won\u2019t move Marco Belinelli (39 percent on 3-pointers), and that disappointing Charlotte won\u2019t soon be in selling mode, with vets like Marvin Williams and\/or Jeremy Lamb having value. 3) Kudos to Phoenix Coach Jay Triano for knowing the rules and directing Tyson Chandler to redirect a last-second inbounds pass from Dragan Bender into the basket to beat Memphis. Almost no one, starting with me, knew that touching an inbounded pass that goes above the cylinder and putting it in the basket cannot be called offensive goaltending. That rule certainly will be changed before the start of next season, but Triano won a game for his team by being sharp and on top of his Xs and Os, and good for him. 4) With or (preferably) without profanity, The Science Guy speaks for me . At some point, you either accept that an apple is an apple and not a kumquat, you know what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019m done with too-clever people who think questioning everything shows how evolved they are compared with the rest of us dullards. We can\u2019t all just stick our heads (figuratively) in the sand and say \u2018well, how do you know humans didn\u2019t live with dinosaurs?\u2019 We build our base of knowledge on what others before us have taught and come to believe, based on their own learning, and we continue to refine and improve upon what we\u2019ve all come to accept as \u201cfact.\u201d If we don\u2019t agree on certain things, societies cease to exist. We all agree that we stop driving our cars when the light turns red. It\u2019s not something we debate; we don\u2019t accept the opinions of those who might say, \u2018well, stopping on red infringes on my freedoms.\u201d We. Don\u2019t. Do. It. We stop on red. And the damn earth is round. 1) It\u2019s not Tony Brothers\u2019 or Gediminas Petraitis\u2019 fault that they missed five (!) traveling calls in the last two minutes of Thursday\u2019s wild 99-98 Boston win over Houston , according to the league\u2019s own Last Two Minutes report. That\u2019s why the NBA went to three-referee crews beginning with the 1988-89 season \u2014 two-man crews just couldn\u2019t catch everything. As Rod Thorn, then the league\u2019s VP of operations, said at the time : \u201dthe game has become faster and quicker and is being played by bigger people, and it\u2019s our opinion that an extra pair of eyes would aid in covering the entire court more.\u201d But the last-second injury to referee Mark Lindsay during pregame warmups Thursday, which necessitated Brothers and Petraitis working the game alone, exposed the problem of not having an on-site fourth ref for regular season games, a practice the NBA uses for every postseason game. No, refs almost never get hurt during warmups, and two-man crews because of injuries are very rare. (And, in some cases, in some cities \u2014 like Philadelphia, for example, where a lot of referees live \u2014 the league can get a replacement ref who\u2019s off that night to a game in time if something odd like Lindsay\u2019s back spasms occurs.) But it happened Thursday. And that loss for the Rockets could ultimately mean the difference between hosting a Game 7 of the Western Conference finals in Houston against the Golden State Warriors, or having to go to Oakland for that Game 7. The NBA is already committed to hiring more refs \u2014 it will increase its pool from the current 64 to 70 by next season and by 25 percent over the next three years, with the additional refs sitting courtside as \u201cgame administrators\u201d to help the flow between the on-court refs and the league\u2019s Replay Center. That timetable should be sped up in time to have four refs on site for every regular season game starting next season. 2) Our friend Stu Jackson has a good idea that would alleviate the non-reviewable loophole for plays like Friday\u2019s obvious out of bounds deal with Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s last-second game-winning dunk against Oklahoma City \u2014 give a coach one challenge in the last two minutes of regulation. That would push back slightly against the league\u2019s desire to increase the pace of play, but it\u2019s a necessary brake for obvious missed plays like \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d dunk. 3) Have one of these in my closet somewhere . https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBATV\/status\/947589502742261762\/photo\/1 4) Please leave him behind in 2017. * * * MORE MORNING TIP: Movie-like storylines marked 2017 | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Rockets not fretting mini-slump | Q&A: Kris Dunn * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The Houston Rockets looked invincible in November, winning 12 of 13, and snapped off 14 straight over the end of November and the beginning of December. They boatraced opponents, averaging 119.6 points per game and allowing just 103.4 , and shot almost 40 percent on 3-pointers. James Harden, Chris Paul, and Eric Gordon took turns from deep, with the usual support in kind from Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela and Ryan Anderson. The air was, rightly, full of talk that this was the team that could legitimately beat Golden State in a seven-game series. Then came December, and injuries to Paul, Capela and Luc Mbah a Moute, and the wheels came off. Paul, who\u2019d already missed 14 games earlier in the season with a bruised left knee, missed two games with a left adductor strain , but came back Friday. Capela returned on Sunday against the Lakers. But in the final minutes of regulation in the Rockets\u2019 double overtime win Sunday, which ended a five-game losing streak, Harden pulled up after a drive, and came up limping. He went straight to the locker room and didn\u2019t return, and was diagnosed with a strained hamstring . As of this morning, it\u2019s not known how long he\u2019ll be out. When Harden returns and gets back up to speed, the Rockets will certainly soon resume destroying opponents under a barrage of 3-pointers and rim runs, deflections and snuffed shots at the rim that lead to runouts, and fourth quarters for Harden and Paul with ice on their knees. But the temporary rough patch serves to illustrate how tenuous chemistry and momentum is to sustain over the six months of an NBA season, even for elite teams \u2014 and how opponents could potentially go after the Rockets in the playoffs. \u201cWe know what we have to do,\u201d an unconcerned Paul said after the loss to the Washington Wizards on Friday . \u201cWe have to get it right. We\u2019re not tripping, because we know how we play. I\u2019m a big believer in building and winning. I said that a long time ago. You don\u2019t need to learn stuff and lose. Learn stuff and win, and we done lost a few. All in all, we came out healthy. For us, that\u2019s part of the process. We\u2019re cool.\u201d For more than a week, though, everything went wrong \u2014 inexplicable back-to-back home losses to the Los Angeles Lakers and the LA Clippers before Christmas. There was a Christmas Day loss in Oklahoma City late , and an impossible collapse in Boston , with Houston blowing a 26-point first-half lead and then getting some bad calls in the last five minutes of the game. But it should have never gotten to that point in the first place. And the losing streak reached five Friday, the team\u2019s longest in almost five years, with a tired Rockets team not getting to D.C. until 3 a.m. They then got run out of Capital One Arena in the second half. \u201cIt\u2019s still there, but we\u2019ve just got to focus on what we really need to do,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cGolden State, they\u2019ve won championships. They know who they are. With us, we just need to continue to play the style of basketball we were early on \u2014 we were playing fast, playing, trusting each other on defense. Once we do that for a consistent year, then we can focus on Golden State. I just think we\u2019ve got to take it one step at a time. We\u2019ve still got a lot of new guys. Yeah, we were hot for a second, and we can get on another hot streak again. We\u2019re not really worried. But we\u2019ve got to do the little things.\u201d There\u2019s a reason Harden was all in for getting Paul. His absence put that weight vest of expectations right back on Harden, a burden he carried heroically all last season, but which overwhelmed him in the playoffs. In the postseason, Harden shot 41.3 percent overall and 27.8 percent on 3-pointers , tapping out with a horrific 2 of 11 performance in a 39-point loss to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals. The Rockets couldn\u2019t afford for Harden to run out of gas again. But it\u2019s imperative that Paul be upright and in uniform in May and June. \u201cWe ask so much of James, and that\u2019s why we went out and got Chris,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cBecause James was making every determining play, and he gets tired. Anybody would. So there are moments where he\u2019s completely overloaded, and he has a turnover. And now, we can take all those plays away from him \u2014 when he\u2019s making, instead of 50 decisions, let\u2019s say 40, or 30. It\u2019s 30 without being tired decisions. That\u2019s huge.\u201d The impact of Paul\u2019s absence was obvious \u2014 an all-world ballhandler who can create, score and pass at an elite level while offering terrific on-ball and help defense. And for Houston, Paul\u2019s impact on Harden alone is worth whatever deal the Rockets work out with him, whether now (Paul is now eligible for a contract extension) or next summer, when he hits unrestricted free agency. No one around the league expects anything other than him re-signing with Houston. But the absence of Mbah a Moute, out since dislocating his right shoulder Dec. 13, has impacted Houston more than you\u2019d think. His defensive bona fides should go without saying at this point and having him on the floor with P.J. Tucker at the end of games gives the Rockets multiple switching options defensively. Offensively, Mbah a Moute has struggled so far on corner 3-pointers \u2014 just 7 of 30 so far, per NBA.com\/Stats \u2014 he\u2019s been extremely good getting the ball to the front of the rim on drives and cuts , as most are who play off of Harden and Paul.  Capela\u2019s absence may be the biggest of all, both short and long term. Houston\u2019s demeanor changes completely when the 23-year-old isn\u2019t on the floor. He missed the two games before Sunday with a right orbital fracture \u2026 after missing two of three games before that with a bruised heel. The Rockets want to keep his backup, Nene, healthy for the playoffs and he\u2019s on a strict non- back-to-back schedule during the regular season. But when he\u2019s pressed into service when Capela\u2019s out, that has a ripple effect. \u201cThe thing that Clint does is, we spread the floor open,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cWith him, he\u2019s catching lobs. And when he\u2019s not there, we don\u2019t throw lobs, hardly, to anybody to put pressure on the defense. And, he\u2019s a rim protector. We don\u2019t have a true, true rim protector when he\u2019s not there. He definitely plays a major role, for sure. He plays a major role in what we do.\u201d D\u2019Antoni has tried to make things as easy as possible, eliminating shootarounds. Houston arrives at its road destination early enough the day before to practice and go over opponents then, rather than the morning of the game. \u201cWe think rest is more important and we cover the opposing team the day before in practice,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, adding that he can call an audible when necessary. \u201cWe feel the determining factor for us is having the right energy.\u201d Even though General Manager Daryl Morey has made no secret of the fact that he\u2019s got nothing but the Warriors on his mind, Paul seems to want his group to emulate the San Antonio Spurs rather than Golden State. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret they\u2019re the defending champions,\u201d he said of the Warriors. \u201cThey\u2019ve won the West, what, three years in a row? So until somebody beats them, they\u2019re the reigning champs. You can do that if you want to, but it\u2019s a league that changes. It changes. We were No. 1 in the West a couple of days ago. When you\u2019ve been around long enough, you realize it\u2019s all about how you\u2019re playing. Where\u2019s San Antonio right now? Told they were just behind Houston after the Rockets\u2019 losing streak, Paul said, \u201cthey ain\u2019t tripping. They just want to get their guys healthy.\u201d If Paul\u2019s not on the floor, teams get much more aggressive against Houston. The Celtics picked up Harden full court for long stretches Thursday, looking to wear him down, and did the same whenever Gordon brought up the ball. It led to a lot more one-pass-and-shoot shots for the Rockets rather than the ball whipping around like it normally does. And Harden and Gordon were just 5 of 27 combined from the floor in the second half and overtime. Now, Houston must wait for Harden to heal before it can get back on track. With back to back games in Orlando Wednesday and against the Warriors at Toyota Center Thursday, one would guess \u201cThe Beard\u201d would take off Wednesday to have a chance to play against the champs the next night. The Rockets beat Golden State on opening night with their full squad, but Paul then went out with the bruised knee. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re going to be up there,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cWe just need to concentrate on what we need to do. We were hot, we was doing all the little things, helping each other. Now, we\u2019ve hit a skid where offensively, we\u2019re not \u2026 Golden State, I look at them, they\u2019re getting almost 30 assists a night, and we\u2019re not doing that, and we play just as fast as they do. That\u2019s the point we\u2019ve got to get to, moving the ball and helping each other on defense. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to realize: once that ball moves, everybody scores, in big numbers. You can\u2019t score big numbers if that assist number ain\u2019t going up. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to understand.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Movie-like storylines marked 2017 | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | DA\u2019s Mailbag on Sixers, Mitchell & more | Q&A: Kris Dunn * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe  spoke to Silas recently : If the Hornets don\u2019t turn their season around soon, they could be sellers at the trade deadline.

They\u2019re one of the hottest teams in the league and doing so without adding a significant piece to the rotation, unless you count Nikola Mirotic\u2019s return from a broken face on Dec. 8, and yes, that\u2019s had an impact. They\u2019ve won 10 of 12 with the two losses coming to the Celtics and Cavs, both on the road. So what does this mean? This means they must trade Mirotic, of course. Yes, they could keep the player who has suddenly become very dangerous and is averaging 20 points since recovering from teammate Bobby Portis\u2019 fist . Yet he is now an asset who could also go the other way, meaning, if the Bulls play their cards right and another team shows some desperation\/interest, the Bulls can get something for him prior to the approaching deadline. The Bulls are somewhat stacked on the front line and can afford to reduce the herd if they can fill a need with an exchange, say, more backcourt depth (yes, Zach LaVine is nearing a return , but still) and a tougher low-post big man, they should seriously consider it. Apparently, David Haugh of the C hicago Tribune  agrees something must be done : Not sure if Mirotic will fetch anything close to a lottery pick and maybe not even a mid-first-rounder, but this is a great situation for the Bulls to be in, to have someone that another team might want.

That would be Donovan Mitchell, the Jazz rookie who idolized LeBron and yet also wanted to beat him. And so, down the stretch of an unexpectedly exciting Jazz-Cavs game, Mitchell outplayed the King and helped the Jazz squeeze out a 104-101 win . It\u2019s been that kind of season, for the most part, for Mitchell, and it has come right on time for the Jazz. Still wounded over the summertime departure of Gordon Hayward, the Jazz perhaps found their next star in Mitchell, and if so, it would follow a familiar pattern for the Jazz in the post-Malone\/Stockton era. They drafted Deron Williams and he became a franchise-type player, then was traded. They drafted Hayward and he, too, became a franchise rock before he left through free agency. Now it\u2019s Mitchell, and the good news is he\u2019ll be under contract for at least two more seasons. The even better news: Utah has already fallen all over him. The day before the Cavs game, a line of fans stretching an estimated quarter-mile waited at a local mall to see Mitchell. Eric Woodyard of the Deseret News was there : Mitchell finished with 29 points (matching LeBron) with six assists and four rebounds and in a sign of respect, his teammates gave him first-option status late in the game. That shows how much confidence the entire organization has in Mitchell, who has fought through the expected up-and-downs this season to gain more confidence.

His little girl cleared the way and off her dad went running as hard as he could to the locker room. \u201cSolid,\u201d Curry said with a grin of his sprint . Healthy at last. The Warriors star was all smiles during pregame warmups and set to start Saturday night against the Memphis Grizzlies in his return to the court after missing 11 games for Golden State with a sprained right ankle. Coach Steve Kerr said his plan would be to play Curry in 6- to 7-minute stretches and aim to keep the two-time MVP below 30 minutes total. \u201cIdeally four of those bursts sounds about right to me, but this is not an exact science, so we\u2019ve discussed it with Chelsea (Lane) and with Steph about it,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo this will be a case of he\u2019s got to give us feedback as to how he\u2019s feeling. I will keep an eye on him in terms of his wind and his conditioning but ideally 20-25 minutes would be nice. Well, he looks great but he hasn\u2019t played in an NBA basketball game, which is totally different than guarding Willie Green in a 3-on-3 scrimmage, nothing against Willie, Willie\u2019s a great friend and a hell of a coach but he\u2019s no longer playing in the NBA. So it\u2019d be tough to judge Steph\u2019s conditioning on that matchup.\u201d While Kerr said Curry had done everything in his power to prepare to get back Saturday, \u201cthere\u2019s no substitute for game action.\u201d The Warriors went 9-2 during Curry\u2019s absence. He is averaging a team-leading 26.3 points \u2013 just more than Kevin Durant\u2019s 26.1 \u2013 6.6 assists and 5.1 rebounds. \u201cIf he\u2019s out there, I expect him to be at a high level. I know for guys that haven\u2019t played, there\u2019s normally some rust, but for a guy with his skill set, I expect the rust to minimal,\u201d Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \u201cWhen you can shoot it the way that he can shoot it and the work that he\u2019s put in on his ball handling, passing and all those things, we expect him to be at a high level.\u201d Kerr is hopeful the extended rest for his star point guard now to get fully healthy will benefit Curry down the stretch and in the postseason for the defending champions. Golden State shined during Durant\u2019s 19-game absence last spring ahead of the playoffs, then went 15-1 on the way to a second title in three years and Durant earned NBA Finals MVP. \u201cGiven the comprehensive four-year run in terms of going deep into the playoffs the last three and hopefully again this year, a little rest here and there does not hurt, both physically and mentally and emotionally,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSteph I\u2019m really excited to get back out tonight. Sometimes the absence of a month of basketball gives you a little more excitement and energy and I know he feels that way and it\u2019ll probably do the same thing with our crowd and with our team, too.\u201d"},{"id":42548,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/austin-rivers-negative-achilles-injury","date":"2017-12-30","title":"Report: Los Angeles Clippers' Austin Rivers has Achilles strain, listed as day to day","content":"Los Angeles Clippers point guard Austin Rivers, who left after Friday\u2019s game on crutches, had an MRI Saturday and was diagnosed with a right Achilles strain.
