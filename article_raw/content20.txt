Over the last 20 (full) seasons, there has been a strong correlation between a team\u2019s record after 20 games and its record at the end of the season. Really, there\u2019s a pretty strong correlation between a team\u2019s record after just 10 games and how it finishes the season. The correlation grows with each game and the 20-game mark isn\u2019t a significant inflection point in that regard. It is 1\/4 of the way through the season and a benchmark that many teams use to take measure of just what kind of team they are. Like, if you haven\u2019t won at least seven of those first 20 games, you\u2019re most certainly not going to make the playoffs. Only four of the 106 teams that have won fewer than seven of their first 20 games over the last 20 (full) seasons have gone on to reach the postseason. The last of those was the 2013-14 Brooklyn Nets, who started 6-14, finished as the No. 6 seed in the East (at 44-38) , and actually won a first-round series. On the other end of the spectrum, 92 percent of the 215 teams that have won at least 12 of their first 20 games have gone on to make the playoffs. That translates to about one miss per year, with last season\u2019s Memphis Grizzlies (who started 12-8) and the 2017-18 Detroit Pistons (the only Eastern Conference team of the last 20 full seasons that has won 14 of its first 20 games and failed to make the playoffs) being the latest two examples. * Smith: Key dates to know for 2019-20 The Grizzlies didn\u2019t have that easy of an early schedule last season. Eleven of their first 20 games were against teams that finished with winning records, and 10 of their first 20 were on the road. They obviously couldn\u2019t keep it together after a strong start, but their \u201918-19 season was more the exception than the rule. The schedule eventually balances itself out, but every team wants to get off to a good start. And some will have an easier time than others. The New Orleans Pelicans and Oklahoma City Thunder are two of the league\u2019s more interesting teams on paper. Both teams traded their best players, but they each still have a seemingly competent rotation remaining. If the pieces \u2014 both young and old \u2014 come together in the right way, either (or both) of these teams could be competing for playoff spots. But to remain relevant through the All-Star break, the Pelicans and Thunder will have to survive the league\u2019s two toughest schedules through 20 games. There were 15 teams that had winning records last season. All but two of the league\u2019s 30 teams will play no more than 12 of their first 20 games against that group, and the two exceptions are the Pelicans and Thunder. The Pelicans will play 15 of their first 20 games against teams that had winning records last season. One of the other five will be against against the Los Angeles Lakers, who (with former Pelican Anthony Davis) are very likely to finish with a winning record this season. And New Orleans will play four of its 12 back-to-backs within those first 20 games. The Thunder, meanwhile, will play 14 of their first 20 games against teams that had winning records last season. Two of their other six will be against the Lakers. And within that first 20 games, they will have three *rest-disadvantage games, but just one rest-advantage game. * A rest advantage or disadvantage is when one team is playing the second game of a back-to-back and the other didn\u2019t play the day before. Here are the records of home teams over the last three seasons\u2026 Interestingly, the Pelicans and Thunder will play each other three times \u2014 twice in Oklahoma City and once in New Orleans \u2014 within their first 20 games, with a home-and-home series on Nov. 29 and Dec. 1. If one team is struggling to get it together early on, the other could take advantage. The toughest first 20 games in the Eastern Conference \u2014 when taking opponents, home vs. road, and rest into account \u2014 belongs to the Atlanta Hawks . The Hawks were, statistically, the league\u2019s fourth-most improved team after the All-Star break last season. Given the strength of their first 20 games in \u201919-20, it will be tough for them to turn that into a stronger start this year. The Hawks\u2019 first 20 games include 13 games (most in the East) against teams that finished at or above .500 last season and 11 road games. Five of those 11 are part of a trip (their longest of the season) that concludes with an L.A.-L.A. back-to-back, one of five back-to-backs (most in the league) that the Hawks will have in their first 20 games. The second games of four of those five back-to-backs will be rest-disadvantage games, but the Hawks will have just one rest-advantage game (their first game of the season) in their first 20. The Denver Nuggets are set to lead the league in continuity, with more than 92 percent of last season\u2019s minutes having been played by guys who are still on the roster. And that\u2019s not the only thing that could allow them to hit the ground running. In regard to the cumulative 2018-19 winning percentage of their opponents, the Nuggets have the league\u2019s easiest first 20 games. They\u2019ll play 13 of their first 20 games (most in the league) against teams that had losing records last season . One of the other seven will be against the Lakers, but that game (on Dec. 3) will be in Denver, where the Nuggets will play 11 of their first 18 before heading East for a four-game trip. Last season, the Nuggets were 13.1 points per 100 possessions better at home than on the road, and that was the league\u2019s biggest differential. Overall, the first 20 games is balanced in regard to home-away. Only six of the league\u2019s 30 teams don\u2019t have at least nine home games and at least nine road games in their first 20. The league has once again reduced the average number of back-to-backs for each team. This season, the average is 12.4 back-to-backs per team, down from 13.3 last season and 19.3 five years ago. Teams will have no fewer than 11 and no more than 14 back-to-backs. Last season, the range was 12-15, and in 2014-15, it was 16-22. There\u2019s been less of a reduction in rest-advantage games, from 300 last season to 293 this season. That\u2019s still an all-time low, but there remains a bigger variance in the number of rest-advantage (and rest-disadvantage) games than there is in the number of back-to-backs. While the back-to-back range is 12-15, teams have as few as five and as many as 16 rest-advantage games. They also have as few as five and as many as 13 rest-disadvantage games. On the low end of the former is the Orlando Magic , who have a league-low five rest-advantage games (and one of the five is the last game of the season). The New York Knicks , meanwhile, have 16, including two four-game stretches (one in November and one going into the All-Star break) where they\u2019ll have three rest-advantage games. The Chicago Bulls have a league-low five rest-disadvantage games, and the first one isn\u2019t until Jan. 11 (Game 40) in Detroit. In fact, in none of the Bulls \u2018 first 25 games will either team have a rest advantage. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Phoenix Suns have the most rest-disadvantage games (13). The Suns have three in a seven-game stretch in December, while the Cavs have four in their first 13 games after the All-Star break. If you subtract rest-disadvantage games from rest-advantage games to get an overall \u201crest advantage factor\u201d for each team\u2019s 82 games, the Bulls (11 rest-advantage games, five rest-disadvantage games) and Knicks (16, 10) have the easiest schedule, with no other team having a differential greater than three. The Magic (five, 10) and Washington Wizards (seven, 12) have the biggest differentials in the other direction.   * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2014 Someday, years or even decades from now, at one of those celebratory reunions teams like to do, Stephen Curry knows he and Kevin Durant will reminisce with fondness about their three insanely successful years together on the Golden State Warriors. They will reflect on the greatness, the fun, all they learned from each other shooting side by side day after day. Two championships, a pair of NBA Finals MVP awards for Durant. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember the three years we had. We\u2019ll probably be back here down the road celebrating those like they did the \u201974-75 team,\u201d Curry said, nodding in the direction of the Warriors\u2019 recent championship banners. \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool when that happens.\u201d For now, Curry is embracing \u201cnew beginnings\u201d as the oldest player on a Golden State roster that will look far different come training camp next month \u2014 and that also was the theme he shared with girls attending his Warriors camp this week in one of his \u201cbittersweet\u201d final trips to the downtown Oakland practice facility before a move to San Francisco and the new Chase Center. Durant, recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured right Achilles tendon, has departed to join the Brooklyn Nets. \u201cWe won two championships and I think we both got better throughout the process as basketball players and as people,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWith the demand every single night to be great and just all that that comes with, in terms of the media attention, the scrutiny, the criticism, the praise even, it\u2019s a lot to handle. And I think me and him especially on that level could connect. Him going to Brooklyn, you\u2019re just trying to make sure he\u2019s happy and going to a place where he feels like he needs to be. At the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to be happy about that for him.\u201d Also gone are veterans Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, guard Quinn Cook and big man DeMarcus Cousins. Meanwhile, the Warriors have added a handful of new faces like D\u2019Angelo Russell, Willie Cauley-Stein and Glenn Robinson III. Draymond Green got a new four-year deal earlier this month worth close to $100 million. Kevon Looney re-signed, too. As Klay Thompson works back this season from surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee that he injured in the deciding Game 6 loss of the finals to the Toronto Raptors, Curry\u2019s backcourt mate will be Russell. At 31, Curry doesn\u2019t mind that he will be the quote-unquote old guy entering his 11th NBA season. A two-time NBA MVP, he has reached five straight NBA Finals. \u201cHas it sunk in? No. Have people been reminding me? Yes, any time they bring up our team looking forward,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s cool though, hopefully I\u2019m wise beyond my years but still youthful in what I can do on the floor. It\u2019s just a change in dynamic all the way around. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities, the challenges for the whole roster, because we\u2019ve got a lot of guys that have the opportunity to really prove themselves and make a difference in our team. Obviously our core, \u2019til Klay gets back, we know how to win and we know how to play. We\u2019re just going to do it a little differently.\u201d Curry is unconcerned at this stage about outside expectations regarding how good this group might be and speculation that these Warriors may not be a championship contender. \u201cI know the reality of the situation in terms of we lost a guy like Kevin Durant, who\u2019s an all-time great basketball player,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe lost two veteran high-IQ guys in Shaun and Andre that really were like the cogs in the wheel that kept us going and you could rely on them every single game. So, the look is different but nobody really has a sustained run like we did where every year you\u2019re expected to be the greatest. It\u2019s just a matter of now we have to, I wouldn\u2019t even say prove people wrong, but we have to kind of galvanize the new roster and do the exact same thing.\u201d As he told the girl campers all sporting his No. 30 jersey, first things first. Curry took a quick poll of how many had started school again. Dozens of hands shot into the air. \u201cGreat to see you all again! You all having a great day, too?\u201d Collective \u201cYeah!\u201d \u201cNew beginnings, right? We\u2019re going to take care of our school work this year?\u201d Curry asked. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very dedicated and hard-working in the classroom as we are on the basketball court? That\u2019s very important to be well-rounded people, right? Athletes and academics.\u201d"},{"id":32228,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-how-many-wins-raptors-and-warriors","date":"2019-08-14","title":"Blogtable: How many wins for Raptors, Warriors in 2019-20?","content":"* * * How many wins for the Raptors this season? How many for the Warriors?   * * * Steve Aschburner : Toronto was 17-5 on the nights Kawhi Leonard did not play last season, but selectively choosing his absences is different from enduring them across all 82 games. Golden State was 1-0 when playing without both Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, a throwaway of No. 81 that offers no insight into how the Warriors will fare without the former at all in 2019-20 and the latter for a good chunk of the schedule. I think both teams are wired to top .500, though, and make the playoffs as lower seeds \u2014 the Warriors winning 45-47 times and the Raptors around 42-43 victories (assuming they don\u2019t pull the plug by the trade deadline). Shaun Powell :  The East isn\u2019t exactly loaded, so even without Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors should knock on the door of 50 wins (but l et\u2019s put them a few short, say 48). As for the Warriors sans Durant, that\u2019s a tougher chore in the big-boy West, and there\u2019s no telling when Thompson suits up or how D\u2019Angelo Russell clicks with Stephen Curry. This smells like 47 wins for Golden State, and maybe that\u2019s giving them too much respect. John Schuhmann : The Raptors were an amazing 17-5 without Leonard last season, but they also had Danny Green, who was a huge part of that no-Kawhi success. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby should only get better, but it\u2019s also possible that Raptors GM Masai Ujiri will trade some of his vets on expiring contracts rather than lose them for nothing next summer. Even if he keeps the group together, the Raptors will take a step backward, landing in the 46-50-win range . With Thompson out, the Warriors have a lot more questions than answers on the wings, especially if D\u2019Angelo Russell isn\u2019t a good fit in coach Steve Kerr\u2019s offense. But they still have Curry and Draymond Green, who are keystones to an elite offense and defense, respectively. This feels hard to peg down than a prediction for the Raptors, because chemistry is more of a question, but put the Western Conference champs in the same 46-50-win range .  Sekou Smith : Even with Kawhi Leonard having for the Western Conference, the Toronto Raptors will have enough to be one of the more formidable teams in the Eastern Conference. A 47-50 win season is a reasonable expectation for the reigning champs , who should be a bunch toughened up by the things they experienced during their championship run. The Warriors have a different challenge. No team lost more firepower from last season than the Warriors, who will open the Chase Center without Durant, Thompson (inured), Andre Iguodala (traded), DeMarcus Cousins (signed with Lakers) and Shaun Livingston (waived). If Golden State wins 48 games \u2014 the total usually needed to be playoff contention in the West \u2014 Curry and Green will have to stay injury-free and play at the highest level all season long."},{"id":32225,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-watching-intently-2019-20","date":"2019-08-14","title":"Blogtable: What (or who) are you watching intently to open 2019-20?","content":"* * * What (or who) will you be watching intently during the first 20 games of the season?   * * * Steve Aschburner : I\u2019d be lying if I said anyone other than the New Orleans Pelicans and specifically Zion Williamson. Newness abounds in the NBA, but 20 games won\u2019t be enough to evaluate most of it. That won\u2019t stop a lot of us from formulating opinions and making quickie pronouncements about Harden and Westbrook in Houston, about the hobbled Warriors or the abandoned Raptors, about Leonard and George with the Clippers, and so on. But Williamson\u2019s toe-dipping into NBA waters could be full of early surprises, even if we can\u2019t lock in his future immediately, and the crowds in New Orleans and everywhere else the Pelicans play in the first 20 games will be primed to join in any fun. I\u2019ll be honest and admit a little rooting interest, too, for a franchise that didn\u2019t deserve to have its cornerstone guy tap out the way Anthony Davis did. Shaun Powell :  Love to see the early returns on the James Harden-Russell Westbrook combo in Houston. Do they mesh? Do they go overboard being too unselfish and sensitive about each other? Or do they click immediately and without much of a transition? Two superstars who need the ball are always tricky. John Schuhmann : With all the player movement from this summer, the answer is \u2026 a lot! In the East, Philadelphia is at the top of the list , mostly to see if Ben Simmons will shoot a jumper, but also to see what kind of shape Joel Embiid is in, how much the offense changes with the departures of Jimmy Butler and J.J. Redick, and if the Sixers can be the best defensive team in the league. In the West , the Rockets, Clippers and Lakers will be fascinating, but Utah is also really intriguing. If Donovan Mitchell (with the help of Mike Conley) can break out offensively (and he has shown signs of just that in national team camp), the Jazz could be this year\u2019s Bucks (though they\u2019re coming from a better spot), taking the leap from playoff team to title contender with top-five potential on both ends of the floor.  Sekou Smith : We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if all eyes lock in on the power struggle in the revamped Western Conference, where as many as six teams (Clippers, Lakers, Nuggets, Rockets, Trail Blazers and Jazz) fancy themselves as legitimate championship contenders. But I\u2019ll have my focus on Kyrie Irving\u2019s adjustment (and start) to the season in Brooklyn , which I believe will be as fascinating to watch as anything in the early going. Without Kevin Durant available and a confident supporting cast ready for the next step in their evolution, Kyrie will have a ton of added pressure to make sure what happened in Boston last season doesn\u2019t repeat itself in Brooklyn."},{"id":32255,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-will-have-biggest-turnaround-2019-20","date":"2019-08-14","title":"Blogtable: Which team will have biggest turnaround in 2019-20?","content":"* * * Which team do you predict will have the biggest turnaround in 2019-20?   * * * Steve Aschburner : There might be as many definitions of \u201cturnaround\u201d in a sports context as there are for \u201cvaluable\u201d (such as assessing Most Valuable). But I\u2019ll keep it simple and go with the most additional victories in 2019-20 compared to last season. For me, then, the choice is easy: the Lakers. They are going to clean up multiple messes \u2014 no finishing below .500 this time, no missing the postseason \u2014 and add 20 victories while shaving 20 losses from their 37-45 record. LeBron James will have had a long offseason \u2014 basketball-wise, at least \u2014 and quite possibly be primed for a monstrous individual performance in the year he turns 35. There will be a bounce in that building, too, thanks to Anthony Davis\u2019 arrival and the aura of the LA Clippers , those ambitious housemates from down the hall. Shaun Powell :  Well, obviously the Lakers , assuming good health to their two franchise players, should win 15-plus more games in the regular season. And simply by making the playoffs, that would be a great step up from a disappointing 2018-19. That\u2019s an easy call. As for a more purer improvement, let\u2019s try the Pelicans because David Griffin mixed together a great gumbo of youth and vets. John Schuhmann :  The Clippers and Lakers are the obvious picks to make the biggest jumps in the win column. In the non-obvious division, the Pelicans and Heat have opportunities to win 8-10 more games than they did last season. New Orleans lost Anthony Davis, but has a lot more perimeter talent than it did last season, when it was also pretty awful on defense (where Lonzo Ball and Derrick Favors will help). Miami is in the East, added Jimmy Butler , and may have undergone some addition by subtraction with the departure of Hassan Whiteside paving the way for a Bam Adebayo breakout season.  Sekou Smith :  The Los Angeles Lakers are poised to take a huge leap forward from the 37 wins they finished with last season. James and Davis together (and healthy) demands at least 50 wins, even in this era of load management. There is absolutely no way anything less than 50 wins should be acceptable this season for the Lakers, who have legitimate championship aspirations for the first time in a decade. There is no other team that added the firepower to suggest they\u2019d increase their win total by more than what the Lakers should be able to amass after paring up two of the NBA\u2019s top players."},{"id":32232,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/usa-notebook-kemba-walker-leadership","date":"2019-08-14","title":"Team USA Notebook: Kemba Walker absorbs new role of veteran leader","content":" EL SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2014 Kemba Walker is still adjusting to the idea of being an \u201celder statesmen,\u201d a tag he never really prepared himself for as he was grinding away through the first few years of his NBA career. But he\u2019s getting a huge dose of it now and for the foreseeable future. As one of the veteran leaders in camp as the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team prepares for the FIBA World Cup , he\u2019s living that role every day. And he\u2019s doing it alongside three of his younger USA teammates \u2014 Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart \u2014 he\u2019ll work with in Boston when the 2019-20 NBA season begins. This opportunity to fine-tune their chemistry and build camaraderie ahead of next season is one of the benefits of their time together this summer. Walker said as much as Team USA wrapped up practice Tuesday night at the UCLA Health Training Center. \u201cThey\u2019re just some really good young dudes and I just enjoy being around them,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd the age difference is really crazy to me. J.T. is like 21 and J.B. is 22 and Marcus is 25. And I\u2019m 29 and feeling like, wow, this is cool. It sounds crazy. I remember when I was 21 in this league. I was a rookie and just trying to figure it all out. And these guys are young vets already. Like I said, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d And ideal if you are Celtics\u2019 boss Danny Ainge, who attended Tuesday\u2019s practice, or Celtics coach Brad Stevens. The bonds developed now will help forge a brotherhood that was clearly missing last season. Chemistry issues sank the Celtics\u2019 hopes of contending for a third straight trip to the Eastern Conference finals in what turned out to be Kyrie Irving and Al Horford\u2019s final season in Boston. Given all that the Celtics\u2019 quartet is learning about each other this summer, chemistry shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Walker praised his young teammates for their diligence and work ethic while marveling at their ability to pick up the nuances and changes that comprise FIBA World Cup play. \u201cEverybody comes here knowing they\u2019ll have to sacrifice some of the things they are used to doing for the greater good and they get that,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd for me, having some experience and being one of the older guys here, it\u2019s a great opportunity to show some leadership and also humble myself in this process. But the chance for these young guys to showcase their talents is really dope. I\u2019m glad to be here with someone like [U.S. Coach Gregg Popovich] running it and to be a part of it, because normally these are guys I\u2019m battling with every night and now we get a chance to work together. The sky is the limit for what they can do and I just love being a part of this stage of it all.\u201d Tatum, Brown and Smart have each gained insight into Walker\u2019s game as well \u2014 in particular what it\u2019s like to see the All-Star guard work every day. \u201cFor me, I\u2019ve noticed that Kemba can really play defense when he wants to do it,\u201d Smart said and then laughed. \u201cYou know it\u2019s tough, when you see how much energy he had to exert on the offensive end [in Charlotte], but he\u2019s actually a really good defensive player, especially at his size. You find out that the little guys are usually more feisty and tenacious. But he can play defense and you didn\u2019t really see that or notice that because he had so much of a load on him offensively that it was probably harder for him to do that.\u201d Smart agreed with Walker\u2019s point about everyone here in camp having to play roles as opposed to focusing on what they might be used to on their respective NBA teams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys who on their respective teams are the man or whatever you want to call it,\u201d Smart said. \u201cThey\u2019re either the first, second or third option on their team and here they might not even be fourth or fifth. It takes a lot of humility to look yourself in the face and say, \u2018okay, what does this team need from me?\u2019 And be ready to do it. If it means stepping outside of what I do normally, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.

They are deep, they are talented and they are going to work their fannies off. And they want to win, just like we do or anybody else who is in the tournament. You know, people will talk, but that\u2019s usually not something I respond to.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Telfair \u2014 a once highly touted point guard with a disappointing pro basketball career and a history of brushes with the law \u2014 had been convicted earlier this year of carrying a loaded handgun in his pickup truck. \u201cThe mandatory prison sentence he received today is required by law and he has now been held accountable for the unlawful conduct,\u201d Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement. There was no immediate response to a phone message on Monday seeking comment from Telfair\u2019s attorney. Gonzalez said that a jury heard testimony describing how at 2:50 a.m. on June 11, 2017, officers in an unmarked police car spotted a Ford F-150 parked on a center median in Brooklyn with the 34-year-old Telfair at the wheel. The officers stopped the truck after it made a U-turn in front of them and drove off with no headlights on. Seeing a lit marijuana cigarette in the console, they said they searched the vehicle and found a loaded .45-caliber pistol inside. The Brooklyn-born Telfair was a first-round draft pick out of high school in 2004. He started with the Portland Trail Blazers and spent time with the Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves and other teams before ending his career in China in 2014. Telfair and a friend were arrested in 2007 after a traffic stop during which police found a loaded handgun in the vehicle.

Rookies, rivalries, redemption stories, return games and all the drama that comes along with that litany of storylines are on tap for the 2019-20 season. And with Monday\u2019s release of the full \u201919-20 season schedule , we can all begin to plot our own course through what promises to be a wildly entertaining \u2014 and unpredictable \u2014 season. For the first time in years there is no clear-cut, prohibitive favorite to win the Larry O\u2019Brien championship trophy. Some have even proclaimed the \u201cSuper Team\u201d era over. The list of teams who fancy themselves true championship contenders is as long as it\u2019s been in recent seasons, and perhaps ever, which is the real treat for everyone. With that in mind, here are just some of the must-watch dates we have circled on the NBA calendar (and further study will certainly provide more). (Note: The games are listed in no particular order and each is followed by an explanation as to why it made the list): Oct. 22 New Orleans Pelicans vs. Toronto Raptors (8 p.m. ET, TNT) Los Angeles Lakers vs. LA Clippers (10:30 p.m. ET, TNT) Why we\u2019re tuning in: How could you do anything else on opening night? We get our first glimpse at No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson and the revamped Pelicans traveling north of the border on ring and banner night for Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and the reigning champion Raptors. Then we get to top it off with the first taste of the battle for L.A. between the Staples Center roomies expected to pace the Western Conference this season. The Clippers are technically the home team, but we\u2019ll see if it feels like a Clippers or Lakers building that night. The best part is we don\u2019t have to wait to see how LeBron James and Anthony Davis match up against Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Dec. 11 LA Clippers vs. Toronto Raptors (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) Why we\u2019re tuning in: What do you get the man who delivered it all in his one season in Toronto in his first trip back with his new crew? Knowing what we do of Raptors fans, it\u2019ll be a raucous standing ovation as they pay their respects to Leonard before trying to take the Clippers apart (as Fred Van Vleet promised when asked what they\u2019d do if Kawhi left in free agency). You don\u2019t wait as long as the Raptors did for that championship parade and let Kawhi\u2019s decision to go home spoil the moment. In the end, everyone got what they wanted out of that short-term fling. This night will provide the closure that will allow Raptors fans to move on. Nov. 27 Brooklyn Nets vs. Boston Celtics (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) Los Angeles Lakers vs. New Orleans Pelicans (9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) Why we\u2019re tuning in: Nobody does big-stage drama better than Kyrie Irving, whose first trip back to Boston against his old teammates without Kevin Durant in uniform will be a show-and-prove night for all involved. Irving is carrying the Nets on his shoulders until Durant returns. The Celtics\u2019 youngsters will be eager to show him that they\u2019re better off with Kemba Walker in his place anyway. The fact that these are division rivals who could be battling for playoff positioning all season won\u2019t even be a factor on this night. This is sure to be a good old fashioned grudge match. On the same night Irving goes back to boos in Boston, Davis will face something similar in the Big Easy. Pelicans fans didn\u2019t hide their disdain for Davis once they learned of his trade request last season. His departure for the Lakers, even with all the Pelicans got in return, won\u2019t be enough to soften the mood upon his return to the city he called home for the first seven season of his career. The former Lakers shipped out to acquire Davis \u2014 Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart \u2014 will surely get up for this game as well. Dec. 22 LA Clippers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder (7 p.m. ET, NBA TV) Why we\u2019re tuning in: George\u2019s trade request to the Clippers, is still a tough pill for Thunder fans to swallow. It hastened Russell Westbrook\u2019s departure and the franchise reboot that\u2019s to come. But George will be greeted by Chris Paul, taking on one of his former teams as well, and a Thunder group that will use every slight, real and imagined, to fuel their fire this season. Jan. 9 Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder (9:30 p.m. ET, TNT) Why we\u2019re tuning in: This one could get emotional, for Westbrook and what will certainly be a sellout, standing-room-only crowd that fills the building for his return to his old stomping grounds. Things didn\u2019t end the way anyone envisioned. Westbrook fancied himself a Thunder lifer and an adopted Oklahoman, only to see it all come apart with Leonard\u2019s summer power play with the Clippers. That tribute video the Thunder cook up for Westbrook\u2019s return should be epic. Nov. 7 Boston Celtics vs. Charlotte Hornets (8 ET, p.m. TNT) Why we\u2019re tuning in: Walker was the face of the franchise for years in Charlotte but once again, the free agent frenzy of 2019 showed that indeed nothing lasts forever. He\u2019s sure to receive the hero\u2019s welcome upon returning to the city for the first time in green and white. His replacement, former Celtics point guard Terry Rozier, probably has other plans for how he wants things to go. But it\u2019ll be tough for anyone to spoil the moment for a player who was as beloved as Walker was by fans in the Queen City. Nov. 15 Utah Jazz vs. Memphis Grizzlies (8 p.m. ET, ESPN) Why we\u2019re tuning in: Mike Conley\u2019s tenure in Memphis helped define an era in a basketball-mad region of the country. Folks in the mid-South will be talking about the Grit-and-Grind Grizzlies for years to come and Conley is in line for one of those tear-jerker, team-made tribute videos. But he doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s pity, not with the Jazz team he\u2019ll captain this season. They are primed for a breakout year with Conley and Donovan Mitchell leading the way in one of the league\u2019s most complete backcourts. The Grizzlies, meanwhile, hope they have their next Conley-Marc Gasol duo in place with rookie point guard Ja Morant and second-year big man Jaren Jackson Jr. Oct. 23 Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) Why we\u2019re tuning in: The Celtics and Sixers were both at times last year the hot pick to be kings of the East, only to see the Raptors snatch the mantle in the playoffs. Now we get an early look at both teams, with tweaks, of course (Kemba in place of Kyrie in Boston; Al Horford as the grown up in the room in Philadelphia). Maybe both teams are better prepared to wear the crown as presently constituted \u2026 because they clearly weren\u2019t ready last season. Oct. 24 Milwaukee Bucks vs. Houston Rockets (8 p.m. ET, TNT) LA Clippers vs. Golden State Warriors (10:30 p.m. ET, TNT) Why we\u2019re tuning in: The winners of the last five Kia MVP awards will suit up on this night. In Houston, reigning Kia MVP and Bucks dynamo Giannis Antetokounmpo will attempt to crash the debut of the Rockets\u2019 superstar duo of James Harden ( 2018 MVP ) and Westbrook ( 2017 MVP ). Then we top things off with the Clippers visiting the Warriors for the long-awaited opening of the Chase Center in San Francisco. Two-time former Kia MVP winner Stephen Curry ( 2015 and 2016 ) will attempt to lead the patched-up former champs back to the top of the standings without fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson . We\u2019ll get a full dose of D\u2019Angelo Russell in his Warriors\u2019 debut, though. And we\u2019ll see if the Clippers, who won two games against the Warriors at Oracle Arena in the 2018 playoffs , can make themselves at home in the new spot. Dec. 25 Boston Celtics vs. Toronto Raptors (Noon ET, ESPN) Milwaukee Bucks vs. Philadelphia 76ers (2:30 p.m. ET, ABC) Houston Rockets vs. Golden State Warriors (5 p.m. ET, ABC) LA Clippers vs. Los Angeles Lakers (8 p.m. ET, ESPN\/ABC) New Orleans Pelicans vs. Denver Nuggets (10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) Why we\u2019re tuning in: Five marquee matchups on one day, the biggest and arguably the best single day of showcase games on the schedule, gives us a little bit of everything. Superstars, All-Stars, future stars and contenders from both sides of the conference divide. The Nuggets promise to be one of the most interesting teams to watch this season as we will all see if their No. 2 finish in the West last season was was a preview of more to come \u2026 or something else. The Warriors and Rockets rarely disappoint. The same can be said for the Clippers and Lakers and the Celtics and Raptors in recent seasons. But the Bucks and Sixers might deliver the most intriguing matchup of the day with Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid both looking to settle any lingering questions about who runs the Eastern Conference. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Lowry explained his decision on Instagram, writing: \u201d \u2026 I was hoping to be cleared and ready for the tournament, but I was not cleared for full basketball activities. I was hoping to be available in time to help my country in their quest for the gold this upcoming tournament. I love playing for USAB but I have to sit this one out and support the team from home. At the end of the day, I believe the men that are playing will be great and will win the gold for our country \u2026 GO USAB!!\u201d https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B1FDGoOlBBz\/?igshid ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Lowry has not been cleared to resume playing after having surgery on his right thumb in July. He went to USA Basketball training camp despite a lingering notion he would not be able to play. He played on the U.S. team that won gold in 2016 at the Olympics and remains a hopeful for the 2020 Olympic team, Wojnarowski reports. In the 2016 Olympics, Lowry played in eight games, averaging 5 points, 3.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists. He has been a star for the Raptors over the last seven seasons, earning All-Star appearances in five straight seasons. He averaged 14.2 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 8.7 apg last season and then averaged 15 ppg, 4.9 rpg and 6.6 apg as the Raptors won the NBA championship. Following USA Basketball\u2019s first scrimmage in Las Vegas last weekend, Sacramento Kings big man Marvin Bagley III also withdrew from the team to prepare for the upcoming NBA season. Overall, it has been a chaotic lead up to the FIBA World Cup for Team USA as a parade of players have dropped out of participating for a variety of reasons \u2014 from injury to offseason workload and more. Team USA will start the next leg of its training camp in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The players who will be vying for the 12-man roster are: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, De\u2019Aaron Fox, Joe Harris, Kyle Kuzma, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker and Derrick White. "},{"id":32283,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-schedule-release-earlier-starts-fewer-back-backs","date":"2019-08-12","title":"NBA schedule features earlier tipoffs, fewer back-to-backs","content":" (AP) \u2014 The NBA schedule is a little bit easier on players. Fans might be catching a break \u2014 and some more sleep \u2014 as well. The league announced its 2019-20 schedule on Monday , featuring another dip in back-to-back games for teams and a major change in the number of nationally televised games starting at 10:30 p.m. on the East coast. Golden State and the Los Angeles Lakers will start several games a half-hour earlier than usual, while broadcasters ESPN and Turner are going to earlier start times on many of their midweek doubleheader nights. Such a change has been on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s mind for some time, especially since roughly half of the nation\u2019s television homes are in the East time zone \u2014 but now, a number of the league\u2019s biggest stars play on the West coast. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for nationally televised midweek games to end around 1 a.m. or even later last season, and that was not good for ratings. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think we have to address,\u201d Silver said in May. And changes are definitely coming. ESPN\u2019s Wednesday doubleheaders \u2014 mostly at 8 and 10:30 p.m. last season \u2014 will begin at either 7 or 7:30 p.m., followed by a second game at either 9:30 p.m. or 10 p.m. in the East. TNT had nine Tuesday doubleheaders last season with the second game starting at 10:30; this season that number is down to two, with the second game now mostly starting at 9:30 or 10 p.m. In all, there were 57 games on national television starting at 10:30 p.m. last season. That number falls to 33 this season, a dip of 42 percent. Meanwhile, players might be getting a touch more rest this season as well. For the fifth straight year, the NBA has found a way to lower the average number of times a team has to play on consecutive days. The league average is 12.4 back-to-backs this season, down from 13.3 last year and 36 percent down from the average of 19.3 five years ago. Other highlights from the 2019-20 schedule: OPENING NIGHT Toronto will get its rings on Oct. 22, when it plays host to New Orleans and No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson. The Lakers \u2014 now featuring Anthony Davis to play alongside LeBron James \u2014 will play at the Clippers \u2014 now featuring Kawhi Leonard and Paul George \u2014 in the second half of that doubleheader, and that will be one of the 10:30 p.m. Eastern nationally televised midweek games that will otherwise be largely avoided this season. CHRISTMAS Toronto gets to host a Christmas game for the first time, playing host to Boston at noon Eastern. The other Christmas matchups (all times Eastern): Milwaukee at Philadelphia, 2:30 p.m.; Houston at Golden State, 5 p.m.; Clippers at Lakers, 8 p.m.; New Orleans at Denver, 10:30 p.m. MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY There are 14 games scheduled for Jan. 20, the day honoring the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., including the traditional home games for Atlanta (against Toronto) and Memphis (against New Orleans). EUROPE IN PRIME TIME The schedule features 48 games \u2014 24 on Saturdays, 24 on Sundays \u2014 that will air in prime time in Europe. That doesn\u2019t include the Jan. 24 game in Paris between Milwaukee and Charlotte. FOUR-IN-FIVES The stretches of four games in five days might be gone for good. This will be the third consecutive season where no team gets tasked with handling one of those. No team will play eight games in 12 days, either \u2014 though there are 19 instances of teams having to play five times in a span of seven days. CLOSING NIGHT The regular season ends with 13 games on April 15. Miami, Detroit, Denver and Utah all finish on April 14. The playoffs start April 18."},{"id":32254,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/best-moments-2019-nba-rookie-photoshoot","date":"2019-08-12","title":"Best moments from Panini NBA Rookie Photo Shoot","content":" The 2019 NBA rookie class gathered in New Jersey for the annual Panini NBA Rookie Photo Shoot on Sunday.

After the Senior Team beat the Select Team 97-78 in the scrimmage, two players on the Senior Team were replaced by two players from the Select Team for the next phase of training camp \u2014 three practices and an exhibition game against Spain in Los Angeles. Sent home from the Senior Team were center Bam Adebayo and forward Thaddeus Young. The 22-year-old Adebayo was one of the best rebounders in camp, but was probably a little too raw in comparison to the other bigs. Young, meanwhile, didn\u2019t provide the shooting that the remaining power forwards on the roster do. Added to the roster in their place were Marvin Bagley III and Derrick White, who impressed as members of Jeff Van Gundy\u2019s Select Team. However, after being promoted to the Senior Team, Bagley decided to withdraw from the competition to focus on the upcoming NBA season. White will join the 13 other healthy players from the Senior Team, along with Kyle Lowry (who is recovering from thumb surgery and missed all of this week\u2019s camp) and Marcus Smart (who missed the last three days with a sore left calf). From those 16 players, a 12-man roster will be selected for the World Cup. That roster doesn\u2019t need to be finalized until a two days before the tournament begins on Aug. 31, a fact that USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo has brought up multiple times this week. So he and the rest of the staff clearly won\u2019t rush a final decision and it\u2019s possible that the team will take more than 12 players with it from Los Angeles to Australia, where it will play three more exhibition games before heading to China. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be patient with the rest of the squad, because we have plenty of time,\u201d Colangelo said Friday. \u201cWe want to make sure everyone gets a real shot, and I think the staff is sorting through all that. There\u2019s something we like about every one of the players.\u201d Both Lowry and Smart are likely to make the final roster if they\u2019re healthy, but the status of both is still very much in the air. Lowry is expected to be reevaluated by his doctor before the start of the L.A. camp, and Smart will see how he feels after a few days off. Other sure things to make the final roster are Jayson Tatum (Friday\u2019s leading scorer) and four of the five starters from the scrimmage: Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown and Khris Middleton, though Senior Team head coach Gregg Popovich said afterward that inferring too much into the starting lineup would be \u201can incorrect assumption.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure out how people fit together,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t always necessarily play your most talented guys together. It\u2019s got to be a good mix. You got to have something coming off the bench also. What we\u2019re doing now is just mixing and matching and taking a look at everybody.\u201d The status of guards De\u2019Aaron Fox (who had 12 points and three steals on Friday), Joe Harris and White could depend on the health of Lowry and Smart. The frontline may have more questions than answers. Harrison Barnes is a pretty safe bet to make the roster, maybe leaving one roster spot between Kyle Kuzma and P.J. Tucker. The competition at center features Brook Lopez, Mason Plumlee and Myles Turner, who was the Senior Team\u2019s starting center on Friday. \u201cThere are going to be some players that are more talented than others, but a lot of jobs have to be filled,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re looking for people who are committed defensively and are totally unselfish and are willing to move the ball and move themselves at the offensive end.\u201d With the Senior Team scoring just once on is first six possessions and with the Select Team bigs feasting inside, the young guys jumped out to an 8-2 lead on Friday. But the Senior Team got some stops and the second unit \u2014 Fox, Harris, Tatum, Kuzma and Lopez \u2014 took the lead for good with a 9-0 run to close the first quarter. The Select Team scored just 28 points over the second and third periods and it was a 30-point game going into the fourth. Credit the Senior Team defense (which mixed in some 2-3 zone), though it should be noted that the Select Team was lacking shooters (it finished 3-for-26 from 3-point range) and running plays that they\u2019d seen all week. Tatum was the offensive star, scoring a game-high 17 points on 6-for-8 shooting in just 15:44 off the bench. His biggest highlight on Friday was a late-third-quarter spin move to a left-handed scoop in traffic. But he has shot well most of the week, looking to be in midseason form despite not having played an NBA game in almost three months. \u201cI just tried to come in the best shape as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI just tried to get in a rhythm before I got out here.\u201d Though Popovich was quick to dismiss Friday\u2019s starting lineup as non-news, it\u2019s easy to see Tatum staying in that sixth man role, where he could provide some scoring punch off the bench. \u201cHe was very aggressive tonight,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe really like that about him and need that from him.\u201d A foundation has been set. But there\u2019s still a long way to go before this team is ready for real competition. Developing chemistry, so that the talent can really flourish within the system, takes time. \u201cEverybody here is really talented and has a high IQ,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cWe all know how to play basketball. We did a lot of great things on the fly today, but it\u2019s going to get better with time.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He got right to the point. \u201cWe look forward to going out to China, representing the USA, and winning the gold,\u201d Mitchell said. And now, the first step of getting ready for an unprecedented third straight Basketball World Cup title is complete. USA Basketball held its Blue-White game to wrap up a week of training camp in Las Vegas, and the Blue squad \u2014 the national team candidates, for the most part \u2014 had little trouble in beating the White squad composed mostly of young up-and-coming NBA players, 97-78. Jayson Tatum scored 17 points for the Blue, which got 14 from Kemba Walker and 12 from De\u2019Aaron Fox. Everybody who was supposed to play did, new U.S. coach Gregg Popovich got to tinker with a lot of combinations and no one got seriously hurt \u2014 thankfully, there was no reprise of the scene like the one five years ago during a USA Basketball exhibition game in Las Vegas, when Paul George suffered a horrible lower leg injury. In short, that made the night a success. Everything else was just details. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning, a new tournament, another World Cup and I think our guys are making progress,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t played together before. Showing great effort, doing a good job in a lot of different ways, just trying to get used to each other and form a team. We\u2019re still in those early stages of trying to get together, figure out how we want to play and learn about each other.\u201d Next up: Week 2 of camp, starting Tuesday at the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 practice facility in El Segundo, California. Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo and Chicago\u2019s Thaddeus Young were cut from the national team Friday night, with Derrick White and Marvin Bagley III moving up from the White squad for next week\u2019s camp. Those moves leave the list of candidates for the 12-man national team at 17, counting injured players Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart \u2013 both of whom remain in the mix. \u201cI keep saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to be OK,'\u201d USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d White \u2014 who plays for Popovich in San Antonio, and was getting coached up by him a bit during Friday\u2019s scrimmage as well \u2014 finished with 12 points and seven assists for the White team, coached by Jeff Van Gundy. John Collins also scored 12 and Jonathan Isaac added 11 points for the White squad. Popovich and his staff will have about two more weeks to figure out which 12 players will be in China on the World Cup roster. The tournament starts Aug. 31 and the Americans open group play on Sept. 1 against the Czech Republic in Shanghai. Popovich started Mitchell, Walker, Jaylen Brown, Myles Turner and Khris Middleton, though he cautioned about reading much into that. The next five into the game was Tatum, Fox, Brook Lopez, Joe Harris and Kyle Kuzma. From there, Harrison Barnes, P.J. Tucker, Mason Plumlee, Adebayo and Young eventually got worked in. \u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent on the staff to figure out the best combinations as far as roles are concerned,\u201d Popovich said. The Blue led by as many as 30. Lowry, the point guard for the NBA champion Toronto Raptors told NBA TV during the game that he will meet with his surgeon, Dr. Michelle Carlson from the Hospital for Special Surgery, on Monday \u2014 at which time he may know when he can return to action. Lowry, who had surgery last month to repair a torn tendon in his left thumb, is hoping to participate in national team workouts next week. \u201cHopefully she gives me some good news,\u201d Lowry said. He\u2019s been in a splint for about four weeks. Former USA Basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski and his wife Mickie were courtside. Krzyzewski led the Americans to an 88-1 record and five gold medals \u2014 three Olympics, two World Cups \u2013 in his 12 years at the helm before being succeeded by Popovich for this Olympic cycle. Also in attendance was Vegas regular Floyd Mayweather, a big basketball fan, along with U.S. Olympic basketball gold medalists Sam Perkins and Chris Mullin. After practices next week, the U.S. will play Spain in an exhibition at Anaheim, California on Aug. 16 before flying to Australia the next day.

On Aug. 22, Cousy will visit the White House to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump. It ranks with the Congressional Gold Medal as the highest civilian award and typically is bestowed for \u201cmeritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\u201d Honored recipients are chosen from across all fields, from business and economics, politics and academia to religion, the arts, science, philosophy and medicine. Cousy will become the 33rd recipient from the sports world. What the legendary Boston Celtics guard is most proud of, in receiving the medal, is that it recognizes contributions outside of his athletic career. Cousy\u2019s Celtics\u2019 career was remarkable \u2014 six NBA championships in seven years from 1957-62, 13 All-Star selections in 13 seasons, a first-ballot selection to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and acclaim as the both the league\u2019s prototypical point guard and a major gate attraction with his clever, behind-the-back passing and peripheral court vision. > NBA History:   A closer look at Cousy\u2019s career But the 6-foot-1 guard from Holy Cross was the spark behind the formation and acceptance of the National Basketball Players Association, the union that has made partners of NBA team owners and players while generating the top salaries in major U.S. sports. He also helped to usher black teammates \u2014 including pioneer Chuck Cooper, Bill Russell, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones and Satch Sanders \u2014 as well as the Boston team, the league and their fans through racial integration in the 1950s and \u201860s as America\u2019s civil rights lights were blinking on. Cousy spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner about his upcoming White House visit, as well as his illustrious career. Here is part of that conversation. (For more on Cousy\u2019s remarkable career, check out 10 Things To Know . * * * Steve Aschburner: Congratulations on the honor and your upcoming trip to the White House. What do you make of it, being chosen to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and why is it happening now? Bob Cousy: The story is, three or four good friends came to me about four years ago and asked if I was prepared to perhaps be a recipient, and did I want them to pursue it? I told them I really had never pursued that type of acknowledgement before. But I also didn\u2019t tell them \u201cNo.\u201d So they went out with their plan. Congressman Jim McGovern [D-Mass.] agreed to help them. They put a portfolio together. We thought we had a pretty strong case to make to President Obama. We had a letter that President Kennedy had written to me. We got letters from [former Massachusetts governor] Deval Patrick and [Senator] Cory Booker [D-N.J.], but at the end of the day it didn\u2019t happen. I became involved and reached out to a friend of mine \u2014 who is Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s [D-WVa.] closest friend, I guess \u2014 and he reached out to Joe. And Joe is an honest politician who follows his conscience. SA: Oh, he\u2019s the one \u2026 BC: He\u2019s a Democrat who doesn\u2019t rely on a particular ideology or party affiliation to make decisions. He makes them on their merits. I\u2019ve tried to do the same thing my entire life. My wife and I were registered independents for 63 years for that reason. We didn\u2019t want to get locked into ideology, where everything that came up you just voted the same way. That\u2019s what Joe does. Anyway, Joe had an opportunity to help me. The President [Trump] reaches out to Joe from time to time. SA: And it worked? BC: The President called me last Dec. 3, with he and Joe having lunch together at the White House. Joe had given him my portfolio and, despite the fact it was kind of Democratically tinged, he obviously thought it had merit and he offered me the medal to be given in April. I obviously accepted \u2014 we had a nice 15-minute dialogue \u2014 and I did say, \u2018Mr. President, I am flattered by you calling personally. But I told Joe a year ago I\u2019d refuse to accept this award posthumously.\u2019 He laughed at that and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do it again in April and you\u2019re the first one I\u2019m inviting.\u201d He said, \u201cSo can you stay alive till April.\u201d I told him I\u2019d give it my best shot. SA: But it didn\u2019t happen in April, did it? BC: A guy named Tiger did something spectacular [Tiger Woods won the Masters golf tournament with a stirring comeback performance]. So the President delayed my presentation because he wanted to do Tiger immediately. Shortly after that, his aide contacted me and said, \u201cOK, the President would like to make it on July 29.\u201d I said, \u201cOooh, that\u2019s only two weeks away. Do we have a Plan B?\u201d She said, \u201cSure. How \u2018bout August 22.\u201d I said \u201cBingo! I\u2019ll be there with bells on.\u201d SA: Will you be honored with other recipients? BC: No. He\u2019s the first President \u2014 my ace son-in-law investigated this back to [former President Harry] Truman, and it\u2019s always been done in one ceremony once a year in November. It usually focuses on the arts, but they throw in a few jocks. President Trump is the first one that has decided, instead of one ceremony, he is going to stagger \u2018em. He did, I think, [auto racing giant] Roger Penske in June and [economist] Art Laffer in July, and then I\u2019m up for August. He told me he liked doing it so he didn\u2019t want to do them all together. I was told I\u2019ll be the only recipient on August 22 in the Oval Office. SA: How exciting is this for you and your loved ones? BC: I\u2019ve had my moment in the sun. I\u2019m the Howard Hughes of the sports world. I\u2019ve done like four appearances in 10 years. I hide pretty well from the media. I\u2019ve taken this occasion to do a few interviews because this came out of the blue, and it\u2019s very meaningful coming at this age. It\u2019s a completion of a life\u2019s circle for me, and it\u2019s not necessarily related to sports. As he told me when he called, he was reading the portfolio and focused on things I\u2019d done in terms of social justice and other things. SA: Doesn\u2019t ever get boring, eh, being honored at the White House? BC: I\u2019ve been spoiled. I\u2019ve been to the White House. I\u2019ve been invited six times. I went first in \u201954 when President [Dwight] Eisenhower. Then President [John] Kennedy in \u201963. Then I got the Big Brother of the Year award that was presented by President [Lyndon] Johnson in \u201965. It was nice because he had received it in \u201964. I was heavily involved and still am in Big Brothers. And I went back the next year when they gave the same award to Billy Graham. That was nice, I brought my daughters.  Then I had a small exhibit in the Smithsonian, and President [Ronald] Reagan had a Smithsonian night at the White House. Everyone who had some sort of connection went to that. SA: That\u2019s an impressive \u2014 BC: Wait, let me correct that. President [Richard] Nixon in \u201973 invited us. Believe it or not, we didn\u2019t go to that one. I was coaching a team that beat the Russians, who had beaten us in \u201972 in the Olympics for the first time. The AAU brought a team back, they asked me to coach it, and we beat them four out of six, I think. It got a lot of attention, and President Nixon invited us. It wasn\u2019t a popular thing with the players, though, so I called a team meeting. I said, \u2018Guys, you\u2019re the ones doing all the work here. Am I misreading this or are you not thrilled with going to the White House? If that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s have a show of hands.\u2019 They were mad at Nixon for Vietnam. I didn\u2019t go into the politics of it, I just called the AAU guy in and said, \u201cPlease thank the President profusely. Make whatever apologies you want.\u201d So this is my seventh invitation and, for a lot of reasons, the most exciting. SA: So you and your team were ahead of your time 46 years ago. We have seen instances of sports people or teams turning down White House invitations from the current administration. Did you consider that? BC: Oh no. As I told you, my wife and I were registered independents. To be honest, I didn\u2019t vote for the President. I also didn\u2019t vote for Hillary [Clinton]. I voted for the guy who didn\u2019t know where Aleppo was. [Libertarian POTUS candidate Gary Johnson, in a November 2016 TV interview , couldn\u2019t answer a question about the city at the center of Syrian\u2019s civil war.] However, given this situation, this President will definitely have my vote in 2020. I simply feel, without getting into the politics of it at all, like many Americans \u2014 I agree with some of the things he\u2019s done and disagree with others. SA: From what we see and hear on social and traditional media, there are very few of your type, in the middle. BC: [Laughs] I\u2019m certainly not radicalized at all. I\u2019m upset as most moderates are, I\u2019ve never seen in my 90 years this type of polarization and this vitriolic language that\u2019s being used to oppose anybody. Doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Donald Trump or anyone, I\u2019m just amazed it\u2019s become so passionate and it\u2019s dividing us as a country. I\u2019m upset about that. I\u2019ve never seen it this bad. But obviously, I\u2019m going to the White House with my family and some close friends, and trying not to make it political in any way. I\u2019m just very pleased to be chosen at this point in my life. SA: Now you and Bill Russell, who received the award in 2011, are legendary teammates who have won this award? BC: There are only two teams in American sports. The Yankees, with Babe Ruth and Yogi Berra. And Russ and I now with the Celtics. For whatever that\u2019s worth to the two teams involved. I hope it\u2019s meaningful to them as well. SA: You witnessed so much of what Russell went through as a proud black athlete during an era when the civil rights battles were beginning. Some of what you have talked about in the past \u2014 intruders breaking into the Russells\u2019 home while they were gone, vandalizing it and defecating in the bed \u2014 was inhuman. What do you make of race relations in the U.S. some 50 or 60 years later? BC: I was saying to someone recently, despite the frenetic and passionate rhetoric on both sides \u2014 and I feel that it is divisive \u2014 I am pleased that we\u2019re having this discussion. Because whether we want to admit it or not \u2014 it\u2019s not that we\u2019re a racist country, I don\u2019t think we are \u2014 but racism exists. We\u2019ve let it sit there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve addressed it, certainly not as effectively as we could have. This narrative we\u2019re having now, I see it as perhaps as helping to focus attention on it. For a lot of moderates like myself and those in a position to be helpful, this is helping us to pay attention to it. And maybe something productive and good will come out of that. That\u2019s my hope. SA: Seems like so much time and energy get drained by people yelling at each other, doesn\u2019t it? BC: But if you\u2019ll notice, we\u2019re integrating African-Americans more and more into our culture, certainly in the arts. On television, every other TV ad I see has African-American participation, sometimes completely so, and this is good in my judgment. I\u2019ve traveled all over the world and when you walk the street, you see people of all colors, all ethnicities. After awhile, you don\u2019t even pay attention to it because it\u2019s normal. And what I just cited, this is how you normalize it. Hopefully, eventually, we\u2019ll have the same reaction. We won\u2019t notice who\u2019s white, who\u2019s a tinge of another color. That\u2019s the way it should be. SA: You\u2019ve said you regret not speaking out on Russell\u2019s behalf more when you were teammates [1956-63] and wish you\u2019d had more meaningful conversations with him on race. That\u2019s noted in Gary M. Pomerantz\u2019s book, \u201cThe Last Pass\u201d about the two of you. But Russell was sometimes criticized for being aloof and angry. He is very prideful and did not suffer fools gladly. How did you see it? BC: Russell\u2019s a very sensitive black man who resented any type of racism he endured. He decided to fight the battle in his way. I would not judge. You know, athletes are competitive, and it\u2019s very hard for us to turn the other cheek. And he never did. He made outrageous statements when he had a podium. \u201cBoston is the most racist city in the world,\u201d and things like that. He was trying to get the attention of the majority. That, in his judgment, was his way to fight the good fight. Whether I agreed with that or not. SA: You saw other ways to make the case? BC: I will tell you I had great respect for Arthur Ashe. I remember dropping him a note or two, in terms of how he fought it. He fought it in a different way, without becoming an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d but also without pissing off the moderates. He reached out and tried to do it, I guess, the way Dr. [Martin Luther] King did it: With love. As opposed to Russ\u2019 approach. You\u2019ve got to follow your instincts in something like that. I had great respect for Arthur Ashe in how he fought the battle. But I would never criticize Russ for how his instincts told him he had to fight his battle. SA: What are your thoughts on the NBA, which is considered the most progressive of the major sports leagues? BC: One of the things that makes me the most proud is, I started the NBA players association in 1955. In those days, there were only six franchises, then we went to eight and 10. You had to plead with people to come in, you\u2019d give away tickets. Fast-forward 50 or 60 years, and the last time I looked, they sold a franchise in L.A. for $2.1 billion. That\u2019s with a \u201cb.\u201d That\u2019s how far a league has come that we set the table for in the 1950s. I\u2019m proud that I played a role. SA: What was the key to making that work? BC: Part of it was the NBA Board of Governors living harmoniously with the NBA Players Association. In terms of what we just spoke about \u2014 the radicalization of politics in this country and the division that\u2019s involved \u2014 that was just the opposite. The reason the NBA has reached the levels they\u2019ve reached in this period of time is, the commissioners maybe weren\u2019t kissy-poo \u2014 I\u2019m sure there were harsh words \u2014 but in the end the player and the NBA governors worked together toward their common good. And the good of everyone involved. SA: So no resentment or envy of today\u2019s players and the salaries they command? BC: [Laughs] I used to say when I spoke, \u201cI was the highest paid player in the league in 1963, I made $35,000. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d Forty years later, a guy named Michael was the best guard in the league and made $35 million. And last year, LeBron made $40 million for one year. So I am pleased I made a small role in setting the table for this kind of organization. Now people like Adam Silver, and David Stern before him, continue this legacy, I think, of working harmoniously with the \u201cother side\u201d if you want to call them that. Seems to me they\u2019ve all worked together to create this NBA entity we\u2019re all proud of. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

For the scrimmage, the Blue Team will be the 15 healthy players on the Senior Team Roster (with Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart injured), while the White Team will be the 11 remaining players on the Select Team roster (with Trae Young having left camp with his own injury). In training camps of years past, Senior Team guys have been split up for the final-night scrimmage. Doing that again would allow for more playing time for everyone, but the Senior Team and Select Team (coached by Jeff Van Gundy) have been operating separately all week and not running the same stuff. This is the last chance for guys (on either team) to earn a trip to Los Angeles for the next phase of training camp, which begins Tuesday night. And for that, it should be a pretty competitive game. \u201cThe thing that I love is our intensity in practice,\u201d Kemba Walker said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting after it, every possession, every drill. The communication level is so high.\u201d The Senior Team lineups and playing-time distribution will be very interesting. The plan (which could change) is to announce the trimmed down roster for the L.A. camp on Saturday morning. That roster will likely have at least 15 names on it, but the roster math goes beyond the 15 Senior Team guys who are healthy, and there will surely be some cuts. Here are some thoughts and questions regarding the roster\u2026 The closest thing to a certainty with this roster is that the starting backcourt will be Walker and Donovan Mitchell. The two have played together quite a bit in camp, Mitchell has looked like a budding star, and it\u2019s fair to say that Walker has enjoyed the partnership. \u201cI love playing with that kid,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a competitor. He\u2019s so intense. He reminds me of myself a lot. I love it. It\u2019s going to be fun playing with him.\u201d And in regard to Mitchell\u2019s ability to play the two, Walker has no doubts. \u201cEasily,\u201d Walker answered. \u201cThat kid is so talented, and he wants it. That\u2019s what I love the most.\u201d The status of Lowry (recovering from thumb surgery) and Smart (sore left calf) hang over this whole process. We\u2019ll know more about both of them next week, but in deciding who\u2019s going to L.A., the USA staff has to plan for the possibility that neither will be on the World Cup roster. Lowry is obviously the more doubtful of the two. Other players (whose NBA seasons finished a lot earlier than June 13) have backed out for reasons far less severe than thumb surgery. So give the NBA champ (and 2016 Olympic gold medalist) a ton of credit for just being here. And even if he isn\u2019t on the World Cup roster, Lowry\u2019s presence and clear desire to play will surely earn him some equity in regard to the selection of next year\u2019s Olympic team. De\u2019Aaron Fox and Joe Harris were promoted from the Select Team to the Senior Team before camp even started. Could another player or two leap-frog some Senior Team players and earn an invite to L.A.? Based on impressions from the last three days, Derrick White would be the No. 1 candidate. White would still be behind Walker, Mitchell and (probably) Lowry\/Fox in the ball-handler\u2019s depth chart, but with Trae Young (eye infection) not playing on Friday, White will have a better opportunity to shine than some guys on the Senior Team. Jalen Brunson is the only other healthy ball-handler on the Select Team. Marvin Bagley III has also drawn a lot of praise in camp, and the depth chart on the Senior Team frontline appears to be wide open. The Select Team roster is big-heavy and Bagley will be sharing playing time with Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Mitchell Robinson on Friday. But if USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo and Senior Team coach Gregg Popovich want to get another good look at Bagley, Van Gundy will surely oblige. Both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are pretty safe bets to make the final roster, and there\u2019s a chance they could be the starting forwards. Tatum shot very well in the controlled scrimmage that the media watched on Thursday, and Brown is arguably the most versatile forward in camp. Kyle Kuzma offers similar versatility, and it will be interesting to see where he stands in the rotation on Friday. Khris Middleton is one of only three 2019 All-Stars on the 17-man roster, but hasn\u2019t stood out in scrimmages. Joe Harris, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been the best shooter. Middleton should get by on his resume, but there may be some pressure on Harris in Friday\u2019s scrimmage. \u201cObviously, you hope to make shots,\u201d Harris said Thursday. \u201cBut you can\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself to make it, because whether or not they go in, you\u2019re creating space everybody else. That\u2019s what you want, especially in settings like this, where everybody\u2019s got a tendency to pack in [defensively] so much. If you\u2019ve got one guy that can create just a little bit of space for somebody that can get downhill, it opens up everything offensively.\u201d For a few minutes of Thursday\u2019s controlled scrimmage, we saw a two-center frontcourt of Myles Turner and Brook Lopez. And we also saw a couple of no-center frontcourts: Harrison Barnes with P.J. Tucker and Kuzma with Thaddeus Young. Barnes and Young would seemingly be in direct competition for a roster spot. For now, give Barnes the edge because of his experience with the 2016 Olympic team and his superior 3-point shooting. \u201cYou got to have enough shooters,\u201d Colangelo said earlier this week, \u201cso guys that can shoot the ball have a little bit of an edge, all [other] things being equal.\u201d If the roster includes four guards (Walker, Mitchell and two of the following group: Fox, Harris, Lowry, Smart and White), they have eight roster spots left. If four of those are 3\/4 guys (Brown, Kuzma, Middleton and Tatum), they have four spots for bigger forwards and centers. Would they take Barnes (or Young), Tucker and two centers? Would they remove Kuzma from the 3\/4 group and add a third center? Three centers seems like a lot, but some of the best teams at the world cup have NBA talent up front: Nikola Jokic for Serbia, Marc Gasol for Spain, Rudy Gobert for France, Andrew Bogut and Aron Baynes for Australia, and Domantas Sabonis and Jonas Valanciunas for Lithuania. In that regard, a question that could come up in staff deliberations: Is there a player that they would want for one specific matchup? For instance, while Lopez and Turner are superior rim protectors and offensive players, neither would necessarily be the best option to defend Jokic in a matchup against Serbia (arguably the second best team in the tournament). According to Second Spectrum matchup data , Jokic scored at a higher rate than usual when defended by both of those guys last season, shooting 31-for-58 (53 percent) on 197 total possessions against the two. Might the best option in a Jokic matchup be his own teammate? Mason Plumlee doesn\u2019t offer much offensively, but he\u2019s a player that coaches can trust, he\u2019s more mobile defensively than either Lopez or Turner, and he obviously knows Jokic well. Along those same lines, is there a player on this roster who\u2019s best suited to defend Giannis Antetokounmpo? Tucker had some success in that regard last season, holding the MVP to just 20 points on 98 possessions as his primary defender. In fact, among the 16 players who defended Antetokounmpo for at least 60 possessions last season, Tucker is the one who held him furthest below his regular scoring rate . (Jabari Parker was next on the list, so hey, let\u2019s not take that data for gospel.) The U.S. will likely play Greece in the second round of pool play (before the single-elimination tournament). There will be three players in the World Cup who received MVP votes last season, and none of the three will be playing for the United States. ( Rudy Gobert is the third .)"},{"id":32260,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rosters-announced-usa-exhibition-game","date":"2019-08-09","title":"Rosters Announced for USA Exhibition Game","content":" LAS VEGAS (Aug. 9, 2019) \u2013 USA Basketball today announced the rosters for the Aug. 9 USA White versus USA Blue exhibition game that will be played at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

They\u2019re a whole lot closer now. USA Basketball\u2019s coaching past was alongside its present Wednesday, when Krzyzewski \u2014 who led the national team to an 88-1 record over his 12 years at the helm \u2014 was alongside Popovich for Day 3 of the team\u2019s training camp in advance of the FIBA World Cup. And Popovich made no effort to hide how happy he was to have his predecessor in the gym to watch practice and some scrimmages. \u201cWe were anxious to get Coach K in town to spend a couple days,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to him, as you might imagine, gotten advice. But to have him here, seeing the scrimmage, now we can all go back and talk about what we think needs to happen. Having him here with that added experience is invaluable.\u201d Popovich wasn\u2019t the only one in the gym feeling a boost from Krzyzewski\u2019s presence on Wednesday. Among the others: USA Basketball forwards Mason Plumlee and Jayson Tatum, both of whom said they relished the chance to spend some extra time with their coach from Duke. \u201cIt was great, man,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cI try to see Coach once or twice a summer, so for him to come out here \u2026 he didn\u2019t come for me, but it was great to see him.\u201d Tatum chatted with Krzyzewski for a few minutes after practice, and said he got some advice. \u201cConfidential,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cBut it was good advice.\u201d Krzyzewski won five gold medals in his tenure as national team coach \u2014 including three at the Olympics and two from the world championships, now known as the World Cup \u2014 started Wednesday in a morning meeting with Popovich and other coaches. He walked into practice at UNLV alongside Popovich and was expected to take part in more meetings before departing later this week. \u201cHe\u2019s really the only guy that Pop can relate to in trying to bring this together so fast,\u201d Plumlee said. Krzyzewski, who politely declined an interview request through USA Basketball, first met Popovich around the time that the longtime San Antonio Spurs coach was accepting an invitation to replace the Duke coach at the helm of the U.S. program. They were brought together in Las Vegas by USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo during preparations for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Colangelo wanted to hire Krzyzewski\u2019s replacement long before Rio, just to eliminate incessant speculation during the Olympic cycle about who would take over the program. He wasn\u2019t aware at the time that the coaches had never gotten acquainted. \u201cOnce they got to know each other, they were like bonded immediately,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cPop was in all the meetings and the practices after they met. I wanted him to get his feet wet just to see how we had done things under Mike. And I think it was a great way to get him started. But I thought that was amazing, that they had never met each other.\u201d Krzyzewski and Popovich are loaded with similarities: Both went to service academies, both played for Bob Knight (Krzyzewski played for Knight at Army, and Knight was Popovich\u2019s coach at the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials, a few years before Popovich got his first head coaching job at Division III Pomona-Pitzer). Both have five championships from their \u2018real\u2019 jobs \u2014 Krzyzewski at Duke, Popovich in San Antonio. They are both considered basketball royalty, the top of the top of their profession. All that only adds to the oddity that they didn\u2019t know each other until a few years ago. \u201cI\u2019m a Division III guy at heart and that\u2019s where I spent most of my time until I somehow woke up in San Antonio and never left,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe never played Duke when I was at Pomona-Pitzer.\u201d"},{"id":32273,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/team-usa-notebook-playing-small-roster-decisions","date":"2019-08-08","title":"In playing small, big decisions loom for Team USA","content":" LAS VEGAS \u2014 Day 3 of training camp for the US men\u2019s senior national team brought more scrimmaging against the Select Team. And the media was able to see more of it than on Tuesday. Both of the quarters that the media witnessed ended in ties. At the end of the first of those two, Khris Middleton got Jonathan Isaac to bite on a pump fake and then made three free throws with 0.7 seconds on the clock to tie it at 23. And with the score tied 24-24 at the end of the last 10-minute scrimmage, Derrick White missed a pull-up 3 that would have given the Select Team the win. The Senior Team had a solid lead midway through that last period, but they lost it when coach Steve Kerr went small with a lineup of De\u2019Aaron Fox, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Middleton and Kyle Kuzma. The Select Team, playing with a frontline of Jonathan Isaac, Marvin Bagley Jr. and Mitchell Robinson for the last few minutes, scored too easily inside against the smaller Senior lineup. Kuzma said afterward that he wasn\u2019t surprised when Middleton checked in for one of the Senior Team centers and told Kuzma that he was now playing the 5 and guarding Jarrett Allen (before Robinson checked in). \u201c[Coach Gregg Popovich] and the rest of staff said that they like my defensive versatility, how I can guard multiple positions,\u201d he explained. \u201cWith the Euro game, there\u2019s not too many people posting up. So, it\u2019s going to bring guys out who have to guard me. That will open penetration for our elite guards.\u201d Even better today. #USABMNT training camp scenes from day three \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com\/pumT8PFq4d \u2014 USA Basketball (@usabasketball) August 7, 2019 Kerr, meanwhile, made it clear that experimenting with the small lineup was just part of the process. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at different players at different positions to see how they fit. [Playing small] is something that we will definitely consider, but it\u2019s Day 3 of training camp. Who knows if it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to do?\u201d Previous versions of the national team haven\u2019t played small (without a 4 or 5 at \u201ccenter\u201d) very often in international competitions. But it will be interesting to see which centers make the final roster. They\u2019re all very different players. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an offensive guy in [Brook] Lopez,\u201d said US team managing director Jerry Colangelo. \u201cFundamentally, [Mason] Plumlee is excellent in everything he does. Bam [Adebayo] is young. And [Myles] Turner, who was slow to start in the first couple of days, came to life today, I thought.\u201d One observation from the scrimmaging that the media has seen: The bouncy Adebayo seems to rebound everything. Neither team has been able to run much in the scrimmages \u2014 transition defense, FTW \u2014 but Wednesday\u2019s highlight was a fast-break alley-oop from Kemba Walker to Donovan Mitchell. KEMBA to DONOVAN \ud83d\udca5 #USABMNT  pic.twitter.com\/xPX83OYD1C \u2014 NBA (@NBA) August 7, 2019 Brown tried to top that, but he couldn\u2019t finish a dunk attempt over Allen. From what the media has seen, Mitchell has been playing the 2, alongside Walker or Fox. In those last couple of quarters, Mitchell shot well, both off the dribble and off the catch. In fact, in a role-reversal situation, he hit two 3-pointers off of nice drive-and-kick feeds from Joe Harris.  Marcus Smart sat out of practice on Wednesday, dealing with a sore left calf. He\u2019s out for the rest of this week and will be re-evaluated when the team reconvenes in Los Angeles next week. Kyle Lowry, recovering from thumb surgery, is also on the shelf and set to be reevaluated next week. Colangelo said Wednesday that the preliminary plan is to bring 15 players to Los Angeles for three practices and an exhibition game against Spain, but that 15 number is \u201ca moving target\u201d (meaning that it\u2019s not set in stone). It\u2019s safe to assume that two of those 15 (or so) are Lowry and Smart. So we may see two healthy players cut from the roster between Friday\u2019s intrasquad scrimmage and next Tuesday. That will be a difficult process, both in distinguishing a group of players that seem to be on the same level and telling guys that they\u2019re no longer needed. \u201cThey\u2019re all tough decisions, because you have a whole roster full of really good players,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cCutting players is always hard, even in [NBA] training camp every year. We bring in guys for camp who we know aren\u2019t going to make the team, they know they\u2019re not going to make the team, and yet to sit down with them and say, \u2018This is it,\u2019 it\u2019s brutal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do that with a handful of players here, and it\u2019s going to be even more difficult, because they\u2019ve all cut time out of their summers to come here and try to play for their country. Everybody\u2019s excited to be here and wants to be part of it, but we can only take 12. So it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Colangelo said that the staff meets at the hotel after practice and evaluates every player, even those on the Select Team, every day. Colangelo cited Bagley and White as two Select Team players who have stood out over the last couple of days. Bagley shined in the portion of practice that the media saw. He\u2019s big, he\u2019s skilled, and he\u2019s athletic. Trae Young remains a dangerous offensive player (he had one nifty dish off a baseline drive on Wednesday) and a liability defensively. Jalen Brunson seemed to be holding his own. Isaac said afterward that he\u2019s played almost entirely at small forward for the Select Team. Their 12-man roster (coached by Jeff Van Gundy) includes five guys \u2014 Allen, Bagley, John Collins, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Robinson \u2014 that are power forwards or centers. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

So under-the-radar that both Brooklyn Nets coach Kenny Atkinson and GM Sean Marks found out the All-NBA forward was signing with Brooklyn via the same Instagram post that announced the decision to the world. But that doesn\u2019t mean the controversy didn\u2019t swirl. From the moment Durant headed to the locker room after 11 minutes of play, the second-guessing began : Who made the call? Was he fully recovered from the prior injury? Was everyone aware of the risks? In an exclusive interview with Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, Durant quickly squashed all notion of outside liability. He said he made his decision to go to Brooklyn on June 30, the first day in which free agents such as himself could reach agreements with teams (but not officially sign). \u201cI never wanted to disrespect the game by putting my focus on the future,\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports. \u201cIt was always about that day, focusing on that day and what was most important that day. And throughout the season, basketball is the No. 1 thing.\u201d In his interview with Haynes, the discussion turns to Durant\u2019s status for the 2019-20 season. The Nets restocked their roster this summer, signing All-Star guard Kyrie Irving, former All-Star big man DeAndre Jordan and trading for other players, too. However, it is unknown if Durant will suit up before the season ends if at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Durant said when asked by Yahoo Sports about him being expected to miss the season. \u201cJust like I didn\u2019t know I was going to get hurt. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. I\u2019m early in the process. So I\u2019m grinding every day. I\u2019m not even trying to think that far. That\u2019s not going to do me any good. So I just try to focus on what I can control right now, second by second. Who knows? We\u2019ll see. \u201cBut once you get to learn your body a little bit more and you realize what this injury is, you know, it\u2019s going to take a lot of work for me to get back to full strength. I was at a point where mentally and physically, my body and mind had met at the right point and I had reached a level that I never reached before. My mind is still there, now my body just has to catch up. Once that does, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d As he left the court following his injury in Game 5, there was a moment in which some fans at Scotiabank Arena cheered as he was helped off the court. Durant said he doesn\u2019t remember hearing the fans that night, but had a statement for them now. \u201cIt will probably be the last time they will be in the Finals,\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports with a smirk. Overall, Durant says he was driven to play in Game 5 of The Finals and was locked in on doing so, with the timeline being solely his own. \u201cNo matter what the series was, I was aiming for Game 5,\u201d he told Yahoo Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s why I played when it was 3-1. No matter what, I just wanted to play in the Finals. I just wanted to hoop, especially if I could be out there. I was feeling good leading up to it. I was working out every day. I was gradually getting back to myself doing the two-a-days. I was really locked in on my game and trying to get back. I really wanted to play in that series.\u201d Durant went on to discuss the decision to leave Golden State for Brooklyn \u2014 \u201cBecause I wanted to\u201d \u2014 just what he thought of speculation he was headed to the Knicks \u2014 \u201cThat was crazy\u201d \u2014 and how he\u2019s handling his rehabilitation: \u201cMy mind is still there, now my body just has to catch up. Once that does, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Even without Durant\u2019s injury, last season for the Warriors was a particularly challenging one for the Warriors at times. Early in the season, he and teammate Draymond Green had a tiff that led to Green being suspended one game without pay . At the time, it was speculated that incident led to Durant\u2019s decision to move on from Golden State, which Durant squashed in his Yahoo Sports interview. \u201cHell, yeah, I\u2019m tired of talking about that [expletive]. Look, we\u2019re grown men,\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWe understand what this is. We\u2019re playing basketball for a living. It\u2019s a business. Everybody congratulated me when I went to the Nets. Everybody wished me well, and they know that I\u2019m still a phone call away. So, I just happen to play in a different jersey now. Nothing else is going to change.\u201d In all, Durant had nothing but positives to say about his time with Golden State \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to see how he could not. After signing with the Warriors in the surprise free-agent move of 2016, Durant won back-to-back NBA championships and Finals MVPs. \u201cIt was a life-changing experience,\u201d he told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI grew up as a young adult in OKC and then entering my 30s in Golden State was an enlightening experience, getting to play the game and reaching that level with the players of different backgrounds. It was just so much that went into that experience that elevated me mentally, physically and elevated my game. It was a fun time and I appreciate all that we accomplished together.\u201d "},{"id":32350,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/team-usa-notebook-popovich-emphasizing-ball-movement","date":"2019-08-07","title":"Team USA notebook: Select Team joins practice","content":" LAS VEGAS \u2014 Day 2 of training camp for the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team saw the squad\u2019s first action against the Select Team. And the media walked in to see the young guys finish off a 22-6 quarter to close practice. The Select Team actually started practicing on Sunday, so they\u2019ve had an extra day together. Their job is to prepare the Senior Team for how opponents will play them at the World Cup. Only three of the 17 players on the main roster have played FIBA basketball on the senior level. So part of the agenda for this week is getting players used to the rule differences and style of play. The biggest rule difference is the lack of a defensive three-second rule. That could be advantageous for the U.S., with two of the league\u2019s best rim protectors \u2014 Brook Lopez and Myles Turner \u2014 potentially on the roster. But it will also make it tougher to get to the basket on offense than guys are used to. So the Select Team was crowding the paint on Tuesday. The staff has also showed the players film from previous tournaments to emphasize the lack of driving lanes. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much freedom to get down the lane,\u201d Joe Harris said Tuesday. \u201cA lot of teams are going to be overloading and packing it in, and you got to be able to knock down shots.\u201d That obviously helps Harris\u2019 chances of making the World Cup roster, even though the league\u2019s leading 3-point shooter from last season (47.4 percent) wasn\u2019t on the Senior Team roster until Monday. Harrison Barnes (27th at 39.5 percent) is the only other player on the 17-man roster that finished the top 40 in 3-point percentage. New U.S. coach Gregg Popovich wants the ball to move. This team has a \u201cpoint-five-second rule\u201d on offense, where players shouldn\u2019t hold the ball for more than half a second before doing something with it. Every half of a second where the ball is held makes it tougher to get a good shot. (The FIBA shot clock is the same as it is in the NBA \u2014 24 seconds, with a reset to 14 after an offensive rebound.) Mason Plumlee is one of the three guys here who played under coach Mike Krzyzewski for a previous version of the Senior Team. And the emphasis on ball movement is also about the new coach. \u201cCoach K ran a lot of the stuff we ran at Duke,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cPop is definitely San Antonio-style of play where it\u2019s no-hold basketball. You\u2019re moving it.\u201d It\u2019s also about the make-up of the roster, which doesn\u2019t include any of the 15 American players who averaged at least three isolation possessions per game last season . \u201cIn the past,\u201d Barnes explained, \u201cthe one-on-one talent itself has been so potent \u2014 Kobe, LeBron, Durant, Carmelo \u2014 guys can go out there and get a basket. This year, with the experience that other teams are going to have over us, how hard we play is going to have to carry the day.\u201d For Barnes, camp has had a much different feel than when he was preparing for the 2016 Olympics with a very different group. \u201cIn \u201916, I was one of the younger guys on the team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was more of a veteran team. People knew how to play. They had already been through the system and the pipeline. It was more so just make sure you\u2019re in shape, make sure everyone\u2019s healthy, and just go out there and play. \u201cThis time around, it\u2019s much more structured. You can tell that Pop really wants to put his imprint on USA Basketball. With how the young the team is, the teaching is much more the emphasis.\u201d Defense might require a bigger adjustment for some of these players, because they\u2019re used to certain principles with their NBA teams and will have to put those aside to defend (and call out coverages) according to the U.S. Team\u2019s standards. The staff is anticipating a lot of pick-and-rolls from their opponents, and they want to defend those pick-and-rolls with just two defenders. \u201cWe\u2019re doing some different stuff on defense,\u201d Plumlee said, \u201cto try to guard the pick-and-roll with two players and stay home with shooters.\u201d And Popovich hasn\u2019t hesitated to take these NBA vets back to the basics. Both Barnes and Harris mentioned the \u201cshell drill,\u201d used to work on defensive positioning with the movement of the ball. But there hasn\u2019t been too many drills. The first two practices have featured a lot of scrimmaging. On Monday, it was the 16 healthy Senior Team guys split into two eight-player squads, and on Tuesday, the Select Team was brought in. With only 21 days of training before the first World Cup game (vs. the Czech Republic on Sept. 1), there\u2019s not much time to build chemistry between guys who aren\u2019t used to playing alongside one another. \u201cYou can script and walk through stuff,\u201d Plumlee said, \u201cbut playing is the best way to get a feel for your teammates.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all new for everybody,\u201d Khris Middleton added. \u201cThe first thing is to learn the principles. Try to learn each one of these guys out here. In order to accomplish our goal, we got to figure out things quickly and try to get on the same page as soon as we can.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He deleted the post Tuesday morning, when it started making news and after the casino issued a statement saying its security staff routinely did ID checks on anyone who appears younger than 25. The 23-year-old Simmons, who recently became the highest-paid Australian athlete when he signed a five-year, $170 million contract extension with the 76ers, apparently wasn\u2019t recognized by security at one of the casino\u2019s entry points Monday night. But he was allowed in at a second entry point after providing identification. After appearing at a charity event Tuesday, he posted on Twitter to explain his earlier video. \u201cAs you know an incident happened last night at Crown and my friends and I felt personally singled out, no one likes to feel like this,\u201d the Melbourne-born Simmons said in a tweet. \u201cI am very passionate about equality and I will always speak up even if it means having uncomfortable conversations.\u201d The casino issued a statement saying its \u201cinternal security policy requires our security officers to check identification of those persons they believe to be under the age of 25, this is an enhanced safeguard to ensure that no one under the age of 18 is permitted entry to the casino floor as required by law. \u201cThe group subsequently provided identification and were permitted entry \u2026 (we) strenuously reject reports that it discriminated against a group of visitors last night.\u201d Simmons, whose father is African American, did not explain why he deleted the post.

Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said he found out personally this summer that Leonard, who was a free agent, was signing with the LA Clippers rather than staying put. Lowry told reporters at Monday\u2019s first training practice with USA Basketball that he holds no ill will toward his former teammate for moving on from Toronto. His reaction upon hearing Leonard\u2019s decision was as follows, per Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN : \u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI am happy for the guys that \u2026 especially a guy that helped do something fantastic and something great. He\u2019s an unbelievable friend of mine and is a good guy. \u201cHe made a decision to go home and he is happy with that and I am happy for him. Truly. I am genuinely happy for him. It gives him a chance to be around his family and friends. You got to respect the guy and be happy for him.\u201d In addition, Lowry said Leonard\u2019s departure didn\u2019t change the way he felt about Toronto reigning supreme in the NBA. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Lowry said, per ESPN.com . \u201cNot at all. We are champions. No matter what. [It will] never be taken away from us. Ever. Ever, ever. Ever, ever.\u201d In addition to discussing Leonard\u2019s departure, Lowry also spoke about his own future with Toronto as he can become a free agent next summer. Lowry said he wants to remain with the Raptors long term (he has spent seven of his 13 NBA seasons in Toronto) and recently hired Mark Bartelstein as his agent, ESPN reports . \u201cI want to be there \u2014 I would love to do a long [term] extension, but we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Lowry said Monday when asked about staying with the Raptors beyond this season. \u201cI\u2019m here for USA Basketball and support the guys and be around the group. [But] I would love to be there long term, but we\u2019ll have that discussion when the time is right.\u201d Lowry did not participate in the USA\u2019s first practice as he heals up following a procedure to repair a torn tendon in his left thumb. He\u2019s hoping to be cleared to practice when the team reconvenes in Los Angeles from Aug. 13-16 for three more days of practice and an exhibition game against Spain. But right now, it\u2019s not guaranteed that he\u2019ll be able to play. In Raptors lore, Lowry ranks as the team\u2019s all-time leader in regular season 3-pointers made, 3-pointers attempted and steals while also ranking in the Top 5 in several other categories including games played, points scored, assists, free throws and more. In terms of playoff history , Lowry leads the Raptors in games played, points, assists, steals, field goals and 3-pointers. Last season, Lowry made his fifth straight All-Star appearance and averaged 142 points, 4.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 1.4 steals per game. He made the All-NBA third team in the 2015-16 season."},{"id":32341,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/questions-abound-team-usa-opens-training-camp","date":"2019-08-06","title":"Plenty of questions, few answers as Team USA opens training camp","content":" LAS VEGAS \u2014 The U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team tipped off training camp on Monday. This was the start of a six-week process that they hope ends with the gold medal game of the FIBA World Cup in Beijing on Sept. 15. This week includes four days of practice, followed by an intrasquad scrimmage on Friday ( 10 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). Before we get into the next six weeks, let\u2019s review how we got to Monday with a much different pool of players than national team managing director Jerry Colangelo originally anticipated. * * *    Going back to who\u2019s not here: There are 33 players \u2014 30 from the 2018-20 roster and three that signed up and backed out this year \u2014 who have decided not to play. That\u2019s almost three full rosters of American players, and it doesn\u2019t include any guys that were offered a spot, but declined before being named to the roster. J.J. Redick is a player that reportedly declined an invite. They can\u2019t all be lumped into one group of guys who just don\u2019t want to make the six-week commitment. Some have family business to tend to. But one reason cited by multiple players who have backed out is preparing for next season. And in that regard, the World Cup schedule , along with the travel, is not ideal. The gold medal game is Sept. 15. So players will be returning from China (on a flight of 15 hours or so) on Sept. 16. The start of NBA training camps has been pushed back one week this year, but national team players will have less than two weeks between their return and the opening of camps. Players on the Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers and Toronto Raptors will have even less than that, along with a trip back to Asia for early-October exhibition games in Japan or China. Colangelo also cited the fact that the World Cup and Olympics are in back-to-back years (with an NBA season in between), instead of two years apart like they were in the past. And while this year\u2019s World Cup is toward the end of the summer, next year\u2019s Olympics start July 25, with training camp probably opening not long after The Finals. (If it were the same six-week period from the start of camp to the gold medal game as it is this year, next year\u2019s camp would actually open on June 29).  Fox and Harris aren\u2019t on the official Senior Team roster, but Colangelo said Monday that they have a chance of making the final 12-man roster for the World Cup. So that makes 17 players for 12 spots. By position, they are:  There\u2019s obviously some flexibility in there. Two point guards could play together, Mitchell could play some point guard, and all of the small forwards could play some at power forward. Lowry, who had surgery on his left thumb just a few weeks ago, isn\u2019t participating in camp this week. He\u2019s hoping to be cleared to practice when the team reconvenes in Los Angeles from Aug. 13-16 for three more days of practice and an exhibition game against Spain. But right now, it\u2019s not guaranteed that he\u2019ll be able to play. With or without him, it\u2019s still a very talented group. \u201cThank goodness we\u2019re blessed with the depth of talent we have in this country,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cYou find guys that want to play and you go with them.\u201d Cutting down the list from 17 players to 12 won\u2019t be easy. Point guard, where Lowry has the experience and Walker is the star, may be the only position where there\u2019s a clear hierarchy. At each of the other positions, different players bring different skill sets, but it\u2019s not clear that Player A is better than Player B, who is better than Player C. The World Cup doesn\u2019t require final rosters until the day before the tournament starts (it\u2019s earlier for the Olympics), so the final decisions don\u2019t have to be made before the team flies from L.A. to Australia for three more exhibition games. \u201cWe\u2019re flexible,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cIf we have a tough decision to make, we\u2019ll bring an extra guy or two with us.\u201d Of the 17 players in camp, only three have played for the United States in an international competition on the senior level. Plumlee was on the 2014 World Cup team , and both Lowry and Barnes were on the 2016 Olympic team . However, neither Plumlee (11th on the \u201914 team in total minutes) nor Barnes (last on the \u201916 team in total minutes) played integral roles. The 2010 World Cup team was similarly inexperienced \u2014 Chauncey Billups and Tyson Chandler played on the 2007 FIBA Americas team \u2014 but had four future Kia MVPs: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook. That 2010 team had seven players who were selected in the top five in the NBA Draft. Since 1992, there have been 15 U.S. National Teams comprised of NBA players. And those 15 teams have had an average of seven top-five picks on them, with *no fewer than four. * The two teams with only four top-five picks: The 2002 team that finished sixth at the World Championship and the 2016 Olympic team that won gold in Rio. This 17-man group includes only three top-five picks: Brown (No. 3 in 2016), Fox (No. 5 in 2017) and Tatum (No. 3 pick in 2017). It would be a surprise if Fox makes the final roster. Since 1992, the only one of those 15 U.S. teams that didn\u2019t have a No. 1 pick on it was the 2000 Olympic team , which had nine players who were selected second (4), third (1), or fifth (4). This 17-man roster includes just one player who has made an All-NBA team in the last three seasons. That\u2019s Walker, who was a third team selection this season. With the ball in his hands Walker could be the star of this team. And he sees the roster attrition as an opportunity. \u201cI think a lot of us are happy those guys pulled out,\u201d Walker said Monday. \u201cThis is our chance, our chance to get on the big stage and showcase our talent. It\u2019s a chance for us to do something new. It\u2019ll be a new-look team. Everybody\u2019s kind of doubting us, but I think we\u2019re hungry.\u201d When he was asked why he remained committed, Walker\u2019s explanation was pretty simple. \u201cI love basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to play. What better opportunity can you have than to play for your country? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a lot of us.\u201d Lopez has nominated himself as the player that has made the biggest sacrifice to be in Vegas, because if he wasn\u2019t, he\u2019d be in the Scottish Highlands with the rest of his family. \u201cI could be looking for Nessy!\u201d Lopez said. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Here are 10 things to know about the tournament and the Americans\u2019 quest for an unprecedented third gold medal in the event. * * * WHAT IS IT? The World Cup is a 32-team tournament running from Aug. 31 through Sept. 15, and used to be called the world championships before a rebranding after the 2010 event. The 32 teams heading to China qualified for the event over the past couple years, and were randomly drawn into one of eight different four-team groups. The top two finishers in each group will advance to the second round. > NBA TV to televise five USA Basketball exhibition games WHY THE SCHEDULE SWITCH? World Cups are an every-four-years event, just like the Olympics. Except this time, five years have passed between World Cups. The primary reason for the extra year is because FIBA, basketball\u2019s governing body, wanted to avoid having its World Cup in the same year as FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body, holds its World Cup for men. So there was no World Cup of basketball in 2018, shifting instead to this year. WHAT\u2019S AT STAKE? Besides the World Cup itself, the tournament is a qualifier for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. There are seven teams \u2014 two from the Americas, two from Europe and one each from the Africa, Asia and Oceania regions \u2014 that will qualify for Tokyo based on their finish at the World Cup. Another four spots will be decided in qualifying in July 2020. The only spot clinched already for the 12-team bracket in Tokyo is the one that went to Japan, which automatically qualified as host. WHO\u2019S PLAYING IN THE WORLD CUP? China got the only automatic bid, as the tournament host. The Chinese are in Group A, along with Venezuela, Poland and the Ivory Coast. Other groups are: \u2022 Group B: Russia, Argentina, South Korea, Nigeria \u2022 Group C: Spain, Iran, Puerto Rico, Tunisia \u2022 Group D: Angola, Philippines, Italy, Serbia \u2022 Group E: United States, Turkey, Czech Republic, Japan \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u2022 Group F: Greece, New Zealand, Brazil, Montenegro \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u2022 Group G: Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Jordan \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u2022 Group H: Canada, Senegal, Lithuania, Australia. WHO WILL THE U.S. SEND TO CHINA? That is still to be determined. There was a list of 35 players picked in the spring of 2018 as part of the \u201cplayer pool\u201d for the World Cup and Olympics, and most of those players withdrew from World Cup consideration long ago (though remain eligible for the Olympic team). There are 15 national team players in training camp in Las Vegas, and another 14 more \u201cselect team\u201d players who can move up. The U.S. \u2014 winners of the World Cup in 2010 and 2014 \u2014 will release its 12-man team for China on Aug. 17. IS THIS A \u201cDREAM TEAM?\u201d Not really. The 12 players going to China for the U.S. will all be NBA players, but it seems like more than half of the final roster will be made up by players who haven\u2019t been All-Stars yet. The biggest U.S. stars, like LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Paul George, Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis are all passing on World Cup for various reasons. But it isn\u2019t uncommon for the World Cup roster to be younger in nature, while the Olympic roster tends to have much more star power. WHY AREN\u2019T THE BIG STARS PLAYING? There are a lot of reasons for that, but mainly because of the schedule. Take Leonard and George as an example. They\u2019re now teammates with the Los Angeles Clippers, a team that many people think could reach the NBA Finals. If they make a deep playoff run, this is how the 2019-20 season would look for them \u2014 World Cup, followed by about a week off before training camp, then the season, then the playoffs and then Olympic team duties in July 2020. That\u2019s a lot of basketball without a break, and it definitely scared some people off from being part of the World Cup. IS THE U.S. FAVORED? Yes, by a wide margin, even with the roster uncertainty. Serbia, which will be led by Nikola Jokic, figures to be a very strong contender at the World Cup. Spain and France should be very good as well, but the Americans \u2014 ranked No. 1 in the world by FIBA \u2014 will be the team to beat. WHO IS COACHING THE U.S.? San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich was picked as Mike Krzyzewski\u2019s successor with the national team in 2015, about a year before the Duke coach finished his USA Basketball tenure with another Olympic gold at the Rio Games. Popovich oversaw a brief camp last summer, but this World Cup will be his first real competition as head coach for the Americans. He\u2019ll be assisted in China by Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr, Atlanta\u2019s Lloyd Pierce and Villanova\u2019s Jay Wright. HOW DID THE U.S. QUALIFY? Because many of the qualification \u201cwindows\u201d \u2014 there were six two-game sets scheduled at various times over the last 18 months \u2014 conflicted with the NBA season, the U.S. used G League players to get through those rounds. Jeff Van Gundy (who will be part of the support staff for Popovich for the World Cup as well) coached the Americans in qualifying and had essentially six different teams for those 12 games, during which 52 players saw time. The Americans qualified comfortably even without NBA assistance. * * * Read more  about the 2019 FIBA World Cup."},{"id":32317,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-tv-usa-basketball-exhibition-games-official-release","date":"2019-08-05","title":"NBA TV to televise five USA Basketball men's national team exhibition games beginning August 9","content":" NBA TV will televise all five USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team exhibition games presented by Nike, beginning with the Blue-White intra-squad game live from Las Vegas on Friday, Aug. 9, at 10 p.m. ET.

Canada is heading back to the World Cup for the first time since the 2010 FIBA World Championship after finishing the FIBA Basketball World Cup Americas Qualifiers with a 10-2 record to lead Group F. One of the fastest rising basketball nations in the world, Canada\u2019s depth was on display during the Americas Qualifiers as 36 different players represented their country over the course of the six competition windows to qualify for the World Cup. The FIBA Basketball World Cup 2019 in China (Aug. 31-Sept. 15, 2019) will be the biggest edition of FIBA\u2019s flagship event with a record 32 participating teams playing 92 games over 16 days. Canada is in Group H for the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2019 and will face Australia (September 1), Lithuania (September 3) and Senegal (September 5) in the First Round. The top two teams from Group G (Dominican Republic, France, Germany and Jordan) and Group H will qualify for the Second Round and form Group L. The results of the three games from the First Round carry over to the Second Round with every team playing against the two teams in their new group that they have not faced. The top two teams from each group will qualify for the Quarter-Finals.

After what the two-time defending World Cup champion Americans have been through just to get to camp, that\u2019s a very good sign. It took more than 50 invitations \u2014 and probably that many revisions of plans \u2014 to get to Sunday, the day where 15 members of the current national team arrived in Las Vegas for meetings and final preparations before the first training camp practice under new USA Basketball coach Gregg Popovich starts Monday. Also in Las Vegas: 14 more NBA players on an enhanced practice squad known as the select team, and it\u2019s a very real possibility that some of those players \u2014 Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox probably among them \u2014 will get a good look at moving up to the national team and potentially going to China for the World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some fun,\u201d Colangelo said. It\u2019ll likely be a young group going to China, no matter who is on the plane. USA Basketball said at least six of the 12 players on the last three World Cup rosters were 24 or younger at the time, and that looks like it could be the case again. Of the 15 players on the national team now, six are 24 are younger. Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo said after arriving in Las Vegas on Sunday that he didn\u2019t hesitate when he got the call inquiring about whether he\u2019d want to play. \u201cI was like, \u2018Who would say no to this chance?\u2019\u201d the 22-year-old Adebayo said. Popovich has said finalizing a 12-man roster for China won\u2019t be easy. Then again, he likely wasn\u2019t counting on this much attrition. This process of building a team for China started last year with 35 players being added to the selection pool for the World Cup and next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. Of those 35, 30 have already withdrawn from World Cup consideration for a variety of reasons \u2014 pending fatherhood, injury rehabilitation, filming a movie, preparing for the potential of a long NBA season. The World Cup will end on Sept. 15, meaning the U.S. players, if they made the medal round, would get home about two weeks before NBA camps open. More than a dozen other names were officially added to the national team list along the way, with two of those players dropping out already as well. Others like New Orleans\u2019 J.J. Redick were invited but declined even before being formally added to the list. Add it all up, and there have been at least 52 players under real consideration in the last year and a half. That doesn\u2019t include the select-teamers, others who were considered for that squad like New Orleans rookie and No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson (who declined) \u2014 or the 52 G League players who went through 12 qualifying games needed to get the U.S. into the World Cup. \u201cThe focus has to be on who\u2019s here \u2014 not who\u2019s not here,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cA number of the young players in this group have a chance, a real chance, some of them to make this team, some of them to make an impact in the World Cup.\u201d NOTES: Kyle Lowry of the NBA champion Toronto Raptors is in Las Vegas, but still has not been cleared to play following thumb surgery. He\u2019s scheduled to meet with doctors in the coming days and hopes to participate when the second part of camp shifts to El Segundo, California next week. \u2026 The team will practice Monday through Thursday, then scrimmage Friday. \u2026 Colangelo said NBA free agent Carmelo Anthony, who has been a USA Basketball standout in the past, was not considered for the World Cup roster."},{"id":32322,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-wall-discusses-injury-rehab-wizards-beal","date":"2019-08-04","title":"John Wall discusses injury rehabilitation, Wizards' outlook","content":" John Wall has been mostly out of the NBA spotlight since foot injuries ended his season early and drastically altered the outlook for the Washington Wizards\u2019 2019-20 campaign.

His opinion hasn\u2019t changed. Green and the Warriors have agreed on the terms of a four-year extension worth nearly $100 million. ESPN first reported the agreement , citing Green\u2019s agent, Rich Paul. Green\u2019s new deal will start with the 2020-21 season, so he is under contract through 2023-24. Klay Thompson signed a five-year, $190 million extension with the Warriors last month, and Stephen Curry is under contract through the 2021-22 season, so three major pieces of the Warriors\u2019 half-decade of success are now locked up for at least three more years. \u201cI think everybody thinks it\u2019s kind of the end of us,\u201d Green said in June, after the Warriors lost a six-game series to Toronto in the NBA Finals and saw their run of two straight titles come to an end. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not smart. We\u2019re not done yet. \u2026 But, yeah, I hear a lot of that noise, `It\u2019s the end of a run\u2019 and all that jazz. I don\u2019t see it happening though. We\u2019ll be back.\u201d The Warriors added All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell this summer, while losing two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant to Brooklyn as well as parting way with Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and Shaun Livingston. So in many ways it will be a different Golden State team this coming season, when the five-time defending Western Conference champion begins playing its home games in the new Chase Center in San Francisco after moving from Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena. But the core \u2013 Curry, Green and, when he returns from his ACL injury, Thompson \u2013 will still be around. \u201cOur core \u2013 myself, Klay, Draymond, adding D\u2019Angelo and a lot of hungry, young guys trying to prove themselves in the league \u2013 it will look different in terms of the lineups and things like that,\u201d Curry said last month. \u201cBut the expectations of how we play and that championship-caliber basketball, that\u2019s going to be for us always be the motivation and the challenge.\u201d Over the past five seasons, the Warriors have won 77% of their games, including playoffs \u2013 a total of 399 wins, 100 more than any other NBA team in that span. Green has been an enormous part of that success. He is one of the league\u2019s elite defenders, a five-time All-NBA defensive team selection and the defensive player of the year in the 2016-17 season. Green, Curry and Thompson are the lone remaining Warriors players to have been on each of their last three NBA championship teams, in 2015, 2017 and 2018. Green averaged 7.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game last season.

Anthony went on to cover a broad number of topics, among them his decision to re-sign for a longer period with the Nuggets than Dwyane Wade and LeBron James did with the Heat and Cavaliers when the group became extension eligible in 2006. That led to Chris Bosh ultimately joining the \u2018Heatles\u2019 for their 2010-14 Finals runs.

The tournament, which runs August 6-11 in at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, features the top 13- and 14-year-old boys and girls basketball players from around the world. Fox Sports will broadcast 16 games in the United States across FOX, FS1 and FS2 throughout the weeklong event, with a long list of top-tier game analysts and play-by-play talent including Vince Carter, Brian Custer, Noah Eagle, Mark Followill, Sarah Kustok, Donny Marshall and Charissa Thompson. K\/S Elite All Stars became one of 16 U.S. teams that will compete against 16 teams from eight global regions: Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, China, Europe & Middle East, India, Latin America and Mexico. The 32 teams, which will be split into boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 divisions, emerged from the more than 15,000 kids in 75 countries who competed to reach the Global Championship. \u201cGoing to Orlando is a great experience playing teams [from] around the [world],\u201d Christian Bliss, who finished just shy of a triple-double in K\/S Elite\u2019s victory, said in a video posted on the Jr. NBA\u2019s Instagram page. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean a lot. I\u2019m excited.\u201d The tournament will not only crown a champion but also reinforce the Jr. NBA\u2019s core values of teamwork, respect, determination and community by prioritizing life skills development and player health and wellness. It will also provide the players with memorable experiences off the court. The goal is to \u201celevate the youth basketball experience,\u201d said David Krichavsky, Head of Youth Basketball Development at the NBA. The NBA was already making a positive impact on young players through its Jr. NBA program. The program for youth ages 6-14 focuses on its core values and teaching basketball fundamentals so boys and girls learn the right way to play the game. It\u2019s reaching 52 million boys and girls in 75 countries this year. Still, Krichavsky could see something else was needed. \u201cOne thing the program lacked was anything that unified all those players,\u201d he said. \u201cNow with the Jr. NBA Global Championship, you can compete locally and regionally, and if successful, earn a spot in Orlando.\u201d Interest in the tournament has increased from a year ago. The Jr. NBA Global Championship reached 5,000 more youth players this year and has seen a double-digit growth in corporate sponsorships. Anchoring the growth is the guiding purpose that teaches lifelong values of the game. \u201cAs much as the tournament is a competitive on-court experience, we value the off-court experience as well,\u201d Krichavsky said. \u201cWe have life skills seminars, educational workshops and NBA Cares community service projects. We think there\u2019s an opportunity to create a best-in-class model for youth tournaments when it comes to the experience for the players, coaches, parents and referees.\u201d The players will play games on August 6 and 7, then spend a day participating in a community service project that will leave a lasting impact in Orlando. They will also attend seminars that teach life skills and other positive values. Last year Dwyane Wade surprised the players and spent time answering their questions about life and basketball \u2013 and he\u2019ll be back this year along with current and former NBA and WNBA players Mike Conley, Breanna Stewart, Swin Cash, Bo Outlaw and Nick Anderson, among others. The games resume on August 9 and culminate with the global championship games on August 11. The off-court activities especially appeal to Allen Skeens, head coach of Drive5 Power Elite, which won the tournament last year by defeating the Africa & Middle East team in the Finals and advanced again this year to represent the Central Region. His team plays in tournaments throughout the year, but the Global Championship stands out. \u201cThe NBA does everything the right way. They talk to the kids about proper nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and paying attention to your social media,\u201d said Skeens, whose team is composed of all new players. \u201cI also make sure that my players focus on giving back too. We do community service, so I\u2019m glad that\u2019s a part of this tournament as well.\u201d He said the players also benefit from the global aspect of the tournament. \u201cThey get to see that the game they love is truly a global game,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s one basketball and it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from."},{"id":32368,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-add-jason-kidd-staff","date":"2019-07-31","title":"Lakers make it official, add Jason Kidd to coaching staff","content":" EL SEGUNDO, Calif.

Picked No. 1 in the NBA draft by the New Orleans Pelicans. Signed his first pro contract that could be worth as much as $45 million over the next four years. Went to summer league and got hurt after nine minutes. Considered playing for USA Basketball in China this summer. Landed a massive endorsement deal with Jordan Brand. Became very rich very quickly. And now, a video game deal. Williamson has signed with 2K, he and the video-game giant announced Tuesday, and the former Duke standout will make his video-game debut in NBA 2K20 when it launches on Sept. 6. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cNone of this will ever seem normal to me.\u201d A person familiar with the terms said Williamson and 2K agreed on a three-year contract. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the deal have not been released. It\u2019s the latest major deal in a rapidly growing off-court enterprise for Williamson, perhaps the most celebrated No. 1 pick to enter the league since LeBron James in 2003. \u201cWhen I put the CD in the console, I don\u2019t have to create me as a player,\u201d Williamson told the AP at a party in Las Vegas to commemorate the game\u2019s release, moments after NBA players like Portland\u2019s Hassan Whiteside tried the game for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m there as a player. That\u2019s going to take some getting used to. This is not normal. I can\u2019t even put it into words. I\u2019m honored.\u201d Williamson is an imposing figure already \u2014 6-foot-7, 284 pounds, blessed with the combination of size and strength that leaves backboards shaking for many seconds after he unleashes a powerful dunk. He\u2019s also a young man who remains a work in progress. His fitness has been called into question, and he\u2019s spending the weeks leading into his first NBA training camp \u2014 now less than two months away \u2014 getting his body ready for the rigors of his first 82-game season, after a minor knee issue ended his summer league experience in Las Vegas earlier this month after just one half of one game. \u201cZion represents the best of the NBA\u2019s up and coming talent and we are excited to welcome him to Team 2K. \u2026 We\u2019re excited to grow with him,\u201d NBA 2K Senior Vice President of Basketball Operations Jason Argent said. Even with all these things coming at him at once \u2014 he already had fame, and now he has the fortune that can come with it \u2014 Williamson insists that he is remaining grounded. He didn\u2019t arrive for his video-game coming out party with a massive entourage, just his dad and a couple members of his management team. He didn\u2019t immediately gravitate toward the bigger names in the room high above the Vegas skyline, but rather some young kids who were busy playing the game. And he cringed at the notion that he\u2019s already considered a star. \u201cI just turned 19, I have yet to play an NBA game and I know I still have to prove that I belong,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI\u2019m a rookie. I have a lot to prove.\u201d Williamson is fond of saying that he\u2019s merely living his dream, and he knows it sounds a bit cliche.

After Lillard got a contract extension earlier this summer, the Blazers have done likewise for McCollum, too. As first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Blazers and McCollum have agreed to a three-year contract extension that will keep McCollum under contract with Portland through 2023-24. Had he not agreed to this extension, valued at $100 million (per Wojnarowski), McCollum would have become an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2021. McCollum and Lillard will be under contract together for the next five seasons. \u201cCJ McCollum is a franchise cornerstone and a critical part of our future,\u201d Blazers GM Neil Olshey said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThis extension represents a strong level of commitment between CJ, the Trail Blazers and the city of Portland.\u201d As news of the extension became known, McCollum responded to congratulatory tweets from teammate Jusuf Nurkic and other fellow NBA players. Lillard signed his extension earlier this month and that deal will keep him with the Blazers through the 2024-25 season. Lillard\u2019s deal will will pay him $196 million over four seasons, per multiple reports . McCollum, the 10th overall pick in the 2013 Draft, has blossomed into a star in short order with Portland. After averaging 6.3 points, 1.4 rebounds and 0.9 assists in his first two NBA seasons, McCollum took flight in the 2015-16 season. In that campaign, he averaged 20.8 ppg, 3.2 rpg and 4.3 apg and collected Kia Most Improved Player honors that season.  Since then, he has continued to improve. From 2017-18 through last season, McCollum has averaged 21.8 ppg, 3.9 rpg and 3.3 apg while shooting 39.8 percent on 3-pointers and 46.1 percent overall. He and Lillard have teamed to make Portland a contender in the Western Conference as it reached the conference finals in 2019 and the West semifinals in 2015-16. The Blazers won 53 games last season \u2014 their most since 2014-15 \u2014 and won the Northwest Division title in the 2017-18 season. The Blazers reached the 2019 West finals in large part because of McCollum\u2019s performance in the Western Conference semifinals. In Game 7 of the series on the road vs. the Denver Nuggets, he came through with 37 points on 17-for-29 shooting on a night when Lillard struggled (3-for-17, 13 points). Although the Blazers were swept in the West finals by the Golden State Warriors, McCollum was solid in that series as well (22 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 4.5 apg). McCollum and Lillard were withdrew from consideration for the Men\u2019s National Team roster schedule to compete at the FIBA World Cup later this summer in China. In leading the Trail Blazers to their first Western Conference Finals appearance in nearly 20 years, Lillard and McCollum logged considerably more minutes than they\u2019re accustomed to. Though they were eventually swept in the conference finals, Portland\u2019s season didn\u2019t end until May 20, which made the offseason shorter for the Blazers\u2019 star duo. Casey Holdahl of Blazers.com reports Lillard and McCollum not participating in the 2019 FIBA World Cup will not diminish either player\u2019s chances of making the 2020 Tokyo Olympics team.

And he\u2019s ready to do whatever it takes to make the move work as he prepares to play with James Harden for the first time since 2012. \u201cTo be able to win something you have to be able to sacrifice some parts of your game and we both understand that,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cWe both understand that we have one common goal and that\u2019s to win championships. We understand what we have to do.\u201d Westbrook was introduced in Houston on Friday after being traded from the Thunder for Chris Paul and draft picks this month. General manager Daryl Morey beamed as he sat next to Westbrook when he made his first appearance as a member of the Rockets. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re here for one reason only, to take that next step that we\u2019ve been trying to do for the last few years,\u201d Morey said. The 2017 Most Valuable Player joins the Rockets after spending his first 11 seasons with Oklahoma City, which included playing with Harden in his first three seasons. Though the two are close friends and played together successfully with the Thunder, in the days since the trade, many have wondered if pairing these two ball-dominant guards will be successful in Houston. Westbrook brushed off such concerns. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know James is not worried about it. I can play off the ball. I don\u2019t have to touch the ball to impact the game. I can do other things on the floor to make sure we have a better chance to win.\u201d Harden didn\u2019t speak to reporters Friday, but did attend the press conference, sitting on the front row smiling at his buddy and often chuckling at Westbrook\u2019s comments and jokes. The Westbrook who showed up in Houston on Friday was a kinder and far less angry one than the version he was during last year\u2019s playoffs when a sneering and glaring Westbrook made headlines more for his \u201cnext question\u201d responses during press conferences than his play as the Thunder were eliminated by Portland in the first round. He smiled often and laughed a lot, and when asked what he wished people knew about him he quickly responded with: \u201cthat I\u2019m a nice guy.\u201d Westbrook said he\u2019ll never stop playing with the intensity and attitude that he\u2019s played with throughout his career, but he seemed to be taking a step to try and repair the negative image that came from last year\u2019s press conference antics by sharing thoughts on his personality. \u201cI\u2019m going out to compete and going out to be able to win and I don\u2019t really care how that looks and I\u2019m always going to stay that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think off the floor it\u2019s a huge thing figuring (out) and understanding that I am human. I am a human being. I am a good person, just so you guys know. And I do care about the community, my team, my teammates, everybody and I just want to do whatever I can to make sure we have a chance to win.\u201d The opportunity to win his first championship was the biggest lure to Westbrook\u2019s desire to be in Houston. And the fact that it\u2019s has him back with Harden, with whom he\u2019s been friends with since he was 10 years old, made the chance too good to pass up. \u201cI thought it was the best decision for me and my career right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to be able to reunite with my brother, a friend, to be able to do that is something that you dream about and you live for.\u201d Westbrook is an eight-time All-Star who has averaged a triple-double in each of the last three seasons. He led the NBA in assists in the last two seasons and ranked second in the two seasons before that. The 30-year-old has averaged 23 points, 8.4 assists and seven rebounds in his career and has played 80 or more games in seven seasons. The Rockets hope his addition will help them win their first championship since taking back-to-back titles from 1994-95. After falling to the Warriors in the playoffs in four of the last five seasons and seeing the Lakers and Clippers make huge offseason moves, Houston is betting on Westbrook to elevate this Harden-led team. \u201cHe plays with an energy, a passion and a will to win that I think is really unparalleled in the league,\u201d Morey said. And Westbrook is ready to show everyone that will to win with his new team. \u201cScoring and having the ball in my hands is not the only thing I can do for the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI do a lot of great things for the game and I look forward to doing that with this team \u2026 I think it\u2019s a great opportunity to be able to bring a championship here to Houston.

Gone is All-Star forward and Kia MVP candidate Paul George (who was traded to the LA Clippers ). And gone as well is former Kia MVP winner and franchise icon Russell Westbrook (who was traded to the Houston Rockets ). In making those moves, the Thunder amassed a trove of future Draft picks. They also picked up All-Star point guard Chris Paul (via the Westbrook trade with the Rockets) and Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (via the Clippers). But after many years of being a playoff team and, at times, a legitimate Finals contender, Oklahoma City seems poised for a step back next season \u2014 and perhaps beyond. In an article published by The Oklahoman newspaper, Thunder GM Sam Presti penned his thoughts on the offseason and the road that lies ahead for his franchise. He also spoke with local media about the franchise\u2019s overhaul on Thursday, addressing George\u2019s trade to the Clippers and other topics. In the piece in The Oklahoman , Presti praised how the Thunder\u2019s success over the past 11 seasons have \u201cbrought confidence and recognition to a city and a state that has too often been overlooked.\u201d He then wrote about the transition phase the Thunder are in and how small-market teams like Oklahoma City face \u201cstrategic challenges\u201d and operate with \u201cstrategic disadvantages.\u201d Here\u2019s more of what Presti wrote in his piece in The Oklahoman : In an interview with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols on Wednesday, George categorized his trade from OKC to L.A. as a mutual decision between he and the Thunder. Presti pushed back against that a bit on Thursday, saying he didn\u2019t necessarily agree with that and that the team did not want to trade George. Presti said from what he was told that the \u201copportunity to play with Kawhi, the opportunity to go to L.A. were the biggest factors for him. We understand that and were able to make the most of the situation.\u201d The run in Oklahoma City under Westbrook wasn\u2019t supposed to end yet, but George left first for the Clippers, opening the door for an earlier-than-expected reboot. Thunder forward Jerami Grant was traded before Westbrook, and now Oklahoma City has added multiple first-round picks for its rebuilding project. It will take time and coach Billy Donovan will get plenty of chances to tinker with his lineup and give young players experience. Oklahoma City got five future first-round selections as part of the George trade. They received two more in the Westbrook-to-Houston trade and got a 2020 first-round pick in the Grant-to-Denver deal. In his article in The Oklahoman , Presti said the goal now is to build a team that will be successful again. In doing so, Presti wrote, there will be the \u201ctemptation to take shortcuts, to look for quick fixes, and to reach out for instant gratification.\u201d However, Presti said that is something he wants to avoid as his goal is to \u201creposition and replenish the organization to allow for optimal future success.\u201d \u201cOver the past two weeks, our reactions and adaptations have provided us a starting point,\u201d Presti wrote in the newspaper. \u201cBut the real work has yet to begin. Our goal is sustainable, long-term, collective excellence. The people of Oklahoma City should be able to one day watch the rise of another great team, as they have watched the rise of their rebuilt downtown, with the knowledge that they are witnessing something not only great but enduring. Invest today for a sustainable tomorrow.\u201d Westbrook was the last remaining player from the team that moved from Seattle to Oklahoma City in 2008. In recent seasons, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Serge Ibaka, George and others have left the team via trades or free agency. Westbrook spent his entire 11-year career with the Thunder, despite earlier chances to leave. With Westbrook, the Thunder won at least 45 games for 10 straight years and reached the Western Conference finals four times, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2012. Most of all, Westbrook will be remembered as the one who had stayed. He signed an extension in 2016 , then signed a long-term deal in 2017 , forever endearing himself to Oklahoma City fans who felt burned by Durant\u2019s departure for rival Golden State. Durant, Westbrook and Harden teamed up to introduce the Thunder as a league power early this decade. At their height, the young trio led the franchise to The Finals seven years ago , a loss to the Miami Heat. Now Westbrook is reunited with Harden.

In addition to the arena, the proposed project located on West Century Boulevard between South Prairie Avenue and South Yukon Avenue will include the team\u2019s business and basketball offices, training facility, community and retail spaces. \u201cMy goal is simple. I want the Clippers to have the best home in all of sports,\u201d said Clippers Chairman Steve Ballmer. \u201cWhat that means to me is an unparalleled environment for players, for fans, for sponsors and for the community of Inglewood. Our goal is to build a facility that resets fans\u2019 expectations while having a transformative impact on the city we will call home.\u201d The Inglewood Basketball & Entertainment Center will revitalize mostly vacant land under the flight path of Los Angeles International Airport into a vibrant campus. The project is targeted for completion by fall of 2024, following the expiration of the Clippers\u2019 lease at STAPLES Center. \u201cInglewood is a diverse, dynamic community blessed with a skilled workforce, emerging infrastructure and a bold economic blueprint for the future,\u201d said Gillian Zucker, Clippers President of Business Operations. \u201cIn addition to the thousands of jobs this facility will create for the local community, we are equally committed to working with our new neighbors in the continuing renaissance developing in the City of Inglewood.\u201d The proposed arena will have a three-dimensional oval design with a unique exterior of diamond-shaped metal panels inspired by the concept of a basketball swishing through a net. In addition to attractive aesthetics, the panels have been designed to provide solar benefit for maximum energy efficiency, as part of the facility\u2019s LEED GOLD-certified design. The facility\u2019s most striking feature, intended to highlight the temperate climate of Southern California, is the integration of indoor\/outdoor \u201csky gardens.\u201d These landscaped areas for food and beverage will be accessible from every concourse level. The complex also envisions a multi-purpose plaza complete with concert stage, community basketball courts and space for the community to gather and watch everything from Clippers Playoff games to movie premieres on a supersized LED screen. The Clippers campus will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions through a combination of carbon offset credits and sustainable design features. The project is being developed by Wilson Meany, a developer heralded for its transformative mixed-use residential, retail, office and master-planned properties. \u201cWe challenged the architects and designers on this project to create a landmark facility that exceeds current environmental standards and they have surpassed expectations,\u201d said Chris Meany of Wilson Meany. \u201cThe new Clippers arena demonstrates that environmental protection and economic development need not be mutually exclusive.\u201d The project is expected to create an estimated 10,000 construction jobs and more than 1,500 permanent jobs, with local hire components in place to fill 30 percent of available construction jobs with local labor and 35 percent of the available arena operation jobs with local residents. When completed, the complex will generate an estimated $268 million in economic activity for Inglewood annually, and more than $190 million in new tax revenue from 2020-2045. That revenue will help support vital city services such as schools, parks, libraries and police and fire stations. \u201cWe are excited to welcome the nation\u2019s most philanthropic sports team to Inglewood,\u201d said Mayor James T. Butts. \u201cOver the past three years, the Ballmers and the Clippers have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to improving communities like Inglewood. The Clippers\u2019 presence in our city will create a sustainable revenue source and boost civic pride, revitalizing our community for years to come.\u201d The Inglewood Basketball & Entertainment Center was designed by AECOM, a Los Angeles-based architectural, engineering and construction management and services firm, headed by Bill Hanway, Global Sports Leader at AECOM. Hanway also leads the AECOM team providing design, engineering and construction strategy services for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Anderson Barker Architects and City Design Studio of Los Angeles designed the plaza buildings. Hood Studios of California provided the landscape architecture."},{"id":32385,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-open-offseason-process","date":"2019-07-26","title":"Kawhi Leonard says he was 'very close' to signing with Lakers, Raptors","content":"After being introduced as a member of the LA Clippers for the first time on Wednesday, Kawhi Leonard spoke about his week-long free agency process.

Real close,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cBut when (the Clippers) presented the opportunity of playing with Paul it was easy, it was a yes. I said let\u2019s get it going.\u201d Leonard said in his introductory news conference that he has always wanted to play with George, a fellow Southern California native. He followed that statement up with high praise for the six-time All-Star in speaking with Nichols. \u201cThis is probably going to be my first time playing with an elite player on his level around the same age as me, same talent,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d Some reports claimed that Leonard lost interest in the Lakers when former team president Magic Johnson told the media about his meeting with the free agent superstar. Other reports said Leonard intentionally took his time to make a decision in an effort to make the Lakers miss out on other targets in free agency. The reigning Finals MVP denied such talk, telling Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports that the leaks from Magic had no effect on his decision and that he never intended \u201cto screw anybody over.\u201d \u201cI just feel like that\u2019s just bad karma,\u201d Leonard said in reference to manipulating teams. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want to wait for me, they didn\u2019t have to. They had a big opportunity to sign me. I was close, but I ended up on the other side.\u201d George, meanwhile, opened up on how he was acquired via trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder. The 29-year-old forward says he and the Thunder front office came to a mutual understanding back when George re-signed to a four-year deal in 2018. \u201cThis was nothing that came out of the blue,\u201d George told Nichols. \u201cThe initial plan was to give it another year, see what we could do. I did that. Played another year, and it felt like we were just stagnant. Next thing was, let\u2019s go forward and go on with other plans.\u201d George said former teammate Russell Westbrook, who was subsequently traded to the Houston Rockets , stood by his decision and was \u201call for it\u201d, per Nichols .

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report forward Dragan Bender has agreed to a two-year deal with the Bucks. The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2016 draft by the Phoenix Suns, Bender saw his role diminish last season after showing some signs of promise in his first two NBA seasons. Bender played in 46 games last season, averaging five points and four rebounds in 18 minutes per game. His best season came in 2017-18, when he averaged 6.5 ppg and 4.4 rpg in 25.2 mpg in 82 games. After seeing an uptick in 3-point shooting in 2017-18 (36.6%), Bender has struggled from deep and shot just 21.8% from 3-point range last season. Keith Smith of Yahoo Sports reports Bender had an agreement to head to Russia if he couldn\u2019t land an NBA deal. In Milwaukee, Bender joins a forward rotation that includes reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo (and his brother, Thanasis) and veterans Ersan Ilyasova, Khris Middleton and D.J. Wilson.

But let the record show that their first appearance in public together was initially a chemistry failure. As they stood for the obligatory jersey-raising photo, Leonard was to the left of George and something didn\u2019t seem right. Leave it to Doc Rivers, one of the game\u2019s best coaches, to intervene and put his new players in the right spot. And so the official photo now shows Leonard holding his No. 2 next to George\u2019s No. 13, forming the Los Angeles area code and therefore sending well-intended shade to the other team in town.  In order for this to work and the Clippers to reign supreme, those jerseys must someday occupy the ceiling at Staples Center, the building they share with the Lakers. That\u2019s where there\u2019s a major disadvantage from the Clippers\u2019 end. There are no retired Clippers jerseys and that\u2019s a fairly accurate reflection of the history of a franchise that owns zero championships and rarely generated the same level of civic buzz \u2014 even when they were the better team. But what a spectacle that would be if the Leonard-George combo forced LA to hold a parade in the Clippers\u2019 honor and prompted the club to raise a pair of retired jerseys in the distant future \u2014 in the proper 2-13 order, of course. Paul is someone I always wanted to play next to. Now we\u2019re on the Clippers and we have something special together. We can make history here. We got the right team to do it. I\u2019m excited.\u201d Kawhi Leonard, on Paul George In due time, all of this will sort itself out. Until then, the Clippers certainly owned July 24, when George and Leonard made their first public statements as teammates, and when no less than Jerry West, the Laker great-turned Clippers advisor, proclaimed: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the Clippers.\u201d Or, as team president Lawrence Frank echoed: \u201cA landmark moment.\u201d And as chairman Steve Ballmer, who refused to contain himself, so comically chimed in: \u201cI\u2019m pumped.\u201d How can he not be? How can the Clippers not be anxiously awaiting the 2019-20 season, where they find themselves in the unusual but desired position of being \u2026 title favorites? It\u2019s all because of Leonard, fresh from dragging the Toronto Raptors to their first NBA title , and George, fresh from finishing third in the Kia MVP award chase , decided to return to Southern California and try to make the improbable happen. You know the story by now: Leonard, raised in Riverside County, became a free agent this summer and signed with the Clippers after they swung a deal for George , who is from nearby Palmdale and had two years left on his contract with OKC. Both players are 6-foot-8-ish and athletic with a strong taste for defense yet can also double as their team\u2019s leading scorer, as Leonard did with Toronto and George last season with the Thunder. Plus, they are also playmakers who can turn a key steal or 3-point shot into a moment of victory. \u2026 It seemed it was destined that we\u2019re playing together. We\u2019re going to make it happen. I wanted to be a part of something special, to build something special. It\u2019s pretty dope, pretty awesome.\u201d Paul George, on Kawhi Leonard What especially excites Ballmer and the Clippers is how George and Leonard are coming to a ready-made team, with deluxe Kia NBA Sixth Man Lou Williams, low-post big man Montrezl Harrell, defensive pest Patrick Beverley and young shooter Landry Shamet all able to supply ample and proven support. The Clippers won 48 games last season without a superstar. And now? \u201cOne of the toughest things to do is get one superstar,\u201d said Frank, \u201clet alone two who compliment each other.\u201d Curiously, Leonard and George both spoke about the moment when their paths nearly crossed previously. George was then with the Pacers and just starting to show promise as a rookie when the Pacers selected Leonard in the very next draft, in 2011. That tandem was only temporary for a few minutes; Indiana sent Leonard to the Spurs for George Hill. \u201cWhen we drafted Kawhi I was a little confused by it,\u201d said George. \u201cKawhi was at my position and I was a bit nervous about that competition. Fast forward, knowing what I know now, knowing the player he developed into and what I developed into, I wish we would\u2019ve kept him and us together. Would\u2019ve been special for Indiana. \u201cBut we\u2019re both here in LA and it seemed it was destined that we\u2019re playing together. We\u2019re going to make it happen. I wanted to be a part of something special, to build something special. It\u2019s pretty dope, pretty awesome.\u201d Leonard and George knew each other from high school competition in the LA suburbs, developed a respect for each other\u2019s playing style and habits, and soon became All-Stars. When Leonard spoke with the Clippers, he demanded they find a co-star. He and the club went through a list of possible candidates and kept coming back to the same one. \u201cPaul is someone I always wanted to play next to,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cNow we\u2019re on the Clippers and we have something special together. We can make history here. We got the right team to do it. I\u2019m excited.\u201d What separates George and Leonard apart from other tandems \u2014 say, for example, the LeBron James-Anthony Davis behemoth across the hallway \u2014 is their energy on defense. The best and closest comparison is probably Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Being able to guard multiple positions and still have enough for offense is what could bring the Clippers to their first taste of champagne. \u201cHow we play is a lost art in the NBA, where guys want to get after it on both ends,\u201d said George. George also wanted to make one thing clear: There is no competition between the Clippers and Lakers, at least on his end. LA. Our Way. pic.twitter.com\/SbylgAGo6b \u2014 LA Clippers (@LAClippers) July 24, 2019 \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at a battle for LA,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re chasing other things and we\u2019ll build our own legacy along the way.\u201d http:\/\/\u200b%20\ud83d\udccd2\ufe0f\u20e31\ufe0f\u20e33\ufe0f\u20e3%20pic.twitter.com\/JO4PQLhfyu%20%20\u2014%20LA%20Clippers%20(@LAClippers)%20July%2024,%202019%20%20\u200b Of course, it could very well be the Lakers standing in the Clippers\u2019 way and keeping Staples Center free of Clippers\u2019 banners. That\u2019s what the upcoming season is for, to sort out the pecking order and determine who really won this offseason. Well, sort of. He didn\u2019t exactly take a victory lap around the recreation center, where the Clippers donated a basketball court and which served as the site for the press conference, but Ballmer had his running shoes on and was ready to run a marathon. \u201cThey\u2019ll give us a chance to do the only thing we want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re only here for one reason.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Murray, 22, had the best season of his young career in 2018-19, helping lead Denver to 54 games wins and the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. In 75 games (74 starts), he averaged career-highs in points (18.2), assists (4.8) and rebounds (4.2) while shooting 43.7 percent from the field, 36.7% percent from 3-point range and 84.8 percent from the free-throw line. Murray posted a career-high 48 points vs. the Boston Celtics on Nov. 5, and on Dec. 29 at Phoenix he became the first player in Nuggets history to record 46+ points, 6+ rebounds and 8+ assists on the road. Murray also became the fourth player in franchise history to eclipse 3,500 points through his first three seasons (Kiki VanDeWeghe, David Thompson, Carmelo Anthony). \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting day for our franchise to officially announce this contract extension with Jamal,\u201d said President and Governor Josh Kroenke. \u201cMy father and I know what kind of kid Jamal is both on and off the court, and there wasn\u2019t a second of hesitation to get this done as soon as we could. He is an extremely talented player and we look forward to watching him continue to grow as one of the cornerstones of this team for many years to come.\u201d \u201cThe Kroenke family has shown tremendous commitment to continuity and stability, and this is just another example of trusting in what we are all building together as an organization,\u201d stated President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly. \u201cWe were thrilled when we were able to draft Jamal in 2016 because we believed then, as we do now, that he is an extraordinary player and a key part of what we want to accomplish here in Denver. Jamal has shown what he is capable of in his first three seasons in the NBA, particularly in last year\u2019s playoff run, and his future is extremely bright.\u201d The Kitchener, Ontario, native appeared in his first postseason in 2019 helping the Nuggets reach the second round of the playoffs for the first time in 10 years. Murray elevated his game, averaging, 21.3 points, 4.7 assists and 4.4 rebounds while shooting 42.5 percent from the field and 90.3 percent from the charity stripe in 36.3 minutes per game. He posted eight games of 20 or more points, including 34 points in back-to-back games in the second round vs. Portland. Murray became just the eighth player in NBA history to post 290+ points and 20+ three point makes in his first postseason appearance. He is also just the fifth player since 2008 to average 21+ points, 4+ rebounds and 4+ assists in a first-time playoff run. \u201cFirst I\u2019d like to say congratulations to Jamal, I couldn\u2019t be happier for him and his family,\u201d said Head Coach Michael Malone. \u201cHe is a special young man who I\u2019ve been lucky to coach since he was a rookie and I look forward to many more years together. Jamal has put in the time and hard work from day one and I have zero doubt he will continue to do so with the intense drive of becoming the best basketball player he possibly can and helping lead the Nuggets to our ultimate goal, an NBA Championship.\u201d Murray was drafted by the Nuggets with the No. 7 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft out of the University of Kentucky. Over three seasons with Denver, he has appeared in 238 games (164 starts), averaging 14.8 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists while shooting 36.2 percent from long range in 28.5 minutes per game. He has increased his scoring, rebounding and assist average each season of his career. Additionally, the Nuggets own a record of 42-22 (.656) when Murray scores at least 20 points throughout his career. \u201cI want to thank the man above for showing my family and I how life works in a full circle,\u201d said Jamal Murray. \u201cI also want to thank the Nuggets organization for believing in a kid from a small unheard-of town in Canada, and finally to Nuggets fans, I can\u2019t wait to shoot more arrows for you all.\u201d"},{"id":32452,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pau-gasol-joins-trail-blazers-release","date":"2019-07-24","title":"Pau Gasol signs deal with Trail Blazers","content":" PORTLAND, Ore.  \u2014 The Portland Trail Blazers have signed veteran forward\/center Pau Gasol, it was announced Thursday by president of basketball operations Neil Olshey.

The lineup includes a new City Edition designed in partnership with the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum. This City uniform aligns with the upcoming 25th anniversary of the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. The Thunder and the memorial worked closely with Nike to embody the spirit of resilience and remembrance to pay respect to the lives lost and all those impacted by the bombing. It also captures the memorial\u2019s mission of educating current and future generations about the Oklahoma City community\u2019s response to the tragedy, with a focus on the Oklahoma Standard of service, honor and kindness. \u201cApril 19th, 1995 changed our city forever. The Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum serves our community by helping us remember those lost, yet also tells a story of a city that comes together with compassion,\u201d said Thunder Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti. \u201cThe Thunder is honored to continue to strengthen our relationship with the Oklahoma City Memorial with this endeavor. Additionally, the chance to help further the memorial\u2019s efforts around the Oklahoma Standard expands our support beyond that of the uniform. Although the Oklahoma Standard means something unique to everyone individually, raising awareness of its importance and ultimate evolution alongside that of our city is essential. Any progress we can make to help preserve and ultimately further articulate the simple acts of service, honor and kindness that have helped contribute to Oklahoma\u2019s community identity is a pivotal aspect to the broader civic impact we envision.\u201d As part of the Thunder\u2019s partnership with the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, the team will underwrite a new permanent exhibit, which will emphasize and highlight examples of the Oklahoma Standard and provide valuable learning tools to deliver that message to local, national and global audiences. To honor the partnership, the Thunder will fund free admission to the National Memorial Museum once a month for the year 2020. The uniform design features symbols that represent elements of the memorial. Across the chest, \u201cOklahoma City\u201d appears in gold-lined letters, with the twin Gates of Time spanning down the side of the jerseys that carry into the shorts. The times 9:01 and 9:03 appear within the vents of the shorts. They reflect the innocence of the city at 9:01 before the attack, followed by the time the city began to come together and heal at 9:03. The white on the side of the shorts represents the Reflecting Pool, a shallow depth of water that provides comfort and peace. \u201cService,\u201d \u201cHonor\u201d and \u201cKindness\u201d appear above the jersey\u2019s tag \u2013 reflecting the ideals of the Oklahoma Standard, and the manner in which Oklahoma citizens treat one another and their community. The Survivor Tree, a 90-year-old American elm at the site of the memorial, is also depicted in full color on the belt of the uniform\u2019s shorts. The tree serves as a symbol of human resilience and strength as it withstood the force of the 4,000 pound bomb. Inside the jersey, a blue ribbon is layered with the words, \u201cWe Remember Those Who Were Changed Forever, April 19, 1995.\u201d Along the back of the neck, Thunder blue, navy, yellow and sunset stripes tie the uniform to the team\u2019s traditional colors and represent the many gifts of remembrance that visitors left on the fence at the original site and continue to leave at the memorial today. \u201dOur partnership with the Thunder has continued to grow stronger. For more than a decade, every player experiences and comes to understand the Oklahoma Standard by visiting the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum,\u201d said Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum Executive Director, Kari Watkins. \u201cWe have been working together on this meaningful uniform for months. This is a unique way to expand our mission to a global audience and to remember all those impacted. This uniform has many important symbolic elements that are reflective of this sacred site.\u201d \u201cWe are excited about taking our partnership with the Thunder to a whole new level,\u201d said Kim Neese, survivor and chair, Memorial Conscience Committee. \u201cAs the 25th Anniversary of the bombing draws near, having Oklahoma City\u2019s team wear this inspirational uniform continues to honor and remember the 168 people who were killed and all those who were changed forever.\u201d The City Edition uniform is one of four new uniforms the Thunder will wear next season, including refreshed Icon (blue) and Association (white) uniforms, and a new sunset Statement uniform. \u201cRefreshing our uniform lineup allows us to put a new twist on the classic Thunder image,\u201d said Thunder Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Brian Byrnes. \u201cThese updates keep us true to our roots, but allow us to modernize and embolden the Thunder Basketball uniform portfolio as we continue to evolve our brand to proudly reflect our state and city.\u201d Like the blue Icon uniform before it, the team\u2019s white Association uniform will now have \u201cOklahoma City\u201d across the chest in sunset and Thunder blue, with a state outline of Oklahoma on the belt of the shorts. The uniform also has matching neck and arm striping with the primary team logo on the front left leg. This marks the second time the state outline has appeared on a Thunder uniform, as it was also featured on the team\u2019s 2017-18 City Edition uniform. On the Thunder blue Icon uniform, the chest now reads \u201cThunder\u201d on the chest in sunset, with matching neck and arm striping. The blue uniform also features the primary team logo on the front left leg with increased tape striping on the arm and neck. Both uniforms boast a rich color palette, elevating the contrast of the team\u2019s current brand profile. The Icon and Association uniforms will both be worn at home and on the road starting next season. The team\u2019s 2019-20 Statement Edition brings a fan favorite color scheme back to the Thunder\u2019s uniform lineup with a bold sunset design. It marks the first time Thunder blue and sunset have appeared together on a uniform, with a staggered \u201cOKC\u201d in Thunder blue across the chest and gradient tonal sound waves down the back.

And as of Monday morning, 129 (40 percent) of those 320 are no longer with the team on which they ended the season. Of those 129, 103 have found new NBA teams, though only 39 of those 103 changed conferences. Six of the 15 guys who made an All-NBA team changed jerseys, but in regard to the two conferences, it would have been a pretty even swap \u2014 Kevin Durant for Kawhi Leonard \u2014 if both of those guys were healthy. There was some consolidation of stars \u2014 Leonard and Paul George, Durant and Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis and LeBron James, James Harden and Russell Westbrook \u2014 but we\u2019re left with three teams that employ three players that have made an All-NBA team in last five years. Two of those \u2014 Brooklyn and Golden State \u2014 will be missing one of their All-NBA guys for most (and maybe all) of the season. And for the third \u2014 the Lakers \u2014 one of the All-NBA guys (DeMarcus Cousins) has yet to return to form after his own injury. So things appear to be wide open in both conferences, though with Durant on the shelf, there\u2019s a clear top two teams in the East. And while both of those teams \u2014 the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 lost important pieces in free agency, they both still have young MVP candidates that will continue to get better. Given the size and talent in their starting lineup (and remembering how close they were to knocking off the eventual champs), there\u2019s a case for the Sixers as the best team in the East (and maybe the best team in the league if their young guys all show improvement). But Philly has a little more to prove than the Bucks, who still have the MVP and the league\u2019s No. 1 defense. For these mid-Summer rankings, we\u2019re looking at each conference separately and we\u2019ll have Western Conference rankings next Monday (July 29).

Some teams (Charlotte, Utah) still have roster spots to fill. Other teams (Memphis, Washington) still have some roster trimming to do. There are about 25 two-way-contract slots that can be filled around the league. And it\u2019s certainly possible that players like Chris Paul and Andre Iguodala will be traded a second time before the end of the summer. But it\u2019s already been a season of change. At the start of training camp last September, 15 of the league\u2019s 30 teams rosters were players who played at least 75 percent of the team\u2019s minutes in the previous season (2017-18). Right now \u2014 midway through July \u2014 only four teams are set to bring back players who played at least 75 percent of last season\u2019s minutes. Not every team has made big changes. The Denver Nuggets are set to return at least 12 of the 18 guys that played for them last season (the status of two-way, restricted free agent Brandon Goodwin is still in the air), along with Michael Porter Jr., who was with the team all season. The only players that have left the Nuggets \u2014 Tyler Lydon, Trey Lyles and Isaiah Thomas \u2014 played a total of eight minutes in the playoffs . Over the last three years, there has been a correlation between summer continuity and win increase the following season. But the correlation has been small. During that span, 33 teams have brought at least 75 percent of the previous season\u2019s minutes back, and only 15 of those 33 increased their win total. The highest individual return percentage of the stretch belonged to last season\u2019s Miami Heat, who brought back 97 percent of their minutes from 2017-18 \u2026 and proceeded to win five fewer games . This summer, the two biggest winners in free agency \u2014 the Brooklyn Nets and LA Clippers \u2014 rank 24th and 26th, respectively, by this measure (as of Wednesday morning). And while the Nuggets have a young core that can improve on its second-place finish in the West, the Orlando Magic are bringing back an ensemble that won just 42 games in the Eastern Conference, and the San Antonio Spurs have an older group that was ousted by Denver in the first round, albeit in seven games. Going forward, we\u2019ll be talking about totals gained or lost this summer. These were accumulated by non-rookies for any team last season. For example, in calculating the minutes that Indiana lost (and Milwaukee gained) with Wesley Matthews\u2019 departure, we\u2019re using all 2,091 minutes that Matthews played for Dallas and Indiana last season. That way, it\u2019s a more realistic measure of total production coming in and going out. In that regard, most teams have lost more \u201918-19 minutes than they\u2019ve gained. In total, there are more than 230 players who were on rosters (with two-way contracts included) at the end of the season and are either on a new team (via free agency or trades) or remain unsigned. More than half of those players (about 120) have been replaced by other non-rookies. About 70 more have been replaced by rookies (including those on two-way contracts). As an example, here\u2019s the roster math for the Golden State Warriors: The Warriors are one of 22 teams that have lost a group of players who played more minutes last season than the group of players that they\u2019ve added. There are a few teams that have added a lot more \u201918-19 minutes to their roster. That group is led by the New York Knicks , who have added almost 12,000 \u201918-19 minutes while seeing almost 9,000 minutes exit. The Knicks have lost four guys \u2013 Mario Hezonja, DeAndre Jordan, Emmanuel Mudiay and Noah Vonleh \u2013 who played at least 1,000 minutes. They added seven, and all seven started at least 28 games last season. Of course, how many of those seven are difference makers is up for debate, as is the idea of whether the Knicks should have used at least some of their cap space to take on bad contracts \u2014 often spiced up with future picks \u2014 from other teams. The Nets lost as many players (6) who played at least 1,000 minutes last season as they gained. But they added four of the 31 2,000-minute players to have changed teams this summer, most notably in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Utah (3) is the only other team with more than two additions that played at least 2,000 minutes last season. The eight guys that Brooklyn brought in started a total of 363 games in \u201918-19, while the nine guys they lost started just 179. That\u2019s the biggest increase, with New York (+100) and Utah (+84) also seeing differentials of more than 82 games. The Sacramento Kings lost two guys that played at least 1,000 minutes last season, and one of those guys \u2014 Alec Burks \u2014 played only 127 minutes for the Kings. They added four 1,000-minute players, including two \u2013 Trevor Ariza and Cory Joseph \u2014 that played more than 2,000 minutes last season. As noted above, the Nuggets lead the league in continuity, bringing back all 10 guys that played more than 1,120 minutes for them last season. But they\u2019ve also added Jerami Grant, who played 2,612 minutes for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Though they\u2019ve added more players (11, including four rookies) than they\u2019ve lost (nine) and need to trim their roster between now and opening night, the Washington Wizards are set to see the biggest discrepancy in regard to \u201918-19 minutes. They\u2019ve lost more than 11,000 (with Trevor Ariza, Jeff Green and Tomas Satoransky accounting for more than half of that total) and added less than 5,000. The group of players that the Wizards lost also started 208 more \u201918-19 games than the players added \u2014 the biggest discrepancy in that regard. The Charlotte Hornets not only lost more than 1,000 \u201918-19 minutes in their Kemba Walker-Terry Rozier swap, they also lost three other guys \u2013 Jeremy Lamb, Shelvin Mack and Tony Parker \u2013 who played more than 1,000 minutes last season. There\u2019s a general consensus that the Indiana Pacers are in the \u201cwinners\u201d category this summer, adding Malcolm Brogdon, Jeremy Lamb and T.J. Warren. But they also lost five guys (four of their five playoff starters plus Cory Joseph) to have played at least 2,000 minutes last season. The only other teams who lost more than two 2,000-minute players were the the Clippers (3), Oklahoma City Thunder (3) and Wizards (3). Still available Most \u201918-19 minutes among still-available free agents\u2026 In regard to minutes played last season, the top 18 available free agents are all perimeter players (unless you want to count Jonas Jerebko as an interior guy). Among available non-perimeter players, Dante Cunningham (928), Cheick Diallo (896) and Zaza Pachulia (878) are the guys who played the most minutes last season. Putting the ball in the basket is the most important thing in the NBA, and every team is always on the hunt for more shooting. But in regard to \u201918-19 3-pointers, half of the league (15 teams) has lost more than it\u2019s gained. There are a few teams to have seen big increases, however. The Knicks added Reggie Bullock (148-for-393, 37.7 percent), Marcus Morris (146-for-389, 37.5 percent) and Wayne Ellington (138-for-372, 37.1 percent), though creating open shots for those guys might be an issue. None of the six players that the Kings have lost made more than 61 3-pointers last season. Ariza (145) is the big gain in that regard, but they also added Dewayne Dedmon, a big man who shot 38 percent on 217 attempts from beyond the arc. On the other end of the spectrum, it\u2019s the Hornets that lost the most 3s, with Walker having ranked fifth in the league in total makes . The Atlanta Hawks ranked fourth in the percentage of their shots that were 3-pointers, but traded Taurean Prince ( 39 percent on 315 attempts ), lost Dedmon, haven\u2019t re-signed Vince Carter (39 percent on 316 attempts) and swapped Kent Bazemore (32 percent; 300 attempts) for Evan Turner (21 percent; 52 attempts). The Toronto Raptors , meanwhile, haven\u2019t really replaced two of the four guys who made more than 100 threes for them last season. Still available Most \u201918-19 3-pointers among still-available free agents\u2026 J.R. Smith, waived by the Cavs on Monday, made 143 threes (shooting 37.5 percent) in 2017-18, but played just 11 games last season. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Kemba Walker will try to replace him. Kyrie Irving is no longer with the Celtics, but his brief flameout in Boston is still on the minds of fans in the city and even, apparently, players who have yet to play a minute for the team. On the day that the Celtics introduced Walker as their point guard of the future, Kanter said he chose the No. 11 last worn in Boston by Irving in part because it was his number in Oklahoma City in 2016-17. But he also quoted a commercial in which Irving aspired to have the number retired in his honor. \u201cI want to be the reason no one else wears it,\u201d Kanter said, cracking up himself and the media at the introductory news conference he shared with Walker. \u201cI had to say it.\u201d Irving was the Celtics\u2019 big free agency splash two summers ago, when he asked the Cleveland Cavaliers to trade him and they shipped him to Boston for the immensely popular Isaiah Thomas. The Celtics, who had just lost to Cleveland in the conference finals, returned to the East finals the next year \u2014 when Irving was injured \u2014 but bowed out in the second round this season, when he was healthy. General manager Danny Ainge took pains to stress that he doesn\u2019t blame Irving for the team\u2019s disappointing season. \u201cThe last point guard, it didn\u2019t end like we wanted this year, but it certainly wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Ainge said. Irving, who had spoken about his desire to finish his career in Boston \u2014 and have his number retired \u2014 opted out of his contract and signed with the Brooklyn Nets. Fans were mostly glad to see him go, and Walker played along on Wednesday, joking with a reporter about the Earth being flat \u2014 a reference to another famous Irving comment. Al Horford also jumped ship, meaning the Celtics had lost their biggest acquisition from two of the last three offseasons. Instead of adding role players to make another run at an 18th NBA title, they needed replacements for their stars. But coach Brad Stevens said he never spent any time worrying about whether the roster was in need of a multi-season rebuild. \u201cWe always go through every scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody was looking at what we weren\u2019t going to be. We don\u2019t ever look at it that way.\u201d That\u2019s when Ainge went to work. Walker was signed to a four-year, $141 million deal \u2014 the most Boston could offer, but $80 million less than the Charlotte Hornets could have paid him over five seasons. (The Celtics also announced on Wednesday that they have re-signed forward Daniel Theis and guard Brad Wanamaker.) \u201cThis was our Plan A,\u201d Ainge said, sitting between Walker and Kanter for the news conference at the team\u2019s practice facility. \u201cGetting Kemba was a top priority in free agency.\u201d Walker won the NCAA championship at UConn, beating Stevens\u2019 Butler team in the 2011 title game. He referred to the championship banners hanging from the ceiling at the Auerbach Center, and the new Boston Garden, and said he hoped to have a chance to win again after reaching the playoffs just twice, losing in the first round both times, in eight seasons with the Hornets. \u201cCharlotte is all I\u2019ve known,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all came down to my happiness and how I want to compete night in and night out. My time was up there. I\u2019m ready to start a new chapter.\u201d Ainge wasted no time \u2014 even before Walker agreed to a deal \u2014 putting him to work. The GM handed Walker his phone so he could help recruit Kanter. It worked. \u201cThat made me very excited,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cAn All-Star guy, a superstar, calling me and saying he wants me to be here. That made me feel very special.

Through those conversations we came to the understanding that looking at some alternative situations would be something that made sense for him. As a result, and due to his history with the Thunder, we worked together to accommodate this,\u201d said Presti. \u201cOur ability to have these types of conversations and work so closely with Russell and his agent Thad Foucher is only possible because of the depth of the relationship that has been built over the last 11 years. \u201cRussell Westbrook is the most important player in the brief history of the Oklahoma City Thunder. He has left an indelible mark on this team, city and state. None of us could have anticipated the player he has become, and we are all deeply proud of what he has contributed to the success of the franchise and to our community.

The team said it was a multiyear deal . Oubre was acquired in a trade with the Washington Wizards for veteran Trevor Ariza last December. He averaged 16.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in 40 games with the Suns to go with his energy on defense. The four-year pro led the NBA in steals per game with 2.1 after the All-Star break, to go with 20.2 points and 5.7 rebounds. \u201cRight now I\u2019m a Phoenix Sun, and I\u2019m excited to get better every day with the group of guys that we have,\u201d the 23-year-old Oubre said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m super excited about where we\u2019re going and where we\u2019re going to be. The sky\u2019s the limit for us. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d he added. \u201cYou see how my game evolved when I got here and it happened the right way. Nothing was given to me.\u201d Oubre returns to a new-look roster that includes star Devin Booker and second-year center Deandre Ayton, plus point guard Ricky Rubio. The Suns also added power forward Dario Saric and center Aron Baynes via trades, and drafted Cameron Johnson with the 11th overall pick last month. \u201cWe added at the positions of need for us, point guard and power forward,\u201d Suns general manager James Jones said. \u201cAnd we kept our core guys intact. I think you had a glimpse of what we can become at the end of last season. Kelly was a big reason for our turnaround. We\u2019re just excited to have him back with us.\u201d The Suns made it a priority to retain Oubre, who became a fan favorite for his hustling style of play and all-around game in what was another down season. The Suns went 19-63 last season and haven\u2019t finished above .500 since 2013-14. Phoenix won five of seven games during a stretch from Feb. 25 to March 10 last season, which included wins over the Los Angeles Lakers, Central Division champion Milwaukee Bucks and the Golden State Warriors. Oubre had 27 points and 13 rebounds in the 114-105 win over the Bucks on March 4, but underwent a minor thumb procedure on March 22 and didn\u2019t play the rest of the season. \u201cDefensively he\u2019s one of the guys in the league that fits today\u2019s game and even past eras of basketball,\u201d new Suns head coach Monty Williams said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s a level of comfort to have somebody who has experience but still has room to improve.\u201d Oubre and Ayton came up with \u201cValley Boyz\u201d, a name they gave themselves and their teammates that has caught on via social media with Suns fans. He\u2019s since trademarked the phrase and hopes the brand can continue to rally support for the team. \u201cIt\u2019s a family. It\u2019s going to grow organically,\u201d Oubre said. \u201cI can\u2019t force it to grow. It\u2019s been a beautiful thing to see, man, because that\u2019s the whole city of Phoenix.\u201d Williams said Rubio\u2019s job will be to manage the game from the point guard spot. The veteran from Spain started his career with the Minnesota Timberwolves and spent the past two seasons with the Utah Jazz. \u201cWe have a guy in Ricky that\u2019s going to make everybody more efficient than they have been,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen we get stops, I don\u2019t want to have to call plays, and I think when you have a point guard like Ricky and guys like Kelly who can get out and run and make plays, that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to allow me more freedom to sit back and let the guys develop our culture offensively."},{"id":32531,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-york-knicks-reggie-bullock-marcus-morris-official-release","date":"2019-07-16","title":"Knicks agree to deals with Reggie Bullock, Marcus Morris","content":" NEW YORK \u2013 The New York Knicks announced today that the team has signed guard-forward Reggie Bullock and forward Marcus Morris.

And Myers doesn\u2019t think he would do anything differently in an attempt to keep Durant, who told Myers he was ready for a new chapter after winning championships with the Warriors in 2017 and \u201918 as NBA Finals MVP both years. \u201cYou do the best you can,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI think all along, to me it was a blessing that he came, that he wanted to be a part of this. This is a guy who can move in whatever direction he wants because of his talent. He came and he delivered. In my opinion he was everything we could have asked for. He represented us on the court, he represented us off the court. He still has a great relationship with a lot of his teammates, our staff, our coaching staff, myself. He just wanted to try something new, and that\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t look back and say, \u2018If this or that,\u2019 I don\u2019t feel that way.\u201d Myers sat down with Durant for a lengthy conversation \u2014 chatting for an hour or two about life and other matters \u2014 in New York ahead of Durant\u2019s Instagram announcement on June 30 that he would sign with the Nets on a max contract. Durant is likely to miss a year as he recovers from surgery on a ruptured right Achilles tendon he hurt in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, which the Warriors lost in six games to the Toronto Raptors. \u201cI talked to him until I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to him a few days later,\u201d Myers said with a chuckle, recalling how regularly they had discussions during Durant\u2019s three years in the Bay Area. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like slamming the door. To be honest I was kind of sad, I was, because I like him. The other thing is, I love basketball, so just to watch him play was a treat for me, just to watch him practice, to watch him work out. \u2026 I\u2019ll miss that, I will, just as a basketball fan because guys like him don\u2019t come along too often. \u201cI got to see him up close for three years of my life, and I\u2019ll always remember that.\u201d Now, Golden State will go forward with a new-look roster featuring just a few of the old regulars: Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, then Klay Thompson sometime next year once he is healthy and recovered from knee surgery. Myers hasn\u2019t visited Thompson in Los Angeles since his July 2 surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee but plans to now that the roster is taking shape and nearly complete after the frenzy that was the start of free agency. Gone from Golden State are 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala and key reserve Shaun Livingston, while the Warriors brought back big man Kevon Looney. The Warriors acquired shooting guards D\u2019Angelo Russell, Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III to help take on some of the scoring load lost without Durant and Thompson and center Willie Cauley-Stein. Even the coaching staff will adjust roles to focus more on player development, with Steve Kerr still working out those details. Defensive guru Ron Adams will not have the exact same job description going forward, Myers said. And Myers isn\u2019t about to make any bold predictions about how this young team will do in an even more powerful Western Conference, especially without Thompson for much of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s a new dawn for us, but it\u2019s OK. We haven\u2019t been in this position for five years,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be easy.

Smith\u2019s never-a-dull-moment run with the Cavaliers is over. Cleveland released the colorful shooting guard Monday before his $15.6 million contract for next season became guaranteed. The Cavs had been trying to trade Smith for months, but the team was unable to find the right deal even after he agreed to extend his guarantee date from June 30 to July 15. By waiving Smith, the Cavaliers will open salary-cap space and will move under the luxury tax threshold for next season. The 33-year-old played in just 11 games last season after he stepped away from the team in hopes of being traded or released. It was a mutual decision because he wasn\u2019t happy with his role and the Cavaliers didn\u2019t want him to be a negative influence on their young players. Once he clears waivers, Smith will be a free agent and can sign anywhere. Last week, Smith said he wasn\u2019t finished playing and smiled when asked if it\u2019s been strange not being part of a team for the past eight months. \u201cTechnically my whole career\u2019s been in limbo, so this is easy for me,\u201d he said before playing in the All-Star Celebrity Softball Game. Smith\u2019s release ends an interesting tenure with the Cavaliers, who acquired him in a trade from the New York Knicks in 2015. He was both loved and loathed by Cleveland fans, who were never quite sure what he might do on or off the floor. One of the NBA\u2019s most accurate 3-point shooters, Smith played a vital part in Cleveland winning the 2016 championship, ending a 52-year title drought for the city\u2019s three major sports teams. Smith made two 3-pointers during a critical stretch of Game 7 of the Finals, helping the Cavaliers complete a historic comeback from a 3-1 series deficit to dethrone the Golden State Warriors. A few days after the team\u2019s victory, Smith further endeared himself to Cleveland fans by going shirtless and exposing his numerous tattoos while riding in the Cavs\u2019 celebratory parade through downtown. Smith will also be remembered for a gaffe in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals. In the closing seconds, he grabbed an offensive rebound after a missed foul shot and dribbled out the clock to end regulation, thinking the Cavs were ahead. The game was tied, and Cleveland lost in overtime on the way to being swept in four straight games by the Warriors. Smith knows some fans won\u2019t forgive him, but there are others who appreciate his quirkiness. Cleveland will always be special. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the more stress relievers is being able to feel wanted, even if it\u2019s not by the organization, it\u2019s the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s bigger to me than anything. The people who spent their hard-earned money to come cheer for you, root for you.\u201d A father of four daughters, Smith said he hopes to be picked up by another team. But if not, he has no regrets. \u201cI live a good life,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to be stressed or be dissatisfied. I\u2019ve got four amazing kids. I went through one of the toughest parts of my life with my (premature) daughter. This is easy. This is a cakewalk. Just stay in shape and stay ready to play basketball when I\u2019m called.

The max deal is the latest big commitment by a team expected to make a serious push at its first NBA championship since 1983. Simmons, 22, will make about $8.1 million this season, the last of his four-year rookie deal. His salary for the next season will jump to about $29.3 million and rise to nearly $39 million in 2024-25, according to the person who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday because the contract is not official. The deal solidifies the 76ers\u2019 core for the next few seasons. All-Star Joel Embiid and Al Horford are under contract though 2023, Tobias Harris through 2024 and now Simmons through 2025. Horford got a $109 million, four-year deal and Embiid agreed last season to a $147 million, five-year deal. Sixers general manager Elton Brand had until the middle of October to reach a max deal with Simmons but wasted little time in locking up another cornerstone player. Simmons was the No. 1 overall draft pick in the 2016. He made his NBA debut in the 2017-18 season and was Rookie of the Year. He was an All-Star for the first time last season. He has averaged 16.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.9 assists in his two seasons. \u201cI think I want to work on everything and continue to let my game grow,\u201d Simmons said at the end of the season. \u201cI think the one thing I got a lot better at this season was leadership.\u201d The Sixers were knocked out of the Eastern Conference semifinals for the second straight season. Philadelphia is 101-58 in regular-season games when Simmons plays. He has had 22 triple-doubles in the last two seasons, tied for third most in the league with Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and trailing Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook (59) and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James (26). Simmons also has had 80 double-doubles over the last two seasons. But he missed all 11 3-point attempts his rookie season and was 0 for 6 last season, a combination of an awkward shooting form and a hesitancy to keep shooting shots he can\u2019t make.

I think I am at 60 percent of my potential, as good as I can be. I just want to be better.

With Antetokounmpo leading the way, Milwaukee won an NBA-best 60 games and started the playoffs 10-1 before losing four straight games to the Toronto Raptors in the East finals . If Antetokounmpo had his way, the Bucks would have had a chance to redeem themselves against Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors this upcoming season. But that won\u2019t be possible after Leonard decided to sign with the LA Clippers this summer. \u201cFor me personally, I would [have loved] for Kawhi to stay in the East and stay in Toronto because I would love to go through the series [with them] again,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cBut unfortunately, this is the NBA we are talking about. Moves happen. People change teams. But we got an opportunity right now. We got to take advantage of it, and hopefully we can seize the opportunity and make big things happen.\u201d The 2019-20 season will be critical for the Bucks as Antetokounmpo is eligible to sign a super-max extension with the team next summer. Antetokounmpo has been clear that contending for championships is his biggest goal and he sees no reason to do it with a city other than Milwaukee. \u201cMy goal is going to stay the same: It\u2019s get better, take it day by day, step by step, and the ultimate goal is to win a championship,\u201d Antetokounmpo told ESPN . \u201cAs long as that we are all on the same page and we are all focused on that goal, why not play for the Bucks 20 years, why not play 25 years? Why not, after playing, be a member of the coaching staff or a member of the front office? But we got to have the same goal. We got to have the same principles. \u2026 We got to focus on winning a championship. \u201cI want to be a part of a winning team,\u201d Antetokounmpo continued. \u201cAs long as we have the same mindset and same approach to the game, there\u2019s no reason for me to move and not be like Steph [Curry], not like be like Dirk [Nowitzki] or Kobe [Bryant] or Tim Duncan.\u201d The city of Milwaukee honored Antetokounmpo with a celebration for his MVP award on Sunday. The Bucks retained All-Star Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and George Hill in free agency this offseason and added Robin Lopez, Wesley Matthews and Thanasis Antetokounmpo \u2014 the eldest of the family, who has played professionally in Greece for the past two seasons.

In a seven-game series, we\u2019ll come out first.\u201d These are words to live by for a team that failed to coax Kawhi Leonard aboard this summer and will put plenty of faith in a roster otherwise loaded with aging veterans. They must also eventually deal with the noise sure to be generated by the Clippers, their lightly-decorated co-tenant at Staples who are thirsty for an L.A. overthrow. The Clippers did manage to snare Kawhi and shockingly added Paul George, giving them a deeper talent pool than the Lakers. Plus, the ripple effect caused by free agency and trade demands created uprisings in Utah and Houston, not to mention improving forces in the more stable teams in Denver and Portland. But this is about the Lakers today and how they\u2019re ready to separate themselves from a sloppy start with LeBron last season by giving him arguably the best teammate he\u2019s ever had, someone who might even be better than LeBron at this latter stage of his career. About Davis, who\u2019s just 26, Pelinka said something that won\u2019t get much blowback: \u201cHe\u2019s the most dominant young basketball player in the world \u2026 his dedication to his craft is unparalleled. There is no more complete player in the game. There\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t do. He can shoot. He can make plays. He can defend 1 through 5. He can protect the rim. He can handle the ball.\u201d Yes, he can indeed do all of that, as he showed during seven years in New Orleans, where he made the All-NBA first team three times and led the league in blocks per game three times while averaging 23.7 points. Davis, at 6-foot-10, is a nightmare matchup for bigs who lack his agility and shooting range, as well as forwards who struggle against Davis\u2019 force in the paint and delicate touch at the rim. Although he has never won the Kia MVP award, Davis is MVP-caliber and best of all for the Lakers, is still in his prime and itching to finally play on a contender for a change. But here\u2019s where Davis has fallen short: He never took the Pelicans anywhere special in the postseason, and in five of his seven seasons he played 68 games or less because of health issues. If Davis is such a singular force, why hasn\u2019t he been able to duplicate what other great players \u2014 Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas and Kawhi in Toronto, to mention a pair \u2014 have done without a strong co-star? Davis\u2019 teams made the playoffs only twice and went beyond the first round just once. No question, he is a superior player, but there are major questions as to whether he makes teammates better. The lack-of-help excuse is no longer with Davis in L.A. He has LeBron, who turns 35 next season but will surely snort fire as he returns from the double indignity of injury and sitting out the playoffs. Whether the pressure on LeBron to prove himself is real or imagined, he\u2019ll use it for motivation. Plus, he has an impressive sidekick. That, and a ticking basketball biological clock, should be enough for LeBron to make this work. Davis has shown he can be one of the more accommodating stars in the league, his ego checked at the jump circle. That\u2019s why there are few red flags flapping with regard to LeBron and Davis compared to, say, Russell Westbrook and James Harden, the new double-scoop flavor in Houston. \u201cBoth are going to command double teams,\u201d said new head coach Frank Vogel. \u201cTo have that second star to be the counter-punch is going to complement each other.\u201d Davis said the chance to play alongside LeBron is \u201cpretty amazing,\u201d which is evidently not something that Kawhi said to himself, nor did Kevin Durant and George, both of whom turned down chances to align with LeBron over the last few years as free agents. There\u2019s also Kyle Kuzma, who was spared in the trade with New Orleans that brought Davis; Kuzma could flirt with All-Star status because he\u2019ll get plenty of open shots with Davis and LeBron commanding attention. The key, of course, is what the Lakers can possibly get while sifting through the supporting cast of DeMarcus Cousins, Rajon Rondo, Danny Green, JaVale McGee, Avery Bradley et al. If nothing else, the Lakers did address their desperate need for shooters and defenders, two very real problems last season that contributed (along with LeBron\u2019s injury) to a season that finished in the draft lottery. Pelinka called it a \u201cdeep, versatile roster\u201d as opposed to last season\u2019s cast, one that was created in part by former president Magic Johnson. As for the issue of health with Davis, it\u2019s real. He has sat with an assortment of shoulder and leg injuries throughout his entire career, though none proved serious, let alone career-threatening. When the trending topic of load management was raised, Davis was blunt. \u201cI\u2019m playing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 26 years old. I love the game of basketball. I\u2019m ready to play.\u201d Sitting next to him at the press conference, Vogel managed a smile and will ultimately have the final say there; with the hefty investment made in Davis, it\u2019ll be a shock if he even gets the chance to suit up in 70 games. Given Davis\u2019 bad luck with injuries and LeBron coming off a season where he played just 55 games, largely due to a groin strain, the Lakers will be extra cautious. There will be no push to win 65 games, even if they could, and there will be multiple times when James or Davis plays while the other sits. The lurking issue lies with Davis\u2019 future beyond this upcoming season. He has opted against signing an extension. Unless this changes, he will maintain flexibility and the power to decide his future when next summer arrives. But it will be a massive shock if Davis doesn\u2019t stick with the Lakers, or that the team didn\u2019t receive some assurances from him prior to sending a considerable package of No. 1 picks and young players to New Orleans. \u201cWe want a decade of dominance from him,\u201d said Pelinka. Take from that what you will. For now, it\u2019s all about the immediate future and the scent of a championship for a proud franchise that won only 37 games last season and hasn\u2019t made the playoffs in six years, an eternity for a team with 16 titles. \u201cMy goal is to bring a championship here,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWinning championships is the only goal.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

But to try to finally get over that title hump, the 76ers need more \u2014 they needed Horford. Horford could be the difference for the Sixers this season, not just because he\u2019s a four-time All-Star who can thrive as a low post defender and shoot the 3. It\u2019s because Horford can spell Embiid, the notoriously injury-prone franchise player, at center. The theory goes, keep Embiid fresh and healthy in the regular season, and watch him carry the Sixers through a dominant postseason. \u201cWe did fall off a cliff once Joel was off the court, especially defensively,\u201d GM Elton Brand said. Consider Game 6 in the Eastern Conference semifinals against Toronto: Embiid was a whopping plus-40, the highest plus-minus of his career. No Embiid, no chance. \u201cIt was a huge deficit last year and we corrected it,\u201d Brand said. Horford may have been off to the side on the dais at the 76ers\u2019 complex on Friday, but he\u2019s the centerpiece of a flurry of offseason deals that help them keep pace with Milwaukee, Boston and Brooklyn as top contenders in the East. Horford joined fellow newcomers Josh Richardson, Raul Neto and Kyle O\u2019Quinn at the complex along with returning free agents James Ennis III and Tobias Harris. Harris was one of two major in-season pickups last season and returned on a $180 million, five-year contract. The other? Well, Jimmy Butler, the clutch shooter in so many memorable postseason moments, was traded and signed a $142 million, four-year deal with the Miami Heat. Brand and team owner Josh Harris were diplomatic and thanked Butler for his contributions that led the Sixers to a Game 7 loss against eventual NBA champion Toronto in the East semis. Brand, though, refused to engage in a deep dive on why it didn\u2019t work out with Butler. \u201cI\u2019d make that trade again. He gave us a great playoff run last year,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI\u2019m not upset at all about that trade.\u201d Butler, JJ Redick and TJ McConnell \u2014 all key cogs in the Sixers\u2019 transformation from losers during \u201cThe Process\u201d to championship contenders \u2014 left this summer. But perhaps the Sixers might not have to look outside the organization to find another 3-point shooter. Perhaps they can get the occasional 3 from Simmons. Simmons was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft and wound up making his NBA debut in the 2017-18 season, earning Rookie of the Year honors. He was an All-Star for the first time last season and has averaged 16.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.9 assists in two seasons. He is also 0 for 17 on 3s. Simmons missed all 11 3-point attempts his rookie season and was 0 for 6 last season, a combination of an awkward shooting form and a hesitancy to keep shooting shots he can\u2019t make. Harris recently worked out with Simmons in Los Angeles and found him dedicated to improving his shot . \u201cEverybody was trying to figure out why I was guarding him at the 3-point line, but it was really because he hit two of them,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen I dared him to shoot two of them, he hit two in a row. That\u2019s why I was there. He\u2019s made big improvements on his game. His jump shot is looking really good and he has the confidence to shoot.\u201d Imagine: a healthy Embiid in April, a 3-point threat in Simmons and maybe a better shot at the championship. \u201cWe put in place the championship DNA, an elite team for years to come,\u201d Brand said."},{"id":32610,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/china-suns-summer-league-game-recap","date":"2019-07-13","title":"Game Recap: Suns 94, China 64","content":"Juan Carlos Blanco, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Phoenix Suns used a balanced offensive attack and stellar defense to notch a 94-64 win over Team China at Thomas & Mack Center in a Las Vegas Summer League consolation game Friday afternoon.

Earthquake again? Nope, just more Thunder. Oklahoma City and general manager Sam Presti were back at it, this time reportedly sending former Kia MVP Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for guard Chris Paul, first-round draft picks in 2024 and 2026, and pick swaps in 2021 and 2025. Six days earlier, OKC had stunned the pro hoops world by trading All-Star wing Paul George to the LA Clippers, serving up the co-star that coveted free agent Kawhi Leonard wanted as a condition of signing with Staples Center\u2019s other NBA team. That deal yielded for the Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari and guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, along with five first-round picks and swap rights on two more. The biggest difference in moving Westbrook was that this one was anticipated. George had gone to Presti quietly after conspiring with Leonard, requesting the trade in a way that enabled the OKC GM to work behind the scenes. Presti had leverage on the Clippers, since he in essence was delivering both two-way stars \u2013 George and Leonard, who otherwise might have re-signed with Toronto \u2013 simultaneously. The deal Thursday paired Presti with Rockets counterpart Daryl Morey. Given their trade-happy track records, it wasn\u2019t surprising that, if an NBA fan listened closely, he or she might have heard the sound of gods bowling.  George\u2019s departure and OKC\u2019s subsequent trade of forward Jerami Grant to Denver made it clear which direction the Thunder were heading. Getting ousted from the playoffs\u2019 first round for three consecutive years made the team\u2019s $146 million payroll (and the luxury taxes it triggered) untenable. \u201cPeople [within the league] knew they were going to do something pretty profound,\u201d one GM told NBA.com earlier this week. \u201cWhat they got for George was more than a king\u2019s ransom. And if they end up trading Russell for all the tea in China, it will be the same deal again, right?\u201d There were other suitors, most notably Miami, fueling speculation that Presti might not be done. How about Chris Paul to the Heat for expiring contracts, a prospect or two and more draft assets? As it is, the Thunder already have lassoed or retained an outrageous 15 first-round picks over the next six years. That sets up Oklahoma City ridiculously well, on paper, for the medium- and long-term. Short-term? Meh. A crew of Paul (if he stays), Gallinari, Gilgeous-Alexander, Andre Roberson, Steven Adams and Terrance Ferguson seems undermanned in the wild, wild West. But Presti has amassed enough picks that Thunder fans won\u2019t have to worry about their favorite team tanking \u2014 they can just root against the Clippers, the Heat and the Rockets in hopes of desirable draft positions. Westbrook deserves credit for spending the first 11 years of his career in an unglamorous, small-revenue market (though $168 million in NBA earnings had something to do with it too). He had two MVPs (Kevin Durant and James Harden) and one MVP candidate (George last season) leave via trade or free agency before he did.  Now he has a chance, re-teamed with Harden in Houston, to step into the void opened by Golden State\u2019s anticipated decline in 2019-20 (Durant\u2019s departure from the Bay has something to do with that). The Rockets and Morey have to be on the clock, their extended window as championship contenders not likely to stay propped open for long. Westbrook and Harden, a tandem of past MVPs, should have most of their statistical and usage itches scratched by now. Each badly needs a ring on his resume. Paul, meanwhile, might find himself hooking up with Jimmy Butler with the Heat, a pairing that makes more sense than Butler-Westbrook at least in terms of basketball compatibility. Presti\u2019s performance over the past 10 days or so has been \u201cbreathtaking,\u201d according to the rival GM. But with so many folks in and outside OKC so eager to spin the Thunder\u2019s picks and prospects forward, a nagging question remains: What should we make of their past? In Presti\u2019s 12 seasons, beginning with the franchise still in Seattle in 2007-08, his team has won 50 games or more six times (counting the 47-19 equivalent in lockout-shortened 2011-2012). Over the Thunder\u2019s first 10 seasons in Oklahoma, only the San Antonio Spurs won more often. The Thunder have reached the postseason nine times, winning 14 series. They lost the Finals in five games to Miami in 2012, and got bounced three times from the conference finals, once from the West semifinals and four times from the first round. There were injuries and close calls, sure, but those are a part of it for everyone. Drafting, Presti strung together Durant (No. 2 overall in 2007), Westbrook (No. 4, \u201908) and Harden (No. 3, \u201909). His record deeper into the first round has been predictably mixed: Reggie Jackson (No. 24, \u201911) and Adams (No. 12, \u201913) on one side of the ledger, fellows such as Perry Jones (No. 28, \u201912), Mitch McGary (No. 21, \u201914) and Cameron Payne (No. 14, \u201915) on the other. The Thunder\u2019s two most notable trades prior to this summer involved Harden going out and George coming in. When they sent out Harden \u2014 the league\u2019s reigning Kia Sixth Man of the Year award winner in 2012 \u2014 it was an anticipatory financial move that for a time kept them out of luxury tax trouble \u2026 as well as the Finals. When Presti traded for George in 2017, the players he gave up, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, had a better first season in Indiana than George in OKC. But as with Westbrook, Presti got George to sign a *cough* long-term extension, and the former Pacer finished third in MVP balloting this spring. So bottom line, which is it: Should the Thunder\u2019s extended run as a contender in the West be applauded? Or should they be considered underachievers, considering the three MVPs they had \u2013 Durant in 2014, Westbrook in 2017 and Harden (with Houston) in 2018 \u2013 as well as George? OKC got a total of 25 seasons from those four players, 23 of them in tandem or as a trio. Only Durant as a rookie and Westbrook in 2016-17 worked as a solo act, star-wise. Those two plus George made a total of 17 All-Star appearances while playing for the Thunder, and in seven of the past nine seasons, OKC sent two to the February gala. That\u2019s a lot of firepower for a fairly limited payoff (the lone Finals trip). So as excited as the Thunder and their fans might be for what\u2019s headed their way, they\u2019re right to feel melancholy over what\u2019s done and now gone. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And so does the Western Conference\u2019s seemingly never-ending game of \u201cCan you top this?\u201d Just one day after sending Paul George to the LA Clippers for an unprecedented haul of draft picks, the Oklahoma City Thunder have reportedly shipped 2017 Kia MVP Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets. Westbrook would reunite with former Thunder teammate James Harden, the 2018 MVP. Chris Paul and a package of first-round picks will be headed back to Oklahoma City, per a Thursday report by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Royce Young. Wojnarowski added that the picks would be first-rounders in 2024 and 2026, along with pick swaps in 2021 and 2025. The deal was reportedly completed with Westbrook\u2019s blessing as Thunder GM Sam Presti worked with the eight-time All-NBA point guard and his agent, Thad Foucher. Wojnarowski later clarified Houston attempted to direct Paul to a preferred third team , but couldn\u2019t connect the dot. Shams Charania of The Athletic subsequently broke down the protections: Westbrook, the only remaining player from the Thunder\u2019s first season in Oklahoma City after the franchise moved from Seattle in 2008, earned All-NBA Third Team recognition after logging his third consecutive season averaging a triple-double (this time: 22.9 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 10.7 apg). The 11-year veteran struggled with his shooting throughout, connecting on just 29.8 percent of his 3-point attempts and 42.8% overall, along with a career-worst 65.6 percent from the line. Given Westbrook\u2019s usage has soared in the years since Kevin Durant\u2019s departure to Golden State, the fit next to Harden will force both players to adjust . Harden\u2019s historic 2018-19 campaign included an exhilarating 32-game streak of 30-point games and the league\u2019s highest scoring average (36.1 ppg) since Michael Jordan put up 37.1 in 1986-87. The two players each ranked among the league\u2019s top four in touches per game and time of possession , as well as top 10 marks in average seconds per touch . Meanwhile, Paul dealt with his own struggles this season in Houston, his second with the Rockets following a six-year run with the \u201cLob City\u201d Clippers. Shooting a career-low 41.9 percent overall, Paul played in just 58 games for a second-straight season, recording his lowest usage rate (22.0) since 2012-13 while posting a career-high turnover ratio of 10.8 per 100 possessions. In the wake of Houston\u2019s second-round exit \u2014 yet again at the hands of the Warriors \u2014 reports began to circulate that Paul and Harden\u2019s relationship had frayed, culminating in a trade demand by Paul. Though denied aggressively by Paul and Rockets GM Daryl Morey at the time, Paul is on the move and Harden reportedly pushed for the deal once Westbrook\u2019s availability \u2014 and interest in Houston \u2014 became known. Westbrook and Harden were Thunder teammates for three seasons, the last of those in 2011-12 when that duo and Kevin Durant took Oklahoma City to the NBA Finals. They lost in five games to LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat, and Harden departed that summer for Houston \u2014 where he\u2019s been an All-Star ever since. The 34-year-old Paul is a nine-time All-Star, Westbrook an eight-time selection. Paul has 9,181 career assists, the most among active players. Westbrook has 138 triple-doubles, tied with Magic Johnson for second-most in NBA history behind only Oscar Robertson\u2019s 181. Paul is owed roughly $125 million over the final three years of his contract, including a $44.2 million option for 2021-22. Westbrook, who turns 31 early next season, is owed $171 million over the final four years of his existing deal.

But within the context of sports and certainly relative to its own offseason history, what the NBA just put itself, its principals and its fans through qualifies as nothing less than \u201c25 Days That Reshaped the League.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just what happened, though, that was profound. Star players relocating, general managers scrambling, media reports flying, owners exhausting their checkbooks, a dynasty punting, and old rivals recruiting new teammates. It wasn\u2019t merely the breakneck pace, though that was breathtaking. Kevin Durant shockingly went to the floor with a torn Achilles tendon on June 10, the date of Game 5 of The Finals at Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Arena. On July 5, just three-and-a-half weeks later, Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard announced he would be taking his trophies to southern California, specifically to the Los Angeles Clippers. And, oh yeah, All-Star wing Paul George of the Oklahoma City Thunder would be joining him. Twenty-five days from start to finish. That last maneuver even upstaged an earthquake that rattled the first night of the Las Vegas Summer League. \u201cWhat happened in that period of time was staggering in how it changed the league,\u201d said David Griffin, new vice president of the New Orleans Pelicans and far from an uninvolved bystander. \u201cYou look at what the Clippers were able to achieve and how quickly it all came together. They were put on the clock, what, 48 hours before they landed the plane? That\u2019s tough.\u201d Dallas owner Mark Cuban, ever the Maverick, questioned the premise. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d Cuban said. \u201c[The flurry of activity] was just the nature of how much capital there was.\u201d But Vlade Divac, the Sacramento Kings\u2019 chief basketball exec, exhaled when he considered \u201ca few of those moves\u2026\u201d \u201cIt definitely was interesting. Especially Kawhi, where and when he decided,\u201d Divac said. \u201cEverything was kind of stuck. Not just the NBA but the entire world was waiting to see where he was going to end up.\u201d This was bigger than just the bookends, though. Consider the headlines crammed in between Durant\u2019s injury and Leonard\u2019s decision, and the cumulative ramifications of them. 25 Days between Kevin Duran\u2019t injury (June 10) to Kawhi Leonard\u2019s move to LA (July 5): \u2022 Klay Thompson tears his ACL and, like Durant, will miss much or all of 2019-20. \u2022 Led by Leonard, the Raptors finally bring an NBA championship to Canada. \u2022 Pelicans big man Anthony Davis gets the trade he\u2019d lobbied for, going to the Los Angeles Lakers to play alongside LeBron James. \u2022 Zion Williamson, the mostly highly touted prospect since Davis or maybe James, gets drafted No. 1 by New Orleans. \u2022 Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo stakes a claim on the \u201cNBA\u2019s best player\u201d title as the league\u2019s 2019 Most Valuable Player. \u2022 Durant and All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving leave the Warriors and the Celtics, respectively, to team up in Brooklyn. \u2022 The Utah Jazz add both Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic, rock-solid acquisitions for a team amped by the NBA\u2019s newfound parity. \u2022 Jimmy Butler moves via sign-and-trade to the Miami Heat, parting ways with a Philadelphia team he led through two playoff rounds. \u2022\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b But the Sixers fire back, re-signing Tobias Harris, luring Al Horford out of Boston and getting Josh Richardson in the Butler deal. \u2022\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Golden State \u2013 remember them? \u2013 snatches D\u2019Angelo Russell from Minnesota\u2019s grasp and adds Willie Cauley-Stein. \u2022\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b The earthquake hits the Vegas summer league, shutting down the games and sending spectators into the night. \u2022\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Then came the Kawhi Bomb, with George as a startling co-star. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSeriously, that\u2019s enough news and change to carry most sports leagues through an entire calendar year. Yet the NBA burned through those storylines in less than a month. It\u2019s the latest, greatest (in magnitude at least) example of this pro basketball enterprise\u2019s ambitions for global domination, while bigfooting every other sport\u2019s air-time and Web clicks. To some, the frenzy to sign free agents, backfill with replacements and build or rebuild on the fly looked panicked, even unstable. A fan who followed a favorite player\u2019s exploits for a few years unexpectedly faces a choice: switch your allegiance to the player\u2019s new team or re-imagine him from friend to foe by October. It\u2019s the NBA as a full-sized, flesh-and-blood fantasy league. To others, all of this is a natural result of the system negotiated by the teams and the players in their collective bargaining agreement, along with a further shift in power from owners to players as the demand for talent outstrips supply. And then there are the \u201cpotential\u201d junkies, the sort of sports fans who get more excited by signings and trades than they do by the games themselves. Social media has only dialed up the sense of NBA summer as short-attention-span theater. \u201cWhat we\u2019re realizing,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday, \u201cwas that it\u2019s less about pointing fingers. It\u2019s that the world has changed, and in part we\u2019re the victims of our own success. We never used to have this kind of coverage in the offseason. We never used to have this kind of attention to summer league basketball. And as I say, the 24\/7 attention on free agency creates new pressures.\u201d It\u2019s the CBA itself that creates the free agents, though. When the current agreement with the players was negotiated, teams pressed for shorter contracts to save them from debilitating injuries and flawed business decisions. Well, shorter deals mean more players hitting the market sooner and more often, freeing up more salary-cap space in the process. \u201cThey created the conditions for more movement,\u201d one former team executive said this week. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing that. And there were so many big names out there this summer, which hasn\u2019t happened often. In 2016, there was more money [from a flood of TV rights fees] but there weren\u2019t as many blockbuster names.\u201d Said Silver: \u201c[Shorter contracts] create more of a sense of urgency with players. It creates greater incentives for performance. \u2026 We didn\u2019t do it to create more interest in the offseason, but obviously it\u2019s created extraordinary media interest and fan interest. For the most part, that\u2019s been something that\u2019s positive.\u201d The NBA sees the hyperactivity in June and July as a net gain, with an audience excited by the comings and goings greater than however many people might be turned off by the dollar amounts tossed around or the vast game of market musical chairs. Still, there are downsides. Leonard\u2019s move to L.A. might have given some Toronto fans the bends, taking them from the euphoria of the franchise\u2019s first title in its 24-year existence, then plunging them to traumatic emotional depths with his departure. \u201cThink about what it means if you\u2019re Toronto,\u201d one NBA GM said. \u201cYou built a championship team \u2013 and that didn\u2019t matter. He wanted to leave. What do you do? Literally, what\u2019s the answer? It\u2019s not championships. It\u2019s not maintaining their health. They have all the power.\u201d Then there are the folks in OKC, minding their own business before Leonard\u2019s pitch to George prompted the Thunder player to suddenly ask to be traded. \u201cThere are always those unintended consequences, right?\u201d the former exec said. \u201cThe teams wanted shorter contracts but this is the flip side of that \u2013 you can\u2019t lock guys in either. \u201cIf a guy\u2019s on a six-year deal and demands to be traded after two, it\u2019s more like, \u2018Haha! Sure.\u2019 But when they start having leverage is when they get closer to the expiration.\u201d Said a GM: \u201cUnfortunately free agency now exists even for players under contract.\u201d Davis got close enough with the Pelicans to join James \u2013 with whom he also shares an agent, Rich Paul \u2013 on the Lakers. George was close enough, too, given reality that OKC was carrying an exorbitant payroll, paying massive luxury taxes and not advancing past the playoffs\u2019 first round. One rival GM said it was an open secret that the Thunder\u2019s Sam Presti was going to make one or more significant roster moves this summer. He still might, based on the speculation about former MVP Russell Westbrook\u2019s future whereabouts. Westbrook\u2019s contract won\u2019t make it easy \u2013 he has four seasons left on the five-year, $205 million extension he signed in 2017, plus a 15 percent trade kicker \u2013 but most league insiders expect him to be moved either soon or during the season. So yeah, Westbrook muddies the time frame of \u201c25 days\u201d a bit, as did Boogie Cousins\u2019 and Rajon Rondo\u2019s deals on day 26 to play for the Lakers. There were other lesser lights who signed, and then this week\u2019s wrinkle in which forward Marcus Morris changed his mind on the verbal assurance he gave San Antonio to pursue a deal with New York. It\u2019s no secret, either, the June 30 starting gun for free agency is only the \u201cofficial\u201d start. No one is being prosecuted for it via tampering fines, but it\u2019s clear there is lots of communication between players, between teams and agents and in every other direction long before deals even leak on Twitter. We\u2019ll stick with June 10 as the start of this madness, though, because of the impact of Durant\u2019s injury on Golden State. Losing both him and Thompson seemed to many as if the Warriors \u2013 truly on the second tier of NBA dynasties with Chicago and San Antonio \u2013 had stepped into an elevator shaft. Eventually their run of five Finals and three titles was going to end. But like that ? Now the entire league is feeling an openness that the Eastern Conference felt a year ago, after LeBron James moved west and took his stranglehold of Finals appearances with him. There either is no favorite in the West or there are a half dozen of them. In the East, the top teams have definitely changed, without any guarantees they\u2019ve gotten better. \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s always open,\u201d said Divac, whose Kings want in on some of the lofty aspirations too. \u201cDefinitely it was unfortunate for Golden State \u2013 you never want to have those kind of injuries that shake not just the players, [but] the entire organization and send it a different way. But that\u2019s part of the game.\u201d Said the former team executive: \u201cI do see more parity. It is a lot more wide-open. It reminds me of the 2015 season, the first year Golden State won, where there were five or six in Western Conference that felt they were neck-and-neck.\u201d Asked to name the biggest surprise of the summer so far, several of those interviewed said George\u2019s move to the Clippers, more so than Leonard\u2019s. One insider cited Butler going to Miami, assuming the aggressive All-Star wing wants to be alpha dog on his own team more than a supporting player to Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Another GM said it was Durant and Irving teaming up to sign with the Nets. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re meant to be together in personality or emotionally,\u201d he opined. Almost everybody was surprised by the earthquake that grabbed center stage Friday night, a 7.1 on the Richter scale that started the scoreboard swaying at the Thomas & Mack Center and had courtside fans nervously eyeing the loudspeakers overhead. In the long run, though, in magnitude registered, tremors delivered and aftershocks felt, that shaker might have nothing on the NBA\u2019s tumultuous 25 days. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Congratulations to Coach Bertka on this prestigious recognition.\u201d \u201cI am honored and proud to have been selected for the Tex Winter Assistant Coach Lifetime Impact Award by a committee of my coaching peers, said Coach Bill Bertka.\u201d \u201cI am sincerely grateful to the National Basketball Coaches Association for this recognition.\u201d Bertka began his NBA career in 1968 when the Los Angeles Lakers hired him to scout college players for the NBA Draft, making him the first full-time scout in league history. He and his wife, Solveig, had started a college scouting service in the mid-60s and it grew to become an industry leader before shuttering in 1991. Under Head Coach Bill Sharman, Bertka began working with players while also adding advance scouting duties. In 1974 Bertka left the Lakers to become the first General Manager of the New Orleans Jazz. He also served as a Jazz assistant coach under Elgin Baylor. In 1981 when Pat Riley became Head Coach, he brought Bertka back to the Lakers as his first Assistant, and Bertka has worked for the Lakers ever since, as an Assistant Coach, Director of Scouting, Special Assistant to the General Manager and Basketball Consultant. All told, 45 of his 52 years in the NBA have been with the Lakers. He has worked with 17 different Lakers Head Coaches and has coached greats from Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson to Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant and beyond. He has ten NBA Championship rings and his teams made a total of 20 trips to the NBA Finals. Prior to the NBA, Bertka was a Head Coach at three different colleges, including a four-year stint at his alma mater, Kent State. Bertka, who will turn 92 on August 8, has been inducted into the Santa Barbara Sports Hall of Fame (1989), the Summit County (OH) Sports Hall of Fame (1989), the Kent State University Sports Hall of Fame, (2004) and the Santa Barbara Basketball Court of Champions (2014). \u201cAssistant Coaches often operate behind the scenes and may not receive public recognition for their team\u2019s success. However, if you ask any Head Coach, they would say that their team could not operate without the hard work of these men and women,\u201d said National Basketball Coaches Association Executive Director David S. Fogel. \u201cCoach Bertka certainly exemplifies these values on and off the court, and his tireless work ethic has led to successful seasons throughout his coaching career. Congratulations to Coach Bertka, this honor is well deserved.\u201d The National Basketball Coaches Association Tex Winter Lifetime Achievement Award honors the tremendous achievements and commitment of Hall of Famer Tex Winter, who over an outstanding NBA coaching career set a standard of integrity, competitive excellence, loyalty and tireless promotion of NBA basketball.

His textbook shooting form was on target all game as he scored 25 points with a pair of 3-pointers and added seven rebounds and five assists. While his 3-point shooting has been inconsistent, Herro has found ways to score in Summer League. Alize Johnson, Indiana Pacers Atlanta ran away with the win, but Johnson was a bright spot in Indiana\u2019s blowout loss. He finished with a double-double (18 points, 10 rebounds), marking his second consecutive such game in Summer League. The Pacers have to be pleased with the offensive development their 2018 second-round pick is showing. Anfernee Simons, Portland Trail Blazers Another day in Las Vegas, another 30-point game for Portland. Simons was electric against the Jazz, scoring 35 points (13-for-18 overall, 6-for-7 on 3-pointers) while also contributing in other areas. Like most rookies a season ago, Simons struggled on defense. But he came up with two steals and showed some improvement on that end. Tony Bradley, Utah Jazz  The second-year center has been a steady performer for the Jazz all summer and continued that against Portland. He came up clutch late with a pair of free throws to seal the win as he finished with 17 points and seven rebounds. The Jazz could use some frontcourt depth and Bradley could be making his case for more minutes this season. Brandon Goodwin, Denver Nuggets The second-year guard was perhaps the sole reason Denver was in the game against Boston. Goodwin\u2019s strategy of calling his own number paid off often as he scored 28 points in all manner of ways. He was particularly aggressive attacking the rim, nailing a couple of nice buckets in the paint over the Celtics\u2019 7-foot-7 fan favorite, Tacko Fall. Carsen Edwards, Boston Celtics Scoring was Edwards\u2019 forte as a star at Purdue and he showcased those abilities off the bench against the Nuggets. He dropped 23 points \u2014 and shot 5-for-7 on 3-pointers \u2014 and dazzled with his ballhandling, too. With Celtics boss Danny Ainge and coach Brad Stevens both watching at Cox Pavilion, Edwards showed out in a big way in the win. Chris Boucher & Malcolm Miller, Toronto Raptors Toronto has to be happy how its two young prospects fared win against the New York Knicks. Both of them had identical shooting performances (7-for-14) and both scored in double figures (19 for Miller; 23 for Boucher). Setting an aggressive tone for the Raptors, they combined for 15 rebounds while Boucher added two blocks. Chris Clemons, Houston Rockets An undrafted rookie, Clemons showed off the shooting touch that made him a solid player in college. In fact, he shot better from 3-point range (6-for-11) than he did overall (6-for-15) against the Sacramento Kings. Houston\u2019s love of shooters is well known, and Clemons\u2019 showing with coach Mike D\u2019Antoni in the Cox Pavilion crowd should help his cause.

It also generated significant discussion among team management and NBA executives during the Board of Governors meeting Tuesday, and dominated the media session afterward with commissioner Adam Silver. The winners and losers of the frenetic player signings and movement won\u2019t be known until the 2019-20 season and beyond. That there were winners and losers, though, was known immediately as stars such as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard switched teams. Lots of the talk Tuesday focused on how those outcomes came about, and whether the rules served all of the constituents. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily see it as player versus owner,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhen we step back, what\u2019s best for the fan? I think what\u2019s best for the fan is a 30-team league which everyone has the opportunity to compete with a fair set of rules. I think to the extent that the balance of power is out of whack a little bit, we should address it.\u201d  Silver added: \u201cEven this notion of player power, what we\u2019re really talking about is a small group of players.\u201d There were and still are vast ripple effects, though, as second- and third-tier players sought deals or came up empty. Then there was the issue of the so-called moratorium, the period from June 30 to July 6 in which teams, players and their representatives are only supposed to talk and negotiate, without actually inking deals. That generally is viewed as a wink-wink proposition these days. Then there are team identification and continuity issues that arise when as many as 40 percent of the league\u2019s players hit free agency at the same time, as happened this summer. \u201cWe knew when we shortened contracts several years ago that the math [meant] you\u2019re going to have more free agency,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a two-edged sword. On one hand, it creates a sense of renewal in a lot of markets. It gives teams an opportunity to rebuild. But the downside, of course, is for other teams, they potentially lose players.\u201d While stating that he didn\u2019t want the league to overreact to one offseason, Silver did say they would explore rules that can be changed unilaterally, while identifying areas that need to be collectively bargained with the players. Another element of this offseason: For the second time in eight months, an MVP-caliber player with years left on his contract told management he wanted to be traded. In December, it was All-Star center Anthony Davis, whose demand and specific desire to land with the Los Angeles Lakers torpedoed the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 season. Last week, it was Oklahoma City wing Paul George abruptly asking out to join Leonard in a tandem move to the Los Angeles Clippers. While noting that trade demands are nothing new, Silver acknowledged: \u201cIt falls in the same category of issues of the so-called rule of law within a sports league. You have a contract and it needs to be meaningful on both sides. There\u2019s an expectation if you have a contract and it\u2019s guaranteed that the team is going to meet the terms of the contract, and the expectation on the other side is the player is going to meet the terms of the contract. \u201cTrade demands are disheartening. They\u2019re disheartening to the team. They\u2019re disheartening to the community and don\u2019t serve the player well. The players care about their reputations just as much. So that\u2019s an issue that needs to be addressed.\u201d Durant and Irving signed with Brooklyn, leaving Golden State and Boston, respectively. Leonard exited Toronto before the last scrap of confetti was gone from the Raptors\u2019 championship celebration. And though neither the Nets nor the Clippers historically have been free-agent magnets, the bottom line was big names heading to huge markets in New York and California. Next up? Milwaukee and its chances of convincing reigning Kia NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to sign a mega-deal extension next summer before he can test free agency in 2021. \u201cMy sense in the room today was that we\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same principles of fair balance of power and a sense that it\u2019s a level playing field. I think that\u2019s what teams want to know. \u201cMy job is to enforce a fair set of rules for all our teams and a set of rules that are clear and make sense for everyone. I think right now we\u2019re not quite there.\u201d Among other topics discussed by the Board of Governors Tuesday and\/or by Silver in his session with reporters: * Even the actual, nitty-gritty game-related news Tuesday \u2013 added opportunities for replay reviews \u2013 could be said to derive from the priority on fairness. Getting referees\u2019 calls right, despite grumbles about in-game delays, drove the addition for this season of a coach\u2019s challenge, as well as reviews triggered directly from the Replay Center in New Jersey. Similar to coaches\u2019 and managers\u2019 ability to request replay in NFL and MLB contests, each NBA team will be entitled to one challenge per game. A team can use it for the following instances: a called personal foul charged to that team; a called out-of-bounds violation, or a called goaltending or basket interference violation. A team must have a timeout available to issue a challenge. And no, there won\u2019t be a flag for each coach to toss as in football; a twirling of the finger, the signal referees currently use, will be sufficient. The challenge system has been in effect for two years in the NBA G League and during Summer League play this year. The Replay Center will initiate reviews immediately this season in deciding 2-point vs. 3-point shots and determining shot-clock violations. An additional courtside administrator will work at the scorer\u2019s table at each game to expedite communication between the game officials and the folks in Secaucus. * Television ratings in the playoffs, down compared to numbers reported in recent years, were not troubling to Silver. \u201cI do not believe, and the data doesn\u2019t support, that it\u2019s from declining interest,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe have other measurements of social media, fan support [and] attendance that demonstrate that, in fact, interest is growing. And certainly ratings, even conventional ratings, are growing outside of the United States.\u201d A generational shift away from traditional TV viewing, including \u201ccord-cutting,\u201d streaming and even pirating might be at work on NBA ratings. Silver said the changes in media options could mean talks and modifications with the broadcast partners, despite six years remaining on those agreements. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything endemic to the league,\u201d Silver said of the ratings data. \u201cIn fact, at our board meeting we discussed the growth in popularity of the sport, the growth in participation, the fact that we have a young, diverse, global audience. All very positive indicators.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .
