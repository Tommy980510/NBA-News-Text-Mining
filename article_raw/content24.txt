[{"id":34212,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-4-18-19","date":"2019-04-19","title":"About Last Night: White's revenge","content":" My, how the pendulum swings in playoff basketball. One game after being torched by Jamal Murray, who scored 22 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter in the Nuggets\u2019 Game 2 win over the Spurs, Derrick White showed up for Game 3 like a fire-breathing dragon. The result was a 118-108 home-court victory for the Spurs and a 2-1 series lead . \u201cDerrick White came out like he hadn\u2019t eaten in two days,\u201d said Nuggets coach Mike Malone, who was critical of his team\u2019s defense. \u201cDerrick White didn\u2019t even feel us,\u201d Malone added, who noted most of White\u2019s points came from drives in the paint. White poured in a career-high 36 points, added five rebounds and five assists, and attacked Murray and the Nuggets from the beginning. He was 15-of-21 from the field and 5-of-6 from the free-throw line. How good was White\u2019s night? During the regular season, the second-year point guard averaged 9.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists. \u201cHe was obviously spectacular \u2014 on both ends of the floor,\u201d said Spurs coach Greg Popovich. White added three steals and a blocked shot and only one turnover. By contrast, Murray put up only six shots and ended with six points. He also had four turnovers. TNT analyst Charles Barkley ragged Murray on the air for wearing an image of himself (part of an NBA Jam collage) after Game 2, in which he had caught fire late to lift the Nuggets to a 114-105 win . So, Murray showed up for tonight\u2019s game wearing a T-shirt with an image of Barkley emblazoned on the front. Chuck\u2019s response tonight was to guarantee the Nuggets were going to win Game 3. The kiss of death: a Charles Barkley guarantee. \ud83d\ude01 If you still doubt Ben Simmons\u2019 ability to impact a big game, you didn\u2019t witness Thursday night\u2019s Game 3. What started with bad news for Philadelphia \u2014 All-Star center Joel Embiid couldn\u2019t play after testing his sore knee in warmups \u2014 ended with the 76ers winning convincingly 131-115 after Boban Marjanovic fouled out. Who needs big front-court players when you\u2019ve got 6-foot-10 guard\/forward Ben Simmons to drive, and Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick to shoot from the edge? Simmons finished with a career playoff-high 31 points, including 15 in the fourth, and was excellent both with his jump shot (11-of-13) and from the free-throw line (9-of-11). Take that Jared Dudley! Dudley had called Simmons good in transition but average in the half-court game. That \u201caverage\u201d has given the Sixers a 2-1 lead in the first-round series and a chance to take a commanding lead in Game 4 on Saturday afternoon. With his performance, Simmons joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only 76ers to score 30-plus points with an 80-plus shooting percentage in a playoff game. Harris added 29 points and 16 rebounds, and Redick drained five 3-pointers and finished with 26 points. The fourth-quarter spurt from the Sixers overshadowed good performances from D\u2019Angelo Russell and Caris LeVert, who each scored 26. LeVert poured in 19 points in the second quarter. The Nets\u2019 Jarrett Allen had a nifty rebound and put-back slam early in Game 3, which elicited quite a bit of excitement on Brooklyn\u2019s bench. Look closely at the bench in the following tweet. Shabazz Napier, icing his right shoulder, is so worked up that he swung his left elbow into the upper cheek of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Who says basketball isn\u2019t a contact sport \u2014 even on the bench? Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool, no doubt. One game after giving up the largest lead in playoff history to the LA Clippers, Kevin Durant and the Warriors bounced back big-time from their Game 2 debacle . Durant erupted for 38 points and spent most of the fourth on the bench as the Warriors jumped on top early (the first quarter score was 41-24) and cruised to a 132-105 win over the Clippers in Game 3 . Golden State went on a 22-9 opening run and never looked back. Stephen Curry scored 21 despite getting into foul trouble. In case there existed any doubt, the message was clear that the Warriors are still in charge and up 2-1 in the first-round series . Durant passed Magic Johnson for 14th place on the all-time postseason scoring list. Johnson scored 3,701 postseason points during his storied career. Durant passed him with his first 2-pointer of Game 3 and finished with 38. Everybody\u2019s a coach in the playoffs. \u201cHere\u2019s what you do: If you get covered by two, it leaves another open.\u201d Basketball is simple, no? Is Jon Snow among the invaders?

Through Wednesday, the Sixers rank first in postseason efficiency (121.1 points scored per 100 possessions) and the Nets rank fifth (114.7). In regard to playoffs vs. regular season, Philadelphia has had the most improved offense (having scored 9.6 more per 100 than they did in the regular season) and Brooklyn has had the second most improved offense (5.9 more). That means that the defense has not been good and begs this question for the Nets and Sixers: How do we get a stop? On the Sixers\u2019 initial possessions, the Nets have allowed less than a point per trip down the floor (203 on 204). But a possession does not end with a missed shot and Brooklyn has struggled to complete its defensive possessions with a rebound. The Sixers lead the playoffs in offensive rebounding percentage by a wide margin, having grabbed more than 40 percent of available offensive boards. In the series, the Sixers have compiled 44 second-chance points, 11 more than any other team has through two games. In their 51-point third quarter in Game 2 , they only missed seven shots, but they rebounded five of them which they turned into 10 second-chance points . Nine different Sixers have grabbed at least one offensive rebound , with Ben Simmons (eight), Jimmy Butler (seven) and Joel Embiid (seven) leading the way. Boban Marjanovic has three offensive boards, but his ability to get his hands on the ball led to three more. That leads to Brooklyn\u2019s main issue: the Sixers are simply bigger and stronger than it is. Philadelphia\u2019s size advantage starts with Embiid, who has overpowered Jarrett Allen. In Allen\u2019s 33 minutes this series, the Sixers have as many offensive rebounds ( 13 ) as the Nets have defensive rebounds ( 13 ). Of course, that\u2019s less than half of the offensive boards that the Sixers have grabbed in this series. (They didn\u2019t have any offensive rebounds in the 10:05 of Game 2 garbage time , by the way.) Six of Philadelphia\u2019s 31 offensive boards can be chalked up to Embiid or Marjanovic being stronger or taller than Allen. The others have been a result of other Nets failing to contain a ball-handler, failing to box out, or simply getting beat to the ball. This is not a new problem for Brooklyn. In the regular season, the Nets ranked 23rd in defensive rebounding percentage , lowest among the 16 playoff teams. The Sixers only ranked 11th in offensive rebounding percentage, but given the size discrepancy, both at center and with whomever is guarding Ben Simmons, this is not a good rebounding matchup for the Nets. The Nets have outscored the Sixers, 78-36, from 3-point range. Brooklyn is 26-for-62 (42 percent) on 3-pointers, with its 26 3-pointers tied for the second most in the postseason and its 42-percent shooting ranking third . Interestingly, the Nets have shot much better on pull-up 3-pointers ( 16-for-27 , which is more pull-up 3-pointers than the Houston Rockets have) than they have on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers ( 10-for-34 ). Five of those 16 off-the-dribble 3s (three from Theo Pinson and two from Shabazz Napier) were in that 10:05 of Game 2 garbage time. Spencer Dinwiddie, D\u2019Angelo Russell and Caris LeVert have combined to shoot 9-for-20 on pull-ups , too. The Sixers\u2019 pick-and-roll defense, with their bigs hanging back in the paint, is the main issue here\u2026 The Nets defend pick-and-rolls the same way, but the Sixers don\u2019t run nearly as many pick-and-rolls and their primary ball-handler can\u2019t shoot outside of 10 feet. While Brooklyn ranked third in pull-up 3-pointers in the regular season , Philadelphia ranked 29th. Dropping the big in pick-and-rolls puts the onus on the ball-handler\u2019s defender to not get caught in the screen. And the Sixers turned things up defensively in the second half of Game 2. Prior to those last 10 minutes of garbage time, Brooklyn didn\u2019t make a single second-half 3-pointer on Monday. The Nets missed some open catch-and-shoot looks, but, with the exception of a Dinwiddie miss (when Mike Scott was the culprit) after the Sixers had already gone up 18, their ball-handlers weren\u2019t allowed to comfortably step in to pull-up attempts. Philadelphia\u2019s defenders (Simmons in particular) did a better job of either preventing the pick-and-roll from happening (by getting in between the ball-handler and the screener) or getting over the screen with minimal contact. The Sixers still need to do a better job of keeping Dinwiddie from getting downhill. Through two games, he has as many points in the restricted area ( 16 on 8-for-11 shooting ) as Embiid ( 8-for-12 ). On the flip side, limiting Joe Harris to just five catch-and-shoot 3-points attempts in two games is a good thing for the Philly defense. (J.J. Redick is an identical 2-for-5 on catch-and-shoot threes , by the way.) The Sixers seem to be in better shape. Their offensive rebounding is more sustainable than the Nets\u2019 shooting off the dribble and they played better defense in the second half of Game 2. They\u2019re also just bigger and more talented than the Nets. As the series moves to Brooklyn for Games 3 and 4, Embiid remains less than 100 percent and the Nets should have Jared Dudley (who was a plus-16 in Game 1 ) back from a one-game absence. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Embiid was whistled for a flagrant foul on Monday for throwing an elbow at Allen late in the half as the Philadelphia 76ers were nursing a 65-64 lead. After the game, he apologized for the elbow \u2014 but he and Simmons were both lightly chuckling as he said that. On Wednesday, Nets guard Caris LeVert said he and his teammates didn\u2019t appreciate that aspect of the situation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really like that,\u201d LeVert said, per Greg Logan of Newsday . \u201cWe thought that was kind of disrespectful, especially after the elbow he threw. There\u2019s no love lost. It\u2019s a playoff series. We expect that.\u201d When asked if Embiid\u2019s actions demand a physical response, LeVert said: \u201cWe just want to play our game and do whatever it takes to win. Be physical when we can. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re a dirty team. We definitely have to protect ourselves out there.\u201d For the record, what Embiid said in his postgame apology was the following: \u201cI saw the replay and obviously wasn\u2019t intentional and I got him pretty good and I\u2019m sorry about \u2026\u201d Embiid then looked at Simmons and the both started laughing. Embiid then spoke again saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it. It wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not usually humble, that\u2019s why he\u2019s laughing,\u201d Embiid said during the news conference, nodding toward Simmons. \u201cBut, yeah, I was just trying to be aggressive.\u201d While Embiid was given a Flagrant 1 for the elbow, many on the Nets felt he could have been penalized further for it. Still, they know they cannot take matters into their own hands in Game 3. \u201cTwo young guys doing, saying whatever they said in the moment. It is what it is,\u201d Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie said, per ESPN.com . \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we can play into, right, because if we get into a physicality match, if [Allen] throws the same elbow and hits Joel, he\u2019s getting ejected. That\u2019s just kind of what it is. We can\u2019t play that game.\u201d Allen, for his part, isn\u2019t fretting over the comments made after Game 2 and is looking to move on from it all. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to think about it. I\u2019m just thinking how I say it. I don\u2019t think there was any malice,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI just think it was an aggressive play. Go to the next play and play basketball.\u201d Veteran Jared Dudley, who missed Game 2 due to tightness in his calf, described Embiid as a \u201csilly guy.\u201d He also wondered why the NBA did not fine Embiid for his foul. \u201cI felt a certain type of way for it just because you\u2019re laughing and someone could have really gotten hurt,\u201d Dudley said, per Newsday . \u201cLuckily, Jay did pop up.

But with little to no resistance from the Utah Jazz through eight quarters of this first-round Western Conference playoff series, it might be an appropriate time to at least entertain a few questions about this version of the Rockets and what they might be capable of in the near future. First, are they better than they were a year ago, when they hosted the Golden State Warriors in a Game 7 on this same Toyota Center floor? \u201cI think James [Harden] is having a better year than he did last year,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said of the reigning Kia MVP. \u201cI think Chris [Paul] is healthy. I think, yeah, we\u2019re definitely better. We haven\u2019t proved it yet. But yeah, I think we can be better.\u201d Better prepared to deal with the Warriors in a potential matchup in the Western Conference semifinals? The coach of the team standing in the Rockets\u2019 way right now certainly sees an opponent that has grown and matured compared to the crew that whipped his team in the conference semifinals last season. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that a team that could win [65] games is better,\u201d Utah Jazz coach Quit Snyder said Wednesday before his team was thumped by the Rockets for the second straight time, 118-98 at Toyota Center . \u201cBut I think what they\u2019ve gone through throughout the course of the year, the identity that they formed last year as a group, I think they have that. \u201cBut any time a group is together for a longer period of time, you get CP and James having played together for the second straight year, you add [Kenneth] Faried and add more depth there, and guys like [Danuel] House and [Austin] Rivers. \u201cYou go across the board, they play in many respects the same way, but they\u2019ve seen more in terms of how people have tried to guard them, so they\u2019re more prepared I think, just with nuances, and more connected in certain situations. You guys have seen that in the last few months. They\u2019re playing great.\u201d How great remains to be seen. We won\u2019t know for sure until the Rockets are challenged in a series, something Utah hasn\u2019t been able to do thus far. The Jazz have lost back-to-back playoff games by 20 or more points for the first time in franchise history. Overall they\u2019ve lost five straight to the Rockets, who are clearly playing with a different edge right now. Instead of looking past the Jazz, they are focusing on taking them apart in preparation for what comes next. The series shifts to an arena in Salt Lake City that will serve up as merciless an atmosphere as you can find in the league for visiting teams. Give up the kind of wide-open looks the Jazz missed throughout a sloppy second half Wednesday, turn the ball over 18 times in a hostile, electric environment, and things could get much more interesting. \u201cWe gotta hoop,\u201d Paul said of the way the Rockets can maintain their laser focus on the road. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there before. They\u2019ve been here, we\u2019ve been there. It\u2019s two teams that\u2019s very familiar with each other. And us, we\u2019ve got enough vets to know that we did what we were supposed to do. You win your home games. And Game 3 will be a big game for us. We know they\u2019ll be a lot more comfortable going into their home court with their home fans. Fortunately, we\u2019ve been there before.\u201d That sort of collective experience is guiding the Rockets these days. Well, that and the relentless leadership of Paul and Harden, who collected his second career 30-point playoff triple-double. \u201cChris and James, when they are getting us going and pushing and being aggressive,\u201d Rockets swingman P.J. Tucker said, \u201cthey make it easy for all of us.\u201d It looked so easy Wednesday, even with the Rockets losing some of their edge after taking that huge halftime lead. D\u2019Antoni warned against it, knowing his team saw what happened to the Warriors and their 31-point advantage against the Clippers Monday in Oakland. But every time the Jazz did anything to rally, at least as best you can when you suffer through the fifth-worst 3-point shooting effort in postseason history (8-for-38, 21.1 percent), the Rockets had an answer. Whether it was Harden or Paul attacking the guts of the Jazz defense, challenging Rudy Gobert at the rim or finding shooters spaced all over the floor, the Rockets\u2019 offense was clicking. And they were every bit as relentless on the defensive end, swarming to loose balls and scrapping for every inch around the rim. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re locked in,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI think some of the things we didn\u2019t do well [tonight], we didn\u2019t take care of the basketball. I think we had 18 turnovers; that\u2019s way too many. Like I said (in the) on-court interview, we can\u2019t have 18 turnovers on the road. They capitalize, especially at home with 3s and layups. So, we\u2019ve got to take care of the basketball, get good shots, and that allows our defense to get back and set up.\u201d It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s no room for complacency this time around. Not for a team bent on revisiting the golden opportunity that slipped through their grasp last season. Because the Rockets, to a man, believe they are the team built to pull off the true shocker of this postseason and dethrone the Warriors. That\u2019s been clear in the way they\u2019ve played since the All-Star break, when their wounded bodies started healing and the old and new faces started meshing together into a cohesive group. \u201cObviously, we are confident,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cI thought we were confident all year. Even when we were 11-14, they were confident. They were driving me crazy, but they were confident. \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll get out of it.\u2019 They\u2019ve always had the belief once they get healthy, they lock in. And we\u2019re as good as anybody, if not better than everybody. It\u2019s a good level. Now, the series kind of starts and we got to be ready for them.\u201d So as much as what\u2019s going on with the Rockets right now is focused on the Jazz and to a greater extent the Warriors, it\u2019s really just about the Rockets. A team that dropped to fourth in the playoff standings on the final night of the regular season could end up doing what a 65-win juggernaut with the best offense in league history could not. The Warriors have never looked more vulnerable, more like \u2026 well, like the rest of the teams trying to scale the mountain Steve Kerr\u2019s crew has in three of the past four seasons. All the Rockets want is another crack at it, with this deeper, more resolute bunch than the group that reached the doorstep of The Finals last season. They want it this time with a core group that\u2019s been through moments that either fortify you or break you. They want another shot at handling the business at hand and that unfinished business, too. And they\u2019ll attack it with a renewed internal focus. \u201cYou know what\u2019s crazy?\u201d Tucker said. \u201cWe always just focus on us. We don\u2019t really focus on the other team, we don\u2019t focus on what they are doing. We always just talk about us. And I\u2019ve said this and they always kind of just messed up my quote, but, if we do what we do, I don\u2019t think anybody can beat us. And that\u2019s a fact. I don\u2019t care. If we come out every night and we talk and communicate and when our two guys get going and they are aggressive \u2026 we\u2019re tough.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Trailing 82-70 early in the fourth quarter, Boston mounted a 16-0 run, holding the Pacers scoreless for almost eight minutes to seize control of Game 2 at home. Or so they thought. Indiana fought back to re-take the lead \u2013 91-89 on a Bojan Bogdanovic 3-pointer \u2014 with 2:16 left. The Pacers wouldn\u2019t score again. Instead, the Celtics pulled off their second spurt of the game, finishing with a 10-0 run to cap off the 99-91 win and grab a 2-0 series lead . Jayson Tatum, who finished with 26 points, did it all in the final minute, hitting the go-ahead triple with 50 seconds left, feeding Gordon Hayward for a bucket and finishing it off with a thunderous and-1 dunk to seal the win. \u201cThat was a hell of a pass by (Jaylen Brown) and I was able to knock it down,\u201d Tatum said of the go-ahead 3-pointer. \u201cGordon (Hayward) made a great cut.

Then, with the Pistons hanging around in the fourth quarter, Giannis did it on the other end, sending Maker\u2019s shot into the first row. Minutes later, Giannis finished a breakaway against three Pistons by spinning in a righthanded layup, slithering around Andre Drummond for the flip shot and-1, igniting the crowd and proving why he\u2019s a leading Kia MVP candidate. In the end, Antetokounmpo finished the night with 26 points, 12 rebounds and put a bow on the Bucks\u2019 120-99 win that gives them a 2-0 lead as the series shifts to Detroit. Shimmy shimmy nah  James Harden burned the Utah Jazz plenty on Wednesday night, but it was a miss that had the internet buzzing. After sending Ricky Rubio flying with a crossover, Harden was so open he had time to give a shoulder shimmy before settling in for the wide-open 3-pointer, which he then \u2026 missed. If that shot drops, we\u2019re talking about one of the most iconic moves ever. Instead, it might end up on Shaqtin\u2019 a Fool. Outside of that miss, though, Harden and the Rockets were unstoppable in Game 2. Harden finished with 32 points, going 6-for-13 from beyond the arc, hitting step-back bankshots while being fouled , crossover step-backs and pullup step-backs on the break. It was a masterful performance, and the Jazz seem to have no answers for Houston\u2019s attack. Even when Harden wasn\u2019t knocking down 3s, he was getting teammates involved, finishing with 10 assists and 13 rebounds for the triple-double in the Rockets\u2019 wire-to-wire 118-98 Game 2 win . It was Harden\u2019s second 30-plus point triple-double in the playoffs, putting him in some elite company.

Players look for blowouts and laughers and games they can win with a few quarters to spare. The Milwaukee Bucks followed up their breezy Game 1 rout of the Detroit Pistons with something more grimy and grindy Wednesday at Fiserv Forum. They got blitzed in the second quarter, 32-20, trailed by a point at halftime and got outscored again at the start of the fourth, 10-2. So much for winning their best-of-seven series in three. \u201cPersonally, if we could have games like Game 1 through the entire playoffs, I\u2019d love it,\u201d Bucks reserve guard Pat Connaughton said after his team had to scratch its way back before taking a 2-0 lead to Detroit this weekend.  Connaughton, 26, was a catalyst, stepping up to join Milwaukee\u2019s unofficial Big Three of Giannis Antetokounmpo (26 points, 12 rebounds), Khris Middleton (24 points, eight assists) and Eric Bledsoe (27 points, six assists, three steals). The athletic 6-foot-4 Notre Dame product chipped in 18 points, nine rebounds and four \u2014 yes, four \u2014 blocked shots in 31 minutes. \u201cI think getting tested does bring a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing my dad used to always tell me was, \u2018You learn more from losing than winning.\u2019 Now, we try to make sure we learn from winning as well.\u201d You don\u2019t win 60 games during the regular season and two more in the first week of the postseason by not heeding lessons. What coach Mike Budenholzer saw in the first half, when the Pistons hushed the sellout crowd, were the same things his players knew, slippage so unlike them \u2014 against a mediocre opponent like Detroit, missing All-Star Blake Griffin (left knee soreness) again \u2014 that it ticked them off. Matter of fact, when Budenholzer sized up the Bucks in their halftime locker room, trailing 59-58, he barely had to say anything to them at all. There had been some selfish plays and some stagnant play. He knew. They knew. And he knew they knew. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a great job responding all year,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, \u201cand I think he trusts us. He knows we know when we\u2019ve messed up, when we\u2019ve not put in enough effort. So he just comes in, he looks at our faces \u2014 we\u2019re all pissed off and mad \u2013and he\u2019s like, \u2018OK, you guys go out there and do your jobs.\u2019 That\u2019s what we try to do.\u201d The Bucks\u2019 main guys did the obvious things, such as Antetokounmpo\u2019s 13 points in the third quarter, which Milwaukee dominated 35-17, and Bledsoe scoring eight in the fourth. Together, though, they all did less-documented things. Like poking away Pistons passes, diving to the floor and following up shots to seize extra opportunities. Said Budenholzer: \u201cWhen your best players are getting on the floor for loose balls, getting 50\/50 balls, doing things defensively, everybody\u2019s watching that. I think the whole team follows those three\u2019s leads. The second half was a great example of it.\u201d One pivotal play came with 7:47 left, as Connaughton missed a 3-pointer. Detroit seemingly had drawn as close as 95-88 \u2013 \u201cseemingly\u201d because the Pistons would lose one basket on a replay review that showed the shot clock had expired. But no one knew it as Connaughton\u2019s shot bounced off to the left. And no one knew it when Bledsoe, all 6-foot-1 of him, leaped, corralled the ball with his left hand and guided it in. A couple trips later, Middleton stole the ball from Detroit\u2019s Bruce Brown and found Bledsoe for a twisting reverse layup that made it 99-86 with 7:10 to go. It got no closer. By the end, the numbers looked a lot like Game 1 with its fat final margin and big scoring numbers for the Bucks. Yet it was their No. 1-ranked defense that enabled them to snatch back this one. They outscored Detroit 62-40 after halftime, held the Pistons to 14-of-41 shooting and allowed them just a single offensive board. They pestered Detroit into seven turnovers in the half and a 17-2 edge in fast-break points. Connaughton looks like the quintessential hustle-and-glue guy, so putting up fancy numbers \u2014 particularly the blocks, a logical extension of the zealous way he contests shots \u2014 seems like a bonus and might even feel like a fluke. But no more so than the Middleton doing a belly flop on the hardwood or Antetokounmpo raking through a thicket of arms and hands to knock loose the ball. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the culture of this team,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best when guys are really putting forth that energy, that effort, and that consistency of both. Coach has harped on that throughout the season, and it\u2019s our job to make sure we continue it whether we\u2019re starters or bench guys or not in the rotation at the moment.\u201d Contrast that with the Pistons, whose coach was pining for the sort of sustained scrappiness Milwaukee demonstrated all season. Detroit started better (with shooter Luke Kennard getting a start for his firepower) and made that push early in the fourth quarter. It was just the parts in between and around where they faltered. \u201cOur challenge has been extending hard play, not getting bored with doing fundamentals,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cNot getting bored kicking the ball out\u2026 Defensively, staying solid and making sure we execute. That\u2019s a discipline that has to be at the top of our charts going into the next game and next year.\u201d The next game in this series is Friday on the Pistons\u2019 court. Next season? That\u2019s hurtling toward them, too, even if Griffin manages to drag his left leg onto the court. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It happens every year. But only to a player. And only in late winter, when the trade deadline approaches. So this represents a twist. What\u2019s happening here in the playoffs, to the surprise of some, is the showcasing of an entire organization, in this case, the Clippers. They\u2019re sprucing themselves up and using their first-round series with the Warriors to spread their peacock feathers and get the attention of top free agents looking for a landing spot. We will know shortly after July 1 whether the showcasing of the Clippers actually worked. But at the very least, the Clippers have done enough already to put themselves on the radar of the best free agents, which is all they can ask. They\u2019re making it hard for any A-list free agent to say no. Although they\u2019re fresh off a historic rally from 31 points down in Game 2, and still showing the grit and togetherness that fueled a surprising 48-win regular season, the Clippers are haunted by two things they\u2019re sorely missing. One: A take-charge franchise player. Two: A realistic chance of shocking the world and beating the Warriors three more times. Those two go hand-in-hand, because the postseason demands stars, and you can\u2019t be taken seriously unless you have at least two, and the Warriors are suiting up four. Which means the arithmetic isn\u2019t in LA\u2019s favor, not this series and at least not this season. If you placed their hand on a Bible, they\u2019d admit they\u2019re more concerned about winning the offseason than beating the Warriors. That\u2019s because, with a good summer, the Clippers can become a contender. With a great summer, they can switch places with the Warriors this time next April. And that\u2019s why this \u201cshowcasing\u201d means everything for the franchise. Put yourself in the position of a game-changing free agent and ask: What\u2019s important, and do the Clippers, who could have enough money under the cap to sign two top free agents, check all the boxes? Coaching? Well, Doc Rivers is commonly mentioned, along with Gregg Popovich and maybe a select few others, as the coach most players would like to play for. And it just so happens that Rivers is doing perhaps the best coaching of his career right now \u2014 this from someone who already has a Coach of the Year award and won a championship in Boston. Rivers is walking the tightrope without the safety of an All-Star; the Clippers traded their best player, Tobias Harris, months ago. He has the guts to start a pair of rookies, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet, in the backcourt. Two of his top scorers, Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, come off the bench and have not once complained about it. Plus, this team grinds. \u201cThis is an extraordinary group in its own right,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cThey buy into it. Bill Russell once said about his teammates, `Sometimes you\u2019ve got to pull them along with you.\u2019 That\u2019s what we have here. They pull each other.\u201d Supporting cast? The Clippers are loaded with role players who accept those roles. That\u2019s not typical on the average NBA team, where one or two players are worried about shots or minutes or, mostly, money. The Clippers\u2019 supporting cast just plays, which is ideal for an incoming superstar who can have the ego all to himself. \u201cWe\u2019re all fine with it,\u201d said Pat Beverley. \u201cWe know when our playing time is coming so we don\u2019t argue about it. We know when we\u2019re coming out the game and we don\u2019t argue about that, either. We give each other love and respect and hope for success.\u201d But these aren\u2019t ordinary role players. Williams may only do one thing well, but it\u2019s very well. Same for Harrell, a hardcore clean-up man. Danilo Gallinari can drop 20 points and never demands the ball. Beverley will accept the toughest defensive assignment regardless of size; have you seen what he\u2019s doing against Kevin Durant in this series? Surround a top All-Star with these players and chemistry shouldn\u2019t be an issue. The Clippers win despite not being a volume 3-point shooting team and lacking a dominant big man. Which is to say, they\u2019re not following trends, they set their own trend. And the players are flexible enough to adapt if a new system is necessary to accommodate a great incoming player. Money? Check the Forbes list for this guy: Last name Ballmer, first name Steve, and see the owner\u2019s net worth. Here\u2019s a hint: You can\u2019t count that high. Locale? Any star craving a big market will have all the business trappings of LA along with the weather. Of course, much of Los Angeles traditionally is lukewarm to the Clippers, and \u201cLob City\u201d captured the curiosity but not the imagination of the city. But there\u2019s an opening here \u2014 the Lakers are languishing even with LeBron James \u2014 and an opportunity. How many free agents will give the Clippers a meeting and then arrive to see Rivers, Ballmer and team consultant Jerry West sitting at the table, and won\u2019t walk away impressed? The Clippers aren\u2019t trying to get rave reviews from the Warriors, although that\u2019s happening anyway. They\u2019re hoping Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker and \u2014 get this \u2014 Durant are taking notice and taking notes. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done so far,\u201d said Beverley, \u201cshows the poise of this team, the character of this team, the high-level coach of this team and the heart of this team. It shows a lot.\u201d Rivers likened his team to roaches, respectfully and endearingly so because those pests are hard to contain, let alone kill. Ultimately, someone with a size 14 comes along and stomps enough to win the war, a scenario that will likely play itself in Warriors vs. Clippers. This first-round series might be over by next Wednesday, and most teams on the losing end might lose sleep over being shoved aside in five games. Yet, while the Warriors would move on to the second round in that scenario, the Clippers will soon move onto something bigger \u2014 and, they hope, better. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Davis, who is under contract with the Pelicans for one more season, requested a trade in late January. In the aftermath, the Pelicans fired general manager Dell Demps, who has been effectively replaced by Griffin, albeit under a different title. The Pelicans hired Griffin on Friday and formally introduced him on Wednesday. Griffin said he has not yet met with Davis, but disputed the notion that Davis\u2019 situation in New Orleans became too toxic to salvage. \u201cQuite the opposite, actually,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cRich is genuinely excited about this situation. Rich represents the greatest player of his generation and he saw LeBron buy into what we were doing and our direction (in Cleveland) and the respect he had for what we did.\u201d Pelicans owner Gayle Benson said she liked Griffin\u2019s outlook on Davis. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want somebody here whose heart isn\u2019t in it, but hopefully Anthony will have a change of heart and if he does, we\u2019ll welcome him back with open arms,\u201d Benson said. \u201cWe\u2019d like for him to stay if everybody agrees to it.\u201d Even if Davis doesn\u2019t say, it is arguably in the Pelicans\u2019 interest to attempt to keep him, if only to create more urgency on the part of prospective trade partners. Meanwhile, Griffin also called the retention of Gentry a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d The two worked together in Phoenix, when Gentry coached the Suns to the Western Conference finals. Griffin went so far as to call Gentry\u2019s presence as head coach \u201cone of big, big factors in this decision for me.\u201d \u201cMy leadership style is to build a family \u2013 a family that loves each other enough to tell each other what they need to hear. Alvin and I can do that for each other,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cHaving a partner in this process gives us an enormous leg up.\u201d Griffin added that when he worked with Gentry in Phoenix, \u201cAlvin was really honest about the fact that he\u2019s at his best when he\u2019s fearless Alvin \u2013 when he\u2019s not looking over his shoulder, when he\u2019s not feeling like he has to do everything by himself. And I think we can put him a space to be the best of his angels.\u201d Benson noted that every candidate interviewed for the job eventually given to Griffin said they would be inclined to reatain Gentry, who she credited for doing an \u201cincredible job under very challenging times\u201d this season. \u201cHe just needs to get the right players together,\u201d Benson said later. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some bad breaks.\u201d Griffin was among a half-dozen candidates who interviewed to become New Orleans top basketball operations executive in recent weeks, including interim general manager Danny Ferry.

Coach Steve Kerr has named Andrew Bogut as his starter in place of Cousins for Game 3 Thursday night of the team\u2019s first-round playoff series against the Clippers in Los Angeles. Playing in just his second career postseason game after a nine-year wait, the 28-year-old Cousins went down in the first quarter of a 135-131 Game 2 loss Monday night. He fell in front of the Golden State bench after swiping a ball from Patrick Beverley in the back court. Cousins immediately grabbed at his left quad then hobbled to the locker room at the 8:09 mark. The tear was revealed by an MRI exam Tuesday. The big man returned in January from a nearly yearlong absence while recovering from surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon. \u201cMore than anything, I\u2019m just crushed for DeMarcus,\u201d Kerr said Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s been waiting his whole career for this and the second game he goes down after putting all that work in to recover from the Achilles.

Teammates Kevin Durant and Draymond Green wanted to respect Cousins\u2019 space but planned to reach out. \u201cJust definitely thinking about him. I know for a fact with how much medicine is so good and doctors and all that stuff is so good, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back fine, be back to 100 percent after his rehab, so I\u2019m looking forward to that,\u201d Durant said.

Then Jamal Murray rediscovered his stroke. Murray, who missed his first eight shots, made eight of nine in a sizzling fourth quarter in which he scored 21 of his 24 points, leading Denver to a 114-105 victory . It was the biggest playoff comeback in Nuggets history. Step-backs, fadeaways, floaters \u2014 everything was falling for Murray when the Nuggets needed him most. Murray hit back-to-back 3-pointers with less than three minutes remaining to seal the raucous win, maybe saving the Nuggets season. In a postgame interview, Murray credited coach Mike Malone and his teammates for telling him to keep shooting. Malone said he never considered benching Murray because he didn\u2019t want to crush his confidence. He said he took him aside at halftime and told him to take a deep breath and trust his shots would start falling. \u201cNever once did I think about pulling him from the lineup,\u201d Malone said. Meanwhile, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was furious with his team\u2019s late collapse, and perhaps the referees who gave him a technical instead of a timeout. He held a short postgame press conference which he ended abruptly. \u201cWe gave up 38 points in the fourth quarter. End of story,\u201d fumed Popovich. Actually, it was 39. The series shifts to San Antonio for Game 3 Thursday night. After dropping the series opener, the Toronto Raptors were all business in Game 2. Kawhi Leonard scored 37 points, Kyle Lowry bounced back from a scoreless Game 1 with 22 and the Raptors steamrolled the Magic 111-82 , evening their Eastern Conference first-round series at one win apiece. Leonard scored at will from the opening jump and finished with a career playoff-high 15 field goals. He made his first nine attempts from inside the arc before missing a layup. After scoring 17 points in the first half, Leonard dropped 17 in the quarter alone, culminating with this crossover and dunk. Leonard finished 15 for 22 from the field before leaving to a standing ovation with 4:46 remaining and Toronto ahead 104-73. \u201cI knew what we had at stake tonight,\u201d Leonard said after the game. The series now shifts to Orlando, where the Magic haven\u2019t lost since Feb. 22. CJ McCollum\u2019s 3-pointer to beat the halftime buzzer tied the game and erased what had been a 10-point Oklahoma City Thunder lead. Damian Lillard\u2019s 3-pointer to beat the third-quarter buzzer gave the Portland Trail Blazers a 16-point lead. By the end of the fourth quarter, the Blazers didn\u2019t need another buzzer-beater. Portland\u2019s backcourt duo combined for 62 points, and the Blazers pulled away from the Thunder for a 114-94 victory and a 2-0 series lead . Lillard was locked in all night, knocking down deep 3-pointers and stuffing the stat sheet with 29 points, four rebounds, six assists, three steals and two blocks. For the second straight game, Lillard frustrated Russell Westbrook, who finished with 14 points (5-of-20 shooting) and six turnovers. Things got a little chippy between the two All-Stars late in the second quarter when Lillard hounded Westbrook in the corner. Fortunately, no fouls were called and cooler heads prevailed. Game 3 is set for Friday night in Oklahoma City. Dame Time: Lillard knocking down a 35-footer because, well \u2026 he can. \u201cI\u2019m happy about it, but I really don\u2019t care. A series doesn\u2019t start til you win on the road.\u201d \u2013 Lillard on Portland\u2019s 2-0 series lead Jamal Murray\u2019s 21 points are the most by any player in the fourth quarter of a playoff game since Paul George in 2014."},{"id":34255,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-avoid-game-2-over-confidence-vs-pistons","date":"2019-04-17","title":"Bucks look to avoid Warrior-like misstep versus Pistons in Game 2","content":" * Tonight on NBA TV: Game 2, Pistons vs. Bucks (8 ET) MILWAUKEE \u2014 Tough lessons go down a little easier when the other guy is paying the tuition. The Milwaukee Bucks have been auditing a class in playoff do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for a few days now, learning things that other students haven\u2019t exactly heeded. Protect home court? Oops. Home teams have lost once already in four of the NBA\u2019s eight playoff series , giving back that advantage that so drove them through the long regular season. Never assume any lead is safe? Sheesh, that\u2019s exactly what the Golden State Warriors appeared to do in coughing up a 31-point margin over the LA Clippers Monday to let control of that Western Conference first-round series slip through their fingers. The Bucks took to heart the home-court reminder when they dominated the Detroit Pistons, their first-round foes, from start to finish Sunday night at Fiserv Forum . Now they\u2019ll have fresh in their minds the Warriors\u2019 serious misstep when they face the Pistons again Wednesday , eager to build in Game 2 something approaching their 43-point lead in the opener and, if so, pledged to protect it. \u201cIt\u2019s defintely a reference,\u201d reserve guard Pat Connaughton told reporters Tuesday at the team\u2019s practice facility. \u201cThere are times coaches will make a joke \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m beating a dead horse.\u2019 But when you see it actually happen, it resonates even more with the players and with the coaches. To see something like that happen and to understand we\u2019re in the same position, as far as seeding goes, how can we make sure we avoid it?\u201d The Clippers have spent most of the season\u2019s second half overachieving, winning games beyond the talent their roster seems to have on paper. Detroit needed to qualify as the East\u2019s last seed on the regular season\u2019s final night. The Pistons are a .500 team now hobbled by the absence of All-Star forward Blake Griffin, who missed the opener with chronic left knee soreness. Should Detroit\u2019s limitations on both ends make the Bucks feel more secure or less secure as they seek to go up 2-0 before the series shifts to Little Caesars Arena this weekend? Acutely aware and extremely vigilant sounds more like it. \u201cThe Golden State game, they had it quote-unquote \u2018in the bag,\u2019\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cAnd the Clippers kept fighting. We want to make sure we\u2019re on the side that never stops fighting.\u201d Like a number of NBA stars, the Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn\u2019t watch a lot of games in which he doesn\u2019t play. But there was no avoiding what befell the defending champs of Golden State, the biggest comeback in league playoff history. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay focused. You\u2019ve got to still play the right way. You cannot be sloppy,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cNot to comment as much on what the Warriors did, but they were sloppy offensively, they weren\u2019t getting back defensively. I think they were just being a little bit lazy. When you\u2019re being lazy, the basketball gods watch the game and you\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d There is a price to be paid every which way for any team skilled and fortunate enough to bloat its lead to 20 points, 30 points or beyond. Frustration that can set in for an opponent, whether surrendering or not, can lead to the sort of flagrant foul Detroit\u2019s Andre Drummond committed on Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee\u2019s most treasured asset. The Pistons center, who had gotten thrown into coach Dwane Casey\u2019s on-the-fly adjustments of guarding the versatile and vexing Bucks star. With four minutes left in the third quarter, Drummond looked out of answers when he shoved Antetokounmpo to the floor. There\u2019s also the risk of taking one\u2019s foot off the gas, losing momentum in that night\u2019s game by trying to limit wear and tear for the next one. Only wing Sterling Brown, of Milwaukee\u2019s starters, saw action in the fourth quarter as coach Mike Budenholzer subbed out his main guys. The Bucks led 97-61 when that period began, but Detroit got a little spark, making 50 percent of its shots on a night it otherwise shot 35 percent and outscoring Milwaukee 25-24. Allowing a beaten opponent to get even a glimmer of a sliver of a spark can be dangerous in a best-of-seven series that \u2014 days off not withstanding \u2014 can slip away quickly. The Bucks feel they\u2019re imbued with the right amount of humility, even against an over-matched Detroit squad. They lost nine times this season against teams that didn\u2019t make the playoffs, including New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and Phoenix twice. \u201cGames that we lost that we felt we didn\u2019t play our brand of basketball,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cWe fell into the lull of contentment.\u201d They weren\u2019t shy, either, about keeping their feet on other opponents\u2019 throats, winning 45 times by 10 points or more. And the Bucks have reserves to tap, confident that they can clean up in a few areas (15-of-43 from the arc in Game 1 and 19 points allowed off turnovers) while pressing harder on the Pistons. Whatever Casey tried defensively \u2014 Drummond switched onto Antetokounmpo, Thon Maker\u2019s foul-plagued minutes, a little-used zone \u2014 Milwaukee appeared capable of inflicting more damage than it did. Antetokounmpo, after all, sat (24:32) more than he played (23:28) and still had 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 free-throw attempts. Of course, the minute the Bucks start counting on that stuff, humility flies out the window and vulnerability creeps in. \u201cDon\u2019t let up, man,\u201d Brown said, of the overarching lesson. \u201cStay aggressive at both ends. Stick to the game plan. Keep the pressure on. \u201cThe message throughout the team is just to stay poised and focused on us. Don\u2019t let nothing outside try to get in and stop what we\u2019ve got going. No type of distraction can get to us right now.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 DeMarcus Cousins has a torn left quadriceps muscle that will sideline the Golden State center indefinitely, a devastating injury that the Warriors feared was serious when he went down in the first quarter of their first-round playoff loss to the Clippers. An MRI exam Tuesday morning on Cousins\u2019 left leg revealed the tear. The two-time defending NBA champion Warriors said Cousins will begin rehabilitation immediately and updates will be \u201cprovided as appropriate.\u201d Coach Steve Kerr said after the Warriors\u2019 135-131 Game 2 loss on Monday night that Cousins would be out for a significant period. Playing in just his second career postseason game after a nine-year wait, Cousins went down in the first quarter in front of the Golden State bench after swiping a ball from Patrick Beverley in the back court. He immediately grabbed at his left quad. Cousins hobbled to the locker room at the 8:09 mark. Cousins had just returned in January from a nearly yearlong absence following surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon suffered while with the Pelicans last season. He had two points, two rebounds and an assist in less than 4 minutes Monday. He fouled out of Saturday\u2019s 121-104 Game 1 win with nine points, nine rebounds and four assists in 21 minutes. \u201cI know it\u2019s frustrating for him. I\u2019ve been through something like that, getting hurt, getting all the way back and then getting hurt again, so I know how frustrating it is,\u201d Warriors center Kevon Looney said. \u201cHe is a resilient guy. He\u2019s been through adversity before and I know he\u2019s going to bounce back. His spirit is probably low right now, but he\u2019s a tough guy and he\u2019ll be back better than ever.\u201d Looney picked up more minutes with Cousins\u2019 injury and scored a career-high 19 points while making all six of his shots in 19 minutes. Kerr is likely to use a combination of shot-blocking presence Andrew Bogut and Looney going forward this postseason. Bogut\u2019s signing last month for a second stint with the franchise means so much more now. Kerr called him an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d and Bogut \u2013 who had been playing back home in Australia \u2013 has made the most of his chances. He had nine rebounds, three points and a blocked shot in 16 minutes Monday. He played on the Warriors\u2019 2015 championship team and the 73-win team the following season that lost in Game 7 of the NBA Finals to LeBron James and the Cavaliers. The No. 1 overall draft pick in 2005 out of Utah, Bogut has been open to any role Kerr chooses for him, which now could be starting. \u201cObviously, there will be more minutes,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019ll still be matchup dependent, but I anticipate probably starting games, playing the first three or four minutes and then coming out.\u201d Stephen Curry expects the backups to fill the void as the Warriors\u2019 depth has done all season, with Jordan Bell also likely to be in the mix. \u201cExactly what they\u2019ve been doing. They\u2019ve been playing amazing the last part of the regular season and these first two games,\u201d Curry said. \u201c\u2026 It may look a little different considering the skill and talent and level that Boogie can bring when he\u2019s healthy.\u201d"},{"id":34253,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cousins-injury-game-2-clippers","date":"2019-04-16","title":"Cousins suffers 'significant' left quad injury in Game 2","content":"Golden State Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins made an early exit from Monday\u2019s Game 2 against the LA Clippers , suffering a left quadricep injury while tumbling after a loose ball with 8 1\/2 minutes remaining in the first quarter. Cousins wasn\u2019t contacted on the play, and immediately stayed down as the Clippers corralled possession and headed upcourt in transition. He immediately flagged the training staff and began heading toward the locker room, walking gingerly on the injured leg. The team updated his status shortly afterward, announcing he wouldn\u2019t return and will be undergoing an MRI within a day\u2019s time. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the team is fearful that Cousins has suffered a torn left quadriceps. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski : During the postgame news conference, Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters Cousin\u2019s injury was \u201cpretty significant\u201d and that he expected Cousins \u201cwould be out \u2026 a while.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll rally behind him, tell him it\u2019s far from the end of the world, tell him he has so much great basketball ahead of him,\u201d said Warriors guard Klay Thompson. \u201cHe believes that. \u2026 He\u2019ll bounce back.

Having signed with Golden State while rehabilitating a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon, Cousins had been eager to make his playoff debut in this ninth NBA season. In 30 games as a Warrior, Cousins averaged 16.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.5 blocks in 25.7 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for sure, you feel for him considering all he\u2019s been in this last year,\u201d said Warriors guard Stephen Curry. \u201cThis is a big stage, the playoffs.

No, to rise from the mat after falling behind by 31 points in the third quarter, history must be created \u2014 much like a work of art or a perfect melody or a four-course meal that satisfies every single taste bud. And so that\u2019s what the LA Clippers did in a 135-131 win Wednesday , mixing artistry, striking the proper chord and piecing together the right recipe to stage a rally on the road against the two-time defending champions that, much like the Clippers\u2019 season itself, blindsided everyone. Here are the scenes that told the story: Pat Beverley stripping Stephen Curry in the open floor \u2026 Beverley, buying a house inside Kevin Durant\u2019s head and reducing the Golden State Warriors\u2019 superstar to nine turnovers, eight shots and six fouls while also causing him to miss the final crucial minutes \u2026 Lou Williams dropping fadeaways and slashing through the Golden State defense better than a butcher \u2026 Montrezl Harrell snatching rebounds and refusing to miss a single shot \u2026 and finally, rookie Landry Shamet, who wasn\u2019t even a Clipper until two months ago, tying the bow with the eventual game-winning shot. Then the Clippers were strutting off the floor, bouncing into their locker room, laughing, yelling, high-fiving and celebrating like it\u2019s June. Allow them that indulgence. \u201cSometimes thing happen, huh?\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, offering a shrug. The Clippers scored 85 points in the second half, their relentless rally over the last 18 minutes catching the Warriors by surprise (and, most importantly, finishing the job). Williams scored 29 of his 37 points in the second half, Harrell 17 of his 25 . \u201cIt\u2019s who we are,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cYou just love this group. They don\u2019t give in. We were looking for a solution because they were beating us in every facet. We kind of stumbled on one we liked. But I thought t was our spirit more than anything. We just had to hang in there long enough.\u201d And the Warriors? \u201cWell,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr, \u201cwe stopped playing.\u201d If the Warriors need to pinpoint a cause, they can start with Durant. Two days removed from Game 1 where he took the bait from Beverley and earned an ejection, Durant apologized to his teammates for putting himself in that position. And then he repositioned himself for Game 2. How and why a star of Durant\u2019s magnitude has allowed a tiff with Beverley to become a thing is astonishing. Yet, Durant became unglued Monday against an aggressive, physical player who dwarfs him by seven inches. It was the gnat taking on the giraffe and coming away bigger from it. \u201cLook,\u201d Beverley said, \u201cI just go out there and just be Pat. I don\u2019t try to get in people\u2019s head I go out there and try to be the best defensive player on this planet. I take my role and my job very seriously. I understand my role.\u201d Beverley was playing it coy. He clearly knows what he\u2019s doing by attacking a star whose mental toughness has been questioned before, and Durant\u2019s refusal to ignore Beverley speaks volumes. More than the verbal tactics, though, Beverley\u2019s defense was stellar \u2014 employing the right positioning and ball denial while forcing Durant to pass up shots. For Beverley, the last two games have been satisfying for him. \u201cKD\u2019s not an easy cover,\u201d Beverley said. \u201cBut I had fun out there.\u201d Rivers loves Beverley\u2019s energy and passion and how he keeps it confined without losing control. \u201cHe\u2019s so important for us,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cPeople get lost in his antics but his spirit is so important for our team. He was encouraging everyone.\u201d Durant picked up early fouls against Beverley, and while the sixth and disqualifying foul wasn\u2019t against Beverley and was borderline at best, the damage was already done. The Warriors were already without DeMarcus Cousins, who suffered a left quad injury in the first quarter, and losing Durant stripped them of another big scorer. By then, the Clippers had seized momentum and suddenly had one less star to worry about. That allowed them to trap Curry late in a tight game, especially with Klay Thompson (17 points) struggling. Hounded by multiple Clippers, Curry missed seven of his nine shots in the fourth quarter and the Warriors had no other options or answers. Rivers pushed all the right buttons and the players gathered momentum and confidence as the lead tightened. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the guys getting blasted on national television,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou cut the lead to 12 and then to 10 and then you realize you got a game going. We just play hard, hard as you can and live with the results. I really can\u2019t recall a moment when I thought the momentum was changing until it was like a three-point game and then I thought we got a shot at winning this game. This was doable.\u201d Williams thought for a second, in disbelief: Down 31 points? \u201cThat\u2019s a record we really didn\u2019t want to have,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll take it.\u201d Beverley added: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been around this team, this is habit. We\u2019ve been down 28, 25, but continue to play the right way. We know how this feels.\u201d Curiously, the honor of the final shot went to Shamet, not Williams. Shamet arrived in the mid-season trade with the Philadelphia 76ers that cost the Clippers their leading scorer, Tobias Harris. The main question about the Clippers in the postseason lies with their lack of hero-ball players. On the most important possession of Game 2, the ball found a rookie. \u201cSoon as he caught it,\u201d Williams said, \u201cI put my hands up. I felt really good about the shot. He\u2019s just a pure all-out shooter. The loss for the Warriors was more embarrassing than anything. Their composure, smarts and defense were all diminished. For the final two quarters of Game 2, they looked more like disinterested bystanders who didn\u2019t snap to attention until it was too late. If nothing else, the Clippers have their attention as the series moves to Los Angeles for Games 3 and 4. After such a historic outcome, there might be substantially more Clippers fans than Warriors fans at Staples Center. \u201cWe enjoyed the night of course, but the reality is it\u2019s just one game,\u201d said Beverley. \u201cStill, it\u2019s going to be fun in LA.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

In the basketball bubble in which he works, referees and reporters are necessary evils and he often sees enemies where none exist, which add to his complexity. Those who know him best \u2014 and they can fit inside a shot glass \u2014 insist Cousins just doesn\u2019t trust very many, that\u2019s all. But what happens when the flesh and blood that\u2019s closest to him \u2014 his own body \u2014 winds up being the most untrustworthy of all? There\u2019s nothing else that can explain why, for the second time in 14 months, the 6-foot-11, 270-pound center dropped to the floor without being pushed and immediately grabbed a body part in pain. The extent of the left quad injury he suffered in Monday\u2019s Game 2 came down Tuesday as a reported tear , which will more than likely sideline him for the rest of the playoffs. When Cousins hustled for a stolen pass in the first quarter and fell right in front of the Warriors\u2019 bench, players and coaches jumped and knew something was wrong. The Oracle Arena crowd instantly hushed. This was no ordinary plop. Warriors coach Steve Kerr called the injury \u201csignificant\u201d while adding \u201che\u2019s going to be out for \u2026 I\u2019ll just say a while.\u201d Since it is a tear, his season is pretty much over. Had it been a strain, depending on severity, it would have cost him a chunk of the postseason \u2014 if not all of it. Cousins is in a Warriors\u2019 uniform only because the Achilles he tore two Februarys ago with the New Orleans Pelicans led him to Oakland in a search to restore his All-Star status, win a championship and mainly to cash in as a free agent this summer. It appeared a worthwhile gamble, to play for peanuts (relatively speaking) on what amounts to a stopover while mending peacefully and gradually without any sense of urgency on the team\u2019s behalf. Cousins put in the work, returned earlier than expected in January , was heartily welcomed by his new teammates and gradually regained his timing and conditioning. The Warriors carefully rationed his minutes and touches and yet, he averaged 25.7 minutes per game this season and looked frisky at times. His 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per game were impressive on a team that was loaded without him. He\u2019s a big man with a gentle touch, capable of posting up or shooting 3-pointers. Yet he\u2019s someone who languished nonetheless for six turbulent seasons in Sacramento before a flash of brilliance and refreshing serenity in his brief stay in New Orleans. To the two-time defending champion Warriors, who have four other All-Stars in the rotation, Cousins\u2019 worth is negotiable. More talent on the floor is always better. Still, Cousins amounts to a bonus and insurance in case something goes really wrong on this three-peat chase. Their vaunted \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup , with smaller and quicker players, was used in Game 1 vs. the Clippers while Cousins had six turnovers and fouled out. If Cousins is out, the Warriors have few options at center (and none who can match his skill set). Andrew Bogut was signed a month ago , but is fit and knows the system. Kevon Looney is more athletic and has played well as of late. And that\u2019s about it. There are longer-term implications as well, depending on what the MRI says. Cousins wanted to make a splash in free agency and because of a salary cap that\u2019s very limiting to what the Warriors can offer. That splash would be elsewhere and the Warriors are fine with that. \u201cThis is a one-year deal with us \u2026 we\u2019d like to help him win a championship and sign a great contract somewhere else,\u201d Kerr said. Instead, Cousins must deal with betrayal, from the person closest to him: Himself. \u201cYou feel for him because of what he\u2019s been through last year,\u201d said guard Stephen Curry. \u201cThis is the big stage, the playoffs.

Those are the raw facts, and they speak for themselves. Let it sink in: Greatest comeback in NBA playoff history. And yet, those details don\u2019t nearly encapsulate the sheer magnitude of what took place at Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena, where the two-time defending champions were well on their way to taking a commanding 2-0 lead before the bizarre inconsistencies that have plagued them all season reared their ugly heads once again, at the worst possible time. \u201cWe got exactly what we deserved,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. And so did the Clippers, who fought back from 28 and 25 points down to win games during the regular season. \u201cThis is who we\u2019ve been all season,\u201d Clippers sixth man Lou Williams said. Trailing by 31 with 19:31 remaining, they proceeded to outscore the Warriors 72-37 the rest of the way. (Some perspective: That\u2019s only two fewer points than the Indiana Pacers scored during the entirety of their 84-74 loss to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.) While the Clippers shot 69 percent on their final 39 shots, the Warriors could do almost nothing right, misfiring on 19 of their last 27 attempts \u2014 with 14 turnovers. It was a shocking display of carelessness and ineptitude from a team that, at its best, almost seems like it\u2019s playing a different sport. Williams fueled the inferno with 26 of his 36 points coming in those final, crucial minutes, while fellow spark plug Montrezl Harrell scored 15 of his 25 in the fourth . And what would a Clippers win be without some agitation from Hall-of-Fame irritant Patrick Beverley, who helped limit Kevin Durant to just eight shots in 34 minutes before fouling out. Beverley outdid himself at one point, fouling Durant twice and goading him into a pair of offensive fouls in a span of just 47 seconds. Beverley fouled out as well, on a flop in which Draymond Green took immense delight. But it wasn\u2019t too long before the Clippers were the ones doing the celebrating, heading back to Staples Center for Games 3 and 4 with home-court advantage while the Warriors look to pick up the pieces without staring center DeMarcus Cousins, who could be out for an extended period with what Kerr called a \u201cpretty significant\u201d quad injury . \u201cIt\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d said Stephen Curry, who finished with 29 points. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to each other, trying to figure out how we\u2019re going to move on and use this as fuel for Game 3. But other than that, it\u2019s just the playoffs. Everything is heightened. You have to lock into the details that separates champions from the rest.\u201d Saturday\u2019s first-round series opener between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Brooklyn Nets was one Ben Simmons would just as soon forget. In addition to struggling through one of his least productive outings of the season (nine points, seven rebounds, three assists), the Sixers All-Star compounded his no-show by lashing out at the Philadelphia faithful for their, shall we say, less-than-enthusiastic reaction as Game 1 slipped away. (Translation: They followed a time-honored civic tradition and booed the home team for playing poorly.) Simmons walked that criticism back, then took matters into his own hands in Game 2 with his second career playoff triple-double as the 76ers unleashed a record-setting rout on the Nets to even the series at 1-1. The Sixers shattered franchise playoff marks that had stood for 49 and 52 years, respectively, with 51 points in the third quarter and 145 points overall. Their 51 points tied the Lakers\u2019 57-year-old record for the most points ever scored in a playoff quarter, and marked only the third time an NBA team has reached the 50-point threshold in a period. On the individual level, Simmons racked up 18 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists to match Wilt Chamberlain (of course) and Charles Barkley as the lone players in team annals with multiple postseason triple-doubles. Despite the blowout final, the first half was very much a contest as the Sixers took a slim one-point lead into the break. They could largely thank Simmons for that as he either scored or assisted on 13 of their first 26 field goals. He accounted for six more buckets in that blistering third, and the rout was on. At one point during the surge, Simmons delighted the same fans who were expressing their disgust just two days prior by cupping his ear to the crowd like Sixers great Allen Iverson \u2014 who, along with Dikembe Mutombo, was in attendance and enjoying the action courtside. Combined with a handful of other strong performances, including 23 points and 10 rebounds from fellow All-Star Joel Embiid, not even an off night from Jimmy Butler (seven points in 30 minutes) could slow the Sixers machine, or the man who drove it. \u201cI was thinking about the boos from last game,\u201d Simmons said of his Iverson tribute. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of love for this city. I was just showing that. The hustle I try to give every game is not only for my teammates and my family, but for the city.\u201d If you count yourself a fan of Boban Marjanovic\u2019s giant-like exploits, well, you\u2019re not alone. https:\/\/cdn.nba.net\/nba-drupal-prod\/green-wave.gif"},{"id":34256,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/embiid-simmons-aggressive-game-2-ugly-nets","date":"2019-04-16","title":"Embiid, Simmons get aggressive and Game 2 gets ugly for Nets","content":" It took them a game-and-a-half. The Philadelphia 76ers got booed off the floor in their own building in Game 1 on Saturday. They were up just one point at halftime of Game 2, fortunate that Joel Embiid didn\u2019t get ejected late in the second quarter for a violent elbow to the head of Jarrett Allen. But at the start of the third period on Monday, the most talented starting lineup in the Eastern Conference put its initial imprint on the NBA postseason with a 24-4 run that propelled the Sixers to a playoff record-tying 51-point quarter and an easy, 145-123 win to even the series at one game apiece. The Sixers needed just nine offensive possessions to score those 24 points. And they got contributions from all five starters in the game-deciding run. It started innocently enough, with Joel Embiid draining a 10-foot jumper from the left wing when Nets center Jarrett Allen gave him plenty of space to shoot. But then it was defense leading to transition offense. The next two buckets came off of strong 1-on-1 defense and resulted in very similar finishes on the other end of the floor. First, a Tobias Harris stop against Nets rookie Rodions Kurucs led to a fast break in which Ben Simmons stopped at the foul line and fed Embiid cutting down the left side of the lane for an and-one bucket. Then a Simmons contest of a D\u2019Angelo Russell bucket led to another break. This time, Simmons drove all the way to the bucket and found Embiid trailing the play for a dunk. That Embiid made both catches below the free-throw line was important in itself. It showed that he had more bounce and more energy than he displayed in Game 1, when he too often caught the ball near the 3-point line and six of his 15 shots came from outside the paint. He missed all six. In Game 2, 11 of Embiid\u2019s 12 shots came from inside the paint, with the jumper to start the third quarter being the one exception. He still caught the ball outside at times, but didn\u2019t settle for jumpers with the Nets\u2019 defense sagging in the paint. He finished with 23 points in fewer than 21 minutes of playing time, making 8-of-12 shots. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to leave me that much space, I feel like I can do other things with it,\u201d Embiid said afterward about not shooting from the outside. \u201cAnd tonight I just decided to be aggressive.\u201d Simmons was similarly aggressive, recording his second career postseason triple-double (18 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists) after a disappointing performance in Game 1. The onslaught continued after those two Simmons-to-Embiid transition buckets. After a Brooklyn miss, Jimmy Butler set a screen for Harris who got fouled on a pull-up 3. Then Butler deflected a Russell pass, Embiid saved the ball and Harris chased it down. Russell committed a clear-path foul, leading to a four-point possession that finished with Embiid catching the ball at the 3-point line, backing Allen down inside the paint, and draining a short turnaround jumper. \u201cThey got multiple stops in a row,\u201d Russell said, \u201cand we couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d After the Nets finally got a second-half bucket, they went to a zone in an attempt to break the Philly rhythm. But that just got the Sixers\u2019 zone-buster \u2013 J.J. Redick \u2013 involved. He found space on the left side of the floor and beating a Joe Harris close-out with a step-in jumper. When Brooklyn went back to its man-to-man defense, Embiid posted up, rebounded his own miss and drew a foul on Kurucs. More Philly defense led to offense. Pressure from Simmons led Allen to throw an errant pass to Russell. Simmons picked up the loose ball and scored on the break. After the Nets got their third and fourth points of the quarter, they got confused on defense and left Harris open beyond the arc, where he closed the 24-4 run with a 3-pointer. It was a ridiculous offensive display: \u2026 and the Sixers\u2019 leading scorer in Game 1 (Jimmy Butler, 36 points) scored just seven in Game 2. The Sixers\u2019 starting lineup is potent. It\u2019s also big and athletic. That was evident 1) on defense, where contested shots and forced turnovers led to those transition opportunities, and 2) on the glass, where 15 offensive rebounds led to 21 second-chance points. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said before Game 2 that his team was expecting \u201ca haymaker\u201d from the Sixers. He knew what he was talking about. In Game 1, the Sixers\u2019 starters were hampered by Embiid\u2019s knee tendinitis and Redick\u2019s foul trouble. Two nights later, we were all witness to a fully armed and operational battle station. Because Game 2 got out of hand (closing with more than 10 minutes of garbage time), the starting lineup played together for just 9:52 on Monday. But in a total of 19 minutes and 15 seconds with all five Philly starters on the floor through two games, the score is Sixers 63, Nets 32 . Alas, the score of the series is 1-1. The blowout on Monday was worth the same as the Nets\u2019 nine-point win two days earlier. Brooklyn still holds home-court advantage and can be happy with a split on the road. But Embiid looking more like himself and the Sixers more aggressively exploiting the advantages they have in the paint can certainly be a sign of things to come. Philadelphia\u2019s depth remains an issue and the spacing isn\u2019t ideal within that starting group, but when things are clicking, you get a 24-4 run that will change a game \u2026 and maybe the series. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Johnson was caught by TV cameras sitting on the bench and scrolling through his phone late in the fourth quarter and the Sixers losing by double digits. Johnson showed Embiid whatever message was on the phone and then slid the device into his warmup pants pocket. \u201cI just looked down because he said his daughter was extremely sick and he was checking on her,\u201d Embiid said. The Sixers made the easy call and fined Johnson an unspecified amount for conduct detrimental to the team. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we are about,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said. Johnson, who averaged 3.9 points in 51 games, was inactive and apologized for his mistake. \u201cI take full responsibility and will accept the consequences of my actions,\u201d he said. \u201cI also apologize to my teammates, the 76ers organization and the fans for the distraction this has caused.\u201d Embiid scored 22 points and had 15 rebounds and was a late addition to starting lineup because of tendinitis in his left knee that cost him most of the final month of the season. The Nets beat the Sixers 111-102 in Game 1 in a game that was a disaster for the organization before the opening tip. Sixers owner Josh Harris was very noncommittal on Brown\u2019s return for a seventh season on the bench if the team did not make a deep run in the playoffs. Harris said Brown was a \u201cgreat coach\u201d but fell well short of giving him a vote of confidence. \u201cWe think he\u2019s the right leader to take us where we need to go in the playoffs,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the Brooklyn Nets.\u201d But wait, there were more disasters. The Sixers trailed by 17, missed 22 of 25 3-pointers and played more like the castoffs of the early Process days under Brown than a team expected to contend for an Eastern Conference championship. Ben Simmons only took nine shots and scored nine points. JJ Redick and Tobias Harris continued the starters\u2019 malaise with only a combined four baskets and nine points. Simmons also blasted the 20,437 Sixers fans for booing the team for most of the game. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to boo, then stay on that side,\u201d he said. Embiid said the voracious booing that was largely absent during the dark days of the Sixers 10-win season was tough to hear. \u201cI love the fans. I\u2019ve never said anything about them. They show us a lot of love,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI understand why they\u2019re booing. But the fact that it\u2019s after every single miss when shots are not going to fall (every time). I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll play through anything.\u201d So to recap, the Sixers lost home-court advantage, got caught using a cellphone on the bench, admonished fans for booing and refused to give the head coach a vote of confidence.

The mentality now: Share. Always a skilled scorer, the 29-year-old and four-time All-Star has taken his game to another level in San Antonio by taking to the floor with a different approach \u2014 a get-teammates-even-more-involved approach. \u201cSpurs\u2019 way, baby,\u201d said DeRozan, whose team leads 1-0 heading into Game 2 on Tuesday against the second-seeded Denver Nuggets. A year under coach Gregg Popovich has rubbed off on DeRozan , who was acquired in a deal last summer that sent Kawhi Leonard to Toronto. He\u2019s coming off a regular season in which he averaged 21.2 points, 6.2 assists and 6.0 rebounds. Those are the sorts of numbers no Spurs player has averaged for a season. Not David Robinson. Not Tim Duncan. Not Tony Parker. Not George Gervin. Flattering, for sure. \u201cAll the great players who came through this organization, the history, for me to be mentioned in something like that is definitely amazing,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely honored for it.\u201d All that by slightly adjusting his game. There was never a conversation he needed to do so, just a feeling. \u201cTrying to understand my teammates, understand the guys around me,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWhen I did that, understand the amount of shooters I had around me, the amount of scorers I had around me, it was on me to be dominant and find those guys and maximize their skills as well.\u201d His cast includes LaMarcus Aldridge and up-and-coming shooter Derrick White, who had a late steal and free throws to seal Saturday\u2019s 101-96 win at Pepsi Center. These days, DeRozan doesn\u2019t need to hoist up a bunch of shots. In fact, he took 100 less shots this season than a year ago. Gone are the days when he needs to erupt for 30 points to lift a team. The Spurs were 7-6 when he went for 30 or more. In contrast, they were 18-6 when he had eight or more assists. As for his 3-point shooting, he only hit seven \u2013 his last one on Dec. 26 against Denver \u2013 as he took 242 less attempts than in `17-18. \u201cYou think of him as a great scorer, a one-on-one scorer, more of a throwback player,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cDeMar is a great player because he continues to evolve. \u2026 Now you have DeMar DeRozan attacking and living in the paint, drawing a crowd. He\u2019s making the right play, making all of his teammates better, which is a sign of growth, which is a sign of somebody who understands being a selfless player.\u201d The postseason hasn\u2019t always been friendly to DeRozan. He went to the playoffs his last five seasons in Toronto, with one Eastern Conference Final to show for it. \u201cI had a lot of success and a lot of fails in the playoffs,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like my motivation to be able to come start fresh here with a new group of guys. I have a great opportunity.\u201d So far, a good start for DeRozan in this version of the postseason. He played a big role in San Antonio\u2019s win. Sure, with his shooting (6 of 17 for 18 points), and rebounding (12) but even more with his passing (six assists, including three in the fourth quarter). \u201cCan\u2019t be satisfied. Now I want to see what it\u2019s like to be up 2-0 on the road,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality.\u201d Before his arrival in San Antonio, DeRozan thought he\u2019d seen just about everything in hoops. But he quickly realized one thing in working with Popovich \u2014 he hasn\u2019t. \u201cHe gave me something that I thought, I wouldn\u2019t say I thought I knew it all, but gave me a different perspective on the game,\u201d said DeRozan, who notched his first career triple-double against Toronto on Jan. 3, with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. \u201cKnowledge. Small things, from being a good teammate to sharing the ball to different ways of scoring. Just a different type of leadership that he shared with me from Day 1 that I took with me and ran with it.\u201d The preparation is a little different with the Spurs. Not better, not worse, just different. The Spurs have been to the postseason for 22 straight years and have captured five championship rings. \u201cPop just has a certain poise to him,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not much that needs to be said, but what\u2019s said, it\u2019s understood as long as you\u2019re listening and apply it. His calm before the storm is definitely different.\u201d"},{"id":34287,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/enes-kanter-second-chance-trail-blazers","date":"2019-04-15","title":"Enes Kanter making most of second chance with Blazers","content":" PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Looking back on it now, the Trail Blazers were clearly smart to pick up Enes Kanter after he was waived by the New York Knicks. Kanter was brought aboard by Portland as insurance for the final stretch of the season, meant to back up starter Jusuf Nurkic. Then Nurkic broke his leg and Kanter was thrust into a starting role with his new team. After Portland\u2019s playoff-opening victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, Damian Lillard dubbed the 6-foot-11 center the Blazers\u2019 MVP. \u201cHe had a huge presence down the stretch and played a huge part in us winning this game,\u201d Lillard said after Portland\u2019s 104-99 victory Sunday. Kanter finished with 20 points and a career playoff-high 18 rebounds, and was effective on defense against the likes of Russell Westbrook and Paul George. It\u2019s been quite a journey from New York castoff to Portland playoff hero for the seven-year NBA veteran. Kanter, 26, was waived by the Knicks following the trade deadline. Once a starter, he fell out of the rotation altogether when New York \u2014 which finished with the worst record in the league \u2014 turned its focus to younger players. Kanter, who came to the Knicks in 2017 from Oklahoma City in the Carmelo Anthony trade, averaged 14 points and 10.8 rebounds in 115 games over two seasons. The Blazers picked him up just before the All-Star break, envisioning him as the second team center. But on March 25, Nurkic crashed awkwardly to the court during a game at home against the Brooklyn Nets. Nurkic, who was averaging 14.6 points and 10.4 rebounds, broke his leg in two places and was out for the season. Nurkic is a Portland favorite \u2014 fans donated to put up a billboard honoring the \u201cBosnian Beast\u201d after his injury \u2014 but Kanter has since endeared himself, too. Kanter appeared in 23 games with the Blazers in the regular season and started in eight, averaging 13.1 points and 8.6 rebounds. \u201cI was on the worst team in the league and I wasn\u2019t even playing because they thought I was too old to play, and with the situation and all the drama and everything, it was frustrating because I just wanted to go out there and win,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cJust a couple of days ago I looked in the mirror and said I am blessed to be here, with an amazing organization and amazing teammates.\u201d He\u2019s faced challenges beyond the court as well. A native of Turkey, Kanter missed a game in Toronto shortly after joining the Blazers because he felt like his life might be in danger if he left the United States. As a result of his criticism of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Kanter had been labeled a terrorist by his native country. His passport was revoked and Turkey reportedly issued a warrant for his arrest with Interpol. His travel concerns caught the attention of U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, who has urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to tell Turkish leaders that any retribution against Kanter for his criticism of their government would be \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Wyden, the senior senator from Oregon, personally met with Kanter before a game last month. \u201cHere in Rip City, we push back against bullies. We expose them, we try to make sure the world knows what kind of sleazy tactics they\u2019re using. I told Mr. Kanter as Oregon\u2019s senior senator and Oregon\u2019s guy on the senate Intelligence Committee, that I\u2019m in this fight all the way, because we\u2019re a community that values the rights of free speech and free expression, and we don\u2019t walk away when a bully comes in and tries to shove around one of our own,\u201d Wyden said. Kanter hasn\u2019t tempered his criticism. Even after Sunday\u2019s victory he posted to Twitter : \u201cGreat team win today! But feeling sorry for all NBA fans in Turkey as they can\u2019t watch any (hash)NBAPlayoffs games that I\u2019m playing in. (hash)DictatorErdogan government censors even the most loved games on the planet!\u201d The last time Kanter was in the playoffs was with Oklahoma City in 2017. He averaged just over nine minutes a game and at one point cameras appeared to catch Thunder coach Billy Donovan saying to assistant Maurice Cheeks, \u201cCan\u2019t play Kanter,\u201d after the center got dunked on by the Houston Rockets. Kanter said Sunday he\u2019s since talked to Donovan, who told him that he never really said that. He believed him. At this point, however, he\u2019s certainly not dwelling on the past \u2014 either with the Thunder or the Knicks. Kanter is simply grateful the Blazers gave him another chance. \u201cAfter we got the win I was walking to the locker room and I saw the GM Neil (Olshey) and he told me `What a great decision, right?\u201d\u2018 Kanter said. \u201cAnd I said, `I appreciate it.

Vince Goodwill of Yahoo Sports writes that the six-time All-Star\u2019s ailing left knee could keep him out of the first round altogether. Griffin worked out at practice on Monday and per Pistons coach Dwane Casey, Griffin wants to play in Wednesday\u2019s Game 2 ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). He has been lobbying to play, but that decision will be up to the team\u2019s medical staff, Casey said. Griffin has been listed as questionable on the team\u2019s injury point for the past few weeks. After missing three games, he returned for three games, but has been listed with \u201cleft knee soreness\u201d on the injury report. Per Rod Beard of The Detroit News , Griffin said after Game 1 that he\u2019s not choosing himself to sit out of the games he\u2019s missed. \u201dI never like to feel like I\u2019m leaving my guys out there,\u201d Griffin said. \u201dBut I have to do what our organization, our training staff, our doctors think is best, and that is the bottom line.\u201d Griffin said his frustration level is \u201c10 out of 10\u201d and pain isn\u2019t the only problem keeping out of the Pistons\u2019 lineup. \u201cI don\u2019t have a great answer to that. It\u2019s a complicated answer. If it was pain, I would easily play with pain. It\u2019s a complication situation,\u201d Griffin said, per The Detroit News . \u201cIf it was just my decision, I would have played.\u201d When teammate Andre Drummond was ejected in Game 1, Griffin was issued a technical foul for protesting his ejection. Casey said he understood what the referees were doing to keep control of the game but thought a flagrant 1 foul \u2014 instead of the flagrant 2 Drummond received \u2014 would have been more appropriate. \u201dI think it was a flagrant but I don\u2019t think Andre deserved to be out the rest of the game,\u201d Griffin said. \u201dAt least that is my opinion in real time.\u201d Casey said he thought Griffin did not deserve a technical. Griffin said it was frustrating having to watch Game 1 from the sideline. The news regarding Griffin is disastrous for Detroit, which trailed by as many 43 before ultimately falling to Milwaukee 121-86 on Sunday. Griffin, who had played his most regular season games (75) since 2013-14, enjoyed a career campaign while snapping a four-year absence from the All-Star Game. The former No. 1 overall pick averaged 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 5.4 assists while leading the Pistons to a late-season playoff push and just their second postseason berth since 2009. Griffin was visibly frustrated following Sunday\u2019s loss, telling reporters that, \u201cIf it was just my decision, I would have played.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":34284,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-first-round-game-1-analysis","date":"2019-04-15","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Recapping first weekend of 2019 NBA playoffs","content":"John Schuhmann and I break down all of the action from the first weekend of the 2019 NBA playoffs.

That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not qualified. The Cavs have scheduled meetings this week with Dallas assistant Jamahl Mosley and Miami\u2019s Juwan Howard for the job, a person familiar with the team\u2019s plans told The Associated Press on Monday. The interviews are the only ones finalized so far, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the team is not publicly commenting during its search to hire Cleveland\u2019s fifth coach since 2013. Mosley has some connections with the Cavs, spending four seasons as an assistant in Cleveland before joining Dallas\u2019 staff in 2014. He just completed his fifth season with the Mavericks, who promoted him to defensive coordinator before last season. Mosley has risen through the coaching ranks and has extensive background in player development, an essential for the Cavs. After a 19-year NBA playing career, Howard joined Erik Spoelstra\u2019s Heat staff in 2013. He\u2019s also been mentioned as a candidate for the Lakers\u2019 vacancy. The Cavs are looking for a coach since parting ways last week with Larry Drew following a 19-win season. Drew took over in October after Tyronn Lue was fired and did all he could to keep the Cavs competitive amid numerous injuries and an ever-changing roster. General manager Koby Altman has not put any timeline on a search he promised would be expansive. Mosley and Howard were immediately available to meet with the Cavs because their teams are not in the playoffs. Altman and his staff intend to speak with assistants currently in the postseason, with Denver\u2019s Jordi Fernandez, Utah\u2019s Alex Jensen and Portland\u2019s David Vanterpool among the coaches expected to be contacted by the Cavs. \u201cOn our list, there are candidates that are on playoff teams,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be super sensitive to that. But, us being done this early affords us some time to really think this out and want to do it the right way. And being super sensitive to teams that are in the playoffs right now.

With that void in his schedule, \u201cInside The NBA\u201d analyst Charles Barkley again asked James last night to visit the set and analyze games alongside himself, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. \u201cI said this before America, and this is the last time: LeBron James, come into the studio,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nothing to do. The playoffs started yesterday and you\u2019ve got free time. I know you\u2019ve got to pick a coach and a general manager, just put that on the back burner. I\u2019m speaking on behalf \u2014 I\u2019m begging you on behalf \u2014 of Ernie, Kenny and Shaq. \u201cLeBron, how about this? You can leave at halftime of the second game.\u201d James responded to Barkley via Twitter today, writing: \u201cSir Charles, I actually do have a ton going on but I may take you up on your offer. We shall see. #KingInStudio \u201d The Lakers were eliminated from playoff contention with their March 22 home loss to the Brooklyn Nets. For James, this marked the first time since the 2004-05 season that he was not a part of the postseason party. However, roughly two weeks before that, Barkley originally planted the seed of having James on the \u201cInside The NBA\u201d set. \u201cYou think we can get him on the show?\u201d Barkley said on March 8. \u201cLeBron, since you\u2019re going to have some free time once the playoffs start, I\u2019ve got a seat for you. The first weekend of the playoffs, we\u2019ll put you up at a good hotel. We\u2019ll get you a first-class ticket. We always bring players in for the playoffs. You\u2019re not going to be busy for the playoffs, so I\u2019m inviting you here.\u201d \u201cLeBron, you have my number. Shoot me a text, I\u2019ll send you my bank account number if you want me to knock him out for you,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. On Sunday\u2019s show, Smith was protesting Barkley\u2019s offer to allow James to leave at halftime of the second game. Barkley dismissed that and added a few more comments in his plea to James. \u201cIt\u2019s just like when we have regular opinions around here \u2014 Kenny\u2019s opinion don\u2019t matter,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cYou can leave at halftime \u2026\u201d \u201cLeBron, Chuck is begging you.

The offseason has already begun for the Lakers with a flurry of activity. First, team president Magic Johnson stunned the team by abruptly stepping down from his position last week. That was followed by coach Luke Walton and the Lakers mutually agreeing to part ways over the weekend. Walton was not unemployed for long, though, as the Sacramento Kings officially hired him today to fill their coaching vacancy. * * *"},{"id":34283,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kings-hire-luke-walton-coach","date":"2019-04-15","title":"Kings officially hire Luke Walton as coach","content":" SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  \u2014  The Sacramento Kings hired Luke Walton as their coach Monday, just days after the Los Angeles Lakers parted ways with him following three losing seasons. Neither the Kings nor Walton waited long following changes that came just after the end of the regular season. Sacramento fired coach Dave Joerger on Thursday following a 39-43 finish that was the best record for the franchise in 13 years, while Walton was dismissed in Los Angeles a day later when he failed to get the Lakers into the postseason in the first year with LeBron James. Kings general manager Vlade Divac met with Walton on Saturday and the two sides quickly came to the agreement that was formally announced Monday. The 39-year-old Walton was 98-148 in three years with Los Angeles in his first full-time head coaching job. He was 37-45 this season and was unable to make the playoffs even once. Walton also has experience as an assistant for Golden State, helping the Warriors win the 2015 title and then leading the team to a 39-4 record, including 24 straight wins to open the 2015-16 season, as interim coach while Steve Kerr was sidelined following complications from a pair of back surgeries. That performance helped him get the job with the Lakers but he was unable to duplicate that success with a roster with far less talent during his first two years and then again this year, even with James on board. Walton now takes over an up-and-coming team in Sacramento that features several talented young players acquired by Divac: guards De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, forward Marvin Bagley III and center Willie Cauley-Stein. The Kings finished 39-43, nine games out of a playoff spot after being tied for the Western Conference\u2019s eighth seed heading into the final game before the All-Star break. Sacramento had its most wins since going 44-38 in 2005-06 during coach Rick Adelman\u2019s final season. That ended a run of eight straight playoff berths and Sacramento hasn\u2019t been back to the postseason since for the NBA\u2019s longest active drought. Joerger was the ninth coach since Adelman was fired in 2006 and none was able to post a winning record or earn a playoff berth. In fact, since moving to Sacramento before the 1985-86 season, the only winning seasons for the Kings came in Adelman\u2019s eight years at the helm, highlighted by a trip to the Western Conference final in 2002. Divac is now counting on Walton being the one who can get the team back to the level it reached under Adelman, when the Kings were a contender for several years and played an entertaining brand of basketball."},{"id":34309,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-4-14-19","date":"2019-04-15","title":"About Last Night: Blazers still trying, now winning","content":" The Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 early-round frustrations are well documented, and due at least \u2014 in part \u2014 to unlucky draws. Portland\u2019s 2016 and 2017 postseason runs both ended at the hands of the Golden State Warriors, understandable losses to all but the most stubborn. One such fan reprimanded CJ McCollum in 2018, when the Blazers guard defended himself and his team on Twitter by reminding his followers of Golden State\u2019s overwhelming talent. Twitter user Jennifer Williams promptly told McCollum, \u201cWin a playoff game, then talk.\u201d If McCollum was angered by the mandate, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead he simply reassured her, tweeting, \u201cI\u2019m trying, Jennifer.\u201d Those three words of honesty became a viral sensation, one that wasn\u2019t forgotten by ESPN\u2019s Royce Young following Portland\u2019s Game 1 victory over Oklahoma City on Sunday. Young asked McCollum if he had anything to say to Jennifer following the win, to which the Blazers\u2019 guard responded with heartfelt laughter. As video of the exchange went viral, Jennifer made sure to take credit for \u201cinspiring\u201d McCollum and the Blazers in their postseason opener. McCollum, who scored 24 points in the victory, is still enjoying the exchange with the maximum amount of good grace. The free-throw line is hallowed ground to NBA dunkers. Giannis Antetokounmpo joins the immortal athletes that have made that line their own personal springboard. Not since Michael Jordan and Clyde Drexler have we seen such an absurd long-jump defiance of gravity. The play punctuated Milwaukee\u2019s 35-point Game 1 win over Detroit, the Bucks\u2019 largest postseason win since 1971. If all you knew about the Celtics\u2019 84-74 Game 1 victory over the Pacers is the final score, you wouldn\u2019t realize it essentially was a blowout. Indiana\u2019s performance in the third quarter of the physical, low-scoring affair erased the Pacers\u2019 hopes of stealing a game in Boston. With the Pacers up 45-38 at halftime, they managed only eight points in the third quarter. Boston scored 26 and cruised the rest of the way in a game that wasn\u2019t as close as the final score indicates. How bad was the third and the early fourth? Well, Pacers starters had scored only one point in the second half until well into the fourth quarter. The Pacers didn\u2019t make a single 3-pointer in the third. The eight-point quarter marked a postseason franchise low for Indiana. But it\u2019s not a NBA-record low. The New Jersey Nets scored six points in a quarter against Cleveland on May 16, 2007. And several others teams have managed only seven or eight in a quarter since then. The 74-point total is the lowest of the season for the Pacers, who shot 33.3 percent \u2014 also a season low. I mean, if you\u2019re not gonna ask Chris Paul a question, why ask him to come up to the podium at all? Clearly, that\u2019s what Paul thought before leaving Harden to his adoring reporters following Houston\u2019s Game 1 win over Utah. The Pacers\u2019 Thaddeus Young ran half court for a chase-down block on the Celtics\u2019 Al Horford, who had received a long outlet pass in transition in the second quarter. James Harden\u2019s offer was simple: I give you these autographed shoes, you give me a hug. The little girl complied. Moment made. For the first time, both Stephen Curry and brother Seth are both in the playoffs. This is piling up the travel miles for their parents."},{"id":34311,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/griffin-injury-puts-pistons-impossible-situation","date":"2019-04-15","title":"Griffin injury puts Pistons in impossible situation","content":" MILWAUKEE \u2014 All dressed up with no Blake to go. This was going to be daunting enough for the Detroit Pistons, the last team to qualify for the NBA postseason matched up in a No. 1 vs. No. 8 first-round series where the talent and achievement gap between them and the Milwaukee Bucks is a chasm. Then Dwane Casey showed up 90 minutes before tipoff and the first words out of the Detroit coach\u2019s mouth were about Blake Griffin, his sore left knee and the All-Star forward\u2019s unavailability for Game 1 Sunday on the Bucks court at Fiserv Forum. Casey\u2019s first words became for all practical purposes his and the Pistons\u2019 famous last words. Like Griffin, they were non-starters, falling behind 18-4 in the first four minutes and 70-43 by halftime. The final score, 121-86  left in the third quarter . That\u2019s right, Milwaukee won this one with a quarter and a half to spare. The bucket that got the Bucks to 88, by the way, was a breakout slam by Giannis Antetokounmpo that you\u2019ll see a few times on highlight reels, considering how he took off after a couple massive steps from just inside the foul line to throw down the dunk. Would a healthy and available Griffin have made up all that difference Sunday night? Hard to say, but probably not. The Bucks, the only team to reach 60 victories this season, were rested and hungry, and it showed. Griffin\u2019s cohort, center Andre Drummond, was a staggering minus-45 in the 26 minutes he lasted before getting ejected for a flagrant 2 foul with 4:07 to go in the third. That\u2019s when Griffin made his only tangible contribution, getting whistled by referee Pat Fraher for a technical foul for the manner in which he objected to the flagrant 2 replay ruling. Griffin afterward said he was agitated by an uneven application of the rules, specifically citing a Russell Westbrook elbow Pistons reserve center Zaza Pachulia took across the face, while vulnerable in mid-air, against Oklahoma City recently. That was called a flagrant 1. Drummond\u2019s was a two-handed shove that sent Antetkounmpo to the floor as they battled beneath the rim. \u201cIt was flagrant but I don\u2019t think Andre deserved it to be out the rest of the game,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAt least that\u2019s my opinion. If they\u2019re both flagrant 2s, I understand. If [they\u2019re both a] flagrant 1, I understand. But there can\u2019t be that big a disparity between the two.\u201d Of greater concern for now is the disparity between the Bucks (who have injuries of their own and thus need not apologize for Sunday\u2019s thrashing) and the Pistons without Griffin. He missed four of Detroit\u2019s final seven games in the regular season, and now five of eight overall, with what has been termed \u201csoreness.\u201d When he scored 45 points at Oklahoma City April 5, he had been held out from three games and had been out a full week. Two nights later, at Charlotte, Griffin was noticeably hobbled again, shooting 5-of-18 and dragging around a leg so heavily wrapped that one wag described it as \u201cmummified.\u201d Griffin lasted barely a half in the Pistons\u2019 must-win against Memphis on Tuesday and was in street clothes again the next night when his teammates managed to snag the East\u2019s No. 8 seed anyway in New York. Any claim that they\u2019re somehow adapting to Griffin\u2019s absence is false. As Casey said after his team slipped into its 0-1 hole: \u201cYou don\u2019t just replace him\u2026 It\u2019s like them not having Antetokounmpo. It\u2019s a big blow.\u201d Griffin, 30, was reborn this season in Detroit, his first full campaign there after being traded to the Pistons in January 2018. It\u2019s more than his career-best scoring rate (25.3 points per 36 minutes) or personal high .581 true-shooting percentage. As a power forward, he\u2019s become an accomplished ball handler and he has put some real stretch in his game from the perimeter. \u201cHe does so many things for them,\u201d said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cHe can be the ball handler on pick and rolls. They can have big guys coming, setting screens. They can have smaller guys coming, setting screens. He can play 1-on-1 from the post. He\u2019s a significantly improved 3-point shooter, so he\u2019s got a great pump fake-and-go game. \u201cHe\u2019s Blake Griffin. He\u2019s a dynamic offensive player, scorer, athlete.\u201d Trouble is, he\u2019s inactive with no verifiable return in sight . This series could last another two weeks, if it were to go seven games, but there\u2019s no sense of when or if Griffin would be ready. And let\u2019s put it this way: If he\u2019s not ready soon, it won\u2019t be going seven. Or even five. Casey and some players felt the Pistons were too amped up at tipoff for this big developmental step of the postseason. But learning they\u2019d be opening the series without their best player \u2013 and perhaps dealing with this right into their offseason \u2013 had to deflate them as well. \u201cHe was definitely missed,\u201d said Drummond, who refused to answer questions about his shove of Antetokounmpo. \u201cA lot of our points are off the board at the moment.\u201d Guard Wayne Ellington, who shot 2-for-10, said: \u201cObviously we can\u2019t really fathom how big of a blow it is for us. But here we are. We\u2019ve got to do what we\u2019ve got to do. Hopefully Blake will get better and be able to come out there with us, but if not, we\u2019ve got to continue to play.\u201d All season long, the standard by which the severity of injuries are measured is this familiar question: If this was a playoff game, would the guy be playing? Well, this was a playoff game. And Griffin was inactive. No one has thrown around any specific orthopedic terms so far \u2013 like meniscus tear, tendinitis or sprain \u2013 so what Griffin calls a \u201ccomplex situation\u201d has an air of mystery to it. But he made sure to let reporters know afterward that missing Game 1 was not his doing. \u201cIf it was just my decision, I would have played,\u201d he said. Then he repeated it: \u201cIf it was just my decision, I would have played.\u201d If the injury is severe, no one is going to suggest the Pistons put at risk a player who is one of the prime assets. Not in an underdog series where, even if healthy, their odds of topping the Bucks would be long. Until Griffin steps on the court (rather than a treadmill) at something close to full effectiveness, though, this best-of-seven set is going to be provide some teachable moments for Detroit \u2013 in the playoffs for only the second time in 10 years \u2014 and little else. Granted, the Pistons are getting reps without Griffin lately. But they\u2019re 2-6 this season when he doesn\u2019t play, so they\u2019re not necessarily great reps. \u201cThere\u2019s no replacing him,\u201d Ellington said. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But this wasn\u2019t Ali looking down at Sonny Liston and providing a photo op that became legendary. This was Kevin Durant giving the business to Patrick Beverley in the final minutes of a playoff game. For a mouthy LA Clippers guard and physical defender who lives to irritate, this was nothing unusual for Beverley to be in such a situation. As for Durant, this is becoming familiar for the Golden State Warriors\u2019 All-Star \u2026 and no one is sure whether that\u2019s a good thing. Durant has never been known for being quick-tempered and easily aggravated throughout much of his career, until recently. As solid as this season has gone for Durant \u2014 wherein he\u2019s still established as among the game\u2019s top five players and on track for another championship \u2014 it\u2019s been a perplexing one because of his demeanor. Durant has clashed with referees, had an in-game dust-up with teammate Draymond Green , racked up technical fouls at an unprecedented pace (for him), cursed the media multiple times for having the audacity to wonder where he\u2019ll play next season and just conducted a game-long trash-talking session with Beverley in which Warriors coach Steve Kerr admitted Durant \u201ctook the bait.\u201d And so this is a reasonable question: What\u2019s eating Kevin Durant? Asked this Sunday on the eve of Game 2 , Kerr, a perceptive coach who has an answer or theory for almost everything, took a pass. Is Durant feeling angst regarding his free agency this summer? If anything, that should be embraced. Durant will be in high demand and will command a maximum contract that will pay upwards of $200 million. He can stay with the Warriors and flanked by All-Stars and play in a new arena in San Francisco, or move to a place \u2014 New York, perhaps \u2014 he can call his own. Where\u2019s the annoyance in that? On the surface, Durant seemingly has a charmed life, someone who has it all: Unfathomable riches, good health, maybe a third championship soon, adoring fans, the perks that come with being famous, high respect in the basketball world for his skills and a case for being among the greatest players of all time. But there\u2019s obviously something we don\u2019t see or understand that\u2019s causing Durant to become moody. But this was a transformation to a degree. Durant is worshipped at the University of Texas, despite playing only one season there. Folks speak glowingly of his character and especially his generosity by returning and funding athletic programs. In Seattle, his first NBA stop, Durant was an affable young player who showed maturity beyond his years, a trait that followed him to Oklahoma City after the SuperSonics relocated. When a deadly and destructive tornado caused lives to unravel in central Oklahoma in 2013, Durant pledged his time and money to help the recovery efforts. And he teared up at his Kia MVP ceremony in 2014 , thanking his mother and also saluting teammate Russell Westbrook, a relationship that became fractured and combative after Durant defected to Golden State. The first time his personality shift took place publicly came during his exit strategy from OKC to the Warriors during free agency. He was caught off guard by the not-so-favorable reaction, heightened by the presence of social media. Durant\u2019s response was to return fire rather than ignore the noise and clumsily created a burner account to go on the attack. It was astonishing to see: A celebrated and accomplished athlete with global fame trading shots with Bob from Wisconsin. This only fed the perception of Durant being hypersensitive and thin-skinned, caring too much about what others think of him. He took his battles to the media, throwing all reporters (even those who don\u2019t handicap his upcoming free-agent choices) on the firing line, often peppering his scolding with expletives. Other times, Durant became curt and short with his answers during interview sessions, whereas before, he was expansive, thoughtful, engaging and unfailingly friendly. All that matters is what happens between the lines on the court, and yet: Durant had 15 technical fouls this season. That\u2019s one shy of tying Green for league-high and did not do so only because one tech was rescinded by the NBA. His barking at Beverley wasn\u2019t a crime in and of itself. For the most part, Durant had a smile on his face, has known Beverley for years, and the chatter between them Saturday didn\u2019t appear to cross the line or lead to a physical confrontation. But by getting two technicals with his ejection, Durant can only get four more throughout the playoffs before each subsequent technical results in a one-game suspension. Beverley will likely not have a long postseason, but Durant certainly will. Therefore, advantage, Beverley. Will this prove costly for Durant and the Warriors in, say, late May or June, if and when they\u2019re chasing champagne? \u201cI\u2019m in control,\u201d Durant said, dismissing that chance. But at this point, given his pattern of late, nothing is for certain. Kerr discussed the importance of keeping cool in the presence of Beverley and anyone else, for that matter. \u201cThat\u2019s two technicals,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYou get seven technicals, your seventh one is a suspension in the playoffs, whether you play four playoff games or 24, seven is the magic number. So, he\u2019s got four to play with after one game. And that\u2019s what Beverley does. \u201cWe talked about it the last couple days. He\u2019s a hell of a defender who plays hard. We have a lot of respect for him. But you cannot take the bait because that\u2019s a bad trade for us. You just can\u2019t do it. The Clippers have made a lot of good trades this year, and that was maybe their best.\u201d Yes, because although the victory was already in hand for the Warriors, a seed was planted by Beverley. Neither Kerr or Durant believe Beverley will get under the skin of the two-time Finals MVP again. The bigger picture lies with the games beyond the first round, assuming the Warriors move forward. The Durant we see before us today is edgier, saltier, more willing to express himself in ways that aren\u2019t always productive. Durant has gone hardcore, and it certainly makes him more interesting, though to what end? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

In stunning fashion, the Nets\u2019 assortment of underrated role players won out over the Sixers\u2019 star-studded lineup in the 2019 playoffs opener, stealing Game 1 and Philadelphia\u2019s homecourt advantage in the process. Brooklyn\u2019s most iconic former outcasts led the way: D\u2019Angelo Russell, the once-traded No. 2 overall pick, and Caris LeVert, acquired two weeks after draft day in a calculated gamble as a series of not-yet-rehabilitated leg injuries had significantly dropped his stock. The duo finished with 49 total points \u2014 more than any three Sixers not named Jimmy Butler (36 points). The victory was symbolic of Brooklyn\u2019s season \u2014 unrelenting and full of feel-good chemistry. The opposite could be said of Philadelphia, which suffered a nightmarish outing from everyone save No. 23. Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris and JJ Redick combined for just 18 points. Joel Embiid\u2019s 22 came on 5-for-15 shooting. Even with their playoff opener descending into disappointment, Embiid and Amir Johnson found themselves-more interested in cell phone activity than how their teammates were faring. By the end of the night, Sixers fans could be heard booing the contender they waited years to witness. Simmons didn\u2019t mince words on the subject after the game. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to boo, stay on that side,\u201d Simmons warned. The Nets will do all they can to keep them there. Brooklyn\u2019s effort (23 second-chance points) and accuracy (11-for-26 from 3) made for a sound recipe against this Sixers team. And unlike Philadelphia, the Nets\u2019 stars got plenty of help. For Philadelphia, the question is already looming heading into Game 2: Can they still trust \u201cThe Process\u201d? The Sixers clearly thought they would hold serve on home court. Unfortunately, those plans \u2014 and the accompanying celebration \u2014 went unfulfilled. Ever since he was drafted No. 9 overall in 2008, DJ Augustin has been the point guard just good enough to get, but not good enough to keep. Orlando is his eighth NBA stop, the longest one since he left Charlotte in 2012. He entered this season as the Magic\u2019s full-time starter \u2026 because there was no one else. But something funny happened in Orlando\u2019s playoff opener at second-seeded Toronto. Down the stretch, the Magic organically seemed to realize that Augustin (along with former Raptor Terrence Ross) was one of their only players with significant postseason experience and confidence. Those peaked with 4.2 seconds left, when Augustin drilled the game-winning 3 in Orlando\u2019s shocking 104-101 Game 1 victory. Augustin wasn\u2019t the only castoff point guard to prove himself on the big stage. Former Kia Rookie of the Year and thrice-traded Michael Carter-Williams was solid off the bench (10 points, five rebounds, two assists), even if the outing was marred by an errant Kyle Lowry arm. At this point, it\u2019s too eerie to ignore. Kyle Lowry just isn\u2019t himself when a playoff series tips off. The five-time All-Star missed all seven of his shot attempts in Saturday\u2019s loss, finishing with zero points.  Lowry is now averaging 9.7 points, 6.4 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 32.5-percent shooting and 18.6 percent from beyond the arc across 12 career Game 1s. Maybe LeBron should give Derrick White a call \u2026 White was much more than a four-star highlight, serving as one of the Spurs\u2019 few efficient sources of offense in their Game 1 upset at second-seeded Denver. He is most recognized for his defense, and he cemented that reputation with the game-clinching steal in the final seconds. It sounds more like a throwback sitcom than a budding playoff rivalry, but Beverley\u2019s physicality meeting Durant\u2019s dominance produced some memorable photos and a double-ejection before the night was over.      "},{"id":34310,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-have-no-answer-warriors-series-opener","date":"2019-04-14","title":"Clippers have no answer for mighty Warriors in opener","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 On the first day of the NBA playoffs, a familiar sound was heard, a warning actually, and it was tim-ber ! Heavily-favored and highly seeded teams falling in unlikely places, and then the Golden State Warriors began defense of their back-to-back championships, and you know what dropped to the floor? In order: Stephen Curry right on his wallet after swishing a long distance 3-pointer that shook the building; Patrick Beverley after colliding with and then having to hear about it from a trash-talking Kevin Durant; and finally, any faint hopes the Clippers might have had to make this first-round series even remotely interesting. Yes, while madness reigned in other playoff cities, Oakland enjoyed a ray of reality. Warriors vs. Clippers could very well be the lone mismatch in these playoffs because simple arithmetic says so. Five stars for the Warriors going against zero stars for the Clippers equals a four-game sweep, or at least it seems. At 121-104 Warriors, Game 1 was pretty much a wash, with the only drama being the game within the game. Specifically: Pat Bev being Pat Bev. Beverley is the NBA\u2019s resident porcupine, bringing a prickly exterior designed to rub folks the wrong way. His purpose is to disrupt with defense, and he is among the league\u2019s best at that, and also with chatter, which he uses to get under more skin than a tattoo. Clippers coach Doc Rivers made the curious if gutsy decision to use Beverley at times as a second layer of defense against Durant. That\u2019s a salute to Beverley; although the guard gives away seven inches to Durant, he works hard to minimize that disadvantage but mostly, the Clippers have no one better to offer on the double team. Besides, the genius behind Rivers\u2019 ploy was knowing Beverley would not hesitate to use some snarl and try to get Durant or maybe Curry to take the bait. \u201cI just competed out there,\u201d said Beverley. \u201cThis is the playoffs.\u201d And so, Beverley nearly became hoarse after so much trash talking to Durant, who was only too willing to send it back. For three quarters it was entertaining. By the fourth quarter, it was tiring, because a pair of incidents resulted in technical fouls and eventually the ejection of both. First: Beverley rose and successfully challenged Durant\u2019s shot at the rim, and when the ball bounced out of bounds, Beverley jumped on the chance to get into Durant\u2019s ear. Next: Minutes later, as both players chased a loose ball, Durant collided with Beverley, sending the guard into the scorer\u2019s table and then the floor, where Durant stood over him and taunted him. That was enough for veteran referee Ed Malloy, who rushed over and tossed both players. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional play, so he\u2019s going to show his intensity after that [first] play,\u201d said Durant. \u201cIt was the same play for me on the other end when I had an opportunity to bring some intensity to the game and for my team. I thought that was the perfect time to do so.\u201d What Malloy doesn\u2019t realize, or didn\u2019t care to, is that Beverley never gets into a fight and doesn\u2019t throw anything more harmful than an insult. Likewise, Durant had a grin on his face when he got into Beverley\u2019s face. But just to be safe, and also to send a message for the rest of the series, Malloy bounced both. Durant later expressed a measure of respect for Beverley\u2019s incendiary approach to the game. \u201cHe\u2019s a Chicago kid,\u201d said Durant. \u201cBrings a different type of grit. I have to appreciate that. We all know what he brings to the table, with his physicality, mucking up the game with his physicality and talking \u2026 that what he brings, that\u2019s his identity.\u201d The Clippers have bigger problems than Durant, namely Curry, who once again became a handful for the Clippers; he averaged 32 points on 54 percent shooting against LA this season. On Saturday he scored 38 points on only 16 shots, and just for good measure chipped in a career-high 15 rebounds and seven assists. It was an all-around display of efficiency from Curry, and a historical one as well, as he passed Ray Allen for first place on the all-time career playoff list for most 3-pointers made. \u201cCurry has destroyed us all year, he really has,\u201d said Rivers. As is his custom when he\u2019s rolling, Curry hit shots from all sorts of weird angles and distances, each getting a rise from the Oracle Arena crowd. And it underlined the problem faced by the Clippers. If they choose to double Durant, there are times when Curry will punish them. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve seen this so much from him, it\u2019s just another night at the office,\u201d said Durant. So that\u2019s the tone set for this series. The Warriors bringing more firepower and star power, plan to overwhelm the Clippers with both and finish off the No. 8 seed as quickly as possible. Given that the Clippers\u2019 two most productive players, Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, both come off the bench (they combined for 51 points), the Clippers will be under a bit of pressure to start games with a stronger surge, or else spend the rest of the night swimming uphill against a better team. They\u2019ve defied logic during a regular season that saw them overachieve and nearly reach 50 wins despite trading their leading scorer, Tobias Harris, at the deadline. But this is a whole \u2018nother level here in the playoffs, where the intensity rises and the Warriors suddenly get serious about basketball and where stars rule. On a night where the Nets, Spurs and Magic all pulled surprises against higher seeds in their playoff openers, the Clippers went quietly and rather expectedly. \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d said Beverley. \u201cWe didn\u2019t back down, we won\u2019t back down.\u201d Well, true, when it came to standing toe-to-toe and talking a good game, the Clippers were nearly equal to the Warriors. That makes for a nice sideshow, a diversion, a splash of spice that creates a level of hostility that can be entertaining. Yet this is Big Boy Basketball now, and you need a few great players to pull you through, and an experienced hand when one is needed, and a feeling of belonging. The Warriors bring all of that, and more; they don\u2019t play down to the competition in the playoffs. What are the Clippers bringing? Well, it better be something we haven\u2019t seen yet, or else this series will be shorter than Beverley\u2019s temper. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Ben Simmons is a monster of a point guard. J.J. Redick is one of the best shooters in NBA history. And Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris are the kind of versatile perimeter players that every team is looking for. But, even with the mid-season additions of the latter pair, the Sixers still depend on one guy a lot more than any of the others. They still go as Joel Embiid goes. And in Game 1 of their first round series against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, Embiid did not go very well. The Nets took advantage, home-court and overall, with a 111-102 victory . Still dealing with a knee issue that kept him out of 14 of the Sixers\u2019 24 games after the All-Star break, Embiid struggled to get up and down the floor. He finished with a looks-pretty-good line of 22 points, 15 rebounds, four assists and five blocks, but wasn\u2019t nearly as dominant as he had been previously against Brooklyn, when he averaged 30 points on 60-percent shooting in the regular season series. Things started out well enough. Getting the ball inside, Embiid drew four fouls on the Nets and scored seven points in the first 3 1\/2 minutes of Game 1. But the \u201cgetting the ball inside\u201d part was the key, and that didn\u2019t happen nearly enough after those first few minutes. Over the remainder of Game 1, Embiid caught the ball within 15 feet of the basket just 12 times. And he either made a shot or drew a foul after 11 of those 12 catches. Nets starting center Jarrett Allen was helpless in trying to deal with Embiid\u2019s superior size and strength. But 12 catches near the basket wasn\u2019t enough. Twice as often, Embiid caught the ball beyond or in the vicinity of the 3-point line. In stark contrast to his interior success, only five of those 24 outside catches resulted in a score for the Sixers. Embiid shot 5-for-9 in the paint and 0-for-6 outside it . He went 0-for-5 from 3-point range in the first 14 minutes of the game and then got hesitant. The Sixers couldn\u2019t get Embiid the ball inside, in no small part because he couldn\u2019t get inside himself. Sluggish and seemingly not in great shape, he was almost always the last man down the floor on offensive possessions. So he kept catching the ball as a trailer 25 feet from the basket. Embiid did shoot 5-for-7 from 3-point range in the last two regular-season meetings between these two teams. But over the full season, Embiid had an effective field goal percentage of just 41 percent on shots outside the paint. That ranked 143rd among 146 players who attempted at least 300 shots from the outside. The Nets will happily take him shooting the ball from the perimeter, and that\u2019s how they defended him on Saturday. The soft coverage on Embiid can provide an opportunity for Redick. If Embiid\u2019s defender is in the paint, there\u2019s nobody to help when he executes a dribble hand-off with an aggressive Redick looking to shoot. But the Brooklyn guards did a good job of fighting through those handoff screens and keeping Redick from getting free too often. He shot just 2-for-7 (1-for-4 from 3-point range) in Game 1 and the Nets more often took advantage of him on the other end of the floor. Game 2 is Monday at 8 ET (TNT). If the Sixers can\u2019t count on a healthy Embiid, they need a more clear Plan B. The Nets might also be happy if the Sixers don\u2019t run that much pick and roll. Brooklyn was a slightly better than average defensive team this season, with a scheme that tried to force ballhandlers to shoot between the restricted area and the 3-point line. That scheme can be taken advantage of by ballhandlers who can shoot well off the dribble. The only player who scored more points against Brooklyn than Embiid this season was, not coincidentally, Kemba Walker . Brooklyn gave up a league-high 21.6 points per game to pick-and-roll ballhandlers, according to Synergy play tracking. But the Sixers are not a pick-and-roll team. In fact, only the Warriors averaged fewer pick-and-roll ballhandler possessions than Philadelphia ( 13.1 per game ). Jimmy Butler had some success in the pick and roll in Game 1, scoring 15 points on 12 ballhandler possessions. But the Sixers primary playmaker (Simmons) is not a shooter, and if he\u2019s on the floor while somebody else is running pick and roll, Simmons\u2019 defender can help in the paint. The Sixers\u2019 two most-used lineups were a plus-19 in 22 minutes in Game 1: But the game was lost in the Sixers\u2019 transitional lineups. All other Philly lineups were outscored by 28 points in about 26 minutes in Game 1. The Sixers\u2019 starters can be impossible to match up against. But because Philly coach Brett Brown likes to have at least two starters on the floor at all times, the minutes in which all five starters are on the floor are limited. Now, that 9.4 minutes is exceedingly low. With the gimpy Embiid in pain, he played just 24:15 on Saturday, far less than you would normally ask of your most important player in a playoff game. Redick, meanwhile, fouled out in less than 23 minutes of playing time. Still, staggering the starters means that the Sixers will have reserves on the floor for most of the game. And that\u2019s when Philly pays the price for sacrificing depth in the Butler and Harris trades. With Redick in foul trouble and James Ennis out with a quad contusion, the Sixers called on Jonathon Simmons, a player who ranked 273rd in effective field goal percentage among the 274 players who attempted at least 300 shots this season. In Game 1, the Sixers were outscored by 16 points in 11:26 with Simmons on the floor. The Brooklyn reserves, meanwhile\u2026 This was clearly LeVert\u2019s best game since his return from a nasty leg injury. He scored 23 points on 8-for-18 shooting, connecting on all three of his 3-point attempts. He\u2019s a slippery guard who can get to the paint and to the line when he\u2019s feeling confident, especially against this Sixers\u2019 defense. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of matchups,\u201d LeVert said, \u201cthat we like to exploit.\u201d Dudley took some credit for LeVert\u2019s improved play. \u201cWe threw him in the starting lineup,\u201d Dudley said of LeVert\u2019s initial comeback. \u201cHe was trying to find his rhythm. At that time, I wasn\u2019t even playing, getting DNPs. I remember telling coach to let me play with him, get him more minutes, more touches, more screens. And I think he just figured it out naturally. He got in more of a rhythm moving to the second unit.\u201d The numbers back Dudley up. With Dudley on the floor after his return, LeVert averaged 18.8 points per 36 minutes , shooting 42 percent , with a free-throw rate of 29 attempts per 100 shots from the field. With Dudley off the floor, he averaged 15.0 points per 36 minutes, shooting 38 percent, with a free-throw rate of just 19 attempts per 100 shots from the field. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award, the National Basketball Coaches Association announced today. The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award recognizes the dedication, commitment and hard work of NBA Head Coaches and is presented annually to a Head Coach who helps guide his players to a higher level of performance on the court and shows outstanding service and dedication to the community off the court. It honors the spirit of Michael H. Goldberg who set the standard for loyalty, integrity, love of the game, passionate representation and tireless promotion of NBA coaching. It is unique in that it is the only award voted upon by the winners\u2019 peers, the Head Coaches of all 30 NBA teams. The voting for this year\u2019s award once again illustrates the depth of coaching excellence in the NBA, as 8 of the 30 Head Coaches received votes. In addition to Budenholzer, the following Coaches also received votes: Kenny Atkinson, Michael Malone, Nate McMillan, Gregg Popovich, Doc Rivers, Quin Snyder and Terry Stotts. \u201cThe Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award for the top NBA Coach as voted by his peers is one of the most meaningful in all of pro sports,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks Head Coach and National Basketball Coaches Association President Rick Carlisle. \u201cMike Budenholzer in his first year as Head Coach of the Bucks, led the franchise to the top record in the entire NBA. Congratulations to Bud on this prestigious recognition.\u201d In just his first year with the Bucks, Coach Mike Budenholzer guided the team to the best record in the NBA, 60-22. This season the Bucks had their best record since 1980-81, the last time Milwaukee had 60 regular season wins. The Bucks also captured their first divisional title since 2000-01. Their record of 60-22 was a 16 victory improvement over last season, the second best improvement in the league. The Bucks were the only team to rank in the top four in both offensive and defensive rating, and had the best net rating (+9.0) in the NBA. Budenholzer and his coaching staff were the Coaches for Team Giannis at the 2019 NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte. He was also the Head Coach of the Eastern Conference team at the 2015 NBA All-Star Game. In six seasons as a head coach, Budenholzer has a 273-219 coaching record and a winning percentage of .555. \u201cIt is an incredible honor to be recognized by your peers, and that makes this award truly special,\u201d said Milwaukee Bucks Head Coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cThank you to my colleagues across the NBA, and most importantly thank you to our players and staff in Milwaukee. The players\u2019 and staffs\u2019 work this year has given our team and our fans a very special season. \u201cMichael H. Goldberg was a mentor and a friend to me for many years as he helped me grow to this moment. My staff and I are grateful for all he and the NBA Coaches Association have done and continue to do for coaches in the NBA.\u201d The National Basketball Coaches Association, and its entire membership, congratulates Coach Budenholzer on his impressive season. The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award trophy will be presented to him at the NBCA Annual Meeting of Head Coaches in September. \u201cI had the good fortune of working alongside Michael H. Goldberg each and every day. Michael was incredibly generous with his wisdom, advice, guidance and time,\u201d said David S. Fogel, NBCA Executive Director.  \u201cThe Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award is presented each year to the Head Coach who exemplifies the same high level of integrity and excellence that Michael displayed during his highly successful career. Coach Budenholzer exemplifies these values on and off the court, and his tireless work ethic led to one of the most successful seasons in Bucks franchise history. Congratulations to Coach Budenholzer and the entire Bucks Coaching Staff, this honor is well deserved.\u201d The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award is named after the esteemed long-time Executive Director of the National Basketball Coaches Association. The NBCA encompasses all Head and Assistant Coaches in the NBA, and its alumni. In 1980, just four years after the NBCA was founded, Michael H. Goldberg became its first Executive Director. Building on the existing foundation of the NBCA, he guided it during the years of the greatest growth in professional basketball. He helped gain significant benefits for NBA Coaches, including increased retirement funds and disability insurance. Prior to the NBCA, Goldberg was General Counsel of the American Basketball Association. The prior recipients of the Michael H.

Goodbye, \u201cload management.\u201d That\u2019s the hope, anyway. That odd term, coined to cover otherwise healthy players sitting out a game here, a game there \u2013 or maybe a dozen or more of the 82 their teams actually are scheduled to play \u2013 is intended strictly for the regular season. The idea that a top performer would be held out for a night in the thick of a best-of-seven playoff series seems so self-defeating and wrong, even by 2019 standards, that it would be highly unlikely. It was a nagging issue for six months, though, watering down some games\u2019 mix of competition and entertainment. And when the season\u2019s days dwindled to a precious few, the matter of who played and who rested affected more than just the teams on that court, the folks in that building and the audience tuned in to that particular game.  Now other teams had a vested interest. Scoreboard-watching down the stretch, they might see that a rival for a playoff berth or seeding position had caught a break, its opponent that night sitting out starters. Didn\u2019t seem very porting. \u201cI\u2019m never quite comfortable where things are at,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Friday when discussing the topic at some length after the spring Board of Governors meeting . \u201cI think especially over that last week, you can imagine there\u2019s a fair amount of angst in the league office.\u201d Silver acknowledged that teams \u2013 both those seeking guidelines for how to rest key players without playoff implications and those upset when those very situations arose \u2013 had been \u201ccalling our general counsel Rick Buchanan or calling Mark Tatum or calling me.\u201d Said Silver: \u201cThere aren\u2019t always bright-line answers we can give them. We always have one eye, too, that we know that the playoffs are what this is all about. So we don\u2019t want to end up forcing a team to do something silly when it could cause issues in terms of health for the most important part of the season.\u201d The challenge of seeking a solution suitable to all is daunting, though. Enough so that Silver launched into a discussion of what might be considered drastic ideas about changing or shortening the 82-game season in the future.  For instance, shorter seasons. Or shorter games. Or some sort of in-season tournaments modeled after international soccer seasons. \u201cThose are all things we\u2019re looking at,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the kinds of format changes you\u2019re going to make without lots and lots of deliberation. \u201c Silver said that at this week\u2019s meetings, Byron Spruell, NBA president of basketball operations, made a presentation about such format changes. Understandably, any major overhaul of the product would require cooperation of the teams and the players, and likely need time \u2013 \u201cfive years out, six years out,\u201d Silver said \u2013 before implementation. The NBA in recent seasons has taken steps aimed at lessening player workloads, such as lessening the number of back-to-back schedules, pumping the All-Star break to a week and stretching the league calendar to allow more days between games. And still, stars such as Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis or LeBron James were frequent scratches throughout 2018-19, held out for rest, for general soreness or to preserve their future value as assets.  \u201cSometimes it\u2019s science, but sometimes it\u2019s art,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI think a fair point from fans could be if ultimately the science suggests that 82 games is too many games for these players, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have an 82-game season. I accept that, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to look at.\u201d The suggestion of a play-in tournament before the playoffs has been rattling around NBA headquarters for years. A more recent notion has been a midseason tournament of some sort. Both presumably would mean that some teams would be idled for some number of days. Keeping the NBA game popular with fans, especially those consuming as TV viewers or users across other platforms, is a priority close behind player health. Changing viewership and new competition, Silver said, demand that the league consider new ways of presenting the game. That could mean the start of new traditions.  \u201cWe and the players have a common interest in maximizing viewership and maximizing interest,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cThe format we have in place now\u2026 I\u2019m a traditionalist on one hand, but on the other hand it\u2019s 50 years old or so, presenting an 82-game season, and there\u2019s nothing magical about it.\u201d Among other topics touched on in his news conference, Silver paid tribute to Miami\u2019s Dwyane Wade and Dallas\u2019 Dirk Nowitzki, both retiring after surefire Hall of Fame careers. \u201cTwo guys, very different backgrounds, very different styles of play, very different approaches,\u201d Silver said, \u201cbut just incredibly wonderful guys who the league office has worked closely with over many years and who I have no doubt will now find different ways to engage directly with the league as retired NBA players.\u201d There was another farewell of sorts Tuesday when Lakers legend Magic Johnson suddenly resigned as that team\u2019s president of basketball operations. Like so many others, Silver learned what was happening in real time, when he got a text urging him to turn on Johnson\u2019s impromptu media session carried live on NBA TV. The two have been in touch since. \u201cUltimately, I want what\u2019s best for Magic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cHe\u2019s been an incredible ambassador for this game. \u2026 In some ways, we\u2019re getting him back.\u201d If Johnson were to stay \u201cunattached\u201d from the Lakers, Silver said, he could mentor \u201ca next generation of players.\u201d Without fear of running afoul of tampering rules, as Johnson did in comments he made about Paul George and Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cSo I don\u2019t view him as exiting the league in any way,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cIn fact, I see it as him re-engaging in other ways.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They had the league\u2019s best record and its best point differential by a wide margin. They ranked in the top four on both ends of the floor, the first Eastern Conference team to hold that distinction in the last nine years. Given how dominant the Bucks were over the last six months (and the fact that they have the East\u2019s best player), the Bucks should be the clear favorite to reach The Finals out of the East. But this is a core group that has yet to win a playoff series. Giannis Antetokounmpo has been to the postseason in three of the last four years, and has been dispatched in the first round each time. Of course, the Detroit Pistons haven\u2019t won a single playoff game in the last 10 years. And while the Bucks will begin the postseason without starting guard Malcolm Brogdon, the Pistons could be in even worse shape, with All-Star Blake Griffin dealing with a knee injury that kept him out of the last game and a half of the regular season, when Detroit needed two wins to just get into the playoffs.

More important, though, what really needs to be known is, who\u2019s running the Lakers? As the famous franchise stumbles to regain a toe hold and especially a measure of credibility it once had, it will be dogged by the leadership question until \u2026 well, it isn\u2019t. Such has been life for the Lakers ever since the passing of Jerry Buss in 2013 and the passing of the franchise to the hands of his children. With Dr. Buss, this was never an issue or a concern. Even during those brief stretches under his watch when the Lakers weren\u2019t as fabulous as the former arena that once housed them, you knew it was only a matter of time. And, there was never a sign of dysfunction at all, at least beyond the personality clash between Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant. It was Dr. Buss and Jerry West running a steady ship, and after West left, Mitch Kupchak for a while helped maintain the standard of front office stability and competency. The Lakers remained a destination franchise and among the best-run in the NBA, and now after six losing seasons including a chaotic last few, that track record has run off the track. By the end of next week if not sooner, the Lakers will get around to finding the replacement for Walton and it very well could be an upgrade especially if it\u2019s Monty Williams, a promising up-and-comer before a tragic family accident put his life on pause, or Ty Lue, who brings a championship ring and a working relationship with LeBron James. And that\u2019s fine. However: What exactly is the front office flow chart and the philosophy going forward? After Magic Johnson chose to retreat, ever so embarrassingly, from that responsibility so he could be \u201cMagic Johnson\u201d again, the task of giving Walton the bad news Friday was left to Rob Pelinka. Actually, Walton jumped just as he was being pushed because his departure was a mutual decision, and who could blame Walton? Once a handful of other jobs opened in the NBA the last few days, he had choices; the Kings are a sure bet because Vivek Ranadive knew Walton when both were with the Warriors before Ranadive bought the Kings. Yes, it has come to this: A coach would be happier with the Kings than Lakers, words that have never been written before. The fate of the Lakers belongs to Jeanie Buss, who must make the leadership call \u2014 is it Pelinka, most famously known as Kobe Bryant\u2019s agent, or someone else? \u2014 and somehow restore the luster of the franchise and the faith of the fans. This will be interesting if only because Buss is new to this. Until two years ago when she wrestled control of the club from her brother Jim, to the delight of many, Jeanie was mainly on the marketing side. That was her duty in the mom-and-pop organization, which has remained in the family during Dr. Buss\u2019 time and after. Other than her relationship with former coach Phil Jackson, Jeanie Buss didn\u2019t mingle in an official capacity with the movers and shakers around the league. That is, get to know and deal with the top agents and general managers and assorted other power brokers who have a hand in the NBA jar. And after the Laker family takeover, she was a package deal with Magic and therefore didn\u2019t interview outside candidates. From that appearance, Buss kept the Lakers within the family, so to speak, because it was more comfortable for her to do so with her brother from another mother. She could trust Magic, someone she\u2019s known since both were teenagers, someone who showed a weird way to repay that trust when he dropped the bomb this week without telling her first. And so: Does Jeanie Buss want to stray from her comfort zone and look outside the organization for help in this, a high-alert time of crisis? Or will she lean on Kobe\u2019s former agent, and maybe Kobe himself behind the scenes, neither of whom bring vast experience on the personnel side? We will see how Jeanie Buss responds to that pressure. Remember, she grew disenchanted with the Lakers under her brother Jim after too many poor decisions in Kobe\u2019s sunset years, and heard a standing ovation when she won the tug-of-war. There was much applause for her from fans forced to live through Timofey Mozgov, Luol Deng, Dwight Howard and a gimpy Steve Nash. But applause can fade quickly, and so can credibility, even with LeBron James in the fold. The Lakers failed to deliver a punch in what\u2019s been a letdown season, unless you count the one to their own jaw. LeBron\u2019s groin injury can be excused for a losing record and no playoff appearance, but not the aftermath including the bad losses to bad teams; the pitiful Anthony Davis chase and the lousy morale caused by it; the Magic disappearing act and depending on which side you sit, the Walton mutual good-bye. You wonder if all of this Laker vulnerability will create an opening for an opportunistic power play led by \u2014 who else, LeBron And Friends. Because more than before, LeBron has power and that, based on the past, isn\u2019t always what\u2019s best for the team he represents. That power caused uneasiness in Cleveland during his first stint with the Cavs. It was effectively snuffed by Pat Riley in Miami and the result was a pair of championships. But when LeBron returned to the Cavs, he had his way again, this time with the player agency he created. Suddenly, clients were given fat contracts and roles, and while it resulted in a championship, the fallout was lasting. Stuck with those contracts, the Cavs cratered this season and the only silver lining is they were bad enough to position themselves for the No. 1 pick and draft someone \u2014 hint, he\u2019s a Duke guy \u2014 who could ease the pain. Unless of course, the Lakers get lucky with a frozen ping-pong ball at the Draft Lottery and keep alive the tradition of importing generational stars. The task of shedding a layer of dysfunctional skin isn\u2019t all about luck, unfortunately, and the Lakers will discover this if they haven\u2019t already. It requires a deft hand and gutsy decisions that elevate a franchise and command respect. This is what the Lakers are up against. This is what they must do to salvage what\u2019s left of LeBron\u2019s career and reassure folks that their current predicament is just a momentary phase. The Lakers need Jeanie Buss to walk in that door with a whole lot more confidence-inspiring swagger and strut than Magic Johnson and Luke Walton showed when walking out. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

If only it were that simple for the rest of us who witnessed that Game 7 debacle, when the Rockets missed a mind-blowing 27 straight 3-pointers, and watched the Golden State Warriors snatch any hopes the Rockets had of supplanting them as the cream of the Western Conference crop and replacing them in The Finals. The Rockets are convinced they were a healthy Paul hamstring away from The Finals a year ago. Nothing will change their minds about that. So they started this season with that belief in the back of their minds, even if it didn\u2019t manifest itself in the way they played. Even when they were 11-14 and sorting through injuries and issues at the start of this season, they insist their confidence didn\u2019t waiver. Not with Paul and reigning Kia MVP James Harden leading the way, not with the emotional scars from yet another failed coup attempt overflowing amongst the returning core members of the group. That\u2019s why everything that\u2019s transpired since then \u2014 Harden\u2019s rescue ranger routine since that uneven start, the injuries to Paul, Eric Gordon and center Clint Capela that threatened to derail the revival, the additions of Austin Rivers, Iman Shumpert and Kenneth Faried to a deeper and perhaps more versatile supporting cast \u2014 has only served to embolden this crew. They\u2019ve already been humbled on the biggest stage, with everything on the line they fell hard. What could be worse than that? The only thing to do, if your \u201cswag\u201d is on overload the way Harden swears it remains, is to plot the course for another shot at the Warriors. So it comes a little earlier than expected, if the Rockets handle their business in a first-round matchup against Utah and the Warriors do the same against the LA Clippers they\u2019ll see each other in the conference semifinals. That\u2019s fine for a team whose vision is not just with challenging the Warriors but ending and replacing them. \u201cYou know what\u2019s crazy?\u201d Rockets swingman P.J. Tucker said. \u201cAs much as possible, from the very start, we just tried to block it out of our minds, what went down. Because when you get that close and your team is feeling that good, like we were on top of our game, our swagger was high, and we had a great season and playoffs before Chris got hurt \u2026 we had to block it out of our minds. Because this is really a whole new team this year, a completely different journey. And that\u2019s the one thing we said we were going to emphasize this year. We were not going to suffer from that hangover, that feeling of being right there but not quite getting there. \u201cNo matter how it ends, for whoever wins the championship and everybody else, you\u2019ve got to go through it all over again. There\u2019s a whole new grind waiting on you. We knew what it took to have the kind of season we did have, and we were adamant about not getting caught up in our feelings like that, we\u2019re not going to focus on that. It\u2019s a whole new year.\u201d The lessons learned didn\u2019t manifest themselves in performance through the first quarter of this season. The Carmelo Anthony experiment went awry quickly. That made the scapegoating easy for anyone looking to go that route, but it didn\u2019t fix what ailed these Rockets when they were sitting 14th in the standings before Christmas. That was heavy lifting designed for Harden, whose season really cranked up with a mid-December 50-point triple-double torching of the Los Angeles Lakers at Toyota Center, the start of a run of 32 straight games that saw Harden score 30 or more points, the longest such stretch the NBA had seen since Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s day destroying the competition in the early 1960s. Harden realized he had no choice but to go there, immediately and every night out, if this particular Rockets team was serious about another run at the Warriors throne. \u201cI didn\u2019t like where we were at and as the leader of this team, one of the leaders of this team, it was on me to step up,\u201d Harden said after a shootaround practice months later after the Rockets had climbed out of their early season hole and back into the top four of the Western Conference playoff chase. \u201cSomebody had to do something and it was on me and whoever else we had available at the time to lock in and get us back in a groove.\u201d That groove, that cosmic vibe that was so evident with last year\u2019s team, was tougher to locate this time around. And even though they fell to the fourth spot in the standings on the final night of the regular season (a Paul George 3-point dagger in the Rockets\u2019 season finale a night earlier set the stage), the Rockets are fine with whatever grind is necessary to get a crack at redemption. \u201cWhen we do what we\u2019re supposed to do, when we handle our business the right way,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe can beat anybody.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have to do any preaching in his own locker room. \u201cFor sure, for sure, we operate with an elevated confidence where the Warriors or any other team is concerned,\u201d Tucker said, \u201cbecause our focus is always on what we do, what we control. Our confidence as a team has never wavered. We\u2019ve always been confident whether we\u2019re rolling at that moment or not, and I think that\u2019s honestly what has made us a great team.\u201d Great teams get there, they find their way to the biggest moments and cash in on opportunities to compete for the biggest prize. The Rockets know this, they\u2019ve done it. Championship teams, however, find a way to persevere through whatever obstacles get in the way. It\u2019s time to find out if these Rockets, once again the clearest and most dangerous threat to the Warriors, are still just a great team or something more. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Portland went 7-2 after losing Nurkic, scoring more than 117 points per 100 possessions over the nine games.

Shorter games? Silver ponders NBA format","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The future of NBA basketball could look like European soccer. Tournaments that take place during the season along with league games intrigue Commissioner Adam Silver as a way to change the format of the NBA\u2019s 82-game season. If it even keeps an 82-game season. Silver mentioned everything from shorter games to a shorter season Friday as ways the NBA could make its future product better for players and fans. \u201cThe format we have in place now \u2013 I\u2019m a traditionalist on one hand, but on the other hand it\u2019s 50 years old or so, presenting an 82-game season, and there\u2019s nothing magical about it,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI think it\u2019s on the league office to always be challenging the way we do things, to be paying attention to changing viewer habits, a changing marketplace, a new world of the way media is presented, often on smaller devices, less on screens, people having shorter attention spans, and saying, `This is an incredible game, it\u2019s never been more exciting, the athleticism has never been greater, fantastic players coming from all around the world, but what\u2019s the best way to put the season together?\u201d\u2018 Silver has focused on player health as commissioner, opening the regular season earlier to reduce the frequency of back-to-back games, and lengthening the All-Star break. But players are still sitting out games throughout the season \u2013 either by their choice or because their teams are requiring it \u2013 often for reasons being listed as load management. \u201cI think a fair point from fans could be if ultimately the science suggests that 82 games is too many games for these players, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have an 82-game season,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI accept that, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to look at.\u201d Fewer games could mean less revenue, unless they could be replaced by something that would generate as many or more viewers. Tournaments could be an answer, even if 82 games remains the format. Silver has pointed to European soccer as something that could bring new interest to the NBA by offering teams more opportunities to win something, instead of just having one champion. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m particularly interested in looking at different kinds of formats \u2014 at midseason tournaments, for example, play-in tournaments \u2014 because even accepting that players have so many miles on their bodies, there may be better ways to present it,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAssuming guys are going to play 82 games, maybe there should be a certain number of games in the regular season and then there should be two tournaments throughout the season.\u201d He acknowledged that model would require a change of thinking in American fans, who are used to only caring about the winner of the NBA Finals. Silver also mentioned the possibility of trimming games from 48 minutes to 40, which is the length of college and international games. He cautioned that none of the changes he discussed after the league\u2019s Board of Governors meetings were close to being implemented, and would continue to be studied within the league, perhaps for a few years. \u201cPart of it is just the formality that they need to be negotiated with the Players Association, but even if the Players Association came to us and said, \u2018You guys know best, what is it you want,\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t know how to answer it,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to require a lot more research, a lot more thoughtfulness on behalf of the teams, players and the league working together.\u201d"},{"id":34341,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-david-griffin-agree-principle-deal","date":"2019-04-12","title":"Reports: Pelicans hiring former Cavs GM Griffin","content":" NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The Pelicans have reached an agreement in principle to make former Cleveland Cavaliers general manager David Griffin New Orleans\u2019 new executive vice president of basketball operations, three people familiar with the situation said Friday. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because contract negotiations are ongoing and no announcement has been made. Griffin will take over for former Pelicans general manger Dell Demps, who was fired in the middle of his ninth season with the club \u2014 a few weeks after All-Star Anthony Davis\u2019 trade request in late January. Griffin\u2019s agreement to join New Orleans, which was first reported by ESPN , puts him at the center of the club\u2019s effort to find the best deal for Davis. Griffin also could decide the fate of Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who has two years left on his contract. The 45-year-old Griffin was the Cavaliers\u2019 GM from 2014 to 2017, during which LeBron James returned from Miami to Cleveland and the Cavs won an NBA title. The highlights of his tenure included a trade that brought star power forward Kevin Love to the Cavs. But Griffin\u2019s contract was not renewed after the 2016-17 season and James joined the Los Angele Lakers in free agency a year later. Griffin also worked in the Phoenix Suns\u2019 front office from 1993 until 2009, a stint that overlapped with Gentry\u2019s time as both a Suns assistant and head coach. Griffin was among six people interviewed by the Pelicans to replace Demps, including interim general manager Danny Ferry, Golden State assistant GM Larry Harris, Brooklyn Nets assistant GM Trajan Langon, Houston Rockets assistant GM Gersson Rosas and interim Washington president of basketball operations Tommy Sheppard. Now Griffin will attempt to transform a franchise that went 33-49 this season and has slightly better than a 25 percent chance of landing a top four pick in the NBA draft lottery on May 14. Trading Davis also could fetch a high draft choice, if Griffin chooses to go that route. Gentry has a regular-season record of 145-183 with one playoff appearance last season and one playoff series victory \u2014 a sweep of Portland before losing in five games to eventual champion Golden State. Although the Pelicans struggled this season, Gentry was commended by his players for his professionalism amid difficult circumstances. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of been the guy who has let us grow,\u201d said Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, who is coming off the best season of his 10-year NBA career. \u201cI know he has for sure let me grow. He\u2019s given me responsibility \u2026 and when he saw me succeed in it, he asked for more. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s coaches that you kind of feel like they\u2019re holding you back as a player and kind of restrict you, but I feel like he kind of just lets you go and figure it out yourself,\u201d Holiday said earlier this week. \u201cHe\u2019s always been like a partner instead of like a dictator, and I feel like for professionals like ourselves and the guys in the locker room, we really respect that.\u201d Davis, who averaged 25.9 points, 12 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 56 games, made his trade demand with 32 games left in the season and wound up missing 17 of those games, sometimes for rest and at other times was listed as out with back spasms, including for the final seven games. When he did play, it was rarely for much more than 20 minutes a game. The Pelicans will have a number of other pressing roster matters as well. Starting forward Julius Randle and starting point guard Elfrid Payton both will be free agents. Randle is coming off of the best season of his career \u2013 averaging 21.4 points and 8.7 rebounds. He credited the Pelicans with fostering his development and said he\u2019s open to coming back. Payton, who is from the New Orleans area, said playing in his hometown exceeded expectations and that he would like to be back. Payton missed much of the season with injuries, but also put together a historically significant string of five straight triple-doubles this spring."},{"id":34347,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thunder-paul-george-could-sit-game-1","date":"2019-04-12","title":"Thunder's George could sit Game 1 with ailing shoulder","content":" OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Thunder forward Paul George could miss Sunday\u2019s playoff opener at Portland with right shoulder soreness.

Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka announced Walton\u2019s departure Friday, three days after the abrupt resignation of president of basketball operations Magic Johnson. Pelinka called Walton leaving a mutual decision. The former Lakers forward went 98-148 after getting his first permanent head coaching job with the 16-time NBA champions. The former Golden State assistant never led the Lakers to the playoffs, not even after the arrival of LeBron James last summer. Walton leaves three days after the Lakers\u2019 final game of their 37-45 season was upstaged by the shocking pregame resignation of Johnson, who inherited Walton when he took over the Lakers\u2019 front office in February 2017. Johnson attributed his decision in part to his desire and reluctance to fire Walton, who is close to Lakers owner Jeanie Buss. A potential power struggle instead ended with both men out of their jobs after this wild week. Pelinka, who was hired along with Johnson, announced the move in a possible sign of the increased organizational power of Kobe Bryant\u2019s former agent. \u201cI want to thank Jeanie Buss and the Buss family for giving me the opportunity to coach the Lakers,\u201d Walton said in a statement issued by the Lakers. \u201cThis franchise and the city will always be special to me and my family.\u201d Walton joined the Lakers with fanfare in 2016 after his successful tenure alongside coach Steve Kerr with the powerhouse Warriors. Walton stepped in as Golden State\u2019s interim coach when Kerr was sidelined by health issues to start the 2015-16 season, and he led the Warriors to a 24-0 start and a 39-4 record before Kerr returned to the bench. The Lakers improved their record in each of Walton\u2019s three seasons, but never finished higher than third place in the Pacific Division. The current Lakers were the franchise\u2019s most successful team since their playoff drought began in 2013, but it wasn\u2019t enough to save Walton\u2019s job. \u201cI think Luke did a hell of a job with what he had, the cards he was dealt,\u201d point guard Rajon Rondo said. \u201cThe guys fought every night.\u201d Los Angeles was in fourth place in the Western Conference at 20-14 after beating Golden State last Christmas, but James and Rondo were injured during the game. The Lakers\u2019 season fell apart during the longest injury absence of James\u2019 career, and they ended the season with nearly every important player in their young core sidelined by injuries. Walton was tasked with one of the most difficult jobs in the NBA this season. Johnson and Pelinka gave him an oddly constructed roster of idiosyncratic NBA veterans on one-year deals playing alongside James and several talented youngsters including Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart. Walton\u2019s Lakers also were rattled by Johnson\u2019s midseason pursuit of disgruntled New Orleans forward Anthony Davis in a trade that would have resulted in a complete roster upheaval. Several Lakers acknowledged the shadowy pursuit\u2019s impact on their play. \u201cIt affected us a lot,\u201d guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope said. \u201cOnce the trade talk was there, the locker room changed. Everybody was pretty much worried about that, especially guys that haven\u2019t been through it. They were worried where they were going to end up.\u201d James and the Lakers\u2019 players have been uniformly supportive of Walton, who managed to keep his team playing hard and harmoniously under the Los Angeles microscope despite multiple major injuries and distractions. Walton just couldn\u2019t coax enough wins out of the Lakers, who ruined their second-half playoff hopes with confounding losses to bottom-dwellers New York and Phoenix. \u201cWant to thank Luke and the rest of the coaching staff for allowing me to be me from day 1,\u201d Kuzma tweeted. \u201cThey say opportunity is everything in the league and they gave me that right from the jump.\u201d Not many Lakers observers questioned Walton\u2019s man-management abilities, but his tactical acumen was widely criticized. Johnson and many fans had problems with everything from Walton\u2019s playing time decisions and curious rotations to his reported reluctance to add new assistants with fresh perspectives to his bench. Despite everything, the Lakers went 15-8 in their 23 games with James, Ingram and Ball all healthy. Buss decided not to find out whether Walton could continue that progress in the fall with renewed health and a high draft pick this summer. The Lakers\u2019 next coach will be their sixth since the retirement of Phil Jackson in 2011. Walton\u2019s 246 games in charge were the most by any coach in the tumultuous near-decade since the franchise\u2019s last championship in 2010. Ex-Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue, the former Lakers guard, already has been frequently mentioned as a potential replacement for Walton due to his obvious ties to James. Philadelphia assistant Monty Williams, the well-regarded former New Orleans head coach, also is expected to be a candidate."},{"id":34342,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kupchak-hornets-priority-keep-kemba-walker","date":"2019-04-12","title":"Kupchak: Hornets to do 'everything we can' to keep Walker","content":" CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Mitch Kupchak says the Charlotte Hornets plan to do everything they can to keep three-time All-Star Kemba Walker. The Hornets first-year general manager knows that has become a two-sided equation given Walker is set to become an unrestricted free agent in July and able to choose his next team. The 28-year-old Walker was an All-Star game starter this season and averaged a career-high 25.6 points per game, so he\u2019s expected to be hot commodity when the free agent market opens in July. \u201cI think this is a place that he wants to be and we\u2019ll do everything that we can to bring him back here,\u201d Kupchak said Friday. \u201cBut he is half of the equation.\u201d For Walker to stay, Kupchak may have to find productive quality pieces to put around him \u2013 and quickly. They\u2019ve struggled to do that in the past with players like Nicolas Batum \u2013 who received a five-year, $120 million contract three years ago \u2013 failing to live up to expectations. Walker has said in the past he wants to continue playing for the Hornets and \u201ccreate something special here\u201d because he loves living in Charlotte. But the 6-foot-1 point guard appeared to slightly back off those statements in recent days, saying repeatedly \u201cI want to win.\u201d Charlotte has failed to reach the playoffs the past three seasons. Walker, an NCAA national champion at UConn, has only been to the postseason twice in his eight NBA seasons and has never gotten out of the first round. Kupchak said he knows Walker is frustrated by losing. He wants to put more talent around his star player that would make the Hornets a consistent playoff contender, but also knows that won\u2019t be easy. The Hornets don\u2019t have the money to sign a difference maker in free agency, so Kupchak said the best option is to acquire talent through a trade. Jeremy Lamb, the team\u2019s second-leading scorer, is an unrestricted free agent while backup center Frank Kaminsky is a restricted free agent. Kupchak said the Hornets \u201cfinancially are not as flexible as I would like us to be, so there could be some challenges going forward with our free agents.\u201d Whether anything Kupchak does is enough to convince Walker to re-sign with Charlotte remains to be seen. But in the meantime Kupchak went out of his way to make sure Walker knows he\u2019s appreciated \u2013 and wanted \u2013 by the Hornets. \u201cThere has not been a player with this franchise like Kemba Walker,\u201d Kupchack said of the Hornets\u2019 all-time leading scorer. \u201cHe is a once in a generation kind of a player and he is fun to watch. He is competitive, he is a good teammate,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cThose are all qualities that I like to see and I know that people in the organization and our fans like to see in players.\u201d"},{"id":34367,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-preview-nuggets-spurs","date":"2019-04-12","title":"Numbers preview: Denver Nuggets (2) vs. San Antonio Spurs (7)","content":" The Denver Nuggets responded to their last-night-of-the-season elimination last season by finishing with the second best record in the Western Conference.

And their first-round opponent \u2014 the San Antonio Spurs \u2014 has a coach who has been on the bench for 66,981 minutes of playoff basketball over the last 22 years. The Nuggets, of course, have home-court advantage. And these are two teams that have played much better at home than they have on the road.

It was edgier to do so last summer, before newly hired Mike Budenholzer had run his first practice or won his first game as the 16th full-time coach in team history. Yet that\u2019s what a couple of Bucks bloggers did, anticipating with uncanny accuracy the sort of impact Budenholzer and his staff would have as replacements for the intriguing-but-unsatisfying Jason Kidd crew that preceded them. First, as news broke of Budenholzer\u2019s arrival in Milwaukee, Jordan Treske of the Behind The Buck Pass Web site peered into a pebble-grained crystal ball. \u2026 Now the prospects of a Budenholzer-led Bucks team could very well satisfy the hopes and dreams every fan has had after following along the last four years of the team\u2019s former coaching regime. Whether it\u2019s based off of his days as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs or his five-year reign with the [Atlanta] Hawks, Budenholzer has both been witness to and led the charge in building and establishing an identity and culture along his stops on the NBA level. Two months later, after the Bucks\u2019 stint in Las Vegas for summer league action, it was Mitchell Maurer living in the prescient for BrewHoop.com . Fans are confident that the Bucks will be better this season, but it cannot be overstated how much better they will be under Budenholzer. They are going to actually shoot more threes, play faster on offense, and play smarter on defense. The talent on the roster \u2013 which is considerable, don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise \u2013 is finally in a position where their collective talents won\u2019t be ignored, but leveraged. We might even see a scheme that fits the players, rather than players being shoved into a scheme. Last season, the goal was to win 50 games, and the Bucks fell short. This season, the goal might remain the same, but the league might be shocked at how well the Milwaukee Bucks meet\u2026and possibly exceed that goal The season played out pretty much as the scribes imagined it, quite likely beyond Budenholzer\u2019s or his bosses\u2019 wildest dreams. Milwaukee (60-22) finished with the NBA\u2019s best record, locking down homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. The Bucks led the league in points per game (118.1), were first in defensive rating (104.9) and net rating (8.6), and were fourth in offensive rating (113.5). Their improvement on both ends also showed in their No. 1 spot in defensive field goal percentage (.433) and in the franchise-record 1,105 3-point field goals they made \u2014 more than any team in history other than the Houston Rockets the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo did more than give the Bucks coach his first superstar \u2014 he blossomed fully into a co-favorite with Houston Rockets guard James Harden for the Kia MVP award . The timing of it all was impeccable, with Milwaukee selling out their new arena, Fiserv Forum, 36 times in 41 dates. They\u2019ll do it again Sunday when they face the Detroit Pistons in Game 1 ( 7 ET, TNT ), in what team and fans alike hope will be a postseason run that extends into June. Antetokounmpo, with his gaudy stats and effervescent personality, is in all fairness the person most responsible for this Bucks season, a throwback in achievement all the way to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s Milwaukee era . Take him off this squad \u2014 one of the hypothetical measures of MVP worthiness \u2014 and we\u2019re looking at a borderline No. 8 seed- slash -lottery team. Still, one player\u2019s progression \u2014 even in a massive Gyro Step, courtesy of \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t enough to explain all the ways in which the Bucks have changed. Budenholzer impacted the Bucks\u2019 other players, too. Take them away and Antetokounmpo might as well be Bradley Beal, Devin Booker or Karl-Anthony Towns, toiling in lottery land. Considering Milwaukee\u2019s modest summer additions (Brook Lopez, Ersan Ilyasova, Pat Connaughton, rookie Donte DiVincenzo), hiring Budenholzer might be the move that has Bucks GM Jon Horst on the short list for NBA Executive of the Year. The coach\u2019s embrace and deployment of newcomers (such as George Hill and Nikola Mirotic) and development of deep-rotation players (like Sterling Brown and D.J. Wilson) are further evidence of his value. There\u2019s no denying the contributions of Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates, notably: *  Khris Middleton joined Giannis as a 2019 All-Star , with the recognition coming not just late (his seventh season) but in a year when Middleton actually has been doing less. He\u2019s scoring fewer points, taking fewer shots and logging fewer minutes than last season , but shifting a couple steps back for more 3-point attempts and fewer mid-range shots has helped Antetokounmpo and opened up the offense. Also, Middleton has bumped up his scoring, accuracy, rebounds and assists since All-Star weekend. *  Point guard Eric Bledsoe, inconsistent in his first Bucks season and a disappointment in the 2018 playoffs, has been the point of their defensive spear. Abandoning Kidd\u2019s trapping, scrambling defensive scheme has helped Bledsoe lock in on rival guards, and he\u2019s been reliable enough to merit the four-year, $70 million extension he recently signed , sparking himself and the team one more free agent in this summer\u2019s market. *  The 7-foot, 270-pound Lopez has fully unleashed the 3-point prowess he began demonstrating just two seasons ago in Brooklyn. This season he became the first player to amass at least 150 3-point field goals and 150 blocked shots, and he set an NBA record for 3-pointers (187) by a 7-footer. He has earned the nickname \u201cSplash Mountain,\u201d while defending the rim and pre-empting more shots as a threat than he actually blocks. *  Malcolm Brogdon, 2017\u2019s Kia Rookie of the Year, was overachieving again before he went out in March with plantar fasciitis in his right foot . Brogdon routinely showed the confidence and creativity to hit from the arc or drive to the rim, particularly at times when the offense otherwise bogged down. He also became just the eighth player in NBA history to average at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3-point range and 90 percent from the foul line. Then again, the way the Bucks\u2019 reserves have stepped up, the injuries or occasional slumps have been papered over well off the bench. Mirotic had made only 31 3-pointers in 14 games before going out with a fractured left thumb , but Ilyasova and others filled the void. Ditto Hill for Brogdon, Brown and Connaughton for Tony Snell and so on. Budenholzer has facilitated the patchwork by coaching to his players\u2019 strengths, minimizing their weaknesses and getting them \u2014 through individual work, relationship skills and more \u2014 to take ownership of what they\u2019re building in Milwaukee.  Budenholzer\u2019s credentials all stem from his ability to help players thrive, from his 17 years at Gregg Popovich\u2019s side in San Antonio to the success he had ( 2015 Coach of the Year ) in all but the last of his five seasons in Atlanta. He has transformed Milwaukee\u2019s offense into a 3-point nightmare for opponents. The big circles around the perimeter he had emblazoned on the practice court in training camp was a visual aid and early indicator of how the Bucks would play; before long, players could pass the ball blindly to those spots, confident a teammate would be there. Last season, the Bucks ranked 25th in 3-point attempt rate, taking only 29.7 percent of their shots from outside the arc. This season, they\u2019re third at 41.9 percent. Meanwhile, the Bucks have cleaned up their defense and their rebounding. They averaged 21.4 fouls and sent opponents to the line for 23.5 free throws per game in 2017-18. This season, both went down to 19.6 and 20.7, respectively. Their defensive rebounding percentage soared from No. 29 last year (75.9) to No. 1 (80.3). Other numbers demonstrate how differently Milwaukee is playing and how much they\u2019re enjoying it. They were 27-12 against teams above .500. They didn\u2019t lose two games in a row until March. The Bucks were 45-5 in games decided by 10 points or more. Of the seven other teams in NBA history to win at least 45 games by double-digit margins, each one capped that season by snagging the NBA title. Now, with LeBron James out of the East, a schedule of demonstrated excellence behind them and a trust \u2014 players to coaches, coaches to players \u2014 that appears to be unshakeable, the Bucks have narrowed their targeted numbers down essentially to one: Sixteen, as in four times four, as in the total victories needed to capture the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy. Budenholzer, Antetokounmpo and the rest would love to keep it all that simple. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the grand total of the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 pre-playoff sample size they had to work with in evaluating the strengths and weakness of their revamped, all-in roster that enters this postseason with championship-level expectations. Ten games. Eight wins and two losses, both to the hated Boston Celtics, is all we have to go on for a team that will dive into a first-round series with the Brooklyn Nets with an internal Finals-or-bust edict, due to the quick-change potion sprinkled on the roster when they traded for both Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in a three-month stretch that accelerated the game plan dramatically. These playoffs loom larger in Philadelphia than perhaps anywhere else in the Eastern Conference because the Sixers are on the clock now with Butler, Harris and J.J. Redick headed for free agency this summer. Stumble in this postseason and \u201cThe Process\u201d doesn\u2019t look so shiny anymore, even with All-Stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons locked in for the foreseeable future. \u201cThe [playoff environment] is a stark difference. The intensity ratchets up, the physicality is different,\u201d Sixers general manager Elton Brand told reporters earlier this week. \u201cStar players win in the playoffs. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re built for.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt the Sixers have the most top-heavy starting five of any team in the Eastern Conference playoff field; the Golden State Warriors being the only team in the league capable of producing a more formidable first five. But no one is exactly sure if Embiid is even physically ready for Game 1 against the Nets. Brand and Sixers coach Brett Brown have given mixed signals as to whether the self-proclaimed \u201cmost unstoppable\u201d player in the league is going to be there at opening tip of the most important postseason in recent franchise history. (Embiid manhandled the Nets during their four regular-season matchups, by the way, averaging 30.0 points on 60 percent shooting to go with 14.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists.) The Sixers went 8-10 without Embiid in the lineup this season and the uncertainty of his status is just one more reason fans in Philadelphia are right to be cautiously optimistic heading into this first-round series. And yet, a healthy Embiid is also the reason for all the optimism from Brand, who knows that having the most dominant physical presence in the entire league can be the difference between an early postseason exit and a potential run to The Finals. \u201cI\u2019m confident in this group,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to show up well when those bright lights come on.\u201d With Embiid on the floor, the Sixers are an elite defensive outfit, a group capable of beating any team with that stacked starting unit\u2019s combination of length, versatility, skill and superstar power. But he missed 14 of the Sixers\u2019 final 24 games after All-Star Weekend with \u201cload management.\u201d \u201cNone of us should expect anything greater than a B,\u201d Brown said, assigning a letter grade to what should be expected from Embiid physically, given all of the actual game time missed. \u201cWhile I think he\u2019s doing some good work behind the scenes, there\u2019s nothing like playing basketball to get in shape to play basketball. And I think that over the course of a series we have to make sure that he\u2019s able to sustain that. To go out and play one game and then go away for a few days is a lot easier than backing stuff up. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll learn a lot.\u201d Which brings us back to those 10 games, and perhaps more importantly those eight wins in those 10 games that Embiid, Simmons, Butler, Harris and Redick played in together. Five of those wins came against playoff teams (Denver, Indiana, Milwaukee, Boston and Brooklyn) and a sixth was against a LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers bunch that was still in the Western Conference playoff chase at the time. That snapshot of what these guys are capable of might help explain Brand\u2019s confidence. And since he\u2019s been in charge of the altered vision for this team, he has every right to stoke that fire heading into this most critical of postseasons. That same 10 games, however, and the limited nature of that sample size, is the reason Brown is a bit more measured in his understanding of what it all means for the Sixers\u2019 ultimate bottom line. \u201cThe 10 games that we have played together as stars,\u201d Brown said, \u201cI wished it was significantly more. And so to say, \u2018we\u2019re all prepared, we\u2019re ready to go.\u2019 That shouldn\u2019t [be said] and isn\u2019t true. I\u2019m not crying about that. The good news is we have talent. And so we\u2019re hoping to jump into the playoffs, find the wave and ride the current and continue to play good basketball. \u201cBut to suggest we\u2019ve had a season\u2019s worth of preparation is really just factually wrong, in fact just grossly wrong as we can hear by the numbers. And so we will take what we have and I\u2019m excited to take what we have and the mystery kind of remains \u2026 we really haven\u2019t played a ton of basketball together.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

It\u2019s a skill that is short-lived save for the all-time great players and franchises, and even those shelf lives have an expiration date. NBA history is littered with teams that seemed poised to seize the crown, only to fall short and realize too late they had already peaked. Free agency, the salary cap, and downright bad luck ends championship runs before they take off. As many as six teams \u2013 and maybe more \u2014 this postseason could face that future. In this space, we\u2019re addressing franchises boasting some combination of expectations, fruitless longevity and enormous potential for offseason change. Here are the teams that face look-in-the-mirror moments should their playoff runs end in the first two rounds \u2026 * * * Less than one year ago, the Celtics possessed the most enviable position in the league: a war chest of young talent, potentially high lottery picks, two returning healthy All-Stars and an experience-building run to the Eastern Conference finals. Today the Celtics\u2019 blindingly bright future is somewhat obscured. Kyrie Irving has hedged on his preseason commitment to remain in Boston. Gordon Hayward is just now showing some consistent play after his leg injury last season. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have, if anything, regressed after stepping up in 2017-18. Persistent rumors say Boston would love to team disgruntled superstar Anthony Davis with Irving. But would Irving stay if the Celtics miss the East finals? If he does, is some combination of less valuable picks (the Sacramento Kings were far better than Boston anticipated this season) and Brown\/Tatum enough to land Davis? If Irving does leave, would Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge be comfortable with a more youth-centric era that might need more seasoning before reaching another conference finals?  The Rockets may have suffered the most from Wednesday\u2019s late-night musical chairs of playoff seeding. Houston drew a peaking defensive juggernaut (the No. 5-seeded Utah Jazz) instead of an undermanned No. 3 seed (Portland Trail Blazers) or an untested playoff squad (the No. 2-seeded Denver Nuggets). Advance, and the Rockets will likely meet the two-time defending-champion Golden State Warriors in the West semifinals. Would such sour luck be enough of an excuse to convince Houston to simply run it back next season? James Harden isn\u2019t going anywhere, but Chris Paul has missed more than 20 games each of the last three seasons \u2014 and is also owed nearly $125 million over the next three. PJ Tucker, arguably the Rockets\u2019 second-most indispensable player, turns 34 next month. Eric Gordon will be in the final year of his deal next season. With Clint Capela their only likely source of youthful improvement, will the Rockets feel compelled to shake things up after five 50-win, Harden-led seasons? After all the (deserved) Paul George Kia MVP buzz, the Thunder finished with one more win than last season . As statistically overwhelming as Russell Westbrook is, Oklahoma City has yet to crack 50 wins since Kevin Durant moved on. That is not on Westbrook or George, the only two offensive weapons Portland should fear in the first round. The Thunder have seemingly always lacked at least one member of a truly threatening crunch-time five this decade. Yet with their payroll already above the tax line for 2019-20, the opportunity to improve is limited. Thunder GM Sam Presti will try. Dennis Schroder was an imperfect-yet-still-preferable gamble to keeping a fast-fading Carmelo Anthony. Patrick Patterson and Markieff Morris seemed like perfect fits up front \u2026 until they stepped on the court. Will the Thunder continue their economic tinkering if they fall short again? The brackets broke better for OKC than any other team, pitting it against a depleted Blazers squad in the first round and either a green Denver or a grey San Antonio in the West semis. If the Thunder lose to the Blazers, though, would they be content giving it another run next season? It seems absurd for a recently baptized playoff team to face a crossroads. Yet the 76ers paved that path themselves with in-season trades for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris . Their starting five is the most talented outside of Oakland, and talent usually wins in the playoffs. Still, Philadelphia finished the season 17-11 after acquiring Harris \u2013 and he and Butler are unrestricted free agents this summer. Sixers general manager Elton Brand has said he intends to keep that pair alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Yet for all their talent, the 76ers may very well be underdogs should they face the Toronto Raptors in the East semis. There should be no shame in losing in that round, but any window that includes max contracts for Embiid, Harris and Butler would be tight indeed. Would Philadelphia spend more judiciously if this squad prematurely bows out after going all in? Damian Lilllard has quietly become a rare breed \u2014 an All-NBA talent doubling as a universally admired franchise icon. Yet for all his individual accomplishments, Lillard has won just two playoff series in five years. That\u2019s not Lillard\u2019s fault, as it certainly was not his idea to commit a combined $226 million to Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Mo Harkless and Meyers Leonard in 2016. Yet the Blazers have overcome that limiting offseason with a 53-win season behind Lillard, CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic. Portland is not the first team to see optimism cut short by rotten luck. With Nurkic out and McCollum only just returning from injury , the Blazers could lose to the Thunder in the first round. Would the Blazers be tempted to break up their high-scoring backcourt after a third consecutive first-round exit? Would a West semis run be enough to forestall that decision? Many of those \u201816 signees see their contracts expire in \u201820. Would Portland be willing to give the Lilllard-McCollum duo one more run until then? Hovering over the Raptors\u2019 quietly impressive season is that their star player could be the most talented one-year mercenary in NBA history. Toronto knew Kawhi Leonard could bolt this summer, yet GM Masai Ujiri didn\u2019t care. That attitude mirrors Oklahoma City\u2019s similar gamble with George in \u201817. Yet unlike the Thunder, the Raptors do not have an established All-NBA superstar to fall back if Leonard leaves. Leonard\u2019s decision to leave becomes more interesting the deeper the Raptors advance. Would he leave a team that falls in a hard-fought conference finals series or even The Finals? He has given zero indication one way or the other. If Leonard does depart, the Raptors will be forced to play keep-or-sell on several rotation players. Marc Gasol could accept his $25 million player option for next season. Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry and Fred Van Vleet comprise an additional $66 million in expiring money in \u201819-20. Danny Green is an unrestricted free agent this summer. Without Leonard, do the Raptors immediately pivot around rising star Pascal Siakam? If so, how many of the veterans do they keep around him? For those that must go, will Toronto try to convert their expiring deals into younger\/future assets? Or will Kawhi lead Toronto to The Finals, decide to stay, and make all of this moot?"},{"id":34408,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-preview-warriors-clippers","date":"2019-04-12","title":"Numbers preview: Golden State Warriors (1) vs. LA Clippers (8)","content":" Is this the last run for this version (the one with Kevin Durant) of the Golden State Warriors?

The product of \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d and his brilliant consistency was a league-best 60-win season that delivered the No. 1 overall seed in the playoffs to the Bucks. Whether that is enough to deliver Antetokounmpo his first Kia MVP remains to be seen. But it was enough to secure the No. 1 spot on the final Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of this season. Antetokounmpo edged out reigning Kia MVP James Harden in an epic duel and photo-finish, on the strength of Antetokounmpo\u2019s versatility and dominance on both ends of the floor for what turned out to be the NBA\u2019s best team. But make no mistake, Harden\u2019s case for the top spot is every bit as compelling as Antetokounmpo\u2019s. Harden\u2019s encore season was nothing short of epic, a scoring spectacular that forced his name into conversations and statistical categories populated by the likes of Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. *  His nine 50-point games were the most in the league since Kobe Bryant\u2019s 10 in the \u201806-07 season . *  His 32 consecutive games of scoring 30 or more points is the second-longest streak of all time to Wilt Chamberlain, who dropped 30 or more 65 straight times in \u201961-62. (The Rockets went 21-11 during Harden\u2019s 30-point tear as it helped resuscitate their season during an injury-riddled stretch.) *  Harden also became the first player in NBA history to score 30 or more points against all 29 other teams in the same season, the first player to accomplish that feat since Jordan scored 30 or more against all 22 other teams in \u201986-87. Bird also did likewise in his \u201984-85 MVP season, making them the only players to accomplish that feat since the NBA-ABA merger. In his bid to become the 12th player in NBA history to win back-to-back MVPs , Harden operated with a usage rating (39.3%) that ranks second all-time to Russell Westbrook\u2019s (40.0%) during his Kia MVP season (2016-17) . So how, you might ask, did Antetokounmpo rise to the top of my ballot considering all Harden accomplished? A more traditional argument \u2014 the undisputed best player having a transcendent season for the league\u2019s best team \u2014 is what fueled Antetokounmpo\u2019s campaign. Sure, there\u2019s a historical context for what he did this season as well. Even though he\u2019s far from a traditional, dominant low-post big man, Antetokounmpo controls games in the manner that Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did during MVP-winning seasons during their Hall of Fame careers. (O\u2019Neal said so himself this season .) Compare Antetokounmpo\u2019s raw numbers this season (27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 blocks and 1.3 steals per game) to Olajuwon\u2019s during his \u201893-94 MVP season (27.3 ppg, 11.9 rpg, 3.6 apg, 3.7 bpg and 1.6 spg) or O\u2019Neal\u2019s \u201999-00 MVP season (29.7 ppg, 13.6 rpg, 3.8 apg, 3 bpg and 0.5 spg) or Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s \u201875-76 MVP season (27.7 ppg, 16.9 rpg, 5 apg, 4.1 bpg and 1.5 spg) for some context on just how historically dominant he has been. Antetokounmpo could conceivably win MVP, Kia Defensive Player of the Year and Kia Most Improved Player awards all in the same season. That\u2019s how good and impactful his performance has been for a Bucks teams that reached new heights under first-year coach Mike Budenholzer. The fact that he\u2019s doing this \u2013 being a top three scorer behind Harden and Paul George, without the aid of anything close to a competent 3-point shot in a the 3-point era \u2014 makes it even more remarkable. The most frightening part of the rest of the league? That he\u2019s already reached this level at 24, with a decade or more of continued improvement and sustained dominance surely ahead. Consistent brilliance, it\u2019s what delivered the Bucks to the top of the standings and Antetokounmpo to the top of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder this season. It\u2019s also what will keep them both in that mix for years to come. * * * The top five in the final edition of the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stat s :  27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.3 blocks In a season filled with drama and turmoil elsewhere, Antetokounmpo starred in the season\u2019s best feel-good story as he and the Bucks ascended to the top of the NBA in Budenholzer\u2019s first season at the helm. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d and his rise prompted the Bucks\u2019 front office to go all-in on the season, making moves to push forward in an Eastern Conference playoff chase lacking LeBron James for the first time in nearly a decade. Antetokounmpo\u2019s magical all-around work puts him in a category that barely a handful of players in the league can even come close to be included in. Folks in Milwaukee haven\u2019t seen a player of this caliber in the hometown team\u2019s inform since Abdul-Jabbar was collecting MVP hardware and winning a championship along side Oscar Robertson. No offense to Khris Middleton, himself an All-Star this season, but Antetokounmpo doesn\u2019t have the luxury of playing alongside another player of his caliber the way fellow top-five MVP candidates James Harden, Paul George and Stephen Curry do each night. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  36.1 points, 7.5 assists, 6.5 rebounds, 2.1 steals After a rough start to to the season, Harden has led the Rockets on a tear through the West standings and his own personal assault on the NBA\u2019s scoring records. The reigning Kia MVP finished his second straight season with a scoring average north of 30 points ( his 36.1 ppg is the highest in the league since Bryant\u2019s 35.4 ppg in \u201905-06 ). Harden has piled up point-rebound-assist numbers this season that no player in league history ever has. The historical nature of the season he crafted has been as impressive as it was unprecedented. And the criticisms of his defensive work, long the area of his game most poked at, isn\u2019t the weakness it\u2019s been in the past. Harden won\u2019t show up on any Kia DPOY ballots, but he\u2019s vastly improved that part of his game. Were it not for Antetokounmpo\u2019s season for the ages, Harden would sit atop this list once again. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.0 points 8.2 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 2.2 steals George turned in his finest NBA season after a career-altering free-agent decision to stick with the Thunder last summer instead of looking elsewhere (namely Los Angeles). If he needed validation for his choice, George can just run down the list of accomplishments he piled up this season. He finished second in the scoring chase to Harden, led the league in steals , earned a starting nod in the All-Star Game and will likely finish in the top three of the voting for Kia DPOY. He did all of this sharing the load with Russell Westbrook, who averaged a triple-double for the third straight season . Were it not for a nagging shoulder injury that slowed he and the Thunder down late in the season, George might have challenged Harden and Antetokounmpo for one of the top two spots here. But his season-long roll has cemented him as one of the top two-way players in the league. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  27.3 points, 5.3 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.3 steals Curry actually saw an uptick in his scoring this season . And although though he didn\u2019t perform at the 50-40-90 shooting level he did during his last Kia MVP season , he\u2019s still tooling around in that neighborhood. The fact that he\u2019s capable of doing that and leading the two-time reigning NBA champions in scoring while a scoring machine like Kevin Durant is on the roster tells you just how potent Curry\u2019s game has become. Curry has persevered through all of the drama that accompanied this season in Oakland ( from the Durant-Draymond dust-up early on to the integration of DeMarcus Cousins into the mix), serving as the calming influence during a campaign that proved to be every bit as tough as Warriors coach Steve Ker warned it would be. There\u2019s a reason you rarely see the same group push through the league the way the Warriors have the past five seasons. It takes special, transcendent talents to lead that sort of charge. It takes a player like Curry, who no matter what happens this summer, will remain that figure for the Warriors. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  20.1 points, 10.8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.4steals Jokic has improved so much and so rapidly over the course of his four NBA seasons that he\u2019s shocked its ecosystem. Anyone outside of the Nuggets who claims to have seen this type of season coming from \u201cThe Joker\u201d is peddling fake news. Jokic has been a revelation the past two seasons, cashing in on the opportunities his undeniable talent created for him during some transition seasons in Denver. He\u2019s as gifted and skilled a passer as there is in the league right now, regardless of position. He\u2019s a nightly triple-double threat and is improving as a defender (which is perhaps his lone, glaring weakness). It\u2019s rare for a big man in today\u2019s NBA to facilitate for his team the way Jokic does. But kudos to Nuggets coach Mike Malone for constructing an attack that played to strengths of his best and most versatile player. It turned out that what worked best for Jokic is what worked best for the Nuggets, who climbed their way to No. 2 in the West after missing out on the playoffs a year ago on the final night of the regular season. Jokic is a good bet for a first-team All-NBA nod to top it all off. * * * 6. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 8.  Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 9.

Last summer, they traded the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer (DeMar DeRozan) for Kawhi Leonard, knowing that Leonard could leave after a year. And at the trade deadline, they traded another franchise cornerstone (Jonas Valanciunas) for Marc Gasol. With their \u201cload management\u201d program, the Raptors did their best to keep Leonard fresh all season. And they managed to finish with the league\u2019s second best record despite 22 missed games from Leonard and 17 missed games from Kyle Lowry.

The Warriors clinched the best record in the Western Conference, which means the road to the NBA Finals will be the 880 Freeway, which during weekday rush finally gets unclogged right around halftime at Oracle Arena. Home court is secured. Steph Curry\u2019s shooting percentages from the floor and 3-point range and free-throw line are 47, 44 and 91. Yep, like a chimney, still smoking. Kevin Durant for the 11th straight year is averaging north of 25 points and for the second time in three years is testy about folks crystal-balling his future plans as a pending free agent. OK, fine. Draymond Green has 16 technical fouls, tied for the league lead. All good here. Klay Thompson is smooth with the shooting stroke \u2014 21 points a game despite a rough start \u2014 and remains mellow in all other facets of life. Chill. DeMarcus Cousins, 14 months removed from a torn Achilles, is upright instead of horizontal. Let\u2019s Boogie. In all, the Warriors are healthy first and foremost, feeling frisky for the most part, and completely restless after being bored out of their minds for seven months. Somehow, they made it through (as you knew they would) and now here they are, ready to make it three straight championships and four in five years. Is there anything or anyone capable of standing in their way? Come to think of it, yes: The Warriors themselves. If the Warriors are unable to pop corks in June or burst the bubble of opposing teams with big dreams, it\u2019ll probably be because somehow, the Warriors screwed up. They\u2019ll either underestimate someone (most likely the surging Rockets) or overreact to questionable officiating calls or \u2026 or \u2026 well, that\u2019s about it. Anything beyond that or a major injury just seems improbable at this point. Once again, the Warriors are that good, that far beyond the field. Yes, there is the chance another team might catch fire and pull a surprise or two, which means the Warriors are fortunate this isn\u2019t the NCAA Tournament. This is Big Boy Playoff Basketball, a seven-game series, where the best team usually wins. You must beat the Warriors four times. Again, there are often circumstances that tweak that theory, such as 2016 when Green served a one-game suspension and Andrew Bogut suffered an unfortunate injury and the Warriors lost the championship series in seven to the Cavaliers. Otherwise \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ve put in some new sets that we feel good about,\u201d said Durant. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to get started and see where this takes us.\u201d The Warriors once again are flexing the rare combination of fundamentals and flash, a team that can play any styles, and one that doesn\u2019t bring an apparent weakness that will give coach Steve Kerr reason for pause. Curry and Durant took turns being in the conversation for MVP at times this season and although neither is James Harden or Giannis Antetokoumnpo, neither seem to care much about it, either. That shows their growth and where their priorities lie. The two resident superstars know the Gods paired them together for one reason, and so far after two years and counting, neither player has failed to deliver on that reason. The last team to win three straight titles was the Kobe Bryant-Shaquille O\u2019Neal Lakers almost two decades ago. There was always a simmering of tension between Kobe and Shaq as that dynasty wore on, and it eventually contributed to their breakup. Not so with Curry and Durant; if KD leaves this summer, it won\u2019t be because of an ego clash with his very accommodating co-star. The sixth regular season under Kerr was not without a few paper cuts. The Warriors were, for some reason, far too quick-tempered regarding the referees. Borderline calls that didn\u2019t go their way were met with smirks, confrontations and behavior unfitting for champions who shouldn\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Durant has been particularly petty; his 16 technicals not only ties notorious hot-head Draymond for the league lead, but it\u2019s by far the most he\u2019s collected in a single season. Is it because the free-agent chatter is getting to Durant? Theories abound. Also, the bench lacks the same pop it had in years past. Golden State has a lethal starting five but the \u201cStrength In Numbers\u201d motto might not apply this time. Shaun Livingston is older and on the verge of calling it quits and the young talent being groomed hasn\u2019t, for the most part, distinguished itself. The addition of old friend Andrew Bogut should help; Bogut returned to the Warriors in tremendous shape and as usual with a quick-trigger wit that goes over well in the locker room. Yet this team overall still wears the look of a Goliath. There\u2019s five All-Stars on the floor at tipoff and a pair of MVPs. No other team can match that, and to continue the discussion, Kerr has shown an ability to push most if not all the right buttons this time of year. Mostly, the signs of motivation, which waned as expected over the last six months, are sure to surface again, given the stakes. Most of the Warriors\u2019 core have the opportunity to one day walk away from this game with at least three championships and that could give those players \u2014 a role player such as Green, for instance \u2014 credibility for entry into the Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cWhen you get to this point,\u201d said Curry, \u201cthere is temptation to enjoy the moment, and we do have appreciation for what we\u2019ve done, but theres also more to do.\u201d Their path to June doesn\u2019t appear any more treacherous than before. There\u2019s no superteam standing in their way, no prime LeBron James \u2014 or LeBron, period. Those teams bringing 50-plus wins this season to the dance are certainly capable of Golden State\u2019s respect, yet lacking in championship pedigree: Milwaukee, Toronto, Denver, Philly. They have not Been There and Done That. There\u2019s only one team that in the past gave the Warriors the shivers, and that\u2019s Houston. If the seedings hold firm, the Warriors will see the Rockets the second round, which is in the Warriors\u2019 favor because they\u2019ll be fresh. And Chris Paul\u2019s body clock alarm might be ready to go off again. Plus, this year the Warriors are bringing Cousins along for the ride and there might be a few games along the way where he takes the wheel or at least rides shotgun. Clumsy and wheezing two months ago from all the rehab, Cousins seems more assured of his body and his reclaimed game. He also knows he\u2019ll be given as many chances as possible to (a) help the Warriors win a title, and (b) make some money for himself. Actually, those two go hand-in-hand. Of course, there\u2019s the matter of the elephant in the room, which is: This Might Be It for the dynasty. Yes, Cousins is certainly walking out that door in July to cash in because he can\u2019t do so with the Warriors due to quirky salary cap rules. And then there\u2019s Durant, who has refused to commit verbally or otherwise to the Warriors because evidently there\u2019s something else out there that interests him. As for Thompson, who has verbally committed to the Warriors, there\u2019s still a matter of money and what it will take to keep the brothers splashing. But that\u2019s a story for another day, say, July 1, when the Warriors\u2019 house of Lawrence O\u2019Brien trophies could come crashing down. They\u2019ll worry about that then. In the meantime, it\u2019s mid-April and the start of yet another awakening in Oakland. The Warriors are rising from their regular-season nap and finishing their final yawns and readying for the hunt. As we\u2019ve seen from this team before, playing the regular season is tiring. Playing for the championship is reinvigorating. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

After a 12-5 start, Memphis plummeted and finished 33-49, tied with New Orleans and Dallas. Wallace had said earlier that Bickerstaff would be returning after doing a \u201cterrific job.\u201d But Pera didn\u2019t agree and restructured the front office a few hours later. \u201cIn order to put our team on the path to sustainable success, it was necessary to change our approach to basketball operations,\u201d Pera said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to a re-energized front office and fresh approach to Memphis Grizzlies basketball under new leadership, while retaining the identity and values that have distinguished our team.\u201d Bickerstaff was named interim coach in November 2017 after the Grizzlies fired David Fizdale . He was given the job without the interim title last May. Now Memphis is looking for a fourth head coach since choosing not to renew Lionel Hollins\u2019 contract after he led the Grizzlies to their lone Western Conference final appearance in 2013. The Grizzlies also announced that Jason Wexler will be president of the Grizzlies overseeing both basketball and business operations, and Zachary Z. Kleiman replaces John Hollinger as executive vice president of basketball operations with Hollinger moving to an advisory role. The Grizzlies are keeping former player Tayshaun Prince as a special adviser. Memphis began this season with Wallace predicting the Grizzlies would be a playoff team. The Grizzlies wound up trading away center Marc Gasol at the trade deadline. With other trades and injuries that left nine rotation players benched with injuries for Wednesday night\u2019s season finale in a 132-117 win over Golden State, Memphis tied its own NBA record for most players used in one season \u2013 set last season \u2013 again at 28. Memphis also set the NBA mark with 20 different leading scorers, topping the old record of 16 set by the Knicks in 2014-15. While Memphis kept veteran point guard Mike Conley after a frenzy of speculation about his future before the trade deadline, that chatter is about to start again. And Conley, 31, sounds ready to consider his best interest about what happens next with Memphis in full-blown rebuilding mode. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think that would be the ideal situation,\u201d Conley said. \u201cIdeally, I don\u2019t think anybody in my situation would want to go through that again, (since) I don\u2019t know how many years I have left.\u201d Conley helped his potential value by averaging 24 points and 6.5 assists over his final 16 games. Conley still has two seasons left on the max deal he signed in July 2016,. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much getting ready for it, getting ready for that storm \u2026,\u201d Conley said of the coming speculation. \u201cIn the last few weeks, it\u2019s become more and more like knocking on the door. It\u2019s right around the corner. This stuff is going to fire up again. Rumors, all that stuff is going to pop up.\u201d Wallace oversaw the signing of Chandler Parsons to a four-year, $94 million deal that has seen the forward play 95 games combined over the first three seasons. The Grizzlies spent much of the season trying to finish outside the top eight spots in the draft to finally pay off a 2015 midseason trade for Jeff Green that still requires a first-round pick to be sent to Boston. The selection is protected if Memphis finished anywhere from No. 1 to 8 in the draft, and the Grizzlies want to fulfill that obligation this June. Memphis wound up in a three-way tie with Dallas and New Orleans for the 7-9 position. Whether the Grizzlies land in the ninth position or with the selection protected won\u2019t be known until after the May 14 draft lottery. The next Grizzlies coach will have Jaren Jackson Jr. who showed flashes as the fourth overall draft pick last summer before a deep thigh bruise sidelined him after 58 games. Dillon Brooks also was limited to 18 games by injuries, and Kyle Anderson, signed to a four-year deal last summer, played only 43 games and will have surgery next week on his right shoulder. Jonas Valanciunas, acquired in the February trade for Gasol, has a $17.6 million player option next season."},{"id":34370,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lauri-markkanen-cleared-basketball-activities","date":"2019-04-11","title":"Bulls' Markkanen cleared for basketball activities","content":"CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago Bulls forward Lauri Markkanen has been cleared to resume full basketball activities after missing the final two weeks of the season because of a heart problem.

Via a statement from the team , Kings GM Vlade Divac said Joerger had been relieved of his duties as coach, saying: \u201c After evaluating the season, I determined that we need to move in a different direction in order to take us to the next level. On behalf of the entire Kings organization, I want to thank Dave for his contributions to our team and I wish him all the best.\u201d News of the move began percolating Thursday shortly after the Kings gave GM Vlade Divac a contract extension that will keep him in that role until at least 2022-23. Shortly after that took place, news began to bubble up that Divac would be firing coach Dave Joerger by the end of the day. Per multiple reports \u2014 and first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski \u2014 the Kings intended to fire Joerger in a face-to-face meeting. That news was also confirmed by Sam Amick of The Athletic. Wojnarowski reports that Divac fired assistant general manager Brandon Williams earlier this morning. Per Wojnarowski, the relationship between Joerger and management may have lead to his ousting : Hours later, Wojnarowski reported the Kings had fired Joerger after three seasons on the job. Per reports, the Kings are considering several names for the opening, including Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton (if he becomes available) as well as former New Orleans Pelicans coach Monty Williams (who is currently an assistant coach on the Philadelphia 76ers). Additionally, San Antonio Spurs assistant Ettore Messina may also be up for the job as well. Joerger had one year remaining on his contract. Wojnarowski reported earlier on Thursday that Divac was \u201cpushing to consolidate his power\u201d as the top executive of the Kings and firing Joerger was part of that plan. Joerger had coached the Kings since 2016 and has helped the team steadily improve. Sacramento went 39-43 this year, its best record since its last playoff season in 2005-06.

The club has also added Jeff Bower as senior vice president of basketball operations and retained Trevor Bukstein as assistant general manager. Jones will oversee all basketball operations for the team with Bower and Bukstein reporting to him. \u201cJames has demonstrated a remarkable ability to manage the day-to-day efforts of our front office while developing strong relationships with our players, coaches and those across our organization and league,\u201d said Suns managing partner Robert Sarver. \u201cFurthermore, he is instilling the same championship culture and standard that he experienced on multiple occasions as a player. I have the utmost confidence in James as the leader of our basketball operations moving forward, and we are aligned in the ultimate goal of one day bringing an NBA championship to Phoenix.\u201d Jones has spent the last two seasons as the Suns\u2019 vice president of basketball operations, sharing general manager duties with Bukstein this past season where the two collaborated on trades which brought Kelly Oubre Jr. and Tyler Johnson to Phoenix. Since joining the Suns, Jones has lead the evaluation and evolution of team operations, and helped to build a stronger connection between the front office, players and team personnel. Jones joined the Suns\u2019 front office in 2017 following 14 seasons as a player where he was a three-time NBA Champion and reached the NBA Finals in each of his final seven seasons. During his playing career, Jones was one of the top executives with the National Basketball Players Association, spending several years on the NBPA\u2019s executive committee as secretary-treasurer.  As a player, Jones spent two seasons with the Suns and they were two of the most successful in franchise history as he was a member of the 2005-06 team that won 54 games and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, as well as the 2006-07 team that won 61 games and advanced to the Western Conference Semifinals. He contributed to two Pacific Division titles in his two seasons in Phoenix, averaging 7.8 points and 2.8 rebounds in 151 regular-season games with the team while shooting 38.2% from three-point range.  Overall, Jones appeared in 709 career regular-season games and 148 career playoff games over 14 seasons with Indiana (2003-2005), Phoenix (2005-2007), Portland (2007-08), Miami (2008-2014) and Cleveland (2014-2017). He never played for a team that finished below .500 and only once missed the playoffs, winning NBA titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, and with the Cavaliers in 2016. A member of the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame, Jones starred collegiately for the Hurricanes while earning a degree in finance. A veteran executive with over 30 years of basketball experience at the NBA and collegiate levels, Bower was most recently general manager of the Detroit Pistons from 2014-2018. During his time with the Pistons he revamped the team\u2019s roster, leading to a breakthrough season in 2015-16 when the Pistons went 44-38 (their first time finishing over .500 since 2007-08) and qualified for the 2016 NBA Playoffs (their first postseason appearance since 2009). As Detroit\u2019s general manager, Bower made a series of transactions including trades to acquire Tobias Harris and Reggie Jackson, the team\u2019s two leading scorers in 2015-16\u2019s return to the postseason. Bower later dealt a package centered on Harris to acquire Blake Griffin, who this season led the Pistons back to the Playoffs as he returned to the NBA All-Star Game for the first time since 2015. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to add an individual with Jeff\u2019s experience and basketball acumen to our front office,\u201d said Jones. \u201cJeff brings a wealth of knowledge in every facet of basketball operations, is of high character and well respected in league circles, and has a proven track record of influencing organizational success. His expertise in creating and executing a plan will be invaluable as we build our team moving forward.\u201d \u201cUnder James\u2019 leadership and with the addition of Jeff, our front office is diverse and complimentary in their backgrounds and skillsets, yet entirely aligned in their selfless and hard-working approach,\u201d added Sarver. \u201cI am confident today\u2019s announcement positions us strongly as we strive to shape the next great era of Phoenix Suns basketball.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m extremely appreciative of Robert and James for the opportunity to join the Suns organization,\u201d said Bower. \u201cWe have a talented young team with great potential and a bright future ahead, so I\u2019m anxious to get to work supporting James and the Phoenix Suns in every way I can.\u201d Bower had previously served two terms as general manager of the Charlotte\/New Orleans Hornets from 2001-2003 and 2005-2010. The Hornets made five postseason appearances during his time as general manager, highlighted by a franchise record 56 regular-season wins in 2007-08 and the first division title in team history before pushing the defending champion San Antonio Spurs to seven games in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following that season Bower finished third in voting for NBA Executive of the Year. During his tenures as general manager with the Hornets, Bower drafted two future NBA All-Stars in David West (18th in 2003) and Chris Paul (4th in 2005), and the team also drafted two future NBA All-Stars while he was director of scouting or assistant general manager with the team in Baron Davis (3rd in 1999) and Jamaal Magloire (19th in 2000).  He began his NBA career with the Hornets organization in 1995 as an advance scout then was promoted to director of scouting\/assistant coach after two years. Bower was the team\u2019s assistant general manager for the 2000-01 season before serving as general manager from 2001-2003. He was an assistant coach for the Hornets in 2003-04 and director of player personnel in 2004-05 before taking over as general manager again in 2005. In 2009-10, Bower served as New Orleans\u2019 head coach for the final 73 games of the season, posting a 34-39 record.  Bukstein will remain assistant general manager with the Suns, a position he has held since 2013. In his role, Bukstein combines his knowledge in the interpretation and application of the league\u2019s Collective Bargaining Agreement, salary cap management, trade and contract negotiations and scouting with his proficiency as a talent evaluator.  Prior to becoming assistant general manager, Bukstein spent three seasons as the Suns\u2019 director of basketball administration. He joined the Suns after six years as an athlete representation specialist at Williams and Connolly, LLP, where he assisted the sports law practice with its NBA, WNBA and MLB clients. Bukstein earned his law degree from the Georgetown University Law Center following his undergraduate work at the University of Michigan.

Now, the future \u2014 and free agency \u2014 loom for the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer. Walker can become a free agent on July 1 . The Hornets held their exit interviews today and Walker said he still wants to stick with the only NBA team he\u2019s ever known. But he also made it clear that the chance to win will be his top priority entering the summer. \u201cThis is where I want to be, that hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Walker said in videos posted by Rod Boone of The Athletic. \u201cI want to win. Like I said yesterday, that\u2019s something that I\u2019m going to have to really sit down and think about with my family, with my agent, with the people closest to me in my life that will help me make that decision.\u201d He offered little insight into whether he will be back after the Hornets were eliminated from playoff contention last night with a 122-114 loss to the Orlando Magic . \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Walker said after the game. \u201cI have a long time to even start thinking about that stuff. Me and my agent, my family, we will discuss that stuff when the time is right.\u201d However, Walker seemed to leave the door open to leaving, much more so than last September when he said at the Hornets media day that \u201cthis is where I want to be. I don\u2019t want to be nowhere else. I want to create something here.\u201d If last night was Walker\u2019s curtain call in Charlotte, he certainly left Hornets fans with something to remember. He scored 43 points on 16-of-25 shooting to go along with five assists. \u201cM-V-P!\u201d chants for Walker started midway through the fourth quarter after he scored his 39th point. He left the game to a standing ovation with 1:06 remaining and received a hug from coach James Borrego. After the game, Walker spent extra time on the floor hugging people. This season, Walker ranked 10th in the NBA in scoring (25.6 points per game), 20th in assists per game (5.9) and scored a career-best 60 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on Nov. 17. \u201cI love that kid,\u201d Borrego said of Walker. \u201cHe inspires me. I love coaching him, and I look forward to coaching him for many years to come. Obviously it\u2019s a big summer for us, but I believe in Kemba. I believe in that group and I think he was inspired by what he saw here down the stretch\u201d playing alongside the team\u2019s younger players like Miles Bridges and Dwayne Bacon. Walker\u2019s backup, veteran point guard Tony Parker, said during his exit interview Thursday that he is still weighing whether or not to play next season. Parker, a likely future Hall of Famer and former NBA Finals MVP, just finished his 18th season (his first with Charlotte) averaging 9.5 ppg, 1.5 rpg and 3.7 apg in 17.9 mpg. He signed a two-year deal with the Hornets last summer. Charlotte\u2019s loss ended Parker\u2019s string of 17 straight playoff appearances. Parker didn\u2019t have a say in the outcome and hasn\u2019t played in the team\u2019s last 13 games as Borrego elected to go with younger players. Aside from Walker, the Hornets potentially have eight other players who will be free agents this summer.

I look forward to our bright future ahead as we work to make Sacramento Proud.\u201d Divac will enter his fifth season as General Manager after taking the helm of Sacramento\u2019s front office at the start of the 2015-16 season. This season, under Divac\u2019s leadership, the franchise took a step forward and had their most wins (39-43) in over a decade. He is credited with creating a young, exciting team anchored by sophomore point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox and third-year shooting guard Buddy Hield, both of whom had career years. At the trade deadline, Divac added seven-year NBA veteran, member of the 2015 Golden State Warriors championship team and 2016 Olympic gold medalist Harrison Barnes to augment the roster. Last summer, Divac selected Marvin Bagley III (2nd overall) in the NBA Draft. Additional talent, recognized around the league for their skills, brought in by the former NBA-All Star includes second-year playmaker Bogdan Bogdanovic, center Willie Cauley-Stein, veteran forward Nemanja Bjelica and 2017 20th overall pick Harry Giles. Divac is one of the most respected and revered individuals in franchise history, an international basketball pioneer who helped pave the way for European players in the NBA and a global ambassador for the game. He is one of just seven players in the history of the NBA to record more than 13,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 3,000 assists and 1,500 blocks. His NBA career spanned 16 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1989-90 \u2013 1995-96, 2004-05), Charlotte Hornets (1996-98) and Sacramento Kings (1998-99 \u2013 2003-04). His six seasons in a Kings uniform marked the most successful period in team history, including six consecutive playoff appearances, back-to-back Pacific Division titles (2001-02, 2002-03) and a trip to the Western Conference Finals (2001-02). Divac\u2019s jersey was retired by the Kings in 2009. Off the court, Divac has been recognized for his work to use sports to bring people together. From 2009 to 2017, Divac served as the President of the Serbian Olympic Committee and since 2007, has worked to support international aid through the Ana and Vlade Divac Foundation. On Saturday, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced that Divac will be inducted in September as a member of the Class of 2019.

And I\u2019ll just come right out and say it: Luka Doncic is my pick to win this year\u2019s Kia Rookie of the Year. There\u2019s no reason to beat around the bush or put off the announcement. Doncic came out of the gate firing (and hitting), so why shouldn\u2019t I? The Slovenian, whom the Mavericks landed last June in a Draft-night trade with Atlanta (for, of course, fellow rookie Trae Young), arrived as a 19-year-old with three years of experience playing alongside seasoned professionals with Spain\u2019s Real Madrid. And it showed. Doncic displayed no fear or trepidation and captured the nation\u2019s hearts with his stepback 3-pointers, floaters in the lane, and all-around game that was far from what we\u2019re used to seeing from rookies. He was a game-changer, and the Mavericks have a transcendent player to take the reins after Dirk Nowizki\u2019s 21-year reign in Dallas . Sure, Young caught fire after the All-Star break to make things interesting, and he had some performances to remember. He had an incredible 49-point, 16-assist showing in a loss to the Chicago Bulls, becoming just the third rookie with a 40-10 game (joining LeBron James and Michael Jordan). He also had seven 30-point, 10-assist games , surpassing Stephen Curry and LeBron James for most ever by a rookie. By almost every metric, Doncic outpaced the field. He led all rookies in scoring while becoming the only rookie to average 20 points, seven rebounds and five assists since Oscar Robertson did it in 1961. He finished the season with eight triple-doubles , good enough for third-most by a rookie, behind Robertson and the reigning Kia ROY , the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Ben Simmons. And despite cooling off at the end of the season, he\u2019ll still finish with better effective field-goal and true shooting percentages than what Young boasts . But in the end, Young\u2019s slow start was just too much to overcome. He definitely made things interesting, and he should grab some votes, but Doncic gets my vote in what turned out to be a closer-than-expected race for Kia Rookie of the Year. * * * Last week:  No. 2 After falling to second for the last four Rookie Ladders, Doncic takes the top rung when it matters most. This piece gives extra weight to recent play, so Young deserved the first spot down the stretch. He was playing at a level that Doncic wasn\u2019t quite matching. But when you look at the body of work, which this final Rookie Ladder does, Doncic gets the final nod. Among his notable statistics, he finishes the season with eight triple-doubles, good enough for third most by a rookie (trailing only Robertson and Simmons). Years from now, when Doncic is a perennial All-Star and potential Kia MVP candidate, we\u2019ll look back at this rookie campaign fondly. It was a fun ride, and it was fun watching Doncic bring joy and passion to the court every night. Last week:  No. 1  If there was an award given to the best rookie after the All-Star break, Young would easily get it. What Young did offensively af ter the All-Star break was inspiring, and the fact that he actually made people reconsider Doncic for the top spot is worth praising. Young averaged 24.7 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.2 assists per game while shooting 44.2 percent from the field (34.8 percent on 3-pointers). The Hawks were 10-14 after the All-Star break and the signs are there that Young \u2014 alongside John Collins and whomever comes in the 2019 draft \u2014 and the Hawks have a bright future. \u201cBesides the one month (November) I didn\u2019t shoot the ball well, I think I had a really good season as far as making plays, getting my teammates involved and scoring when needed,\u201d Young told USA TODAY Sports . \u201cOne thing I wanted to do was bring life back to the city of Atlanta, and we\u2019ve done a great job of doing that.\u201d  Last week:  Not ranked Ayton had moments when he could disappear, but when you look at his whole rookie season, the numbers show the Suns have a potential All-Star big man they can build around. In 71 games, the No. 1 pick averaged 16.3 ppg (fourth) and 10.3 rpg (first) while shooting 58.5 percent. His defense is a work in progress, but he still managed to get a block and steal per game. \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen the trenches a little bit, but I won\u2019t say I went through all bad,\u201d Ayton said in his Suns exit interview . \u201cWe did a lot of great things, learned a lot of great things. I feel I definitely got better, stronger. Stronger mentally as well.\u201d Last week:  No. 3 The Kings were in playoff contention for most of the season, and Bagley\u2019s contributions off the bench were a big reason. Sacramento sought a long-term fit when they took Bagley second overall, and he proved his worth, especially down the stretch. He\u2019ll finish fifth among rookies in scoring (14.9 ppg) and third in rebounding (7.6) and his numbers after the All-Star break show his improvement ( 18.5 ppg and 9.2 rpg ). Kings fans might always wonder what could have been if they\u2019d grabbed Doncic, but if Bagley\u2019s first year is any indication, the Kings\u2019 fortunes are only going to improve with time. Last week:  No. 5 Sexton looked lost early in the season, leading many to wonder if he had what it took to be an NBA point guard. But by the end of March, those concerns were put to rest and Sexton proved he has a future as a scoring point guard. While he never put up big assist numbers (3.0 apg), Sexton will finish third among rookies in scoring (16.7 ppg) thanks to a March that saw him average 22.4 points on 51 percent shooting (44.7 on 3s). For the season (he played all 82 games), his shooting numbers are excellent \u2014 43 percent overall, 40.2 on 3-pointers (first among rookies), 83.9 on free throws (1st) \u2014 and actually better than both Doncic and Young. Jaren Jackson, Memphis Grizzlies Jackson only played 58 games (starting 56), before being sidelined in February by a right quad injury, but what he did in that time will earn him plenty of All-Rookie first team love. The lanky No. 4 pick averaged 13.8 points (sixth) and 4.7 rebounds (eighth) on 50.6 percent shooting (35.9 on 3-pointers) in 26.2 minutes per game. But Jackson also proved to be one of the best rookie defenders, getting 1.4 bpg (second) and 0.9 spg and will be a force on both ends for years to come. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers The point guard out of Kentucky was steady all season and was a big reason the Clippers are in the playoffs. He finishes ninth in scoring (10.8 points), but he was effective in getting his points, hitting at a 47.6 percent clip (36.7 on 3-pointers). He played all 82 games, starting 73 and got better as the season progressed. \u201cI was high on him,\u201d Rivers told The Athletic. \u201cI said it when we drafted him. I said, \u2018He\u2019s gonna be a star.\u2019 Then in camp, I was really high on him because you could just see it. I didn\u2019t know where he was going this year or when he was gonna get there. But he\u2019s gonna be really good. He\u2019s just going to keep getting better.\u201d Landry Shamet, LA Clippers Shamet\u2019s scoring numbers aren\u2019t staggering, but he was the best shooter of this class and did it for two playoff teams (the Sixers, then the Clippers after a midseason trade). He averaged 9.1 points while leading all rookies in 3-point shooting (42.2 percent, 11th among all players ). With the Clippers facing the Golden State Warriors in the first round, he\u2019ll be on a big stage while most other rookies are left watching. Mitchell Robinson, New York Knicks The Knicks had several rookies leave their mark. Kevin Knox had his ups and downs and finished as one of the Top 10 scorers . Allonzo Trier also ended up in the Top 10 . But the Knicks\u2019 best rookie may have been Robinson, who emerged as a defensive force, leading all rookies in blocks (2.4 per game, No. 2 overall in NBA ) while grabbing 6.4 rebounds per game (fifth) and scoring 7.3 points on 69.7 percent shooting. For a second-round pick, he might end up being a steal for New York. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, April 10 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

As fate would have it, the assist that completed his fifth career triple-double came on a mid-range jumper from longtime teammate Udonis Haslem, who like Wade began his career with Miami in 2003. The nostalgia overflowed in the presence of the complete \u201cbanana boat\u201d crew, each of whom embraced and congratulated Wade on a Hall-of-Fame career that began in 2003.

Yet it was with the ball itself that Wade spent his final possession of professional sports. He didn\u2019t shoot, pass or drive. He merely dribbled down the shot clock before tossing the ball to the official, choosing to end his last touch on the same terms as his last season: his own. \u201cThese 16 years have been way more than I could have imagined,\u201d Wade reflected. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of trials. It\u2019s been a lot of tribulations. It\u2019s been a lot of joy\u2026 I\u2019m just thankful.

Dirk broke down in tears after watching a tribute video made by the Spurs ahead of his final NBA game. pic.twitter.com\/N6NUXL9cZj \u2014 NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 11, 2019 The tears and bittersweetness were undoubtedly fresh for Nowitzki, who only just announced his official intent to retire 24 hours earlier. He followed that tender moment with a vintage double-double: 20 points and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes of action. His final basket came with under a minute remaining on an iconic fallaway from the high post. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who spent over 20 years game-planning to stop that nearly unguardable shot, unabashedly yelled at Drew Eubanks to let Nowitzki have that final attempt. Luckily, Eubanks\u2019 defense affected Nowitzki about as much as any other over his career. As raw as his final game must have felt, Nowitzki seemed at peace once the final buzzer sounded. \u201cI\u2019m kind of relieved it\u2019s over,\u201d Nowitzki said after the game. \u201cI can rest now and enjoy some wine and some food.\u201d Dirk: \u201cI\u2019m kind of relieved that it\u2019s over.

Another legend bid farewell to the NBA on Wednesday, one who mastered the microphone rather than the ball itself. Ralph Lawler, the newly minted Hall of Fame broadcaster for the LA Clippers, polished off his 40th and final regular season on media row in the Clippers\u2019 143-137 overtime win against Utah. He did so alongside former Clippers player and commentator Bill Walton. Lawler\u2019s positive demeanor never faltered during lean times with the Clippers franchise. And when L.A. surged, Lawler\u2019s iconic play calls punctuated the high points. Ralph Lawler is Clippers Basketball. Thank you, @Ohmeomy .

The Jam!\u201d and \u201cOh me, oh my!\u201d are no longer part of them. In an industry where local icons are few and far between, Lawler is among the best. NBA coaches normally trim down the number of players used in the postseason. Every possession matters, making experimentation an unaffordable venture. The Blazers provided a regular season preview of that aspect in Game No. 82, albeit in a fashion none expected. With playoff seeding still very much up for grabs, coach Terry Stotts opted to play just six players \u2014 including three all 48 minutes. Those three: Jake Layman, Anfernee Simons and Gary Trent Jr. Only one reserve (Zach Collins) saw playing time, and just 13 minutes at that. Against all odds, the unusual strategy paid off in the form of a 28-point comeback. Simons, who had scored 38 total points in his NBA career, nearly doubled that with a game-high 37. Who knows? With CJ McCollum tip-toeing his way back from injury and Jusuf Nurkic out for the playoffs, Stotts may just allow himself to throw one of those guys into the postseason fire. This season highlighted more than any other Kemba Walker\u2019s ties to Charlotte. The only Hornets-drafted All-Star since Baron Davis, Walker started in and hosted the 2019 All-Star Game. On Wednesday, the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer poured in 46 points in a last-ditch effort to sneak Charlotte into the playoffs. Detroit\u2019s victory at Orlando prevented that, leaving Walker with just two postseason appearances in his eight seasons with the Hornets. Coming off a career year in which he averaged 25.4 points per game, Walker is now an unrestricted free agent. The two-time All-Star will draw significant interest from a handful of teams boasting enough cap space to sign him. Charlotte faces the ultimate conundrum: keep its star at a price that will all but lock them into a subpar cast around Walker, or let him walk and attempt to rebuild in his wake. Whatever happens, there is no doubt that Walker will go down as one of the best to ever don the purple and teal.

And then, like magic, poof \u2014 or more like oof \u2014 Magic Johnson vanished and left the Lakers hanging. This was in 1994, when the most radiant superstar of his generation was a freshly retired player searching for a new way to be seen as a winner. And so Magic did something unorthodox and took the Lakers\u2019 coaching job , even though he\u2019d never coached before. He lasted all of 16 games before pulling the plug on a misguided experiment, and maybe that was the no-look pass we all should\u2019ve seen coming two decades later. Because once again, Magic failed in a poorly planned way to make an impact in the game other than running the fast break. In another bizarre moment to cap this season of several, he bailed on the Lakers again, this time as president of basketball operations after 14 months. He made that official with a spontaneous and confusing ramble moments before the season finale Tuesday. Looking weary and feeling weepy, Magic began with: \u201cI cried before I came here and I\u2019m about to cry now\u201d and then calling his decision, which seemed rash, \u201ca tough thing.\u201d He added: \u201cYou gotta be happy. I gotta be happy.\u201d Nobody had an advance heads-up, most notably Jeanie Buss, the principal owner who put her reputation on the line in 2017 by putting Magic in charge shortly after wrestling control of the club from Jim Buss in a family takeover. And now, what exactly has changed since the dreadful era of Jeanie Buss\u2019 baseball cap-wearing bro? The Lakers, who haven\u2019t made the playoffs in six years and just put the wraps on a lost season with LeBron James in the fold, remain an organization that\u2019s been frantically searching for traction ever since the passing of the great Jerry Buss. For her part, Buss struck a loyal pose next to Johnson in the wake of his about-face, having a Lakers-issued statement that was all good: \u201cWe are deeply grateful for all Magic has done for our franchise \u2014 as a player, an ambassador and an executive.\u201d Buss also sent a social media love-letter that read in part: \u201cYou\u2019ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.\u201d Where there were once cheers, there now echo snickers directed toward these 16-time champions, who find themselves keeping company with castoffs and retreads. It\u2019s a bad look and it comes at a vulnerable time, as the Lakers soon embark on a summer of searching for a star to salvage what\u2019s left of LeBron\u2019s career. That will be done without Magic at the helm after he concluded he wasn\u2019t made everything the job entails after all. Magic quit because he couldn\u2019t be Magic anymore, not in the way he wanted to be, not in the special and fawning way folks treated him prior to this trainwreck. In particular, those close to him say he hated criticism of his personnel decisions. And that volume was turned up the last few months after the botched Anthony Davis trade attempt at the deadline, then again when the Lakers looked feeble on the floor down the stretch with and without LeBron, costing the club a playoff spot. For someone so beloved, someone who sits on the Mount Rushmore of Los Angeles sports figures, that negativity has stung, particularly in this social media age during which there\u2019s no escaping the glare. Too often, the basketball public reminded Magic of those he threw off the Lakers\u2019 boat as president \u2014 chief among them the young point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, diminished by Magic for being unfit to lead the Lakers. Russell is now an All-Star on playoff-bound Brooklyn . There were others: Lou Williams, Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr., Brook Lopez, heck even Ivica Zubac, who was dealt at mid-season . All of them are thriving in other uniforms and causing second-guesses. Yet Johnson\u2019s tenure wasn\u2019t a total loss: Kyle Kuzma and cap space came in the Russell trade, he drafted Lonzo Ball (who has has shown flashes of promise between injuries) and the Lakers are in position to sign one or multiple free agents this summer thanks to Magic\u2019s fierce protection of salary cap space. Running a team means plenty of unglamorous grunt work: film sessions, scouting, planning, dealing with agents, putting out fires, being accountable and sitting at the desk where the buck stops. It\u2019s the sort of behind-the-scenes, no-glory duties that convince superstars to seek another line of work when they\u2019re done playing. So many all-time greats fail to find equal footing as general managers or team presidents because of those very details, and also because of their own impatience in dealing with lesser players. Jerry West is the exception \u2014 and what must \u201cThe Logo\u201d be thinking about his old team today, as he steers the playoff-bound Clippers across town? Was Magic willing to do what was necessary to thrive in that big chair? Or when he attended the NCAA Tournament recently, did he get more satisfaction from rooting on his beloved Michigan State than charting the strengths and flaws of top Draft prospects? And what about deciding the future of coach Luke Walton, who dodged bullets all season? There is ample reason to believe Magic wanted to fire Walton as soon as today but felt a measure of resistance from Buss. She never publicly insisted Walton was safe, yet never hesitated to show her warm feelings for him, either. Those who know Magic say he didn\u2019t want to deal with that fallout. Johnson left it all very vague. He spoke about \u201call the backstabbing\u201d without elaborating. He appeared drained by the experience and the exit. It took something from him, stole some of his \u201cjoy.\u201d There were rumors about a team uprising in which a group of employees expressed annoyance at Magic\u2019s leadership. Perhaps that contributed.  Another theory, floated by NBA types: Johnson knew, or had a strong hunch, that an empty summer was in store for him and the Lakers and maybe it was time to bow out now and not take those arrows. If the Lakers fail to get Davis \u2014 again \u2014 and also whiff on A-list free agents (like Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard), it both damages the perception of the Lakers as a destination franchise while destroying the notion of Johnson being a magnet. This all will stick to him and his legacy off the court, astonishing for someone who succeeded in business but airballed all the pure basketball opportunities created for him by the Lakers and the Buss family. The Lakers must regroup. Buss needs to repair a fractured front office, injecting competent leaders who can make sense of the roster and put forth a stated and realistic goal. Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, a former agent, handles the Lakers\u2019 financial nuts and bolts next to Magic. If that remains the same, then the Lakers need an experienced president who knows the turf. Most of all, they\u2019re up against a pair of clocks. One is set toward the Draft and the summer, when the Lakers will chase the level of talent that can help them win now. The second clock is set to LeBron. He turns 35 next season, with three years left on his contract, and a deep well of resolve about to be tested. How can they maximize whatever he has left? Or do they \u2026 trade him? It\u2019s all muddled and perplexing, a new normal for the Lakers. The proud former championship machine finds itself at the crossroads once again. It has been a steep fall, from the mountaintop of prime Kobe Bryant to the laughingstock of Tuesday\u2019s shocking revelation. Johnson made his decision. He checked out, believing it will be good for him. And, perhaps, it will be good for the franchise, too. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He remains under contract for the Pelicans, who are also searching for a new GM after firing Dell Demps roughly a week after the NBA trade deadline ( when Davis was not moved ). Davis told reporters that he\u2019s not worried about who the next GM of the team is, but that he wants to speak with whomever that is about his trade request. \u201cI\u2019m under contract still,\u201d Davis said, per Nick Friedell of ESPN . \u201cI have a year left.

This morning, Davis explained why he wore that shirt in what could be his final game with the team. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose it. I actually didn\u2019t choose it. It was hanging for me already when I put my clothes on,\u201d Davis said. When asked if he knows who hung it up for him, Davis said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d When the game ended, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry described Davis as \u201ca great kid\u201d who \u201cgot some bad advice,\u201d referring to Davis\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, who also represents LeBron James and who orchestrated a public, mid-season trade demand for which Davis was fined $50,000. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing wrong with A.D.,\u201d Gentry added. \u201cHe\u2019s a good, solid guy with good character.\u201d News of the Pelicans beginning their search for a new GM circulated recently, with several names in the mix. Among them are Pelicans interim general manager Danny Ferry, former Cleveland Cavaliers general manager David Griffin, Golden State assistant GM Larry Harris, Brooklyn Nets assistant GM Trajan Langon, Houston Rockets assistant GM Gersson Rosas and interim Washington president of basketball operations Tommy Sheppard. New Orleans\u2019 next GM is expected to oversee a Davis trade \u2014 which could take place as early as this offseason \u2014 that has the potential to set the course of the franchise for years to come. That person also could decide the fate of Gentry, who has coached the team the last four seasons and oversaw the team\u2019s run to the 2018 Western Conference semifinals . Overall this season, Davis averaged 25.9 points, 12 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.6 steals and 2.4 blocks per game. He appeared in 56 games, a career-low, and saw downturns in his overall shooting (51.7 percent) and 3-point shooting (33.1 percent) from 2018-19. Following the Feb. 7 trade deadline, Davis never played more than 34 minutes in a game . Davis was recently fined $15,000 by the NBA after he made an obscene gesture to a fan after a 115-109 home loss to the Charlotte Hornets on April 3.

According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , Minnesota is finalizing plans to keep general manager Scott Layden and coach Ryan Saunders in their respective roles for the long term. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on what the Wolves are thinking next: However, there may be conflicting reports about the future of Layden and Saunders as Chris Pine of the Star Tribune reports nothing has been decided about the fates of Saunders and Layden . Team owner Glen Taylor issued a statement Wednesday that said the team has begun its search for a new president of basketball operations. That position has been vacant since Tom Thibodeau was fired earlier in the season. The team said no timetable has been set for the search and no further updates will be provided until the search is over. \u201cIn the absence of Tom, I want to thank all who picked up his responsibilities this past year. This includes Interim Head Coach Ryan Saunders, General Manager Scott Layden and our entire basketball staff for their efforts leading our team through the 2018-19 season,\u201d Taylor said in the statement. \u201cThey worked through a season with many injuries requiring many challenges in our player lineup. We are incredibly grateful to them for all of their hard work and commitment to the franchise.\u201d \u201cThe future of the Minnesota Timberwolves continues to be very bright. It\u2019s more important than ever that we find a leader who can build a successful team in today\u2019s fast-paced NBA. We have the cornerstones of a very talented team and need to assemble the final pieces that will elevate us into a playoff team and one that can compete for championships.\u201d Pine reports that the feeling around the Wolves is that Saunders is in good standing with Taylor to get the coaching job full-time. Hiring a new president could affect that, though. Overall, it looks solid for Saunders to remain in his role as he and Taylor have a good relationship and Saunders has publicly expressed a desire to remain in his post. As for Layden, that the future looks a little more uncertain for him. Here\u2019s more from Pine: A former general manager of the Knicks, Layden is concluding his third full season as the Timberwolves GM. That time has included both the acquisition and departure of Jimmy Butler via trade, as well as maximum contract extensions for former No. 1 overall picks Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. The 32-year-old Saunders, a long-time NBA assistant coach and son of the late Flip Saunders, a longtime Timberwolves front office executive and coach, became the youngest coach in the league upon taking over for Thibodeau earlier this season. Minnesota has gone 17-23 since, with Towns averaging 26.8 points, 12.6 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.4 blocks in that span. A subsequent report by Jon Krawcynski of The Athletic seemed to indicate a president would be hired prior to any announcement."},{"id":34435,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dirk-nowitzki-announces-retirement","date":"2019-04-10","title":"Nowitzki officially announces retirement","content":" It took a heartfelt display of career reflection and nostalgic chants of \u201cM-V-P\u201d for Dirk Nowitzki to finally say aloud what the basketball world has assumed all season. \u201cAs you might expect,\u201d Nowitzki told the sold-out crowd at American Airlines Center, \u201cthis was my last home game. \u201cThis is obviously super, super emotional. Just too many people to really thank. I put you guys on a helluva ride with a lot of ups and downs, and you guys always stuck with me and supported me, so I appreciate it.\u201d Just like that, the best player in Mavericks history officially ended a 21-year, future Hall-of-Fame career. Nowitzki rose from an unknown foreign Draft prospect to a league MVP and NBA champion while revolutionizing the game with his combination of height and shooting touch. In doing so, he lifted Dallas from its doldrums to perennial contention and league-wide respect. For that and much more, Mavericks fans serenaded Nowitzki with one chant just as heartfelt as the one before: \u201cTHANK YOU DIRK.\u201d That followed messages of admiration and appreciation NBA legends in attendance. Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp and countryman Detlef Schrempf spoke in honor of the player who was shown in an old video listing each of them as among those he idolized growing up in Germany. \u201cThe only guy that was missing was MJ,\u201d Nowitzki said, referring to Michael Jordan \u2014 the player he passed to become the oldest to score at least 30 in a game. \u201cThat was my No. 1. They brought Larry Legend. I mean, it\u2019s, that was an emotional moment when I saw all five of them and I was in shock really.\u201d Nowitzki never shared his retirement plans because he didn\u2019t want a farewell tour, but he also said he only began serious deliberations on retirement when his lower body gave him issues late in the season. The 14-time All-Star got the farewell treatment on the road anyway, with opposing fans chanting \u201cWe want Dirk\u201d and giving him standing ovations, and LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers stopping a game , grabbing a public address microphone and honoring Nowitzki. It should happen again Wednesday night in San Antonio, Dallas\u2019 season finale. Nowitzki said he gave almost all he had in the final home game but wanted to put up a few more jumpers against probably the biggest rival of his career. During Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, though, owner Mark Cuban had nothing but praise and fondness for Nowitzki. \u201cThere\u2019s no words that I could possibly say to describe how I feel what you meant to this organization, but I can make you all kinds of promises,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cI\u2019ll promise you that you have a job for life. I don\u2019t care what you do. I\u2019ll promise you that we\u2019ll retire your number, not a tough decision. And I\u2019ll promise you we will put the biggest \u2026 statue ever. And we\u2019ll put it right in front of the arena.\u201d Even in the company of so many legends, the night belonged to Nowitzki, the only one among them to have scored more than 30,000 career points. The man behind that achievement and legacy, the 7-foot German said, will remain in Dallas long after his playing career ends. \u201cThis is my new home,\u201d Nowitzki said to a roar of approval. \u201cI left Germany over 20 years ago and became a Texan.\u201d Nowitzki said he had broken down emotionally a few times in private since deciding in recent days that it was time to retire, including on the day of his final home game with his wife, Jessica Nowitzki, after putting on the suit he wore to the arena. But the league\u2019s 2007 MVP and 2011 NBA Finals MVP also knew how difficult the past two seasons had been physically, including missing the first 26 games of his final campaign after a longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery last April. Nowitzki was experiencing flare-ups in his feet and ankles late this season. \u201cIt takes a lot at 40 to get ready every night and then with the foot pain,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cIt just took a little bit of the fun away from the sport I love. I think that actually made the decision easier for me.\u201d The highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history has 31,540 points with a game left. Nowitzki eclipsed 10,000 defensive rebounds late this season \u2014 and fans who went wild nearly every time he hit a shot even cheered those moments. The only 7-footer to win the All-Star 3-point shooting contest was the first player of his size to be a legitimate threat behind the arc. All of the game\u2019s biggest stars say that dimension changed the game, and many of them emulated his signature one-legged fadeaway jumper \u2013 the shot he used on his final bucket at home late in the fourth quarter. \u201cYou want to leave the game in a better place than you got it, and you\u2019ve done that,\u201d Kemp said during the postgame ceremony. \u201cNot only did you bring a championship to Dallas, you are a champion.\u201d With one more game before his final goodbye.

The decision comes a little more than two years after he took on the position in an effort to restore one of the league\u2019s most storied franchises to championship contention. Johnson made the announcement immediately after coach Luke Walton\u2019s pregame comments, adding that he had not yet informed team owner Jeanie Buss of his intentions to step down. \u201cI like to be free,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a great life\u2026 what am I doing? I\u2019ve got a beautiful life. I\u2019m gonna go back to that beautiful life. I\u2019m looking forward to it. Somebody is going to have to tell my boss, because I know she\u2019s going to be sick. But I knew I couldn\u2019t face her face-to-face and tell her.\u201d Johnson didn\u2019t directly tie his decision to the future of Walton, but the third-year coach was widely expected to be fired by Johnson. Without using names, Johnson repeatedly mentioned Buss\u2019 affinity for Walton, who was in place before Johnson got his job in February 2017, and Johnson\u2019s desire not to cause upheaval between the owner and her chosen coach. \u201c(On Wednesday) I would have to affect somebody\u2019s livelihood and their life,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd I thought about it and I said, \u2018That\u2019s not fun for me. That\u2019s not who I am.\u2019 And then I don\u2019t want to put her in the middle of us, even though she said, \u2018Hey, you can do what you want to do.\u2019 I know she has great love for him and great love for me.\u201d Johnson and Buss had a three-hour meeting Monday about the direction of the 16-time NBA champion Lakers, who haven\u2019t made the postseason since 2013. Magic claimed he didn\u2019t finalize his decision until Tuesday morning. Buss didn\u2019t attend the Lakers\u2019 season finale, although Johnson waited by the executive parking area at Staples Center in hopes of seeing her. Buss tweeted her reaction at halftime. \u201cWe thank him for his work these past two years as our President of Basketball Operations,\u201d the team said in a statement , \u201cand wish him, Cookie, Andre, EJ and Elisa all the best with their next steps. He will always be not only a Lakers icon, but our family.\u201d Via Twitter, Buss said: \u201cEarvin, I loved working side by side with you. You\u2019ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.\u201d Johnson repeatedly cited the need for freedom of interaction and expression with other players as a key reason behind his decision. The Lakers were fined more than once for tampering that stemmed from Johnson referencing pending free agents or discussing off-court interactions with players of opposing teams under contract. \u201cI want to be free and not have handcuffs on me,\u201d Johnson admitted. Walton, who is 98-148 in three seasons, refused to say much about Johnson\u2019s announcement after the loss to Portland: \u201cI found out when you guys did. It was 80 minutes before the game \u2026 and I haven\u2019t had any time to really process it.\u201d Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports later reported that Buss had given Johnson her permission to fire Walton before the Lakers\u2019 president of basketball operations ultimately decided to step down instead. \u201cIt\u2019s the right move to make,\u201d Johnson emotionally added, \u201cthen, that way, he can stay in place, hopefully coach the team the right way.\u201d Johnson\u2019s desire for his old life wasn\u2019t the only reason for his departure. He also said he is tired of being investigated or fined by the NBA for tampering when he comments on basketball on Twitter or even speaks to another organization\u2019s player. Johnson, a longtime broadcaster and respected basketball figure before moving into the front office, has been investigated four times for tampering after everything from a joking comment about Paul George on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s talk show to his response to an email sent to him by Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons. \u201cI thought about Dwyane Wade retiring (Wednesday), and I can\u2019t even tweet that out or be there,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSerena Williams called me a week ago and said, `Will you mentor me and be on my advisory board?\u2019 And I said, `Yeah, I\u2019m going to do that.\u2019 So when Ben Simmons called and we went through the proper channels and they made me look like the bad guy out of that situation, but I didn\u2019t do anything wrong \u2026 I was thinking about all those times, all those guys who want me to mentor them or be a part of their lives, and I can\u2019t even do that. I had more fun on the other side.\u201d The legend-turned-executive was a key figure in the Lakers\u2019 recruitment of LeBron James last summer as well as an initial supporter of former No. 2 overall pick Lonzo Ball. Yet Johnson and the Lakers\u2019 front office faced scrutiny for their other moves, including the role players they signed around James, their inability to acquire Anthony Davis at the trade deadline, and the emergence of former Laker D\u2019Angelo Russell after being dealt to Brooklyn in 2017. As for his own team, Johnson remained adamant that the Lakers are already \u201cheaded in the right direction.\u201d \u201cNext year we\u2019re going to be good. If we get one of these [free agents], we\u2019re going to be really good. \u201cI\u2019m good with where I am,\u201d a relieved Johnson acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019m happy. I want to do the things I used to do. I had to weigh both situations and this is better for me.\u201d Johnson, who will turn 60 in August, also has many thriving business interests along with ownership stakes in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles FC. Johnson\u2019s sudden decision ends another chapter in the remarkable life of the star point guard from Lansing, Michigan, who won an NCAA championship at Michigan State before claiming five NBA titles and three league MVP awards during his 12-year playing career as the leader of the Showtime Lakers. Johnson retired in 1991 after he tested positive for HIV, but later returned briefly to the Lakers as a player and a coach. Johnson says his current health is ideal, and he insists no health concerns were part of his decision to quit the job that seemed to be his ultimate destiny. Johnson was hired along with Pelinka when Buss dismissed her brother, Jim, and GM Mitch Kupchak just 26 months ago. The Buss children\u2019s father, Jerry, had long envisioned Johnson in a powerful role in the Lakers\u2019 front office, and Jeanie put Magic in charge of shaking up her storied franchise in decline. The Lakers compiled their best record in six years this season, but were eliminated from playoff contention by Russell\u2019s Nets back on March 22. Los Angeles had never missed the playoffs in more than two consecutive seasons before this six-year drought. Johnson remained publicly supportive of Walton, but Magic also was widely known to agree with Walton\u2019s detractors who aren\u2019t impressed by his offensive game planning and rotations. Johnson\u2019s decision to step down likely means the Lakers won\u2019t make a decision on Walton\u2019s future until a new front office is in place.

Before, during and after that moment, though, the night belonged to Heat icon and former Finals MVP Dwyane Wade. Tuesday\u2019s game marked the 576th and final time he plays at AmericanAirlines Arena as the Heat were eliminated from playoff contention by evening\u2019s end . Emotions were running high across the NBA world for a player who has not only excelled on the court, but made a vast impact off it. Throughout the season, Wade has swapped jerseys with today\u2019s NBA stars , former teammates and some long-ago rivals. Budweiser unveiled a video Turesday afternoon in which Wade receives five more special jerseys \u2026 with only one of them actually being a jersey at all . In the video, Wade has \u201cno idea who is coming\u201d, only to find the people meeting him are fans whom he has helped in his off-the-court ventures. Each of the fans are waiting with items to swap with Wade, telling the story of how Wade impacted their lives. One of the more powerful moments comes when the sister of Joaquin Oliver, Andrea Ghersi, talks with Wade. Oliver, one of the 17 victims killed in the Feb. 14, 2018 shootings at Parkland\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was buried in his Wade No. 3 Heat jersey on Feb. 17. Ghersi shares how the family decided to give Oliver\u2019s high school jersey to Wade. Other guests include a man who was helped by some words from Wade \u201c12 years ago\u201d, a woman who was treated to a Christmas shopping spree by Wade after her house burned down 10 days before Christmas and another woman who was able to attend college thanks to Wade\u2019s scholarship. Wade\u2019s mother, Jolinda, spoke of how Wade stood by her as she fought to overcome her past as an inmate, a drug user and drug seller. She praises her son for that and for helping her buy a church \u2014 the Temple of Praise in Chicago \u2014 in 2008 . Aside from that video, Miami Heat president Pat Riley talks in an interview published by the NBA\u2019s Twitter account about what Wade means to him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t easy to play for, but I think everybody felt that I wanted the very best for them,\u201d Riley says in the video. \u201cAnd I think Dwyane, from the very first day, I just loved his competitive nature. He\u2019s special, really unique and special. So how do I feel about him? I love the guy. I\u2019ve been around him 16 years and there isn\u2019t anybody that ever played in Miami that will have a bigger legacy than Dwyane. Nobody. \u201cI think everybody saw something absolutely unique athletically. He was the best in the world in 2006, above everybody. It\u2019s going to be a sad day when he retires. It really will be. But it will be a great day for him because he knows he\u2019s gotten everything out of the game. A player of his generation unlike any other.\u201d Tributes came last night in various forms. There was a pregame series of events inside the arena. There were videos. Wade addressed the crowd before and after the game. Celebrities were in attendance. Wade\u2019s children were in attendance. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, the school where the Feb. 14, 2018 massacre that left 17 dead in an event that touched Wade so deeply \u2014 not just because Oliver was buried in a Wade jersey \u2014 performed the national anthem. * Re-live Wade\u2019s season-long jersey swaps For Wade, after 16 seasons as an NBA player, after three championships, an almost-annual spot in the All-Star Game, a scoring title, three franchises, four children, an Olympic gold medal and 161 teammates, the end may have arrived. \u201cI gave this game everything I had,\u201d Wade said recently . \u201cAnd I have appreciated every bit of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Wade said. \u201cA lot of people in that arena have watched me grow, have watched me be imperfect, have watched me make a lot of mistakes in life, as well as watched me blossom and watched me do amazing things, great things. I\u2019m thankful for it.\u201d Wade \u201cL3GACY\u201d shirts were given to fans last night, some of whom spent thousands for their seats. In addition, there were Wade commemorative lanyards and Wade apparel. Some arena workers asked if they could be excused from wearing the usual game-night garb and don Wade jerseys instead. Fans flew in from as far as Australia and China. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sent his regards in a video. Wade is beloved in Miami, of course, for obvious reasons. Beloved in Chicago, too, his hometown. Beloved in Milwaukee, where he took Marquette to a Final Four in 2003. And this farewell tour \u2014 the \u201cOne Last Dance\u201d \u2014 is a league-wide victory lap for someone NBA players rave about. \u201cA legend,\u201d Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry said. \u201cStill amazing,\u201d Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic said. \u201cMy idol,\u201d Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal said. \u201cA leader,\u201d Detroit\u2019s Wayne Ellington said. \u201cTrue winner,\u201d Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker said. Wade isn\u2019t 2008 Wade, or Big 3-era Wade, or NBA Finals MVP Wade anymore. But he\u2019s still superb, and with a flair for the dramatic \u2014 such as the buzzer-beater to top Golden State a few weeks ago. He\u2019s been the best Heat player all season. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Miami will replace him next season, because he is going to be clearly missed. But that\u2019s also part of the reason why this season is his last. Wade didn\u2019t want to go out as a shell of his former self. He wanted to leave the stage with the fans clamoring for more, and that is precisely what has occurred. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweet part of it, seeing him be able to go off on his own terms, saying when he\u2019s done,\u201d said his former teammate and still-close friend LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cNobody forced him out or did anything of that nature.

Disappointing as that must have been for a team that stumbled down the stretch, the result wasn\u2019t nearly enough to overshadow a far more important occasion: The final regular-season home game for franchise icon Dwyane Wade, who will retire after 14-plus seasons with the Heat, and 16 overall. A similar scene unfolded roughly 1,100 miles away in Dallas, where the Mavericks and their faithful bid farewell to Dirk Nowitzki in what he announced would also be his final regular-season home contest following their 120-109 victory over the Suns. Key figures in two Finals clashes, in 2006 and 2011, the two giants entered Tuesday\u2019s action having combined for: And even then, with resumes polished enough to earn first-ballot entry into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, numbers and accolades don\u2019t come close to capturing the devotion both players earned in their respective cities, not only with superlative play, but also the manner in which they embraced their roles as team talismans. That affection was in full force at both arenas \u2014 in Nowitzki\u2019s case, as soon as he entered the building with a gauntlet of team and stadium employees lining up to lavish the 21-year veteran with high fives and cheers. Nowitzki was clearly up for the moment as he scored the Mavericks\u2019 first 10 points against Phoenix \u2014 fittingly, on two 3-pointers and a pair of signature turnaround jumpers \u2014 and 30 overall, to more than quadruple his season scoring average. (The old man even dunked in warmups! ) The Mavericks treated him to a lengthy postgame ceremony, which featured appearances from fellow legends like Larry Bird, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen, each of whom Nowitzki idolized during his youth in Germany. Nowitzki followed that up by announcing, after a season of speculation, that he will indeed be retiring after tonight\u2019s finale in San Antonio. \u201cAs you might expect, this was my last home game,\u201d Nowitzki said, as chants of \u201cThank you, Dirk!\u201d rained down from the stands. \u201cThis is obviously super, super emotional. I put you guys on a hell of a ride, with a lot of ups and downs, but you always supported me, so I appreciate it. I\u2019m really speechless. I left Germany over 20 years ago, and I became a Texan.\u201d Said Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, \u201cThere are no words I could possibly say to describe how I feel about what you\u2019ve meant to this organization. But I promise you, everything you taught us will continue. I promise you that you have a job for life, I don\u2019t care what you do. I promise you, we will retire your number. And I promise you, we will get the biggest, most bad-ass statue ever and we\u2019ll put it right in front of the arena. There will never be anybody like you, Dirty.\u201d The Heat went all-out with their own festivities at AmericanAirlines Arena. That included an emotional career retrospective ; in-game tributes from the likes of former president \u2014 and fellow Chicago native \u2014 Barack Obama , NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Wade\u2019s wife, the actor Gabrielle Union, as well as an introduction video narrated by his son, Zaire . And just like Nowitzki did in Dallas, and as the two legends have done so many times over the years, Wade rose to the occasion as well. He dunked for Miami\u2019s first points of the game, and finished with 30; the total marked his second-highest output in 71 appearances this season. That led to further celebration after the game as Wade presented each of teammates \u2014 all of whom he individually thanked during his pregame address \u2014 with autographed No. 3 jerseys before speaking to the crowd one more time. \u201cMy thoughts are all over the place,\u201d Wade said after the game, a 122-99 victory over Philadelphia. \u201cI think about the moment my agent came to the table in 2003 and told me the Heat were about to pick me at five (in the draft). It was a numb feeling, similar to what I\u2019m feeling now. But from the first conversation I had in this building, I heard the love. And I appreciated it then, and I more than appreciate it now. So I\u2019m sitting here the most thankful person right now. \u201cWade County \u2014 I love you.\u201d While the Mavericks and the Heat lavished appreciation on their departing heroes, the Lakers were completely blindsided by a legend of their own as president of basketball operations Magic Johnson announced minutes before tipoff of their home game with the Blazers that he was stepping down after barely two years on the job : Buss later tweeted her appreciation for Johnson, who joined the Lakers as a rookie out of Michigan State in 1979 before leading them to five championships in his 12-plus seasons. With Detroit\u2019s triumph over Memphis, just one playoff berth remains unclaimed entering tonight\u2019s finale, and the circumstances couldn\u2019t be simpler: The Pistons will clinch the last spot in the Eastern Conference with a victory at New York, while the Hornets will edge them at the finish line with a Pistons defeat and a home victory over Orlando.  There\u2019s still much to be determined seeding-wise, however, with only seven of 16 playoff berths locked in: So, excluding those teams, Orlando and current West No. 3 Houston, which is locked in at 53-29 after its heartbreaker at Oklahoma City, here are the final games for the six other squads that have clinched spots but are still fighting for position: Brooklyn, No. 6 in East \u2014 vs. Miami Denver, No. 2 in West \u2014 vs. Minnesota Portland, No. 4 in West \u2014 vs. Sacramento Oklahoma City, No. 6 in West \u2014 at Milwaukee San Antonio, No. 7 in West \u2014 vs. Dallas LA Clippers, No. 8 in West \u2014 vs. Utah A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. *** Sure, why not? A buzzer-beater on a night brimming with news and circumstance. Staving off what would have been a disastrous loss to the Lakers, Moe Harkless sank a wide-open corner 3 as time expired to ensure home-court advantage in the first round for the Trail Blazers. DIFFICULTY: The Blazers couldn\u2019t have asked for a much better shot as the Lakers trapped Damian Lillard, who passed off to C.J. McCollum, who then found Harkless all alone in the right corner. Harkless is only a 28 percent shooter from long range, but his stroke was true to beat the Lakers\u2019 sluggish defensive rotation. CELEBRATION: Harkless got the standard mobbing from his teammates, who were obviously excited but also more than a little relieved to avoid a brutal defeat to a Lakers team that has been on vacation watch for weeks. GRADE: With home court in the first round already clinched,  Harkless\u2019 shot could pay further dividends for the Blazers, who now have a shot at third in the West and, far more importantly, avoiding a potential second-round matchup with the deadly Warriors. Three-and-a-half Horrys. While it wasn\u2019t a buzzer-beater, Thunder star Paul George came through with a clutch 3 of his own, hitting from the left corner with 1.8 seconds left to edge the Rockets 112-111 . The bucket capped Oklahoma City\u2019s rally from 14 down with 9:26 remaining, and kept the Thunder a game up on San Antonio and the LA Clippers in sixth place in the Western Conference. It didn\u2019t come without a huge stroke of luck, however, as NBA scoring champ James Harden misfired despite somehow getting wide open for a 3 of his own as time expired. While it would have been impossible to divert the spotlight in Dallas, Suns veteran Jamal Crawford did his best with a 51-point outburst that, at 39 years old, made him the oldest player to reach the 50-point threshold. Including previous outbursts for the Warriors, Bulls and Knicks, Crawford also became the first player to score 50-plus with four different franchises.

Dan Gilbert, who has owned the Cavaliers since 2005, said he understands if fans are unhappy with the new name. There was a similar sentiment when the 19,000-seat building, which opened in 1994, went from being Gund Arena to Quicken Loans. \u201cI know that sometimes (with) change, you get a little resistance and people say, \u2018Why are they changing it?\u2019 and \u2018How\u2019s that name going to work?\u2019 \u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWe heard that initially when it was the Gund Arena to Quicken Loans Arena.

He makes plays during times of the game when he would have been sitting on the bench. The Toronto Raptors forward might be the leading candidate for the most improved player award and he\u2019d like to win it. But he\u2019s already received recognition that means more to him. Fellow players have noticed how much work he\u2019s put in and how much it has paid off this season. The acknowledgement from All-Stars such as Paul George and Bradley Beal shows that Siakam\u2019s giant leap has caught the attention of more than just the media panel that votes for the NBA awards. \u201cI just enjoy sometimes after the games, guys coming up to me and showing respect for me. That\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t care about the rest. I think when your peers respect your game and respect the fact that they\u2019ve seen you work, I think that\u2019s more important.\u201d There\u2019s a lot for them to have noticed, including: \u2014 Siakam\u2019s scoring. It is up from 6.0 points per game through his first two seasons to 17.0 this season. \u2014 His 3-point shooting. That\u2019s jumped from 21.6 percent to 36.8 percent. A player who was feared almost entirely for his work around the basket now has to be accounted for even when he\u2019s away from it. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson called Siakam an X-factor who now demands a much bigger part of the scouting report. \u201cIt changes because he\u2019s shooting the ball better,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cI think at first you could ignore his shot. Now it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to respect him from 3 and I know he\u2019s worked on it extremely hard, so that changes it. \u201cYou could be in the paint, wait for his drives. You still have to respect (that) but I think he keeps getting better and better.\u201d D\u2019Angelo Russell, Atkinson\u2019s All-Star point guard, might be the other top candidate for most improved player after leading the Nets to a surprising playoff berth. Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, Denver\u2019s Malik Beasley and the Clippers\u2019 Montrezl Harrell are some other players worthy of consideration. But of them, Siakam has the biggest role on the team with the best chance to be playing into June. The Raptors made major changes after they were swept out of the postseason by LeBron James and Cleveland in consecutive years. Dwane Casey was fired even after winning coach of the year honors, and All-Star DeMar DeRozan was dealt to San Antonio in the trade to bring in Kawhi Leonard. The Raptors have come back with 57 wins and the second-best record in the East, with Siakam\u2019s growth central to their success. He can play in a traditional big lineup alongside Leonard and center Marc Gasol, or in a smaller one if they go with Serge Ibaka in the middle. The athleticism was always there for the 6-foot-9 forward. But now it\u2019s only part of the package for a player who made one 3-pointer his entire rookie season in 2016-17 and now averages one per game, the easiest place to notice his improvement. \u201cI don\u2019t know who else is even really up for it, who the voting\u2019s between, all that stuff. I know that if anybody\u2019s done more than this kid, has improved more, has impacted the team more and continued to improve from even geez, 20 games ago,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cHe just keeps taking another step forward, there has been no steps back. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly deserving. If there\u2019s somebody else who is deserving, then sometimes that\u2019s the way it works. But he\u2019s had an unbelievable season.\u201d Soon it will be time for the Raptors to show how much they\u2019ve improved along with him. They became postseason punching bags the last couple years who want to show they won\u2019t be pushed around any longer. \u201cWe have a new group so it\u2019s going to be definitely tough and I think we\u2019re more focused on that,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cObviously we think about the playoffs, we\u2019re excited about it, can\u2019t wait for it. We just want to make sure we get the right chemistry and everything going so when that time comes, we\u2019ll be ready to perform.\u201d He got into only two playoff games two years ago, when the native of Cameroon was still learning the game. It was only five years earlier when he had come through the Basketball Without Borders camp in Africa, then headed to Texas for prep school and onto New Mexico State before becoming a late first-round pick. He\u2019s not sure if friends back home are aware of his success. But if he wins the Most Improved Player award, chances are they\u2019ll hear about it. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not a personal-type guy where I care about personal accolades and stuff, but definitely a team-guy first,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cSomething like that, in terms of who I am and the person that I\u2019ve become, and people that know my story and how I came up, that would mean a lot just because that\u2019s me. Like, that\u2019s literally who I am as a player and as a person.\u201d"},{"id":34532,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-cavaliers-arena-being-renamed-rocket-mortgage","date":"2019-04-09","title":"Report: Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena being renamed","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 A person familiar with the decision says Cleveland\u2019s Quicken Loans Arena is being renamed Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

They went about proving it all season long to those who ventured into the Boston Garden and, by season\u2019s end, stood atop the NBA mountain. On April 13, 1986, the Celtics stomped the New Jersey Nets 135-107 to wrap up the best home season in NBA history, going 40-1 in 1985-86. Since then, only one team has matched Boston\u2019s finish: the 2015-16 San Antonio Spurs. The Celtics\u2019 lone home loss came on Dec. 6, 1985, a 121-103 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. Boston\u2019s starting frontline of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish teamed with Bill Walton and Scot Wedman to form a formidable five-man frontcourt rotation that nobody in the NBA could match. In the backcourt were Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge, two big guards who could play harassing defense and provide double-figure scoring while focusing on feeding the front line, with scrappy Jerry Sichting in reserve. The result was a unit that won 67 games. Overall, the Celtics were 50-1 at home that season, amassing a 10-0 run through the 1986 playoffs en route to the NBA title.

The 61-year-old coach juggled a revolving roster, pushed his young team while keeping things fun and focused and had a hand in rookie guard Collin Sexton\u2019s startling development. Drew earned widespread respect from players and peers. However, he might not get another season. On Sunday, Drew said he has had no conversations with Cleveland\u2019s front office about his future, and there\u2019s a strong sense around the team that he will coach his final game Tuesday, when the Cavaliers conclude their season against the Charlotte Hornets, who need to beat Cleveland and Orlando for any chance at the postseason. The Cavaliers\u2019 hopes \u2014 and their four-year streak in the Finals \u2014 ended last July, the moment LeBron James chose Los Angeles for his next act. But while Drew is likely nearing a finish with the Cavs, the appreciation for him remains. \u201cHe did a fantastic job, especially with all the injuries we had, and I wouldn\u2019t say turmoil, but it was tough there at the start,\u201d said star forward Kevin Love, limited to 22 games because of toe surgery and other injuries. \u201cAt the very beginning when he took over, he had us playing extremely hard and I think that carried throughout. \u201cOur attention to detail, our practices, our shootarounds, everything was really dialed in and very professional so I\u2019ve always had LD\u2019s back, always thought very highly of him. I think whether he is here or not next year, he\u2019s going to have a big impact whether it\u2019s on our team or with a different organization. \u201cHe\u2019s 40 years in and he\u2019s still got a lot to give.\u201d Before Sunday\u2019s loss to San Antonio, the Cavaliers\u2019 ninth in a row, dropping them to 19-62, Drew said he has had no discussions about his future with the team and \u201cwe\u2019ve decided to wait until the season is completely over before we discuss that.\u201d The Cavaliers, who went 6-35 on the road this season, will finish with one of the league\u2019s three worst records along with Phoenix and New York and have a 14 percent chance of winning next month\u2019s lottery, where the winning team will have a chance to select Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson. Drew inherited a mess in October when the Cavaliers fired Tyronn Lue, the only coach in the past 54 years to lead a Cleveland team to a championship, after a 0-6 start. Amid the upheaval, Drew made it clear he wanted security and rebuffed the \u201cacting\u201d coach tag, saying he wanted some guarantees. An awkward, nine-day standoff ensued, with the Cavaliers re-negotiating Drew\u2019s contract, giving him a raise with a team option for next season. If the Cavs decide to go in another direction, Drew will receive a buyout payment. Once the contract issue was resolved, Drew went to work and has not slowed. It is not reflected in their record, but the Cavaliers have been mostly competitive despite playing much of the season without Love or Tristan Thompson or J.R. Smith, three key members from the club\u2019s 2016 title team. Sexton worked through a rough start to blossom, and Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson have all improved. It has been challenging, but Drew\u2019s steadying presence has eased the pain. \u201cThe one thing I try to share with all of our players is sometimes we go through things and those things shape us into being who we are today,\u201d Drew said before Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cYou have to take the bitter with the sweet. You have to take the good with the bad. Not always going to be the way you want it, but you have to learn how to deal with tough times, how to deal with rough times, how to deal with adversity. \u201cThose are the things that make you a stronger person. Our guys have done a phenomenal job of maintaining a level of professionalism and going out every night and playing hard. We\u2019re not going to play well every night, but we can play hard every night. Our guys have done that. I applaud them for how they\u2019ve been able to handle it.\u201d"},{"id":34538,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2018-19-week-26","date":"2019-04-08","title":"Power Rankings, Week 26: Warriors remain favorites ... and East remains wide open","content":" Back in October, the Golden State Warriors were the favorites to win their third straight championship. And with just 22 games left to be played in the regular season, the Warriors remain the pick. But not everything has gone as expected over the last six months. The next two months aren\u2019t only about who takes home the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy and the regular season has set us up for what should be a fun four rounds of playoffs. With the Cleveland Cavaliers back in Lotteryville, there will be a new champion in the Eastern Conference. And though there\u2019s been a clear best team in the East this season, any of four contenders could be in The Finals come June. In the Western Conference, the Houston Rockets look like a real threat to the Warriors again. But every West playoff team has the talent to get through a round or two. Before we can get there, there is still some regular-season business to take care of. With two days of games remaining, only one playoff series is locked in. Boston Celtics-Indiana Pacers will be the No. 4-vs.-No. 5 series in the East, and it will start in Boston on Saturday or Sunday. The Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers know what their seeds are (No. 1, 2 and 3, respectively), but don\u2019t know who they\u2019ll be playing this weekend. The Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic are in (giving us at least four new playoff teams this year), and the Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat are playing for the final spot in the East. The Warriors are the No. 1 seed in the West, but everything beyond that is fluid. And here\u2019s a reminder: In each of the last 12 years (from 2007-18), at least one team with home-court advantage has lost a first-round series.

For one player, his next game was the stage he need to pay tribute to the slain rapper. Russell Westbrook became the second player in league history to have 20 or more points, rebounds and assists in a game, finishing with 20 points, 20 rebounds and 21 assists. Wilt Chamberlain was the only other player to accomplish the feat. . Warriors 116, Nuggets 102 \u2014 For all that Denver has accomplished this season, it can claim only one win against the defending champs in the regular season. Golden State sent another message to the upstart Nuggets on Tuesday night, drubbing them behind DeMarcus Cousins and Kevin Durant in a win that helped pave the way for the Warriors to lock up the No. 1 seed later in the week. Bucks 128, Sixers 122 \u2014 In a matchup many are hoping for a replay of in the playoffs, Giannis Antetokounmpo outdueled fellow Kia MVP candidate Joel Embiid, finishing with 45 points and 13 rebounds and leading Milwaukee to a 128-122 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. In doing so, the Bucks clinched the top spot in the conference and the top overall top seed in the upcoming playoffs.. Pacers 108, Pistons 89 \u2014 Indiana has struggled since the All-Star break, going 8-12 heading into this Tuesday matchup. Thanks to Thaddeus Young\u2019s 21 points, the Pacers snapped a 10-game losing streak on the road and won for just the third time in their last 10 games overall. As for Detroit, this was the first loss in a week that saw them go 0-4 at the worst time of the season. Hornets 113, Raptors 111 \u2014 Jeremy Lamb, expect to see your clutch rating rise in \u201cNBA 2K20.\u201d Two weeks after sinking the Raptors with a miraculous buzzer-beater in Toronto, he did so again on Friday with a clutch 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds left. The win proved crucial to Charlotte and it\u2019s hanging-by-a-thread playoff hopes as a critical weekend (and week) loomed. Thunder 123, Pistons 110 \u2014 OKC\u2019s do-it-all guard did it again, locking up a third straight season averaging a triple-double. Russell Westbrook crossed that threshold on Friday against the Pistons, finishing with 19 points, 15 assists and eight rebounds that assured him of that statistical feat. While the Thunder are still trying to figure out their playoff future, this feat no doubt further adds to the standout lore Westbrook has already crafted in the NBA. Bucks 115, Hawks 107 \u2014 For the first time since the 1980-81 season, Milwaukee has a 60-win squad on its hands. While this win wasn\u2019t anything spectacular in and of itself, it was good to see the Bucks accomplish their stated goal of 60 wins while methodically picking apart a lesser opponent. Teams that have designs on a title run do that sort of thing down the stretch of the season all the time. Raptors 117, Heat 109 (OT) \u2014 On a 14-game Sunday, Miami was up first and had much to prove in its chase for a playoff spot. After falling in this game \u2014 and combined with other results that day \u2014 it was in a dire spot as Week 26 of the NBA approached. The road for Dwyane Wade and his \u201c#OneLastDance\u201d campaign to finish with a postseason spot got decidedly tougher with this overtime defeat. Hornets 104, Pistons 91 \u2014 Detroit spent better part of last week celebrating its past title teams from the late 1980s and 2004. They could have used some defense from those squads in this game on Sunday. Kemba Walker lit up the Pistons for 31 points to keep Charlotte\u2019s fading playoff hopes afloat while dealing a serious blow to Detroit\u2019s with this big road win. Nets 108, Pacers 96 \u2014 Fans of the teams out of the playoffs, take heart and look to Brooklyn. This win on Sunday wrapped up a playoff berth for it, capping off a lonnng road back to the postseason for a franchise that was a laughing stock just two or three seasons ago. Behind All-Star D\u2019Angelo Russell, the Nets have something to look forward in mid-April and a brighter future in the months beyond that, too. Magic 116, Celtics 108 \u2014 Much like the Nets, the Magic had been mired in a lengthy playoff-less drought. It was fitting, then, that Orlando\u2019s playoff absence came to an end on the same day Brooklyn\u2019s did. Nikola Vucevic showed why he\u2019s a legit go-to guy in the NBA, powering the Magic to a huge road win that wrapped up the team\u2019s first playoff berth since 2011-12. Rockets 149, Suns 113 \u2014 On a routine night at the office for James Harden (30 points), the Rockets at large took center stage. Houston broke its NBA record by making 27 3-pointers in a 149-113 win over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. Houston has made 26 twice this season with the last time coming Tuesday at Sacramento. Warriors 131, Clippers 104 \u2014 This game proved to be a two-fold memorable moment for the defending champs. First, the Warriors locked up the No. 1 overall seed in the Western Conference behind Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Co. Then, they paid homage to Oracle Arena in what was the regular-season finale for the building Golden State has called home the last 47 seasons. In the weeks, months and years to come, this will go down as one of the top moments of the franchise\u2019s recent golden era. Russell Westbrook (20 points, 8-23 FG, 20 reb, 21 ast, 3 stl in 36 minutes) \u2014 Though Westbrook struggled from the field early, the OKC superstar was dazzling all night as he pulled off a feat that hadn\u2019t been seen since Wilt Chamberlain graced the NBA. His 20-20-20 game was more than just another statistical feat for a player who has racked up dozens of them over the last few seasons. | Watch | Video box score DeMarcus Cousins (28 points, 12-17 FG, 13 reb, 5 ast, 2 stl, 2 blk in 28 minutes) \u2014 Thanks to the play of their big man, the Warriors hardly even noticed Kevin Durant\u2019s ejection from Tuesday\u2019s showdown with Denver. Cousins had his way with Denver and its All-Star center, Nikola Jokic, while giving the Warriors reason for hope (and the rest of the West reason to worry about) of another long playoff run. | Watch | Video box score Trae Young (33 points, 12-18 FG, 7 reb, 12 ast in 32 minutes) \u2014 At this stage of the season, a player will take any advantage they can get when it comes to swaying voters for major NBA awards. That fact continues to drive the Hawks\u2019 rookie guard, who has vaulted himself into Luka Doncic\u2019s atmosphere in the Kia Rookie of the Year chase. Performances like the one he turned in Wednesday against the Sixers may only help his cause further. | Watch | Video box score Giannis Antetokounmpo (45 points, 13-22 FG, 13 reb, 6 ast in 34 minutes) \u2014 The Bucks\u2019 superstar has been nothing short of brilliant, scoring 25 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in 42 games this season. His most recent such performance came on Thursday against a fellow Kia MVP hopeful (Joel Embiid) in a thrilling game the injury-plagued Bucks rallied to win. | Watch | Video box score Kemba Walker (31 points, 11-29 FG, 8 reb, 7 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 One of the telltale signs of a true superstar in the NBA is their ability to lift a team when it needs him to do so most. Walker exemplified that on Sunday night, getting Charlotte past Detroit in a game that, had it lost, could have spelled the end of the Hornets\u2019 fast-fading playoff hopes. | Watch | Video box score D\u2019Angelo Russell (20 points, 7-15 FG, 6 reb, 6 ast in 29 minutes) \u2014 The Nets were in control of their game Sunday against the Pacers, clinching both a victory and a 2019 playoff spot in the process. Russell led a balanced Brooklyn effort, but it was his heart and solid all-around play that put an end to a long playoff drought to give New York a playoff team this season. | Watch | Video box score  Nikola Vucevic (25 points, 12-22 FG, 12 reb, 4 ast, 2 blk in 33 minutes) \u2014 Orlando\u2019s All-Star big man has the numbers to back up his status as such, logging his 60th double-double of 2018-19 in a win Sunday. Now, he will have a chance to prove to those who haven\u2019t been watching just how skilled of a center he is after the Magic locked up a playoff berth (and the Southeast Division title) in Boston. | Watch | Video box score \u201cMan, Kemba made a great pass, and everybody said if I get it, shoot it. I just tried to shoot it with confidence.\u201d \u2014 Hornets guard Jeremy Lamb , on his game-winning shot Friday vs. Toronto \u201cI take it one day at a time. That\u2019s it, man. That\u2019s it.

Nobody knows what I\u2019ve been through in the last six years here, just through all the losing, the struggling, the doubting. It\u2019s been very difficult for me at times. It paid off in a great way, man, just to come in here in this building and beat a great Celtics team and to make it.\u201d \u2014 Magic center Nikola Vucevic , after the team clinched a playoff berth on Sunday \u201cIt means a lot, obviously to exceed expectations for a lot of us in here, to see how far we\u2019ve come. It means a ton. Hopefully, it\u2019s a sign of things to come for this organization.\u201d \u2014 Nets guard Joe Harris , after the team clinched a playoff berth on Sunday \u201cGoing to The Finals, losing in The Finals, getting traded, coming back, injuries this year. I think with all these highs and lows, I\u2019ve seen the best of Cleveland and I\u2019ve seen the best of the fans. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m endearing to them. A lot of people say, `I love our fans.\u2019 I legitimately love our fans.\u201d \u2014 Cavs center Channing Frye , who will retire after season\u2019s end \u201cI\u2019m not saying we want people to score 50 on us, but we want to protect the paint and protect from the shooters. If a guy is able to handle the ball and hit contested shots all night, I just clap my hands. \u2026 I just care if we win.\u201d \u2014 Jazz center Rudy Gobert \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to put it into words but like I said on the floor, that\u2019s who it\u2019s for. I\u2019m going to leave it at that.\u201d \u2014 Thunder guard Russell Westbrook , who dedicated his 20-20-20 game to slain rapper Nipsey Hussle. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t done it earlier because the 14 points a game I averaged was pretty awesome. All 37 fans every game had a hell of a night and really cheered for me. It\u2019s amazing it took so long. \u2026 In all seriousness, anything that has anything to do with the Academy is a thrill and an honor.\u201d \u2014 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich , who will soon be inducted into the Air Force Academy\u2019s athletics hall of fame \u201cJust laughing and joking and catching up \u2026 Everybody\u2019s so interested, especially in LeBron.

He was later joined by Marcus Smart , who suffered a hip contusion in the third quarter. Tatum missed two shots and didn\u2019t score in six minutes before his injury. He is averaging 15.9 points per game in his second season with the Celtics. Smart had six points and four steals in 19 minutes prior to his teammate-assisted exit. He\u2019s averaging 8.9 ppg and 4 apg for Boston, having started most of the season in the backcourt alongside Kyrie Irving. He left with 6:15 remaining in the third, helped off by trainers and holding his left side after banging hips with Magic center Nikola Vucevic. The team initially said it was a left hip contusion. Smart could still be seen limping as he left the arena after the game. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Smart was subsequently diagnosed with a strained oblique and will be re-evalutated in the coming days. In the postgame news conference, coach Brad Stevens corrected that to an oblique \u201cbruise\u201d that he said was less severe than a strain. \u201cMarcus Smart has an oblique bruise, which means he got hit right there,\u201d Stevens said after the game, per the Boston Herald . \u201cAnd so, I guess that\u2019s better than a strain or whatever, but we\u2019ll see what that looks like tomorrow. He was a little sore but was walking around, which was good, in the locker room. So obviously, I\u2019m glad we got out of there without anything else after that.\u201d Stevens also said Tatum might have suffered his injury previously. \u201cTatum had a shin contusion that evidently he had before the game, and I didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut he just said it felt a little off when he jumped, so, you know, hopefully it\u2019s nothing major, but he\u2019ll get checked out tonight and tomorrow and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d After the game, it sounded like Stevens would not be playing Tatum or Smart \u2014 or several other Boston mainstays \u2014 in the team\u2019s regular-season finale Tuesday against the Washington Wizards. \u201cThe point of tonight was to try to \u2014 because we won\u2019t play [a playoff game] \u2019til Saturday, maybe Sunday \u2014 was to get a true game for some of our starters and our top seven or eight guys,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut those guys will play a lot less on Tuesday, if at all.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":34506,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-don-we-believe-throwbacks-oracle-finale","date":"2019-04-08","title":"Warriors don 'We Believe' uniforms for regular-season finale at Oracle","content":" The Golden State Warriors dug back into their history for the final regular-season game at Oracle Arena, donning the red, blue, gold and white throwbacks they wore from 2003-10.

McCollum started against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday after missing the past 10 games to recover from a left knee strain. He finished with nine points, six rebounds and six assists, shooting 3-of-13 (1-for-5 on 3-pointers) in 25 minutes. After the game, McCollum told reporters he is feeling pain-free in his knee, writes Joe Freeman of The Oregonian . \u201cIf there was any pain, I wouldn\u2019t have played,\u201d McCollum said, per the newspaper. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any pain in a long time. \u201cI felt like I was moving pretty well, I felt like my conditioning was in pretty good shape and I just tried to play the game. I was pretty free-flowing with my movement. I felt pretty comfortable \u2026 and just tried to play a normal game.\u201d Getting McCollum back before the playoffs begin will do nothing if not help solidify Portland\u2019s player rotation. That aspect of the team had been in a bit of transition in the aftermath of McCollum\u2019s injury as well as a season-ending injury to starting center Jusuf Nurkic. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really important \u2014 figuring out the rotation so we won\u2019t be going in (to the playoffs) kind of shocked,\u201d Evan Turner said. \u201cHe did well, we won the game and that was big-time.\u201d Said All-Star guard Damian Lillard: \u201cTo get him back and the way we played when he was out, a lot of guys had to step up and do a little bit more. I think the fact that it went well, it gave a lot of guys more confidence.

The Nets and Magic did. And, that simply, two of the NBA\u2019s playoff droughts have come to a close. For the Magic, it\u2019s seven seasons. From the end of the Dwight Howard era on through all kinds of roster experimentation, it was a former assistant who finally, ah \u2026 found the right tricks. And perhaps Steve Clifford\u2019s biggest accomplishment was unlocking two-way, top-of-the-marquee talent from center Nikola Vucevic, who started the season on a tear and never relented. But after a first season with the Philadelphia 76ers, Vucevic would be a Magic lifer courtesy of the massive, four-team trade that sent Howard and the Magic\u2019s playoff run packing. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling. Nobody knows what I\u2019ve been through in the last six years here, just through all the losing, the struggling, the doubting,\u201d Vucevic said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult for me at times. It paid off in a great way, man, just to come in here in this building and beat a great Celtics team and to make it.\u201d It\u2019s entertaining to think this squad will add former No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz, (hopefully) healthy and perhaps the point guard they\u2019ve not been able to hone in on since Jameer Nelson\u2019s run. But first, that postseason though. For the Nets, much like coach Kenny Atkinson\u2019s offense, this was the vision hitting the court a little bit faster than anyone was expecting. When the Nets last made the playoffs, in 2015, it was in there by a hair at 38-44. Brook Lopez was the leading scorer, and quickly downsloping Joe Johnson and Deron Williams in their final pairing as \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Backcourt.\u201d Past-expiration assets were offloaded \u2014 see trades of Kirilenko, Andrei and Garnett, Kevin \u2014 and the full ramifications of The Trade were quickly becoming evident. By the time it all imploded midway through the following year, the GM search spotlighted Sean Marks, with Atkinson\u2019s acquisition soon to follow. And trade by patient trade, player by player developed, the Nets gradually pulled together a combination of cohesiveness that has outperformed any expectation. With D\u2019Angelo Russell given a much-needed new situation and the confidence that comes with a full year of keys, with wily veterans like Jared Dudley coaching up-and-comers like Caris LeVert alongside projects-made- players like Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris, Atkinson and Marks have found a mix that\u2019s set for future success. \u201cIt means a lot, obviously to exceed expectations for a lot of us in here, to see how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt means a ton. Hopefully, it\u2019s a sign of things to come for this organization.\u201d Russell is headed to free agency, and while the Nets have a ton of potential space on their hands, a large chunk seems destined for their star guard. How they spend the rest likely determines how much higher they can climb. Out in Oakland, the Warriors gave the \u201cROARacle\u201d a regular-season farewell, paying tribute to the history of their 47-year run in the building they leave at the end of this campaign. Next fall, they move into the Chase Center , across the bay in San Francisco. But this spring is all about Oracle Arena. The day opened with the Warriors players choosing to honor the \u201cWe Believe\u201d No. 8 seed Warriors, who knocked off the No. 1-seeded Dallas Mavericks in 2007. \u201cThese jerseys hold a special place in Warriors\u2019 fans hearts and this organization and the history of this organization,\u201d Draymond Green said. The festivities continued with appearances by Warriors alumni from every era, a print-out commemorative ticket photo booth, a victory and eventually, a postgame ceremony anchored by coach Steve Kerr. \u201cLet me just say that for 47 years, Warriors fans have stuck with us through thick and thin,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, most of those years have been a little thin.\u201d The organization unveiled a banner that will hang in the Chase Center. The Warriors finished their run at Oracle with 4 championships (3 in the last 4 seasons) and a 1,166-770 record, along with 18 postseason trips to date. One more is forthcoming, and the Warriors enter as the No. 1 seed, favorites to put that fifth championship on the board. Beyond the two clinchers, here are the key takeaways from Sunday\u2019s action: WESTERN CONFERENCE EASTERN CONFERENCE This one\u2019s all in the headline. The ball has been used for ping-pong in Toronto, and the East should worry. Searching for a pair of ankles. Once owned by De\u2019Aaron Fox.

It came just five days after they tied the mark, initially set against the Los Angeles Lakers in January, with 26 against the Sacramento Kings. They now hold the top three single-game performances, and four of the top 10. The Rockets made 27 of 57 attempts from 3, good for 47.4 percent. Seven players hit at least two 3s, including Eric Gordon (8-13), James Harden (5-6) and P.J. Tucker (4-9). Gary Clark tied the record with a little over three minutes to play and Houston missed the next four before Austin Rivers broke it with 1:09 remaining.

When he was promoted, Drew said he didn\u2019t want to be an interim coach and fought the team for a pay raise. He got a new deal, which includes a team option for the 2019-20 season. If the Cavaliers chose not to retain him, Drew will receive a buyout payment."},{"id":34535,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-waive-mbah-moute-official-release","date":"2019-04-07","title":"LA Clippers waive Luc Mbah a Moute","content":" The L.A.

When poet Gertrude Stein years ago uttered her famous line about her hometown \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s no there there\u201d \u2014 perhaps she had this gray patch of pavement specifically in mind. Oh, and yet \u2026 once inside Oracle Arena, there is life and soul. There is strong and loyal support, once again, for Oakland\u2019s basketball team, winners of three of the last four championships. There\u2019s a there here, although not for long. The next time the Warriors play a regular season home game, it will be at their splashy new palace in San Francisco this fall and filled with fans of a different cloth; meanwhile on that same night, Oracle will be filled with crickets and Oakland\u2019s heart with ache. Well: Where do we begin to describe the nearly five decades when the Warriors made Oakland their home and Oakland embraced the Warriors as its own? The days and mostly nights of the unforgettable players and coaches and characters: Run-TMC and KD, Nellie and Sleepy, Spree and Splash? There are still blue and yellow fragments of victory parade confetti floating in Lake Merritt, after all. And now there will be a permanent separation between the team and The Town, which was always inevitable and understandable because money talks, but still. Understand, this isn\u2019t the Colts packing up the Mayflower and sneaking out of Baltimore at night, or the Sonics stolen from Seattle; the Warriors will only be a $5 Bay Bridge toll away ($7 at rush hour). Besides, the Warriors began in San Francisco via Philadelphia in 1962 and so they were on loan to Oakland, so to speak. It\u2019s the biological parents finally showing up at the doorstep after all these years and coming to reclaim the adopted child. And maybe it\u2019s just as well from an identity standpoint. The Warriors are a better fit for San Francisco for what they\u2019ve become: A white collar, glam-franchise jointly owned by a venture capitalist and a Hollywood mogul and observed from courtside seats by latte-sipping Silicon Valley eggheads. Success and economics have priced the Warriors right out of gritty Oakland, where most folks here can\u2019t afford tickets anyway. The new arena is only eight miles in the distance but it might as well be a world away. If nothing else, everyone involved will always reminisce about the shared experience on this side of the Bay, which has enriched the Warriors and their soon-to-be former home for the better. \u201cThis is all I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d said two-time MVP Stephen Curry, who has spent his entire 10-year career with the Warriors and made the East Bay his year-round home, \u201cand it\u2019s been good for me, my family and the team. Oakland has a special place in my heart. An amazing relationship.\u201d Curiously, the Warriors didn\u2019t rush to Oakland when the city built what was then the redundantly-named Coliseum Arena in 1966; they weren\u2019t sold on Oakland until the 1971-72 season. They were coached by the gravelly-voiced Al Attles, who quickly became a local legend for steering the Warriors to the 1975 title and always carrying himself with class and dignity around town. The first superstar in Oakland was Rick Barry, famous for the underhanded free throw and salty demeanor but embraced despite that flaw in Oakland where he played for two pro teams \u2014 the Warriors and briefly the ABA\u2019s Oakland Oaks. In the \u201975 Western Conference finals Game Seven, Barry played poorly, got benched, then bailed out by his teammates to reach the Finals. As time expired in that game and the fans stormed the court, a trainer somehow found and fetched little Jon Barry, now an ESPN broadcaster, then a shaken ballboy who got lost at sea. Here\u2019s a fun fact: Barry and the Warriors then swept the Bullets for their first title in Oakland (they previously won a decade earlier as the Philly Warriors) but the clinching game was played at the Cow Palace in San Francisco because the folks who ran the Coliseum Arena didn\u2019t think the Warriors were title-bound so they booked the Ice Follies featuring Big Bird and Sesame Street. And so, not until the Warriors beat the Cavaliers in 2017 for their third title did Oakland celebrate a championship in-house. Afterward that \u201975 season came a revolving cast of characters, from Sleepy Floyd to Don Nelson and Latrell Sprewell and Chris Webber and of course, the Chris Mullin-Mitch Richmond-Tim Hardaway trio that became the league\u2019s best entertainment value. From a results-standpoint, though, there was a dry spell that would make the Sahara jealous: From 1991 until 2012, the Warriors won exactly one playoff round. At least that one round was deliciously historic; the scrappy \u201cWe Believe\u201d Warriors with Baron Davis upset the 67-win Mavericks to become the first eight-seed to beat a one-seed in a first-round best-of-seven. Yes, the pre-dynasty Warriors were mostly dreadful except for this: Oakland never abandoned them, no matter how bad they were. \u201cThe fans still came out,\u201d said Barry. \u201cThe fans have always been great, loyal, and they got even better once they got a team worthy of the support.\u201d A quirk in the team-fans relationship came a decade ago when the Warriors held Chris Mullin Night and the ceremony was interrupted by boos for Joe Lacob, who had recently purchased the losing team and subsequently approved a trade of popular guard and leading scorer Monta Ellis. Barry grabbed the mic and scolded those fans for being insensitive to Mullin and prematurely judging Lacob. \u201cIt was only a small portion of the people who booed,\u201d said Barry. \u201cIt was Chris\u2019 night, and to take that time to voice your displeasure was not the right thing to do. I told them that we have more class than this, and as far as Joe was concerned, I told them to give this man a chance. As it turned out, trading Monta was a great move on the part of the Warriors.\u201d Trading Ellis allowed the Warriors to give minutes to rookie Klay Thompson and also more responsibility for Curry. It created the Splash Brothers backcourt and a dynasty took root. The rest, you know: Championships in 2015, 2017 and 2018, a near-miss in 2016, and pole position for a fourth ring this summer. The Warriors have popped plenty of shots and corks since the turn of the decade. And this did wonders for the psyche of Oakland, a city that suffers in comparison to its wealthier and more sophisticated neighbor, yet surfed the Warriors\u2019 wave of championships to the mountaintop, high above the fog that forms here. The connection between the Warriors and Oakland was never confined within the concrete walls of Oracle, though. While the locals often wondered why the team name never reflected the home \u2014 \u201cGolden State\u201d seems so impersonal \u2014 and the Warriors only two years ago introduced \u201cThe Town\u201d jerseys featuring the city\u2019s Tree symbol, there\u2019s always been a bond. The practice facility sits atop the Oakland Convention Center, right around the corner from mom and pop stores and blocks from a park where the homeless gather. The players, then and now, aren\u2019t ghosts around town and with few exceptions made their homes in the East Bay. That\u2019s because Oakland and the East Bay (where they can buy homes with big backyards, unlike San Francisco) was always welcoming. Demographically it was a good fit, too; the large African-American makeup of Oakland agreed with a mostly-black league, culturally, socially and politically. The players shop in San Francisco but party in Oakland. And the food choices here, diverse and delivered with love, can rival any city of its size. But it goes even deeper: Oakland is a good and necessary community to serve, and the Warriors, especially in recent years, have stepped up their off-court game to be seen as more than just athletes. The epicenter for this is the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a place where real life meets and often conflicts with fun and games. The Warriors have had a two-decades relationship with the center and the kids who use it, showering the EOYDC with appearances, funding, charity events and clinics.  \u201cOur home is located in the middle of a challenged community,\u201d said Regina Jackson, the long-serving CEO of the center. \u201cThere\u2019 s prostitution , gang violence , homelessness, unemployment and it can be fairly violent. There are things that are not healthy for young people. It is the very reason the center was created 40 years ago. There needed to be a beacon of hope, a north star, a safe place where you can go and get away from some of the negatives of the community. You can come here and be empowered, encouraged and valued. That is the culture that runs through our organization. Sometimes kids come in with traumatic experiences and they don\u2019t trust very much.\u201d Even the most troubled kids can trust a superstar with a smile, which is why Curry will always be worshiped at the center. The Kia Sorrento SUV he won for being named the 2015 MVP was donated to the center, and he caused a stir last year when he made an appearance. Curry arrived in the early morning, no entourage, \u201cjust drove up and walked in the door,\u201d said Jackson. Once there, she asked him to sign in, \u201clike everyone else.\u201d Curry\u2019s response: \u201cAlright Miss Regina.\u201d The kids had no advance notice that the game\u2019s greatest shooter would be their guest \u2014 had that happened, the center would be crammed with mothers and fathers and friends and it would be madness \u2014 yet once he appeared in view, madness ensued anyway. As Jackson recalled, before her staff could spring into action, a commanding voice took over, a voice belonging to Curry, who asked everyone to calm down and he\u2019d have time for them. And quickly, order was restored. You know how hard it is to get kids to sit still and listen? That was more impressive than hitting three-pointers from half-court. That day Curry handed out water (\u201clike a ballboy,\u201d said Jackson) and mingled and it seemed so natural for him and special for the center. \u201cHe has a presence,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cWhen his presence enters the room there\u2019s an energy that can be telekinetic, like energy that pops up on a heart monitor. He always seems to be surprised by the reaction when he walks into a room, as if kids aren\u2019t supposed to be excited. And that speaks to his humility and transparent nature and foundation of being a regular guy.\u201d But it\u2019s not just Curry; a number of Warriors have beaten a path to the EOYDC and other community centers over the years: Hardaway, Chris Webber, DeMarcus Cousins, Draymond Green, etc., etc. Durant sponsored a bus to be used by the championship basketball teams from a pair of Oakland high schools in the Warriors\u2019 victory parade and they rode in the same caravan as the Warriors. \u201cWith this group, their niche is about being fairly accessible,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou know, when these organized appearances happen, it starts out as a team thing but then it is up to the individual player to be convicted toward why they\u2019re going and what they\u2019re doing. You can feel when somebody doesn\u2019t want to be here, but we\u2019ve never felt that vibe from the Warriors. The way they play on the court is the way they play off the court.\u201d And now what? Something will be lost when the Warriors boomerang back to San Francisco. How can Curry replicate those pregame shots he takes from the mouth of the tunnel at Oracle? Will someone punch a hole in the wall near the visitor\u2019s locker room, as Dirk Nowitzki did following the Dallas loss to the \u201cWe Believe\u201d Warriors? What will be the climate created by the buttoned-up San Francisco crowd? Regina Jackson, who\u2019s lived in Oakland for 50 years, speaks for many in town regarding the move, with a sigh of resignation. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m happy because I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you end up saying to yourself is we were really lucky that this happened in our lifetimes. A lot of our young people got to go to their first game, tour the facility, be on the Jumbotron. But we had a very close relationship with this team that was not just going to the games. These are lifetime experiences. While the Warriors have maintained they\u2019re going to continue an Oakland presence, it won\u2019t be the same. We can\u2019t roll down the street and make it to Oracle anymore.\u201d Everyone leaves with a parting gift, a favorite memory. Steve Kerr\u2019s is beating the Rockets in Game 5 of the Western finals in 2015 which put the Warriors in the championship round. \u201cThere was about a minute left and we were up 12 or something so it was kind of apparent that the game was over, and just soaking in the emotion from everybody,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI stood at halfcourt and just kind of scanned the whole building. My goosebumps were everywhere. \u2018Just wow, this is really happening.\u2019 I remembered coming in here many times as a player and as a broadcaster, where you know, \u2018The Warriors aren\u2019t going to the Finals, right? That\u2019s not happening.\u2019 \u201d A new arena awaits across the Bay, worth north of $1 billion, constructed with technology and the well-heeled in mind. The Warriors have traded up. The Chase Center will be high on the wow factor and low on discomfort. Those who\u2019ve taken a tour of the construction site usually come away envisioning something amazing. \u201cIt\u2019s got a great location, all the bells and whistles,\u201d said Barry. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tremendous because the Warriors are going back to their roots. But bittersweet.\u201d The new building will import the championship banners and raise them high although those will merely be cloth on hangers. Yes, the banners will symbolize what the Warriors did. But what about how everyone felt when the Warriors did it? That energy cannot and will not make it across the bridge. That will remain right where it happened, in Oakland. Which means, there will always be a there there. Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Make that seven. With a total team effort, the Nets defeated the Bucks 133-128 to improve their positioning in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Nets did catch a break when Giannis Antetokounmpo was ruled out due to a left calf injury. Brooklyn made 19 3-pointers and had eight players score in double figures. D\u2019Angelo Russell finished with 25 points and 10 assists, Caris LeVert added 24 off the bench on just 12 shots, and veteran Jared Dudley turned in his most impressive game of the season. Dudley scored 14 of his 16 points in the second half and grabbed a season-high seven rebounds, including a key offensive rebound in the final minute to help Brooklyn hold on. \u201cJD is the ultimate veteran guy from a leadership standpoint,\u201d teammate Joe Harris said after the game. \u201cHe\u2019s like having another coach on the floor.\u201d The Nets moved into sixth place in the East. Orlando also is 40-40, and Detroit is a half-game back with a 39-40 record. Brooklyn owns tiebreakers over both teams. The Nets also are 1.5 games ahead of the ninth-place Miami Heat, who will visit Barclays Center in the regular-season finale on Wednesday. The Nets will play at Indiana on Sunday. Asked how he will prepare for a tough road game against the Pacers, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson had an interesting answer. \u201cI prepare tonight by having a glass of wine,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSometimes you have to celebrate. \u201cThen I wake up tomorrow morning, get my workout in and I\u2019ll be ready for Indiana.\u201d Joel Embiid dominated inside, JJ Redick supplied the outside touch and the 76ers moved closer to securing the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 116-96 victory over the Chicago Bulls. Philadelphia increased its lead over idle Boston to two games and reached the 50-win plateau for second year in a row. That last time the 76ers posted consecutive 50-win seasons was during an impressive run of seven straight 50-win seasons (1979-80 through 1985-86) in the Julius Erving era. Here\u2019s the best dunk from Saturday night (courtesy of Joel Embiid) along with the best house call we could find from Dr. J during the aforementioned era: Hours before playing the first Final Four game in school history, the Auburn Tigers were visited by their most famous basketball alumnus. Charles Barkley addressed the team inside the Auburn locker room before the Tigers played Virginia. \u201cSeize this opportunity because it don\u2019t come along that often,\u201d Barkley said. The Tigers started slow but came alive in the closing minutes, turning a 10-point deficit into a 61-57 lead with 19.3 seconds left. Auburn led by two points with two seconds remaining, but a controversial foul call on a 3-point attempt allowed the Cavaliers to pull out a dramatic 63-62 victory.

In addition to the champion\u2019s showing, there were other things that caught our eye during 2018-19: Lou Williams\u2019 emergence, Dwyane Wade\u2019s solid second half and Marc Gasol\u2019s slippage. As we look toward next season, it\u2019s going to be hard for anyone to stop the King\u2019s quest for a three-peat. Maybe Stephen Curry? That\u2019ll be very tough since he turns 32 next March. Here\u2019s a quick look at all the OSPR champions: Pau Gasol ( 2015-16 ), Dwyane Wade ( 2016-17 ), LeBron James ( 2017-18 ), LeBron James (2018-19). 1. LeBron James (34), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 4 games, 26.0 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 12.0 apg Season stats: 27.4 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 8.3 apg Whether at 33 or 34 (his birthday was December 30), LeBron didn\u2019t miss a beat, injuries notwithstanding. His 27.4 ppg were in line with last season\u2019s (27.5) and represented his highest mark since 2009-10, when he went for 29.7. We also took notice that this was the fourth straight season in which he shot better than 50 percent from the field (51.0 FG%). Is anyone going to bet against a three-peat from Mr. James? 2. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 6 games, 18.8 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 5.8 apg Season stats: 20.2 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 5.3 apg Williams closed out strong, notching six straight games of 14 or more points. He also managed 20 or more in four of the last nine and seven or more assists in three of the last five. This also makes two consecutive seasons in which Williams averaged more than 20 points per game while matching a career high with 5.3 assists. We also can\u2019t fail to mention he secured his first career triple-double in 2018-19. 3. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 3 Latest stats:  7 games, 21.6 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 2.7 apg Season stats: 21.2 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 2.4 apg Despite a monster 48-point, 13-rebound game on March 24 against Boston, Aldridge didn\u2019t have quite enough juice to overtake Williams at No. 2. He did chip in another solid showing (27 points and 18 rebounds on Sunday), but we couldn\u2019t look beyond the 10-point effort at the start of the stint and a 14-point on 6-for-15 shooting game last Thursday against the Cavaliers. 4. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 7 games, 16.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.7 apg Season stats: 15.7 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 8.1 apg Yes, the shooting was a bit ugly (41.2 FG%), but Paul did so many other things that it was hard not to move him up. He had two games of 20 or more points, two games with 12 or more assists and another two games with 18 or more points. In addition, Paul snatched two or more steals in three of seven. Next preseason could see Paul in the top three \u2026 if he can stay healthy. 5. Dwyane Wade (36), Miami Heat Previous rank: 7 Latest stats: 7 games, 16.4 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 4.4 apg Season stats: 14.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 4.1 apg Like Paul, the shooting definitely left something to be desired (42.3 FG%), but Wade did enough in his seven games to warrant a bump into the top five. In addition to scoring 17 in two straight, Wade eclipsed the 20-point barrier two more times. He\u2019s now gone 14 straight games with double-figure scoring, a nice finishing kick from the future Hall of Famer. 6. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 6 games, 10.0 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 5.5 apg Season stats: 14.4 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 8.7 apg We\u2019re sensing a theme here between Paul, Wade and Lowry. You guessed it \u2014 bad shooting. Lowry was low man on the totem pole with a 37.3 FG% clip over the last six games. He did, however, manage to dish out six or more assists and score in double figures in four of six. In addition, Lowry had nine steals over a three-game stretch. 7. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 8 Latest stats: 7 games, 20.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.6 apg Season stats: 18.0 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.7 apg No more of the poor shooting, as Redick went for a more-than-respectable 46.5 FG% and 40.0 3PT%. In fact, his last three games may have been one of his better stretches all season, going for 26, 30 and 29 while connecting on 15-for-33 3-pointers. It looked like Redick would slip after starting the stint with 14 and eight, but he rebounded quite nicely over the next five. 8. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Previous rank: 9 Latest stats: 4 games, 19.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 5.3 apg Season stats: 13.6 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 4.2 apg You gotta move up a notch when you secure your first triple-double of the season (and second of career), right? Of course you do. Horford has been sizzling of late, pouring in 19 or more points in six straight while shooting a blistering 59.3 FG% over the last four. He\u2019s been trending in the right direction: 13.1 points in January, 14.5 in February, 15.3 in March and 20.0 in April. 9. Goran Dragic (32), Miami Heat Previous rank: 10 Latest stats: 7 games, 12.1 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 5.7 apg Season stats: 14.5 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 4.6 apg Like Horford, Dragic moves up a tick on the strength of his first triple-double of the season, and first since 2010-11. In addition to the triple-double, Dragic torched the Celtics for 30 (12-for-20 shooting) last Monday. But outside those two games, it was rough sailing for the point guard, who shot just 35.6 FG% and 21.9 3PT% over the seven games. 10. Paul Millsap (34), Denver Nuggets Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 8 games, 9.1 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.5 apg Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2.0 apg You\u2019re going to take a big tumble whenever you shoot just 33.8 FG% over an eight-game stretch. We gave real consideration to bumping Millsap from the top 10, but none of the names below did enough to warrant it. In his last eight, Millsap went for double-figure scoring just four times, failing to eclipse 14 in those contests. He did, however, manage to turn in two double-doubles.

It comes three days after Westbrook registered another historic triple-double feat , putting up 20 points, 20 rebounds and 21 assists in a victory over the Lakers to join Wilt Chamberlain with the only 20-20-20 lines in league annals. Westbrook\u2019s three straight triple-double seasons are an unprecedented achievement, with Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson accounting for the only other comparable campaign in NBA history, back in 1961-62. Westbrook was arguably the story of the 2016-17 season, winning the Kia MVP as he matched Robertson with his first triple-double season. Westbrook\u2019s relentless pace has continued despite considerably less fanfare over the ensuing two seasons. His 98 individual triple-doubles are more than any NBA player over a three-year period, pushing his overall total of 135 to third on the career list, trailing only Magic Johnson (138) and Robertson (181).

Athletic director Malcolm Turner announced the hiring Friday. Stackhouse will need to revive a program that just went through its worst season ever at 9-23. The Commodores finished on a 20-game skid and became the first Southeastern Conference team to go winless in league play in 65 years. And two of the team\u2019s most highly recruited players are both leaving early for the NBA. Stackhouse will be introduced at a news conference Monday, and Turner said in a statement that the future is bright for the Commodores with their new coach. \u201cJerry brings a unique mix of experience as a legendary player and successful coach, and I fully expect he\u2019ll take the program to new heights,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with people inside and outside both college and professional basketball, and there is unanimous agreement that Jerry\u2019s competitiveness, grit and tireless focus on player development are a perfect fit to advance the `Vanderbilt Way\u2019 in college athletics.\u201d Stackhouse succeeds Bryce Drew, who was fired March 22 after he went 40-59 in three seasons. He takes over a program that plays in the SEC\u2019s oldest basketball arena at Memorial Gym, and the Commodores\u2019 history includes three Southeastern Conference regular season titles, two conference tournament titles \u2013 the last in 2012 \u2013 and 15 NCAA Tournament appearances. He said he\u2019s looking forward to building on the program\u2019s history and thanked Turner and Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos for giving him this opportunity. \u201cI look forward to furthering Vanderbilt\u2019s unique approach to athletics \u2013 blending a powerhouse competitive spirit with elite academics to holistically develop talented student-athletes and celebrate victories on and off the court,\u201d Stackhouse said in a statement. Stackhouse, an 18-year NBA veteran and two-time All-Star, was considered in NBA coaching searches last year by Toronto, New York, Charlotte and Orlando after his success coaching the Raptors\u2019 NBA G League team. Stackhouse was an assistant with Toronto during the 2015-16 season. Then he went 70-30 in two seasons with the Raptors 905, reaching the finals twice and winning a championship. He was the league\u2019s coach of the year for 2016-17 when Turner was president of the G League. Zeppos said Stackhouse\u2019s career speaks for itself and embodies Vanderbilt\u2019s commitment to excellence. \u201cJerry is a true competitor who will carry on Vanderbilt\u2019s legacy of comprehensively developing student-athletes to excel in everything they do \u2013 on the court, in the classroom, and in their lives. I am thrilled to welcome him to Vanderbilt,\u201d Zeppos said. Stackhouse is the first black head coach for men\u2019s basketball at Vanderbilt. The school becomes the only Power Five program with a black athletic director, football coach (Derek Mason) and men\u2019s basketball coach. The Commodores last reached the NCAA Tournament in 2017 in Drew\u2019s first season after being hired in April 2016 to replace Kevin Stallings. Drew\u2019s worst season came after signing the highest-rated recruiting class ever at Vanderbilt. Five-star point guard Darius Garland hurt his knee Nov. 23 in a home loss to Kent State and later withdrew to prepare for the NBA draft. Simisola Shittu, Drew\u2019s other five-star recruit, announced Wednesday that he was entering the NBA draft also.

Now imagine not dropping it out of sheer anxiety and nervousness over the experience. The best approach would be squeeze that cash tightly in your fist and run like a thief. But that\u2019s not an option, because it\u2019s not your money. It belongs to NBA players or their teams, to be paid out \u2014 or not \u2014 in \u201csupermax\u201d contracts that will swing on the votes of media members for the league\u2019s annual postseason awards . Players such as Karl-Anthony Towns, Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Klay Thompson and others could land or miss out on massive sums of money based on balloting for All-NBA teams or other honors such as Kia NBA MVP or Kia Defensive Player of the Year. What I hold in my hand is in fact my wireless mouse, with which I will cast votes by the middle of next week that theoretically could cost a player \u2014 and his agent, his wife, his kids, his grandkids, his charities and yeah, the IRS and state Department of Revenue \u2014 the sort of money that lasts and transforms generations. Or a single vote for this guy rather than that guy could limit a team\u2019s ability to compete in free agency, send a franchise into the luxury tax or otherwise impact the competition I cover in a way that is far from ideal. Voting in a national election is way more significant and can have a far greater impact in blood and treasure. But you have lots more cover there \u2014 130 million or so fellow voters \u2014 than the 100 media peeps who annually determine the NBA\u2019s winners, losers, ranked and unranked. Consider Towns, who signed a super-max extension right before training camp in September. His deal to stick with the Minnesota Timberwolves through the 2023-24 season, on paper, is worth $158 million, starting at $27.2 million in 2019-20 and ending at $36 million in its final season. But Towns\u2019 deal could balloon by that extra $32 million if he qualifies for 30 percent of Minnesota\u2019s salary cap. That\u2019s a provision of what came to be known as the \u201cRose rule,\u201d written into the Collective Bargaining Agreement to accommodate players such as Derrick Rose. In 2010-11, he won Kia MVP honors while still playing on his rookie contract, becoming the youngest player in league history to get the award. Having the sort of dominant season that earns a fellow the MVP is one thing. But being picked as the NBA\u2019s third -best center or sixth -best guard? That\u2019s a relative trifle, swinging on a vote cast in the relative shadows. Not to go all nefarious here, but the math is indisputable: Towns could send every one of the 100 media voters a $100,000 check for, you know, their \u201cconsideration.\u201d And he\u2019d still net an extra $22 million if their votes pushed him across the line, triggering the bigger bucks. But we\u2019re not even talking about bribery or integrity. Media voters historically have demonstrated plenty of the latter, even when broadcasters paid by the 30 teams participated. You\u2019d see occasional \u201chomer\u201d votes cast, but those typically canceled each other out. No, what makes the current system, linked to contract amounts, so potentially irksome is that people whose job descriptions require they have a zero rooting interest in teams wind up smack in the middle of a team\u2019s finances. And this is while risking professional relationships with the people involved from both sides. The players, their reps, their families and their friends eventually find out, via the NBA\u2019s commitment to transparency in posting voters\u2019 selections. So do the general managers, team presidents, coaches and owners. And still, the worst of it is people with little or no expertise in sports management or even basketball (as we\u2019re often reminded) are air-dropped into the middle of a franchise\u2019s business. A professional arbitrator? An academician hired for a moonlighting gig in his or her spare time? Some former GM agreed to by both sides to render judgment on such an enormous bonus? Any of those would be preferable to flipping the keys to a global group of busy and highly fallible scribblers and yakkers. Media folks generally have shown themselves to be reliable in selecting NBA honors and awards, at least in a \u201cdemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others\u201d way. Voting by players, coaches, executives and fans is far more blatant in its partisanship and rooting interests. But we aren\u2019t qualified to negotiate contracts. Or, at least, we are positioned specifically not to do such a thing. That\u2019s why a number of veteran NBA writers and broadcasters have opted out of the process altogether \u2014 or had their bosses prohibit them from participating. Those of us who do, by filling out the fringe parts of our ballots, in effect will be deciding whether Towns\u2019 gaudy second-half stats, Beal\u2019s post-John Wall performances or Walker\u2019s surge toward a playoff berth merit big monetary rewards. Compared to deserving, excellent players whose All-NBA fates \u2014 but not fortunes \u2014 similarly are in our hands. The momentary sense of power and influence \u2013 $32 million, whoa \u2013 may provide a tiny rush. But it\u2019s an awkward way to vote and it\u2019s a silly way to conduct business. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They\u2019ve turned in unbelievable performances so often that the individual brilliance for both frontrunners for this season\u2019s Kia NBA MVP has become a bit of a blur. They\u2019ve piled up historic stat lines and outlandish scoring nights while adding in superstar efforts in the biggest moments, all of which are requisite for anyone chasing the league\u2019s most prestigious individual honor. They\u2019ve even saved some of their very best stuff for the end of the regular season. Antetokounmpo was at his Greek Freak-iest in a huge win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night , a win that clinched the league\u2019s best overall record for his Milwaukee Bucks. Harden turned in yet another 50-point triple-double, the fifth of his career, in Saturday\u2019s win against the Sacramento Kings and has his Houston Rockets rolling as the playoffs near. All these exclamation points matter. Surely, they\u2019ve been tremendously helpful for anyone wrestling with their voting decision down to the deadline. And yet, for all of the work they\u2019ve put in this season, the ultimate decision on who will walk away with the Maurice Podoloff Trophy is in the hands of the voters ( both the fans and the media panel, which will be revealed later). Essentially, it\u2019s on all of us to decide whose body of work wins out in one of the tightest MVP races ever. And with the final week of the season upon us, this remains an extremely difficult choice to make for many. Is there one factor that weighs heaviest in your evaluation of what separates the MVP in your mind? I doubt it\u2019s that simple for anyone. Trying to boil this debate we\u2019ve been having all season down to just one factor \u2026 there\u2019s just no way. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats :  27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.3 blocks Giannis can go ahead and rest a little bit now. He earned a momentary breather with a wicked performance Thursday night in Philadelphia, outplaying Sixers center Joel Embiid . That victory gave the Bucks the NBA\u2019s best overall record and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. Antetokounmpo did it in a showdown game in a hostile environment with the Bucks still reeling from injuries to Malcolm Brogdon and Nikola Mirotic. Oh, and he did it essentially without point guard Eric Bledsoe, who went to the showers three minutes into the game after drawing two quick technicals for his dust-up with Embiid . None of it slowed Antetokounmpo down as he worked the Sixers for 45 points, 13 rebonds, six assists and five blocks (one a monster swat on Embiid late) in 35 carefully controlled minutes. The Sixers were extra physical with \u201cThe Greek Freak,\u201d doing their best to crowd him to limit his effectiveness. None of it worked. Antetokounmpo zoned in on making sure the Bucks left the building with the prize they\u2019ve worked all season to attain. Last week:  No. 2 Season stat s :  36.5 points, 7.5 assists, 6.5 rebounds, 2.1 steals Harden and the Rockets have been so good of late \u2014 an NBA-best 18-4 since Feb. 18 \u2014 that you could almost forget the dismal start to 2018-19 they rebounded from. No one has been better or more important to the revival effort than Harden, who continues to make it look easy. He needed just 15 shots for his latest 30-point effort , served up in Wednesday\u2019s rout on the road of the LA Clippers. The Rockets have been talking for weeks now about the collective confidence they believe will fuel a playoff run like last season\u2019s. Harden and his crew are not done this season, though. They showed that in rocking the Clippers (who could wind up being Houston\u2019s first-round foe). How Harden and Chris Paul unloaded (a combined 61 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds) on a red-hot Clippers team could prove effective should they meet again in a week or so. Harden\u2019s improved defense and leadership has been evident this season. And he and Paul are in a groove right now that could change the tenor of the playoff chase if they can keep it up. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats :  28.0 points 8.1 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 2.2 steals The Thunder finally got off the schneid with Tuesday\u2019s win against the Los Angeles Lakers , a much-needed win after losses in three of four prior to Russell Westbrook\u2019s historic 20-20-20 game . George provided the ideal complement to Westbrook\u2019s inspired effort against the Lakers, finishing with 19 points, six rebounds, five assists and five steals. It\u2019s the sixth time this season he\u2019s collected five or more steals in a game . George\u2019s work on the defensive end, which could very well land him in the thick of things in the Kia Defensive Player of the Year balloting, has helped shape the finest season of his career. It\u2019s a huge component in the comprehensive improvement he said ( on the latest Hang Time Podcast ) that he locked in on during the offseason. With coach Billy Donovan\u2019s announcement that Andre Roberson\u2019s is unlikely to return anytime soon , George\u2019s defensive prowess might come into focus in the playoffs, too. Both he and Westbrook must tote a greater load now in the absence of the team\u2019s defensive specialist. It\u2019s work George is clearly built for. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats :  27.4 points, 5.4 assists, 5.3 rebounds, 1.4 steals Curry only played 29 minutes in the Warriors\u2019 rout of the Lakers last night , his third straight game with somewhat limited minutes. Whether it\u2019s by design or just circumstance, Warriors coach Steve Kerr is doing the right thing to manipulate the minutes for his superstar. That Curry enters the playoffs healthy and focused is far more important than anything he\u2019ll do in the remaining regular-season games. Even in limited minutes, Curry always finds a way to drop jaws (see his insane, behind-the-back pass to Kevin Durant ). The Warriors still have business to handle in the conference standings. Securing the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference is reason enough for Curry and the Warriors\u2019 stars to run through the regular season tape. But by no means do they need to push it with the prospect of a fifth straight run to The Finals afoot. As presumptuous as that sounds for any team to look that far down the road, it\u2019s an appropriate posture for Curry and the Warriors. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats :  27.6 points, 13.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.9 blocks Embiid turned in a spectacular 34-point, 13-rebound, 13-assist triple-double against the Milwaukee Bucks last night. He also scored perhaps his biggest blow just three minutes into that game, when Bucks point guard Eric Bledsoe got two technical fouls and was ejected after a scuffle with Embiid . But things didn\u2019t go as well for Embiid when he matched up with someone his own size (or as close to it as possible). In a duel of Kia MVP candidates, Embiid\u2019s cardio wasn\u2019t up to standard with the relentless Antetokounmpo. Embiid\u2019s penchant on offense for drifting out to the 3-point line negated his impact around the basket, repeatedly playing right into the hands of the Bucks throughout the game. With all that said, Embiid had his moments where looked every bit like the most dominant force on the floor. Truth be told, that\u2019s where Embiid\u2019s greatest room for individual improvement will come from now, this postseason and beyond. Embiid\u2019s so good already (don\u2019t believe it? Then just ask him.) that he must be careful to not get too comfortable dabbling in his perimeter game at the expense of his around-the-rim game. * * * 6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 7.

That\u2019s a good thing, as voters and NBA observers in general still seem divided between Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden with less than a week remaining in the regular season. The Greek Freak punctuated his own campaign in Milwaukee\u2019s nationally televised 128-122 win over Philadelphia. To the big-picture purists, Antetokounmpo\u2019s 45 points , 13 rebounds, six assists and five blocks were symbolic of the Bucks clinching the No. 1 overall seed in the 2019 playoffs. He is officially the best player on the league\u2019s best team, a definition many feel goes hand-in-hand with the Maurice Podoloff Trophy. Zoom in, and Antetokounmpo\u2019s case can be captured in one sequence against his rival unicorn. On one end, the Bucks superstar bullies Joel Embiid in the paint: The very next possession, Antetokounmpo meets and mutilates an Embiid dunk attempt: This is apex superstar stuff: a collision of 25-and-under superstars (hopefully) destined to clash in power struggles for years to come. Antetokounmpo owned Embiid all night while rallying his suddenly shorthanded team in the final minutes. Giannis all but clinched the outcome by blocking Embiid again, this time with a merciless swat of Embiid\u2019s normally unstoppable spin move. Thursday\u2019s image of Antetokounmpo is one voters will have a hard time forgetting \u2014 unless Harden produces yet another historic performance of his own over Houston\u2019s final three games. And therein lies the danger to Antetokounmpo\u2019s MVP run. The Rockets, who lead fourth-place Portland by just half a game, need the final week of the regular season. The Bucks, who have first place all sewn up, do not. Houston could very well require Harden\u2019s Herculean efforts to finish the season on their teams. Milwaukee will be sorely tempted to rest their own superstar in preparation for the playoffs. If that\u2019s the case, will the image of Antetokounmpo willing Milwaukee over the contending Sixers be enough? His supporters can only hope so. As for Giannis, whatever doubts he may have had concerning himself were banished when Kobe Bryant challenged him on Twitter nearly two years ago. \u201cHe made me believe it even more,\u201d Antetokounmpo admitted after the game. \u201cA guy like Kobe saying \u2018go get the MVP\u2019 made me change my mentality and believe it even more that I can do it. As a team, the Lakers had little more than lottery balls on the line against the Warriors. Yet with L.A. clearly disappointed by this season\u2019s outcome, the search is already on for how to better equip LeBron James with a better supporting cast for 2019-20. The front office might want to look at retaining Alex Caruso full-time. The former G League standout is shooting 51.4 percent from 3-point range \u2014 a tantalizing trickle for a team dying of thirst from beyond the arc all season. Apparently, Caruso can also do this: If the pure burst of hustle and athleticism wasn\u2019t enough to convince the Lakers that Caruso is worth more than meaningless end-season minutes, perhaps James\u2019 reaction will help: When talent and skill meet instinct and opportunity, magic happens: Then again, we might be making too big a deal out of what has become routine for Stephen Curry\u2019s teammates. \u201cHe\u2019s had some better passes than that one,\u201d Kevin Durant corrected reporters after the game. \u201cThat was a great pass. That was a good look, but that\u2019s normal for him.\u201d"},{"id":34561,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-new-orleans-pelicans-begin-interviews-gm-post","date":"2019-04-05","title":"Report: Pelicans begin interviews for GM post","content":" NEW ORLEANS \u2014 The New Orleans Pelicans began interviewing candidates to become the club\u2019s new general manager on Thursday, a person familiar with the process said. The list of candidates includes current Pelicans interim general manager Danny Ferry, as well as former Cleveland Cavaliers general manager David Griffin, Golden State assistant GM Larry Harris, Brooklyn Nets assistant GM Trajan Langon, Houston Rockets assistant GM Gersson Rosas and interim Washington president of basketball operations Tommy Sheppard, the person told The Associated Press . The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the club has not announced any candidates to fill the job that opened when ninth-year GM Dell Demps was fired amid the fallout from All-Star Anthony Davis\u2019 trade request. New Orleans\u2019 next GM is expected to oversee a Davis trade \u2014 which could take place as early as this offseason \u2014 that has the potential to set the course of the franchise for years to come. That person also could decide the fate of coach Alvin Gentry. The Pelicans\u2019 record is 32-47, and they will miss the playoffs for the third time in four years. Ferry, who was serving as a Pelicans front office consultant the past three seasons, was tapped to fill in for Demps for at least the rest of this season. The 52-year-old has been a general manager twice before with Cleveland and Atlanta. He also worked in San Antonio\u2019s front office. He built a playoff team in Atlanta, but was bought out in 2015 amid controversy when a recording of him speaking derisively about a player\u2019s African ancestry was made public. Ferry, a former Duke and NBA player, has maintained he was reading from someone else\u2019s scouting report when the recording was made. Griffin, 45, was the Cavaliers GM from 2014 to 2017, during which LeBron James returned from Miami to Cleveland and the Cavs won an NBA title. But his contract was not renewed after the 2016-17 season and James joined the Los Angele Lakers in free agency a year later. Harris, 56, spent nearly two decades with Milwaukee\u2019s front office, starting in scouting and working his way up to general manager from 2003 to 2007. He has been with the Warriors since 2008. Langdon is a former Duke and NBA player who also played professionally in Europe. The 42-year-old has served as Nets assistant GM since 2016 and has helped rebuild Brooklyn into a squad that entered Thursday\u2019s games on the cusp of qualifying for the Eastern Conference playoffs. Rosas, a native of Colombia, has more than a decade of NBA front office experience, primarily with the Houston Rockets and also has worked with USA Basketball as an international player scout. Sheppard stepped into his current interim post this week after the Wizards\u2019 fired Ernie Grunfeld, and it is unclear how the 50-year-old\u2019s potential for advancement with his current team could affect his interest in joining the Pelicans."},{"id":34536,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-fined-obscene-gesture-official-release","date":"2019-04-04","title":"Pelicans' Davis fined $15K for obscene gesture","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans forward\/center Anthony Davis has been fined $15,000 for directing an obscene gesture toward a fan, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

We finish with the Kia Most Valuable Player Award. This isn\u2019t a case for or against any particular player. It\u2019s just a dive into some of the relevant numbers for consideration. The Antetokounmpo\/Harden debate is fascinating, and there\u2019s probably no wrong answer. Both Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden are the primary drivers of their teams\u2019 success. The case for Harden begins with usage, that he has carried such a large load for the No. 2 offense in the league . The case for Antetokounmpo begins with the standings, and that he the role he has played in the Milwaukee Bucks being just the third team in the last *23 years to rank in the top three on both ends of the floor. * 23 years (since the 1996-97 season) is the timeframe for which we have play-by-play and shot location data. The other two teams that have ranked in the top three in both offensive and defensive efficiency are the 2014-15 Warriors and the 2016-17 Warriors. * * * More articles from this series: The discussion can be started in the boxscore, with the reigning MVP leading all players in points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks per game\u2026 Harden also leads the league in usage rate . In fact, his usage rate of 39.6 perent is the second highest in the last 23 years. When Russell Westbrook had a 40.0 percent usage rate two seasons ago, his team ranked 15th in offensive efficiency . Harden has the second highest usage rate of the last 23 years for a team that ranks second offensively . He (both this season and last season) and Carmelo Anthony (in 2012-13) are the only players with one of the 20 highest usage rates of the last 23 years for offenses that ranked in the top five that season. Harden has the second highest true shooting percentage among the group, only topped by James Harden (last season). And the third highest mark among the group (Dwyane Wade in 2008-09) isn\u2019t really close. Among the 35 players with a usage rate of 25 percent or higher this season, Harden ranks sixth in true shooting percentage . Here are the true shooting percentage leaders among the 172 players with at least 500 field goal attempts . Through Wednesday, the true shooting percentage marks for Stephen Curry (64.2 percent) and Antetokounmpo (64.1 percent) would rank 15th and 16th all-time among players with at least 1,000 field goal attempts in a single season. The highest is Curry\u2019s mark of 66.9 percent in 2015-16 . The two MVP frontrunners can each be turnover-prone. Among the 35 players with a usage rate of 25 percent or higher, Antetokounmpo (1.55) and Harden (1.51) rank 24th and 26th, respectively, in assist\/turnover ratio . The leaders in assists points created per game are similar to the leaders in assists per game , though a player is a little higher on the list if his team takes a lot of 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo (242) has more assists on threes than Harden (212). But Harden has more than twice as many assists on dunks and layups (323) than Antetokounmpo (131). In fact, 57 percent of Harden\u2019s assists have come on buckets in the restricted area. That\u2019s the third highest rate among 42 players with at least 300 total assists. Of course, one of the two higher rates (58 percent) belongs to Khris Middleton, because he gets to assist Antetokounmpo, who has scored 16.0 points per game in the restricted area , the most for any player in the 23 years for which we have shot location data. Steals and blocks aren\u2019t everything on defense, though you will find every likely candidate for Defensive Player of the Year in the top 20 in steals + blocks per game .

On a per-possession basis, he ranks third (among players who have averaged at least 20 minutes in 50 games or more) , behind Danny Green (plus-13.1) and Curry (plus-13.1), with the Bucks having outscored their opponents by 12.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor.

The last unanimous winner was the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 Karl-Anthony Towns , who in 2016 became the fifth runaway winner, joining the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Damian Lillard (2013), the LA Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin (2011), the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 David Robinson (1990) and the Houston Rockets\u2019 Ralph Sampson (1984). But the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young has had such an impressive second half of the season, the chances of Doncic grabbing 100 percent of the first-place votes are becoming less likely. * Blogtable:  Who are the favorites for Kia Rookie of the Year? Young\u2019s post-All-Star numbers have tightened things up so much it\u2019s worth looking back at a few of the more memorable Rookie of the Year votes. There have actually been co-winners three times: Boston\u2019s Dave Cowens and Geoff Petrie (1970-71), Dallas\u2019 Jason Kidd and the Detroit Pistons\u2019 Grant Hill (1994-95), and the Chicago Bulls\u2019 Elton Brand and Houston\u2019s Steve Francis (1999-2000). Here\u2019 a look at a few of the more memorable tight races over the last 15 or so seasons \u2026 * * * 2009-10: Tyreke Evans over Stephen Curry The Sacramento Kings\u2019 Evans edged out the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Curry by taking home 491 points to Curry\u2019s 391. Evans got 67 first-place votes while Curry got 43. The Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Brandon Jennings grabbed 12 first-place votes. Evans\u2019 best season in the NBA was actually his rookie campaign, in which he averaged 20.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 72 games. Curry, meanwhile, put up averages of 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists while shooting 46.2 percent from the field (43.7 on 3s). 2003-04: LeBron James over Carmelo Anthony LeBron and \u2018Melo both had impressive rookie seasons, but the No. 1 pick ended up taking home the hardware by grabbing 78 first-place votes to Anthony\u2019s 40. LeBron put up 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game, while \u2018Melo had similar stats, going for 21 ppg, 6.1 rpg and 2.8 apg. Anthony\u2019s case could be bolstered by the fact he led the Nuggets to the playoffs, while the Cavs fell short of the postseason. 2002-03: Amar\u2019e Stoudemire over Yao Ming Yao Ming, taken with the No. 1 pick by the Houston Rockets, averaged 13.5 points, 8.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks while shooting 49.8 percent. Stoudemire, whom the Suns took with the 9th pick, had almost identical numbers at 13.5 points, 8.8 rebounds and 1.1 blocks while shooting 47.2 percent from the field. Amar\u2019e, however, helped Phoenix edge out Houston for the final playoff spot in the West , which may have given him the final edge. It will be interesting to see how the votes shake out in this season\u2019s race. Will Doncic\u2019s season-long numbers and big shots be enough to overcome Young\u2019s late surge? I certainly don\u2019t expect a unanimous vote, but just how close will the final tally be? * * * 1. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  Last week:  No. 1 Young struggled with his shot a bit this week, but still managed to have some big moments. He fought through on off shooting night (5-for-19, 2-for-9 on 3s) on Sunday , but still dished out 16 assists and scored the game-winning bucket at the buzzer to stun Milwaukee in OT. After another off night in San Antonio (5-for-15 shooting, 0-for-6 on 3s), Young tallied his seventh 30-point, 10-assist of the season in the Hawks\u2019 130-122 win over the Sixers . Young finished with 33 points, seven rebounds, 12 assists, and just two turnovers (he has just seven total in his last five games) while finishing 12-for-18 from the field in one of his most complete games of the season. 2. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  Last week:  No. 2 After missing two games this week with a right thigh contusion, Doncic returned only to come up short while passing up a potential game-winning shot against the Wolves. With Dallas trailing by two, Doncic \u2014 who scored 27 points with 12 rebounds and six assists \u2014 deferred on the final play of the game after a beautiful stepback, setting up Jalen Brunson for a potential game-winner instead of taking the shot. Brunson missed the shot (he had to hurry and may not have even got it off in time) and Doncic stood behind his decision. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not a question. I trusted him. The whole team trusted him. It was a great shot. Sometimes it\u2019s not going to go in.\u201d For the record, Doncic finished March 22.5 percent from 3-point land , so maybe he was gun shy.  Last week:  No. 3 In three games this week (all losses), Bagley III averaged 16.3 points, 9.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 27.6 minutes per game. The No. 3 pick missed Sunday\u2019s contest with a stomach illness, but returned Tuesday night to put up 19 points on 7-for-28 shooting along with eight rebounds. The Kings\u2019 playoff hopes ended this week, but the future remains bright with Bagley likely taking a bigger role next season as Sacramento\u2019s young core looks to take the next step. Last week:  Not ranked The Clippers are one of the league\u2019s hottest teams, having won 13 of 15 in March, and Gilgeous-Alexander is a big reason. In four games this week, he averaged 17.3 ppg, 4 rpg, 4.3 apg and 2 spg. In March, he put up some ridiculous shooting numbers , shooting 52.3 percent overall and 59.4 percent on 3-pointers. He finished the month +4.1 and his true shooting percentage was 62.4 percent. It was a good month for him and the Clippers will need more of the same if they want to make a deep run in the playoffs. Last week:  No. 4 In three games this week, Sexton averaged 22 ppg on 45.6 percent shooting and will likely end the season as just the third rookie to score 2,000 points, average 16 ppg and shoot at least 40 percent on 3-pointers. The others: Larry Bird (ROY in 1980) and Stephen Curry (2nd in ROY in 2010). Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns Hat tip to NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann, who dug up this statistical gem , which shows Ayton\u2019s efficiency in the paint: Ayton is just the second rookie (Ben Simmons was the first) in the 23 years for which we have shot location data to shoot 70 percent or better on at least 300 shots in the restricted area. In his lone game this week, Ayton had 17 points and 13 rebounds before spraining his left ankle in the Suns\u2019 loss to the Grizzlies. Ayton also sat out Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Jazz and it\u2019s not likely the Suns will risk pushing their prize center to return with just three games remaining. Mitchell Robinson, New York Knicks The Knicks\u2019 big man had a big week with 13.5 ppg, 13.5 rpg and 2.8 bpg in 33.7 mpg. Despite struggling Wednesday night, Robinson still managed to get two blocks to extend his streak of games with two-plus blocks to 26. It\u2019s the second-longest streak by a rookie behind Hall of Famer David Robinson. Landry Shamet, LA Clippers Like Gilgeous-Alexander, Shamet has been crucial to the Clippers\u2019 incredible March, in which they went an NBA-best 13-2 . For the month, Shamet averaged 11.4 ppg while hitting 45.7 percent of his 3s (taking 6.7 per game). After missing a game last week with an ankle injury, Shamet returned to the starting lineup and averaged 10 ppg in four games this week. Aaron Holiday, Indiana Pacers With Darren Collison (groin) and Wesley Matthews (hamstring) out, Holiday saw big minutes in back-to-back wins over the Pistons. The point guard had 10 points and five assists in 25 minutes Monday night, then had seven points, six assists and two steals in 29 minutes Wednesday night. It\u2019s been an inconsistent season for Holiday minutes-wise, but Holiday could be a key contributor off the bench in spot duty during the playoffs. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, April 3 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

My case against the Bucks: The core of the team has never tasted the first week of May before. In a seven-game series, someone other than Giannis might need to be a hero for the Bucks. They\u2019ll likely need to go through the Boston Celtics and then either the Toronto Raptors or Philadelphia 76ers in the final two rounds, and either of those teams are capable of getting hot and throwing as much (if not more) smoke in Milwaukee\u2019s direction. John Schuhmann :  Making the case for the Bucks is pretty easy. They\u2019ve had the East\u2019s best offense, overall , in games played within the conference , and in games played between the top five teams. They\u2019ve also had the East\u2019s best defense, overall , in games within the conference , and in games played between the top five teams. The Bucks have the shooting to punish defenses for paying too much attention to Giannis Antetokounmpo. And defensively, they\u2019ve been the best in the league at both preventing and defending the most important shots on the floor (those near the basket). Because their defense allows a lot of 3-point attempts, though , the Bucks can be beat from beyond the arc from time to time. Two of the other top teams in the East \u2014 the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors \u2014 rank in the top 10 in both 3-point percentage and the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range . Of course, the case against the Bucks starts with health. If Malcolm Brogdon is out beyond the first round or if Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s injured right ankle doesn\u2019t fully heal by the conference semifinals, the Bucks will be vulnerable. Sekou Smith :  There\u2019s a legitimacy to being the league\u2019s best team from the start of training camp until the playoffs start that should serve these Bucks well. Coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s experience guiding teams in this territory gives the Bucks some institutional knowledge about how to navigate this part of the process. Their efficiency on both ends of the floor is the best indicator of the Bucks\u2019 viability as a true title contender. Having the chemistry as a group that they have, with Giannis Antetokounmpo as the centerpiece of what they do, I can see this Bucks team in The Finals. The case against them begins their one glaring flaw, and that\u2019s the fact that this group is still yet to win a series together. They have some hurdles to clear to probe to themselves and the rest of us that they are ready for prime time. Matchups will be critical, of course. And keeping their main rotation players as healthy as possible for a long run is paramount. At this point, however, I think the case for is stronger than than the case against these Bucks making The Finals."},{"id":34618,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-top-contenders-kia-rookie-year-2018-19","date":"2019-04-04","title":"Blogtable: Who are your top three candidates for the Kia Rookie of the Year?","content":" * * * Your top three candidates for Kia Rookie of the Year?  * * * Tas Melas :  1. Luka Doncic:  Doncic should become only the second foreign-born, foreign-grown player to win the ROY Award ( Pau Gasol in 2002 ). I mention that because the notion that \u201cHe played against men in Europe and, therefore, shouldn\u2019t win\u201d is off-base. Many great players have tried to do what Luka is doing (Manu Ginobili, Yao Ming, Dirk Nowitzki, Arvydas Sabonis, etc) and come up short. 2. Trae Young:  Growth, growth, growth. All kudos to Trae and Atlanta\u2019s staff for getting him to his current level. The Hawks could definitely win the Draft day trade with Dallas for Young depending on how the Draft pick shakes out, but this award is Luka\u2019s. 3. Deandre Ayton:  Ayton\u2019s solid season has been (rightfully) overshadowed, but he has gotten better defensively while staying extremely efficient offensively the entire season. Shaun Powell :  The leader is Luka Doncic , clearly the best and most consistent rookie since opening night, someone who was ready-made from the start and instantly became the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 go-to guy. Trae Young is the runner-up \u2014 he started slowly and needed a few months to become a more efficient shooter (although his passing was solid right away for the Atlanta Hawks). Third is Marvin Bagley III. Even though he came off the bench virtually the entire season for the Sacramento Kings and averaged fewer minutes than Doncic and Young, his production was consistent given his playing time. He was also a double-double threat most nights. John Schuhmann :  1. Luka Doncic:  The No. 3 pick started strong and never let up. The Mavs turned their offense over to a rookie \u2014 Doncic has recorded the highest rookie usage rate ( 29.5 percent ) in the 23 years for which we have play-by-play data \u2014 and have been the league\u2019s seventh-most improved offensive team, having scored 3.1 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season. That says a lot. 2. Trae Young:  The No. 5 pick is already one of the best pick-and-roll passers in the league. He has improved dramatically over the course over the last few months and in another season, he\u2019d be the Rookie of the Year. The Hawks have seen the same offensive improvement ( an increase of 3.1 points scored per 100 possessions ) as the Mavs have. But Young had pretty rough stretch early in the season and he remains a serious liability on defense. 3. Deandre Ayton:  The No. 1 pick is already a strong offensive player. He\u2019s just the second rookie in the 23 seasons for which we have shot location data to shoot 70 percent or better on at least 300 shots in the restricted area . He leads all rookies in rebounding percentage by a pretty wide margin and he showed some defensive improvement as the season went on.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019ve got Dallas wunderkind Luka Doncic holding onto a slight lead over Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young for the top overall spot on my ballot. We\u2019ve been marveling at Luka\u2019s work for so long, he doesn\u2019t really feel like a rookie anymore. Young has been so good down the stretch that it\u2019s impossible to ignore his growth and development since his shaky start of the season. And it\u2019s more than just his flashy play. He\u2019s certainly been spectacular down the stretch this season, hitting game-winners and fueling upset wins over league powers. The future is bright for the Hawks with Young leading the way. It\u2019s strange how little buzz he\u2019s getting for the season he\u2019s put together, but No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton is third on my ballot just ahead of Marvin Bagley III , whose had some of that same recent energy to his game for Sacramento. * * *"},{"id":34608,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-best-nba-prospects-2019-final-four","date":"2019-04-04","title":"Blogtable: Best NBA prospects in 2019 Final Four?","content":" * * * Who are the best NBA prospects in this weekend\u2019s NCAA Final Four?  * * * Shaun Powell :  Based on early draft projections, the Final Four isn\u2019t exactly loaded with high lottery picks.

Riding another double-double from Nikola Vucevic and big boost from Terrence Ross off the bench, the Magic beat the New York Knicks, 114-100 , for their eighth victory in 10 games. The win, combined with losses by Detroit, Brooklyn and Miami, moved Orlando from ninth in the Eastern Conference standings into a tie for seventh, just a half-game behind the Detroit Pistons for the No. 6 seed. \u201cIt\u2019s still a tight race and things can change quickly, but obviously we\u2019re in a good spot, right where we want to be,\u201d Vucevic told reporters after the game.

Popovich made light of the situation after Wednesday\u2019s game, interrupting Michael Malone\u2019s press session with some classic Popovich sarcasm. \u201cWhat was the record, what happened?\u201d Popovich asked. \u201cSomeone got thrown out in 63 seconds,\u201d Malone responded. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThat person must have hit somebody. Did somebody get hit tonight? Did somebody get cursed at or anything?\u201d Carter makes broadcasting debut  Vince Carter got the night off after playing 28 minutes in San Antonio on Tuesday night and spent the Sixers-Hawks game as an analyst on Atlanta\u2019s TV broadcast. Carter, 42, said before the game that he\u2019s leaning toward coming back next season for what would be an unprecedented 22nd in the NBA. He also added he\u2019s \u201c1,000-percent certain\u201d he will become a broadcaster after retiring. Perhaps the best moment of the broadcast came late in the first quarter when Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce jokingly tried to sub in Carter. Crossover of the night  Reggie Jackson dropped Myles Turner to the floor with a fake off the dribble and then buried a step-back 3-pointer. Yes, Jackson stepped on Turner\u2019s foot, but that didn\u2019t stop the Twitterverse from exploding. Taking advantage of the Denver altitude, Nuggets guard Malik Beasley elevates and puts Spurs rookie Drew Eubanks on a poster. \u201cMaybe he thinks differently now.\u201d \u2014 Trae Young, responding to a reporter\u2019s question about Ben Simmons\u2019 support for Luka Doncic in the Kia Rookie of the Year race Young finished with 33 points and 12 assists in the Hawks\u2019 130-122 victory over the Sixers. \u2022 Bradley Beal became the first player in Washington franchise history with 2,000 points, 400 rebounds and 400 assists in a season. \u2022 Andre Drummond tied his own team record with his 66th double-double of the season.

Foster concocted \u201ca fraudulent scheme\u201d to enrich himself with company money and also buy property in Ethiopia, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. It seeks more than $2 million in damages. A number for Foster and information about his attorneys could not be found Wednesday. Foster mishandled tax filings and failed to distribute profits to Ball, the complaint alleges. Ball, who owns 51% of Big Baller Brand, has removed Foster as a manager of the company. The lawsuit accuses Foster of making unexplained cash withdrawals totaling at least $1.5 million between 2016 and 2018. The suit says when confronted, Foster was unable to account for the missing funds and threatened \u201cto publicly disseminate false and misleading information\u201d about the Ball family. Ball said in a statement last month that he had recently learned Foster was a convicted felon. Foster hid his criminal past from his partners and presented himself as an experienced business manager who could help maximize profits, according to this week\u2019s court filing. Foster was convicted in 2002 of defrauding more than 70 people of nearly $4 million, ESPN reported last month. He was forced to pay back most of that money and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Foster served five years but violated the terms of his probation and spent another five months behind bars in 2009, the report said.

We continue with the Kia NBA Rookie of the Year Award. This isn\u2019t a case for or against any particular player. It\u2019s just a dive into some of the relevant numbers for consideration. * * * More articles from this series: Here are the rookies that have averaged the most points + rebounds + assists per game\u2026 Both the Atlanta Hawks and Dallas Mavericks have turned their offenses over to rookies. Through Tuesday\u2019s games, Luka Doncic has recorded the highest usage rate for a rookie in the 23 years for which we have play-by-play data. Trae Young is also in the top 10\u2026 Behind Doncic and Young in usage rate this season are Collin Sexton, Marvin Bagley III and Jaren Jackson Jr.  Rookies are not known for scoring efficiently, but three rookies \u2014 Deandre Ayton (72.7 percent), Mitchell Robinson (70.2 percent) and Jackson (69.3 percent) \u2014 rank in the top 25 in field goal percentage in the restricted area among players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. Ayton is just the second rookie (Ben Simmons was the first) in the 23 years for which we have shot location data to shoot 70 percent or better on at least 300 shots in the restricted area. Allonzo Trier (.431) and Doncic (.412), meanwhile, rank sixth and ninth, respectively, in free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) among non-bigs with at least 500 field goal attempts. Here are rookie leaders in true shooting percentage (which measures scoring efficiency)\u2026 And here are rookie leaders in assist\/turnover ratio among those with an assist ratio (assists per 100 possessions used) of 10 or greater\u2026 OffRtg = Team\u2019s points scored per 100 possessions with player on the floor. AST% = Percentage of teammate field goals player assisted on while on the floor. AST Ratio, TO Ratio = Assists\/turnovers per 100 possessions used.  Mitchell Robinson leads the league, by a wide margin, with 4.5 blocks per 36 minutes . That\u2019s the most for a rookie since the late Manute Bol averaged 6.8 per 36 in the 1985-86 season and the fourth most for any player (that\u2019s played at least 1,000 minutes) in the last 23 years, trailing marks of Serge Ibaka ( 4.8 in 2011-12 ), Alonzo Mourning ( 4.8 in 2005-06 ) and Hassan Whiteside ( 4.6 in 2015-16 ). Of course, Robinson also ranks second with 5.9 personal fouls per 36 minutes. He ranks 17th among rookies in total defensive win shares, with Jackson, despite playing just 58 games, leading the group by a pretty wide margin. The Grizzlies allowed just 102.4 points per 100 possessions with Jackson on the floor. That\u2019s the seventh-lowest on-court DefRtg among 220 players that have averaged at least minutes in 40 games or more this seaso n . Only one rookie \u2014 the LA Clippers\u2019 Landry Shamet (plus-97) \u2014 has played at least 750 minutes and registered a positive plus-minus . Last season, there were 11 rookies with a positive plus-minus in 750 minutes or more. Of course, one of those guys (Milos Teodosic) is no longer in the league and another (Jawun Evans) was waived by the Phoenix Suns last month. The only other rookies who have played at least 1,000 minutes for a team that still has a (real) chance at the postseason are Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (minus-84 in 2,050 minutes for the Clippers), Bruce Brown (minus-42 in 1,348 minutes for Detroit) and Rodions Kurucs (minus-3 in 1,207 minutes Brooklyn). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Indeed, we\u2019ve become so accustomed to his jaw-dropping performances that there\u2019s been virtually zero fanfare for the fact that he\u2019s all but assured of averaging a triple-double for a third straight season. But the Thunder superstar outdid himself Tuesday in a 119-103 victory over the Lakers , joining Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to reach or surpass 20 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a single game. Chamberlain set the gold standard for NBA triple-doubles in 1968, piling up 22 points, 25 rebounds and 21 assists against the Pistons in what had for decades seemed to be one of his most unassailable feats, right up with his 50.4-point season and legendary 100-point game. But despite an off shooting night that resulted in a scoreless first quarter, Westbrook followed suit with 20 points, 20 rebounds and 21 assists, pulling down one last board with 41 seconds remaining to check the final box. \u201cOverwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m humbled. I\u2019m just thankful to be able to compete at a high level and play the game I love.\u201d Said teammate Paul George, \u201cIt\u2019s just epic. Man. The heart of that guy, honestly, is what\u2019s so amazing about it.\u201d Westbrook\u2019s feat couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for him or his team. Not only were the Thunder, who had lost 13 of 20 games since the All-Star break, in desperate need of a victory, it came just days after Westbrook\u2019s friend, hip-hop artist and fellow Los Angeles native Nipsey Hussle, was murdered outside his clothing store in L.A. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t for me, that was for my bro \u2014 20 plus 20 plus 20,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cRest in peace, Nipsey.\u201d To put Westbrook\u2019s achievement into further perspective, there had only been 45 games of even 15\/15\/15 in NBA history entering Tuesday\u2019s action, including seven by him. And quadruple-doubles, as exceptionally rare as they are, have still been achieved four times, by Nate Thurmond (1974), Alvin Robertson (1986), Hakeem Olajuwon (1990) and David Robinson (1994). But the double triple-double? A fraternity of one \u2014 until now. Westbrook laid the foundation with a unique first quarter in which he failed to score but pulled down seven boards and dished out 10 assists. The latter total was notable (if esoteric) in and of itself, making Westbrook just the fifth player over the past 20 years with multiple double-digit assist quarters. That would have been the highlight of Westbrook\u2019s night in most other games. But as his scoring touch came around to match his additional production, it became apparent that something truly special was brewing. Westbrook might have been the last to realize as he didn\u2019t appear to be actively pursuing the feat until the final few minutes, when he began camping under the baskets in pursuit of boards. And with a feat of such singular significance within his grasp, who could really blame him? Certainly not his fellow players, who were every bit as dumbstruck as anyone else who watched it unfold. 20 20 20 we know wat it is Russ that was legendary #LongLiveNip \u2014 Richaun Holmes (@Rich_Holmes22) April 3, 2019 \u2013to do any ONE of those things is hard! To do TWO is one of the best games of a person's career. To do all THREE, and factor in the circumstances.. = Legendary.. https:\/\/t.co\/nlvWZFlSkp \u2014 \ud83c\udfc1 Jamal Crawford (@JCrossover) April 3, 2019 Wow this is REAL\ud83d\udcaf \u2014 Zach LaVine (@ZachLaVine) April 3, 2019 On the macro level, Westbrook continues to climb up the career triple-double list , with his 135 standing just three behind Magic Johnson in second place. Should he maintain his torrid pace in recent seasons, in which he\u2019s averaged roughly 33 triple-doubles over the past three campaigns, Westbrook will have a shot at yet another seemingly untouchable mark, Oscar Robertson\u2019s record of 181. No matter where he ends up on the list, it\u2019s unthinkable to imagine any of his future triple-doubles will match, let alone surpass, what Westbrook did Tuesday. Then again, Russ has proven to be quite adept at doing the seemingly impossible. It started well enough for the Denver Nuggets, who led for most of the first quarter of their crucial Western Conference matchup with the Golden State Warriors before falling behind by six entering the second. But from there? The two-time defending champions left absolutely no doubt that, despite their almost bizarrely inconsistent play this season, they are still very much the team to beat. The 116-102 final didn\u2019t do nearly enough justice to the full extent of the Warriors\u2019 dominance. Shaking off their early deficit, they proceeded to steamroll the Nuggets with ruthless efficiency, steadily building their lead up to 30 in the fourth before finally shackling the dogs. Not even Kevin Durant\u2019s ejection in the third could slow the Warriors, who were otherwise fortified by the best performance of DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 abbreviated season (28 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, two steals, two blocks) and a stifling defensive effort that limited the potent Nuggets to 37.5-percent shooting. Cousins utterly dominated his matchup with Nuggets All-Star Nikola Jokic, who finished with just 10 points and five rebounds. Boogie Cousins asking where Jokic at? LOL pic.twitter.com\/2Sffzeg8ry \u2014 gifdsports (@gifdsports) April 3, 2019 Not very sportsmanlike. But when you\u2019ve spent the evening doing things like this to one of the best players in the NBA \u2026 \u2026 you\u2019re free to celebrate however you like. And with all that, the Warriors have all but wrapped up first place in the West with both a two-game lead and the head-to-head tiebreaker entering the final week of play. It\u2019s just more proof that, until proven otherwise, they still have a gear no other team can come close to matching. Brighter days lay ahead for the Hawks thanks to a promising young core led by Trae Young and John Collins. They might even be able to win a game in San Antonio \u2026 eventually, anyway. For now, despite a respectable effort in which the Hawks led for much of the fourth quarter before falling apart late, the Alamo City continues to be their personal house of horrors with 21 straight losses. Atlanta\u2019s last win in San Antonio came in February 1997, when: 1. Hawks legend Dominique Wilkins was still playing \u2026 for the Spurs. 2. Young was 19 months away from being born. The Rockets enjoyed their latest 3-point extravaganza, sinking 26 against the Kings to tie the single-game record they set last December in a victory over Washington. Of the 17 instances where an NBA team has hit 23 or more 3s, the Rockets now account for eight of them, with seven coming over the past three seasons alone.

The Wizards announced his dismissal with four games left in a disappointing, no-playoffs season. Washington is 32-46 and in 11th place in the 15-team Eastern Conference. \u201cWe did not meet our stated goals of qualifying for the playoffs this season,\u201d owner Ted Leonsis said in a statement issued by the Wizards, \u201cand, despite playing with injuries to several key players, we have a culture of accountability and a responsibility of managing to positive outcomes.\u201d Point guard John Wall and center Dwight Howard both missed most of the season, and forward Markieff Morris also was injured before getting traded. The club went 568-724 during Grunfeld\u2019s tenure, including eight postseason appearances. But Washington never made it past the second round of the playoffs and never won at least 50 games in a season, despite having All-Stars such as Wall, Bradley Beal, Gilbert Arenas, Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison. Tommy Sheppard, senior vice president of basketball operations, will take over Grunfeld\u2019s duties for now and will be a candidate to replace him permanently. There is a lot of work to do. Wall is expected to be sidelined for much, if not all, of next season, too. Beal is the only other elite player who is under contract for next season. Otherwise, the cupboard is rather bare, and because of the large contracts Grunfeld gave Wall and Beal \u2014 not to mention backup center Ian Mahinmi, who rarely plays \u2014 there is not a lot of money available to bring top-level free agents to the Wizards.

Instead of feeling an embrace, he was stabbed by jabs. \u201cFlopper,\u201d they called Nikola Jokic. And: \u201cWhiner.\u201d Initially he was taken aback, until he saw the grins behind the insults, and then he realized he just got played by a handful of fun-loving All-Stars who took advantage of him, a Serbian still trying to fully grasp the slang and the culture and the cut-ups. And who was the worst among them? \u201cBlake Griffin,\u201d said Jokic. \u201cAnd Giannis,\u201d which would be Antetokounmpo. \u201cKyle Kuzma, too. \u201cAnd also Steph Curry, he was really on me.\u201d But then the Nuggets center wanted to make this point: \u201cI think it was their way of showing respect, not just for me, but our team. They know we are not a joke.\u201d Well, that much is for certain: The Nuggets are nobody\u2019s punch line, not after 51 wins and sitting in the attic of the Western Conference for virtually the entire season, and not after Jokic took a generous step in the direction of being a superstar, or at least the most skilled big man in the game. After a three-year rebuild, they have arrived to a degree. \u201cWe have a continuity, a group that\u2019s been together for a while and that\u2019s definitely helped because now you learn to play with and for and off each other,\u201d said coach Mike Malone. \u201cFive guys out there as one.\u201d Still, the question does linger in the high altitude air: Are the Nuggets really and truly a member of the club? Perhaps some clues will be unlocked Tuesday when they visit the Warriors with first place on the line , perhaps not. It\u2019s always tricky to use the regular season to make assumptions on the playoffs because we\u2019ve all been fooled by that before, in both directions. The playoffs are often determined by matchups and momentum, which have a sway in determining how deep any team travels through spring and early summer. In the case of the Nuggets, it\u2019s the whiff of uncertainty about a newcomer, about a group of players and a coach who haven\u2019t been there and done that, about a club that will make its first playoff appearance since 2013. Internally, are they merely happy to be here, thrilled with this next phase of their rapid development and satisfied as long as they don\u2019t get tripped in the first round? Or are they dreaming bigger than that? Maybe, and perhaps with some justification, everyone should be OK with the Nuggets just making it to May because it\u2019s so hard to go from zero to 60 in this league. Remember, the Nuggets didn\u2019t even make the playoffs last season, missing the cut on Game 82. And this team has taken the gradual approach to building, helping itself through the draft and a few trades and free agent signings and remains relatively young; only five players boast playoff experience. Championship teams or even contenders are rarely, if ever, built overnight. Plus: Even in what constitutes as a breakout and franchise-turning season for them, the Nuggets have shown their flipside. They\u2019ve been issued a pair of smackdowns by the two-time defending champion Warriors, once by 31 points. They\u2019ve lost three of four to the Rockets and the last meeting by 27. In both instances, the Nuggets fed the perception that they\u2019re not quite there yet as a contender and possibly intimidated by the heavies on the block. Also, Denver is feeble on the road, barely above water at 20-18. If the visiting Nuggets got rattled in the regular season, how can they expect to cope with the playoff-charged road atmosphere starting in two weeks? There\u2019s the notion that the Nuggets need to capture the best record in the West to ensure home-court advantage throughout the playoffs \u2014 they\u2019re 31-7 at home so far \u2014 but that\u2019s only important if they find themselves staring at the Warriors in the conference finals. More important is the final order of the standings from No. 1 to 4 which will likely be among the Warriors, Nuggets, Rockets and Blazers. The weak link is Portland as the Blazers must make do without injured center Jusuf Nurkic. Whoever gets the Blazers in the semifinals, assuming the seeds hold true through the first round, has the easier path. In any event, there\u2019s plenty of positive about a well-balanced Nuggets team, starting with their solid two-man core of Jokic (20.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.4 assists) and Jamal Murray (18.2 points). Malone is high on Murray even though, statistically, there hasn\u2019t been significant growth in his game from a year ago. Malone says Murray has a better grip on the point guard position, which isn\u2019t easy on a team where the offense is run through the center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that more from Jamal he\u2019s understanding of a starting point guard and the responsibility that comes with that,\u201d Malone said. \u201cJamal is gifted offensively. Now it\u2019s about taking the good shot and right shot.\u201d There\u2019s also a rotation that can go nine or even 10 deep, giving Malone a chance to use multiple combinations and looks depending on the opponent. The Nuggets\u2019 defense has ranked among the best in the league all season and while the offense has been spotty lately, they can score in bunches \u2014 especially if Jokic finds the open man as he often does. \u201cWe just need to be more consistent,\u201d said Jokic. \u201cWhen we\u2019re consistent, with how we approach the game and how we are focused, that\u2019s the best thing. It\u2019s a new thing for us. Every night is the most important game of the season.\u201d The wild cards for the postseason are Gary Harris, Will Barton and Paul Millsap. Harris hasn\u2019t been a big producer this season and dealt with injuries, just like Barton. Both commanded contract extensions and are better than they\u2019ve shown so far. Millsap is the only player in the rotation with deep playoff experience yet his time in Denver since signing as a free agent two years ago has been marked by inconsistency. Yes, on this team, even veterans aren\u2019t immune to flashes. \u201cOur shot selection at times has not been great,\u201d said Malone. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s our players being selfish. I think that\u2019s guys trying to help our team out. When we\u2019re at our best, we\u2019re a ball-movement, play-for-each-other type team.\u201d The Nuggets craved respect for what they\u2019ve shown this season and they\u2019re getting it, yet there\u2019s also a sense of being careful what you ask for. The teams standing in their way aren\u2019t letting down their guard; on the contrary, Warriors coach Steve Kerr mentioned how much Tuesday\u2019s game means to \u2026 the Warriors. \u201cWe take care of business and win,\u201d said Kerr, \u201cand we\u2019re in great shape. There\u2019s more of a sense of urgency now.\u201d The Nuggets reached one of their goals long ago by qualifying for the playoffs. Now they begin to answer the most perplexing question about them: What next? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

No. 6 Detroit, No. 7 Brooklyn, No. 8 Miami, No. 9 Orlando and No. 10 Charlotte all lost, squandering opportunities to gain ground among a group separated by less than four games at the bottom of the postseason field. No. 4 Boston and No. 5 Indiana both won to push their records to an identical 46-32 as they approach a Friday matchup in Indianapolis that will likely dictate who earns home-court advantage in the first round. Philadelphia, locked into the third spot barring a massive collapse, had little to play for and performed like it in a listless loss to Dallas as Joel Embiid (rest) and Jimmy Butler (back) both sat. No. 2 Toronto dominated Orlando to clinch the Atlantic Division and, as a result, will finish no worse than second. And while the Raptors still have a mathematical chance to take first, Milwaukee\u2019s victory over the Nets put it in pole position. With four games remaining for each team, one Bucks win or one Raptors loss will give the former not only the best record in the East but the entire NBA. With that finish will come home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, a formidable edge for a team that has won 32 of 38 outings in Milwaukee this season. With respect to their great 1980s teams led by Sidney Moncrief, it\u2019s territory the Bucks haven\u2019t seen since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was patrolling the paint almost 50 years ago, and roughly two decades before their current superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, was born in 1994. Per usual, Antetokounmpo was the difference against the feisty Nets, pouring in 14 of his 28 points over the final 12 minutes as the Bucks staved off multiple runs in a battle featuring 18 lead changes and six ties. But beyond serving as yet another showcase of Antetokounmpo\u2019s greatness, the game was also a testament to the Bucks\u2019 depth as they overcame the absence of seven players, including All-Star guard Khris Middleton (groin). All five starters scored in double-figures, led by Eric Bledsoe\u2019s 29, and veteran reserve George Hill added 22 off the bench. Even without five of their top 10 scorers, the Bucks still put up 131 to offset a rare off night from their league-leading defense. In short, they did whatever it took to earn the victory, something they\u2019ve excelled at during a charmed season in which they\u2019ve managed to surprise even themselves. \u201cI thought we were going to be a really good team,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, \u201cbut to be honest, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have the best record in the NBA. It feels amazing. It\u2019s been fun so far. Everyone is happy, they have a smile on their face. So we\u2019re just going to keep rolling.\u201d The latest stop in Dwyane Wade\u2019s retirement tour might have been the coolest, with Celtics general manager Danny Ainge presenting the Heat legend with a piece of the hallowed parquet floor from their 2007-08 championship season. \u201cI appreciate the respect they showed me as a player to present me with a piece of the history of the Celtics,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThat was so cool. I definitely didn\u2019t expect it at all. I just want to thank them for that gesture.\u201d  https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBA\/status\/1112870122312667136 Hornets guard Kemba Walker went off for 47 points in Utah, including 38 in the second half, and it wasn\u2019t even close to enough in a 111-102 loss in which the Jazz led by as many as 20 and trailed for a grand total of 2:01. The culprits? Look no further than the other four Hornets starters, with Marvin Williams and Miles Bridges combining to go scoreless in 50 total minutes and Bismack Biyombo and Dwayne Bacon contributing just four and two points, respectively. Those six points accounted for a paltry 11.3 percent of the Hornets\u2019 starting scoring, the lowest percentage from four starters since the NBA began tracking lineups in 1970-71. (Elias Sports) This wasn\u2019t exactly how you\u2019d draw it up, but the Celtics finished one of the better sequences of the night in style: The tributes for slain rapper Nipsey Hussle continued, with Kawhi Leonard contributing a hand-made take on his signature New Balances. We\u2019re not sure which was more impressive, Thon Maker jumping completely over a fellow member of the Exceptionally Large Human Club, or Bojan Bogdanovic keeping his composure upon being cleared to make the layup: Portland\u2019s Evan Turner earned one of the most esoteric records you\u2019ll ever see with his triple-double against the Timberwolves: Knicks rookie Mitchell Robinson\u2019s shot-blocking exploits are something we haven\u2019t seen in the NBA from a first-year player since another Robinson tore it up back in the day.

In an interview with Joe Vardon of The Athletic , James says his basketball plans are \u201cdamn near set\u201d for an offseason that began on Sunday when James sat out his first of six games to close out L.A.\u2019s disappointing season. The Lakers, 35-42, were eliminated from playoff contention on March 23. The team shut down James so he could have more time to heal his injured left groin. James \u2014 who has reached the NBA Finals every season since 2010 \u2014 is eager to utilize extra training time this offseason. \u201cI\u2019ve had basically the same offseason training regimen the last eight years,\u201d James told The Athletic. \u201cI knew how long I wanted to rest for the season on a short timeline. I\u2019m figuring out now how to get as much as I can out of two months of extra time for training. It requires a totally different strategy. We\u2019re looking at it in an entirely new way.\u201d James will begin production on \u201cSpace Jam 2\u201d this summer and, according to Vardon, the set will feature a full-length basketball court so James can train during production. The film, which is produced by James\u2019 SpringHill Entertainment, is scheduled to release in July 2021 \u2014 25 years after the original film starring Michael Jordan was released in 1996. Because of the busy production schedule, James won\u2019t join coach Gregg Popovich and Team USA during the FIBA World Cup in China this summer. \u201cI love everything about Pop, obviously,\u201d James told The Athletic. \u201cBut this is not a good summer for me.\u201d However, James didn\u2019t rule out being involved with the team for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a possibility. It depends on how I feel. I love the Olympics.\u201d James is a three-time Olympic medalist, winning gold in 2008 and 2012 with Team USA and bronze in 2004. In his first season with the Lakers, the 36-year-old averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists and passed Jordan for fourth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list.

But right now, the eighth-place team in the East (the 38-38 Miami Heat) has a better record than the ninth-place team in the West (the 38-39 Sacramento Kings). So it\u2019s possible that the 16 playoff teams will be the same 16 teams that would have made the postseason if conferences were ignored (not taking schedule imbalance into account). The East race for the final three spots has heated up. No potential 6-8 seed should be a major threat to any of the top three in the East. But there\u2019s intrigue with every team involved. The Detroit Pistons are the only Eastern Conference team that hasn\u2019t won a playoff game in the last 10 years, and they\u2019re trying end their drought in their first full season with Blake Griffin and Dwane Casey\u2019s first year on the bench. They seem to be in good position to finish sixth, but Griffin is dealing with a left knee injury that will have him out for their game in Indiana on Monday. The Brooklyn Nets are the underdog story. They had the East\u2019s worst record over the last three seasons and haven\u2019t had their own draft pick since 2013, but have benefited from player development and smart moves made in the margins. They\u2019ve already won 11 more games than they did last season, but still have some work to do and five tough games left on their schedule. The Miami Heat are trying to get Dwyane Wade to one last postseason. They lost a big game to Orlando last week, but were an East-best 11-4 in March and still control their own destiny, with what could be a huge game in Brooklyn on the last night of the season. The Orlando Magic have won seven of their last eight games (and are 18-8 since Jan. 31) to stay right in the mix. They\u2019re trying to end the East\u2019s longest playoff drought (six years without an appearance) and have been the league\u2019s second most improved team in regard to winning percentage. With 12 days left in the season, anything can happen with these four teams. It will be a success story for the three that make the playoffs and a disappointment for the one that doesn\u2019t.

While some could make an argument that Byrd \u2014 who has spent the last 33 seasons at Belmont \u2014 has coached better players than Dylan Windler , it\u2019s doubtful he\u2019s ever had a better athlete. Byrd, who with Windler\u2019s help just guided Belmont to the school\u2019s first NCAA Tournament at-large bid and first victory in the tournament, has always marveled at Windler\u2019s athleticism. Like a multi-instrumentalist who can play anything he picks up, Windler excels at sports, whether they\u2019re played with a racket, club, bat or just a ball. \u201cHe\u2019s a great athlete, but also, he just understands how to win,\u201d Byrd says. \u201cHe\u2019s our team\u2019s best ping pong player. In softball, he covers the entire outfield and makes plays, and hits it a mile. He was a serious junior golfer and didn\u2019t play AAU basketball until his senior year of high school. He\u2019s also good at soccer and tennis. You could invent a game of some sort \u2014 combining whatever two sports you wanted to \u2014 explain the rules, and Dylan would be the best player at it.\u201d That athletic ability, plus a 6-foot-8 frame and a 6-11 wingspan, just might propel Windler into the NBA Draft . He\u2019s consistently showed up in the mock drafts, and his stock rose last week after he blasted Maryland of the rugged Big Ten with 35 points, 21 of them coming from 3-pointers, and 11 rebounds in a first-round NCAA loss. The Bruins, dispatched to the tournament\u2019s First Four in Dayton, had earned that matchup with the Terps by beating Temple. Windler, obviously drawing extra defensive attention, scored just five points in that game, but he still got his typical allotment of boards (14; he averaged 10.8 this season), along with two assists and three steals. The Owls\u2019 deep concern of Windler going off on them allowed Belmont\u2019s Kevin McClain that honor \u2014 he scored 29 points in the upset victory. It was a testament to Windler that whenever Belmont played a power conference team \u2014 they lost to Purdue and won at UCLA this season \u2014 Windler always drew double coverage, and though his points were limited, he understood there were other things he could do to help his team. He scored seven points against the Boilermakers, who have advanced to the NCAA Tournament\u2019s Elite Eight, but contributed 11 boards, three assists and two steals. At UCLA Windler scored just 12 points, nine below his season average, but racked up 15 boards. \u201cTo his credit, Dylan didn\u2019t try to make it happen when it wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Byrd says. \u201cIt gave teammates more opportunities, because nobody\u2019s helping off of him.\u201d Byrd admits he doesn\u2019t spend nearly as much time watching the NBA as some of his college counterparts. Other than Ian Clark, he hasn\u2019t coached a player who\u2019s advanced to that level. So Byrd defers judgement whether Windler can play in the NBA. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about that world,\u201d Byrd says. \u201cI watch the NBA some. But I\u2019ll tell you this \u2014 he\u2019s worked out a lot with Ian Clark [who\u2019s played for Utah, Denver, Golden State and New Orleans in an eight-year NBA career], and Ian definitely thinks Dylan can play in the NBA. Ian\u2019s got a reference point I don\u2019t have.\u201d Windler has an interesting story. He was so good at so many sports that his best one was overlooked by college coaches. That was with good reason. Until the summer before his senior season at Perry Meridian High School in Indianapolis, Windler thought golf would be his game. During the summers \u2014 valuable time for high school basketball players to improve and showcase their skills on the AAU circuit \u2014 Windler played in junior golf tournaments. In the summer of 2014, Windler, who was trying to decide whether to focus on golf or basketball, got an offer to join the Indiana Elite AAU team, which also included Purdue\u2019s Ryan Cline and Virginia\u2019s Kyle Guy, both of whom are playing for NCAA Tournament Elite Eight teams. Indiana Elite was so loaded Windler was no better than the seventh scoring option. But during one tournament in his hometown, a couple of the team\u2019s stars were off participating in an adidas camp, and Windler was elevated to the starting lineup. Suffice it to say he was able to showcase his skills. He left that tournament with 15 Division I scholarship offers. Tennessee Tech was the first to extend an invitation. \u201cOnce I got a college offer set in stone, I decided basketball was the way to go,\u201d Windler says. \u201cSo I went all in on basketball. I trained all the time and was always in the gym getting shots up. And I ended up having a good senior season in high school.\u201d By that time, Byrd, who likes to recruit basketball-mad states, which he mines for winners, shooters and players who understand how to play the game, had already locked up Windler, who committed in July 2014. Though he could have waited on an offer from Indiana or Purdue in the spring of 2015, he went with the sure thing. Windler has never doubted his decision. In his time at Belmont, the Bruins were 94-34 despite having to play demanding non-conference schedules, finished first in the Ohio Valley Conference three times and second once, played in two NITs and then ended his career with a memorable NCAA Tournament trip. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much about the game in general from coach Byrd,\u201d Windler says. \u201cOffensively, he\u2019s boosted my game and given me the confidence to play the way I have. I have freedom, the green light to shoot. I\u2019ve learned about games and situations, and to value possessions.\u201d Windler has yet to sign with an agent, but he\u2019s certain to be working out with another former Belmont star, Drew Hanlen, who has become an in-demand shot doctor and workout guru for aspiring NBA players. Windler has a list of skills he wants to polish before, he hopes, he\u2019s extended a visit to the NBA\u2019s Chicago Draft Combine. \u201cI want to be more of a playmaker,\u201d hey says. \u201cI want to be able to finish over length. Adding to my vertical leap can always help. I\u2019ll be working on gaining more weight and muscle. There\u2019s always room for growth in that regard.\u201d In a certain system, on a certain team, Windler could become a valuable piece, with his 3-point shooting range, ability to get to the rim, aggressive rebounding and defensive ability. Windler, who\u2019s not the least bit cocky, sees a future in the league. \u201cI think I can really be a good 3 and D guy,\u201d Windler says. \u201cA guy that can knock down shots and defend multiple positions.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

A season that began with modest expectations \u2013 worse than modest, according to some alleged experts \u2013 and then appeared to shift into reverse two-thirds of the way through the schedule merited a little celebration. So that\u2019s what they did last week in Minneapolis, with coach Doc Rivers handing the bubbly duties to forward Danilo Gallinari after their blue-collar team clinched a berth in the 2019 Western Conference playoffs. https:\/\/twitter.com\/LAClippers\/status\/1110751157356388352\/video\/1 They took some teasing for what was, that particular evening, an unremarkable March victory over a lottery-bound Timberwolves team in Minnesota. But when you\u2019re picked not just to miss the playoffs but to finish significantly below .500, and when you instead snag not merely a postseason berth but stay positioned to push into the top four in the ultra-competitive West, heck, tease away. Twice so far, these Clippers have proved folks wrong. They already surpassed the preseason expectations of many. And they have gone 17-5 since the February trade deadline, when they cashiered three-fifths of their early-season starting lineup. In the process, Rivers has thrust himself into Coach of the Year debates (20 years after he won it as a rookie coach in Orlando in 1999-2000) while getting his team back to the postseason after a two-year absence. Before and after LA\u2019s game at Milwaukee Thursday, Rivers spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner. This Q&A is edited from those conversations. Steve Aschburner : So I\u2019ve never seen a team so happy to convey a first-round draft pick to a rival. [The Clippers owed Boston a first-round pick stemming from their 2016 deal with Memphis for Jeff Green. That pick was lottery-protected in 2019 and 2020, converting to a 2022 second-round pick if not conveyed by then.] Doc Rivers : The way we looked at it, and what people didn\u2019t understand, was that we were going to lose it next year anyway. The pick was either going to go this year or next year. So take your medicine now. At the point of the [February] trades, even if we quote-unquote tanked, we still wouldn\u2019t have gotten a great pick. It was too late. SA : You should think about turning the number 33, your expected victory total according to some experts, into a jersey emblem for the playoffs. Or a rallying cry. DR : Yeah, yeah, \u201c15 > 33.\u201d SA : And your plan is to improve your position further, if possible? DR : We\u2019re not done. We took a second to celebrate. Took another second [Wednesday night] to celebrate Ralph [Lawler, the team\u2019s iconic broadcaster wrapping up his 40-year gig]. We\u2019ve enjoyed the journey throughout. We\u2019ve had a lot of dinners together as a group. So it\u2019s been that type of team. But in our minds, we\u2019re not done. We want to keep pushing. See where we can get, and then once we get in, see what we can do.  SA : How did you get here, after those roster moves? [The Clippers traded their All-Star candidate Tobias Harris, with Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott to Philadelphia for Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet and four future draft picks. They sent Avery Bradley to Memphis for JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple, flipped Muscala to the Lakers for Ivica Zubac and waived Marcin Gortat and Milos Teodosic. Harris, Bradley and Gortat had started 55, 49 and 43 games respectively for the Clippers.] DR : It was the toughest challenge from a coaching standpoint I\u2019ve ever faced. We had a group of guys who were playing absolutely fantastic. And we were on our way to making the playoffs, though we were still seeded eighth. And not only did we trade, but we ended up getting way younger. We went to playing [Zubac] at 22, [rookie guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander] at 20, and [Shamet] at 22 in our starting lineup. So when you think about that part of it, and yet we got better. SA : Why have they, despite their inexperience, been able to handle what you\u2019ve thrown at them?  DR : We don\u2019t give them a lot of excuses. I told \u2019em that the first day: \u201cYouth is not an excuse.\u201d We say it every day. \u201cLet\u2019s not use youth as a reason we\u2019re losing.\u201d We tell them, \u201cWe forgive you for all mistakes because someone tricked you or vetted you. But there\u2019s no forgiveness for not playing hard. They\u2019re no forgiveness for not having focus. There\u2019s no forgiveness for not knowing the game play.\u201d You can know that at 18. So I think they\u2019ve bought into that. And I think we have the right players around them. Lou [Williams] and Pat [Beverley] and Gal [Gallinari] do not give them a break. If they mess up something from walk-through, I don\u2019t have to say a lot. They\u2019ve already heard. And I think that has helped them all. SA : What do you like about this lineup now compared to the one that began the season? DR : It\u2019s fast. It\u2019s more athletic. Since the trade, our team is deeper, which obviously we didn\u2019t know that was gonna happen. We didn\u2019t know Sham was going to be as good as he is. And JaMychal and Zub. We ended up getting the right pieces. Put \u2018em together, obviously they\u2019re very fast. They fit. They play together. it\u2019s been great. SA : Did it bother you that the initial public reaction to the moves was \u201cThe Clippers must be tanking?\u201d  DR : I wasn\u2019t bothered because I knew we were not. Now I didn\u2019t know if we could do this, I didn\u2019t know if we could win. [But] everybody we brought in here fits our DNA. SA : You decided to hold out Williams and Beverley against the Bucks, which surely didn\u2019t improve your chances of closing out the road trip at 4-0. As an old-school guy \u2013 this is your 20th season as an NBA head coach \u2013 was it difficult to accept the idea of healthy scratches? DR : I\u2019ve never come around to it. I just do it. Really, I don\u2019t even try to figure it out. I never fought it, I can say that. I figure, it\u2019s here. It is what it is. All [fighting it] is going to do is bring anxiety to me. We were not taught that as players or built that way. We wanted to play. When guys were hurt, we looked forward to it, because that meant we played all game. That\u2019s how it was and it\u2019s just different now. And that\u2019s fine. Every once in a while, I\u2019ve had some disagreements over practice. You\u2019ve had a day off and then the next day, they\u2019ll tell you that no one can practice. I\u2019ve had a little problem with that. But other than that, I\u2019m fine with it. SA : Have you resisted any of the trends in recent years, such as sleep studies, nutrition, travel demands and so on? DR : Nah, I\u2019ve been pretty good. I think me and Nate [McMillan, Pacers coach] \u2013 we hired a sleep doctor in Boston \u2013 were the guys to do that. I just know what I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always been willing. Even as a player, I was doing acupuncture. I\u2019ve always been a guy who says, \u201cLet\u2019s try it.\u201d But do it with open eyes. If it\u2019s not working, then we\u2019ll adjust. All of it is not good. But some of it is good. If you played on all analytics and no feel, that\u2019s not good. Like I\u2019ve always believed, you use them all as tools. Sometimes I do the right things, sometimes I do the wrong things. You just keep going. SA : You know baseball. Analytics serve that sport well because it is a series of 1-on-1 confrontations. In other sports, players\u2019 performances are more interdependent. DR : Baseball is perfect for analytics. But it\u2019s still feel. There have been many managers that analytically should have brought in this guy. Tommy Lasorda never should have brought in Kirk Gibson [to famously pinch hit in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series] but he had a feel that Gibson could hit [Dennis] Eckersley, and he ended up winning the World Series. I think it still goes back to both. Analytics, you look at the numbers. And every once in a while, you say, \u201cI\u2019m playing this guy tonight anyway.\u201d SA : I might as well ask now, why Dick Allen? Why was he your favorite player? [Allen, a Hall of Fame-worthy slugger, won the 1972 American League MVP while playing for Rivers\u2019 favorite team, the Chicago White Sox. The future NBA coach was 11 years old, growing up in suburban Maywood, Ill.] DR : I just loved him, I don\u2019t know why. He was the one I had on my wall from the time I was a kid. I would say, he had that gigantic bat, a 40-ounce bat, and I just loved him. SA : You\u2019ve already made it clear you think your guy Lou Williams should win the league\u2019s Sixth Man award again. Where do you stand on Coach of the Year? DR : I stay out of that. I think the great thing is, if there\u2019s a debate, that means there\u2019s a lot of good coaches in the league right now. Nate McMillan has done an amazing job. Bud [Milwaukee\u2019s Mike Budenholzer] has done a great job here. The guy in Sacramento [Dave Joerger] has done a great job. Kenny Atkinson\u2019s done a great job [in Brooklyn]. Steve Clifford in Orlando, no one gives any credit too \u2013 he\u2019s done an amazing job. SA : Have we seen the end of coaches serving as their teams\u2019 chief basketball officers as well? You, Budenholzer, Stan Van Gundy and Tom Thibodeau no longer wear two hats or, in some cases, even one. DR : It\u2019ll come back. It always does. It was too much for me, I can tell you that. I thought it took away from what I do well. And that\u2019s coach. It just felt like you were never doing all one thing. I think some people can handle it well, but I think you need a lot of help. My biggest issue was, we only had four or five guys in the front office at the time. Now we have, like, 30. But I got it the first year that [Clippers owner] Steve [Ballmer] was there and he didn\u2019t know yet, we hadn\u2019t hired anybody. Still, I think for me, I like the position I\u2019m in. I\u2019m coaching the team and yet I have my say in the front office. You just want to be in step with whoever you\u2019re working with. SA : Most NBA coaches have a say in personnel, don\u2019t they? DR : Not as many as you think. The successful teams are in step between front office and coaching staff. The unsuccessful teams? Probably not. It\u2019s tough, because if you\u2019re not on the same page with your front office\u2026 Danny Ainge and I, every decision we made, we did it together. Danny wouldn\u2019t give me a player I didn\u2019t want. We had many disagreements. Sometimes I\u2019d say, \u2018All right, I\u2019ll go with you.\u2019 Sometimes Danny would say, \u2018I think we\u2019re making a mistake but I\u2019ll roll with you.\u2019 And then we\u2019d go to dinner or go golfing. And that\u2019s what made us so good in Boston. The good thing with Lawrence [Frank, Clippers president of basketball operations] is that I\u2019m the one who brought Lawrence in as a coach. SA : You coined a word this season \u2013 \u201cunstatable\u201d \u2013 to describe Avery Bradley, for all the things he does that aren\u2019t captured by statistics. With him gone, who\u2019s your most unstatable player? DR : Pat Beverley is unstatable, for sure. And I won\u2019t take credit \u2013 it was [assistant coach Rex Kalamian\u2019s] word. He thought it actually was a word. The difference is, I went to Marquette and I understood that it was not an actual word. We had some hats made up for Rex and now he thinks it\u2019s a word again. But no, we had a game maybe a month ago where [Beverley] didn\u2019t score but was a plus-22. He was an 0-fer for the game. He is as unstatable as anyone in the league. You really can\u2019t quantify what he does at times. Analytically sometimes it looks like he had a bad defensive game, but he had a great one. He gives us our heart and our soul, for sure. SA : Your time coaching your son Austin with the Clippers generated headlines, but you have been involved with sports parenting in general, particularly as a national advisory board member for the Positive Coaches Alliance. You\u2019ve boiled some of your advice down to the most basic, encouraging people to tell their kids: \u201cGreat job, keep working.\u201d Where are we at these days in terms of parents whose kids participate? DR : I\u2019ve been a parent. I\u2019ve been around that whole AAU thing for way too long. My daughter plays volleyball. My three boys all played AAU basketball. It needs to get better in a quick way. The parents in the crowd think they\u2019re all coaches. They just need to be parents and support their kids. It\u2019s just at an all-time low right now. We\u2019ve got to get that back. SA : Somewhat related, some folks got upset when they saw Michigan State coach Tom Izzo earlier in the 2019 NCAA tournament go \u201ctoo hard\u201d at one of his players. What did you make of the reactions? DR : Yeah, that\u2019s ridiculous. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now. Everything is scrutinized. But we\u2019re teaching these kids and these adults accountability. It\u2019s really important. You don\u2019t get a trophy for finishing fifth in the NBA or sixth or seventh or eighth. There\u2019s only one. It starts early. We have to teach our kids how to win and how to lose, and how to prepare to win and do it right. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. SA : Tell me about your first car. DR : It was a Volkswagen Rabbit [laughing] my rookie year in the NBA [in 1983-84]. I bought a Rabbit and everybody laughed. I remember pulling in for camp and Dominque [Wilkins] and those guys were like, \u2018You\u2019re in the NBA and you\u2019re driving a Volkswagen?\u2019 I kept it for two years. SA : What\u2019s your go-to song or go-to musical artist? DR : For a long time it was \u201cMan in the Mirror\u201d by Michael Jackson. Loved that song. But it\u2019s probably some love song by Luther Vandross, any of his songs. SA : How much longer do you think you want to do this, and when will you know that\u2019s enough? DR : I don\u2019t know. It goes in ebbs and flows. My last year in Boston, I thought I was just going to walk away. Then I came here and a year ago, I was about to walk away. Then last year, I kind of got a rebirth. New life. I\u2019m going to do it as long as I love it. Then hopefully I can walk away and be healthy. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Neither team faced world-beaters, though the Warriors\u2019 opponent (Charlotte) had playoff aspirations at stake that Denver\u2019s opposition (Washington) had forfeited weeks ago. Yet it was Golden State demolishing the playoff-hopeful Hornets 137-90 , while the Nuggets suffered a shocking 95-90 letdown to the lottery-bound Wizards. The Warriors cruised despite just 11 minutes action from DeMarcus Cousins, who was ejected after his errant elbow to Willy Hernangomez\u2019s face earned him a Flagrant 2. Even with Cousins gone and a quietly content Kevin Durant (11 points, nine assists), Golden State jumped out to a 22-point halftime lead thanks to the Splash Triplets of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Quinn Cook. The trio combined for 70 points, including a 16-for-23 showing from beyond the arc. The Warriors scored more than 30 points in every quarter while simultaneously holding the Hornets below that mark. Three states over, where Denver enjoys a conference-best 31-6 record at Pepsi Center, the Nuggets couldn\u2019t get themselves untracked outside of Nikola Jokic (23 points, 14 rebounds). Yet even the Joker had a rough night. First there was his nose morphing into a bloody fountain: Then Bobby Portis decided to turn a hard foul into a prolonged hug at Jokic\u2019s expense: By the time the night was over, the Nuggets were no doubt glad to see the last of the Wizards in the Mile High City. The loss did far more damage to Denver\u2019s hopes of securing the No. 1 seed out West, where they now trail Golden State by a full game with just six remaining. The Nuggets no doubt lament fizzling on the same day Golden State submitted a demolition derby on national television. The perceived gap between the two teams has been far greater than that in the standings for most of the season. Denver is no doubt eager to diminish both on Tuesday when the Nuggets and Warriors play under the TNT spotlight with a potential tiebreaker, the top spot in the standings and a possible mental edge at stake. The last nine weeks have provided Trae Young supporters all the proof they need to back their man, both in general and in a Kia Rookie of the Year race that seemed over months ago. The Hawks\u2019 young guard added to the portfolio on Sunday with his second game-winner in as many weeks, a ridiculously intuitive push shot as time expired to give Atlanta the 136-135 victory over East-leading Milwaukee. Reminder: The Horry Scale breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. DIFFICULTY: Like many entries in the dunk contest or simple layups in traffic, a slow-motion replay is the best way to appreciate Young\u2019s last-second heroics. Live-ball situations are the most difficult to read, let alone react to in timely fashion. Young does both in less than a second while 1) catching the ball with his left hand; 2) switching to his right; 3) evading the outstretched defense of George Hill; and 4) releasing the ball before exhausting the same jump he launched to begin the play. This isn\u2019t something you can practice. It\u2019s instinct and touch coming together in a literal split0-second of NBA action. GAME SITUATION:  The Hawks will take every confidence-inflating breath to come with victory. That being said, almost nothing rode on this game. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe were all no-go\u2019s for the NBA\u2019s best team, which even after the loss boasts a three-game lead over second-place Toronto. CELEBRATION: Do we dock Young for his teammates\u2019 initial lack of response? His game-winner was met by a vacuum of space and a startling absence of mob-forming, chest-bumping Hawks. Even after Young admirably crows to his adoring fans, he walks several steps down the court before one teammate gives him a well-deserved bear hug. GRADE: Young\u2019s crunch-time chops are already a thing, something no one would have predicted just three short months ago. Yet the game\u2019s lack of import and post-shot euphoria left a lot to be desired when it comes to the overall magic of buzzer-beaters. 2.0 Horrys . Four playoff-bound teams \u2014 Milwaukee, Oklahoma City , San Antonio and Denver \u2014 lost to lottery squads, with the latter three providing unintentional help to the rest of the Western Conference. Once the dust settled : The basketball and popular music worlds share the same orbit, so it\u2019s no wonder that the NBA mourned the loss of Grammy-nominated rapper Nipsey Hussle. The 33-year-old was shot outside his Los Angeles store Sunday afternoon, prompting countless heartfelt expressions of grief and gratitude for the longtime NBA fan turned music star. Many NBA stars knew of and appreciated Hussle\u2019s climb from a bleak upbringing to an adult life of success and hope. Their teams, aware of the effect his loss would have on their players and the community in general, played Hussle\u2019s music during their respective games while capturing moments of reflection following his death. https:\/\/turner.slack.com\/archives\/GF7L87BMG\/p1554092686005600 If you thought Gregg Popovich would relax after the Spurs clinched their NBA-record 22nd playoff berth on Saturday, you need to watch more Spurs basketball. An assured postseason appearance and a lottery opponent mean nothing when it comes to what the five-time champion coach considers bad calls. There are countless reasons why former Spurs gush about the franchise\u2019s family atmosphere. Here\u2019s one: Popovich protects them as vociferously as any youth sports parent. Just as impressive to this audience of one: his unruffled exit as soon as he felt the tirade had run its course."},{"id":34635,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-responds-nipsey-hussle-death","date":"2019-04-01","title":"NBA players mourn death of rapper Nipsey Hussle","content":"Rapper Nipsey Hussle, whose 2018 album Victory Lap was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, died Sunday after a shooting in his native Los Angeles.

That\u2019s where the month of March appeared to be headed for the Toronto Raptors, anyway, until the NBA schedule makers gifted them near the end with even more docile sheep to be shorn. The Raptors were bumping along at a decidedly ordinary 6-6 in March, and 8-7 post-All Star break, before closing out the month against Chicago, New York and the Bulls again. Toronto won those games Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday by an average of 19 points, calming some in their fan base and restoring order to their late season. With a handful of games remaining, the Raptors seem securely slotted into the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference\u2019s playoff bracket, behind Milwaukee yet beyond the reach of Philadelphia. What came before wasn\u2019t impressive but, to hear Raptors coach Nick Nurse and his players tell it, neither was it cause for alarm. There were multiple factors at work, from injury absences and the residue of some that had come before, to games that slipped away (think Jeremy Lamb\u2019s halfcourt stunner for Charlotte), to tinkering with lineups and defensive tactics that had Nurse\u2019s team adapting on the fly. Guard Fred VanVleet was candid. \u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t play so well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last week-and-a-half we\u2019ve been better. We lost some games we shouldn\u2019t have dropped. Jeremy Lamb\u2019s shot. We lost to OKC pretty much in a back-to-back, right? We played those guys two times in about 38 hours. We\u2019ve just got to play better.\u201d Gasol, 34, had played the first 769 games of his NBA career with the Grizzlies. But with the trade, he\u2019s headed back to the playoffs after missing twice in the past three seasons. \u201cI never imagined this [move], but once it happens, you embrace it and you put everything you\u2019ve got into it,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cYou try not to chew too much at a time. It always works out, if you come in with the right mindset. If you make the right plays, if you play unselfish on both ends of the floor, it normally works out.\u201d The Raptors want to run with that thought. Perhaps because they\u2019ve been in the Bucks\u2019 shadow much of this season, or maybe because they\u2019ve lacked some of the hiccups, drama and impatience in Boston or Philadelphia, they haven\u2019t generated much chatter of late. Has overlooking Toronto, in a LeBron-less East, become a thing? \u201cHope so,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a great thing, to be under the radar. Go in and handle our business. It doesn\u2019t matter, the hoopla and \u2018respect,\u2019 you can never win that battle. You just continue to go out there and do your job. \u201cOnly one team can win the Finals. For that to be us? If we get to that point, we\u2019ll get all the respect and love we could ever want.\u201d Said Nurse before Saturday\u2019s 124-101 victory over the Bulls: \u201cI just think \u2013 I\u2019ve said this for a few weeks now \u2013 the league gets strange after the trade deadline. A lot of bottom teams out of the playoffs have been beating the best teams. Scores have been strange all over the place. Different motivations for guys playing, guys in and out of the lineup. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of injuries, guys in and out, and that affects your rhythm once in a while. And there was a game or two that got away from us near the end.\u201d Nurse has gone a little mad-scientist with his personnel too. At United Center this weekend, he decided to give high-energy forward Pascal Siakam a \u201cload management\u201d night, only the second missed game all season for arguably the favorite for the KIA NBA Most Improved Player award. Siakam was active merely as insurance had Toronto\u2019s G League cavalry \u2013 Jordan Loyd and Chris Boucher \u2013 not completed a New York-to-Chicago trek in time, following the Raptors 905 game on Long Island. Sitting Siakam gave Nurse the opportunity to start Marc Gasol alongside Serge Ibaka, a jumbo pairing that might come in handy if the Raptors face Detroit (Andre Drummond-Blake Griffin) or Boston (Aron Baynes-Al Horford) in the playoffs. Add Siakam to that mix and Toronto would be posting a defensive \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign at the rim. Nurse was happy with the results: 23 points and 12 rebounds from Ibaka in 28 minutes; 17 points, eight boards and six assists from Gasol in 29. And as often happens when Leonard doesn\u2019t play \u2013 he did not travel to Chicago, excused for personal reasons \u2013 the offense was more equitable, as well as more crisp. Thirty-four assists to 11 turnovers. Leonard, the franchise-altering free agent to be who thus gets favored-nation status from Toronto\u2019s brass, now has missed 22 games this season: six for injuries, one for personal and 15 as a healthy scratch. The team has gone 37-18 with him, 17-5 without him. When Leonard skips, Nurse typically slides Danny Green to forward and starts both VanVleet and Kyle Lowry in the backcourt. That leads to a faster pace, more penetration and more assists, along with the All-Star wing\u2019s 19 shots on average to divvy up among teammates. Without the \u201ccalculating, halfcourt\u201d player, as Nurse calls Leonard, and the iso possessions at which he excels, Toronto moves the ball and moves its guys more. Nurse used his 22nd different starting lineup Saturday. The Raptors are 13-1 when both point guards start. \u201cIt\u2019s more about committee,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cKawhi is a guy who can just bail you out with his individual skills. We use him as a primary scorer, and put him in a lot of ball screens and pin-down actions to get a bucket by himself. When he\u2019s not there, I think it\u2019s more opportunity for everybody else. Obviously we lean on him a lot in the fourth. Just got to find a way \u2013 guys have done a good job of spacing and stepping up and making plays.\u201d That includes Gasol, who has been his effective self (per-36 stats that nearly mirror his career numbers) while logging fewer minutes. Toronto is 14-7 since acquiring the 11th-year veteran. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting, right, because he\u2019s been great and not really scoring much,\u201d Nurse said. \u201c[Against Boston in February] he had one point \u2013 and eight assists. Obviously he\u2019s a great passer and it\u2019s enabled [us] to get downhill via the pass for maybe the first time in my six years there. We\u2019re getting a lot of back-door baskets. Seems like we have a lot more cutting going on. Guys are more motivated to cut harder because they\u2019ll get it back at the end a little bit.\u201d Gasol, 34, had played the first 769 games of his NBA career with the Grizzlies. But with the trade, he\u2019s headed back to the playoffs after missing twice in the past three seasons. \u201cI never imagined this [move], but once it happens, you embrace it and you put everything you\u2019ve got into it,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cYou try not to chew too much at a time. It always works out, if you come in with the right mindset. If you make the right plays, if you play unselfish on both ends of the floor, it normally works out.\u201d The Raptors want to run with that thought. Perhaps because they\u2019ve been in the Bucks\u2019 shadow much of this season, or maybe because they\u2019ve lacked some of the hiccups, drama and impatience in Boston or Philadelphia, they haven\u2019t generated much chatter of late. Has overlooking Toronto, in a LeBron-less East, become a thing? \u201cHope so,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a great thing, to be under the radar. Go in and handle our business. It doesn\u2019t matter, the hoopla and \u2018respect,\u2019 you can never win that battle. You just continue to go out there and do your job. \u201cOnly one team can win the Finals.

I\u2019m not quite sure anyone actually \u201cenjoys\u201d people rooting against them, but if anyone embraces it more than Jimmy Butler \u2026 I\u2019ve yet to see it outside the squared circle. The trade demand. The third-team-vs.-the-starters practice. Joining a \u201cBig Three\u201d that\u2019s now a \u201cBig Four.\u201d Absolutely rocking the Timberwolves in round one. And then, the return. Outfitted with custom kicks quoting The Dark Night while the Minnesota PA blared Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d Butler brought on the boos with his mere presence. And oh, was he ready. I mean, look at this: From there, the Sixers\u2019 jumped out to a 21-point lead. The Timberwolves\u2019 reserves gradually cut it all the way down to three with just over five minutes to play, but Minnesota never truly threatened. Butler, though he shot 4-of-17, finished with 12 points, 13 rebounds, five assists and two steals in a 118-109 victory. \u201cI\u2019m glad we came in here and did what we were supposed to do to get a rhythm moving forward,\u201d Butler said. \u201cHome, away, whoever it\u2019s against, I\u2019m solid. I\u2019m cool.\u201d Minnesota is out of the playoffs. Philadelphia is likely locked into the East\u2019s No. 3 seed. Butler seems to have acclimated. The playoffs are where we see if Butler hits his winning window. And then the summer, when there\u2019s the chance for the financial payoff, likely dependent on that playoff performance. As with everything Butler, it\u2019s only going to be interesting. James Harden is spoiling us. Seriously. In Saturday\u2019s victory over the Kings, one that sent Sacramento fishing and clinched playoff spots for the Thunder and Spurs, James Harden dropped a 50-point triple-double. For the second time this season. For the fifth time in his career. That cements Harden as the all-time leader in that specific category, ahead of Russell Westbrook (3), as well as Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain (2). It was the ninth 50-pointer of Harden\u2019s season \u2014 just one off Kobe\u2019s post-merger record from 2006-07 \u2014 and 18th of his career. His scoring average is up to 36.4. Ridiculous that he\u2019s still nodding this thing north. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable what he does, and he does it every night,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cI keep thinking: \u2018Gosh, can he do this every game?\u2019 And then he does it for three years.\u201d Further down the Eastern Confernce standings, a multi-team melee is in full force for the final three spots. The Nets, Pistons, Magic and Heat all won Saturday, just 1.5 games separate sixth-place Detroit from ninth-place Miami, while the Hornets loom just 2.0 games further back. The most notable single performance was D\u2019Angelo Russell popping off for 20 third-quarter points, turning a close game against the Celtics into a rout that could prove crucial. It also earned a shoutout from a very prominent, very enthused fan. \u201cI told you, man, every [win] is going to be worth it,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe need it, scratching and clawing for every one of them.\u201d Nice team wins for Orlando (who have won 7 of 8 and are 18-8 since Jan. 31) and Detroit (13-7 since the All-Star break) as well; the former knocked off Eastern foe Indiana, the latter, inter-conference opponent Portland. Almost a bummer only three of these squads get in right as they all seem to be figuring it out. Two points! That\u2019s all that separated Suns guard Devin Booker from an exclusive list after he finished Saturday\u2019s loss to the Grizzlies with 48 points, denied his third straight 50-point showing by half-court traps and diminishing returns. Had Booker achieved the mark, it would\u2019ve placed him alongside Chamberlain, Jordan and Kobe as the only players to have done so. Full stop. That\u2019s a thing! Also a thing: Losses in all three games for Phoenix, though that speaks more to a lack of help than any failing on Booker\u2019s part; he\u2019s shooting 54-of-92 (61.9%) while carrying a turnover ratio right in line with his season mark despite the usage spike. Small sample size theater, but in those three games, Phoenix\u2019s offensive rating is 114.9 with Booker on the floor (Golden State\u2019s league-leading mark is 114.7). In the 23 minutes without him, it\u2019s 64.8. Good grief. Also of note, 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton exited early with what the team termed a left ankle sprain. Expect an update on that one sometime Sunday. As noted, now that the Kings won\u2019t be challenging in this year\u2019s Game of (NBA) Thrones, the Western Conference playoff field is set. Here\u2019s a look: There are, at this point, essentially three races: We\u2019ll see how it shakes out over these final two weeks. And then? Mayhem. Dwyane Wade\u2019s final spin through the league took its bow at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, where the fans showered one of the greats with a gracious ovation: \u201cAs a player, this is your last time and just want to enjoy it,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI know the fans stayed around and that was so cool, man, to be able to have that. You expect it at home maybe your last time but on the road you don\u2019t expect that.\u201d Knicks coach David Fizdale, who coached Wade as an assistant with the Heat from 2008-16, praised \u201cone of the greatest guards that\u2019s ever played this game\u201d afterward, citing Wade\u2019s loyalty and friendship above all else. That said, even this #OneLastDance has its limits, and Emmanuel Mudiay caught an unfortunate L on a last-minute request. With the 30th anniversary of Detroit\u2019s 1989 championship approaching, the Pistons marked the occasion at halftime of Saturday\u2019s 99-90 victory over Portland."},{"id":34690,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ayton-sprains-left-ankle-against-grizzlies","date":"2019-03-31","title":"Ayton sprains left ankle against Grizzlies","content":" Suns rookie Deandre Ayton sprained his left ankle late in the third quarter of Saturday\u2019s game with the Grizzlies and did not return.

Each night brings new developments to the playoff picture . More changes were bound to happen on a six-game slate featuring at least one playoff contender in all of them. So, let\u2019s look at \u201cwho won and who lost. All that.\u201d And then some. Timberwolves 131, Warriors 130 OT The most eventful game \u2014 and finish; more on that below \u2014 of the night came in Minnesota, where the Timberwolves held on in overtime to shock Golden State. At 51-24, the Warriors are again tied with Denver for first place in the Western Conference. (The Warriors do hold the tiebreaker, thanks to their 2-1 head-to-head record.) Celtics 114, Pacers 112 No team has clinched a specific seed, so no matchups have officially been locked. However, you can virtually assume that Indiana and Boston will face off in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Who will hold home court is the question that looms, an advantage the Celtics now claim after Kyrie Irving\u2019s game-winner moved them ahead of the Pacers and into fourth place. Both teams meet again on April 5, when Indiana will attempt to even the season series. Nuggets 115, Thunder 105 Oklahoma City sat just two games behind Denver for the No. 2 spot in the West at the All-Star break. On Friday, the Nuggets knocked off the Thunder and pushed their Northwest division foe down to eighth place. It was another potential playoff matchup, one Oklahoma City should hope to avoid after being swept by Denver in the regular season. The Nuggets again moved into a tie with the Warriors for first in the West, while simultaneously denying the Thunder a chance to clinch a playoff berth. Trail Blazers 118, Atlanta 98 The Trail Blazers are now riding a league-best six-game winning streak. It\u2019s been two games since they lost starting center Jusuf Nurkic to a gruesome leg injury. The Blazers have convincingly won both contests \u2014 oddly enough, by the same 118-98 score \u2014 but given that they\u2019ve both come against lottery-bound teams, it\u2019s still unclear what life will be like in the postseason. At the very least, Portland moved a half game ahead of Houston for third in the West. Jazz 128, Wizards 124 Donovan Mitchell dropped 35 points to lift Utah to its ninth win in the last 10 games. The Jazz still have a chance, albeit a slim one, at attaining home court in the Western Conference\u2019s first round, sitting two games behind the Rockets for fourth place with six games remaining. Lakers 129, Hornets 115 Kemba Walker has yet to win a game when going head to head against LeBron James \u2014 not once in the regular season, playoffs or even All-Star Game. That combined 0-for-29 drought continued at Staples Center as Los Angeles pulled away from Charlotte. The Hornets, however, are the team that still has playoff hopes, which took a hit after their road setback. Charlotte is now two games behind Miami for the final playoff spot in the East with seven games remaining. Wolves win after wild finish  When the clock hit zero in the Timberwolves\u2019 win over the Warriors, you could already hear the cacophony of complaints that would emanate from the Golden State locker room. The Warriors used terms like \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cmind-boggling\u201d to describe the officiating in their 131-130 loss, a game that included two late calls that didn\u2019t go in their favor. With 4.4 seconds remaining and Golden State down 130-127, referee Marat Kogut blew his whistle as Kevin Durant drilled what appeared to be the game-tying 3-pointer. Kogut, however, ruled that Durant had been fouled before beginning his shooting motion. The Warriors tempered their frustration and inbounded the ball to Stephen Curry on the next possession, when he sank the game-tying triple from the corner with less than a second remaining. Double overtime appeared to be in the works, but the additional extra period never occurred as more drama unfolded: Durant was called for a foul after holding Towns on the ensuing inbound pass with just 0.5 seconds left. Towns then hit the first of two free throws to seal the win. Afterwards, Durant called Kogut \u201cthe best player on the floor tonight,\u201d while Curry sarcastically dubbed Kogut \u201cthe MVP of tonight.\u201d It should be noted that a different official, Leon Wood, whistled Durant for the foul on Towns. Durant\u2019s assessment of the call: \u201cLeon, you just gotta get out the way at that point.\u201d Durant and Curry might soon be getting out their checkbooks. Lillard vs. Young  Lillard poured in 36 points and seven assists in a matchup between two of the hottest offenses since the All-Star break. Portland ranked first in offensive efficiency and Atlanta led the league in points per game coming into Friday\u2019s contest. A substantial amount of that success is due to the play of each team\u2019s point guard. Lillard\u2019s counterpart, Kia Rookie of the Year candidate Trae Young, continued his blazing form with 26 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in the loss. The two playmakers staged an intriguing duel in State Farm Arena. Both of them scored 18 points in the first half \u2014 numbers that encapsulate how similar their stats have looked since the All-Star break. Here\u2019s a comparison snapshot heading into Friday\u2019s matchup. The Hawks 20-year-old rookie is putting up numbers equal to an All-NBA star. He\u2019s progressed tremendously since his rough start to season, and he\u2019s certainly progressed since this photograph was taken: Lillard says Young was in eighth grade at the time of the picture, and he praised the first-year phenom after the game. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a beginning of the season and right now,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cI think it shows that he\u2019s a smart point guard. He\u2019s figuring things out. You\u2019re seeing his true confidence. You\u2019re seeing his basketball IQ, and his feel for the game is showing up late in the season.\u201d  Speaking of point guards \u2026"},{"id":34688,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/celtics-statement-cousins-fan","date":"2019-03-29","title":"Celtics give two-year ban to fan for comments toward Cousins","content":"On January 26, we were alerted by DeMarcus Cousins that a fan had used racially offensive language towards him.

We continue with the Kia Defensive Player of the Year Award. This isn\u2019t a case for or against any particular player. It\u2019s just a dive into some of the relevant numbers for consideration. * * * More articles from this series: Steals and blocks certainly aren\u2019t the best measure of defense, but the former is an indication a player\u2019s activity on the perimeter and the latter is an indication of a player\u2019s ability to protect the rim. The top 20 players in steals + blocks per game includes the five guys \u2013 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner \u2013 that will probably get most of the Defensive Player of the Year votes, as well as former winners Draymond Green and Kawhi Leonard. It also includes four guys \u2013 Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jrue Holiday and Karl-Anthony Towns \u2013 that play for worse-than-average defensive teams. Here are the top 20, with how many points per 100 possessions their teams have allowed with them on the floor and where that ranks among the 198 players who have averaged at least 20 minutes in 50 games or more . A look at the leaders in on-off DefRtg differential (how a team has performed defensively with a player on the floor vs. off the floor) makes you realize that reserves get to defend other reserves. The only full-time starters in the top 20 are Chris Paul, J.J. Redick (who plays most of his minutes with Embiid), Rudy Gay, Joe Ingles (who plays most of his minutes with Gobert) and Embiid himself. But George ranks 27th, highest among all Thunder players that have played at least 1,000 minutes, with OKC having been 4.0 points per 100 possessions better defensively with him on the floor than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor. Antetokounmpo ranks 70th ( -1.8 ), Turner ranks 95th ( -0.6 ), and Gobert ranks 108th ( the Jazz have allowed 102.8 points per 100 possessions with him both on and off the floor ). The leaders in deflections per game are mostly the same guys atop the steals leaderboard. Leonard is a couple of spots higher, though. None of the five DPOY candidates named above rank in the top 50 in charges drawn per game . In fact the five \u2013 Antetokounmpo (1), Embiid (1), George (5), Gobert (4) and Turner (1) \u2013 have combined to draw just 12 charges all season. Gobert doesn\u2019t rank as the best rim protector on his own team, but opponents have still shot just 53.1 percent at the rim when he\u2019s been there, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Embiid (54.1 percent) and Turner (55.9 percent) also rank among the top 15 rim protectors . There\u2019s more to rim protection than just defending the shots that are taken near the rim. There\u2019s also preventing those shots from being attempted in the first place. Shots in the restricted area are the most valuable shots on the floor. As a whole, the league shoots 63 percent in the restricted area, a value of 1.26 points per shot. And as a whole, the league takes 33 percent of its shots in the restricted area. Preventing those shots is partly about a team\u2019s defensive scheme. Only 26 percent of Milwaukee\u2019s opponents\u2019 shots have come from the restricted area when Brook Lopez has been on the floor. That\u2019s the lowest rate among the 340 players who have been on the floor for at least 1,000 opponent field goal attempts. And it\u2019s lower than the Bucks\u2019 opponent rate when Lopez has been off the floor (30 percent). The Bucks\u2019 rim protection (and, in turn, it\u2019s top-ranked defense) is about both scheme and personnel. Embiid, Gobert and Green have similar on-off differentials in regard to preventing shots in the restricted area. Turner, however, does not. Indiana opponents have taken a greater percentage of their shots in the restricted area while he\u2019s been on the floor than they have while he\u2019s been off the floor. Antetokounmpo doesn\u2019t protect the rim as often as Lopez , but he affects shots all over the floor. According to Second Spectrum tracking, opponents have shot just 40.6 percent when Antetokounmpo has been the closest defender, 6.2 percentage points lower than their average on those shots . For George, that number is 44.1 percent (1.6 percentage points lower than average). And a run-through of other perimeter defenders with defensive reputations \u2026 \u2026 doesn\u2019t produce any differential close to that of Antetokounmpo. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

That\u2019s the fear Milwaukee Bucks fans are living through these days with injuries plaguing the roster of the NBA\u2019s best team on a seemingly nightly basis. And that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks\u2019 Kia MVP candidate and frontrunner (for many), who suffered a scare Thursday night when he ran into Garrett Temple late in a thumping of the Los Angeles Clippers. Antetokounmpo tweaked his right ankle , the same one that he sprained against Philadelphia and cost him two games last week, and didn\u2019t finish the game. He worked the Clippers for 34 points and nine rebounds before exiting, but the bigger issue remains for the Bucks and the Greek Freak. In a skin-tight chase for the Kia MVP, will the Bucks have to choose between keeping Antetokounmpo healthy for the postseason over allowing him to run through the tape in his neck-and-neck race with reigning Kia MVP James Harden? Antetokounmpo\u2019s ambition is to take care of both tasks, as he made clear after the win over the Clippers, even though the ultimate decision could and probably should be made by Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer and the team\u2019s medical staff. \u201cI think the coaching staff, Bud and the medical staff have done a great job knowing when to pull me away from a game,\u201d Antetokounmpo told reporters. \u201cI trust them. It doesn\u2019t matter if I am going through pain or I don\u2019t feel good. I am always prepared to play the game. There are going to be some days I am going to play with pain. There\u2019s going to be a lot of days I\u2019m stubborn and saying I want to go play, but Coach Bud is like, \u2018No, you are not going to play.\u2019\u201d If there was any doubt as to Antetokounmpo\u2019s focus this season, put it to rest. He\u2019s locked in on the Bucks\u2019 playoff potential and their procurement of the No. 1 overall seed and home court advantage that accompanies it throughout the entire postseason. But he\u2019s human. He also knows how tantalizingly close he is to crossing one of his individual goals off of his list. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it doesn\u2019t mean anything to me,\u201d Antetokounmpo told The Athletic recently . \u201cIt\u2019s one of my goals as a player to one day be the MVP of this league, but I\u2019m not going to go into the discussions. \u2018Giannis said this. James said that. Paul George said whatever. (Nikola) Jokic said this.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to go in a back-and-forth discussion. I don\u2019t want to say anything.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have to. The rest of us will take care of that for him, sorting out the details of each campaign. The reality is the Bucks are solid in the standings. They\u2019ve built some separation there that should hold up over the final two weeks of the season. But in that other race, the one that Antetokounmpo might have to win in a photo finish, there is no cushion \u2026 and therefore, no room for a late-season stumble. Not even from the frontrunner. * * * The top five this week in the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 2 Season stats :  27.4 points, 12.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.3 blocks The Bucks have a nice break before Sunday\u2019s game against an improved Atlanta team, a break that will provide a couple of days for Antetokounmpo to let his tender right ankle rest a bit. They\u2019ll take a four-game win streak with them to Atlanta, having secured quality wins over Houston and the Los Angeles Clippers in their two most recent outings. Antetokounmpo had an opportunity to go head-to-head with reigning Kia MVP James Harden in the win over the Rockets, but neither of the frontrunners for the top spot this season made a mark significant enough to sway any potential swing voters. Their base constituencies would argue that the cases have already been made. Giannis has continued to grind his way to the finish, bumps and bruises be darned, as the unquestioned best player on the best team in the league from wire to wire. It\u2019s a metric that has worked like a charm in years past where MVP voting is concerned. Harden rode that train to his first Kia MVP last season. The Greek Freak could be putting the finishing touches on his own version of the same master plan. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats :  36.2 points, 7.5 assists, 6.5 rebounds, 2.1 steals With the added emphasis that is always placed on scoring, and rightfully so, Harden\u2019s campaign for a second straight Kia MVP appears to be rock solid. Harden could finish this season having scored six more points than he did a year ago, when he led the league with a 30.4 average. Harden\u2019s scoring barrage this season has been nothing short of spectacular. The spikes, the 50- and even 60-point games, are one thing. But it\u2019s the brilliant consistency that separates Harden from the pack of scoring stars that populate the league these days. He\u2019s scored 20 or more points in 51 straight games, the third longest single-season 20-point streak since the 1983-84 season. The fact that he\u2019s delivered the Rockets from the bottom of the Western Conference standings to top four territory through adversity that would have sacked most teams in the same position, is perhaps the most impressive thing he\u2019s done. The Rockets don\u2019t sniff the top four without Harden going nuclear on a consistent basis with Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Eric Gordon and other key rotation players missing significant time with injury. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats :  27.8 points, 5.4 assists, 5.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals Years from now, when the story of the Warriors\u2019 current run is embedded in the history books as potentially the best dynasty the league has seen since the Bill Russell-led Celtics of the 1960s, there will be an even greater appreciation for what Curry has done as the backbone of what the Warriors have accomplished. It\u2019s easy to gloss over it in the midst of the run, especially when Klay Thompson and most recently Kevin Durant (near perfect shooting game in Wednesday\u2019s win over Memphis) help fuel the Warriors\u2019 spectacular parade on a nightly basis. Dare we say that Curry\u2019s contributions have been taken for grated, by some, during this era of dominance? He wouldn\u2019t be the first Kia MVP working these days to fall victim to his own wicked standard (see James, LeBron; Westbrook, Russell; Durant Kevin and Harden, James). But he might be the most surprising, given the way he plays and the way his rise to stardom has served the gateway for a championship era for an entire franchise. It\u2019s something to chew on, Curry\u2019s ability to play as well as he has two seasons removed from the second of his back-to-back Kia MVPs. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats :  27.5 points, 13.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.9 blocks Embiid is in the mood these days, eager to send messages to anyone willing to listen, that he\u2019ll be handing out consistent punishment in the postseason. He dropped that not-so-subtle message on the Brooklyn Nets Thursday night with a monster 39-point, 16-rebound and six-assist showcase against a team the Sixers could see in the first round in a couple of weeks. Embiid\u2019s 16-point first quarter set the tone for the night, and basically every night he\u2019s been on the floor since his post-All-Star break hiatus for load management. Embiid\u2019s blend of superior size, skill and overflowing confidence makes him the most dangerous individual force heading into the postseason, provided he avoids the injury issues that inevitably comes with the Embiid superstar kit at this stage of his career. For all that he\u2019s done so far, we still don\u2019t know if Embiid can raise his game to that galactic level in the playoffs that translates into a deep run into May, and perhaps June. No one is disputing that the raw materials are in place. The Sixers have a starting five built for the big stage. The only lingering question is whether or not Embiid is prepared to serve as the energy source for this group once the brightest lights come on? Last week:  No. 5 Season stats :  28.2 points 8.1 rebounds, 4.12 assists, 2.2 steals The Thunder\u2019s late-season swoon has overshadowed what\u2019s been a stellar, MVP-caliber season for George. His postseason accolades could include a spot on not only the Kia MVP list but also Defensive Player of the Year mention and, crazy as it sounds, some Most Improved ballots. George has had that sort of season. But the forces that can change things in an instant are crashing into each other at the worst time for George and the Thunder. Not only are they struggling right now, his sore right shoulder, the one that has been nagging him for weeks, could keep him out of some crucial games down the stretch of this season, including tonight\u2019s showdown against Denver  (8 ET, NBA League Pass) . And the Thunder need George at his best heading into the postseason for bottom line reasons more than they do to legitimize his status for anything that will transpire during awards season. Any rest Billy Donovan can find for George or Russell Westbrook at this stage of the season without the Thunder falling apart is a bonus. And with the certainty in the playoff standings right, there are no breaks to be had. * * * The Next Five 6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 8.

But most beloved? One could make a strong case that honor belongs to one Emanuel David Ginobili, whose flamboyance, intensity, humility and Latin American roots earned him a level of affection in San Antonio that no other player could match. That appreciation was on full display Thursday at the AT&T Center, where the Spurs\u2019 116-110 victory over the Cavaliers was merely an appetizer for the main event: The retirement of Ginobili\u2019s No. 20 . \u201cHe was unlike any other basketball player we had ever seen,\u201d former teammate Sean Elliott said during the ceremony. \u201cHe was a magician who stole your breath away.\u201d In the case of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, that often meant literally. \u201cI never cursed before I met him,\u201d Popovich joked before the game , remembering the ill-advised passes and out-of-control drives to nowhere that inspired fits of rage. But there were many more moments of brilliance, providing creativity and unpredictability to a defensive-minded Spurs team that, despite its excellence, sorely needed both. \u201cWithout Manu,\u201d Popovich said, \u201cthere were no championships (in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014).\u201d Said Duncan, \u201cIt was all genius. You saw things before anyone else did. You did things nobody else would.\u201d Ginobili\u2019s cult status in San Antonio is matched by outright deification in his native Argentina, which he led to Olympic gold in 2004 during a national career that covered nearly two decades. Add it all up, and you have one of the most unique careers in basketball, which ended with Ginobili matching Bill Bradley as the only players in hoops history to win European, Olympic and NBA championships. Not bad for a kid who grew up on the other side of the world, loving the NBA but never imagining he would be good enough to get that far, let alone be great. \u201cIt was not even a second thought,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201cNot one Argentinian in history had made it to the NBA. So why was it going to be me? There was no way me or anyone that was near me could ever envision a career like this. \u201cThe game gave me so much, I am in debt forever.\u201d So are we. Gracias, Manu. Ginobili was retired by the time DeMar DeRozan joined the Spurs last offseason. That didn\u2019t stop him from sporting some sweet Argentina-inspired kicks in his honor. Roughly 2,000 Slovenians gathered in Miami for a momentous occasion: The first NBA meeting between national heroes Goran Dragic and Luka Doncic. The two teamed up to perfection several summers ago, leading the tiny European nation to its first continental championship at EuroBasket 2017. While Dragic starred with 35 points against Serbia in the final, it was Doncic who drew headlines over the course of the tournament with his uncommonly mature game. Said Dragic after that victory: \u201cHe\u2019s a born winner. Mark my words, he\u2019s going to be one of the best in the whole world.\u201d Doncic isn\u2019t there just yet, but give the Kia Rookie of the Year contender time. He\u2019s still only 20. In the meantime, Dragic was more than happy to school his young compatriot, dropping just the second triple-double of his career with 23 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists as the Heat prevailed 105-99 . Taking a page from Dwyane Wade\u2019s book, Dragic and Doncic swapped jerseys during a warm postgame meeting. And their fellow Slovenians? They didn\u2019t want the night to end. The Bucks\u2019 championship hopes flashed before their eyes as superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo went down in a heap and limped to the locker room late in their league-leading 57th victory, over the Clippers. Antetokounmpo returned shortly thereafter and was actually getting ready to check back in before the Bucks pushed far enough ahead for coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s liking. Though Antetokounmpo wouldn\u2019t say exactly what happened, it appeared to be an aggravation of the right ankle sprain that has hampered him in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m definitely working on it, trying to get it healthy, stronger,\u201d said Antetokounmpo, who piled up 34 points, nine rebounds and five assists. \u201cUsually when you sprain your ankle, you\u2019re out three or four games. But I don\u2019t like missing games, so I have to work through it. I\u2019ll be ready to play until coach tells me not to.\u201d Budenholzer said he\u2019ll wait to see how Antetokounmpo feels in the coming days before he makes any decisions about his availability for the Bucks\u2019 next game, against the Hawks on Sunday. Jamal Murray did a pretty passable Ginobili impression with this ridiculous shot against the Rockets: Like pretty much everybody else who follows the NBA, Houston\u2019s Clint Capela never imagined Nuggets star Nikola Jokic would be this good. \u201cHe was really smart and talented,\u201d Capela said of their initial meeting at the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit, the annual showcase pitting the best junior prospects from around the world. \u201cHe had all that but to translate that to the NBA and have that much impact, I would never guess that.\u201d Capela might as well have been talking about himself after developing into one of the league\u2019s most dependable and consistent players since the Rockets took a flyer on him with the 25th pick in the 2014. The hard-working center outplayed Jokic in their latest meeting, scoring one more point (17-16) while grabbing nearly twice as many rebounds (15-8) in the Rockets\u2019 112-85 victory. It was Capela\u2019s 40th double-double of the season, good for fourth in the NBA.

You cannot begin to describe basketball without mentioning them and what they did and how many they influenced. That\u2019s the impact of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. They made teams great. But can they create great teams? That\u2019s the ongoing challenge for a pair of Mount Rushmore players who oversee the Los Angeles Lakers (Johnson) and Charlotte Hornets (Jordan) as they learn how success in one area of basketball isn\u2019t so simple in another. When the playoffs begin on April 13, there\u2019s the very real chance it will go forth without both MJs. Decades ago, this was unthinkable. As players, their teams (Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls and Johnson\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers) made the playoffs every season and were often strong title contenders. The teams they represent today have no shot at any of that. Johnson is team president of the Lakers, who were eliminated from playoff contention last Friday . The Jordan-owned Hornets are a stumble or two away from elimination, which, if it happens, will be another sign of a new normalcy for him. The Lakers haven\u2019t made the playoffs in two seasons under Johnson\u2019s watch. The Hornets made the playoffs only twice in Jordan\u2019s nine seasons as owner \u2014 and just three times in the 13 years since Jordan, previously the Hornets\u2019 president, has been in control of the franchise. At the very least, it\u2019s a humbling experience for Magic and Jordan and shows how much harder they must work to restore faith among their teams\u2019 fan bases.  Magic is just getting started, but any leeway you give must be tempered with the higher stakes he faces. Not only does he have LeBron James under contract for three more years, he\u2019s in charge of the Lakers, a proud franchise with 16 championships and a certain standard. That sense of urgency equals a reduced grace period for the relatively new team president. \u201cI\u2019m a winner, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do,\u201d Johnson said shortly after being given the franchise keys by controlling owner Jeanie Buss. That bold statement means Magic welcomes the pressure that comes with the job. He did, after all, help lead the Lakers to a title as a rookie in 1979-80 and the good times lasted over a decade with him. Of course, that was when he ran the fast break and threw no-look passes. In this job, he must judge talent, negotiate trades, oversee the scouting department and convince free agents there\u2019s no better place to be than in L.A. with the Lakers. He\u2019s also competing against astute talent evaluators and negotiators who\u2019ve been in their positions for years, individuals who have worked their way up the ranks while being well-versed in the necessary grunt work. Magic is banking heavily that by clearing salary cap space, he\u2019ll add enough talent around LeBron to make a title run. His plan isn\u2019t foolproof, however, and may backfire should he come up empty this summer. Johnson traded D\u2019Angelo Russell to the Nets in the summer of 2017 because Brooklyn agreed to take Timofey Mozgov\u2019s clunky contract in return, which was given by former Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak in 2016 . The Lakers also received a mid-round No. 1 pick in the deal, which Johnson used to take Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma plus cap space sounds great \u2026 yet unlike Kuzma, Russell is now an All-Star, leaving some Lakers fans are howling. Magic also drafted Lonzo Ball with the No. 2 pick in 2017, ahead of De\u2019Aaron Fox and Jayson Tatum. Ball may eventually become a solid player, maybe even a star and his basketball instincts are sharp (and he\u2019s only 21). But so far and for whatever it\u2019s worth right now, he\u2019s behind Fox and Tatum in development. Johnson struck out last summer in signing Paul George in free agency as George didn\u2019t even give the Lakers an interview. George chose Russell Westbrook over LeBron as a teammate and became a Kia MVP candidate this season. To keep the cap space clean this summer, Johnson signed journeymen like Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson to one-year deals. Their impact has been mixed and there wasn\u2019t a shooter in the bunch to address the Lakers\u2019 biggest weakness in 2018-19. That, plus injuries to LeBron, Ball and Brandon Ingram, destroyed the Lakers\u2019 playoff hopes this season before April, an embarrassment for the franchise. All this does is place a greater sense of urgency for Johnson this summer to make the right decisions with the Lakers\u2019 draft pick, their salary cap space and in any potential trade packages he makes for the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 Anthony Davis. Should he miss at most or all of these, the Lakers run the risk of burning through another season where they don\u2019t contend for a title with LeBron, who turns 35 in December.  Jordan is dealing with a far longer (and if not as frustrating of a) dry spell. His troubles aren\u2019t magnified because Charlotte is a small market, the Hornets aren\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar outside of there. Plus, many loyal UNC fans still remember his NCAA title-winning shot in 1982 . He\u2019s not getting the James Dolan treatment does in New York (in other words, no one is asking Jordan to sell the club). But is it too much to ask Jordan to find answers? Those questions are being asked. Since becoming owner in March of 2010, Jordan has seen two winning seasons (2013-14 and \u201915-16), burned through five coaches and is on his third general manager. His team is unlikely to have cap space until 2021 because of questionable deals given to Nicolas Batum, Cody Zeller, Michael-Kidd Gilchrist and others. So much for the perception that Jordan is tight with a buck. Instead: Is he wise with the dollars? That will be put to test this summer when he decides what to do with unrestricted free agent\/superstar guard Kemba Walker . If Walker makes an All-NBA team this season, he can make as much as $221 million over five years if the Hornets decide to give him that max contract. If he misses out on All-NBA, his ceiling with the Hornets is $189 million over five years. Other teams can offer $140 million over four years. Walker, Charlotte\u2019s all-time leading scorer, is a three-time All-Star who can score like mad. The ball-dominant guard will turn 29 next season and has won three playoff games in his eight seasons with Charlotte.  In the past, Jordan said he\u2019d be willing to pay the luxury tax if the Hornets were contenders. Well, if he pays Walker the max or anywhere near it, the Hornets will be a tax team. If he lets Walker walk, the Hornets lose a talent they\u2019ll be unable to replace right away. Jordan backed away from most personnel decisions once becoming owner. He did reportedly veto a proposal from the Boston Celtics , who offered six No. 1 picks for the first-rounder Charlotte used on Frank Kaminski (No. 9 pick, 2015). In 2014, the Hornets were reportedly offered a pair of first rounders for the No. 9 pick, which they declined and took Noah Vonleh. Drafts have been a major problem on Jordan\u2019s watch. Aside from Walker, none of those taken by the Hornets have become impact players, although the jury is still out on Malik Monk and Miles Bridges. The good news for Jordan is the Hornets are winners everywhere else. They play in a fan-friendly downtown arena, enjoy healthy home crowds and make money. Plus, Jordan paid $275 million for the club, which, per Forbes, has an estimated worth of $1.25 billion. Johnson and Jordan never need to worry about money, celebrity or their place in the game. But is it possible they can still fail at basketball? Their reputations as team builders is less certain and stable. It\u2019s a work in progress and in some ways in peril, if only because they were such great players and game-changers in another basketball life. They\u2019re suddenly pressed to make the right basketball decisions, something that never caused them or their teams to sweat long ago. Now? Strange as it sounds, Magic and Jordan could use a little luck. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

After looking at the Kia Most Improved Award , we tackle the Kia NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award. This isn\u2019t a case for or against any particular player. It\u2019s just a dive into some of the relevant numbers for consideration. * * * More articles from this series: Here are the players that lead the league in certain boxscore categories off the bench through Wednesday\u2026 Those numbers don\u2019t include any games that those players may have started (though neither Clarkson nor Williams has started a single game and Davis has started just one). Everything below includes all games that Sixth Man candidates have played. Here are the players who have averaged the most points + rebounds + assists per game among those that have played at least 1,000 minutes and started less than half of the games they\u2019ve played in. Some Sixth Man candidates (and winners) can be volume scorers. Here are the leaders in true shooting percentage (which measures scoring efficiency) among players that have taken at least 400 shots from the field and have started less than half of the games they\u2019ve played in. Williams has a true shooting percentage of 55.6 percent , which is slightly below league average (55.9 percent), but better than the average true shooting percentage for guards (54.3 percent). For a look at playmaking efficiency, here are the leaders in assist\/turnover ratio among players that have played at least 1,000 minutes and started less than half of the games they\u2019ve played in. The best reserves make an impact by helping their team outscore its opponents. Here are the sixth man candidates (those that have played at least 1,000 minutes and started less than half of the games they\u2019ve played in) with the best on-off-court differential in NetRtg (team point differential per 100 possessions). Domantas Sabonis ranks 20th here, with the Pacers having been 3.6 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-5.7) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (plus-2.1). Montrezl Harrell ranks 27th, with the Clippers having been 2.9 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-3.0) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (plus-0.1). How important a sixth man is to his team could be determined by whether or not he\u2019s on the floor down the stretch of close games. Here are the sixth man candidates who have played the most with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime . This is the one knock on Sabonis\u2019 resume. As important as Sabonis has been to the Pacers (and though he\u2019s shot 8-for-9 with the score within five points in the last five minutes), Nate McMillan has generally gone back to Myles Turner with the game on the line. Sometimes, it\u2019s an offense-defense platoon, but Turner (79) has played more than twice as many clutch minutes as Sabonis (38) . * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

But Young hasn\u2019t shown any signs of slowing, making it difficult to give back the top spot to Doncic. And that\u2019s not to say Doncic hasn\u2019t been doing his part \u2014 he\u2019s been great. Over the past two weeks, he\u2019s had three triple-doubles , averaging 23.5 points, 10.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game. The downside is his 3-point shooting has taken a serious hit, as he\u2019s shot just 18.3 percent from there (9-for-49) in his last six games. The argument for Doncic has always been he\u2019s been consistent all season, whereas Young started slow, but has gained steam after finding his shot. If that\u2019s the argument, then equal weight should possibly be given to Doncic\u2019s shooting struggles down the stretch. Young, meanwhile, continues to put up monster numbers, averaging 25.8 ppg and 9.2 apg over his last six games, helping the Hawks go 3-3 with wins against the Utah Jazz , Philadelphia 76ers and New Orleans Pelicans . He has four straight double-doubles while shooting at a 49.1 percent clip (37 percent on 3-pointers) over the last two weeks. His play was good enough to earn him Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors , the first rookie to grab the award this season. With just two weeks to go, the final stretch could go far in determining the Kia Rookie of the Year. If Young keeps up his impressive 30-10 pace with solid shooting numbers while Doncic fades, will it be enough to overcome his poor November, which saw him average 14 ppg on 35 percent shooting (19.8 percent on 3-pointers)? Or will Doncic finish strong and complete one of the most impressive rookie campaigns we\u2019ve seen in years? It could end up being a tight vote (I\u2019ll have more on that next week as I look back at other close ROY races), so you\u2019d be wise to get NBA League Pass if you haven\u2019t already to catch these rookies\u2019 final eight games. * * * Last week:  No. 1 How\u2019s this for rare air? Young had his sixth 30-point, 10-assist game in New Orleans on Tuesday (33 points, 12 assits), which moved him past Michael Jordan and Stephen Curry for second most by a rookie in NBA history. Only Oscar Robertson had more (25). \u201cI\u2019m feeling good, and my teammates honestly make me look good, too,\u201d said Young, who was selected as the East\u2019s Player of the Week after his recent run of sterling performances. \u201cI\u2019m just having fun. That\u2019s the main thing. The ball is moving, shots are falling and it\u2019s fun.\u201d 2. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  Last week:  No. 2 For all the talk about Rookie of the Year, Luka doesn\u2019t seem too worried. \u201cFor me, the Rookie of the Year of course is important, but there\u2019s a lot more things going on,\u201d Doncic told the Dallas Morning News . \u201cIt\u2019s a long season here in the NBA. A lot of talking about that, and I\u2019m just not interested in it.\u201d This week, Doncic notched his seventh triple-double of the season , tying him with Magic Johnson for third-most by a rookie (and most for a player under 21). His most impressive came against the defending champion Warriors, when he had 23 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a surprising 35-point rout in Oakland . Hall of Fame point guard Steve Nash couldn\u2019t help but gush about Doncic this week. \u201cHe\u2019s phenomenal. Just an incredible basketball player. \u2026He\u2019s an incredibly unique player, historically, already, at a young age,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as his uniqueness and accuracy and ability to make plays off the dribble with his size? We just don\u2019t see that. Especially at his age.\u201d 3. Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings  Last week:  Not ranked Bagley returned to the Kings\u2019 lineup March 14 after missing two weeks with a left knee sprain and didn\u2019t miss a beat. In eight games, Bagley averaged 19.4 ppg and 7.8 rpg in 25.8 mpg. The Kings\u2019 playoff hopes are fading, but coach Dave Joerger didn\u2019t hesitate when asked about Bagley\u2019s status among this class. \u201cI\u2019ve got the Rookie of the Year on my roster. \u2026 His level of talent pushes coaches to make sure we\u2019re on point and challenging him every day. He\u2019s just been a joy to coach.\u201d 4. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers  Last week:  Not ranked Sexton has been putting up monster scoring numbers since the All-Star break and especially over the last two weeks. The point guard scored at least 20 in eight straight games (the streak ended Sunday in Milwaukee), and he\u2019s seen the bump thanks to shot selection. Sexton has focused less on mid-range jumpers and instead looked more for the 3-ball, taking 5.6 per game since the All-Star break (compared to 2.7 before ). Overall, he\u2019s shooting at a 48.1 percent clip since the break, knocking down 44.8 percent of his 3-pointers . \u201cHe\u2019s really starting to turn a corner, he\u2019s really starting to figure it out,\u201d coach Larry Drew said . \u201cI want him to continue to learn, to learn how to play the position, to learn how to be a leader, to learn how to get his teammates involved. Just continue to learn the game. He\u2019s the only player on our team that hasn\u2019t missed a game. He\u2019s a warrior.\u201d Last week:  No. 3 Over the last two weeks, Ayton tallied double-doubles in four of his seven games , averaging 16 ppg and 9.6 rpg. He could have had another, but he garnered his first ejection of his young career after picking up two technicals in New Orleans (the second while arguing from the bench) on March 16 . Coach Igor Kokoskov called Ayton\u2019s reaction \u201cinappropriate\u201d while Ayton said he didn\u2019t even realize he\u2019d been ejected as he complained to teammates on the bench. \u201cI guess I was a little too loud in complaining to them.\u201d Just missed the cut:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers The Clippers have won six straight and clinched a playoff spot Tuesday , and Gilgeous-Alexander has been front and center. The point guard has averaged 14 ppg and 6.2 apg while shooting 48.4 percent overall (and 40 percent on 3-pointers). He\u2019s been steady running the offense and a staunch defender, both of which are big reasons the Clippers are back in the postseason. Miles Bridges, Charlotte Hornets The Hornets are fighting for the playoff lives, and Bridges has been a key contributor as a starting forward. In seven games over the past two weeks, Bridges has averaged 9.9 ppg, 6.9 rpg and 1.6 spg as Charlotte has inched closer to the final playoff spot in the East. Frank Jackson, New Orleans Pelicans With Jrue Holiday being shut down for the season , it\u2019s Jackson\u2019s show down the stretch. Over his past six games, the point guard averaged 17 points on 41.9 percent shooting (37.5 percent on 3-pointers), but he\u2019s not putting up huge numbers otherwise (2.7 rpg and 2.7 apg). Landry Shamet, LA Clippers Shamet falls out of the top 5, but deserves some love for helping the Clippers win six straight and clinch a playoff spot. He left Sunday\u2019s win against the Knicks with an ankle injury and missed Tuesday\u2019s win in Minnesota . Coach Doc Rivers says he\u2019ll likely miss \u201ca couple games,\u201d which should have him ready for the playoffs. * * * (All stats through Wednesday, March 27) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Beyond his success in the NBA, he also crafted an international hoops career that few can match. Success was no stranger to him from the outset of his 16-season career with the Spurs, as Ginobili captured four NBA titles and posted a career winning percentage of .721 (762-295) \u2014 the best in in NBA history among players who have appeared in at least 1,000 games. Aside from those NBA accomplishments, Ginobili is one of only two players in history, along with Bill Bradley, to win a EuroLeague title, an NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal. Then there was the drive, dedication and all-out style of play Ginobili exemplified that endeared him to fans in San Antonio and beyond. After Thursday\u2019s jersey retirement ceremony, he is now the ninth Spurs player to have his number raised to the rafters, joining Bruce Bowen (No. 12), Tim Duncan (21), Sean Elliott (32), George Gervin (44), Avery Johnson (6), Johnny Moore (00), David Robinson (50) and James Silas (13). Although he was the 57th overall pick of the 1999 Draft, Ginobili ended his career as the Spurs\u2019 all-time leader in 3-pointers made (1,495) and steals (1,392) while ranking third in games played (1,057), fourth in assists (4,001), fourth in free throws made (3,380) and fifth in points (14,043). He made the All-NBA Third Team in 2008 and \u201911, was a two-time All-Star (\u201905, \u201911) and the \u201908 NBA Sixth Man of the Year. In short, Ginobili crafted a legacy that will endure for generations with the Spurs.

A 10-point deficit turned into a 14-point lead when the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 24 unanswered points in their 107-99 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Paul George led the way with 31 points, including seven during OKC\u2019s third-quarter eruption, while Russell Westbrook added 17 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds for his 29th triple-double of the season. The Pacers contributed to the biggest run by any team this season by missing 14 consecutive shots in a span of six-plus minutes. After Tyreke Evans finally made a layup at the 3:57 mark to end the run, Westbrook immediately hit a mid-range jumper over Cory Joseph and broke into his rock-the-baby celebration. It was a critical win for Oklahoma City, which had lost five of six. The Pacers, meanwhile, who have lost nine straight road games, are in danger of losing their No. 4 seed in the East and homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs to the No. 5 Boston Celtics. Those teams play at TD Garden on Friday. Two nights after scoring 59 points against the Utah Jazz, Devin Booker was still feeling it. With 30 points at halftime, Booker was seen saying to a fan near the court, \u201cI\u2019m going for 50.\u201d And Booker scored exactly 50 points, which was a career high at home. Booker, 22, became the youngest player in NBA history with consecutive 50-point games, but his latest scoring binge was wasted once again by the Phoenix Suns in a 124-121 loss to the Washington Wizards. It marked the first time a Phoenix player reached 50 in back-to-back games. Tom Chambers had been the only member of the Suns to score even 40 in successive games. Booker is the seventh player to score 50 points in consecutive games since the NBA-ABA merger (1976-77), joining Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Allen Iverson, Michael Jordan, Antawn Jamison and Bernard King. \u201cHe can get any shot he wants.\u201d That was Steve Kerr\u2019s take on the most efficient shooting game of Kevin Durant\u2019s career. Durant and Stephen Curry each scored 28 points \u2014 with Durant hitting 12 of 13 from the field \u2014 and the Golden State Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 118-103 . Durant made all seven of his shots in the first half and didn\u2019t miss a shot until 6:33 remained in regulation. He also added nine rebounds, five assists and two steals in 35 minutes. \u201cI feel like he could\u2019ve been 24-for-25 if he wanted,\u201d Kerr told reporters after the game. \u201cBut he was distributing the ball and trying to get everyone involved. He was brilliant.\u201d With a 3-pointer at the 2:50 mark of the second quarter against the Golden State Warriors, Mike Conley became the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 all-time leading scorer once again. Conley moved past Marc Gasol, who scored 11,684 points during his 10-plus seasons with Memphis before he was traded to the Toronto Raptors last month. Conley actually passed Gasol for first place during the 2016-17 season before Gasol reclaimed the lead last season as Conley missed 70 games with an Achilles injury. Already the franchise leader in games played, assists, steals and 3-pointers made, Conley becomes just the third player to currently lead an NBA franchise in all of those five categories. The others: LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Reggie Miller (Indiana Pacers). Conley, averaging a career-high 20.9 points this season, finished with 22 points and eight assists in the Grizzlies\u2019 118-103 loss to the Warriors. Jeff Green added Dragan Bender to his poster collection. With 30 points in the first half on the heels of a 32-point second half Monday night, Devin Booker became the third player in the past 15 seasons with consecutive 30-point halves.

It still remains unknown when Oladipo will suit up again for the Pacers. However, based on the latest video posted on social media, Oladipo is proving to be someone who heals quickly. Oladipo posted a video to his Instagram account today that showed him meeting with his doctor in Miami, where he underwent surgery and began his rehabilitation process. In the video, a doctor tells Oladipo, \u201cAs soon as you feel comfortable without the brace, you can stop wearing the brace. I\u2019d like you to wear it, at least publicly, for the next few weeks. But, in therapy and around the house, I actually don\u2019t want you in the brace \u2026 just to get used to it.\u201d The doctor then commends Oladipo by saying the NBA star\u2019s balance is \u201cfine\u201d and says he is eight weeks and a day from when the surgery took place. Oladipo\u2019s surgery took place on Jan. 28, per the Pacers . From there, Oladipo then walks the hallway of the doctor\u2019s office without a brace on his right knee. In the post, Oladipo wrote: \u201c8 weeks and a day post surgery. No brace, No crutches, No problem!!! Shoutout to @jeff_ruiz03 for helping me with PT through my rehab it\u2019s only the beginning!! 2 Timothy 1:7\u201d The video today comes roughly two weeks after Oladipo posted a video his Instagram account of himself putting up some shots. In that video, which went out on March 12, Oladipo \u2014 then wearing a brace on his knee \u2014 sits on large box and hits a shot from the top of the key. After making it, he says, \u201cThey say you gotta crawl before you can walk.\u201d Then, he takes a shot from the last wing, sinks it and says, \u201cThey say you gotta walk before you can run.\u201d Lastly, he makes a shot from the right corner and says \u201cEither way, I am truly unbreakable.\u201d After having his surgery, Oladipo faced an uncertain timetable ahead for his return to the court. The 2019 All-Star guard spoke with the media on a conference call in early February and was taking a day-by-day approach to his recovery. \u201cAt the end of the day I\u2019m a positive butterfly,\u201d Oladipo said on Feb. 11 . \u201cI\u2019m not looking too far into the future and I\u2019m not looking at the past; just focused on today and trying to get better every day.\u201d Oladipo was injured during the second quarter of a Jan. 23 game vs. the Toronto Raptors as he was racing back to defend a transition break. He collapsed as he closed on the Raptors\u2019 Pascal Siakam. This season, Oladipo was averaging 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 31.9 minutes.

We will start with the Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award. This isn\u2019t a case for or against any particular player. It\u2019s just a dive into some of the relevant numbers for consideration. * * * More articles from this series: We\u2019ll start pretty simple. Here are the 15 players who have seen the biggest increases in points + rebounds + assists per game from last season. For some of the players listed above, it\u2019s all about minutes. Cedi Osman has seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in minutes per game, from 11.0 last season to 32.1 this season . In fact, the only player above who doesn\u2019t rank in the top 33 in regard to minutes-per-game increase is Paul George. To take the minutes increase out of the math, we can look at points, rebounds and assists on a per-36 basis. Both Giannis Antetokounmpo (two seasons ago) and George (in 2012-13) have won the Most Improved award before . But there\u2019s a case to be made that one of them should win it again. Shooting is the most important skill in the game, and one that a player can really improve upon over the course of his career. Here are the players who have seen the biggest increase in effective field goal percentage from last season. Three names are on both the effective field goal percentage list and the PRA per-36 list: Danilo Gallinari, Derrick Rose and Domantas Sabonis. Of course, there\u2019s more to scoring than shooting from the field. True shooting percentage is a measure of scoring efficiency, taking free throws into account. Here are the players who have seen the biggest increase in true shooting percentage from last season. The top five guys on the true shooting percentage list are the same as the top five on the effective field goal percentage list. But Pascal Siakam rises from 21st on the eFG% list to sixth on the TS% list, thanks to a big jump in free throw rate, which also helps De\u2019Aaron Fox and Spencer Dinwiddie. Four names are on both the true shooting percentage list and the PRA per-36 list: Fox, Gallinari, Sabonis and Siakam. Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, ranks 34th on the true shooting percentage list, having seen a jump from 59.8 percent to 64.2 percent . George ranks 77th ( 57.0 percent to 58.6 percent ). Rebounding numbers were included in the basics above. But here\u2019s a closer look at the players who have seen the biggest jump in rebounding percentage (the percentage of available rebounds grabbed while on the floor). There are Antetokounmpo and George again. Gallinari and Sabonis are on this list as well. Siakam\u2019s rebounding percentage (10.5 percent) is down a bit from last season (10.9 percent). We didn\u2019t include steals or blocks in the per-game or per-36 numbers above. We can look at them in comparison to fouls committed, and see how players have improved from last season. Fox is on this list too. Myles Turner is one of two players (Anthony Davis is the other) that have played at least 500 minutes this season with more blocks than personal fouls. NBA.com\u2019s PIE statistic takes all of a player\u2019s stats as a percentage of all the stats accumulated in the games he played in. The formula can be found in the NBA.com\/stats glossary and the league leaders are Antetokounmpo (21.5 percent), Anthony Davis (19.7 percent) and James Harden (19.7 percent). Here are the players who have seen the biggest jumps from last season. Increased usage isn\u2019t necessarily a measure of improvement. But it does tell us how much of his team\u2019s load that a player is carrying. Here are the players that have seen the biggest increase in usage rate. Usage rate looks at who is finishing a possession. But a player could have a high usage rate while being assisted on most of his field goal attempts or trips to the line. Here are the players that have seen the biggest drop in the percentage of their field goals that have been assisted. This may be the best statistical case for Siakam as the league\u2019s most improved player. He\u2019s doing a lot more work for himself than he did last season. For most the calculations above, we used a minimum of 20 games or 250 minutes played last season. Those minimums are somewhat arbitrary, but they\u2019re to eliminate small sample sizes that might not illustrate what a player was capable of. Of course, they also eliminated a few interesting candidates \u2013 Thomas Bryant (just 72 total minutes played in 15 games last season), Monte Morris (25 minutes in three games) and Derrick White (139 minutes in 17 games) \u2013 if you think that second-year players are worth considering for the Most Improved award. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.
