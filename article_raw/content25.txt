Uh, have you looked at the standings lately? As I write this, the Nuggets are tied with Golden State atop the West (but the Warriors own the tiebreaker there). They\u2019ve won seven of their last eight. They batter opponents on the boards, thanks to first-among-equals Nikola Jokic and other committee members. And no team has better chemistry than this group, which has taken a big step since losing its \u201cplay-in\u201d game vs. Minnesota last April. Of course, for the postseason, it would be nice to have that one wing or perimeter guy who can create or get to the foul line. And it\u2019d be nice if we could hold off on this answer until next week, by which time the Nuggets will have played road games at Houston, Oklahoma City and Golden State. In the meantime, mark me down as a qualified yes. Shaun Powell :  False. With all due respect to coach Mike Malone\u2019s crew, the Nuggets have proven to be a very good regular season team and one that hasn\u2019t ventured into the playoff fire. Therefore, the team most qualified to get beat by the Golden State Warriors in the conference finals is the Houston Rockets, who bring a flammable James Harden, a healthy Chris Paul and enough necessary pieces to make a return trip to late May. Besides, Denver and Houston are only separated by a few wins, shocking considering how the Rockets started 11-14. John Schuhmann :  True. It\u2019s right there in the standings and in the numbers. The Nuggets are the only Western Conference team that ranks in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They have the second-best record (12-9, worse than only Oklahoma City\u2019s 14-10) in games played between the West\u2019s playoff teams, with wins over each of the other seven. They have a player \u2014 Nikola Jokic \u2014 who deserves a spot on the Kia MVP ballot and have solid depth behind him. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that the Nuggets will definitely reach the conference finals. The playoffs are different than the regular season and five or six teams in the West have the ability to win two series.  Sekou Smith :  True. I believe the Nuggets have worked their way into that position behind the Golden State Warriors this season. And who knows, they could very well grab that No. 1 seed in the Western Conference between now and the end of the season. But even if they are the second-best team in the West on April 10, I think the team that poses the greatest threat to the Warriors once the playoffs start is the Houston Rockets. Now, I realize I\u2019m technically answering a question that wasn\u2019t asked. But the Rockets just feel like a more dangerous team in a playoff setting. The star power and big-play potential on their roster feels more dynamic to me than what the Nuggets bring. Granted, we don\u2019t know how this Nuggets bunch reacts in the postseason, since they missed out on that opportunity on the final night of last season. But I\u2019m taking a see-it-to-believe-it attitude with this Nuggets team in the playoffs."},{"id":34774,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-case-against-sixers-finals","date":"2019-03-27","title":"Blogtable: Your case for (and against) why Sixers could make The Finals?","content":"* * * Your case for and against the Philadelphia 76ers going all the way to the NBA Finals?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  OK, for the Sixers in The Finals: They have a killer starting lineup, with so much offensive weaponry, that defenses are loathe to double anybody \u2014 which only makes each more dangerous. Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons in particular are matchup nightmares, a better tandem than any Philadelphia will face in the East bracket. And none of the other conference contenders is without flaws. Now my case against the Sixers: They are reckless with the ball (15.3 turnovers per game). They send opponents to the foul line a lot. Philadelphia runs \u201chot\u201d in games, too, with strong, yakkety-yak personalities that can flare up in unproductive ways. And I\u2019m not sold on the bond between the players and the coaching staff, despite Brett Brown\u2019s comforting bedside manner. Any disconnect could show itself as the stakes and pressure get dialed up. Shaun Powell :  Here\u2019s the \u201cfor\u201d argument: They have the best starting five in the East and there isn\u2019t a weak spot at any of those starting positions. Also, they own a pair of defensive aces in Joel Embiid and Jimmy Butler and solid 3-point shooting with JJ Redick and Tobias Harris. Here\u2019s the \u201cagainst\u201d argument: None of their main pieces (Embiid, Butler, Harris, Ben Simmons) have gone anywhere in the postseason, you wonder how effective Simmons can be in the final moments of a tight game because of an inability to shoot from deep, and their bench is vulnerable if any starter gets injured or into foul trouble. John Schuhmann :  The case for is pretty simple. The Sixers have a terrific starting lineup and they have at least two of those starters on the floor at all times. And it\u2019s not just five good players, because Joel Embiid is one of the league\u2019s most dominant, two-way forces and a matchup problem for any opponent (even Al Horford, as we saw last week). The case against starts with the fact that, with two weeks left in the season, the starting lineup has played just nine games together . They will go into the playoffs without the same familiarity that the East\u2019s other contenders have. Embiid rolling to the basket with Ben Simmons already occupying space on the baseline remains an awkward situation. Also, the Sixers\u2019 depth \u2014 both in general and in regard to shooting \u2014 is a major issue. So when they do have fewer than five starters on the floor (for about 30 minutes per game), the opponent can take advantage.  Sekou Smith :  Star power is my case for the Philadelphia 76ers grinding their way to The Finals. If it were to happen, and I\u2019m still on the fence about the Sixers\u2019 chances with that, it would have to come on the shoulders of the NBA\u2019s most top-heavy starting five outside of Oakland. The right matchups in the postseason are critical \u2014 as they usually are for any team trying to reach The Finals. Joel Embiid\u2019s availability, in particular, becomes the make-or-break factor for this team. But that\u2019s also where the case against the Sixers making it all the way there shines a spotlight on Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick. Their chemistry as a group has to be sound. Coach Brett Brown must make sure his guys are locked into their roles in every game of every series. If not, they are just as susceptible to be upset in the playoffs as they are to reach The Finals. If there is a disconnect, it could be fatal.

Rudy Gobert, 2. Paul George and 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo . \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d length and activity on defense bolster his Kia MVP case and the Bucks are first in defensive rating . But it really is a group effort for Milwaukee, with center Brook Lopez and pest Eric Bledsoe equally important. George played this season (when healthy) as if challenging himself to be the NBA\u2019s best two-way player. Gobert, though, is the only guy with a chance to repeat, a common trend with this award through the years. His blocked shots have ticked slightly down, but that\u2019s due to awareness and respect, the way base runners don\u2019t test certain outfielders\u2019 rifle arms. Shaun Powell :  First is Kawhi Leonard , top five in steals and capable of guarding three positions, much like the No. 2 choice, Paul George , the current steals leader. Third is Joel Embiid , whose work in the paint ranks him right with Rudy Gobert in terms of interior defense. John Schuhmann :  In alphabetical order\u2026 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo , the best defender on the league\u2019s best defensive team . He doesn\u2019t have the steal or deflection numbers of Paul George, but players shoot poorly when he\u2019s around and the Bucks\u2019 defense has been at its best when he\u2019s been on the floor . 2. Joel Embiid , who ranks as one of the league\u2019s best rim protectors and makes a huge impact on the Sixers\u2019 defense when he\u2019s on the floor. 3. Rudy Gobert , who hasn\u2019t had quite as good a defensive season as he did last year (when he won the award), but remains the league\u2019s best rim protector in regard to both preventing and altering shots near the basket (the most valuable shots on the floor). And I reserve the right to replace one or two of the above with George and\/or Myles Turner two weeks from now.  Sekou Smith :  I know this will enrage Draymond Green but I\u2019m going big this year with my candidates for Defensive Player of the Year. I\u2019m starting with Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert at No. 1 , Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid at No. 2 and Oklahoma City\u2019s Paul George at No. 3 . In a season where offensive performances have been off the charts, it\u2019s hard to pin-point high-level defensive performances that resonate in the same fashion as 50 or 60-point games. But these three guys all rate high on the impact meter defensively and their efforts have been consistent all season."},{"id":34767,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-3-26-19","date":"2019-03-27","title":"About Last Night: East playoff races tighten up","content":" While the top of the Eastern Conference is firming up, things are heating up in the race for the final spots. The Heat entered the night with a 1\/2-game lead on the Magic, and two games up on the Hornets. They ended the night on the outside looking in. The Magic, one of the hottest teams in the East, beat Miami 104-99 to leapfrog the Heat and take over the No. 8 seed. Nikola Vucevic scored 24 points and grabbed 16 rebounds; all five players scored in double-digits as Orlando won its sixth-straight game, the team\u2019s longest streak since January 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging. It\u2019s fun,\u201d said Aaron Gordon, who chipped in 14 points and 10 rebounds. \u201cThere\u2019s an energy, there\u2019s a buzz in the gym when we come in, and it\u2019s just a beautiful thing.\u201d Charlotte, meanwhile, took care of business at home, beating San Antonio 125-116 in OT behind a monster game from Kemba Walker. The Hornets point guard scored 38 points (11 in OT) to go along with nine rebounds and 11 assists to spark Charlotte to its fourth straight win, the team\u2019s longest winning streak this season. \u201cGuys are locked in right now,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d Indeed, anything is possible, especially in the crowded East. The Brooklyn Nets, at 38-37, are currently sixth in the East, but only 2 1\/2 games separate them and Charlotte, who sit in 10th. The Pistons fell, 95-92, in Denver on Tuesday to slip to 37-37 on the season, but kept their grip on the seventh spot in the standings. With two weeks left in the season, these five teams are fighting for the final three spots in the East. Here\u2019s how the schedules shake out for the stretch run, with what looks like two intriguing matchups on the final night of the season: Nets vs. Heat, and Hornets vs. Magic. MVP showdown in Milwaukee  P.J. Tucker arrived to Tuesday\u2019s matchup in Milwaukee with a message: But the Bucks left the arena with a win and their Twitter folks responded with some expert Photoshop work. In the final matchup of Kia MVP frontrunners Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden, \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d came out on top, with some help from Eric Bledsoe. Giannis finished with 19 points and 14 rebounds, but Bledsoe scored 23 points and scored 16 in a key third-quarter stretch that propelled the Bucks to a 108-94 win over the Rockets . More importantly, he helped stifle Harden, holding the NBA\u2019s leading scorer to 23 points on 9-for-26 shooting (1-for-9 on 3s). With a national TV audience watching, neither player put up monster numbers, but Giannis got the win to help Milwaukee improve to a league-best 56-19, which might be enough to inch him ahead of Harden in the race for the Kia MVP. Chris Bosh, who helped lead the Miami Heat to back-to-back championships in 2012 and \u201913, saw his jersey raised to the rafters Tuesday night in Miami. The 6-foot-11 forward, who had his career cut short due to blood clots in his legs, was a key figure in the Heat\u2019s Big Three \u2014 alongside LeBron James and Dwyane wade \u2014 and drew big cheers Tuesday night as his No. 1 was immortalized in Miami. With a 122-111 win in Minnesota , the Clippers clinched a playoff spot in a season many thought Doc Rivers\u2019 team might flounder in the West. \u201dI\u2019m just really happy for our guys,\u201d Rivers said. \u201dBefore the year, we went through all the articles about us and how bad we were going to be. I just told them, they don\u2019t know us.\u201d The Clippers have won six straight, and with seven games to play can still earn home-court advantage in the first round. Minnesota\u2019s interim coach Ryan Saunders sees a dangerous team in the Clippers. \u201dThey might be playing the best basketball out of anybody in the league right now,\u201d Saunders said. In case the picture didn\u2019t tell the whole story, the video should do the trick. Kyle Lowry dropped one of the best dimes of the season, fooling Chicago\u2019s Ryan Arcidiacono with the nutmeg dish to find OG Anunoby for the easy layup. Lowry\u2019s expression after the slick dime says it all: Chris Paul sent Milwaukee\u2019s D.J. Wilson flying down the lane with this sick crossover, step-back 3-pointer. OK, Chris Paul\u2019s juke was nice, but Lance Stephenson\u2019s move had it all. 1. Lance Stephenson not only sends Jeff Green flying with a crossover (and a slyly placed foot on Green\u2019s), behind-the-back dribble, but he hits the shot, too. 2. The bench reacts with quite possibly the best bench reaction ever. Rajon Rondo nearly takes out an official with a double-towel wave before finally collapsing on the sideline. JaVale McGee, for his part, is left stunned, holding his head in his hands. 3. Lance caps it all off with a shimmy dance like no other.  Miami\u2019s Derrick Jones Jr., runner-up in the 2017 Slam Dunk Contest, threw down a monster jam over Orlando\u2019s Nikola Vucevic. Down to the wire  Luka Doncic and Trae Young are both finishing the season strong in their push to take home the Kia Rookie of the Year hardware. Doncic has been consistent from Day One with his seasoned play, but the Hawks\u2019 Young is making a late push with a flurry of huge games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week on Monday, the only rookie to score the honor this season. Tonight, both rookies put up big numbers to back up their cases. Young went for 33 points and 12 assists to help Atlanta beat New Orleans, 130-120 for a third straight win. He was 5-for-13 on 3s, which gave him four games of at least 30 points, 10 assists and five 3s. That\u2019s his fourth game this season of 30 and 10 with five 3s, pushing him past Stephen Curry, who had three in 2009-10. Doncic, though, isn\u2019t backing down with Young breathing down his neck. The Mavs\u2019 phenom tallied his seventh triple-double of the season, tying Magic Johnson for third-most by a rookie. Doncic finished with 28 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists, but also missed all nine 3-pointers in Dallas\u2019 125-121 loss to the Kings . After tonight\u2019s action, here\u2019s how the matchups would break down: "},{"id":34765,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/parker-flies-spurs-ginobili","date":"2019-03-27","title":"Parker flies back with Spurs for Ginobili's jersey retirement","content":" Despite being in the middle of a playoff push with his current team, Tony Parker isn\u2019t missing the chance to honor an iconic member of his old one.

The ceremony will take place on Thursday, from where Parker will then fly to Los Angeles to rejoin the Hornets for their Friday tilt against the Lakers, according to Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News .

The French point guard spent 17 seasons with the Spurs, a span which included five All-Star appearances, four NBA championships and the 2007 Finals MVP award. Parker, Ginobili and Tim Duncan formed the core of the Spurs\u2019 most successful era under Gregg Popovich, who has coached the team since 1997.

Milwaukee\u2019s game Tuesday against Houston had been billed as a showdown of favorites to win the NBA\u2019s most prestigious award, with Antetokounmpo and the Rockets\u2019 James Harden going head-to-head for only the second and likely final time this season. But by the time fans at Fiserv Forum chanted again, with 1:15 left and Antetokounmpo draining his final points, they had blown a ripe opportunity \u2014 particularly the boisterous fans in a section that dates back to Andrew Bogut and his cultivation of some football and rugby rowdiness. At that point, the proper chant would have been: \u201cM-V-D! M-V-D!\u201d Because for all the individual star power on the floor, the difference-maker for Milwaukee was its defense. Pestering, daring, consistent and expertly executed defense, to be precise. Folks who showed up or tuned in anticipating offensive pyrotechnics from Harden and Antetokounmpo might have been disappointed. The Houston gunner scored 23 points, 13 below his average (36.4 ppg), while shooting 9-of-26 overall and a clangy 1-of-9 on 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo finished with 19 points, eight shy of his average, while making seven of 15 shots. Their other numbers were solid \u2014 Harden had 10 rebounds and seven assists, Antetokounmpo 14 boards, four assists \u2014 but neither would claim the award with 82 such nights. It wasn\u2019t as if others picked up the slack, either. Bucks point guard Eric Bledsoe probably was the game\u2019s best performer with 23 points, seven assists, a steal and a couple of blocked shots. Chris Paul had 19 points for Houston and center Clint Capela added 17. But the numbers that popped came courtesy of Milwaukee\u2019s defense, the NBA\u2019s finest. It held Houston to 36.4 percent shooting, including 30.8 percent (16-of-52) from the arc. Besides Harden\u2019s misfires, Eric Gordon and P.J. Tucker were a combined 1-of-16 for the Rockets, 1-of-13 on 3-pointers. The Bucks were better on the boards (60-46), allowing Houston only eight offensive rebounds. They dominated in fast-break scoring, 28-2, and that wasn\u2019t due only to the Rockets\u2019 preferred slower pace. The visitors had nine chances pushing the ball up the floor, and scored just once. In the paint? It was Bucks 46, Rockets 36. That last one was the most impressive, if you saw how many times the Bucks almost invited Rockets players \u2014 Harden in particular \u2014 to attack the rim \u2026 and lived to tell about it. Oh, the reigning MVP and NBA\u2019s leading scorer hit several floaters with high degrees of difficulty. But the Bucks were willing to live with those, if it meant getting Harden off the 3-point line and venturing inside with defenders Brook Lopez and Antetokounmpo on his mind. \u201cWe were just trying to take him away from what he\u2019s so comfortable doing,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cOur guards, first and foremost, did a great job of making him uncomfortable and getting him out of his spots. Then we had great help side defense from the weak side \u2014 Giannis was there \u2014 and we were helping the helper. \u2026 We were very active.\u201d Lopez was a model of positioning. He didn\u2019t block a single shot, yet he loomed large in Houston\u2019s shooters mind whenever they ventured inside. Meanwhile, Bledsoe, Sterling Brown, Khris Middleton and a couple others pulled the on-ball duty against the league\u2019s No. 1 ball dominator. On multiple possessions, those defenders so overplayed Harden\u2019s lethal left hand that they were manned up sideways, forcing him to his right. It was as extreme as the shifts we see these days on MLB diamonds, almost daring the opponent to take advantage. Heck, several times Bledsoe seemed to be defending Harden from behind, maybe the best way to thwart his trademark, referee-vexing, back-pedaling 3-pointers. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, right?\u201d Lopez said. \u201cOur guards were very aggressive. It looks like they\u2019re not \u2014 it looks like they\u2019re leaving him alone. But they\u2019re doing a lot to get into him.\u201d Said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer: \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to maybe reduce the number of threes he gets, reduce the number of free throws he gets. I think the whole league is trying to be creative \u2014 it\u2019s certainly not about a weakness. \u201cIf he\u2019s making tough twos in the paint and we keep him off the free throw line and the 3-point line, you\u2019re giving yourself a chance, to make him have to do something a little bit differently.\u201d  Harden wasn\u2019t too generous toward the Bucks, blaming himself for his misses. \u201cI still got my shots up. I was still aggressive. I still did what I was supposed to do,\u201d he said. Offensive players and offensive-minded teams tend to think that way \u2014 it\u2019s on them, hit or miss \u2014 and Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni echoed that. \u201cHe needed help from Eric or P.J. to knock down shots. I\u2019m not a big believer in them stopping James. It\u2019s what we can stop James and that\u2019s about it.\u201d That\u2019s fine, but the Bucks held Harden to a combined 22-of-56 shooting (39.3 percent) and swept the season series. They outshot their opponent for the 56th time \u2014 they\u2019re 54-2 when they do that \u2014 and they top the NBA both in defensive rating (102.4 as the night began) and net rating (9.2). Antetokounmpo is the linchpin, his defensive bent and prowess bolstering his MVP case. But he has dedicated, reliable help, notably in Lopez and Bledsoe, who was jazzed for his Harden matchup. \u201cThose guys are All-NBA all-defense guys,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThe three prongs were all working well together.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He spoke about his health scare in 2015. He spoke of his grandfather, the one he called Daddy Jack, the one who told his first grandson that he was going to be special one day.  And was Daddy Jack ever right.  In Heat history, his grandson is now officially immortal.  Wearing a Heat championship ring on both hands, Bosh watched a giant banner bearing his name and No. 1 raised to the rafters of AmericanAirlines Arena on Tuesday night \u2014 then delivered an emotional address to the crowd, part of it even in Spanish as a show of respect to the Latin culture of Miami.  \u201cMy name, my family name up here, that\u2019s something I used to get laughed at for dreaming of,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cSo never let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t accomplish your dream. Those four letters on the back of that jersey are my wife\u2019s name, my kids\u2019 name, my father\u2019s name, my grandfather\u2019s name. We\u2019re not just carrying on for another generation. But now, Daddy Jack, we\u2019re up there forever.\u201d     The ceremony came a little more than three years after Bosh played his final game of a 13-year career, 11 of those good enough for All-Star nods, four of them culminating in trips to the NBA Finals, two of them capped by championships. He is the fourth player to have his number retired by the Heat, joining Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway and Shaquille O\u2019Neal.  \u201cForever, and for always, a lifer of the Miami Heat,\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said, moments before Bosh\u2019s banner was unfurled and hoisted.  Riley called Bosh\u2019s rebound and assist late in regulation of Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals \u2014 the ones that set up Ray Allen\u2019s game-tying, series-saving 3-pointer \u2014 the biggest in Heat history. Bosh went a step further.  \u201cThe biggest rebound in NBA history,\u201d Bosh said.  There will be, at minimum, three more Heat jersey retirements in the not-so-distant future \u2014 Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Udonis Haslem are all locks to see their name and number swaying over the court not long after their careers end.    Wade and Haslem were on the court for the celebration. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra decided long ago that, even with Tuesday\u2019s Miami-Orlando matchup being such a big game in terms of playoff hopes, his players were going to be out on the floor to see the Bosh ceremony.  Wade introduced Bosh, telling stories of how he learned Spanish off Rosetta Stone CDs and how he became an outstanding self-taught guitar player who wound up jamming with the legendary Buddy Guy. He also talked about how much he admires the way Bosh embraces being a father and husband.  \u201cThe person who made the `Big 3\u2032 era legendary,\u201d Wade said.  Spoelstra tells stories of his time with Bosh all the time. One of his favorites \u2014 the night Bosh, after a playoff loss in Indiana put the Heat down 2-1 in a series, knocked on the door of his hotel suite at 2 a.m. with beers in hand. They sipped and talked for 45 minutes, not a word said about basketball. The Heat won Game 4, and the series.  \u201cIf you want to understand our culture and what we\u2019re about, there\u2019s nothing better than a night like tonight,\u201d Spoelstra said.  The Heat also presented Bosh with a $50,000 gift for his foundation and a one-of-a-kind guitar designed by his friend Rey Jeffet Jr. And in his remarks, Bosh detailed how much his first health scare in 2015 \u2013 caused by a blood clot, just like how his career ultimately ended in 2016 \u2013 was ultimately aided by Heat fans.  The team sent thousands of get-well cards from fans to Bosh\u2019s home. He read them all.  \u201cThose letters pushed me to get back on this court,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cThose letters inspired me to get back up and walk across the room when I didn\u2019t think I had the energy to do it.\u201d  For a time, he and the Heat were estranged. Bosh wanted to keep playing. The Heat didn\u2019t feel his health issues would allow that. Eventually, the sides reached an understanding and then they finally began talking again.  Now he\u2019s back in the Heat family, forever.  \u201cI feel like I can officially, officially, officially move on,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cIt all happened really fast, but we\u2019re here. I\u2019m so happy. And we get to move on into the next life together.\u201d   "},{"id":34748,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/toronto-raptors-jodie-meeks-official-release","date":"2019-03-26","title":"Raptors sign veteran guard Meeks","content":" The Toronto Raptors announced Tuesday they have signed guard Jodie Meeks.

Per the Blazers , Nurkic \u201csustained compound fractures to his left tibia and fibula.\u201d The injury was described as \u201cseason-ending\u201d and they said there is no current timetable for his return. Nurkic underwent successful surgery on Tuesday, the team announced. The Blazers big man was attempting to tip in a teammate\u2019s missed shot when he came down awkwardly in traffic, causing his leg to bend between the knee and ankle. He finished the game with 32 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, four blocks and two steals. Nurkic is enjoying a career season, averaging 15.4 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and one steal per game for fourth-place Portland. Despite Monday\u2019s win, Damian Lillard and the rest of Nurkic\u2019s Blazers teammates were subdued in the aftermath of losing one of their most valuable players in such a fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, man,\u201d Lillard said after the game. \u201cWe fight so hard all season long and our starting center, one of our main guys, goes down. On a big night for us, going into the postseason, it looked bad. It\u2019s kind of discouraging to see that. Especially with CJ [McCollum] being out , it\u2019s just another thing. More adversity, it seems like, at the wrong time. Like I said before, we\u2019ve got to lean on each other even more. We\u2019ve got to trust guys and count on guys to step up into his role and do it by committee. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want us to say, \u2018All right, let\u2019s feel sorry for ourselves and feel sorry for Nurk and not care as much.\u2019 So we\u2019re going to finish the job, try to get the game, but I think after the game, that\u2019s when it kicks in.\u201d The Blazers held a collective moment of silence and prayer for Nurkic in the locker room following the game. Fellow Blazers big man Zach Collins was also taken aback by Nurkic\u2019s injury, telling Joe Freeman of The Oregonian : \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. Obviously you never want to see that happen, especially with your own teammate that you go to war with every night. Nurk, he\u2019s been having a hell of a season. He had an amazing game tonight. And for it to end like that for him, it\u2019s just tough. All we can do is be there for him and hope he\u2019s in as little pain as possible and knows that we\u2019ve got his back.\u201d Nurkic\u2019s injury means Collins as well as Enes Kanter, whom the Blazers signed off waivers on Feb. 13, will have a much bigger role for Portland as the regular season ends and the 2019 playoffs approach. Portland is 2 1\/2 games ahead of the No. 5-seeded Jazz in the West and would face Utah if the playoffs were to start today. \u201cI\u2019m going to go home and pray for him because this is way bigger than basketball,\u201d Kanter said after the game. \u201cWe clinched a playoff spot and we\u2019re not even celebrating. He was a big part of our family \u2014 not our team, our family \u2014 and I just don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s definitely tough.\u201d The Nets, who watched guard Caris LeVert wheeled off the court after an injury earlier this season, had the same concern for Nurkic. \u201cThat\u2019s what our guys are talking about in the locker room,\u201d Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cNot the game or the loss. They\u2019re talking about a player who was having a great game and a heck of a player so you just pray it\u2019s not a long-term thing and he can bounce back. It just takes the wind out of your sails.\u201d Players from other teams, accustomed to going against Portland\u2019s physically imposing center, didn\u2019t hesitate to send well wishes, thoughts and prayers via social media. His teammates also took to social media as well to do likewise. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

They and their respective teams, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Houston Rockets, would put on full display their skills, their competitiveness and their impact, not just on random nights in random basketball games but in snagging a championship. They would demonstrate, in a word, their value. To their teams and to winning, relative to all the league\u2019s other players watching from home. It could happen. The Bucks and the Rockets conceivably could meet in The Finals to set up this dream MVP showdown. A long shot though, right? Besides, in the current \u201cimperfect\u201d system, ballots are due by the end of the regular season. So as far as having the two leading candidates for the NBA\u2019s premier individual award on the court together, we must settle for the Rockets\u2019 sole regular-season visit to Milwaukee tonight. And let\u2019s be honest, an award that exists to honor a player\u2019s value over 82 games will not and should not be determined by the outcome or stats in a single clash. Still, voters likely will be watching in search of subtlety, nuance and that 1.2 percent sliver of additional data in trying to make an informed selection. When these teams last met on Jan. 9 in Houston , Antetokounmpo had 27 points on 8-of-16 shooting , 21 rebounds, five assists and three turnovers in a 116-109 win. Harden finished with 42 points on 13-of-30 with 11 boards , six assists and nine turnovers. At this stage of the season, what we\u2019re realistically talking about is the More Valuable Player because this is looking like a two-man race. Others have had marvelous seasons and three of them in various combinations will wind up on voters\u2019 MVP ballot. But Antetokounmpo and Harden appear to have distanced themselves from the competition, owing to their individual excellence, their teams\u2019 fortunes, some raw statistics and a bunch of intangibles in play since October. That is a rough definition of \u201cvaluable,\u201d the key to this award and a word that can be so amorphous at times like this. In 2016-17, when trying to choose between Harden and Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook in a similar dual-favorites MVP race, a panel of NBA insiders were asked on NBA.com to specify their voting criteria. The result? A hodge-podge of standards and measures. All of them legitimate, by the way. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that there\u2019s a complicated matrix of factors that go into making this vote,\u201d our man Sekou Smith said. Colleague John Schuhmann put it this way: \u201cMy vote went to the individual who had the biggest effect on why a good team was good.\u201d Others cited a gut-instinct reaction or just overall value. My definition of MVP attempted to illustrate how tricky the term can be. It is \u201cthe best player on the team with the best record,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cUnless it\u2019s the star who has done something statistically and artistically masterful over the 82-game, regular-season canvas. Unless it\u2019s the guy most responsible for boosting his team the furthest beyond so-called experts\u2019 preseason predictions. Unless it\u2019s the player who doesn\u2019t benefit from playing alongside other All-Stars or award winners, and therefore has to carry the heaviest load for six months. Unless it\u2019s the fellow who so elevates his teammates and coaching staff that they do get recognized with honors and awards of their own. Unless it\u2019s the performer without whom his team would fall the most in the standings, as determined by, uh, our imaginations.\u201d It\u2019s some blend, in other words, of analytics and eye test. And thanks to the eye-of-the-beholder notion of \u201cvaluable,\u201d it is the source of endless debates and thus, unintended ingenuity by the NBA and other leagues. Some sports opt for a \u201cPlayer of the Year\u201d award, which tends to focus more on the individual, stripping away some of the team component. If that were the case in the NBA, Harden might be the easier choice. He is on pace to become the first player in NBA history to average at least 35 points and seven assists in a season (Nate Archibald, in his famous 1972-73 season, led the league in both categories with 34 ppg and 11.4 apg .) He has scored 50 points or more eight times, twice topping 60 . His \u201ciso\u201d offensive style isn\u2019t the most aesthetically pleasing. Harden has improved in both effort and effectiveness on defense, but he set an extremely low bar at that end for much of his career. He carried Houston through a spate of injuries, notably to backcourt mate Chris Paul and big man Chris Capela, and has helped the Rockets to an NBA-best 14-3 mark since the 2019 NBA All-Star. Antetokounmpo\u2019s stats \u2014 27.4 ppg, 12.6 rpg and 6.0 apg \u2014 bolster his case as well, as those numbers were previously matched across the board only by Hall of Famer (and Bucks legend) Oscar Robertson. He\u2019s the league leader in unassisted dunks and sports a career-best field goal percentage this season (58.2 percent). In terms of team, Antetokounmpo has missed three games to knee soreness (or precautions thereof) since the All-Star break, and the Bucks are 12-5. He is a committed defender with his length, mobility and pterodactyl wingspan. Milwaukee has been a wire-to-wire top team, with a league-best 55-19 record \u2014 a gain of 11 victories from 2017-18. Clinching the East\u2019s No. 1 seed might be their primary impediment to winning 60 games. Houston, down from 65-17 to 47-27, already has lost 10 more games than in 2017-18. Without their stars? Milwaukee is 4-3 when Antetokounmpo sits, while Houston is 2-2 without Harden. As far as the load each has carried, Harden\u2019s most renowned teammate is Paul, a perennial All-Star and likely Hall of Famer. But he has played 50 of the 74 games so far, with Capela at 59 and Eric Gordon 60. Antetokounmpo\u2019s crew has been healthier \u2014 the other four starters (Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Brook Lopez and Malcolm Brogdon) have missed a total of 15 games, though Brogdon remains out. Then again, the gap from Kia MVP candidate to next-best player is more precipitous on the Bucks. Middleton, a first-time All-Star this season, was chosen at least in part as a reserve by East coaches as a nod to the team\u2019s record. The home stretch of this season might tilt a few ballots, but it\u2019s important not to weight them too much. Milwaukee has a four-game cushion (and tiebreaker) over the Toronto Raptors. It might rest up and lick its wounds before the postseason. Houston may opt to chase Denver for the No. 2 seed if its mathematically possible. Neither top candidate sounds focused on the MVP trophy, though both surely would be thrilled to win it. \u201cMy thought process on all of that is just to get better,\u201d Antetokounmpo said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to change. I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re playing in The Finals or me being the MVP or whatever. It\u2019s never going to change. It\u2019s always about getting better. It\u2019s worked so far.\u201d Harden told Smith recently: \u201cI\u2019m 10 years in now. The only thing I can really do now is enjoy it, have fun with it and just try to take it game for game and be the best that I can be.\u201d So where is this all headed? Probably toward a too-close-to-call situation with more than the usual suspense. A straw poll by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this weekend of 25 likely voters found 13 votes for Antetokounmpo, 10 for Harden and two undecideds. Since the actual ballot goes five deep, the point system attached to it could produce one of the narrowest margins in recent memory. Which probably would be about right. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The sad story centers on the loss of Blazers\u2019 center Jusuf Nurkic, who crumpled to the floor with a gruesome season-ending left leg injury early in the second overtime. It\u2019s a severe setback for the Trail Blazers\u2019 chances to advance in the playoffs, which start in less than a month, and devastating for the 7-foot Nurkic, who was having a career season with averages of 15.4 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks. Nurkic\u2019s stat line for the night highlights his two-way presence in the paint: He had four blocks in addition to 32 points, 16 rebounds and five assists before being carted off on a gurney. NBA TV analyst David Griffin points out that Nurkic\u2019s defensive ability is what the Blazers will miss most, with backup center Enes Kanter lacking in that area. The Blazers already are dealing with the temporary loss of CJ McCollum, who is recovering from a left knee injury and will not accompany the team on its upcoming four-game road trip. Point guard and team leader Damian Lillard was blunt about the impact of Nurkic\u2019s loss. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, man,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe fight so hard all season long and our starting center, one of our main guys, goes down. On a big night for us, going into the postseason, it looked bad. It\u2019s kind of discouraging to see that. Especially with CJ [McCollum] being out, it\u2019s just another thing. More adversity, it seems like, at the wrong time.\u201d Until Devin Booker heated up in the third quarter, the highlight for the Phoenix Suns was Jimmer Fredette getting a standing ovation from Utah Jazz fans upon his pregame introduction. But that quickly changed as Booker poured in 59 points, including 20 in the third quarter, to make it somewhat interesting even as the Jazz cruised to a 125-92 victory over the Suns . With the win, the Jazz moved into a tie with the Clippers for fifth place in the West. It was the most points scored by any player in Utah, either for the Jazz or a visiting team. With his points total, Booker joins James Harden and Kemba Walker as the players with the most points in a game this season. Harden has scored 61 twice and Kemba Walker dropped 60 on the Sixers back in November. In an attempt to keep Booker from scoring 60-plus, the Jazz triple-teamed Booker during the final minutes and fouled another player with 18.6 seconds left so Booker wouldn\u2019t get another shot attempt. After the play, Booker looked at the Utah bench with a smirk as he walked down the court. It\u2019s not exactly news that Booker needs help if the woeful Suns are going to improve. After Booker, the next-highest scorer for Phoenix was rookie Deandre Ayton with \u2026 nine points. Booker scored 64.1 percent of the Suns\u2019 92 points. Per Elias Sports Bureau, that\u2019s the fifth-highest percentage of a team\u2019s total points in NBA history. Three of the others were recorded by George Mikan in the early \u201950s, prior to the shot-clock era; the remaining one was Kobe Bryant\u2019s 81-point game vs. the Raptors in 2006, when he scored 66.4 percent of the Lakers\u2019 122 points. The scoring disparity was readily apparent in the Suns\u2019 halftime box score. Shades of Dwight Howard: Don\u2019t look now, but the Orlando Magic are making a playoff run. The Magic, 9th in the Eastern Conference standings and only a half-game behind the eighth-seed Heat, completed an unblemished five-game home stand with a convincing 119-98 win over the Phliadelphia 76ers. With a big matchup with the Miami looming Tuesday night , the Magic will be looking to extend their winning streak to six games and get solidly into the playoff mix. Only two games in the loss column separate the Nets, Pistons, Heat and Magic for the sixth through eight spots, with eight games to play for Orlando. \u201cFan are getting behind us, and we\u2019re fighting,\u201d said game-high scorer Nikola Vucevic , who finished with 28 points and 11 rebounds. \u201cGetting into the playoffs would be a huge achievement for us.\u201d The Magic haven\u2019t made the playoffs since the 2011-12 season, when they lost 4-1 in the first round to the Indiana Pacers. On the losing side of the ledger, the already playoff-bound Sixers looked lackluster. In fairness, they were playing without Ben Simmons, who sat out with a stomach virus. After surging the past couple of weeks, Philadelphia \u2014 No. 3 in the East \u2014 has hit a little rough patch, losing to two teams that they should have handled, the Hawks in a tough one on Saturday night and Monday night\u2019s debacle. It illustrates how hard it is to win on the road in the NBA. The Sixers were in the game at halftime, but went without a field goal over a 12-minute stretch in the second half and never recovered. Jonathan Isaac helped get the Magic flowing in the first quarter with this nice transition dunk: Bravo for Bruno  NBA G League standout Bruno Caboclo turned in an NBA career-high 24-point performance as the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 115-103 , playing spoiler to a playoff team. The skidding Thunder have lost five of their last six and are in a battle to avoid the No. 8 seed in the West and a first-round matchup with the Warriors or Nuggets. Easy to overlook in the Suns-Jazz tilt was the fact that center Rudy Gobert passed the aforementioned Dwight Howard for the single-season record for most dunks. Gobert slammed home six on the night and moved to 274 on the season. This pint-sized fan got a thrill \u2014 the chance to assist the Jazz\u2019s Donovan Mitchell in pregame warm-up."},{"id":46514,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-cal-ramsey-obituary-knicks","date":"2019-03-26","title":"Former Knicks, NYU player Cal Ramsey dies at 81","content":" NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Cal Ramsey, who starred at NYU in the 1950s and went on to play and broadcast for the New York Knicks, died Monday.

But no seed in the West is nearly as locked up as the top three seeds in the East. Golden State and Denver both have 23 losses, Houston and Portland both have 27, and teams No. 5-8 all have 30 or 31. With apologies to those Western Conference video coordinators, we may not know who\u2019s playing whom until the last night of the season. Of course, things can change quickly. The top five teams in the Power Rankings, however, are the same as they were last week. Note: For the 12 teams no longer in the playoff picture (the bottom five in the East and the bottom seven in the West), it\u2019s time to start recapping the season. This week\u2019s notes for those teams will be focused on their offense, and we\u2019ll dig into their defense next week.

The fun. The fame. People filling the building wearing your jersey. One day it\u2019s the highest of highs. The next \u2026 it\u2019s all gone. Faried was a cult figure early in his NBA career in Denver. \u201cThe Manimal\u201d was beloved by Nuggets fans at Pepsi Center as they donned his No. 35 jersey and wore dreadlock wigs in honor of the undersized, non-stop big man. He was at the top of his game in the summer of 2014, a part of the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team that won a gold at the FIBA World Cup. Faried could count Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins among his U.S. teammates. After making the All-Tournament team, he signed a four-year, $50 million extension with the Nuggets in October 2014 as a seeming staple of the franchise\u2019s future. That never happened. Friction with a new coach, Faried\u2019s injuries, the rise of young bigs (Nikola Jokic and Jusuf Nurkic) and an All-Star free agent pickup (Paul Millsap) made Faried basically an afterthought. Traded to Brooklyn in July of 2018, Faried played in just 12 games there before agreeing to a buyout in January. By then, Faried was unsure of his future in the league. Yet the timing turned out to be perfect. The Houston Rockets needed someone to help them survive in the post after center Clint Capela\u2019s thumb injury sidelined him more than a month . \u201cThe Manimal\u201d has been revived in Houston, making an instant impact playing off Chris Paul and reigning Kia MVP James Harden. With solid stats (13.6 points per game, 8.8 rebounds per game), he\u2019s eager to contribute however he can for a playoff team. Faried sat down with NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith in a wide-ranging interview, discussing his journey, the Rockets\u2019 finish to 2018-19 and the looming playoffs. * * * Sekou Smith:  You had a nickname, people coming to the arena with your jersey on and everything. Did it bother you how quickly that all went away in Denver without you getting a chance to have a say in how things played out? Kenneth Faried:  Yeah, it felt like a slap in the face to me, to be honest with you. All the hard work and the time you put it in. It was like Isaiah Thomas when he was in Boston . The hard work and the grit and you\u2019re hurt or something out of your control happens, you are still there to play basketball and I understand that. But at the same time, you\u2019ve got a lot of outside stresses going on. For me, it was \u2018hey, I hurt my back one season and I\u2019m still trying to fight through it.\u2019 And we still wanted to go to the playoffs but didn\u2019t make it. So, let me fight through this and, come to find out, at the end of the season, I have a tear in the top of my gluteus maximus. On the right side I caught a tear and they were like, \u2018you tore this and it was pretty bad.\u2019 Talking about surgery and everything. But I didn\u2019t do that. I did rehab. And it was like, \u2018hey Denver, I did that rehab, worked out all summer and I\u2019m ready.\u2019 They said \u2018no, we really don\u2019t care, we brought in Paul Millsap over you.\u2019 And that\u2019s after bringing in [Nikola Jokic] and [Jusuf] Nurkic and trying to play them together. And I\u2019m sitting there looking like \u2018hey, I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still a four-man and can you give me a chance?\u2019 I\u2019m going to prove everybody wrong. I didn\u2019t fall off. I didn\u2019t stop working. I kept working. But I just don\u2019t have the opportunity. And coaches just didn\u2019t believe in me. And now everybody\u2019s so surprised that I\u2019ve re-emerged, this new me. And no, I\u2019ve been here the whole time. I just happened to fall into a situation where the coaches believed in me. SS:  So it was just a matter of confidence from Mike D\u2019Antoni and his staff and an opportunity for you to get right back being, for the lack of a better word, \u201cThe Manimal?\u201d KF:  Yeah. I\u2019ve had this. It\u2019s just now I have the confidence from the coach. Yeah, they want me to be confident. They want me to shoot the mid-range, want me to drive my man and do the stuff you know how to do and have been working on your whole career. There\u2019s no problem. So I\u2019m like okay coach, let me do my thing.  SS:  Is it hard to figure out who you guys are as a group, given all the transition that\u2019s gone on with this team this season? And how long does it take to get everybody up to speed and ready for that playoff push? KF:  It shouldn\u2019t take that long because all of these guys on this team have been here for a bit. And coach is implementing everything we need, telling guys exactly what he needs from them. The information comes fast. But as a player you should already know a lot of the information. You made it here for a reason. You should already have a high IQ and that there\u2019s a difference between regular season and playoff intensity. And if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to learn real fast on this team. With leaders like Chris and James, you\u2019re going to know that I can\u2019t make the same mistakes I made in the regular season in the playoffs, because each and every possession matters. And we know that. I know that. I\u2019ve been in the playoffs before. I\u2019ve seen the three-seed like we were in Denver, go down to the six-seed in the Warriors and they\u2019ve taken off the way they have since then, so I respect it. I respect this process we\u2019re going through right now. SS:  Is this the part of the journey that does feel like a career reboot for you, knowing you\u2019re going to be competing on a playoff team, with a group that truly believes they can do something special? KF:  Absolutely. Me being on this team is a blessing because it gave me new life to my career. People see Kenneth Faried can do this and Kenneth Faried can do that. And Houston is letting him do this and letting him do that. So I give coach D\u2019Antoni a ton of credit for that, and a ton of respect for letting, not just me but also James Harden be who he is, Chis Paul be who he is, Clint Capela be who he is. I mean, Austin Rivers, he\u2019s got him over here letting him be who he is after everybody thought he was down and out when he went to Washington. But he\u2019s back on track. Gerald Green, P.J. Tucker \u2026 think about where all these guys have come from. And now you\u2019ve got a strong group that\u2019s confident and knows how to get the job done. A group that knows what it takes to be in this league and is going to bring the grit and heart to the floor each and every night. SS:  Knowing the Rockets\u2019 history of taking guys who come from tough situations and flourish once they get in D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system make you feel good about this being the right spot for you to reboot things? KF:  I felt really good coming here because [D\u2019Antoni] is one of those coaches who really allows you the freedom offensively to play and then expects you to be on top of your game as a professional in every aspect. Whatever the scheme is, whatever the program is, that\u2019s on you to be on point. But offensively, he lets us all play free and loose. If he sees you working on your 3-point shot and working your tail off on your game, he\u2019s going to encourage you to do the same things in a game. He knows that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get better is to take those things you\u2019re working on and know what it feels like to have that success. The bottom line is he\u2019s going to give you a chance. It\u2019s up to you, though, what you do with that chance. SS:  That was made clear to you when they signed you? KF:  When I first came here they let me know they were going to play me off the bench behind Nene that first game so I could get acclimated. Cool. Then it was \u2018now we\u2019re going to start you because Capela\u2019s gone, so you better figure it out.\u2019 So I had to figure it out when I got out there. And I did.  SS:  How strange was it to see the reaction from people when you hit the floor in that Rockets uniform and played well, for people to see that you still had something left in the tank after being almost invisible the last couple of years? KF:  It felt great. Really. When I was first able to step on the floor knowing you\u2019re going to play minutes, you know, not 20 minutes one night and then not play in 10 straight games or something like five minutes in a blowout or spot duty because somebody is hurt. No, you\u2019re going to play meaningful minutes and each and every possession you\u2019re out there matters. So for me, that felt amazing. It was like a rejuvenation, like wow, a coach trusts me to be out here again to play my position, whatever it is, to guard my position and to score the ball. And really no matter what I\u2019m doing out there, just being out there to help my teammates and to give them my real energy and getting the crowd into it, diving on the floor for loose balls, jumping up for rebounds, creating extra possessions and doing all the little things, that\u2019s fun to me. That\u2019s fun, being a team player, that\u2019s fun to be a part of again. I love basketball because of that reason. Everybody gets a chance to shine doing what they do, it\u2019s never just one guy. It\u2019s always about the team.  SS:  This is a Houston team that\u2019s been through it. Game 7 was on their home floor last year in the Western Conference finals. They know who they are and what they are capable of. What does that look like internally for you, stepping into that sort of situation the way you have? KF:  Seriousness. It\u2019s all seriousness. Everybody is locked in. Every game is a playoff game for us. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re focusing. And that goes for everybody, whether you\u2019re in the rotation on a given night or not. You focus on your job and everybody comes together \u2026 because we\u2019re going to need all 12 guys in some capacity every single night. SS:  You\u2019d also appear to have a little more pent up energy than the next guy, given what your path has been here recently. KF:  I think I\u2019ve got way more energy than the next guy. But I\u2019ve always been that guy. No one can ever say that I didn\u2019t bring that. I\u2019ve always had to bring that because no one ever thought I should be here anyway. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be on that team [in Spain], wasn\u2019t even supposed to make it. But hey, I\u2019ve been defying odds my whole career. And I\u2019m going to keep doing it. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Nuggets scored another big, post-All-Star break win, this time taking down the Celtics on the road Monday night. The win was a two-fold moment for Denver, as it clinched a playoff spot for it (the Nuggets\u2019 first since 2012-13) and, for the moment, moved them to No. 1 in the Western Conference. Spurs 111, Warriors 105 \u2014 Death, taxes and winning seasons in San Antonio. These are all inevitable, it seems. The Spurs won their ninth straight game overall (and 11th straight game at home) on Monday, clinching their 22nd straight winning season. A little more than a month removed from their worst Rodeo Road Trip ever, San Antonio is looking sharp as the season winds down. Pelicans 129, Mavericks 125 (OT) \u2014 Sorry, New Orleans, but being in this spot has nothing to do with your win. This battle of lottery-bound squads gets a nod for the historical impact. Dirk Nowitzki nailed his first two shots to open this game, the second of which pushed him past Wilt Chamberlain for sixth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. It was a game and moment worth watching again before 2018-19 disappears. Rockets 121, Hawks 105 \u2014 It was not a stretch to say before this game that Houston was expected to win (which is precisely what happened Monday). But it might have been a stretch to say before the season that James Harden would log a 30-point game against every team in 2018-19 (which is also what happened Monday). Another milestone moment in a season of them for the Rockets\u2019 superstar guard \u2026 Nets 123, Kings 121  \u2014 Brooklyn had trailed Sacramento by as many as 28 points on Tuesday. Then, it used a monster fourth quarter from D\u2019Angelo Russell (27 points in that frame) completed the fourth-largest fourth-quarter comeback since the advent of the shot clock. It couldn\u2019t have come at a better time as the Nets were in the midst of a three-game slide and fading fast in the Eastern Conference playoff chase. Sixers 118, Celtics 115 \u2014 This one had all the traits of a playoff game, as Philadelphia got a much-needed win against their rivals from Boston. Although it did nothing to affect the season series \u2014 the Celtics won that, 3-1 \u2014 it did give Philadelphia some much needed confidence that it can beat Boston should the teams meet in the postseason. Nets 111, Lakers 106 \u2014 Although D\u2019Angelo Russell said he did not take any particular joy in Friday\u2019s win against his former team, surely there was a small part of him that did. In powering Brooklyn past the Lakers, Russell and Co. gave LeBron James and the Lakers the loss that clinched them being left out of the 2019 postseason party. Rockets 111, Spurs 105 \u2014 Add another chapter to this storied rivalry, thanks to the scoring exploits of James Harden. He dropped 61 on San Antonio, marking his eighth 50-point game of the season (compared with 10 such performances from the rest of the league combined). Not only that, but his barrage of late 3-pointers powered Houston to the win after it trailed much of Friday night\u2019s game. Thunder 116, Raptors 109 \u2014 With their fate as a top seed in the Western Conference fading, Oklahoma City got its groove back Friday behind Russell Westbrook. He came through with 18 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds to power a comeback win that snapped a four-game skid for the Thunder. Hawks 129, Sixers 127 \u2014 Atlanta isn\u2019t about to believe the idea that losing down the stretch of 2018-19 is in its best interests. After rallying to beat the Jazz on Thursday night, the Hawks worked their magic again on Saturday. Rookie Trae Young delivered the final blow to the Sixers, sinking a thrilling floater with :00.1 left that put away Philadelphia. Hornets 115, Raptors 114 \u2014 Buzzer-beater of the season? We\u2019ll leave that up to you to decide. However you categorize Jeremy Lamb\u2019s shot Sunday against Toronto, know this: it was crucial in keeping Charlotte\u2019s playoff hopes from fading further. And, fittingly, it came on a day when buzzer-beaters and wild shots regularly take the spotlight (albeit those come in the 2019 NCAA Tournament, not the NBA) \u2026 Nikola Jokic (21 points, 9-14 FG, 13 reb, 7 ast, 2 stl, 3 blk in 36 minutes) \u2014 In a game that had playoff-like moments and a playoff-like feel to it, Jokic came through like a playoff go-to guy should. His steadying hand on the offense and his always stellar court vision helped Denver fend off Boston\u2019s many runs in a standout win for the Nuggets. | Watch | Video box score Dirk Nowitzki (8 points, 3-6 FG, 1 reb, 2 ast in 12 minutes) \u2014 Never has a stat line in this space said so much with so few numbers. This one, though, isn\u2019t about the big performance but rather, the big moment. Nowitzki was up for the task, passing Wilt Chamberlain with his second field goal \u2014 a trademark fadeaway jumper \u2014 that further cemented his place in NBA history. | Watch | Video box score D\u2019Angelo Russell (44 points, 17-33 FG, 4 reb, 12 ast, 4 stl in 38 minutes) \u2014 After scoring 17 points in the first half and going without a point in the third quarter, Russell shot 10 of 15 in the fourth quarter. In one stretch, scored 16 straight points. Overall, this was a case study as to why Russell was an All-Star and one of the league\u2019s best scoring guards. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (57 points, 18-39 FG, 9-17 3-pt FG, 7 reb, 8 ast, 2 stl, 2 blk in 45 minutes) \u2014 The Rockets are pretty much always in any game they play, and this Houston loss on Wednesday to Memphis proved that. Harden pushed the Rockets to overtime with his scoring exploits, all while logging his second 50-point game against Memphis this season. Although the Rockets ultimately lost, 126-125, you can\u2019t help but give Harden a nod for his all-out effort. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (61 points, 19-34 FG, 9-13 3-pt FG, 7 reb, 3 stl in 37 minutes) \u2014 Two nights after a 50-point effort went for naught, Harden wasn\u2019t about to let that happen again. He had 15 of his 61 points in the fourth quarter and, as he\u2019s done so many times this season, single-handedly put away a team with relentless scoring. | Watch | Video box score Luka Doncic (23 points, 6-14 FG, 11 reb, 10 ast, 3 stl in 27 minutes) \u2014 The Mavericks have enjoyed a bevy of fantastic performances from their rookie guard all season, and Saturday was another one for that list. In a showdown with the defending NBA champs at Oracle Arena, Doncic had his way with the Stephen Curry-less Warriors. And, if he ends up coming back next season, Dirk Nowitzki showed he has something left in the tank (21 points on 8-for-14 shooting). | Watch | Video box score LaMarcus Aldridge (48 points, 20-31 FG, 13 reb, 6 ast in 37 minutes) \u2014 Lovers of the jump shot, Aldridge is still here for you. In an era where big men are deemed useless if they can\u2019t nail 3-pointers, Aldridge showed the Boston Celtics on Sunday that\u2019s not true at all. While his shot chart reflected that of Karl Malone in 1996, the Celtics had nothing for him all game long. | Watch | Video box score  \u201cOnce you get in that groove it\u2019s hard to get you out of it. No matter what defense a team throws at you, you\u2019re going to find a way to get it done. That\u2019s kind of what it was.\u201d \u2014 Nets guard D\u2019Angelo Russell , after his epic fourth quarter barrage Tuesday vs. Sacramento \u201cHe made a tough shot. I don\u2019t know how I could have defended it better. Yeah, March Madness.\u201d \u2014 Raptors forward Pascal Siakam , on Jeremy Lamb\u2019s game-winning heave Sunday over him \u201cYesss sir! We\u2019re just going to take this. We\u2019re going to take a moment to realize how far we\u2019ve come.

We need to get a lot better.\u201d \u2014 Celtics coach Brad Stevens , after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Spurs \u201cSounds good on paper, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re not playing themd. We\u2019re not competing against them for seeding, so the win is good enough.\u201d \u2014 Nets guard D\u2019Angelo Russell , after his team\u2019s win on Friday eliminated the Lakers from playoff contention \u201cIf I\u2019m on the floor, I\u2019ve got to try to play as hard as I can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game. So if I\u2019m out on the floor, if I\u2019m in uniform, then I\u2019ve got to try to make things happen.\u201d \u2014 Lakers forward LeBron James \u201cHe deserves everything good that happens to him. It\u2019s amazing the things he has accomplished, but this one is really amazing for him.\u201d \u2014 Mavericks rookie Luka Doncic, on Dirk Nowitzki passing Wilt Chamberlain on the all-time scoring list. \u201cIf you play long enough, 10 rebounds will fall in your lap.\u201d \u2014 Sixers guard JJ Redick , who on Tuesday got his first double-double after 826 career games \u201cWe got back to our swag, how we play.\u201d \u2014 Thunder guard Dennis Schroder , after Friday\u2019s win vs. Toronto. \u201cWe\u2019re all heroes.

While that result couldn\u2019t change the Lakers\u2019 postseason fate \u2014 they\u2019re officially out of the 2019 mix \u2014 going through the motions was not an option for LeBron James. The Lakers star netted a triple-double ( 29 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists ) to power the victory and told Spectrum SportsNet after the win that doing anything less than that would be unacceptable. \u201cI would never cheat myself,\u201d James said . \u201cI know we\u2019re out the playoff race, but if I\u2019m on the court, I\u2019m going to play how I play, and I play to win. So, I never will cheat the game. There\u2019s such a thing called \u2018game gods.\u2019 And they\u2019re watching no matter what you\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s our obligation to go out and be a professional, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m about. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long season and it\u2019s not gone the way we would like it, obviously. Our fans are still showing up. So it\u2019s our obligation to go out and show them what we do in practice and in film sessions and hopefully it results in wins.\u201d The Lakers snapped a five-game losing streak, but their last loss \u2014 a 111-106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Friday \u2014 officially eliminated them from the playoff chase. To James, though, he owed it to the fans to give them his best whenever it is possible. \u201cIf I\u2019m on the floor, I\u2019ve got to try to play as hard as I can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game,\u201d said James, who had 12 points and three assists in the fourth quarter. \u201cSo if I\u2019m out on the floor, if I\u2019m in uniform, then I\u2019ve got to try to make things happen. \u201cNot saying I\u2019m going to make every shot, not saying I\u2019m going to make every play or not have any turnovers. But just try to make an impact on the game and, like I said, I was on the floor tonight, and I was able to make a couple plays to help make our team win.\u201d Lakers coach Luke Walton told reporters after Sunday\u2019s game that even in a lost season such as this, he has stressed to his players the good fortune they all have by being in the NBA. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the team about it a lot, as far as it being an honor and a privilege to play in this league, and we\u2019re coaching in this league, for all of us,\u201d Walton said . \u201cThis game of basketball has allowed us to have incredible opportunities in life. So, that\u2019s been more the message to the group. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to \u2018Bron sporadically throughout the season. But the thing \u2014 he knows it. And I think he takes it very serious. He\u2019s been the face of the NBA for however many years now. He\u2019s aware of that, and I think he takes that responsibility, he takes it very seriously.\u201d In a post on his Instagram, James made it clear to Lakers fans he doesn\u2019t plan on the team\u2019s playoff absence being a regular occurrence on his watch going forward. He wrote: \u201cBelieve me! Promise #LakerNation the spell won\u2019t last much longer! I swear. The marathon continues!\u201d Per ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin , James is on a suggested 32-minute guideline after his right knee swelled up from slipping on the floor in Friday\u2019s final possession vs. the Nets. James played 35 minutes on Sunday and was asked if respecting the basketball gods will factor into how much he plays in the Lakers\u2019 final nine games of 2018-19. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t factor into that; it factors in when I\u2019m on the floor,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to continue to see how my body feels when I\u2019m on the floor. Like I said, I didn\u2019t feel great today, but I felt good enough to go out there, and I just trusted myself and trusted my decision.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":34824,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-3-24-19","date":"2019-03-25","title":"About Last Night: Hornets earn another miracle","content":" Less than 24 hours after erasing an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Celtics, the Hornets needed another miracle, this time against the second-place Raptors. Charlotte\u2019s prayer was answered 48 feet from the basket, where Jeremy Lamb\u2019s heave saved the game and his team\u2019s season with all the magical arc of a rainbow to give the Hornets the 115-114 victory. It\u2019s been a twisted NBA road for Lamb, the once highly regarded lottery pick traded twice before his rookie contract expired. He\u2019s still not the perfect solution for the extremely imperfect Hornets, who have relied on Kemba Walker\u2019s greatness to just stay afloat in the Eastern Conference. Lamb is shooting just 34.1 percent from deep this season, down from the career-high 37 percent clip he produced in 2017-18. That being said, Lamb has still been a net positive. The Hornets\u2019 net rating is 3.3 points better with him on the floor, where his reputation still keeps defenses honest. On a team that struggles to supply consistent offense aside from Walker, Lamb (Charlotte\u2019s second-leading scorer) is perhaps their only other candidate to go off for a big night. On Sunday, he gave Charlotte a big moment \u2014 and a lifeline to their playoff hopes. As always, we rate game-winning buzzer-beaters on our Horry Scale. Reminder: The Horry Scale breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. DIFFICULTY: Pascal Siakam hounded Lamb from the start of the out-of-bounds play, and even managed to poke the ball loose toward halfcourt. Forced to retreat and retrieve the ball, Lamb had no choice but to launch with Siakam still draped all over him. The Raptors\u2019 forward is a good four inches taller than Lamb and boasts an absurd 7-foot-3 wingspan, which forced the Hornets guard to add an enormous arc to the shot. It should have had zero chance of going in. \u201cWhen I first shot it, it felt good, but in my head I was thinking, \u2018It\u2019s too good to be true if it does go in,'\u201d Lamb admitted afterwards. \u201cI never in a million years thought it would go in. I thought it\u2019d get close, but to see it go in, it was unreal.\u201d GAME SITUATION:  There are few things more deflating than the opposing team\u2019s star player taking cool control of the game. Kawhi Leonard had just hit a key jumper and blocked a Kemba Walker floater on back-to-back possessions. Zoom out, and the Hornets\u2019 situation was even more dire. Lose, and Charlotte trails eighth-place Miami by three games with nine to play. The Hornets\u2019 playoff hopes were on life support. Lamb kept their pulse alive a little longer. CELEBRATION: Lamb raced to the other side of the court, but that didn\u2019t stop his teammates from catching up to and mobbing their Sunday-night savior. More touching was the renewal of team embraces after they appeared to have ended. Walker was among the most effusive congratulators, and for good reason. The Hornets\u2019 franchise face has enjoyed just two playoff appearances in his seven prior seasons, with the most recent already four years in his rearview mirror. GRADE: What a weekend for Charlotte. Back-to-back wins over Boston and Toronto in dramatic fashion, capped off by the second-longest buzzer-beater over the last 20 years (per ESPN Stats & Info). 4.5 Horrys . Lost amid the Spurs\u2019 shattered transition from the Duncan dynasty to the Kawhi era is how LaMarcus Aldridge has kept San Antonio\u2019s 21-year playoff run alive. His first two years with the Spurs seemed awkward, and his numbers seemed to indicate the former Blazer was headed for a steep decline. Instead, Aldridge is enjoying a rare resurgence well into his 30s, earning a seventh All-Star appearance while averaging 21.0 points and 8.9 rebounds and shooting a career-high 51.5 percent. Boston was the latest victim of Aldridge\u2019s efficiency, which produced 48 points in the Spurs\u2019 115-96 rout. Many assumed the Pacers would fade following Victor Oladipo\u2019s season-ending quad injury in January. Defense is one big reason why they have not. The other is Bojan Bogdanovic, who torched Denver\u2019s top-10 defense for 35 points on just 16 shots.  The former second-round pick \u2014 who was traded twice on 2011 Draft night and again in 2017 \u2014 assumed the role of Indiana\u2019s go-to guy since Oladipo went down. The results: 21.3 points per game on 50.9 percent shooting, including 40.3 percent from 3. The only other players with that combination of production and efficiency since January 25: Karl-Anthony Towns, Pascal Siakam and Brandon Ingram. The Pacers need every bit of Super Bojan; they\u2019re 24th in offense since Oladipo went down. Yet Boston, their likely first-round opponent, has been a middle-of-the-pack team on both ends of the court in that same stretch. If Indy\u2019s top-five defense holds up and Bogdanovic continues to boil, the Pacers will be anything but an easy out come April. In many ways, the 1977-78 season was the Year of the Rookies. New Jersey\u2019s Bernard King and Phoenix\u2019s Walter Davis each averaged 24.2 points per game. Jack Sikma started for a Finals team in Seattle. Norm Nixon injected playmaking and pace into the previously plodding Lakers. Marques Johnson was another significant member of that group, and the herald of renewed competitiveness for the post-Kareem Bucks. The former No. 3 overall pick averaged 19.5 points and 10.6 rebounds his rookie season, an appetizer of the high-scoring efficiency he would bring to Milwaukee for his first seven years in the league. The five-time All-Star received his due on Sunday when the Bucks raised his No. 8 to the rafters. It\u2019s easy to see why many Bucks fans felt the wait had already been too long; aside from his individual accomplishments, Johnson was a member of back-to-back conference finalist teams \u2014 a place Milwaukee has been just once since Johnson\u2019s last year with the Bucks (1984). Johnson\u2019s appreciation for those fans and his time with the Bucks was evident in a video letter in which he stated, \u201cI want to say thank you for embracing me as one of your own, even when I didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d He did then. He does now. Congratulations, Marques."},{"id":34807,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jeremy-lamb-buzzer-beater-writeup","date":"2019-03-25","title":"Lamb's half-court heave beats buzzer, Raptors","content":"With the Hornets\u2019 playoff hopes hanging by a threat, Jeremy Lamb\u2019s buzzer-beating prayer was answered.

The Celtics were cruising. In a game they had led from the eighth minute against an opponent that entered Saturday night on a 6-13 slide, Boston\u2019s lead peaked at 18 with 8:55 remaining. Beyond that peak? Sheer cliffs. Dizzying heights. And a baller from the Bronx not quite ready to watch his season sink into the sun-drenched seas. To their credit, it took nearly two minutes for the Hornets to take advantage. Jeremy Lamb missed a hook. Kemba Walker missed a 3. Then, with 7:43 to play, Walker hit one. From those humble beginnings, Charlotte\u2019s All-Star tapped into his deep well of March magnificence, igniting a game-ending 30-5 run with 18 points and single-handedly keeping the Hornets\u2019 floundering playoff hopes alive. \u201cJust wanted to win,\u201d Walker said in the postgame interview on court. \u201cAnd the young guys, much credit to those guys, they played so well tonight. Marvin [Williams] made some huge plays. Everybody who came in tonight made some huge plays and that was a huge win for us.\u201d With 10 games to play, the Hornets kept pace with No. 8 seed Miami, who held off the Wizards 113-108. The Magic sit between them after winning four straight; the Heat are 7-3 in their last 10 and finally healthy. This needs to be the beginning of something for Charlotte to truly charge into the playoffs. But if anyone can be trusted with that finishing kick, it\u2019s the three-time All-Star who sent the Celtics into another mini-crisis. Cue Kyrie: \u201cIt\u2019s 1-on-1,\u201d Irving said. \u201cYou have pride. Down the stretch, try to come in and help as much as possible. We probably should\u2019ve tried to trap him more, like every other team does in the league. But we didn\u2019t. He torches us every time. It\u2019s no surprise.\u201d [INSERTS GRIMACE EMOJI X A MILLION] Aaaaand scene. We\u2019ll be processing the fallout from that one with y\u2019all tomorrow. The Trae Young traveling circus has been trick-dribbling and dialing long-distance for months now. On Saturday, the Hawks turned back the Sixers on Young\u2019s last-second bucket , another highlight for the season reel. But first, just as it looked like Philadelphia would hold off the rally, Joel Embiid crossed himself up and Kevin Huerter took wild liberties with the ensuing fast break: We see you on the dunk, young fella. Staring down Jimmy Butler and earning his forever wrath is probably not worth it for this late regular-season spoiler upset before you go on vacay. But even after he dunks on your family just to prove a point, you can think back on all the texts rolling in this once and smile from the ground. In any case, that set up an exchange (two free throws for a layup) before the Hawks locked down to force a shot clock violation and set up Young for a final shot. Huerter smoothly hit him with the inbounds pass, and Young quickly cut back toward the basket, beating Jimmy Butler to his right hand and a clear line to shoot. Nothing but net \u2013 a swish and a shower. The shot,and its accompanying 32-point, six-rebound, 11-assist line didn\u2019t go unnoticed around the #NBATwitter streets: The case is there to be made, and that\u2019s a strong dual co-sign for young Trae. But it\u2019s complicated by things like this: Yep. The Mavericks beat the champs behind a triple-double from the Slovenian sensation, Luka Doncic. And Dirk Nowitzki showed he still has some left in the tank with five 3-pointers en route to 21 points against the Warriors. Hey, remember when it actually seemed like the Pistons might have a chance against Portland? Me neither. Good talk, see you out there. Sure, the Bulls lost to the Jazz by 30-plus. That\u2019s a thing! But so is this: The web shooter hands! True commitment to the costume.

Meanwhile, the King\u2019s buddy in South Beach and 2016-17 champion has made a big late-season push and finds himself back in the chase for the first time in a while. At the other end of the spectrum, it looks like Marc Gasol\u2019s presence in the chase is over \u2014 at least for 2018-19. 1. LeBron James (34), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 4 games, 32.0 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 7.5 apg Season stats: 27.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 8.0 apg Go ahead, LeBron. Sit out the rest of the games. You\u2019ve already clinched this baby, becoming the first back-to-back OSPR champ. But knowing his competitive juices, he\u2019ll probably still get out there for a handful of games, probably delivering some more 30-point efforts (safe bet, considering he has four in the last five games) and maybe even another triple-double. 2. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 6 games, 24.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 4.3 apg Season stats: 20.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.3 apg Williams started the stretch on absolute fire, turning in a 40-point effort and a 34-point showing. Over the next four games, he tapered off, turning in two games of fewer than 20 points, though he managed to score 21 and 25 in the two other. It was definitely a strong enough showing to break free of Aldridge and claim the No. 2 spot all to himself. 3. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2a Latest stats:  6 games, 21.2 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 1.8 apg Season stats: 21.1 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 2.4 apg Only once in the last six games Aldridge scored less than 17 points, going for 12 (5-for-13 shooting) on March 16. In fact, that was also the only game he shot less than 50 percent from the field. In addition to the scoring, we\u2019ve taken notice of the rebounding, which has picked up to the tune of 10.0 in March compared to 8.9 in February and 8.3 in January. 4. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 4 games, 16.5 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 9.0 apg Season stats: 14.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 9.0 apg Despite missing some time with an ankle injury, Lowry did enough in his four games to maintain his position. That\u2019s almost expected when you start off the stint with your second triple-double of the season. He followed that up with a 24-point, 10-assist performance in a win over the Heat. We\u2019ve also noticed the touch from deep \u2014 hitting 50 percent (18-for-36) in the last four. 5. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 7 games, 14.7 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 7.4 apg Season stats: 15.6 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 8.2 apg Paul started the stint with a stinker against the 76ers, managing just four points on 2-for-8 shooting. He followed that with a relative stinker against the Mavericks (nine points on 2-for-11 shooting, but added nine dimes). Then things turned around, going for 24 and 25 while shooting a combined 15-for-24 (62.5 percent). He\u2019s also gone for seven or more assists in three straight. 6. Paul Millsap (34), Denver Nuggets Previous rank: 7 Latest stats: 6 games, 17.8 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.7 apg Season stats: 13.1 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 1.9 apg Like Paul, Millsap started the stint in ugly fashion, going for nine points on 3-for-8 shooting in a loss to the Warriors. Also like Paul, he rebounded nicely, going for 23 and a season-high 33 over the next two. Two of the last three games were efficient double-doubles. All in all, it was a solid shooting period for Millsap, who shot 61.5 FG% and 45.0 3PT% in the six games. 7. Dwyane Wade (36), Miami Heat Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 7 games, 14.4 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 2.6 apg Season stats: 14.2 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 4.1 apg Welcome back to the chase, former champ . For the first time since Weeks 7-8 , Wade sees himself in the Top 10. It\u2019s with good reason, as he\u2019s gone for double-digit scoring in seven straight, eclipsing 15 three times. It would take a run of 20 and 30-point games, but it would be something to see Wade crack the top five in his final NBA season. 8. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 7 games, 15.9 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 3.1 apg Season stats: 17.8 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.8 apg Like Paul and Millsap, Redick started slowly, turning in back-to-back games of less than 10 points for the first time this season. He did score 17 or more in the next five games, though he failed to crack 43 percent from the field in three of them. Over the last seven games, Redick is actually shooting better from beyond the arc (45.0) then from the field (39.3). 9. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Previous rank: 8 Latest stats: 6 games, 13.8 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 4.7 apg Season stats: 13.2 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 4.1 apg Unspectacular yet steady is how we can describe Horford\u2019s last six games \u2014 and really, his entire season. He\u2019s gone for double-figure scoring in five games, with the last two eclipsing 20 points. But the first four games were bland, all between nine and 12 points with just one game of more than six rebounds. In fact, Horford has only gone for 10 or more boards once in the last 13. 10. Goran Dragic (32), Miami Heat Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 7 games, 14.7 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 4.0 apg Season stats: 15.2 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 4.2 apg After missing a big chunk of the season with a knee injury, Dragic appears to be close to 100 percent and finding his game. Too bad there\u2019s only a handful of games remaining. He\u2019s scored 19 or more in three straight and has gone for double-figure scoring in six of the last seven. In fact, Monday\u2019s 26-11 effort in a win over OKC may have been his best performance this season.

He\u2019s got 27.\u201d By this point, it was already the middle of the NBA evening. Many assumed it was first-half news, to which the reply couldn\u2019t type itself fast enough. \u201cNo, no\u2026 in the first quarter.\u201d It was true. James Harden had already burned the previously scorching Spurs for 27 points in the game\u2019s first 12 minutes. Yet even as he scored \u201cjust\u201d 10 and nine points in the second and third quarters, respectively, the Spurs\u2019 collective seemed on the verge of overcoming Houston\u2019s Kia MVP candidate. Then Harden buckled in for one more surge, a fourth-quarter push that included this back-breaking banker to put Houston up three after they trailed by as many as 19 in the second half. Behind Harden\u2019s 61 points , Houston pulled away for the 111-105 win. Like his signature step-back 3-pointer, that game-swinging banker is a terrible shot for anyone but Harden, just as his load distribution would seem terrible for any team but Houston. His usage rating against the Spurs was 53.7 percent \u2014 the fourth time he\u2019s exceeded 50 percent in 2018-19. Klay Thompson is the only other player to shoulder more than 50 percent usage in a game this season. That, in a nutshell, will be Harden\u2019s MVP case to voters in just three short weeks. He is the Rockets\u2019 Atlas, only he\u2019s scoring 60-plus with the big ball instead of merely carrying it. Friday\u2019s 61-point performance (combined with his 57-point special on Wednesday) punctuated that image, one supported by a stream of impressive stats, facts and short lists. Among them: Everyone will take notice, if for different reasons. Harden supporters and detractors will scream point and counterpoint to each other while voters scramble to find the truth beneath the noise. The Bucks felt compelled to remind the NBA world of their own MVP candidate just minutes after Houston\u2019s win: Until the votes are cast and their results made, simply marveling over Harden\u2019s historic shot-making will have to be enough. Entering Friday\u2019s action, four teams were tied in the Western Conference playoff picture , while the bottom of the East was still very much up for grabs. Here\u2019s a brief look at what happened and the ripple-effect in the standings: Magic 123, Grizzlies 119 Orlando avoided catastrophe with a late-game comeback before eking out the win in OT. A four-game winning streak has the Magic just a half-game out of the eighth and final playoff spot out East. Clippers 110, Cavaliers 108 L.A.\u2019s playoff-bound team also avoided embarrassment, overcoming a slow first-half to ultimately edge the league\u2019s third-worst team. Combined with the Spurs\u2019 loss to Houston, the win was enough to push the Clippers to a tie for fifth with Oklahoma City. Nuggets 111, Knicks 93 By quickly dispatching the lottery-bound Knicks, Denver re-established a tie for first with Golden State. The Nuggets have lost two of three to the Warriors this season making their April 2 meeting a must-win for tiebreaker purposes. Thunder 116, Raptors 109 Oklahoma City snapped its four-game skid by erasing a 13-point, third-quarter deficit and somehow beating the Raptors in Toronto. The incredible effort saw OKC remain in a tie for fifth, except now they share the same record (43-30) with only one team (the Clippers) instead of three. The Raptors, meanwhile, saw their odds of overtaking first-place Milwaukee drop significantly. Toronto trails the Bucks by three full games with just nine remaining. Rockets 111, Spurs 105 Harden\u2019s eruption gave Houston a precious game\u2019s worth of breathing room in third place, just ahead of Portland. The outcome was felt further down the same West standings, where San Antonio fell to eighth place now that they own one more loss than the seventh-place Jazz. Bucks 116, Heat 87 Milwaukee is in the driver\u2019s seat for first place out East, while the Heat\u2019s cushion for eighth is now a razor-thin half-game over Orlando. Nets 111, Lakers 106 Brooklyn now holds a healthy two-game lead over Miami for the seventh spot and is just a half-game back of idle Detroit for sixth place. As for the Lakers\u2026 D\u2019Angelo Russell\u2019s NBA turnaround came full circle on Friday when Brooklyn visited the franchise that made him one of their three consecutive No. 2 overall picks \u2014 and the only one the Lakers decided not to keep. Now fully transformed from Laker outcast to Nets All-Star, Russell took advantage of the ultimate opportunity: the chance to officially eliminate his former team from playoff contention. The 6-foot-3 guard didn\u2019t let the occasion pass him by, putting up 21 points and 13 assists as Brooklyn hammered the final nail into L.A.\u2019s lottery coffin. Speaking of career arcs, none might be stranger than that of JaVale McGee. The 7-foot-1 big man went from absurdly talented first-round pick to a well-paid starter to NBA outcast before curving back to meaningful role player over the last three seasons. Now with the Lakers, the former Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool MVP put up Shaq-like numbers against the Nets: 33 points , 20 rebounds and six blocks. We could include any number of his 15 field goals to illustrate how he dominated inside, but perhaps his shot chart will give you a better idea.  By the end of the night, McGee had become the first Laker to put up a 30-point, 20-rebound, five-block game since\u2026 you guessed it, Shaquille O\u2019Neal. The duo joins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only Lakers ever to record a 30-20-5. If you try and fail to take a charge on Giannis Antetokounmpo, he will let you know about it. March is a defining month for college basketball, and the moments therein live on long after the stars move onto the pros. Dwyane Wade is no exception, and the Heat\u2019s visit to Milwaukee provided the perfect timing and location to remember his electric time at Marquette."},{"id":34809,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/suns-kelly-oubre-thumb-surgery-official-release","date":"2019-03-22","title":"Suns' Oubre out for season after thumb surgery","content":" PHOENIX \u2014 Phoenix Suns forward Kelly Oubre Jr. today underwent a procedure on a sprained left thumb after suffering the injury in the Suns\u2019 game at New Orleans on March 16.

When he proclaimed James Harden as the \u201cbest offensive player I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d it was before the Houston Rockets\u2019 star had won his first Kia MVP, before Harden put the finishing touches on a stellar campaign that saw him lead the Rockets to a franchise-record for wins, the No. 1 overall seed in the playoffs and a Game 7 in the Western Conference finals on their home floor at Toyota Center. A year later, though, and the coach\u2019s words seem more prophetic than controversial. Harden has spent the time between the initial comment and D\u2019Antoni\u2019s confirmation of his original statement living up to every bit of the hype. \u201cNothing\u2019s happened since then to change my mind,\u201d D\u2019Antoni told reporters in Memphis before Harden went nuclear \u2014 his 57 points weren\u2019t enough to rally the Rockets back from a huge deficit \u2014 in a loss to the Grizzlies. Harden\u2019s dizzying and dazzling array of accomplishments this season have been well-documented here since he lifted the Rockets on his shoulders after a rocky start and drove them back into the top four playoff mix in the rugged Western Conference. A night earlier, in a win over Atlanta , Harden cemented his next-level scoring greatness by becoming the first player to score 30 or more points against every other team in the league in a season, joining Michael Jordan (1986-87) on that extremely short list. Just so we\u2019re clear on what Harden is doing for an encore to his MVP-winning season, he became the third player to record multiple 50-point game against the same opponent in a season over the past 30 seasons, joining Jordan, of course, and Kobe Bryant. He also notched his seventh 50-point game of the season, becoming just the sixth player in NBA history to record a 50-point game in five straight months, putting himself on the super short list alongside Wilt Chamberlain. It\u2019s just further proof that D\u2019Antoni, and the legions of folks on the Harden bandwagon, have plenty to crow about where the bearded one is concerned. Haden\u2019s late-season work is also the latest salvo in his journey to what could wind up being a second straight Kia MVP. With just three weeks to go in this regular season, he\u2019s locked into a tight race with Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo for the No. 1 spot in the minds of most. But what is perhaps most important is the mental and emotional space Harden says he\u2019s occupying these days as the Rockets prepare for a a playoff charge to finish what he says they started last season. Harden insists he\u2019s not concerned about more individual hardware or glory, especially with a bigger prize in his sights. \u201cI always have fun hooping,\u201d Harden said earlier this week when I asked him if this is the most fluid his game has ever been and if this is the most fun he\u2019s ever had simply playing the game. \u201cJust with the space I\u2019m in, I\u2019m very, very comfortable and I\u2019m just out here playing free and finding ways to impact the game, putting my stamp on and my footprints on the game. I\u2019m 10 years in now. The only thing I can really do now is enjoy it, have fun with it and just try to take it game for game and be the best that I can be.\u201d The best ever, scoring it at least, D\u2019Antoni has ever seen. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 2 Season stats :  36.1 points, 7.7 assists, 6.5 rebounds, 2.2 steals Harden and the Rockets host the surging Spurs tonight ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) in an important game for playoff positioning for both teams. The Rockets have a chance to chase down the No. 3 seed, if they can finish strong. If Harden keeps playing the way he has, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. He\u2019s been a nightmare for the Spurs, averaging 35.0 points on 52 percent shooting against them this season. The Rockets cannot afford to squander any more of Harden\u2019s monster regular season efforts the way they did Wednesday\u2019s 57-point outing in a loss in Memphis. The one benefit for the Rockets is Harden\u2019s relentless grind. While \u201cload management\u201d is a phrase you hear often this time of year associated with star players headed for the playoffs, it\u2019s simply not a part of Harden\u2019s vocabulary. He doesn\u2019t believe in holding anything back and said the Rockets have too much to play for to ease up now. So expect plenty of fireworks from Harden down the stretch of the season.  Last week:  No. 1 Season stats :  27.5 points, 12.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.3 blocks The injury hits just keep on coming for the Greek Freak and the Bucks. First it was Malcolm Brogdon (foot) , who is out for six to eight weeks. And now Nikola Mirotic (finger) , who could miss weeks, though Mike Budenholzer disputed the reports that he could be out as many as four weeks. If Antetokounmpo hadn\u2019t staked the Bucks to such a roust cushion in the standings, there might be cause for concern in Milwaukee down this final stretch of the season. Instead of panic, there should be a sense of understanding that these bumps and bruises are a part of any NBA season and the reason you operate at a high level from the top of the roster on down is to weather times like this. Antetokounmpo has to worry about making sure his own body is refreshed and recharged for what\u2019s to come. He\u2019s nursing a sprained right ankle of his own that has cost him the Bucks\u2019 past to games. The absence of five rotation players will test any team, even one that has performed at the ridiculously high level the Bucks have all season. Antetokounmpo will have to crank it back up if he wants to finish on top of this list while also making sure the Bucks keep their spot atop the standings. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats :  27.8 points, 5.3 assists, 5.3 rebounds, 1.4 steals The clearest sign that Curry\u2019s operating at that truly galactic level that only he and a select few others in the league can, is that he\u2019s impacting games positively regardless of if he\u2019s having a great shooting night or not. So profound is Curry\u2019s impact on what the Warriors do, he changes the dynamics for both teams just by being on the court and a threat to light it up offensively. Now it certainly helps when he goes off the way he did Tuesday against Minnesota, when he scored 36 points and drained eight of his 14 shots from deep as he and fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson led the way. But he can control the action in other ways to, as he did Thursday night with his 15 points, seven assists and four rebounds in a home win over the Indiana Pacers. Finding the right balance hasn\u2019t been much of an issue for Curry, even with all of the bodies going in and out of Steve Kerr\u2019s playing rotation this season. The fact that Curry doesn\u2019t have to push it every single night bodes well for the Warriors\u2019 long-term prospects as well. They know what is needed from the two-time Kia MVP in the coming weeks and months. Even better is that Curry knows it as well. Last week:  No. 8 Season stats : 27.5 points, 13.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.9 blocks Perhaps Embiid is right. When healthy, he might very well be the most \u201c unstoppable player in the league .\u201d Look at his performance this season when healthy enough to be on the floor. There is no physical match for the Sixers\u2019 big man, who plays all over the floor on both ends at the highest level. The load management break he took out of All-Star Weekend (sore knee) was a much-needed break for a player still trying to put together a full season of action. But the way he\u2019s played since returning has been jaw-dropping. The Sixers have won six straight, including statement wins over Boston and Milwaukee in their last two games. Embiid asserted hid dominance in both contests. He wore the Celtics out Wednesday night with 37 points, 22 rebounds, four assists and a block. He was just as good in Sunday\u2019s win in Milwaukee, going for 40, 15, six and a block . So the next time Embiid shouts about being the most unstoppable player in the game, he might be right. He\u2019s certainly on the right path to living up to all of the hype, self-generated and otherwise. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.2 points 8.2 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 2.2 steals With the Thunder reeling right now, losers of four straight games, George and Russell Westbrook will be the guys who have to provide the solutions. The schedule does them no favors tonight, as they travel to Toronto to take on a Raptors team  (7:30 ET, NBA TV) that has won two straight and remain hot on the trail of the Milwaukee Bucks for the top spot in the Eastern Conference standings. George\u2019s individual game hasn\u2019t been immune to the Thunder\u2019s recent struggles, by the way. He\u2019s shooting just 38.2 percent from the floor in his last 10 games, 32.9 percent from beyond the 3-point line. The concerns folks have had about the Thunder all season are bubbling back up to the surface now just weeks before the playoffs begin. Are they more than just their dynamic duo? And if not, can they really be anything more than a short-timer in the playoffs working solely off of the fuel George and Westbrook provide? A tough road win in Toronto could go a long way in calming down some of these concerns, at least for a day or two. * * * The Next Five 6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 7.

But all that has happened to the Lakers in 2018-19 doesn\u2019t qualify as devastation. No, devastation will be if they have a dreadful summer. Lost in the turmoil of getting swept by the Knicks, LeBron James\u2019 groin pull, Lonzo Ball\u2019s ankle sprain, Brandon Ingram\u2019s blood clot and fallout from the proposed Anthony Davis trade is the forgotten reality that the Lakers were never built to do anything special this season. Challenging for a championship or even reaching the conference finals was never the goal or purpose. This team wasn\u2019t built that way. This was never a \u201cwin-now\u201d project, as much as the noise perhaps led you to believe. This was always a \u201cwin-in-July-2019\u201d project. This season was an embarrassment, nothing less and certainly nothing more. Missing out on the playoffs was unexpected, but not damaging in the big picture. All it did was give talk shows some meaty material, mainly because LeBron was involved and for the first time since 2006 the game\u2019s best player won\u2019t be in prime time this spring or summer. That\u2019s all. But if the Lakers lose big this summer, it could have far-reaching implications for LeBron, the franchise \u2014 and all of it would be bad. There would be justifiable second-guessing, blown opportunities, broken promises, a front office under fire, maybe a strong reaction from owner Jeanie Buss and a fan base in uproar. Most or all of the above will follow the Lakers into next season if they don\u2019t win the offseason. Plenty is riding on president Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka making the right moves to maximize the remaining three years on LeBron\u2019s contract and make the Lakers title contenders. The Lakers do have certain factors in their favor \u2014 ample cap space, the charms of LA, the presence of LeBron and just being a destination franchise \u2014 and so it could work out. There\u2019s also a worst-case scenario that would be nightmarish for all involved should all of the following happen this summer: The primary target in the Get Help For LeBron effort was always Davis, for understandable reasons. He\u2019s a generational talent who\u2019s still in his prime, he has already stated a desire to play for the Lakers and among superstars he\u2019s unassuming and therefore probably the best fit to play in the shadow of LeBron, which can be overwhelming for some. The drawback is Davis, unlike a handful of other A-list players, isn\u2019t a free agent this summer. And while he has some leverage in where he plays next, the Pelicans own his rights for one more season and the ultimate decision rests with them. Evidently, they believe they can get a better package for Davis than the Lakers offered at the trade deadline, perhaps because someone else whispered in their ear (cough \u2026 Celtics, Knicks \u2026 cough). The Pelicans are looking for a haul in order to save face and reshape a losing team and this summer buys them time and a clearer market. The Lakers suffered a blow in the upcoming Davis auction when Ingram suffered his injury, which required surgery. Does that devalue Ingram to a degree in the eyes of New Orleans? Perhaps. And the Lakers don\u2019t have anyone to replace him in any proposal, since Ingram was the centerpiece to any proposal. The odds of them landing at or near the top spot in the June draft isn\u2019t very high, and will be probably be less than 10 percent once the draft order is determined in May. It\u2019s just that with a high pick, the Lakers will own an asset to keep or trade for Davis. If there was ever a team that could use a frozen envelope, it\u2019s the Lakers. Oh, wait: The Knicks are back in the lottery, too. Never mind. This would qualify as a double-whammy. It would cross a free agent off the Lakers\u2019 list and meanwhile they\u2019d watch him go to the crosstown Clippers. What\u2019s more, it would mean Jerry West one-upped his former team. Make that a triple whammy, then. Not only would the Lakers miss out on the top free agent on the market and someone who\u2019s almost guarantee a changing of the guard in the West if not the NBA, KD staying with the Warriors would mean the Golden State dynasty continues. Therefore, even if the Lakers did get Davis (and strip themselves of a supporting cast in the process) they would still trail the Warriors in terms of star power. This would be Durant Lite in terms of impact, but still. He\u2019s probably not a game-changing player and might not be the best fit next to LeBron. Still, while Butler isn\u2019t the most attraction option, he is a good one, and maybe a necessary one if the Lakers strike out in other places. Butler would be better than nothing. Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to envision Irving reattaching himself to LeBron when he escaped LeBron three summers ago (and still hasn\u2019t given a coherent reason for doing so). And that\u2019s it. Should the Lakers whiff on three or more of these players, times will get tense in L.A.. Yes, there are solid free agents such as Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, DeMarcus Cousins and others available this summer, and Mike Conley could be available in a trade. Yet they qualify as fallback Plan B players, not gotta-have players. Remember, the Lakers and Magic gambled heavily just to put themselves in position to seize the summer of 2019. They traded D\u2019Angelo Russell to the Brooklyn Nets because the Nets also agreed to take Timofey Mozgov\u2019s massive contract (in addition to sending a No. 1 pick to LA which became Kyle Kuzma). They didn\u2019t re-sign Julius Randle, their former lottery pick from two years ago. They also bailed on Lou Williams and traded promising young center Ivica Zubac, all because they didn\u2019t want to commit to any long-term money beyond 2018. Well: Randle, Russell and Williams are having career years and Zubac might be a starter next season. Not to mention, Brook Lopez is succeeding on the best team in the East. Suppose the Lakers did all that \u2026 and didn\u2019t maximize the cap flexibility that came in return? It will have all been a waste, and a costly one at that. Should the Lakers endure a summer to dismember, then they\u2019ll be forced to scramble to pad the roster, pray that LeBron\u2019s body won\u2019t fail him again as he turns 35 and hope Ball, Ingram and Kuzma produce breakout seasons. That\u2019s a lot of positive projections. It would be a best-case scenario on the heels of a worst-case scenario. If you think the Lakers are catching hell now, well, a poor summer would mean there\u2019d be hell to pay. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

And we\u2019ve got upsets and changes to the bracket , too! There\u2019s only two Thursdays left in the regular season, so let\u2019s cut to the (postseason) chase. Here are six updates to the standings following a six-game night. Jazz\u2019s streak ends  Was this equivalent to Murray State\u2019s upset of Marquette? The Jazz flew into Atlanta riding a five-game win streak, a stretch that propelled them to fifth in the Western Conference standings. The lottery-bound Hawks, however, stunned Utah with a 117-115 victory that sent Donovan Mitchell and company back to the West\u2019s seventh slot. Trae Young recorded 23 points and 11 assists, outscoring everyone in the fourth quarter and hitting the go-ahead three-point play. Mitchell poured in a game-high 34 points and nearly drilled a last-second 3-pointer that could\u2019ve sent the game to overtime. It was a tough setback for the Jazz, who held the fifth spot for all of 24 hours. But sudden shifts are expected in the cutthroat West standings at this point. The good news for the Jazz: Of the four teams tied with a 42-30 record in the West, Utah has the easiest schedule remaining. Karl-Anthony Towns has passed Kevin Love for fourth on the Timberwolves\u2019 all-time scoring list. Love spent six seasons with Minnesota, while the 23-year-old Towns is still in year four. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Timberwolves\/status\/1108889327319371776%20 Towns now trails Sam Mitchell, Andrew Wiggins and Kevin Garnett.

The two-time All-Star has been on a tear this past month , averaging 31.3 points (second in NBA) and 14 rebounds (third in NBA) since Feb. 25. Remember when Trae Young completely lost his defender with a nifty behind-the-back dribble for possibly the most viral play of his rookie season? If not, here\u2019s a refresher: Troy Brown is still spinning. Young brought the move back out against the Jazz, and while no one went in circles this time, both defenders were thrown for a loop by these sick handles.  Swipa steals, Swipa slams.

Former lottery pick Jimmer Fredette has reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with the Phoenix Suns, bringing the former BYU standout back to the NBA after a four-season absence. Shams Charania of The Athletic \u2014 who first broke the news \u2014 reports Fredette and the Suns have agreed to a two-year deal, the second year of which is a team option. News of the deal was also reported by ESPN.com and 98.7 FM Arizona Sports. While that addition seems imminent for the Suns, they will also reportedly be without a player for the rest of this season. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports forward Kelly Oubre Jr. will have a minor procedure on his left thumb and miss the rest of 2018-19 . Oubre is expected to miss four to six weeks, but should make a full recovery. He is a restricted free agent this summer and has averaged 20 points and 5.7 rebounds per game since becoming a starter after the All-Star break. The Suns picked up Oubre in a trade with the Washington Wizards in December. Overall, Oubre is averaging 15.2 ppg this season \u2014 a career-best \u2014 and, per Wojnarowski, is expected to be a priority for the Suns this summer in free agency. Fredette has spent the past three seasons playing for Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association. This season in the CBA, Fredette is averaging 36 points per game on 47.6 percent shooting (41.9 percent on 3-pointers), 5.6 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. Phoenix\u2019s decision to add Fredette gives it another prospect to evaluate as the season draws near its end. The Suns are 17-55 and the worst team in the Western Conference, having missed the playoffs for a ninth straight season. The last time Fredette played in the NBA was in the 2015-16 season, when he logged six total games as a member of the New Orleans Pelicans (four games) and New York Knicks (two games). He was called up by the Pelicans in November 2015 when he was a member of the NBA G League\u2019s Westchester Knicks. He was then called by the New York Knicks on Feb. 22, 2016, but returned to the G League on March 6, 2016. Fredette was taken in the 2017 G League Expansion Draft by the Memphis Hustle , but he opted to sign with a CBA team instead. The 10th overall pick by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2010 Draft, Fredette has appeared in 235 career NBA games with the Sacramento Kings (2011-14), Chicago Bulls (2013-14), Pelicans and Knicks. In his NBA career, Fredette has averaged 6 ppg, 1 rpg and 1.4 apg while shooting 41.2 percent overall and 38.1 percent on 3-pointers."},{"id":34853,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wolves-rose-covington-teague-likely-done-season","date":"2019-03-21","title":"Wolves' Rose, Teague, Covington expected to miss rest of season","content":" The Minnesota Timberwolves are not officially out of the playoff chase, but to reach that difficult goal, they\u2019ll have to do so with a decidedly shorthanded roster. The team announced today that forward Robert Covington and guards Derrick Rose and Jeff Teague are all expected to miss the rest of the season due to injury. Rose and Teague had missed the last four games with injury, with Rose suffering with soreness and swelling in his right elbow while Teague had re-aggravated a left foot injury originally suffered in December. An MRI of Rose\u2019s elbow revealed a chip fracture and a loose body in the elbow. He and the team are exploring further treatment options. As for Teague, he received an injection on Tuesday to treat inflammation. He will now wear a boot and will be reevaluated in three weeks. Covington has missed the last 34 games for Minnesota because of a right knee bone bruise \u2014 an injury he originally suffered on Dec. 31. He had been progressing well of late and was taking part in on-court activities, but had a recent setback that will require further treatment.

The Wolves are No. 10 in the West, 9 1\/2 games behind the No. 8-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder. Seven of their remaining 11 games are against teams with a .500 or better record.

Forward Nikola Mirotic has been diagnosed with a sprained left thumb and fracture, the team announced today . Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Mirotic will miss the next two to four weeks with the injury. Mirotic, who was acquired by Milwaukee via New Orleans at the trade deadline, has been a valuable 3-point shooting threat for the Bucks since he landed there. However, Mirotic was slowed earlier this season by a calf injury when he was playing for the Pelicans. If Mirotic misses the full four weeks, he would likely not return to Milwaukee\u2019s lineup until sometime during the playoffs. The postseason begins on April 13 and, depending on how the Bucks\u2019 first-round series shakes out, Mirotic would theoretically be returning for the end of the first round or the start of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Mirotic\u2019s injury makes him the second significant player in the Bucks\u2019 rotation to go down with an injury lately. Guard Malcolm Brogdon was ruled out indefinitely last week with a plantar fascia tear in his right foot. Most estimates have Brogdon returning to the lineup in the next six to eight weeks. In 14 games with the Bucks this season, Mirotic is averaging 11.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists while making 35.6 percent of his 3-poiners. In 64 games this season, Brogdon is averaging a career-high 15.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 28.6 minutes per game, while shooting career bests in field goal percentage (.505) and 3-point percentage (.426). Mirotic had recently replaced Brogdon in the starting lineup, filling that role in Milwaukee\u2019s last two games. DJ Wilson, who had played well this season but lost playing time after Mirotic and Pau Gasol were added, should see an uptick in minutes now that Mirotic will be out. The Bucks are 53-18 and have been the best team in the Eastern Conference all season. Milwaukee has a three-game lead over the Toronto Raptors for the No. 1 seed and has 10 games left to play this season. Six of those remaining games are against teams with a .500 record or better."},{"id":34884,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-3-20-19","date":"2019-03-21","title":"About Last Night: Embiid 'unstoppable' in Sixers' statement victory","content":"With an 11-point lead at halftime, the Boston Celtics appeared to be on their way to a season-series sweep of the Philadelphia 76ers. The turning point came 54 seconds into third quarter when tempers flared. Marcus Smart took exception to Joel Embiid sticking out his left elbow on a hard pick that knocked Smart to the court. With Embiid\u2019s back turned, Smart gave Embiid a two-handed shove that sent him sprawling toward the sideline. Embiid got up and had to be separated from Smart. After reviewing the play, the referees gave Smart a Flagrant 2 foul, which comes with an automatic ejection. Embiid received a technical foul. Embiid scored the next eight points to help Philadelphia pull within four. \u201cStuff like that gets me going, gets the crowd going,\u201d Embiid told reporters after the game. \u201cObviously, I was frustrated because it was a cheap shot. I didn\u2019t see it coming.\u201d Embiid finished with 37 points and a career-high 22 rebounds, leading the Sixers to their sixth straight victory, 118-115 . Philadelphia moved four games ahead of Boston in the standings and improved to 7-1 in games in which they\u2019ve had all the pieces of their new starting lineup together. Assuming the Sixers finish with the No. 3 seed and the Celtics end up at No. 4 or 5, the two rivals could meet in the Eastern Conference finals. In a span of three weeks, the Oklahoma City Thunder have fallen from the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference into a three-way tie for the No. 6 seed. That\u2019s what happens when you lose 10 of 15 games coming out of the All-Star break. In the first game of a home-and-home series with the Toronto Raptors, the Thunder rallied from a 20-point deficit in the second half only to fall in overtime, 123-114 . OKC will look to end their current four-game slide Friday night in Toronto. Here\u2019s a look at the playoff matchups if the season ended today.  Oklahoma City retired Nick Collison\u2019s No. 4 jersey in a pregame ceremony, the first time the franchise has so honored a player since its move to Oklahoma City in 2008. The Seattle SuperSonics drafted Collison out of Kansas in 2003 and he spent his entire 15-year career with the club. \u201cI could never have expected something like this,\u201d Collison said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a special night for me and my family. It\u2019s been a long run. To be able to have the career I had here and then have a celebration like that, I feel very fortunate.\u201d Among his former Thunder teammates who attended the ceremony were Kevin Durant of Golden State and Serge Ibaka of the Raptors. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle, but he still made some NBA history when his younger brother, Kostas, made his NBA debut for the Dallas Mavericks. The Antetokounmpo brothers became the seventh set of three brothers to play in the NBA.  Thanasis Antetokounmpo, currently playing in the EuroLeague, appeared in two games for the New York Knicks during the 2015-16 season. Kostas checked in with 5:53 left in the fourth quarter and had one point, one rebound and two steals. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling, man,\u201d Kostas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true and I was excited I was able to score a point.\u201d With 33 seconds left, he made one of two free throws. Spurs give Wade special gifts  Dwayne Wade\u2019s farewell tour stopped in San Antonio, and the Spurs didn\u2019t wait until after the game for the customary jersey swap. Following a pregame video tribute , Gregg Popovich walked over to greet Wade and presented him with a gift box that included signed jerseys of Spurs legends Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. Turns out Wade had a memorable parting shot of his own for San Antonio, drilling a 3-pointer from just beyond half court at the end of the third quarter. Wade finished with 11 points and two rebounds in 20 minutes, as the Heat snapped the Spurs\u2019 nine-game winning streak with a 110-105 victory . James Harden scored 57 points (in a loss to the Grizzlies) \u2014 his seventh 50-point game of the season.

Milwaukee superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle on Wednesday night, one of several key injuries to hit the Eastern Conference-leading Bucks in recent days. A leading MVP contender, Antetokounmpo will rest against the Cavaliers as the Bucks, who enter with the NBA\u2019s best record, try to clinch their first Central Division title since 2001. Antetokounmpo also sat Tuesday night when the Bucks beat the Los Angeles Lakers, who played without LeBron James and deprived fans of a matchup of two of the game\u2019s biggest names. \u201cHe\u2019s making progress,\u201d coach Mike Budenholzer said of Antetokounmpo. \u201cHe just can\u2019t go tonight. It\u2019s us hopefully being smart and being somewhat cautious, but it\u2019s more than that. He can\u2019t play.

Antetokounmpo is averaging 27.5 points, 12.7 rebounds and 6.0 assists, and his mere presence on the floor makes the Bucks a more dangerous team. In the past few days, the Bucks have been rocked by injuries to starting guard Malcolm Brogdon (plantar fascia tear) and forward Nikola Mirotic (sprained thumb). Milwaukee were also without backup center Pau Gasol (ankle), guard Sterling Brown (wrist), guard Donte DiVincenzo (heel) and guard George Hill (groin). Brogdon is out indefinitely while the Bucks did not provide a timeline on Mirotic\u2019s return. \u201cThese things can always change,\u201d Budenholzer said, downplaying a report Mirotic could miss one month \u201cIn a perfect world they\u2019re less. Sometimes they take longer. This is a little bit of a unique injury.

He\u2019s averaging 11.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 22.9 minutes. The wave of injuries will test Milwaukee\u2019s depth just as the team builds for the playoffs. \u201cCertainly there\u2019s no good time to have them, but we feel good about our depth,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cAs long as guys can return in a timely way, which we\u2019re hopeful of, getting some time without games, not pounding on your body, may be a silver lining.\u201d"},{"id":34850,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-dangelo-russell-la-clippers-rookie-class","date":"2019-03-20","title":"Hang Time Podcast: D'Angelo Russell, Clippers' surprising season + 2019 Rookie Class","content":"NBA.com writer Shaun Powell joins John Schuhmann and me to discuss the wild win by D\u2019Angelo Russell and the Nets on Tuesday night.

Shaun Powell :  The first is Lou Williams in a year where he broke the all-time bench scoring record and helped rescue the Clippers after the Tobias Harris trade. The second is his teammate, Montrezl Harrell , also in the running for Kia NBA Most Improved honors, emerging as a top energy guy. The third is Derrick Rose , who resurrected his career by finding a useful role that has him shooting more efficiently. John Schuhmann :  Lou Williams leads the league in both points (1,339) and assists (349) off the bench, while also ranking third in total plus-minus (plus-220) off the bench. He\u2019s not the most efficient scorer among the league\u2019s super-high usage players , but his ability to get to the line gives him a true shooting percentage (55.5 percent) just slightly below the league average (55.9 percent). Domantas Sabonis hasn\u2019t been the headliner that Williams has been. But he also deserves some real consideration for the top spot, given how efficiently he\u2019s scored (much more efficiently than Williams), how well he has rebounded ( he ranks in the top 10 in rebounding percentage ) and how good the Pacers have been with him on the floor, especially on defense (where Williams is a liability). And yes, defense matters! Montrezl Harrell is a notch below Sabonis across the board (efficiency, rebounding, passing and defense), but is worthy of a top-three spot. Apologies, as always, to Andre Iguodala (who makes the Golden State Warriors better when he enters the game) and the Spurs\u2019 bench ensemble (which has been terrific once again). Sekou Smith :  Lou Williams at No. 1. Lou Williams at No. 2 and No. 3  as well . Seriously, is there anyone else who can even come close to the Clippers\u2019 closer and the league\u2019s all-time best bench scorer ? Derrick Rose and Domantas Sabonis would scrap it out for those two spots after Williams , who gets extra credit for being the Clippers\u2019 closer all season. But I\u2019m convinced this is the one award this season where someone can go ahead and start engraving Lou\u2019s name on the trophy."},{"id":34862,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-first-round-upset-2019","date":"2019-03-20","title":"Blogtable: Which team is poised to pull off a first-round upset?","content":" * * * Which team has the best chance to pull off a first-round upset?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  I know, I know, it\u2019s tempting to look West to the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz or LA Clippers for this. After all, the untested Denver Nuggets \u2014 postseason-wise, anyway \u2014 will be facing an opponent that finishes well above .500. But I\u2019m wondering if Miami might be an even better underdog pick against Milwaukee if they meet in the East\u2019s No. 1-vs-No. 8 slot . The Heat are a tough out in my opinion based on their pace and their defense, especially opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage (No. 2 in the NBA). The Bucks are coping with some injuries now, with Malcolm Brogdon possible to miss the first round and Nikola Mirotic hurting a hand Tuesday vs. the Lakers. If Giannis Antetokounmpo has to handle too much of the heavy lifting and his perimeter shooters clang through a game or two, Milwaukee \u2013 which has gotten out of the first round just once in 30 years \u2013 might see its marvelous season end prematurely. You don\u2019t think Dwyane Wade, Marquette\u2019s best-ever pro, would like to stir the echoes in Milwaukee before he\u2019s done? Shaun Powell :  We haven\u2019t often seen the words \u201cSan Antonio Spurs\u201d and \u201cupset candidate\u201d in the same sentence for over two decades, but this year may qualify. They\u2019ll probably finish high enough in the standings to avoid the Golden State Warriors and perhaps get the Denver Nuggets or Houston Rockets, either of whom would be a more realistic upset target. I wouldn\u2019t put it past a team that can slow the pace behind two All-Stars and an all-time great coach pulling off the unexpected. John Schuhmann :  A tough schedule going forward may keep the Thunder in the bottom half of the West playoff picture. But through Tuesday, Oklahoma City has the best record (14-10) and is tied with Golden State for the most road wins (six) in games played between the eight West playoff teams. It would be tough to pick the Spurs , because they\u2019ve been so terrible on the road, where they\u2019re 1-9 (having allowed more than 120 points per 100 possessions) against the other seven playoff teams, with the only win having come against the eighth-place Clippers. Of course, with a relatively easy remaining schedule, the Spurs could move up to fourth and have home-court advantage in a No. 4-vs.-No. 5 matchup. Really, seven of the eight playoff teams (all except the Warriors) could lose in the first round and six of them (all except the Clippers and Spurs) could reach the conference finals.  Sekou Smith :  Based on where they sit today, the Utah Jazz are a team that would cause a higher seed some sleepless playoff nights. They have some of my must-have components for a playoff-upset candidate: sturdy defense, a game-changing player on both ends (Rudy Gobert on defense, Donovan Mitchell on offense), a gunslinger capable of a wicked playoff run or two (Joe Ingles) and some quality postseason experience ( gained in the 2018 run ). The Jazz would be an intriguing matchup against the Nuggets, who still need to prove themselves in the playoffs. A tight series early would add pressure for both sides, but especially for Denver, which flirted with the West\u2019s No. 1 seed at times in 2018-19. This is supposed to be about the team that could spring the upset, and the Jazz fit the bill for me."},{"id":34881,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-case-against-celtics-finals","date":"2019-03-20","title":"Blogtable: Your case for (and against) why Celtics could make The Finals?","content":" * * * Your case for and against the Boston Celtics going all the way to The Finals?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Since I picked Boston at the start of the season to reach The Finals, I don\u2019t have to labor to cite reasons why it still might happen: talent, experience and coaching. The Celtics still have the deepest roster among the East contenders, in my opinion. They reached Game 7 of the 2018 Eastern Conference finals. And I think Brad Stevens and staff locking into one opponent for four to seven games is a legit competitive advantage. However, since I\u2019ve seen Boston often since the start of the season, I can see things going awry. Essentially adding Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving (absent from playoffs) hasn\u2019t sparked a big leap. In fact, there is a chemistry problem on that team and they\u2019re not as good defensively this season. Playing out of the No. 4 or 5 hole means they face a bumpy road through the first three rounds against rivals who\u2019ve gotten nastier. Shaun Powell :  Here\u2019s the case for the Celtics: They were a game away from going last year without Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. They also might have the best eight-man unit in the East. Kyrie Irving is a proven big-shot maker and Brad Stevens will not get outcoached. The case against Boston: This season\u2019s been too inconsistent and the trend could reappear and spook them. Hayward still hasn\u2019t returned to form, Al Horford is slipping and they don\u2019t have a bonafide defensive answer for Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard or Giannis Antetokounmpo. John Schuhmann :  The case for is strong. The Celtics have a talented, versatile and experienced nine-man rotation that can match up with any team. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid are the two best players in the Eastern Conference, and Al Horford outplayed them both in the 2018 playoffs. The Celtics have had a top-five defense and the top-ranked clutch offense (having scored an incredible 130 points per 100 possessions with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime). Kyrie Irving is one of the league\u2019s best late-game bucket-getters. The case against starts with the competition, because there are three other teams in the East that are capable of getting to The Finals. The Celtics have owned the Sixers over the last two seasons, but if Boston remains in the No. 4 vs. 5 matchup, they would have a tough first-round series against the Indiana Pacers and(if they got through that) then face the Bucks. Milwaukee has been the best team in the East from Day 1, it ranks in the top three in both offensive and defensive efficiency, and is 9-4 against the other teams in the East\u2019s top five. The Celtics themselves can be too dependent on jump shots. They rank 29th in free throw rate and 27th in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area. They were held under a point per possession in losses in Milwaukee and Toronto right after the All-Star break. And speaking of playing in Milwaukee and Toronto, the Celtics will probably be starting the conference semifinals and conference finals (if they get there) on the road, where they were 1-7 in last year\u2019s playoffs . The one road win come because Marco Belinelli\u2019s shoes were a half size too big. Sekou Smith :  The easy answer on both counts would be Kyrie Irving. He\u2019s the key to the Celtics\u2019 championship hopes this season (no matter what anyone says) and he\u2019s playing at a high level at the right time for a team drafting its way toward the postseason. But if he can\u2019t take it to that next level as the No. 1 guy for the entire playoffs \u2014 something we have never seen him do \u2014 folks won\u2019t have to look far for a scapegoat for what doomed the Celtics\u2019 season. It\u2019s a ton of responsibility to put on one player, of course. But isn\u2019t this the load he wanted when he requested his trade from Cleveland? He wanted to be the catalyst for a team poised to do exactly what the Celtics hope to be the cusp of accomplishing."},{"id":34880,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-3-19-19","date":"2019-03-20","title":"About Last Night: An improbable comeback's unlikely hero","content":" Of course it was Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. On a night when the comeback was the story, when D\u2019Angelo Russell\u2019s career-high 44 points made everything happen, when Jared Dudley hit the three that finally gave the Brooklyn Nets the lead after a franchise-best 25-point fourth-quarter climb, it was the longest-tenured member of the team who hit the game winner. Acquired on Draft day 2015, Billy King\u2019s final remnant \u2013 all-3-and-D but buried in the rotation \u2013 on this night, Hollis-Jefferson got to play hero. The Nets, who had trailed the Sacramento Kings by as many as 28 points on Tuesday, completed the fourth-largest fourth-quarter comeback since the advent of the shot clock. The 123-121 victory snapped a three-game slide, and kept Brooklyn solidly in the Eastern Conference\u2019s seventh slot. That final play, of course, wasn\u2019t drawn up for him. It was for Russell. He of the 27 fourth-quarter points , the rainbow 3s and the ice-cold veins. Hollis-Jefferson screened De\u2019Aaron Fox, then stepped toward the sideline to collect the inbounds with Marvin Bagley III defending. He took one open dribble toward the top of the key, looking to handoff to Russell and set up a full-speed charge down the lane. Russell quickly realized Fox was cutting off his path to the ball and \u2026 ceded the spotlight with a simple command and a backwards step, pulling Fox clear of the path. \u201c[Russell] said, \u2018Go!'\u201d Hollis-Jefferson told YES Network\u2019s Michael Grady immediately after the whistle. \u201cI looked at Bagley and said, \u2018It\u2019s gametime, let\u2019s get it.\u2019 \u201d Hollis-Jefferson crossed left-to-right, then back left for one head-down stumble-bumble alongside Bagley. Here, Hollis-Jefferson sensed Bagley\u2019s presence and twisted ever-so-slightly as he leapt, an outside spin making the final attempt appear to pop out over his head before softly banking and rolling in off the rim. Staggered reactions ensued on the Nets bench, and one errant heave later, bedlam. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy on our team that\u2019s heart and soul, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Russell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain it. He came out ready to play. Didn\u2019t play the whole first half, but came out and took care of business.\u201d On this upstart Nets team, the one that finally turned the culture corner in Year Three under coach Kenny Atkinson and GM Sean Marks, Hollis-Jefferson counts as seasoned. He is 25. Six Nets are younger. None exceed his four seasons in Brooklyn. Many exceed his minutes. Hollis-Jefferson played 17 of them Tuesday; he had received but 12 minutes in the five games prior, with several \u201cDNP \u2013 Coach\u2019s Decision\u201d lines sprinkled about. He credited assistant coach Jacque Vaughn with helping him to maintain a positive outlook and stay prepared. \u201cNot playing \u2026 man, it\u2019s tough sitting on that bench watching your guys go to war,\u201d Hollis-Jefferson said. \u201cBut I was always ready. They called my name, I came out and competed and that\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d That and an obligatory dousing, anyway. Cheers. No surprise in the Rockets beating the Hawks, or James Harden (again) scoring 30-plus. But in the wild ridiculous statistical accomplishments department, that marked the 29th opppoent Harden had dropped 30 on this season. Yes, 29 of 29 teams caught a 30-piece this season (and several many more). Per Elias, he\u2019s the first player to make the 29-team circuit and the first to tag everyone since Michael Jordan\u2019s ridiculous 1986-87 campaign. Also, he put Kent Bazemore in the blender. So there\u2019s that. It was a night during which most contenders solidified positions rather than swapped them. Indiana missed their chance to clinch a postseason appearance, dropping a 115-109 decision to the Clippers. Here\u2019s the full Playoff Picture , as it stands after Tuesday\u2019s action: On a day the Sixers smoothly turned away a feisty challenge from the Hornets, J.J. Redick knocked a longstanding check off the NBA bucket list. More than 12 years and 800 games into his NBA career, Redick (27 points, career-high 10 rebounds, eight assists) finally notched a double-double. At 826 games, it\u2019s the third-longest streak without one all-time, trailing only Steve Kerr (856) and Bruce Bowen (none in all 873 career games). \u201cTen rebounds,\u201d Redick said during the postgame interview on court. \u201cI never thought the day would come.\u201d Stephen Curry might have stolen the show in Minnesota with a 22-point third-quarter , but Karl-Anthony Towns threw down the dunk that we\u2019ll remember from this one. Kevin Durant 100 percent had a \u201cYes, yes, nope!\u201d moment in the thought process there. Bailing out was the right call, ha. There was a unique wedgie in the second quarter of the Bucks-Lakers game, with the ball lodging above the shot clock. The refs paged the nearest friendly giant \u2014 true 7-footer Brook Lopez \u2014 for an assist, which he gladly provided once handed a mop, much to the crowd\u2019s delight. Sidebar: I worked at the Nets from 2008-13, so Brook and I were \u201crookies\u201d the same season and two of the only everyday faces for the next 5 1\/2 years. When I told him I was heading off to MSG for the Knicks gig, he bent all the way over to dap me up, which was simultaneously dope and humbling, because it was very touching and also I am a full-sized human.

Nowitzki scored the decisive points on a trademark fadeaway jumper . After the historic field goal, the Mavericks played a tribute video during the next stoppage in play, and Nowitzki was applauded by the crowd at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Nowitzki trails No. 5 Michael Jordan by more than 800 points. LeBron James (32,439) is the only other active player in the top five.

Chamberlain once averaged more than 50 points in a season, dominating inside to such a degree that the NBA widened the paint in an effort to neutralize him. Nowitzki, meanwhile, has made nearly 2,000 3-pointers in his prolific career, establishing the trend of big men with long-range shooting capabilities.

Thomas\u2019 postseason was done just seven games after that, sidelined by a lingering hip injury that would not only end his tenure with the Celtics but diminish his career to such a degree that he\u2019s on his third team since. That team is the Denver Nuggets, who needed just nine games after Thomas returned from yet another lengthy inactive spell to determine that he\u2019s not fit for a spot in their regular rotation. They\u2019re currently battling the Golden State Warriors for the Western Conference\u2019s top seed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I enjoyed doing,\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone told reporters Monday of his recent meeting with Thomas, when he told the player his minutes would be dramatically reduced. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t take it well, and he didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d Thomas averaged 8.6 points on 37.3-percent shooting in his de facto tryout, a far cry from his 2016-17 average of 28.9 ppg on 46.3 percent shooting. Thomas returned to the scene of that peak on Monday as the Nuggets traveled to Boston, where Thomas earned an affectionate ovation before the game, another shortly after it tipped off with a tribute video that brought Celtics fans to their feet, and then one more when checked in late in the first quarter \u2014 sporting green kicks, naturally. Thomas later explained the shoes had been custom-made for a potential Celtics appearance in The Finals. \u201cThis city is one of a kind,\u201d Thomas told reporters before last night\u2019s game. \u201cAll I did was give 100 percent every time out, and they fell in love with that. That love is genuine. There\u2019s nothing fake about it. I just embrace it, because these type of things can be taken away from you at any moment.\u201d Nobody knows that hard truth better than Thomas. Unwilling to shell out a big extension for the injured Thomas with free agency looming, the Celtics shipped him off to Cleveland in August 2017 as part of a package to land perennial All-Star Kyrie Irving. Roughly five months later the Cavaliers traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers , who then let him walk to the Nuggets via free agency last summer . His combined 2017-18 production: 15.2 ppg, 37.3 percent shooting and a middling 12.6 Player Efficiency Rating. Thomas sat for the first 56 games of this season, hoping to let his battered body heal once and for all. But it made little difference as the high-powered Nuggets saw no need to force feed him minutes with Monte Morris solidifying the backup point guard role on a deep roster battling for their best record in more than 40 years.

The bit about the Spurs playing well? No question. Monday\u2019s victory marked their ninth straight, easily the best stretch in what had been a decidedly un- Spurs-y season marked by mediocre defense and inconsistency. (More on that in a bit.) But the Warriors as No. 1 in the West? Not anymore, with their loss and the Denver Nuggets\u2019 114-105 victory over the Boston Celtics deadlocking them atop the standings at 47-22. OK, so the Warriors are technically still in first place thanks to their 2-1 series lead over the Nuggets. (The two teams play one final time in Denver on April 2.) That it\u2019s even that close this late in the season feels substantial given Golden State\u2019s awesome firepower, with the offseason addition of DeMarcus Cousins seemingly sealing a third straight title before the 2018-19 campaign tipped. And while the playoffs are entirely different beast, the Warriors will have to run the table just to hit the 60-win mark that had been a foregone conclusion. Or so we thought. Full credit to the high-powered Nuggets for making it this interesting, and looking good while doing it. Riding another superlative performance from All-Star center Nikola Jokic (21 points, 13 rebounds, 7 assists), they slugged the Celtics with a 16-2 run spanning the third and fourth quarters and mostly cruised from there. The Warriors, meanwhile, made multiple runs in San Antonio but, with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant shooting a combined 10 for 31 on 3-pointers, could never get completely over the hump. (It would have been even worse had Curry not banked in a 61-footer to end the first quarter, the fourth 50-plus foot shot of his career.) Much of that had to do with a Spurs team that, after struggling for most of the season, has suddenly rediscovered the defensive prowess that has been a hallmark of their success under coach Gregg Popovich. One possession in particular stood out against the Warriors, as the Spurs rotated around like banshees while defending a late four-point lead. That led to the ideal outcome against a team featuring three of the NBA\u2019s best marksmen: An open 3 for 26-percent shooter Draymond Green, which he predictably missed, followed by a made 3 by Davis Bertans that put the Spurs up by seven with less than two minutes left. Combined with Oklahoma City\u2019s swoon (9 losses in 13 games), the Spurs suddenly find themselves just 1.5 games behind the Portland Trail Blazers for fourth in the West. That means, after flirting with actually missing the playoffs for the first time in two decades, they\u2019re in range of holding home-court advantage in the first round. With the third-place Rockets also rounding into form with 11 victories in their past 12, the West is suddenly looking a lot more competitive than it had been even a few weeks ago. That might not ultimately deter the Warriors, who are still massive favorites in Vegas to win it all. But if the Nuggets, or the Spurs, or the Rockets have their say, Green\u2019s recent declaration to The Athletic that another championship is \u201cjust that simple\u201d might not actually be. You get points for the effort, Moe. But that\u2019s about it. Another monster milestone for Dirk Nowitzki, who passed Wilt Chamberlain for sixth on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list. It took a year, but Isaiah Thomas finally got the tribute video in Boston he so richly deserved. Wilt, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook \u2026 and Elfrid Payton? Yup, the journeyman point guard is now associated with four of the greatest to ever lace \u2019em up thanks to his fifth straight triple-double, achieved in the Pelicans\u2019 129-125 OT victory over the Mavericks.

John, after all, had a head start of nine years in the league, though he\u2019s only a couple years older. Jacyn had been doing fine as an officer with the Miami-Dade police department when big brother pitched him on the idea. And John? Well, he can blame the long hours, low pay and limited opportunities he found in his first career choice as an aspiring high school or college athletic director. That\u2019s what sent him back to officiating, turning a moonlighting gig into a career now in its 12th season. They\u2019re the first siblings to work on the NBA\u2019s referee staff, which gives them even more to talk and argue about as each other\u2019s best friend. They\u2019re as close as ever, living and raising families in their native South Florida while working in officiating orbits that so far have yet to intersect; the brothers still were waiting for the night they\u2019re assigned to the same game. When they spoke recently via a group FaceTime chat with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner, John had just gotten home from Washington, D.C., where he worked the Magic-Wizards game the night before. Jacyn was getting ready to head out again, his turnaround at home almost over after working Portland\u2019s game in Los Angeles two nights earlier.  * * * Steve Aschburner:  You guys have families, with four kids ranging in age from 10 to 14 years old. What are these quick pit stops in Miami like, given how much time you\u2019re away from home? John Goble:  If time permits and the schedule aligns with the stars and the solar and lunar eclipses, then we might have time to make events. But we do miss a lot. Like Wednesday, when my son turns 15, I\u2019ll be out of town. We\u2019re going to celebrate it the following weekend when everybody\u2019s home. Jacyn Goble:  I do the same thing. Sometimes I try to take \u2018em on a trip. If it\u2019s a one-day turnaround it works. Or at the end of the [calendar] year, Dec. 30 I had the Lakers and Clippers with a day off in between. So I took the family out and spent time together then. SA:  How did this end up as the family business? My understanding is that, John, you pitched Jacyn on becoming a referee, at least on a part-time basis. John Goble:  Yeah, for the most part. Early on, just getting into officiating, it was something I was doing while in college. Then my brother graduated [from high school] and I mentioned to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a great part-time job.\u201d I think that\u2019s how most people get into it, whether it\u2019s baseball or basketball. It\u2019s a good way to stay connected with a sport if you played it, and you can make some extra money to make ends meet. I did only basketball to pay for books and tuition and then start creating my financial independence.  SA:  Jacyn, when you got into it, was that the ceiling you had on it, that it was going to be a moonlighting thing? Jacyn Goble:  Yes, absolutely. Part-time job. Make ends meet. Same thing. SA:  Like John, you ended up at the height of your profession. But it came later for you, right? Jacyn Gobel:  After I did it for a couple of years, I joined the Miami-Dade police force. So I broke away for about six years before my brother got me back into refereeing again. SA:  Working as a police officer, was that a dream of yours? It definitely isn\u2019t the kind of job someone takes lightly like any old 9-to-5 job.  Jacyn Goble:  Growing up, we played in a police athletic league, and they used to host the games at a gym the police department used as a training facility. That sparked my interest. Once I graduated from high school, I thought I\u2019d really like to be a cop. So I applied and got hired, and I had to stop refereeing for several years. SA:  And John, you never got bit by that bug? John Goble:  No interest whatsoever. SA:  In fact, you got your degree in physical education and sports management. So you had another line of work in mind entirely. John Gobel:  Yes. It came to a head my senior year at FIU [Florida International University]. My ultimate goal was to stay involved in athletics by trying to become an athletic director. When I got done with my degree and after doing an internship, I saw that the opportunities were very limited in trying to break into that field. Especially for the amount of money they were making. Concurrently I had started to advance in college officiating. Officiating was fun, and I wanted to see how high I could get on the college side \u2013 I really had no interest in the NBA. The summer I graduated from FIU, I received a letter from the NBA about attending their summer league. When I went there \u2013 it was in Boston in 2001 \u2013 and refereed those games, that really piqued my interest. I liked the style of play, the pace. I said, \u201cIf I ever have an opportunity\u2026\u201d That\u2019s the first time I thought about being in the NBA as a career. I decided to give it my all to see if I could make it. If not, I still had my sports management degree and I could referee college basketball. SA:  Did it suit you right off as you worked through the NCAA conferences and then the G League? John Gobel:  I would say for the most part. For anybody who\u2019s competitive, there\u2019s a maturation process when you get into officiating. As you get a little bit older, when there are certain responses from players and coaches and fans, you realize 90 percent of the time they\u2019re yelling at the shirt. You could walk by them without a referee\u2019s jersey on and they wouldn\u2019t even recognize you. That was a moment where it hit me, there\u2019s emotion involved in the game and they want to win. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, there are cases where fans take it a little too far. SA:  Being brothers and so close, do you have similar personalities that you apply to this job? Or is there room for different demeanors and styles? I saw in your official NBA bios that John, you like to eat skirt steak, want to visit Rome and named American Airlines as your favorite app. Jacyn, you\u2019re veal parmigiana, Tahiti and Netflix. Jacyn Gobel:  We\u2019re slightly different. Like I\u2019m the one who\u2019s a little more adventurous. But my brother does a great job, and I\u2019m calling him all the time. He\u2019s my best friend. So if I\u2019m going to make a big purchase \u2013 a house, a car \u2013 I have to call him. He sees things a lot more level-headed, where I\u2019m more impulsive.  SA: I guess that makes sense. You\u2019re brothers, not twins. Jacyn Goble:  There\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat. SA:  Jacyn, considering your previous career, can we safely assume that handling tough characters and situations as a police officer for 13 years means you have little trouble handling players, coaches and tense NBA situations? Jacyn Goble:  Absolutely. It\u2019s very similar. I think any referee can be a cop. Because you have to make decisions, quick decisions where you have to discern whether something is legal or illegal and whether you make a call or not. Working with the police is the same thing. You have to make quick decisions whether to use your weapon or not, how to de-escalate situations \u2013 I think it\u2019s very similar. SA:  So John, it sounds like there\u2019s hope if you ever want to make the transition in the other direction. John Goble, shaking his head and smiling:  No. I\u2019ll be looking for some lonely high school that may have a vacating athletic director position that nobody else wants. SA:  Were you two athletes growing up? Was it basketball or other sports? John Goble: As kids we played all sports. But as we grew up we both really liked basketball more. So we both played that in high school. SA:  And you were respectful of the referees? John Goble:  I was way more respectful. SA: Wait, did you have run-ins? Ever get tossed? Jacyn Goble:  I got ejected from one game. I went at the official about a call I thought he should have made. It was late in the game to advance to the championship. Yeah. Wouldn\u2019t do that again. John Goble:  I had a bigger issue with my high school coach. I always worried if I did something against a referee and it cost our team a point, I\u2019d have a bigger issue after the game with him. SA:  It\u2019d be nice if all NBA players felt that way, huh? John Goble, laughing:  That\u2019s a better question for them to answer. SA:  Will we ever see you working the same game? John Goble: We\u2019ve never been told that we\u2019re not going to work together. I think it\u2019s just a by-product of the scheduling. If it ever does present itself it would be tremendous. It would be a great memory and a milestone years from now to say that we worked together. SA:  When was the last time you did officiate a game together? John Goble: Whew, not even in college. Probably an adult rec league game. SA:  Any chance it would be competitive, as far as who blew the whistle first or got a call right? Jacyn Goble:  No, more just good banter. Like \u201cThat was a really good call\u201d and being sarcastic. SA:  Do any coaches or players ever get you guys confused? Jacyn Goble:  Not yet at least. He has better hair than I do. John Goble:  Not by much. SA:  How much are you able to stay in touch during the season, when you\u2019re each bouncing around the league on completely difference schedules? John Goble:  All the time, actually. Whether we call each other or we text. I would say 70 percent of it is about how we\u2019re doing, what\u2019s going on with our families because we\u2019re gone so much. The rest, we will talk about the work aspect. About certain plays we had in games. Rules scenarios. How things were handled and what we can do better. Jacyn Goble:  It\u2019s more me asking him, \u201cWhat could I have done better?\u201d He\u2019s been to The Finals and he\u2019s a great referee. So as much as I can soak up from him. I talked to him today about certain plays that I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ll clip a play and send it to him, and we\u2019ll talk about it. SA:  You must share travel tips, as far as hotels and airlines and such. Jacyn Goble:  He gives me a lot. Every time I\u2019m in a pinch, the first person I call is him. He starts trying to work out on the phone while he\u2019s traveling, \u201cYou can jump on this flight. You can drive from here to there.\u201d Like Dallas and OKC, or if I\u2019m stuck in Chicago getting to Milwaukee. Little tricks of the trade. John Goble:  My flight this morning, I looked right away because living in Miami, American flies a lot of those 737 Max [airplanes, a Boeing product grounded last week by the FAA]. Turned out my flight was just a regular 737 but the one before mine was grounded. You just have to be pro-active. I know we\u2019re toward the end of winter now, but that\u2019s another little wrinkle that can get you. SA:  Any favorite restaurants on the road? I ask this recalling that when I put the question to former NBA ref Dick Bavetta, he answered \u201cEvery Marriott concierge lounge.\u201d I think Dick liked the prices there. John Goble:  Calderone Club in Milwaukee. Jacyn Goble:  When we go to [work at the replay center], Angelo\u2019s in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. John Goble:  [Fellow referee] Eric Dahlen in Minneapolis turned us on to J.D. Hoyt\u2019s. SA:  Do you have other ways you like to spend spare time on the road? John Goble:  If we get in the night before and the schedules work to where our partners get in early, we definitely like to break bread together. But for us, our blood is so thin, if we\u2019re in the Midwest in January, we might be staying in the hotel. SA:  NBA officials don\u2019t travel and work in static crews the way baseball deploys its umpires. What do you make of the impact that has on familiarity with your partners, covering for each other and communicating? John Goble:  When I first got on staff, you were broken down into four groups. Within your group, you had so many crew chiefs, so many part-time crew chiefs and then the less-experienced officials. The majority of the games, you worked within that group. A definite positive was you\u2019d create a little synergy with each other. Our communication improves based on the amount of time we spend with each other. But contrary to baseball and even football, by not being in those groups and by working with everybody, you start to create a bond with many more people on the staff. As opposed to being next to \u201cJoe Smith\u201d and, despite both of us being in the league for years, never having worked a game with him. It\u2019s like going to work and saying \u201cHi!\u201d to someone down the hall in the same office building, but you never really know them. SA:  Basketball is fundamentally different from the others in the interaction of officials. In baseball, for example, a third-base umpire isn\u2019t getting involved in bang-bang calls at first base or assessing the contact at second base on double plays. John Goble:  In NBA games, everybody\u2019s working the plate every night. That\u2019s where the time you spend together off the floor improves that trust we need. Sure, we have our mechanics and a system in place the way we officiate. But it\u2019s having that team concept. Unlike maybe baseball or football, because our game is so fluid, you could be in the proper position and the play could be in your primary area of coverage, but let\u2019s say some players get in front of you at the last second. That\u2019s where that trust is involved. Your partner might be farther away but see the entire play. SA:  Based on what happened recently in Salt Lake City, what was a basketball situation looked like it was going to become a police situation between Russell Westbrook and a fan. Just in general terms, Jacyn, how much are the referees tuned into what\u2019s going on between a player and someone in the stands? Jacyn Goble:  As far as fan interaction, even when there\u2019s a timeout, we\u2019re trying to observe everybody. Observe the scorer\u2019s table, both benches, what sort of communication is going on between us and the teams. So we always try to keep our heads on a swivel to make sure we\u2019re observing everything. But something like that, it definitely falls on the security personnel. SA:  Is there a protocol for how much you get in the middle of player skirmishes? Is that best to your judgment?  John Goble:  We\u2019re still observing after the whistle is blown, so if we see that two players maybe are starting to get a little feisty, if we can get in there and try to be a little preventative, say \u201cHey guys, hold on,\u201d we will. We\u2019ll try our best, but I\u2019m not 6-9, 260. Prior to replay, if I\u2019m not mistaken, it was part of our policy to have one official stand back so they can observe everything. So they\u2019d have more of a big picture view of what was going on. Jacyn Goble:  For me it is instinctive. It\u2019s something I had to deal with for 14 years. I was with a specialized unit \u2013 we went after robbery and homicide guys \u2013 and it\u2019s an instinct that you have. You just know. For me, it\u2019s not the person who initiates it. It\u2019s the person who retaliates \u2013 I try to get to him first. SA:  What do you miss most about being a police officer? Jacyn Goble:  It\u2019s something we touched on when we talked about getting in early and being able to get dinner with [the other referees]. My unit, we were tight. We had five guys who were together for almost five years. We\u2019d eat dinner. We had get-togethers at our houses, and we\u2019d bring the families along. Just that camaraderie. I miss that. SA:  But you\u2019ve still got partners on game night. And your whistle. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That wrist-tap signals \u201cDame Time\u201d and it gets a rise at Moda Center while uplifting the Portland Trail Blazers, who once again are in the thick of the Western Conference playoff chase . Portland mostly thrives on the flow of Lillard, its All-Star guard who is one of the top five most talented Blazers ever and is the unquestioned leader of the club the last half decade. But in a league where stars are often measured by their deep playoff runs, Lillard checks his watch and knows he\u2019s behind schedule. In his previous six seasons, the Blazers have just two West semifinals berths ( 2014 , 2016 ). Last season, they were first-round fodder for the New Orleans Pelicans after a 49-win season, becoming the first No. 3 seed to fall that early since 2001. It\u2019s not all his fault. though.

Still, it was a crushing experience for Lillard as he shot 35 percent, averaged four turnovers per game and was spooked by Jrue Holiday all series. Lillard beat himself up over the exit, saying it took \u201ca few months\u201d before his head stopped spinning. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I pouted for a while,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWatched TV and they were talking crap about me left and right.\u201d With Portland again poised to finish in the top four in the West \u2014 helped by a successful recent Eastern Conference road trip \u2014 Lillard and the Blazers field virtually the same team \u2026 but with a different swagger and mindset. \u201cPeople are sleeping on us,\u201d he said, then paused and added softly, \u201clet them.\u201d Lillard, 28, was expansive, thoughtful, direct and once again perky in a recent interview about both the Blazers and his being the face of the franchise. And make no mistake, it\u2019s a role he tightly embraces. Lillard\u2019s goal is to spend his entire career with one team, and a secondary goal is to convince free agents that Portland is a great place to play (and he\u2019d be an ideal running mate). Portland does dote on the Blazers and many ex-players eventually retire there long after they\u2019re done playing. As for Lillard, his teammates are warm to him, noting his leadership and support even though tough times, and of course marveling at his talent and preparation. On Friday, Lillard passed LaMarcus Aldridge for No. 2 on the club\u2019s all-time scoring list ( trailing only Clyde Drexler ). The outside world once swirled with rumors of a beef with Aldridge, now a seven-time All-Star who bolted for San Antonio in free agency after two seasons with Lillard (2013-15). \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate, how that perception played out,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. We have more of a relationship now when we\u2019re not teammates than when we were teammates. That\u2019s not a negative thing. We never had an issue as teammates. \u201cWe never had an argument. It was just outside noise and we never took the time to communicate and say `this ain\u2019t real, I don\u2019t feel that way.\u2019 But it\u2019s typical around the NBA, every time two good teammates are paired together they try to turn them against each other, comparing them and all that stuff instead of letting them be teammates. \u201cNow I\u2019ve played more years without him than with him. When he left I was put in a different role of leadership, responsibility, redemption and everything had to go up. Him leaving Portland allowed me getting to No. 2 to happen. Had he stayed, he would probably be No. 1 (on the scoring list) and I wouldn\u2019t have the chance to pass him until year 15. Everything happened for a reason.\u201d Lillard is grateful for the franchise because it was sold on him from the jump. In high school, Lillard wasn\u2019t heavily recruited and wound up at Weber State, which didn\u2019t offer the big-school exposure advantages. Yet the Blazers drafted him No. 6 in 2012 and placed the ball in his hands, where it has been ever since. \u201cI led the league in minutes as a rookie ,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe if they hadn\u2019t given me that opportunity and freedom to have the opportunity to be me, then maybe we wouldn\u2019t be here together. I owe a lot of people, our coaching staff and organization to allow me to do this from day one.\u201d Lillard has been an example of durability and determination, never missing a game his first three seasons as he has not missed more than nine games per season since then. Along the way, he has represented himself and Portland well, a refreshing change for a franchise that endured the \u201cJail Blazers\u201d regime and felt robbed by the constant injuries of Greg Oden, the former No. 1 overall pick chosen ahead of Kevin Durant in 2007 . Lillard, now a four-time All-Star, became good quickly and fun to watch. The 6-foot-3 combo guard is never bashful about launching 30 footers or challenging bigger defenders at the rim. That said, he often bristles at what he perceives as a lack of respect \u2014 perhaps borne of playing on the West Coast and in a small-market town \u2014 which is often taken the wrong way. What some may see as whining is a player with a sense of pride who wants his just due. Lillard has never been an All-Star starter. Last season was Lillard\u2019s inaugural one on the All-NBA first team , the honor coming at the expense of Russell Westbrook \u2014 who averaged a triple-double and was named Kia MVP in 2016-17. \u201cI\u2019m one of the best players in the NBA,\u201d said Lillard, unwilling to limit his status to point guards. \u201cTell me how I\u2019m not? That\u2019s not pride talking. That\u2019s facts.\u201d He paused. \u201cI have a chip on my shoulder for how I had to get here and where I come from, and also how I\u2019m viewed. Sometimes I\u2019m delusional about it. I might be wrong when I make myself think certain stuff. But it works for me. Every little thing I use as wood on the fire.\u201d All that\u2019s separating Lillard from a seat at the table of greatness is Portland playing in late May or early June. Plenty will depend on the recovery of backcourt mate CJ McCollum (popliteus strain), who could be out a week . While the Blazers are deep, there\u2019s no one player who can assume McCollum\u2019s role. \u201cYou\u2019re concerned for him as a friend, first and foremost, and he\u2019s so big for our team that you get concerned for that,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe have guys who can make up for the scoring by committee, but you also take them away from their roles. We\u2019re going to have to lean on each other a little bit more.\u201d While the Golden State Warriors are once again strong favorites, they\u2019re not unbeatable. Everyone else in the West brings a flaw. The Blazers added offensive-minded big man Enes Kanter last month, and he\u2019s been somewhat impressive since. Kanter should fortify Portland\u2019s frontcourt with Jusuf Nurkic and bring better balance to a team that long relied on Lillard and McCollum. \u201cLast year we got so hot and peaked really early,\u201d said Lillard, mentioning their 13-game win streak after the All-Star break, \u201cand I was like, \u2018man, I don\u2019t know how long any team other than the Warriors a few years ago can just play at that level for two months straight before you have a rough spot.\u2019 I thought about that last year when we went on that long winning streak and beating a bunch of good teams. I would\u2019ve loved for this streak to come right before the playoffs and going into the playoffs. This time we\u2019re playing good basketball but it\u2019s not like everything is going our way. I like the balance of it.\u201d After beating the Warriors by 22 last month , the Blazers went East and beat the Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics and narrowly lost to the Toronto Raptors. What did Lillard take from that? \u201cThe mentality we\u2019re capable of having over a long period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing into the trip we had to be sharp one game at a time and do the little things. The focus was there. The fact that it was a long trip and we knew what we were in for, it allowed us to get there mentality. We have to have that same approach as we go forward to the playoffs.\u201d For Lillard, the burn from last season\u2019s playoff exit won\u2019t truly be erased until the Blazers take the next step this spring. \u201cI had a lot of people I could lean on in situations like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tight with my mom, my dad, my brother, grandmother. They were all like, \u2018Hey, a lot of people saying that about you can never be in your shoes.\u2019 A lot of people who have something to say all the time, they\u2019re the same ones who can never be in my position. They can never know what it\u2019s like to have all these people coming down on you in a big moment and come up short. \u201cNot only can I deal with doing that, I know that I\u2019m going to bounce back. I\u2019m going to answer the call. It was just my turn and our turn as a group to go through it, our turn to go through that devastating time and it\u2019s about how you respond to it. We just want to get back to the playoffs and give ourselves a chance.\u201d L illard and the Blazers find themselves in the thick of would-be Warriors-slayers out West. And everyone is confident in late March. The bold truth isn\u2019t revealed until a series starts and every possession counts. What then? Lillard is anxious to find out, although he likes what his hunch is saying to him, and what he reminds his teammates almost daily: \u201cWe got to go out there and fight.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Unfortunately for the Pistons \u2014 who were the Eastern Conference\u2019s hottest team heading into the game \u2014 the Nets were a little more ready for it all. Brooklyn ramped up its defense and used a balanced offense to make quick work of Detroit and, for the moment, move into No. 6 in the playoff chase. Clippers 140, Celtics 115 \u2014 Behind a historic game from Lou Williams, the Clippers put an end to the good feelings the Celtics were having of late about themselves. Williams passed Dell Curry as the NBA\u2019s all-time leading bench scorer on Monday night, all while also (momentarily) moving the Clippers into the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference. Spurs 112, Mavericks 105 \u2014 Only in the Western Conference can a team (such as San Antonio) go on a win streak \u2026 and see little benefit in the standings from it. In toppling Dallas on Tuesday, San Antonio won its sixth straight game. However, by the end of the week and because of other teams\u2019 success around them, they only moved from No. 8 to No. 7. Thunder 108, Nets 96 \u2014 Sometimes, Russell Westbrook is just too much for any NBA defense to handle. Brooklyn got a first-hand look at that notion on Wednesday as Westbrook picked up career triple-double No. 130. He did so while ripping apart the Nets\u2019 defense and outplaying their star backcourt of Spencer Dinwiddie and D\u2019Angelo Russell. Warriors 106, Rockets 104 \u2014 No Kevin Durant for this one, but despite that, this Wednesday showdown had the usual thrills we\u2019ve come to expect from these two teams. Who knows if these teams will see each other again come playoff time. One thing we do know? DeMarcus Cousins (27 points, eight rebounds, seven assists) could end up as the X-factor player come the postseason. Bucks 113, Heat 98 \u2014 In the NBA, getting a team down by 20 points at halftime is a good way to ensure a win. On Friday, that world view of games got turned on its head. The Heat led 62-42 at halftime, but watched as the Bucks outscored them 71-46 in the second half, becoming the first team to be down by 20 points at halftime and go on to win by at least 15 points. Warriors 110, Thunder 88 \u2014 Durant missed this Saturday night reunion with his former team, but his Golden State teammates picked up the slack once again. Behind a monstrous game from Stephen Curry (33 points, 5-for-12 3-pointers), the Warriors ripped the Thunder in Oklahoma City to lock up what was once a big deal for Golden State: a playoff berth. Suns 138, Pelicans 136 (OT) \u2014 This showdown from Saturday gets a nod simply because of the odd way it ended. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry called a timeout with 1.1 seconds left after the Suns tied the game in overtime. Problem was, Gentry had no timeouts left. That sent Devin Booker to the line to seal the win and add to an already trying season for New Orleans. Bucks 130, Sixers 125 \u2014 Superstars often shine brightest when squaring off with an equally skilled rival. Such was the case on Sunday night, as Joel Embiid (40 points, 15 rebounds) put up a solid game, but was bested in that department by Giannis Antetokounmpo (career-high 52 points). However, it was Embiid\u2019s crew that got the win as the Sixers weathered a late push by the Bucks at home. DeMarcus Cousins (27 points, 11-16 FG, 8 reb, 7 ast, 2 stl in 31 minutes) \u2014 In short, the Rockets had no way of stopping the former All-Star big man in a ballyhooed Wednesday night showdown in Texas. Cousins spent the night punishing smaller Rockets defenders or, when double-teamed or trapped, making the right pass to keep Golden State\u2019s offense on track | Watch | Video box score Kyrie Irving (31 points, 11-28 FG, 10 reb, 12 ast in 37 minutes) \u2014 It is hard to believe a player as accomplished as Irving is has so few career triple-doubles. Yet, entering Thursday\u2019s game against the Kings, he had a grand total of one triple-double before running wild in a solid home win for the Celtics | Watch | Video box score Lou Williams (34 points, 14-20 FG, 4 reb, 5 ast in 23 minutes) \u2014 This is sure to be a game that Williams will remember, as he passed Dell Curry for the all-time lead in points scored by a bench player. Aside from that, this was a huge win for the Clippers as they look to solidify their place in the West hierarchy as their surprising push for a playoff spot rolls along. | Watch | Video box score Domantas Sabonis (26 points, 7-12 FG, 7 reb, 4 ast in 27 minutes) \u2014 Williams may be the odds-on favorite for the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award this season. However, this performance Sabonis delivered in Thursday\u2019s thrilling comeback win vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder is a prime example of why not to sleep on him has one of the NBA\u2019s best reserves. His energy and efficiency sparked a 19-point comeback in a thrilling home win for Indiana. | Watch | Video box score Bradley Beal (40 points, 12-17 FG, 9-12 3-pt FG, 5 reb, 7 ast, 2 stl in 38 minutes) \u2014 One of the underrated storylines in these final few weeks of 2018-19 is how Beal has raised his game as a scorer. He\u2019s averaging 31.2 ppg since Feb. 22 and this performance Saturday against the Hornets was a showcase of his shooting stroke and ability to take only the shots he needed to fuel a win vs. Charlotte. | Watch | Video box score Giannis Antetokounmpo (52 points, 15-26 FG, 3-8 3-pt FG, 19-21 FT, 16 reb, 7 ast, 2 stl in 36 minutes) \u2014 Part One of our homage to Sunday\u2019s superstar showdown in Milwaukee goes to \u201cThe Greek Freak.\u201d How could we not when he amassed a career high in points and logged the first 50-point, 15-rebound game since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it eons ago? | Watch | Video box score Joel Embiid (40 points, 15-31 FG, 4-13 3-pt FG, 15 reb, 6 ast, 3 stl in 35 minutes) \u2014 Part Two of the homage goes to Embiid, who did a fantastic job on offense, no doubt. But his impact in this game was felt on defense as well, as his size and the threat of his shot blocking threw off some aspects of the Bucks\u2019 offense in their loss Sunday. | Watch | Video box score \u201cI\u2019m sure y\u2019all have heard of it \u2013 \u201dAs the World Turns.\u201d She called it her stories.

That summer, Chamberlain was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that transaction, Chamberlain remained a Sixers legend in the minds of many. On March 18, 1991, that notion was made a fact when the Sixers retired Chamberlain\u2019s No. 13 jersey. Chamberlain played for the Sixers from 1964-68, snaring a scoring crown, three rebounding titles and an NBA championship in 1967. And, although he wasn\u2019t on the Sixers franchise when he logged his famous 100-point game (the Sixers did not exist yet), Chamberlain was playing in Philadelphia (for the Warriors) when he pulled that off on March 2, 1962 against the New York Knicks.  \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about all the rebounds and points I garnished, but I\u2019m counting a lot of friends. And I count all you guys among them. Thank you,\u201d Chamberlain said at the jersey retirement cermony. His No. 13 was the sixth number retired by the team, joining Julius Erving (No. 6), Bobby Jones (No. 24), broadcaster David Zinkoff, Billy Cunningham (No. 32) and former teammate Hal Greer (No. 15).

Philadelphia\u2019s Process vs. Milwaukee\u2019s Greek Freak. Get used to it. By the time Sunday\u2019s edition was cut, the pair of virally dubbed unicorns combined for 92 points, 31 rebounds, 13 assists and five steals in the Sixers\u2019 130-125 statement win . The \u201cunicorn\u201d label might be misleading when referring to two of the league\u2019s most unstoppable wrecking balls. They are north-to-south avalanches, disdaining the sides of the court because nothing can stop them in the middle:   Antetokounmpo\u2019s career-high 52 points were ultimately not enough, but that had more to do with Milwaukee needing 18 more 3-point attempts (16-for-50) to make just one more from beyond the arc than Philadelphia (15-for-32). On the other end, the Bucks\u2019 top-ranked defense struggled to corral the Sixers\u2019 stable of stars. That conundrum could be a problem this spring, but the new-look Sixers might undergo yet another makeover before autumn with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler both hitting free agency. And with Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving both older and unclear as to their own immediate futures, Sunday provided a glimpse into what we do know: Embiid and Antetokounmpo are destined for many, many more box-score-busting and trash-talk-exchanging bouts in the years to come. There\u2019s something about the elite and undersized scoring guards in the league. Call it hard-earned bravado, reps on the pickup court, whatever. They are among the most comfortable and deadly with time winding down and the game on the line. Lou Williams is the bannerman for that group, and the two-time Kia Sixth Man of the Year showed why with a 3-point dagger as time expired to give the Clippers a 119-116 win over the visiting Nets. As always, we rate game-winning buzzer-beaters on our Horry Scale. Reminder: The Horry Scale breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. DIFFICULTY: The set play out of the timeout was basic but effective for someone who can get his shot off as quickly as Williams. A pass and immediate screen from Danilo Gallinari gave Williams the sliver of airspace he needed to launch a straightaway 3, albeit over an understandably desperate double-team. Despite the pressure and launching from no-man\u2019s land between the arc and center court logo, the shot hit nothing by twine. GAME SITUATION:  There was little pressure on Williams or the Clippers in the moment with the game merely tied, but the standings tell another story. Lose in overtime, and the Clippers would have found themselves in eighth place, an entire game back of Utah and potentially facing the two-time defending champion Warriors in the first round. The Clippers, Jazz and Spurs are all actively trying to avoid that draw. Now LA finds itself in a virtual tie with Utah and only a half game back of San Antonio. In the season\u2019s final leg, the Clippers are still running strong. Another factor: the symbolic image of a Williams moment amid a particularly heated Kia Sixth Man of the Year race. Many voters will choose Williams, whose 20-plus points per game jump off the page. Others may prefer the blue collar work of teammate Montrzel Harrell or Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis. Yet when casting aside preference and gauging the candidates\u2019 simple on-court effect, Williams should be the runaway favorite. Here\u2019s how much better each team\u2019s net rating is with their respective sixth man contender on the floor: Lou Williams: +10.1 Domantas Sabonis: +3.5 Montrezl Harrell: +2.3 Spencer Dinwiddie: -1.1 CELEBRATION: Amid all the changes LA has made since the Lob City era, Williams\u2019 two years with the Clippers seem an eternity. He has become their soul, the gritty spirit of the team\u2019s nobody-should-ever-underestimate-us vibe that will carry them to the playoffs even after trading away Tobias Harris. That\u2019s why Williams\u2019 teammates didn\u2019t hesitate to rush the veteran and hoist him on their shoulders, even as he gestured to a home fan base that has embraced him as readily as the team itself. When the team owner gets two-stepping, you know you\u2019re doing something right. GRADE: With the Nets just as desperately immersed in their own playoff race out East, the outcome mattered enormously to both teams. Williams is the argument for why the Clippers could be dangerous in the first round. He\u2019s been there, and he\u2019s equipped to steal the win if it\u2019s there for the taking. 4 Horrys . Those who have played know. In order to do the near impossible, hold the turbo button and jump. Maybe that\u2019s what New York\u2019s Mario Hezonja did in his game-winning block of LeBron James. Or maybe Hezonja was simply the beneficiary of some two-player strategy? We often allude to hustle or other intangibles as traits that aren\u2019t rewarded nearly enough. Mike Scott had enough of that, apparently. After selling out to chase a loose ball out of bounds, the veteran forward treated himself to a drink, courtesy of the fan who cushioned his fall. In fairness to Scott, he has seen his minutes nearly double (14.6 to 26.2 per game) since the All-Star break. The guy needed a little hydration. We\u2019ll never know exactly how dominant Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain were on defense. It\u2019s a travesty of stat tracking, since blocks and steals were not recorded in that day and age. Since the league wised up, it\u2019s been easier to catalog the all-around defensive terror of legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Garnett and Hakeem Olajuwon. In one sense, Detroit center Andre Drummond passed them all on Sunday. The big man\u2019s 15 points, 17 rebounds and two steals in Detroit\u2019s upset win over Toronto clinched his fourth season of at least 1,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, 100 steals and 100 blocks. Previously, no other player in NBA history had more than three such seasons under his belt since blocks and steals became an official thing in 1973-74.

Sure, you want to see the big-name teams with the brightest stars in the network games. But if the calendar says anything before the second weekend in April, you\u2019ve learned to have your guard up. Injuries, \u201cload management,\u201d rotation tinkering and even occasional sandbagging can thwart a showdown in the regular season that would have NBA fans salivating in the postseason. Fortunately for folks showing up and tuning in Sunday afternoon, neither the Philadelphia 76ers nor the Milwaukee Bucks were in position to play left-hand through their matinee at Fiserv Forum. The Bucks were at home, defending a 27-5 mark in Milwaukee while coping with the loss of starting guard Malcolm Brogdon (right foot, plantar fascia tear). Brogdon is the only player in the league shooting at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from the arc and 90 percent from the foul line. His absence would show in a shaky shooting performance by his teammates. The Sixers, meanwhile, were jazzed about starting their preferred lineup for only the seventh time all season. Tobias Harris\u2019 arrival last month before the trade deadline, followed by injuries to Joel Embiid and Jimmy Butler, had limited coach Brett Brown to just a half dozen games to all three with backcourt Ben Simmons and J.J. Redick. Continuity matters for contenders, as does familiarity, so Philadelphia had four weeks beginning Sunday to get fully acquainted. \u201cSixers 3.0,\u201d Redick said afterward of this latest incarnation. Said Brown: \u201cThere is no right to have a fluid side and a chemistry and symmetry. [We] have no right to have that. It\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault but the calendar\u2019s. Growing and being excited about that and trying to polish that before the playoffs begin is our goal.\u201d The goal looked a little more in focus after the Sixers\u2019 130-125 victory. What it lacked in drama \u2014 after the early minutes of the second quarter, Philadelphia\u2019s lead only slipped to within a single possession in the final seconds, with Milwaukee desperately fouling \u2014 it made up for in moments. And individual performances. And strategies and counters to file away should they see each other again in May (they also meet April 4 in Philadelphia). Embiid was a monster for the Sixers with 40 points, 15 rebounds, six assists and three steals . His most promising stat might have been his 15-of-31 shooting. Twice this season, the Philadelphia center had been limited (by his team or the other guys) to single digits in field-goal attempts. Eight of the 11 games in which he shot the ball 15 times or fewer came before Christmas. But he\u2019s averaging about 22 shots in his four games back after missing eight (left knee soreness) after the All-Star break. That\u2019s a career high level and a better number both for him and his team, made possible by the threats surrounding him now. Butler, meanwhile, scored 14 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter, taking command at his favorite time of the game and taking air out of the ball from Milwaukee\u2019s late gasps. As for Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s monster performance \u2014 a career-high 52 points, with 16 rebounds, seven assists , a plus-12 rating, 19-of-21 from the foul line and three 3-pointer in eight tries \u2014 even that meant something positive for the Sixers. They stuck to their schemes, didn\u2019t overreact to the Greek Freak\u2019s enormity and got some video to bone up on, should they meet for four or more this spring. You might think a defensive player\u2019s shoulders would sag to see Antetokounmpo, so dangerous in most other ways, pulling up \u2014 and hitting \u2014 from the arc. But the Sixers had made up their mind to live or even die with that Sunday, simply filing it away. \u201cI think they feel the same way about me,\u201d Embiid said, after making four of his 13 3-point shots. \u201cThey let me shoot, they left me wide open the whole night from three. If he\u2019s going to go 10-for-15 from three, we can make some adjustment. But that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to live with.\u201d That would have been a postseason move, Brown said. Besides, Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates were cooperating, shooting 13-of-42 on 3-pointers, just 4-of-7 from the line and 28-of-69 (40.6 percent) overall. Even Milwaukee\u2019s first 50-point, 15-rebound game since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played here couldn\u2019t make up for those numbers. \u201cFor this game we were probably going to ride it out,\u201d the Sixers coach said. \u201cThe phrasing that most comes to my mind when you ask that question is \u2018tolerance level.\u2019 \u2026 There\u2019s a point where you say, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough.\u2019 Tonight wasn\u2019t going to be one of those nights for me.  \u201cIn the event you do match up in the playoffs, what can you learn, especially how to beat \u2018em in a four-game series? Maybe that philosophy would change in that type of environment. But tonight I feel like we were going to stay in our schemes and live with it.\u201d More than a few Sixers referred afterward to Milwaukee as the NBA\u2019s best team \u201cby record,\u201d an asterisk implied. You\u2019ll get arguments on both sides whether there truly are \u201cstatement games\u201d that have legs into the playoffs. So let\u2019s just say Philadelphia laid down a marker. And its greatest challenge will come from within. \u201cThe key thing is we\u2019ve all got to stay healthy,\u201d Embiid said of the next four weeks. \u201cWe go from there. We play together. We\u2019re learning how to play with each other. We feel comfortable with each other. We know where all of us want the ball at when we\u2019re all comfortable. We\u2019ve got time to figure it all out. We\u2019ve won four games in a row, so that\u2019s a good start.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Bucks superstar became the 11th different player to score at least 50 points in a game this season, which sets a new NBA record.

With that in mind, and on a night where nine teams currently in the playoff field hit the court, let\u2019s examine three things: How each squad in the playoff chase fared, where each of them reside in the standings, and what lies ahead for these crop of postseason hopefuls. The Celtics continued their push for home court in the first round after holding off a late surge from the Hawks, picking up a 129-120 victory. All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving led the team in points (30), rebounds (11) and assists (9) as Boston won its fifth game in the last six outings. Brad Stevens\u2019 group is currently one game behind the persevering Pacers for fourth in the East, with both squads facing off two more times before the season ends. Those contests, which could possibly determine who attains home court, are critical as the season series is currently split 1-1. Biggest game this week : @ Philadelphia (Wednesday, 8 ET, ESPN) Boston trails the 76ers by a half game and will look to make a statement and go for the season sweep. Next five games : Denver, @ Philadelphia, @ Charlotte, San Antonio, @ Cleveland  Brooklyn dropped to 0-2 to begin its seven-game road trip, losing in Utah 114-98 . It\u2019s a brutal stretch for the Nets, who are seeking their first playoff appearance since the 2013-14 season. The Nets don\u2019t play another home game until March 30, when they begin a three-game homestand against the Bucks, Celtics and Raptors. How welcoming. Biggest game this week : @ L.A. Lakers (Friday, 10:30 ET, League Pass) Who would\u2019ve thought a LeBron James-led squad would be their easiest opponent this week? Next five games : @ LA Clippers, @ Sacramento, @ L.A. Lakers, @ Portland, @ Philadelphia Nikola Jokic\u2019s ejection didn\u2019t cost the Nuggets as they were able to hang on against Indiana, winning 102-100. The Nuggets also remain one game behind the two-time defending champs for the top seed out West. They\u2019ll have a chance to split the season series with Golden State on April 2 in Oakland. As for this week, the Nuggets are about to begin a four-game road trip, and they\u2019ll need \u201cBig Honey.\u201d Biggest game this week : @ Boston (Monday, 7:30 ET, League Pass) The Nuggets look to start a four-game road trip against the East on a good note. Next five games : @ Boston, @ Washington, @ New York, @ Indiana, Detroit The Pacers shot 0-for-8 from deep in the second half, which crippled their chances of upsetting the Nuggets on the road in a 102-100 defeat. Indiana, fourth in the Eastern Conference, is one game ahead of the Celtics and a half game behind the 76ers for third place. Their schedule this week could determine their ultimate standing come April as they\u2019re currently on a four-game West road trip, with the Blazers, Clippers and Warriors upcoming. Biggest game this week : @ Portland (Monday, 10:30 ET, ESPN) It\u2019s crucial the Pacers steal a game during this four-game road trip against the West. Here\u2019s their best opportunity. Next five games : @ Portland, @ LA Clippers, @ Golden State, Denver, @ Oklahoma City  Golden State has made a statement over the past eight days by silencing three other elite teams in the Western Conference: Denver was no match, Houston\u2019s comeback bid fell short and Oklahoma City felt the wrath of the Splash Bros yet again. The Warriors cruised to a 110-88 win over the Thunder behind 33 points from Stephen Curry and 23 from Klay Thompson. The win clinched a playoff spot for the defending champs. Golden State remains one game ahead of the Nuggets for the West\u2019s No. 1 seed. Biggest game this week : @ San Antonio (Monday, 8 ET, ESPN) Kevin Durant, who missed his second game with an ankle injury, is expected back for Monday\u2019s game against the Spurs when the Warriors will have another opportunity to humble a Western Conference challenger. Next five games : @ San Antonio, @ Minnesota, Indiana, Dallas, Detroit  The Thunder have lost nine of their last 14 games, with their latest setback coming at the hands of Golden State after falling 110-88 on their home floor. If the season ended today, Oklahoma City would not have home-court advantage. To make matters worse, among the eight teams currently in the West playoff picture, the Thunder have the toughest schedule remaining . Biggest game this week : Toronto (Wednesday, 9:30 ET, ESPN) Oklahoma City must prove its still a formidable opponent heading into the playoffs by winning at least one of these back-to-back games against Toronto. Next five games : Miami, Toronto, @ Toronto, @ Memphis, Indiana Portland lost in a possible playoff preview against the Spurs, falling 108-103 . The team\u2019s biggest concern, however, is the health of shooting guard CJ McCollum. Midway through the third quarter, McCollum was helped off the court after suffering a left knee injury. Further details should be provided on Sunday as he\u2019s slated for an MRI. The Blazers are fourth in the Western Conference, a game behind the third-place Rockets and a half game ahead of the Thunder. Portland opens up its final homestand of the season on Monday, a consequential four-game stretch as the team fights for positioning. Biggest game this week : Indiana (Monday, 10:30 ET, ESPN) It\u2019s a tough test for Terry Stotts\u2019 crew whether their starting guard plays or not, and it\u2019s against a team that has still thrived despite losing their starting guard to injury. Next five games : Indiana, Dallas, Detroit, Brooklyn, @ Chicago LaMarcus Aldridge struggled against his former team, but the Spurs did just enough to put away the Blazers 108-103. Seven players reached double figures and San Antonio earned its eighth consecutive victory. The Spurs have boasted the No. 1 ranked defense in the NBA during their winning streak. They\u2019re sixth in the Western Conference and just 2.5 games back of the West\u2019s third seed, a finish not out of the question considering the way they\u2019re playing. It\u2019s a tough upcoming week ahead, however, but they enter it with confidence after knocking off the Thunder, Nuggets, Bucks and Blazers during their recent roll. Biggest game this week : Golden State (Monday, 8 ET, ESPN) The hottest team in the West puts itself to the test against the team out to make another statement. Next five games : Golden State, Miami, @ Houston, @ Boston, @ Charlotte Rudy Gobert overcame an illness and dropped 23 points and 17 rebounds in a win over the Nets. The Jazz are currently in seventh place in the West, which would setup a showdown with the Nuggets. Benefiting from the league\u2019s easiest remaining schedule , however, should allow them to make a jump. Biggest game this week :  @ New York (Wednesday, 7:30 ET, League Pass) Donovan Mitchell returning home adds some intrigue to a week full of below. 500 opponents. Next five games : @ Washington, @ New York, @ Atlanta, @ Chicago, Phoenix First, let\u2019s just marvel at what we\u2019re witnessing from Bradley Beal. The Wizards All-Star shooting guard was scorching hot against the Grizzlies and logged a 40-point performance for the second night in a row. His masterpiece on Saturday included a career-high nine 3-pointers, seven assists, five rebounds and two steals in a Wizards\u2019 135-128 triumph. Beal is averaging 31.2 points on 50\/40\/85 shooting splits since the All-Star break \u2014 a monster stretch that has fortified his All-NBA case \u2014 but the Wizards are 6-6 during that span and need to pick up the pace for any shot at the playoffs. Washington is still on the fringe, moving within three games of eighth-place Miami after Saturday\u2019s win. Biggest game this week : Miami (Saturday, 7 ET, League Pass) The Wizards are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference and a win against the Heat would help damage the standing of a team slightly ahead of them. Next five games : Utah, @ Chicago, Denver, Miami, @ Los Angeles Switching gears to teams headed towards the lottery. The Pelicans lost in overtime to the Suns after a bizarre sequence that was just another reason New Orleans is slated to miss the playoffs. The Anthony Davis drama has certainly impacted their season, but it was shades of another power forward that ultimately cost them Saturday\u2019s game: Chris Webber. New Orleans called a timeout it did not have with 1.1 seconds left in overtime, setting up a Devin Booker technical free throw that sealed a 138-136 Suns\u2019 victory. Let\u2019s rewind a bit: The Pelicans had a 136-133 lead plus possession of the ball with 7.7 seconds remaining in the game. From there, they turned the ball over with a five-second violation; opted not to foul on the ensuing Suns possession despite being up three and the clock winding down; watched Josh Jackson hit a game-tying 3; then proceeded to call a non-existent timeout to draw a technical. It was a terrible way to lose, but after all, it is March Madness (sorry C-Webb)."},{"id":46502,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/westbrook-faces-mandatory-suspension-16th-technical","date":"2019-03-17","title":"Westbrook faces mandatory suspension after 16th technical","content":"Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook faces a mandatory one-game suspension after picking up his 16th technical foul of the season in Saturday\u2019s clash with the Golden State Warriors.

Their first three opponents, however, are finally set. The Americans\u2019 quest for an unprecedented third consecutive FIBA World Cup championship will start against the Czech Republic, followed by games against Turkey and Japan later in the group stage. The draw for the 32-team tournament was held on Saturday in Shenzhen, China, which will be one of the sites for the event that starts on Aug. 31. \u201cWe are ready for the world,\u201d said Yao Ming, the best Chinese player ever, the longtime Houston Rockets star and one of the global ambassadors for the World Cup. In basketball-crazed China, they will indeed be ready to host. But it remains to be seen if anyone will be ready for the Americans. The U.S. is the top-ranked team in the world and coach Gregg Popovich \u2013 taking over for Mike Krzyzewski, whose run as head coach ended with three Olympic gold medals and the last two World Cup championships as well \u2013 will head to China with a roster filled by NBA talent. Reigning NBA MVP James Harden says he wants to play, and he\u2019s among 15 current All-Stars who are in the U.S. player pool for this national team. \u201cAs a basketball player, that\u2019s one of the highest points you can get for basketball,\u201d Harden said. \u201cObviously, you\u2019ve got the NBA and you have winning a championship and all that good stuff, but with this, you\u2019re not just playing for your respective cities or where you\u2019re from, you\u2019re playing for an entire country you represent. So, it\u2019s pretty awesome to be a part of it.\u201d Popovich, the longtime San Antonio coach, acknowledged that the World Cup has been on his mind \u2013 even in the midst of an NBA playoff push. \u201cWe\u2019ll face three well-coached teams and a variety of playing styles,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSelecting and preparing the USA team in a short amount of time will be a challenge and repeating as gold medalists for a third straight FIBA World Cup is something everyone associated with the USA team will embrace.\u201d Turkey is the second-ranked team in Group E, USA Basketball\u2019s group. It was known Friday, a day before the draw, that Turkey had to be in the same group as the Americans because of the way that other teams from the Americas were placed into pods. So Ersan Ilyasova, who plans to play for Turkey, knew long before the rest of the group was picked that his country will face a serious challenge. \u201cIn my experience, the World Cup is not about the first round \u2013 it\u2019s all about the second round,\u201d Ilyasova said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy. But it\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d Second-ranked Spain will meet Puerto Rico, Iran and Tunisia in the group stage. Third-ranked France drew the Dominican Republic, Germany and Jordan as its early opponents. Spain won the World Cup in 2006, led by Pau Gasol \u2013 and he\u2019s hoping to play for his country this summer as well. \u201cThat was probably one of the best moments of my career,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cSo if we have a chance to go for it this summer, we will.\u201d Host China is in the easiest group, Group A \u2013 where no team is currently ranked higher than No. 20. The Chinese are paired with Venezuela, Poland and Ivory Coast. The toughest group, on paper, looks to be Group H where No. 6 Lithuania, No. 11 Australia, No. 23 Canada and No. 37 Senegal will vie for two spots in the second round. At stake for teams in the World Cup: The Naismith Trophy, which longtime NBA star Kobe Bryant brought onto the stage Saturday and handed to Yao for safekeeping, as well as a berth in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. There will be 12 teams in the Olympic field \u2013 host Japan is one, and seven other nations will directly qualify from the World Cup. The other four will reach Tokyo through qualifying tournaments over the next year. The U.S. will be the favorites at the World Cup. Bryant said he expects competition to be stiff. \u201cIt\u2019s a greater sense of honor to be playing for your country,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cWhen you start out the game, you hear your national anthem being played, you see everybody in the arena with their flags representing their country and color, it\u2019s just such a great honor to be a part of that. It\u2019s extremely special.\u201d The group phase lasts through Sept. 5, and all three U.S. games in that round will be played in Shanghai.

The fourth proved more repeat than reprieve: 34-18 again, with Kia MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo dropping 11 points, six rebounds and three assists to seal an astounding comeback.

Much of it has to do with a 6-foot-11 playmaker who can drop dimes like this on the way to a final line of 33 points (12-19 FGs), 16 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and three blocks: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re down 20, 15, 10,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep playing hard. It\u2019s a process. You\u2019ve got to win games like this. You\u2019ve got to face adversity when you\u2019re playing on the road. In the playoffs, it\u2019s not going to be easy. We want to be a great team and that\u2019s why we keep playing hard.\u201d At least, postgame, Dwyane Wade\u2019s #OneLastDance jersey exchange took a heartening turn, as he connected with Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, who has been working his way back from a scary spinal injury in 2017. The two-time Pro Bowl linebacker had reached out to Wade via Twitter with a message expressing his admiration of the NBA star, and Wade invited him out to make the dream a reality. An NBA rarity occurred during the third quarter of the LA Clippers 128-121 win against the Chicago Bulls \u2013 head coaches Doc Rivers and Jim Boylen were simultaneously ejected with a minute remaining in the third quarter. The trigger for all the drama was a screen by Montrezl Harrell, immediately whistled as an offensive foul. That led to emphatic agreement by Boylen, most notable in some vigorous clapping, and an exchange of words with Rivers. And then a few more. And a few more and \u2026 here\u2019s the official ruling: After the game, Boylen said that he felt the Clippers \u201cwent after [his] second PG and [he] didn\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d Rivers said he told Boylen in response that \u201cMaybe [he] should turn to his players and tell them to call out screens.\u201d The season series is now complete, with the Clippers taking both games. But don\u2019t be surprised if the Clippers\u2019 screening \u2013 fairly or not \u2013 causes a flare during the always-at-11 intensity of the postseason. These type of incidents tend to linger in the collective mind. One to track. The Pistons have been among the league\u2019s hottest teams coming out of the All-Star break, and Blake Griffin has continued to provide a foundational piece, averaging 24.9 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.4 assists. He\u2019s also greatly improved both his ballhandling and 3-point shooting in recent seasons, firing away a career-high 6.8 attempts from behind-the-arc \u2013 up from 1.9 two years ago and 0.5 in 2015-16 \u2013 along with a career-high 29.4 percent of his shots coming after 3-6 dribbles (vs. 18.2 percent in \u201916-17). In Saturday\u2019s 111-97 romp against the Lakers, both were on display in one vicious highlight. Damian Lillard is now No. 2 on Portland\u2019s all-time scoring list , passing LaMarcus Aldridge with a pullup 3 toward the end of the first half. Clyde Drexler leads the chart with 18,040, about a 3-to-4-year pace for Lillard from his perch of 12,584. \u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d Lillard said, postgame. \u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d Spurs center Jakob Poeltl took an all-too-relatable L, getting literally roasted after falling asleep in the sun. He pulled together to tally 12 points, nine rebounds and five blocks as San Antonio rocked the Knicks, 109-83 . Poeltl did apparently throw on a T-shirt underneath the jersey for the second half. Gotta watch that chafe. Joel Embiid has wondered why defenders keep biting on his pump fake, given his 28.9 percent 3-point shooting on 3.9 attempts per game. And yet, again: Embiid finished with 21 points, 15 rebounds, three assists and four blocks in a 123-114 victory over the Sacramento Kings. All five Philadelphia starters scored at least 19 points, and the Sixers rose to third on the East via tiebreaker. Both the Sixers and Pacers are up two games on fifth-place Boston. Robin Lopez\u2019s ongoing war with mascots leaguewide continued out in Los Angeles, with Chuck the Condor taking an L. Wig.

The ban comes three days after issuing their first such ban to a fan for similar actions. According to the The Deseret News \u2018 Eric Woodyard and The Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s Eric Walden and Andy Larsen , the fan being banned is one who used a derogatory term in talking to Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook during the 2018 playoffs. The video in question is one from the 2018 playoffs, in which the fan \u2014 who has not been identified by either newspaper or the team \u2014 called Westbrook \u201cboy\u201d before Game 4 of last year\u2019s first-round series . In the video, Westbrook says \u201cdon\u2019t call me boy,\u201d and warned the fan before the fan said it again. Westbrook then flagged down security to handle the matter. Per Woodyard, the team conducted an investigation to track down the fan from the previously leaked video. Per Walden and Larsen, team president Steve Sarks told the newspaper that the Jazz would investigate prior violations and consider additional retroactive bans. \u201cWe\u2019ll need look into every situation if there\u2019s video evidence, if its clear they\u2019ve violated the Code of Conduct. We would review any of the situations,\u201d Sarks told The Salt Lake Tribune . \u201cOne of the things that people may not realize is that the renovation allowed us to be more aware of what\u2019s going on in the arena. We have a command center where we can see every seat in the arena, and we have video. It\u2019s not to spy on people, but it\u2019s to make sure that we\u2019re taking care of guest service issues.\u201d The video came to light as the Jazz were investigating the actions of a fan identified as Shane Keisel on Monday. He was issued a lifetime ban on Wednesday after the Jazz determined that a viral video in which Westbrook threatened to beat up Keisel and his wife was brought on by Keisel directing racially-tinged comments at Westbrook in Monday\u2019s game. Westbrook was fined $25,000 for \u201cdirecting profanity and threatening language to a fan.\u201d In the video, which was posted to Twitter by The Deseret News , Westbrook is seen on the sideline near the Thunder bench saying \u201cI\u2019ll (bleep) you up, you and your wife.\u201d \u201cThe Utah Jazz will not tolerate fans who act inappropriately,\u201d the Jazz said in a statement. \u201cThere is no place in our game for personal attacks or disrespect.\u201d Keisel, denied saying anything improper or profane . The Jazz did not name Keisel in their statement announcing the ban, and a phone number for him rang unanswered, The Associated Press reports. Before Thursday\u2019s Jazz-Timberwolves game at Vivint Smart Home Arena, Utah owner Gail Miller released a statement and spoke to the crowd to address the Westbrook-fan interaction from earlier in the week. Miller, who has owned the Jazz for 34 years with her late husband Larry, implored the crowd to do better and said, \u201cWe are not a racist community\u201d before a 120-100 win against Minnesota . She implored fans to enjoy the competition and cheer the Jazz as loudly as ever but cautioned, \u201cNo one wins when respect goes away.\u201d Players from both teams listened intently and applauded the speech. Per The Salt Lake Tribune , the Jazz periodically flashed a message across the arena\u2019s screens last night which stated: \u201c\u201cNo disruptive behavior. Obscene language or gestures, fighting, throwing objects, attempting to enter the court or interrupting play. Spectators engaging in such behavior are subject to ejection and other penalties, including a lifetime ban.\u201d Before last night\u2019s game, Miller also sent an e-mail to fans, which spelled out what will not be tolerated going forward. Sarks expressed disgust to The Salt Lake Tribune over the incident in which Westbrook was called \u201cboy\u201d and called for fans to be vigilant in reporting other incidents they may see or hear. \u201cMy reaction was a lot of disappointment, that one of our fans was using degrading language language, racist language. I was also disappointed that the people around the fan didn\u2019t speak up in the moment,\u201d Starks said, per the newspaper. \u201cThey\u2019re two isolated events, but it illustrates we need to be proactive in addressing this.\u201d There is a fan code of conduct at all NBA games, including a part that says guests \u201cwill enjoy the basketball experience free from disruptive behavior, including foul or abusive language or obscene gestures.\u201d Violators are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and each team handles things its own way. At the Utah game Monday night, some fans were issued warning cards but allowed to return to their seats. Westbrook has been upset about fans in Utah before. The Jazz eliminated the Thunder from last season\u2019s playoffs, and as Westbrook walked off the floor immediately after that loss, he swiped at a fan who was taping him with his phone. Later that night, Westbrook described fans in Utah as \u201ctruly disrespectful.\u201d Westbrook and the Thunder have finished their season series with the Jazz. Unless the teams meet in the playoffs, the earliest he would play again in Salt Lake City is next October. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":34957,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-out-load-management-pistons","date":"2019-03-15","title":"Lakers' James (load management) won't play tonight vs. Pistons","content":" Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James will not be playing tonight against the Detroit Pistons ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ).  The team announced that James will miss the game for \u201cload management, groin\u201d reasons. Roughly a week ago, the Lakers and James reportedly agreed to a minutes restriction for their All-Star forward. At the time, the team reportedly planned to rest James for any remaining back-to-back games in what was being termed a \u201ccool down\u201d period for James.    The Lakers suffered a 111-98 road loss to the Toronto Raptors last night that dropped them to 31-37. James played in that game, finishing with a team-best 29 points as well as four rebounds and six assists. The Lakers are No. 11 in the Western Conference playoff chase , but have 12 games left with opponents who boast a combined .519 winning percentage.  After eight straight trips to the NBA Finals, the 34-year-old has played by far the most minutes of any player in the NBA since 2010. James missed a career-high 17 straight games with a strained left groin earlier this season. Since the injury, the Lakers have posted a record of 11-23.  The four-time NBA MVP is averaging 27.4 points, 8.6 rebounds and 8.0 assists over 50 games during his first season with the Lakers.  Aside from James\u2019 absence tonight, the team lists Josh Hart (right knee tendinitis) as questionable and Reggie Bullock (left foot contusion) and Lance Stephenson (left foot, second toe sprain) as probable.

But that didn\u2019t prevent a television reporter who was part of the media huddled around the 6-foot-11 Gafford in the Razorbacks\u2019 locker room to ask the inevitable question about when he was going to make the jump to the NBA. Gafford\u2019s answer spoke volumes about his character. \u201cI just want to focus on the team right now,\u201d Gafford said. The Gators buried Arkansas\u2019 slim NCAA tournament hopes, and at 17-15, there\u2019s no guarantee of an NIT bid, either. It\u2019s doubtful the Hogs would play in one of the other, alphabet soup (CIT, CBI) events, so with an early start on spring break. Gafford, a projected first-round NBA Draft pick, could also get an early start on his decision-making process. A year ago, after his freshman season, Gafford surprised some Draft analysts by consulting with the Arkansas coaching staff and his family and deciding to return to school, even though he was generally regarded as first-round material. \u201cIt was a mature decision,\u201d says Arkansas associate head coach Melvin Watkins, \u201cto say \u2018I\u2019m not quite ready yet, and I\u2019m enjoying the college experience.\u2019 In today\u2019s world, you get so many outside influences, trying to give you their opinions. Some of them are self-serving. Some are motivating.\u201d Suffice it to say Gafford listened to those opinions in the latter camp, the people who thought he had some work left to do before he should even consider the NBA. He was motivated to improve, and improve he did. \u201cI wanted to work on my body,\u201d says Gafford, who weighs about 235, \u201cand be more physical in the post. I wanted to move my game out to the free-throw line where I could attack the basket, and I wanted to work on my jump shot. But I didn\u2019t shoot that many jumpers this year, which was a disappointment to me.\u201d In warmups before the Florida game, Gafford consistently made mid-range jumpers. But unguarded shots are one thing. Making them with a hand in your face is another. \u201cHe\u2019s still got some work to do there,\u201d Watkins says. \u201cHe\u2019s a little inconsistent. He can shoot it; he just doesn\u2019t have all the confidence in it.\u201d Gafford knew after Arkansas lost All-SEC guards Jaylen Barford (17.9 ppg) and Daryl Macon (16.8) from last season\u2019s NCAA team he\u2019d have to step up his production, even though he\u2019d averaged 20.9 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.8 blocked shots per 40 minutes as a freshman. Gafford delivered a first-team All-SEC season during which he led the league in field-goal percentage (66.0) and rebounding (8.7). was third in blocked shots (2.0) and fourth in scoring (17.0). Gafford made the most field goals in the SEC and was third in double-doubles. One of those double-doubles was witnessed by former Razorback All-American center Joe Kleine, pressed into emergency duty as a color analyst when Arkansas played Alabama in a game broadcast on the SEC Network. Gafford hammered the Crimson Tide\u2019s solid front line with 29 points, 16 rebounds, two assists and two blocks, a performance that impressed Kleine, who played 15 years in the NBA. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that close and see the things Daniel does \u2014 and does them with ease \u2014 it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Kleine told Hawgs Illustrated . \u201cI\u2019ve only seen one other guy in college basketball this season who\u2019s a better athlete than Daniel, and that\u2019s Zion Williamson.\u201d High praise indeed. The consensus among mock drafts is that, should Gafford decide to leave college, he\u2019ll be a mid first-round pick. If NBA teams are convinced Gafford can take that jumper of his from warmups to games, his stock could rise even higher. His size, body and athleticism are that of a prototypical next-level forward, and he\u2019s inspired to continue to develop his skills. \u201cHe\u2019s so athletic,\u201d Watkins says. \u201cHe has that lean build and can get up and down the floor \u2014 I don\u2019t know that you can find a big guy that can run the floor like he can and with that kind of ability. With what he has naturally, and as he continues to grow into the game, I think his upside is unlimited.\u201d Suffice it to say if this was Gafford\u2019s final season, it didn\u2019t turn out the way he\u2019d hoped. The Razorbacks finished 8-10 in SEC games, enduring losing streaks of four games in January, and an NCAA tournament bid-crippling six in February. That left them in the unenviable position of having to win four games in as many days at the SEC tournament in Nashville to ensure a trip to the Big Dance. That quest ended before it began after Florida made sure Gafford, who was limited to 15 points and six boards, wouldn\u2019t dominate the game. Many times, adversity is a better teacher than success, though, and Gafford learned a lot. \u201cYou can\u2019t play soft,\u201d Gafford says, referring to his team. \u201cYou can\u2019t play like kids. You\u2019ve got to play like grown men.\u201d Then, assessing his own game, Gafford talked about evolving into the Razorbacks\u2019 go-to guy and how he had to learn to play with what he called a \u201ctarget\u201d on his back. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to bring it every night,\u201d Gafford says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be strong every night. I\u2019ve still got some more work to do. I\u2019m not a complete player yet. But I\u2019m going to be one soon.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

He\u2019s the modern-day version of ex-Detroit Pistons great Vinnie Johnson , whose \u201cMicrowave\u201d nickname perfectly defined his role: heat up (scoring-wise) in a hurry. That, in a nutshell, describes Williams as well, especially lately. Some of his recent games have been sixth-man epic \u2014 he scorched earth on the Oklahoma City Thunder with 40 points in 34 minutes , followed that up three nights later with 34 points in just 23 minutes against the Boston Celtics when he claimed the bench scoring record from Dell Curry. He\u2019s averaging 20.3 points in 26.5 minutes per game, with eight 30-point games \u2013 six of which have come in his last 17 games. This high efficiency comes as Williams, 32, is in his 13th NBA season. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done anything that ends in \u2018ever\u2019 in the NBA, that\u2019s pretty impressive,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. How deeply does Williams identify with the sixth man? Well, Drake made Williams a legend by writing \u201c6 Man,\u201d which dropped five years ago when the player was with Drake\u2019s hometown Toronto Raptors. The catchy verse goes: \u201cLike I\u2019m Lou Will, I just got the new deal.\u201d Well, Williams got the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award in 2014-15 , the first of two for him ( he also won last season ). This all makes Williams perhaps the greatest sixth man ever, especially if he wins a third career award to tie Jamal Crawford, his mentor and friendly rival. If the purpose of the sixth man is to enter the game midway through the first quarter and make an instant scoring splash, who fits that more than Williams? But what isn\u2019t addressed the fundamental question that always get lost when debating the sixth man: If Williams is so good, why doesn\u2019t he start? This is what makes the sixth man the most confusing position in the sport \u2014 because there is no position on the floor with a more ambiguous definition. Shouldn\u2019t a \u201ctrue\u201d sixth man be someone who\u2019s more or less be more reflective of someone on the bench? Williams, however, backs up rookie Landry Shamut \u2014 who arrived at the trade deadline. Before that, Williams was backing up Avery Bradley. Neither player is on Williams\u2019 level. There\u2019s a rich history of Sixth Man Award winners who came off the bench out of preference by their coach, not because they were true bench players. The inaugural winner, Sixers legend Bobby Jones, was a far better option at small forward than starter Marc Iavaroni in 1982-83. The Boston Celtics\u2019 Kevin McHale, who won the award in \u201984 and \u201885, is a Hall of Famer and one of the best low-post players ever. Wouldn\u2019t Manu Ginobili have been just as solid a player for the San Antonio Spurs had he started instead of being a reserve? Most likely, yes. The notion of a \u201csixth man\u201d was created by legendary Celtics coach Red Auerbach . He theorized Boston had enough scorers in the starting lineup, but suffered when they rested. Hall of Famer John Havlicek filled that role to great success as teams and coaches stole Auerbach\u2019s idea. Most sixth men are scorers only and some are poor defenders. By limiting their minutes, coaches can hide their flaws. Sixth men also usually guard opposing bench players and aren\u2019t on the floor long enough to damage their own team. More than anything, great sixth men are afforded a higher status than other reserves and can compete for the Kia Sixth Man Award. It compensates for the horror of being a starter, a perk that means more to players (and their families) than you think. Aside from that introduction, sixth men and starters can be hard to tell apart. They have roughly the same level of importance and are often on the floor together late in games. Nobody comes into the NBA craving a sixth man role, and almost all of the great ones resisted the gig at first. Williams is no exception. Once he established himself as a solid player with the Sixers a decade ago, he wanted the prestige and ego-boost that came with starting. The No. 45 pick of the 2005 Draft , Williams was Allen Iverson\u2019s caddy in 2005-06. Even after Iverson was traded to Denver in 2006 , Williams remained a reserve until 2009-10, when he started 38 of the 64 games he played. He lost the starting role, though, once Iverson came back that season. After that, Williams spent much of his career off the bench and, initially, it rubbed him the wrong way.  \u201cIt took some time, it kind of took some resentment,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf you think that I got to come off the bench, then I am going to put you in a position to try to prove you wrong. Then after a while, it was kind of fun, and over the years it was my makeup.\u201d In each of his subsequent stops \u2014 the Clippers are his sixth team \u2014 Williams found peace and a unique place off the bench. It became his calling card and identity while also creating a market for him. His talent and attitude about being a sixth man makes him a major asset for the Clippers. And now, he\u2019s a part of NBA history. Arguably, that\u2019s better than being an ordinary starter. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to embrace my role and I think that is what makes it special,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat is part of my legacy as well. That is part of what people will remember me for, so you might as well be the best at that.\u201d To date, 11,172 of Williams\u2019 13,089 career points have come as a sixth man and he has started 12 percent of his career games (109 of 924). Last season, he led the NBA in fourth-quarter points (597) and ranks second this season (479) . Although he\u2019s just 6-foot-1, Williams has an ability to score almost anywhere on the floor. He isn\u2019t blessed with alien speed or quickness. But his instincts and crafty ability to create space places him in a class with few others. \u201cI\u2019m just a baller,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis is something I love to do and was probably born to do. In the summertime you\u2019ll find me back home in Atlanta, in the gym playing against whoever walks in that day.\u201d You want to make Williams laugh? Ask him if he subs in during those summer pick-up games. Even the greatest scoring sixth man in NBA history has his limits. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It also means his impressive run of top-five finishes in the MVP chase is likely to meet an ugly demise this season, too. He finished ninth in MVP voting his rookie season (2002-03) and sixth the following season before making the top five in every season since then \u2026 (likely) until now. It\u2019s not that he hasn\u2019t posted MVP-caliber numbers \u2014 his 27.4 points, 8.6 rebounds and eight assists per game are better than his career stats (27.2 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 7.2 apg). Individual metrics aren\u2019t the problem, but rather the Lakers\u2019 futility this season \u2014 fueled in large part by his career-high 18-games missed due to injury and\/or maintenance \u2014 is what will cost him his customary spot on most MVP ballots. \u201cObviously, I would love for the team to be in the postseason,\u201d James said after the Lakers\u2019 123-107 win Tuesday in Chic ago. \u201cEven if I\u2019m not a part of it, the postseason I\u2019ve always loved. But right now, it\u2019s not the hand I was dealt, so you play the hand that you were dealt until the dealer shuffles the cards and you\u2019re dealt another hand and can do that.\u201d LeBron\u2019s \u201cfanboys\u201d (as Kevin Durant calls them) will argue that James\u2019 unavailability during that critical stretch of the season is what caused the Lakers to slide out of the playoff chase. That\u2019s a theory no doubt rooted in some truth. But that won\u2019t be enough to sustain his run of seasons inside the MVP velvet rope that he\u2019s enjoyed for so long. It is odd for this to happen in the same season that LeBron passes his idol, Michael Jordan , for fourth on the all-time scoring list. And to be fair, he\u2019s still got a few weeks left to present his final argument that he hasn\u2019t given any ground in terms of his own individual performance. That\u2019s not how this works, of course. The MVP conversation begins with individual brilliance but must be buttressed by team success and league-wide relevance. No one knows that better than LeBron. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  Tied for No. 1 Season stats:  27.0 points, 12.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.3 blocks No one has been able to disrupt Antetokounmpo\u2019s flow this season, no matter what tactics they\u2019ve employed to stymie Milwaukee\u2019s anchor and superstar. His ability to counter basically every team\u2019s defensive look bodes well for his effectiveness in the playoffs. The notion that daring him to shoot and preventing him from attacking the rim would somehow force him to abandon his biggest strengths ignored the fact that his \u201cGreek Freak\u201d nickname is a most appropriate moniker. The Miami Heat will get a reminder tonight when they host the Bucks at American Airlines Arena ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). Sunday\u2019s dance with the Philadelphia 76ers ( 3:30 ET, ABC ), however, offers one of the few chances when Antetokounmpo might not be the freakiest physical specimen on the floor. The Sixers\u2019 Joel Embiid made an emphatic return from some post All-Star break load management to drill the Indiana Pacers for 33 points and 12 rebounds last Sunday , then dropped 17 points, 19 rebounds, five assists and four blocks on the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday . Antetokounmpo and Embiid will face each other for just the fourth time in their careers. Last week:  Tied for No. 1 Season stats :  36.0 points, 7.5 assists, 6.5 rebounds, 2.2 steals Harden didn\u2019t seem particularly stressed after the Rockets saw their nine-game win streak come to an end Wednesday against the Golden State Warriors . Harden knows, as we all do, that nothing that happens during the season has any impact on what could happen should the teams meet again come playoff time. In winning the season series 3-1, Harden and Co. have already made their point where the Warriors are concerned. The Rockets are the one team capable of pushing them to the limit, as they did in the 2018 Western Conference finals . Harden knows that the Rockets need a healthy roster with the postseason on the horizon. Losing Chris Paul to a hamstring injury for the final two games of last season\u2019s series vs. the Warriors proved crucial. The more important business now for Harden and the Rockets is continuing their climb in the Western Conference standings. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.2 points 8.1 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 2.2 steals George and the Thunder are battling for a coveted top-three spot in the Western Conference playoff chase. Who knew that George\u2019s absence with a sore shoulder would impact his team the way it did? But as good as Russell Westbrook has been this season \u2014 and he\u2019s been fantastic at times \u2014 not having George in the mix those three games wobbled the Thunder. They\u2019ve lost seven of their 12 games since the All-Star break, including a spirit-crunching road loss to the Indiana Pacers last night . In just his second visit to Indiana since he was traded to the Thunder two years ago, George lit his former team up for 36 points, six rebounds, five assists and two steals as they raced out to a 19-point lead. But it wasn\u2019t enough to survive the Pacers\u2019 rally and a Wesley Matthews tip-in with 1.8 seconds to play . It was another one of those nights when George and Westbrook did their thing, but the rest of the roster\u2019s offensive production wasn\u2019t up to the task. Saturday\u2019s showdown with the Warriors ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC ), however, offers a chance for redemption and would be just the spark the Thunder need to crank things up as the playoff positioning continues. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  27.9 points, 5.3 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.3 steals Curry has the luxury playing on a team so star-studded that a pedestrian performance \u2014 by his lofty standards, anyway \u2014 in a showdown game doesn\u2019t rattle anyone. He shot a rough 8-for-20 (3-for-9 from deep) in Wednesday\u2019s showdown with the Rockets , a game that Kevin Durant (ankle) missed . But when Klay Thompson (30 points) and DeMarcus Cousins (27 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, two steals) go nuclear, Curry gets the kind of cover he often provides others. Another statement game awaits, though, in Saturday\u2019s game in Oklahoma City ( 8:30 ET, ABC ). That will feature a hungry Thunder team, an anxious home crowd seeking another shot at the defending champs and the always-ready Russell Westbrook. The Warriors are 1-0 on their current road trip that makes stops in San Antonio (Monday) and Minnesota (Tuesday) before they return to home for three straight games. Seeing Curry and the Warriors eyeball the upcoming schedule is something new, given the way they\u2019ve dominated the West the past five seasons. But they are locked in a race for the top seed and have had to adjust accordingly. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  20.2 points, 10.8 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 1.4 steals Jokic\u2019s late-game heroics helped the Nuggets survive Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks Thursday night \u2026 and also helped salvage what could have been a rough week, too. Last Saturday, Denver got smashed in the face by Golden State, the team it is chasing for West\u2019s top spot, but has gone 2-0 since then. While Jokic hasn\u2019t scored more than 18 points in four straight games, he\u2019s made up for it with his playmaking\/facilitating during that same stretch. But the Nuggets need more from their star big man if they are serious about passing the Warriors, who were more than up for last Saturday\u2019s challenge. Coach Mike Malone has done a splendid job massaging his rotation, keeping Denver locked in and focused on the tasks at hand. Jokic\u2019s constantly stellar effort this season has been perhaps the biggest factor in that success, which might land him an All-NBA first team spot in the months to come. * * * 6.

On Thursday in Denver, the next generation lit the torch and carried it to a thrilling finish. Luka Doncic, the Slovenian wunderkind whose highlights never cease, added another clip to his reel with a ferocious, one-handed slam that put Dallas up by one on the Nuggets with 5.8 seconds remaining. Then, Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets\u2019 own European-born star, responded with a bit of high-post wizardry. The newly minted All-Star drove right and threw up a leaning, right-handed push shot that somehow evaded airtight defense and hit nothing but net, handing Denver the 100-99 victory . More on Jokic\u2019s buzzer-beater in a minute. For now, bask in an NBA that very nearly saw two young European stars log triple-doubles on the same night. Jokic (11 points, 14 rebounds, eight assists) and Doncic (24 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists) will be league headliners for a long, long time. As always, we rate game-winning buzzer-beaters on our Horry Scale. Reminder: The Horry Scale breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. DIFFICULTY: Jokic averages just 2.3 of his 20.1 points per game on drives, per NBA Stats. It\u2019s not his go-to move, but the Serbian big man didn\u2019t hesitate to put the ball on the floor. He had the patience to stop, fake-pivot back and then forward again in a last-ditch effort to lose his defender. Dwight Powell stayed with Jokic, forcing him into an awkward release while fading to his right. There was a good amount of contact on the play, but that didn\u2019t stop Jokic from muscling the shot directly on target. Not easy by anyone, but especially a big man unused to such off-the-dribble improv. GAME SITUATION:  Denver trailed by as many as 12 early in the fourth quarter, and that was the second comeback they were forced to make after erasing an eight-point hole in the first half. Dallas, all but assured of missing the playoffs, would have gained little from the win. Yet Denver remains just a game back of Golden State for the No. 1 seed in the West. The Nuggets wanted \u2014 and might wind up needing \u2014 this win. CELEBRATION: Neither Jokic nor his teammates went over the top in their post-win euphoria. They simply surrounded their monolithic big man with hugs and head pats that seemed to confirm he\u2019s the guy who will lead them forward, both this season and in the future. Jokic took it all in happy stride, giving off a very \u201cI\u2019ve-been-here-before\u201d vibe for someone who had just hit his first NBA game-winning buzzer beater. GRADE: The outcome mattered to Denver far more than it did to Dallas, but the Nuggets now approach the postseason with a fresh example of their best player\u2019s ability to step up in big moments. Just as compelling were the characters in the finals scene: two up-and-coming NBA stars from Slovenia and Serbia, respectively. The NBA has come a long way. 4 1\/2 Horrys . For Indiana, Wesley Matthews wasn\u2019t a buyout luxury. The Pacers, intent on remaining among the East\u2019s upper crust even without All-Star Victor Oladipo (ruptured quad), badly needed Matthews. The 32-year-old fit their mold of hard-working, switchable defenders capable of doing more than just one thing on offense. That extra thing isn\u2019t usually an offensive put-back with time running out, but that\u2019s what Matthews did to secure an enormous victory against Oklahoma City on Thursday night. The play capped off a 19-point second-half comeback despite Indiana boasting neither of the two best players in the game. Russell Westbrook\u2019s triple-double and Paul George\u2019s 36 points weren\u2019t enough against a Pacers lineup that is coming into its own. Matthews is part of that quintet, one that coach Nate McMillan has only begun to use, playing Oladipo\u2019s nominal two-guard position, an injury-carved gap Indiana tried to fill with everyone from Tyreke Evans (can\u2019t shoot), Cory Joseph (too small) and even Edmond Sumner (too green). Matthews (6-foot-5 and a 37-percent shooter from 3) single-handedly negates any of those weaknesses. With 6:25 remaining, McMillan sent Matthews \u2014 along with Myles Turner and Bojan Bogdanovic \u2014 back into the game to join Domantas Sabonis and Darren Collison. It\u2019s a group that, entering Thursday, had only played 14 minutes together. In that time, they were a plus-13. Over the final six-plus minutes, that same five-man crew outscored the star-studded Thunder, 23-10. Matthews scored eight points in that stretch, including a pair of 3s to go with the game-winner. Sabonis is the other driving force behind Indiana\u2019s Oladipo-less overachievement. He is too often forgotten in the Kia Sixth Man of the Year discussions, which revolve around the pair of bench beasts fueling the Clippers\u2019 own unlikely playoff push (Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell). The other half of the Paul George trade is averaging 14.1 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists in fewer than 25 minutes per game. Thaddeus Young, whose minutes are most affected by Sabonis, might have made the (other) play of the night when he told McMillan to keep him on the bench in favor of Sabonis. McMillan may be forced to make that call more often, especially with a group that doubled its plus-minus in less than seven minutes of action. Oh, and those pesky Pacers? They\u2019re back at third place in the East. Whether the Celtics are \u201cback\u201d or not, there is no arguing that Kyrie Irving is enjoying the best year of his career. That\u2019s a big deal for a six-time All-Star who mysteriously boasts just one All-NBA honor (2014-15 Third Team) on his resume. Another may be forthcoming. Irving\u2019s second career triple-double, which came against the Kings (31 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds), marked the sixth time this season he has logged at least 30 points and 10 assists in a game. He owned just five such nights over his previous seven seasons combined. The Mavericks\u2019 living legend broke the mold for the \u201cstretch\u201d era of NBA big men. He\u2019s not afraid to say as much to his younger teammates, either. A few minutes into the first quarter, Nowitzki showed exactly why he can brag on himself whenever he darn well pleases."},{"id":34951,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/klay-thompson-apologies-warriors-fans","date":"2019-03-14","title":"Thompson apologizes to Warriors fans","content":" Klay Thompson, after calling out the Sunday crowd who watched on as the Golden State Warriors lost to the lowly Phoenix Suns for the first time in 18 matchups, tweeted out an apology Wednesday afternoon.

The postseason will ultimately decide the winners and losers from the deadline. It\u2019s still early with most of these new faces in new places, and a couple of good or bad games could skew the numbers of a player that\u2019s only played a dozen games with a team. But there\u2019s something to learn from every game on the schedule. And the playoffs are now less than a month away. With no major conclusions to draw just yet, here are some early returns on some late-season additions to teams (in both the East and West) that will be competing in the postseason (and one that will likely come up short in its quest to end the league\u2019s longest current playoff drought). Let\u2019s take a closer look: East trades | West trades * * * * * *  Since joining the team that averages the second most 3-point attempts per game, Nikola Mirotic has attempted the most 3-pointers per 36 minutes (10.2). Though he hasn\u2019t been super hot (his effective field goal percentage of 54.2 percent with the Bucks is a little above the league average), the Bucks have scored an efficient 115.3 points per 100 possessions in Mirotic\u2019s 243 minutes on the floor. But interestingly, Mirotic has played just 88 minutes alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo . The new Buck is seemingly a great complement to the Kia MVP candidate, but the two have played less than nine minutes per game together, with Mirotic more often playing alongside Khris Middleton. And really, everybody else in the rotation is a great complement to Antetokounmpo. Pau Gasol is, seemingly, not in the rotation. He left San Antonio because he was the Spurs\u2019 third-string center, but it\u2019s not clear he\u2019ll have a bigger role in Milwaukee. He\u2019s been DNP\u2019d in two of the last three games, and in San Antonio on Sunday, he was a minus-20 in less than 15 minutes of a game that the Bucks lost by seven .  The Toronto bench hasn\u2019t been nearly as good as it was a year ago, and the two late-season additions haven\u2019t helped it much. Marc Gasol and Jeremy Lin have shot a combined 8-for-42 (19 percent) from 3-point range with their new team, and in their 100 minutes on the floor together, the Raptors have been outscored by 13 points per 100 possessions . The Raptors miss Fred VanVleet, who has been out five weeks with a wrist injury. Last season\u2019s third place finisher in Kia Sixth Man of the Year voting has the best on-court numbers among Toronto\u2019s regular reserves , but has played just one game with Gasol and has yet to play alongside Lin. Gasol has started five games with Toronto, and the Raptors have outscored their opponents by 11 points per 100 possessions in his 62 total minutes with him on the floor alongside their other four starters. With Serge Ibaka suspended for the next three games, that lineup will get some more burn (though Kawhi Leonard will surely sit out at least one of the three). As expected, Gasol has given the Raptors\u2019 ball movement a boost. They\u2019ve assisted on 65 percent of their buckets over Gasol\u2019s 12 games. That\u2019s the fifth-highest rate in the league over that stretch and up from 58 percent ( 22nd ) prior to his addition. They\u2019ve assisted on more than 72 percent of their buckets with Gasol and Kyle Lowry on the floor together . In his eighth season in the league, Tobias Harris is registering career highs in both effective field goal percentage (56.6 percent) and true shooting percentage (60.7 percent). And both of those numbers have been higher in his 14 games with the Sixers than they were in his 55 games with the Clippers. Harris has been the Sixers\u2019 second-leading scorer (19.9 points per game) since arriving via a Feb. 6 trade. Because Joel Embiid missed the first eight games after the All-Star break, the Sixers\u2019 new starting lineup has played just 83 minutes in five games together . The numbers in those minutes (plus-24.0 points per 100 possessions) have been ridiculously good, but they include 20 minutes in New York in which the Sixers outscored the Knicks by 23 points. Even when the five starters are healthy, Harris will play more minutes in other lineups than he does with that starting group, because Brett Brown staggers his starters more than any other coach, keeping two on the floor at all time. Harris has played most with Ben Simmons , and the Sixers have been outscored by 4.4 points per 100 possessions in 301 minutes with Harris and Simmons on the floor without Embiid. The Sixers have upgraded the talent around him, but Embiid remains the difference maker in Philly.  Of all the late-season additions listed here, Matthews seemed to fill the biggest hole in a team\u2019s rotation. After Victor Oladipo was lost for the season, the Pacers started either the Cory Joseph (who\u2019s 6-foot-3) or Tyreke Evans (who\u2019s had a disappointing season) at shooting guard. Matthews made six 3-pointers and scored 24 points in his third game with Indiana. Having made 38 percent of his team-leading 77 shots from beyond the arc, he\u2019s helped the Pacers remain in the top five in 3-point percentage . But the Pacers\u2019 new starting lineup ( plus-2.0 points per 100 possessions in 192 minutes ) hasn\u2019t been as good as any of the other versions (with Oladipo, Evans or Joseph at the two), even though it has played six of its 10 games against teams with losing records. And the schedule is about to get much tougher, with the Pacers set to play 12 of their next 13 games against teams with winning records. The Matthews addition has put Joseph and Evans back in their bench roles, and the Pacers have outscored their opponents by 9.0 points per 100 possessions in 566 minutes with the two reserve guards on the floor with Sixth Man of the Year candidate Domantas Sabonis. * * * The Western Conference wasn\u2019t as busy as the East at the deadline, but in the last two months, two former All-Stars made their debuts with the two teams atop the standings. * * * In the eight weeks since he made his season debut, the Warriors have been better with DeMarcus Cousins off the floor ( plus-8.7 points per 100 possessions ) than they\u2019ve been with him on the floor (plus-0.3). The bigger difference in those numbers has been on offense, though the issue with the Warriors\u2019 new starting lineup has been on the other side of the ball. In its 179 minutes together, the Warriors\u2019 five-star lineup has scored 113.3 points per 100 possessions and allowed 111.1, making it the worst defensive lineup of their six that have played at least 75 minutes together . Cousins has had issues defending in space and that lineup has allowed opponents to make 11.1 3-pointers per 36 minutes, most among the 55 league-wide lineups that have played at least 150 minutes together (the league average is 8.4 threes per 36). In 115 minutes with the other four starters on the court without Cousins over the last eight weeks, the Warriors have been better defensively and much better offensively, outscoring their opponents by 18.4 points per 100 possessions . Andre Iguodala has been the fifth guy on the floor for most of those minutes and has been on the floor for almost twice as many \u201cclutch\u201d minutes as Cousins over the last eight weeks. Down the stretch of close games, Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been more likely to turn to his small-ball lineup, which has outscored its opponents by 22.7 points per 100 possessions, the second-best mark among those 55 lineups that have played at least 150 minutes. But Cousins had his best game as a Warrior on Wednesday, registering 27 points (on 11-for-16 shooting), eight rebounds and seven assists as the champs held off the Rockets in Houston . He was a plus-7 in a two-point victory. Kevin Durant didn\u2019t play on Wednesday, and it may be that Cousins is most valuable in minutes when the Warriors don\u2019t have all three of their leading scorers \u2014 Stephen Curry, Durant and Klay Thompson \u2014 on the floor, though he hasn\u2019t disrupted the offense when he\u2019s been out there with all three. In fact, the Warriors\u2019 starting lineup has assisted on 79.5 percent of its field goals, by far the highest rate among lineups that have played at least 150 minutes together. As he showed on Wednesday, Cousins has the ability to be a difference-maker on any given night. And the great thing for the Warriors is that they have other options when they need them.  The Nuggets signed Isaiah Thomas last summer knowing that he\u2019d miss most of the season as he recovered from hip surgery. What they didn\u2019t necessarily know was that, before Thomas could make his season debut on Feb. 13 , Malik Beasley (who wasn\u2019t able to stick in the rotation in his first two seasons) and Monte Morris (who played 25 minutes as a rookie) would establish themselves as reliable reserve guards worthy of playing time ahead of the guy who finished fifth in Kia MVP voting in 2016-17. Nuggets coach Michael Malone gave Thomas a nine-game audition off the Nuggets\u2019 bench (playing five guards in their first eight post-All-Star break games), and the results weren\u2019t great. Thomas shot 37 percent and the Nuggets scored just an anemic 96.2 points per 100 possessions in his 140 minutes on the floor. He had a higher free throw rate (25 attempts per 100 shots from the field) than any of the other Denver guards, but that\u2019s probably not enough to make up for his sub-par shooting and defense. Thomas didn\u2019t play against Minnesota on Tuesday and Malone said that he\u2019d play a shorter rotation \u201cfor the time being.\u201d Assuming the Nuggets stay healthy, Thomas will likely go into another offseason having yet to reestablish himself as an impact player.  When Jerami Grant missed the Thunder\u2019s last two games before the All-Star break, Patrick Patterson started in Grant\u2019s place and shot 2-for-13 (including 0-for-8 from 3-point range) over the two games. Even if the Thunder were healthy, there was a clear need for Markieff Morris to replace Patterson (who\u2019s had a mostly disappointing two seasons in Oklahoma City) in the Thunder rotation. Morris has shot just 39 percent with the Thunder, who have scored just 103.6 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor. But the defensive numbers have been good enough that the offense hasn\u2019t hurt them too badly. And the emergence of Grant as a much more productive offensive player than he was last season lessens the need for Morris\u2019 offense. Grant has shot 38 percent on 212 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts this season , up from 29 percent on just 102 attempts last season. The issue is that Morris\u2019 neck was hurting enough that he missed the Thunder\u2019s win over Brooklyn on Wednesday. As noted last week , the Blazers have been playing Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum more minutes together and (typically) starting the second and fourth quarters with both on the bench. That has put additional stress on the Portland reserves, which, for the most part, haven\u2019t performed well in those minutes with both starting guards off the floor. In 462 minutes with Evan Turner on the floor without either Lillard or McCollum, the Blazers have been outscored by 7.2 points per 100 possessions . So the Blazers (seemingly) addressed a need by trading for Rodney Hood at the deadline and adding Enes Kanter (via the buyout market) at the All-Star break. In his first two games with the Blazers, Kanter totaled 34 points and 17 rebounds in just 41 minutes. Later in the Blazers\u2019 seven-game road trip, Hood scored 27 points (all in the second half) off the bench in a 10-point win in Charlotte . But in 132 minutes with both Hood and Kanter on the floor so far, the Blazers have been outscored by 14.9 points per 100 possessions , with dreadful numbers (92.4 points scored per 100) on offense. In their overtime loss to the Thunder last week, the Blazers were outscored by 14 points (and shot just 9-for-30 from the field) in a little more than 18 minutes with both Hood and Kanter on the floor. Kanter has registered a negative plus-minus in eight of his nine games with the Blazers , with a game against the Phoenix Suns being the lone exception.  Prior to trading Tobias Harris, despite strong seasons from both Harris and Danilo Gallinari, the Clippers never had a starting lineup that worked. They were outscored by 6.0 points per 100 possessions in 674 total minutes with any five of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Patrick Beverley, Avery Bradley, Harris, Gallinari and Marcin Gortat \u2014 the six Clippers that have started the most games \u2014 on the floor. But after Landry Shamet shot 7-for-12 from 3-point range in his first two games off the Clippers\u2019 bench , coach Doc Rivers settled on a new starting lineup of Gilgeous-Alexander, Beverley, Shamet, Gallinari and Ivica Zubac. And that lineup has outscored its opponents by 13.2 points per 100 possessions in its 142 minutes together. The Clippers have also outscored their opponents by 4.6 points per 100 possessions in 138 minutes with their four main reserves \u2014 Lou Williams, Garrett Temple, JaMychal and Montrezl Harrell \u2014 on the floor together. After the Harris deal, the Clippers acquired two rotation players (Temple and Green) for one (Bradley). They traded two starters and waived a third (Gortat), but improved their depth and discovered a functioning starting lineup to boot. Prior to losing to Portland on Tuesday (with Gallinari getting the night off), the Clippers had won five straight games. It was, statistically, their best five-game stretch ( plus-13.0 per 100 possessions ) of the season and it briefly pushed them into sixth place in the West. The Clippers have big plans for the summer, but they\u2019re also set to give the Staples Center some playoff games next month. All because they\u2019ve played better after trading Harris than they did before. The Clippers\u2019 surge (along with one of their wins on that five-game winning streak) has been at the expense of the Sacramento Kings, who are 4 1\/2 games out of a playoff spot entering a tough, Thursday-Friday back-to-back in Boston and Philadelphia. Even if they don\u2019t end their 12-year playoff drought, the Kings have had a transformational season. They\u2019ve found an identity and have a talented young core to develop. But their attempt to accelerate their timeline, trading Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph for Harrison Barnes, hasn\u2019t made much of an impact. Over the 12 games that he\u2019s played with the Kings, Barnes ranks seventh on the team in usage rate and has a true shooting percentage (54.2 percent) below the league average (55.9 percent). The Kings\u2019 new starting lineup has been worse than their previous two starting lineups (with either Iman Shumpert or Bogdan Bogdanovic at small forward), getting outscored by 2.7 points per 100 possessions in its 148 minutes. The Kings won their first two games with Barnes, but have since lost seven of 10, with the league\u2019s 27th-ranked offense over that stretch. Five of those last 10 games have come against the league\u2019s top 10 teams (including three of them against the top four), but the Kings have scored less than a point per possession with Barnes on the floor in his other seven games with the team. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Boy, did that get your attention. I received more emails and comments this week than all season combined. For the record, I\u2019m not losing my mind. (But would I know it if I was?) Young deserved the nod, and I stand behind it. And as a reminder: the Kia Rookie Ladder takes into account the season on the whole, with extra weight given to recent performance. Young was on a tear, and he earned the rung. Am I saying he\u2019s the Kia Rookie of the Year? Absolutely not. I\u2019ll make that decision at the end of the season. But for one week, at least, Young deserved the top spot. Of course, right after I swapped them, Young went 6-for-28 from the field (2-for-8) in his next two games. And this is where it gets tricky writing this column every week. Doncic didn\u2019t have a spectacular week, either. Which leaves me with a tough decision to make. Check out their numbers this week in three games each: For now, Young keeps the top spot, based mostly on Doncic\u2019s most recent two games \u2014 which saw him go 10-for-34 from the field (2-for-13 on 3-pointers). Doncic, who remains the frontrunner for ROY based off the season on a whole, had one of his worst games of the season Tuesday, scoring 12 points while committing nine turnovers (the second time in the last three weeks he\u2019s had that many) in a 112-105 loss to the Spurs . Young had struggles of his own, but he picked up his first triple-double and led the Hawks to two wins to barely \u2014 just barely \u2014 hold off Doncic. * * * Last week:  No. 1 Young had the first triple-double by a rookie in Hawks history Saturday, which was one of the highlights of his week. But to be fair to what I said above about Doncic\u2019s clunker, Young also had a dud of a game this week, going 2-for-14 from the field (0-for-4 on 3-pointers) against the New Orleans Pelicans . However, Young also had 10 assists (five in the fourth quarter) and helped facilitate a 128-116 win when his shot wasn\u2019t falling (he missed his first nine attempts). Coach Lloyd Pierce was impressed by Young\u2019s ability to handle the rough shooting night. \u201dHe came in the fourth quarter and played 12 straight minutes and shifted to just a playmaker,\u201d Pierce said. \u201dI think it\u2019s a sign of maturity. I think he\u2019s going to have those games from time to time and understand he can still impact a game.\u201d Last week:  No. 2 To Doncic\u2019s credit, the rookie wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d play in the embarrassing loss to the Spurs, in which he went 1-for-9 from the free throw line . \u201cJust in my head, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to miss it. I\u2019ve just got to work on that. I\u2019ve got to think I\u2019m going to make every shot.\u201d Doncic had suffered a knee strain against the Rockets, but fought through the injury, which is admirable considering the Mavs\u2019 position in the standings. \u201cHonestly I wasn\u2019t 100 percent, but I want to play. I want to play always. Even though we\u2019re not playing for that much right now I just want to play every game.\u201d You\u2019ve got to love the attitude. 3. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers  Last week:  Not ranked Sexton has had his ups and downs this season, but he said this week \u201cthe game is starting to slow down a little bit.\u201d And it shows. In three games this week, the point guard averaged 27 points on 58.2 percent shooting, hitting 57.9 percent of his 3-pointers. Sexton was huge in the Cavs\u2019 surprise win vs. Toronto , scoring 28 points with four rebounds, five assists and zero turnovers. He was 10-for-18 from the field, and afterward coach Larry Drew said it might have been his best game of the season. \u201cI really thought tonight was probably as complete of a game as I\u2019ve seen Collin play in regards to him scoring, getting us into an offense and his decision-making. \u2026 He played a terrific all-around game.\u201d A night later, he nearly willed the Cavs to a win in Philly, scoring 26 points on 11-for-20 shooting. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s becoming more confident running the team and finding his scoring spots. 4. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns  Last week:  No. 3 Ayton was crucial to the Suns\u2019 surprising upset of the Golden State Warriors on Sunday , scoring 18 points and grabbing nine rebounds in the 115-111 win. But Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Utah Jazz was a different story. Going against Rudy Gobert, Ayton finished with two points on 1-for-9 shooting in 32 ineffective minutes. Ayton didn\u2019t hold back on his performance. \u201cOverall, I give myself an F-minus,\u201d Ayton told reporters . \u201cThis was a bad game. I definitely put this loss on me. I just wasn\u2019t locked in. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. The shots I took were pretty bad. This is definitely the worst game I\u2019ve ever played.\u201d  Last week:  No. 4 Shamet is going to play a big role in the Clippers\u2019 run toward the playoffs. He\u2019s getting 28.5 minutes per game in L.A. (he got 20.5 mpg with the Sixers ), averaging 12.1 points on 44.1 percent shooting. He\u2019s knocking down 46.9 percent of his 3-pointers with the Clippers, easily leading rookies in 3-point shooting on the season. If you haven\u2019t seen a Clippers game yet, Shamet is worth checking out. His ability to come off screens and get his shot off quickly is a thing of beauty. Just missed the cut:  Jalen Brunson, Dallas Mavericks Brunson has scored in double figures in five straight and had his best game in the Mavs\u2019 loss to the Spurs. The second-round pick scored 34 points and averaged 23.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg and 5.7 apg while shooting 65 percent overall (and 41.7 percent on 3-pointers) this week. \u201cHe\u2019s probably grown more than any player,\u201d Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cIf you go back to the Summer League in July, if you\u2019d seen him play then and you saw him play tonight, you\u2019d say \u2018Wow.\u2019 \u201d Kevin Huerter, Atlanta Hawks The young sharpshooter scored 27 in the Hawks\u2019 128-116 win over the Pelicans on Sunday, going 11-for-18 from the field (4-for-7 on 3-pointers). On a night Young struggled to find his shot, Huerter was needed and the Hawks kept looking for their other rookie. \u201dMy teammates started finding me,\u201d Huerter said. \u201dThey started running plays for me almost every possession down the court.\u201d Huerter followed that up with 16 points, five rebounds and four assists in Wednesday\u2019s win against Memphis . Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 12 ppg in three games and was his consistent self from the field, shooting 52 percent overall (and 3-for-4 on 3-pointers). He helped L.A. get wins against the Oklahoma City Thunder and Boston Celtics before seeing their five-game win streak end Tuesday against Portland . The Clippers are winning while starting two rookies, so if watching rookies is your thing, they might be worth adopting down the stretch and into the playoffs. Frank Jackson, New Orleans Pelicans Jackson has been mentioned in this space a few times this season, but he\u2019s really blossomed over the last few weeks. He\u2019s scored in double digits in six of his last eight games and averaged 19 ppg and 46.4 percent shooting in his last three games while filling in for Jrue Holiday. \u201cI think with him, it\u2019s all about confidence,\u201d coach Alvin Gentry said of Jackson\u2019s improvement . \u201cI think the more he plays, the more confidence he gets. The big thing for me is that he\u2019s not duplicating mistakes. You tell him something and then he takes that out of his game and tries to take a step forward. That\u2019s the big thing.\u201d * * * (All stats through Wednesday, March 13) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Kristaps Porzingis, whom the Mavs acquired in a blockbuster trade with the New York Knicks in early February, went through his first five-on-five practice. Porzingis has not been on the court in 13 months, when he suffered a torn left ACL in a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Feb. 6, 2018 (while he was still with the Knicks). Wednesday marked Porzingis\u2019 first full-scale practice since his ACL surgery and said overall he felt fantastic after the practice, per Dwain Price of Mavs.com . \u201cThat\u2019s not how we planned it,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the progression that we had. I could have been on the court way earlier than this. \u201cBut we really took our time, we really stayed patient, I stayed really patient. I\u2019m proud of myself for staying that patient. But now it\u2019s here, I\u2019m excited and I can\u2019t wait for the next practice.\u201d The Mavs had hopes of making a playoff run this season after a 15-11 start. Since then, though, the team has faltered greatly and enters tonight\u2019s road game against the Denver Nuggets ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) at 27-40 and in 14th place in the Western Conference . Practically from the date Dallas acquired Porzingis, there has been no talk of him suiting up this season . His participation in practice, however, gives Dallas hope for a future built around Porzingis, star rookie Luka Doncic and whomever the team adds this summer via trades, free agency and the Draft. Coach Rick Carlisle told Mavs.com he can\u2019t help but think about the ways a healthy Porzingis could help the Mavs next season. \u201cHe went through a full practice with no issues, so very encouraging,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s made tremendous progress with his rehab, with his conditioning, his strength, and (playing 5-on-5 basketball) was the next logical progression. \u201cHe played 3-on-3 yesterday morning with some of the other guys and did extremely well there. So this went really well.\u201d For Porzingis, just getting back on the court and reaching a goal he had in mind for himself is a measure of success. \u201cI\u2019ve visualized a lot and I see myself playing, so this whole time I\u2019m always thinking in my head \u2018I don\u2019t want to come back and be rusty,\u2019 \u201c Porzingis said. \u201cI want to be in the game right away. \u201cI missed the shots today, but I felt good on the court, I felt comfortable, I felt fluid and I think that\u2019s important. The shots will start falling and the more we play, the more I play. It\u2019s good to finally be able to do something physical, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d Porzingis, who will become a restricted free agent this summer, reportedly plans to sign the qualifying offer with Dallas, which would set the stage for him to become an unrestricted free agent in 2020. The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, Porzings was named an All-Star in 2017-18, but his ACL injury occurred days after that and he never got to play in that game. The 7-foot-3 Porzingis, who was the No. 4 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, averaged 17.8 points and 7.1 rebounds in 2017-18 with the Knicks. He was expected to be the Knicks\u2019 franchise player for years. But they declined to give him a contract extension before this season \u2013 they say he was in agreement with that decision \u2013 and traded him, Tim Hardaway Jr., Trey Burke and Courtney Lee to the Mavs on February 1.

And they did so without Kevin Durant, who sat out due to a right ankle bruise. Klay Thompson led the way with 30 points, while Stephen Curry added 24 points. The Splash Brothers went 8-of-19 from beyond the arc. But the biggest factor in the Warriors\u2019 statement win was DeMarcus Cousins, who stuffed the stat sheet with a season-high 27 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Cousins made 11 of 16 shots and dominated the paint, especially when the Rockets switched on defense and left smaller players attempting to guard him. Big or small, Cousins didn\u2019t care whose man was on him. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can stop me 1-on-1, period,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can put whoever you want on me, honestly.\u201d Asked about Cousins\u2019 performance, coach Steve Kerr credited a new rotation that allowed Cousins to get more space in the paint. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to remind ourselves that it\u2019s still pretty early in the process,\u201d Kerr told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many games he\u2019s played for us \u2014 20? We\u2019re all learning, me too. I\u2019ve got to learn how to use him better. I thought we used him better tonight. I thought he did a phenomenal job of getting down on the block and controlling the game down there.\u201d The Warriors, who lost their previous three meetings with the Rockets, avoided their first regular-season sweep since losing four games to the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. No word yet if Durant will be available when the Warriors visit Oklahoma City on Saturday. Russell Westbrook continued his offensive resurgence in Oklahoma City\u2019s 108-96 comeback victory over Brooklyn. The Nets led by 10 points at halftime before Westbrook imposed his will, finishing with 31 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for the 130th triple-double of his career. \u201cIt starts with me,\u201d Westbrook said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to bring the energy every night. It was my fault in the first half and I thought we did a good job of picking up in the second half.\u201d Westbrook capped a 21-4 run in the fourth quarter by drilling a wide-open 3-pointer off a loose ball scramble, after which he danced to midcourt, pounded his chest and screamed in celebration. In a game with playoff implications for both teams, the Miami Heat opened the second half on a 21-0 run and never looked back in a 108-74 win over the Detroit Pistons. It was the biggest unanswered-point run and largest victory margin of the season for Miami, which is trying to hang on to the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference playoff race. During the 21-0 blitz, the Heat shot 6-of-10 from the floor, 2-of-2 from beyond the arc and 7-of-8 from the free-throw line. Meanwhile, the Pistons missed their first 11 shots of the third quarter, eight of them from 3-point range. Detroit\u2019s first points of third quarter came at 5:27 in the period with Blake Griffin at the line. The win moved the Heat within two games of Detroit for the No. 7 seed and built a two-game cushion on the Magic and Hornets, who are tied for ninth. Hawks\u2019 dynamic duo strikes again  John Collins and Trae Young have become a lethal combination in the Hawks\u2019 fast-paced offense. And they didn\u2019t slow down against Memphis, the NBA\u2019s defensive scoring leader. Collins had 27 points and 12 rebounds, while Young added 22 points in Atlanta\u2019s 132-111 victory over the Grizzlies. It marked the most points that Memphis has allowed this season. Nearly one-third of Collins\u2019 field goals have been assisted by Young this season, including 15 alley-oops \u2014 and perhaps none more spectacular than this connection from beyond midcourt. In between free throws, Joakim Noah was caught on camera either flirting with somebody in the stands or getting inside the head of Alex Len, who sent him to the line with a hard foul. Klay Thompson joined Stephen Curry as the only players in NBA history to record seven-straight seasons with at least 200 3-point field goals made."},{"id":46504,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-isaiah-thomas-pulled-rotation","date":"2019-03-14","title":"Reports: Nuggets pull Isaiah Thomas from rotation","content":" After a delayed start to his inaugural campaign with the Nuggets, guard Isaiah Thomas might be set for an early finish. Reports out of Denver confirm that coach Michael Malone intends to shorten his rotation for the stretch run, and Thomas didn\u2019t play in Tuesday\u2019s 133-107 victory against the Timberwolves. \u201cDefinitely talked to him,\u201d Malone told reporters after the game. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that conversation between I.T. and myself,\u201d Malone said. \u201cNot an easy conversation, but that\u2019s my job. \u2026 Isaiah is a pro and was into the game, supporting his teammates.\u201d Per Sean Keeler of the Denver Post , Malone \u2014 who previously coached Thomas when both were in Sacramento \u2014 indicated it had more to do with a holistic approach than any sleight on individual performance. \u201cIt\u2019s never about Isaiah.

Per Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle , the Rockets and GM Daryl Morey have agreed to a five-year contract extension . Morey last signed a contract extension in the summer of 2017 , a four-year deal that kept him with Houston through the 2021-22 season. \u201cI\u2019m super happy,\u201d Morey told the Houston Chronicle . \u201cI\u2019d love to be with the Rockets for life. This obviously solidifies us for a little while. I\u2019m just really thankful to Tilman Fertitta for having the faith in our team. And really, it is about us having a team of people that makes this all work; Coach (Mike) D\u2019Antoni, (vice president) Keith Jones, (vice president) Gersson Rosas, (trainer) Jason Biles, (assistant general manager) Monte McNair, (assistant general manager) Eli Witus, (assistant general manager, Vipers GM) Jimmy Paulis. \u201cWe have too many people to mention, but I\u2019m only as good as the people behind me.\u201d In addition to the Morey move, the Rockets also picked up the option on D\u2019Antoni\u2019s contract, which will keep him under contract through 2019-20. Morey told the Houston Chronicle he wants to work on an extension for D\u2019Antoni this summer. \u201cHe\u2019s such a critical factor,\u201d Morey told the newspaper. \u201cSpeaking for myself only, I would love for him to be here for as long as he wants to be here. He\u2019s so critical to everything we\u2019re doing here. Hopefully, that\u2019s something we can work out at the right time. I think the right thing for everyone is those things are done in the off-season.\u201d Last summer, the Philadelphia 76ers were rebuffed in their attempts to hire away Morey in the wake of the Bryan Colangelo firing .  The Rockets are 42-25 and No. 3 in the Western Conference . They won a franchise-record 65 games in 2017-18 and posted the league\u2019s highest win total for the first time in team history. Dating back to Morey\u2019s first full season with Houston in 2006-07, the Rockets have the second-most wins of any team in the NBA and have won at least 54 games in four of the past five seasons. Morey is in the midst of his 13th season with the Rockets. He officially assumed his current position on May 10, 2007 after originally joining the organization as Assistant General Manager on Apr. 3, 2006. Before joining the Rockets, Morey spent three years as the Senior Vice President of Operations and Information for the Boston Celtics. Since his days in Boston and to his current time with Houston, Morey has been at the forefront of using analytical methods, statistics and other technology to enhance basketball-making decision during the Draft, in trades and free agency.

With all due respect to Brook Lopez, Ersan Ilyasova and most recently Nikola Mirotic, Mike Budenholzer was Milwaukee\u2019s top acquisition for this season. Changed the culture, gave talented players a plan, a confidence and a freedom that had been lacking there under Jason Kidd. Denver\u2019s Mike Malone is at the other end of the spectrum, a guy who has labored for four seasons to help the Nuggets become one of this season\u2019s \u201covernight sensations.\u201d And for those who didn\u2019t appreciate the job Indiana\u2019s Nate McMillan did last season \u2014 be honest, did you expect the Pacers to jump to 48 victories after reluctantly trading Paul George? \u2014 this is a chance to make amends based on keeping them afloat after what could have been a devastating blow of losing Victor Oladipo. Tas Melas :  Mike Budenholzer, Doc Rivers and Nate McMillan , in that order. Shaun Powell :  Mike Malone takes the pole position because he reshaped a team that didn\u2019t even make the playoffs last season to one that could finish with the best record in the toughest conference. Second is Mike Budenholzer , whose emphasis on three-point shooting and defense has the Bucks holding the best record in the NBA. And third is Kenny Atkinson of the Nets , who were hardly expected to contend for a playoff spot but here they are. These are tough choices because Doc Rivers and Nate McMillan are very deserving as well. There is no wrong answer. John Schuhmann :  Kenny Atkinson, Michael Malone and Nate McMillan all deserve consideration for pushing their teams beyond expectations, despite injuries to key players. Doc Rivers, meanwhile, has done a terrific job of getting a roster in transition \u2014 no current Clipper (save the injured Luc Mbah a Moute) was on the roster two seasons ago and a bunch of rotation guys are free agents (or potential free agents) this summer \u2014 to play for each other. Two of the four coaches above will be on my ballot and it will be difficult the other two off. But, given how much the Bucks have improved \u2014 they\u2019re the league\u2019s third-most improved team on offense ( 4.7 points per 100 possessions ) and its most improved on defense (4.5 per 100) from last season \u2014 the top spot on my ballot will almost certainly go to Mike Budenholzer .  Sekou Smith :  I need four as I have\u2019t been able to trim my list just yet. In no particular order, my top four today is Mike Malone, Mike Budenholzer, Nate McMillan and Doc Rivers. I understand the strong cases that could be made for each guy. Bud has his team atop the standings in the Eastern Conference and overall. That\u2019s usually enough on its own to merit Coach of the Year honors. But what Malone has done with a team that missed the playoffs on the final night of last season to now is flat out remarkable. McMillan has kept the Pacers afloat in the aftermath of Victor Oladipo\u2019s season-ending injury . Rivers has the Clippers locked in for a playoff spot after the they\u2019ve done nothing but shed talent the past two and a half seasons. In a season filled with compelling award races this season, this one could be the tightest."},{"id":35019,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-will-lebron-all-nba-first-team-streak-end","date":"2019-03-13","title":"Blogtable: Will LeBron's run of All-NBA first team spots end this season?","content":"* * * LeBron\u2019s streak of 13-straight playoff appearances and eight-straight NBA Finals will likely come to an end this season. What about his 11-season streak as a first team All-NBA selection ?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Well, the two best forwards in the NBA this season have been Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Oklahoma City\u2019s Paul George. After that, you can make arguments on behalf of Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant and Detroit\u2019s Blake Griffin. Then there is Toronto\u2019s Kawhi Leonard, who has missed about the same number of games as James but whose Raptors team is about 17 games better in the standings. It\u2019s possible LeBron will stay as motivated as he looked Tuesday in Chicago (36 points, 10 rebounds) and put up some flashy numbers down the stretch. But they\u2019ll come in games that essentially mean nothing, and there are too many rivals over whom he must climb, in too little time. Yes, this streak\u2019s over too. Tas Melas :  The All-NBA first team run is one of the many impressive LeBron streaks which will end this season (my favorite is Top-5 in MVP voting for 13 straight seasons). Giannis Antetokounmpo is on the first team. Kevin Durant will likely join him, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Paul George join my Greek brother. One of KD or PG will be on the second team with LeBron, but \u2018Bron will be in a battle with Kawhi Leonard and Blake Griffin for that other spot. Shaun Powell :  That will come to an end, too . It has been a forgettable season for LeBron, because you can tack on the semi-serious groin injury as well. So many things \u2014 bad things \u2014 happened to him this season to make it a turning point in his career, should the following seasons disappoint as well. This is somewhat \u201cnew\u201d to him, and for us as well. We\u2019ll see how the playoffs fare without him. John Schuhmann :  It\u2019s done, and it\u2019s possible that he doesn\u2019t even make the second team. As things stand now, I would have four forwards \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard \u2014 ahead of James on my All-NBA ballot. And it seems doubtful that James, with the Lakers playing out the string and the other four forwards all contributing (on both ends of the floor) to much better teams, can replace any of them in the final month of the season.  Sekou Smith :  All of LeBron\u2019s streaks come to an end. The playoffs, Finals and, yes, that first team All-NBA streak he\u2019s kept in a vice grip all these years. There\u2019s no shame in falling back this season. I\u2019m not one to knock LeBron this season, even though I know it\u2019s the convenient thing for some people to do. This break from LeBron ruining the NBA narrative from training camp to The Finals will be interesting. If anyone has earned the time it\u2019s LeBron. The time away will do wonders for his mental and physical well being, not to mention serve as the great motivator for the 34-year-old veteran who needs something to crank his engine during the offseason."},{"id":35022,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-rockets-warriors-season-series-discussion","date":"2019-03-13","title":"Blogtable: Can Rockets handle Warriors in a playoff series?","content":"* * * Would another Houston victory over Golden State tonight convince you that the Rockets can handle the Warriors in a playoff series?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Can? The furthest I\u2019ll go is \u201cmight be able to.\u201d That particular matchup, for me, is working both ends of the gotta-see-it-to-believe-it scale. I need to see the defending champions go down before I\u2019m willing to count them out, and I need to see their primary challengers actually defeat Golden State to know they can do it. Regular-season games \u2013 regrettably, for reasons ranging from injuries to scheduling to gamesmanship \u2013 don\u2019t tell us much in 2019 about what will or won\u2019t happen in a playoff setting. Houston has weapons, it has its health now and it even has demonstrated it can push the Warriors to a Game 7. But it hasn\u2019t done anything to assure us it can win one. Tas Melas :  I don\u2019t need yet another win \u2014 the performance in last year\u2019s playoffs plus the 3-0 record this season leads me to believe, that they believe, that the \u2018We Believe\u2019 Warriors might even be in trouble. Houston is the only team in the West that can give them a real playoff test because of their recent success and the fact they play such a different style than Golden State. The Rockets\u2019 depth and lack of reps with some of that depth (Austin Rivers, Kenneth Faried) is a concern, but hey, it\u2019s the Warriors \u2014 no one is issue-free when playing the league\u2019s best. Shaun Powell :  Don\u2019t believe the Rockets need another victory to have the respect of the Warriors and also raise the possibility of a postseason upset. This is virtually the same Rockets team that took the Warriors to the limit last spring, minus Trevor Ariza but plus Kenneth Faried, who brings a different dimension. To beat the Warriors you need a superstar (James Harden), and a smart supporting cast (Chris Paul) and a rim protector (Clint Capela) and, of course, hope the Warriors are off their game.This can happen. John Schuhmann :  No.  Kevin Durant won\u2019t be playing and the regular season is not the playoffs. The Rockets are looking more like the favorite to be the other team in the Western Conference finals, and while their defense has taken a big step backward this season (only the Spurs have seen a bigger increase in points allowed per 100 possessions), they\u2019ve defended the Warriors better than they did last year . And the Warriors could have a tougher time flipping the switch than they did a year ago, given their own regression on defense. Houston beating Golden State in the playoffs is certainly possible, but nothing (aside from multiple injuries) would convince me (that\u2019s a strong word) that the Warriors can lose a postseason series \u2026 until I see it happen.  Sekou Smith :  Another regular season win for the Rockets over the Warriors doesn\u2019t convince me of anything. I saw them handle the Warriors last year and go up 3-2 in the Western Conference finals \u2026 and still come up short when it mattered most. Nothing will erase the image of those Rockets, with their best record in the league and all that \u201cswag,\u201d as James Harden calls it, dashed as they walked off the Toyota Center floor last summer. They were stunned it ended the way it did, with that futile 3-point shooting effort in Game 7 . They haven\u2019t reconstituted themselves this season or changed the way they play, so I don\u2019t know why there would be any added confidence in their ability to dethrone the Warriors this time around. That said, they remain the most serious challenger to the Warriors for the second straight season."},{"id":35025,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kareem-abdul-jabbar-glad-see-records-broken","date":"2019-03-13","title":"Abdul-Jabbar says he cheers those who break his records","content":" Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is one of the living legends in the NBA, ranking as the game\u2019s all-time leader in points scored , minutes played , field goals made and attempted . Upon his retirement in 1989, no player had ever scored more points, blocked more shots, won more Most Valuable Player Awards, played in more All-Star Games or logged more seasons than him. That has changed since then, as Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 now 71 \u2014 has watched as some of his all-time records have fallen. Last week, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James passed Michael Jordan for fourth on the all-time scoring list. James currently needs 6,011 more points to leapfrog Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer, a feat that may still be possible for James to accomplish as his career winds down. To Abdul-Jabbar, though, the notion of his all-time scoring mark being passed is not one he is fretting over. Quite the opposite, it seems, as Abdul-Jabbar opened up on that topic in a piece he wrote for The Guardian newspaper that was published Wednesday. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m introduced in a public setting, my list of NBA records is announced,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote . \u201cBut whenever someone closes in on one of my remaining records, especially the Moby-Dick as the all-time leading scorer, I\u2019m asked by dozens of media people whether I think they can do it and how I\u2019ll feel if they do. It\u2019s as if people think I\u2019m sitting home watching the games chanting: Miss! Miss! Miss! \u201c Actually, when I see these talented veteran players\u2019 remarkable athleticism while shooting, blocking and rebounding, I\u2019m cheering them on with \u201cGo, man, go!\u201d \u2026 I want them to break my records because doing so is one more benchmark of human progress.\u201d In his storied career, Abdul-Jabbar was Rookie of the Year, a member of six NBA championship teams, a six-time NBA MVP, a two-time NBA Finals MVP, a 19-time All-Star, a two-time scoring champion and a member of the NBA 35th and 50th Anniversary All-Time Teams. When James passed Jordan last week on the list, Abdul-Jabbar cited his Instagram post on the moment in which he congratulated LeBron. \u201cHey LeBron, I just wanted to congratulate you on your most recent accomplishment, passing Michael Jordan,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote in his Instagram post. \u201cI know he was your hero, and how much it means to you to pass someone that you admired your whole life. The same thing happened to me, back in 1984, when I was able to pass Wilt [Chamberlain]\u2019s record, someone that I had admired when I was a kid. So I know what that means to you, and it\u2019s a very special day, so congratulations for that.\u201d Abdul-Jabbar also wrote that seeing a record broken \u2014 be it his own in the NBA or in another sport \u2014 serves an an inspiration to him. \u201cBreaking athletic records is important to a society because every time we extend a jump by half an inch or shave a race by a tenth of a second, we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what we think the human body is capable of. \u2026 Each time an athlete demonstrates that a person is capable of more than we thought, they have inspired all of humanity to realize that they are capable of reaching further than they thought possible. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s ever watched as an Olympic gymnast somersaults impossibly high with unimaginable speed and unprecedented control, shares that tingle of stunned elation and burst of pride that a human being can do that. Followed by the realization: maybe there\u2019s more that I can do, too.\u201d He also cited how people of color who have broken athletic records have inspired him as well. He also says how his hero, Chamberlain, holds numerous NBA records, but also had his share of dubious records as well. \u201cA historic aspect of record breaking that can\u2019t be ignored is that people of color have motivated themselves to break records as a way of proving themselves to a predominantly white society,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote in The Guardian . \u201cIn some sports, it has only been decades since we have been allowed to compete alongside white players: 1950 for the NBA, 1947 for the MLB, 1946 for the NFL. The fame, the money, and the adulation that players of color earn when breaking records adds status to their entire community. \u201cSometimes I think people overlook equally important statistics. My basketball hero, Wilt Chamberlain, who retired 56 years ago, still holds 72 NBA records, several of which are considered unbreakable. \u2026 At the same time we celebrate record achievements, we need to acknowledge epic failures that make those achievements possible. Our successes make us happy, but our failures make us stronger.\u201d Should he be around to witness it, Abdul-Jabbar says he will always be cheering for whomever happens to break any of his remaining records. \u201cWhat will I be doing the day LeBron \u2013 or some little kid on a playground right now chucking up free throws \u2013 breaks my record? I\u2019ll be cheering from the stands, \u201cGo, man, go!\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote."},{"id":35043,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/westbrook-mitchell-jazz-respond","date":"2019-03-13","title":"Mitchell, Jazz back Westbrook, say Utah won\u2019t condone racism","content":"NBA star Russell Westbrook will play in Utah again one day. When he does, a fan who allegedly made racial taunts against him will not be there to watch. A day after the Oklahoma City Thunder standout directed vulgar comments \u2014 which were captured on video and went viral \u2014 toward two fans, the Utah Jazz responded by banning a fan from their arena. Westbrook also got support from Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who said it wasn\u2019t the first time a racially motivated event happened at a Jazz game. \u201cThe Utah Jazz will not tolerate fans who act inappropriately,\u201d the Jazz said in a statement. \u201cThere is no place in our game for personal attacks or disrespect.\u201d Westbrook was fined $25,000 for \u201cdirecting profanity and threatening language to a fan.\u201d In the video, which was posted to Twitter by The Deseret News , Westbrook is seen on the sideline near the Thunder bench saying \u201cI\u2019ll (bleep) you up, you and your wife.\u201d The comment, and threatening a woman, is not a good look for the image-conscious NBA \u2014 especially since it came from a former Most Valuable Player and one of the game\u2019s biggest stars. But Westbrook, who has had multiple angry in-game exchanges with fans, insisted that Monday night\u2019s video during a 98-89 Oklahoma City win over the Jazz told only one side of the story. He said he was responding to a racial taunt, and not for the first time in Salt Lake City. \u201cEvery time I come here, a lot of disrespectful things are said,\u201d Westbrook said . He added that he has never physically abused a woman and never would. The man Westbrook was shouting at during the game, identified as Shane Keisel, denied saying anything improper or profane. The Jazz did not name Keisel in their statement announcing the ban, and a phone number for him rang unanswered. What exactly happened is unclear, but some of Westbrook\u2019s peers in the NBA came to his defense Tuesday, saying fans who sit near players in many arenas now feel emboldened to say things that would be described as disrespectful or worse. Mitchell said he will devote some time in the coming months to try to combat racial inequality. The most recent population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show that about 2 percent of Utah\u2019s population is black, the lowest percentage of any state that has a major pro sports team. \u201cRacism and hate speech hurts us all, and this is not the first time something like this has happened in our arena,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe Utah that I have come to love is welcoming and inclusive, and last night\u2019s incident is not indicative of our fan base.\u201d Westbrook has had run-ins with fans before \u2014 and reacted calmly last month when it appeared he was touched by a child sitting courtside. Others have not been as pleasant, and Denver\u2019s Will Barton said he believes fans know they can get a reaction from Westbrook. \u201cThey know he\u2019s going to react a little bit or might say something,\u201d Barton said. \u201cNow I feel like every time he goes on the road, they\u2019re picking at him. I don\u2019t know what the league can do, but some of those fans are out of control.\u201d In a social media age, anything can be captured by cameras. TMZ Sports obtained video last week of New York Knicks owner James Dolan at Madison Square Garden when he heard a fan that he was walking past yell \u201cSell the team.\u201d Dolan told the fan he was rude, asked if he wanted to come to any more games and then told him to \u201cenjoy watching them on TV.\u201d Fans boo. That\u2019s expected and even encouraged in arenas. But unlike games in the NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball, fans in the best seats at NBA arenas sit only a few inches from the playing surface, the coaches and the players \u2014 with no obstruction between them. On occasion, some coaches are even seen engaging in conversations with fans during games. Sometimes, the banter is friendly. Often, it is not. \u201cIt\u2019s great having fans into their home team, and taunting and that noise level in great arenas, opposing places, is awesome,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want. But you don\u2019t need to cross the line and say something that you would never say if you were walking up to one of these guys on the street.\u201d One of the league\u2019s lowest moments came Nov. 19, 2004, during a game between Indiana and Detroit. Tensions boiled over on the floor after a hard foul led to some pushing and shoving, and then fans became involved \u2014 a drink was thrown at the Pacers\u2019 bench, prompting Metta World Peace (then known as Ron Artest) to climb into the stands. A melee ensued, and nine players were suspended. Nothing to that extreme has happened since, though incidents between players and fans are hardly uncommon. There is a fan code of conduct at all NBA games, including a part that says guests \u201cwill enjoy the basketball experience free from disruptive behavior, including foul or abusive language or obscene gestures.\u201d Violators are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and each team handles things its own way. At the Utah game Monday night, some fans were issued warning cards but allowed to return to their seats. Keisel told Salt Lake City television station KSL that he told Westbrook to \u201csit down and ice your knees, bro.\u201d Westbrook claimed that Keisel said to \u201cget down on my knees like you\u2019re used to.\u201d The Thunder did not have any comment other than the statement Westbrook made to reporters after the game. Westbrook has been upset about fans in Utah before. The Jazz eliminated the Thunder from last season\u2019s playoffs, and as Westbrook walked off the floor immediately after that loss, he swiped at a fan who was taping him with his phone. Later that night, Westbrook described fans in Utah as \u201ctruly disrespectful.\u201d \u201cMost of the time, the microphone or the camera is on the player,\u201d Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. \u201cIt goes both ways. A lot of times it\u2019s started from the other way and is directed at the player. You want to say, \u2018Be above it. Be bigger than that.\u2019 But a lot of times, if it\u2019s personal, it becomes some things that you just cannot deny or you cannot ignore.\u201d Westbrook and the Thunder have finished their season series with the Jazz. Unless the teams meet in the playoffs, the earliest he would play again in Salt Lake City is next October."},{"id":35052,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-3-12-19","date":"2019-03-13","title":"About Last Night: McCollum catches fire to spark Blazers","content":" C.J. McCollum is on a roll, and Tuesday night saw him catch fire to save the Trail Blazers in Los Angeles. McCollum took over in the fourth quarter, scoring 23 of his 35 in the period to help the Blazers beat the Clippers 125-104 and strengthen their bid for home-court advantage in the Western Conference. After missing his first seven shots of the game, McCollum heated up in the fourth, going 8-for-9 from the field, hitting all four 3-point attempts and helping Portland pull away from the Clippers, who had their five-game winning streak snapped. In one stretch, McCollum scored 13 straight points during a 15-3 outburst that put the game away. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt myself when I\u2019m missing shots,\u201d McCollum said in a postgame on-court interview. But McCollum perked up noticeably when asked about another topic \u2013 the Cleveland Browns\u2019 reported trade for star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. McCollum, an Ohio native and big Browns fan, sees good things on the horizon for his favorite NFL team. \u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling on Sundays for a long time now,\u201d McCollum said in a postgame interview. \u201cThis last year we turned it around. I\u2019m looking forward to the future. It\u2019s very bright. \u2026 OBJ, welcome! \u2026 Let\u2019s get it!\u201d With 15 games left in the season, the future is looking bright for the Trail Blazers, as well. They currently sit fifth in the West with an identical record to the Thunder and just a game behind the Rockets at No. 3. Check out all the highlights from McCollum\u2019s big night: LeBron takes flight in Chicago  With the banged-up Lakers mired in a five-game losing streak, the Lakers needed LeBron James on Tuesday night. And boy did he step up. James scored 36 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to help the Lakers rally from a 20-point deficit to beat Chicago 123-107 to end their slide. With the Lakers\u2019 playoff hopes on life support, LeBron played 33 minutes and threw down a ferocious reverse dunk from a Josh Hart off-the-backboard pass that virtually sealed the win. Leave it to NBAE photographer Nathaniel S. Butler to capture the moment perfectly: And that might not have been LeBron\u2019s best dunk of the night. Earlier in the game, LeBron finished off an incredible lead pass from Kyle Kuzma, catching the full-court feed off the bounce for another killer reverse. Wolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns had one of the more powerful slams of the night, throwing down this beauty in the Wolves\u2019 133-107 loss to the Nuggets: Worth the wait, Part II  The feel-good moment of the night goes to Lakers guard Andre Ingram, who received a warm welcome when he checked into the game in Chicago. Ingram, of course, is the 33-year-old journeyman who grabbed headlines last April by playing his first NBA game after spending 10 years grinding in the NBA G League. Ingram scored five points in that contest, igniting the crowd with his feel-good story. Tuesday, Ingram played just two minutes \u2013 missing his only shot \u2014 in the Lakers\u2019 123-107 win over the Bulls, but the impact of Ingram\u2019s story clearly resonates around the entire NBA.  Here\u2019s reason No. 23,456 why the Pacers are currently fourth in the East despite losing All-Star Victor Oladipo to a season-ending leg injury: Myles Turner showing some hustle, and Thaddeus Young dropping a slick dime to a cutting Darren Collison. The Pacers stopped a two-game slide by beating the Knicks 103-98 to strengthen their grip on the No. 4 seed in the East and stay even with Philly at 43-25. Anything you can do \u2026  Or rather, anything Ben Simmons can do \u2026 Joel Embiid can do better \u2026 Philly needed everything from its pair of stars Tuesday in a 106-99 win over the Cavs. Simmons scored 26 with 10 points and eight assist, while Embiid added 17 points and 19 rebounds as the Sixers eked one out at home. It never gets old: And neither do shots of Nowitzki\u2019s fabulous locks through the years: Luka Doncic had one of the worst nights of his young career, but this pass is worth another look: Doncic finished with 12 points on 5-for-18 shooting from the field and made just 1 of 9 from the free throw line in the Mavericks\u2019 112-105 loss to the Spurs. Doncic also had nine turnovers as he started despite a strained knee.

After an investigation by the Jazz , the team announced on Tuesday their decision to permanently ban the fan from all future events at Vivint Smart Home Arena because of \u201cexcessive and derogatory verbal abuse directed at a player\u201d. Early in the second quarter, Westbrook stood up from the bench when he felt both fans directed a racial taunt at him. According to the Thunder guard, they told him to \u201cget down on my knees like I used to.\u201d After that, Westbrook was seen on video cursing at the man and his wife. According to multiple reports, some of Westbrook\u2019s comments were caught on video by another fan . \u201cI swear to god, I\u2019ll [expletive] you up. You and your wife, I\u2019ll [expletive] you up. Promise you on everything I love, I promise you,\u201d Westbrook says to a fan on the video. On Tuesday, the NBA fined Westbrook for his comments towards the fan. Westbrook expressed concern following Monday\u2019s game with the verbal abuse he and teammates have received from fans on the road. Much of it has been directed at their families, according to Westbrook. He said he is done tolerating their disrespect. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m just not going to continue to take disrespect for my family,\u201d said Westbrook after the game, per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . \u201cI just think there\u2019s got to be something done. There\u2019s got to be some consequences for those type of people that come to the game just to say and do whatever they want to say. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the players \u2014 not just to me, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the players. \u201cAnd if I had to do it again, I would say the same exact thing, because I truly will stand up for myself, for my family, for my kids, for my wife, for my mom, for my dad every single time. I expect anybody else to do the same. So that\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at with the whole situation. As for beating up his wife, I have never put my hand on a woman; I never will. Never been in any domestic violence before. Never have before, but once he said the comment, his wife repeated the same thing to me as well. So that\u2019s kind of how that started. \u201cI know you guys only got the tail end of the video, but the start of the video is way more important and way more disrespectful than what you guys heard. There\u2019s got to be something done. There\u2019s got to be some consequences for those type of people that come to the game just to say and do whatever they want to say. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the players.\u201d The fan, 45-year-old Shane Keisel, told ESPN that he did not swear or say anything inappropriate at Westbrook. He said that the exchange \u201cstarted off as fun\u201d with him yelling at Westbrook to \u201cice those knees up!\u201d. Keisel said Westbrook told him it was heat on his knees, to which Keisel hollered, \u201cYou\u2019re going to need it.\u201d Keisel also told ESPN that his girlfriend, Jennifer Huff, did not participate in any of the exchange. \u201cHe just went nuts,\u201d Keisel told ESPN . \u201cShe never got up. She never stood up. She never said a word to him. I mean, it\u2019s all fine, we\u2019re having fun and games with the guy and we\u2019re talking, but at the end of the day, no man should threaten a woman, period. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the guy.

The crossroads is clearly marked, the only uncertainty being which path James takes. In likely missing the NBA playoffs for the first time in 14 years, will James lose the focus so essential to his day job and plunge headlong into the entertainment and philanthropic pursuits that intrigue him and fill up so many of the hours not demanded by basketball? Or, with two additional months freed up by missing not just the postseason but The Finals for the first time since 2010 , will James up his gym time and challenge himself physically and mentally to come back healthier, stronger and better for 2019-20, the season during which he\u2019ll turn 35 years old? At least one of James\u2019 old cronies expects the latter. As Kevin Love told Cleveland.com recently , \u201cJust having that break, being able to reassess and come back really, really highly motivated is going to be big for him. If you get \u2018Bron highly motivated anything can happen.\u201d First, of course, comes a period of adjustment in processing a season without any playoff possibilities. That hasn\u2019t been part of the James brand since 2005, his second year in the NBA, back when he still couldn\u2019t legally buy an adult beverage. Even if his body craves a longer layoff after eight straight Finals trips, during which he averaged nearly 97 regular season and postseason appearances \u2014 cramming in the equivalent of two extra seasons \u2014 it figures to be disorienting to be idled when more than half the league keeps going come mid-April. It also will bump James down a rung among the game\u2019s legendary players, as measured by how frequently or infrequently they failed to lead their teams into the playoffs. From a collection of 30 of the NBA\u2019s best players ever, nine never missed a chance to qualify for the big spring tournament. Eight more did it in all but one or two of the years they played, a group that includes G.O.A.T. candidates Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Jordan. James, once his Lakers are mathematically eliminated from this year\u2019s field of 16, will slip to the next tier of Hall of Fame-worthy players who failed to steer their clubs home three times. Then there\u2019s the group who wound up outside looking in four or more times for whatever reasons. In all, this group of 30 greats have logged 459 individual seasons, only 65 of which ended without a playoff berth. That\u2019s how rare and out of character this 2018-19 Lakers season has been, not just for James\u2019 legacy but in comparison to the best of the best. Here is a look at the ones that got away:  First time, every time (9)  Elgin Baylor: 13 seasons, no misses, 1.000 He missed the playoffs in 1971 due to injury and retired nine games in the following season, but the Lakers never failed to qualify in his one-franchise career. Larry Bird: 13 seasons, no misses, 1.000 Bird missed the postseason in 1989, the year he played in only six games, though the Celtics did not.  Bob Cousy: 13 seasons, no misses, 1.000 We\u2019re not going to hold the 1969-70 season \u2013 when Cousy played limited minutes in seven games as Cincinnati\u2019s player-coach, six years after retiring \u2013 against him. Tim Duncan: 19 years, no misses, 1.000 No one in league history has gone 20-for-20, so Duncan and Karl Malone are the best of our 1.000 hitters. Duncan missed the 2000 playoffs due to injury and that was too much for the defending-champion Spurs to overcome, getting ousted by Phoenix in four. Julius Erving: 11 seasons, no misses, 1.000 And that\u2019s just his NBA years. The Doctor went 5-for-5 in the ABA, twice winning titles with the Nets and averaging 31.1 points and 12.9 boards in those five postseasons. Magic Johnson: 13 seasons, no misses, 1.000 This even includes his limited 1995-96 season, a forgettable 32-game comeback after four years of retirement. Karl Malone: 19 seasons, no misses, 1.000 The Mailman\u2019s running buddy, John Stockton, never missed, either, in his 19-year Hall of Fame career. Bill Russell: 13 seasons, no misses, 1.000 The idea of this guy and his Boston team sitting out a postseason is unimaginable. Jerry West: 13 seasons, no misses, 1.000 West was such a noble and, with the exception of the Lakers\u2019 title in \u201972, ill-fated playoff performer that he was named Finals MVP in 1970 from the losing side. The asterisk club (3)  Wilt Chamberlain: 14 seasons, one miss (1963), .929 In any conversation about G.O.A.T. candidates, Chamberlain\u2019s teams missed the playoffs fewer times than either Jordan\u2019s (twice) or James (three). Scottie Pippen: 17 seasons, one miss (2004), .941 Six of Pippen\u2019s postseason appearances came when he wasn\u2019t a teammate of Michael Jordan. David Robinson: 14 seasons, one miss (1997), .929 The Spurs got swept from the first round when Robinson couldn\u2019t participate in the 1992 postseason. When he was hurt again in 1997, San Antonio missed the playoffs entirely but landed Duncan in a stroke of lottery luck. Fool me twice\u2026 (5)  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 20 seasons, two misses (1975, \u201976), .900 This was not a happy Captain in his post-Oscar, pre-Magic run through his prime of two misses and five postseasons (1975-79) without a Finals appearance. Michael Jordan: 15 seasons, two misses (2002, \u201903), .867 Jordan\u2019s Bulls era is unsullied, but his return to action with Washington was a business decision that scratched a personal itch rather than a winning strategy. Shaquille O\u2019Neal: 19 seasons, two misses (1993, \u201909), .895 The No. 8 seed in the East in 2009 won 39 games, but Phoenix\u2019s 46 weren\u2019t enough in the West that season. O\u2019Neal also missed as a rookie with Orlando (1992-93). Bob Pettit: 11 seasons, two misses, .818 Pettit\u2019s Hawks teams missed the playoffs in his 1955 Rookie of the Year season and again in 1962, despite his 31.1 ppg and 18.7 rpg. Dwyane Wade: 16 seasons, two misses (2008, \u201915), .875 Miami held the No. 8 spot in the East as this was written, so it counts among his 14 trips to the postseason thus far. Three strikes, you\u2019re out! (7)  Charles Barkley: 16 seasons, three misses (1988, \u201992, \u201900), .813 Barkley\u2019s three stops \u2013 in Philadelphia, Phoenix and Houston \u2013 couldn\u2019t sustain playoff excellence enough to earn him a ring. Rick Barry: 10 seasons, three misses (1966, \u201974, \u201978), .700 Barry\u2019s NBA\/ABA\/NBA again career included a personal playoff whiff with the Oakland Oaks in 1969, thanks to torn knee ligaments, though the team went 60-18 and won that league\u2019s championship. Stephen Curry: 10 seasons, three misses (2010, \u201911, \u201912), .700 People tend to forget how much of the Warriors\u2019 dark days Curry saw. They were a cumulative 60 games under .500 his first three seasons. Kevin Durant: 12 seasons, three misses (2008, \u201909, \u201915), .750 The SuperSonics\/Thunder were 43-121 his first two seasons, then missed again at 45-37 when Durant was limited to just 27 appearances by a foot injury. John Havlicek: 16 seasons, three misses (1970, \u201971, \u201978), .813 Won six rings with Russell, then bridged post-Russell gap to win two more in \u201974 and \u201976. LeBron James: 16 seasons, three misses (2004, \u201905, \u201919), .813 Lakers fans are hoping this is like Kobe Bryant\u2019s blip in \u201905 rather than his run of three straight lottery finishes prior to retirement. Hakeem Olajuwon: 18 seasons, three misses (1992, \u201900, \u201901), .833 Olajuwon\u2019s first year without a playoff appearance nearly got him traded. His last two signaled the end was near. To infinity and beyond (6)  Kobe Bryant: 20 seasons, four misses (2005, \u201914, \u201915, \u201916), .800 Bryant\u2019s extended off-ramp from his Hall of Fame career included three early offseasons. Kevin Garnett: 21 seasons, six misses (1996, \u201905, \u201906, \u201907, \u201915, \u201916), .714 The 2005-07 hole in the prime of Garnett\u2019s career, when Minnesota couldn\u2019t assemble a worthy supporting cast around him, is unique among the game\u2019s all-time greats. Moses Malone: 19 seasons, seven misses (1978, \u201986, \u201990, \u201992, \u201993, \u201994, \u201995), .632 Play for enough franchises \u2013 and Malone did, at seven \u2013 and you\u2019re bound to end up on some clunkers. Most of his misses came from ages 34-39. Dirk Nowitzki: 21 seasons, six misses (1999, \u201900, \u201913, \u201917, \u201918, \u201919), .714 Nowitzki has kind of a Kobe thing going on, his Hall of Fame-worthy greatness no longer enough to boost into the playoffs the only franchise for which he\u2019s played. Oscar Robertson: 14 seasons, four misses (1961, \u201968, \u201969, \u201970), .714 It was Robertson\u2019s final years in Cincinnati that prepared him for his late-career run (four playoffs, two Finals, one ring) with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in Milwaukee. Isiah Thomas: 13 seasons, four misses (1982, \u201983, \u201993, \u201994), .692 The Hall of Fame point guard missed in his first two and his last two seasons and, more specifically, never reached the postseason without Chuck Daly as coach. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In this sense, these are the dead giveaways about the current state of the Boston Celtics: Kyrie Irving isn\u2019t bringing down the mood in the room anymore. Coach Brad Stevens doesn\u2019t look like a confused coach. And the outside noise is quieter and so is the feeling of doom. When the Celtics took the flight to California on March 4, they were thankful for the Los Angeles Lakers \u2026 or else they\u2019d be Team Dysfunction. Seven days later, they\u2019re returning home refreshed and frisky, almost as if they spent a week on the West Coast vacationing instead of working. Don\u2019t put too much weight in their 140-115 loss Monday to the LA Clippers. They were ambushed by the better-than-you-think Clippers and played without Jayson Tatum (who sat out with a sore right shoulder). Any coach or veteran player will tell you that winning the last game of a road trip might be the toughest task of an NBA schedule. Well before last night\u2019s buzzer sounded, the goal was already accomplished. The Celtics had righted and re-positioned themselves as one of four teams with a realistic shot at winning the East. What we\u2019ve learned about the Celtics is that they\u2019re not the lost team of late February \u2026 and probably not completely free of problems either. Instead, the answer is simple: the season\u2019s too long. Over the course of 82 games, even contenders get face-palmed \u2014 just ask the Warriors about their 10 home losses. Yet the one thing that remains constant through it all? You\u2019re still a contender. And that\u2019s what the Celtics were during the low moments and still are after this 3-1 road trip. The playoffs \u2014 and nothing else \u2014 will determine the truth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been all over the map,\u201d Stevens said, \u201clike a lot of teams.\u201d Yes, it got shaky there for a minute if you dwell about the small picture. The Celtics are 41-27 \u2026 does that sound or look like a problem? \u201cWe were successful on this trip,\u201d said Irving, who stopped brooding \u2014 temporarily, anyway. \u201cNow we go home to handle our business. We\u2019ve got to keep it moving. Keep winning.\u201d The Celtics are being held, and holding themselves, to a high standard because of last season\u2019s run to the Eastern Conference finals without Irving. This team, well coached and well-assembled, flourished minus a top-10 player. Simple mathematics say Celtics-plus-Irving equals heavyweight this season. Yet it hasn\u2019t been so simple. For a variety of reasons, the Celtics never managed to sit atop the East and, at times, appeared disjointed on the floor. For all his deserved applause as a young coach, Stevens looked surprisingly helpless while trying to develop cohesion, consistency and harmony. After a superb 2018 playoffs, Tatum hasn\u2019t matched that level this season. And Gordon Hayward is still slow to return to Utah Jazz-era Hayward. And so, the Celtics surrendered the attic in the East to the Milwaukee Bucks and slowly drifted downward. Not out of playoff position, but it felt that way. The low point came in losing six of their eight games before this trip. They looked overmatched against the Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers during that stretch. And didn\u2019t the Celtics belong in that group? Chemistry was at risk and Irving handled the burden poorly within and beyond the locker room. A true leader uplifts his teammates, bravely faces questions and carries himself with great composure in tough times. Irving turned sour, seemed to deflect blame and mostly wanted nothing to do with the duties of leadership. But give him a pass on this. Great players aren\u2019t necessarily great leaders (and it\u2019s probably time we stop insisting they be). Plus, the Celtics\u2019 lackluster play then would\u2019ve tested anyone\u2019s patience. \u201cI\u2019ve been through too many battles to hang onto the same emotions game after game,\u201d Irving said. Truth be told, the Celtics have just as much of a chance to win the East title as the Bucks, Raptors or Philadelphia 76ers. They\u2019ve got a superstar in Irving and solid supporting pieces. Both Stevens and his roster are playoff tested, as few key players on the Bucks, Raptors or Sixers have gone deeper in the playoffs than the Celtics\u2019 have. Plus, the Celtics believe better days are coming, and that\u2019s half the battle, regaining that confidence. \u201cFor the most part we played great basketball on this trip,\u201d said Jaylen Brown. \u201cWe\u2019ve been away from home a long time. We wanted to get all four games on this trip, but it\u2019ll be good to go home and take the next step. We\u2019ve just got to pick it up. And you do that by winning. Winning stands out.\u201d Brown says the right formula is staying true to your identity, something that escaped the Celtics for a while. \u201cWhen we play with tempo and pace, it\u2019s tough for anyone to beat us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we slow it down \u2026\u201d Sometimes when players on a team is on the road, they can\u2019t escape each other. They\u2019re at the same hotel, sometimes eat at the same spot, and that can have a unifying effect. Perhaps that has been the case in California for the Celtics. \u201cThe way we played and stayed together, it showed,\u201d said Al Horford. \u201cWe played with a purpose and want to continue that way. It\u2019s about consistency, and we did a lot of that on this trip.\u201d Half of Boston\u2019s remaining 14 games are against teams currently .500 or better. In April, four of their five games are against teams with losing records. At 1 1\/2 games out of third place \u2014 the Celtics\u2019 ceiling \u2014 that goal could still be reached to close out 2018-19. That\u2019s why anyone who made a final statement on the Celtics prior this trip was being too hasty. The NBA season is long, and rough patches are expected. The Celtics, perhaps, have hit their final one. It\u2019s probably wise, though, that they don\u2019t believe that and fall into a trap. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we solved a puzzle after three (wins),\u201d said Stevens. \u201cWe have to get better.\u201d Yes, they do. But same goes for any team that calls itself a contender. The pack is just too tight and the competition too stiff in the East. The Celtics had to get as far away from home as possible for an entire week to find out who they are. But road trips, as fine as they turn out to be, do have their limits. \u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d Irving said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here long enough. No disrespect to any California native, but we need to get out.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It was competitive for about a quarter. Taking advantage of their customary balance, the Nets never trailed over the final 45:26 and led by as many as 31 en route to a comprehensive 103-75 conquest. It was their third-largest victory of the season, and the second-largest defeat for the Pistons. Of more importance, the Nets hopped past the Pistons by half a game for sixth place in the Eastern Conference as they continue to pursue their first playoff berth in four years. The victory clinched the season series for the Nets at 2-1. Given that both they and the Pistons are likely too low in the standings to climb any higher than sixth, that could be critical as they play their remaining 13 and 16 games, respectively. (The Heat sit in eighth place with 16 games left, and trail the Nets by just two in the loss column with one last meeting on April 10 in the regular-season finale.) \u201dThey brought a tough mindset and a much more physical game,\u201d said Pistons forward Blake Griffin, who was limited to 10 points on 1-for-10 shooting. What the Nets lack in star power \u2014 sorry, D\u2019Angelo Russell, you\u2019re not quite there, recent All-Star berth notwithstanding \u2014 they more than make up for with depth and chemistry. Both traits were on full display against the Pistons with seven double-figure scorers and a smothering defensive effort. Indeed, in addition to allowing their fewest points since Dec. 2014, a span of 375 games, Detroit\u2019s miserable 27.8 shooting percentage was the third worst by a Nets opponent \u2014 ever. \u201cOur guys attacked it,\u201d Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201dSometimes when you\u2019re not used to these big games you might be on your heels a little bit. But, I felt like we were the more aggressive team and we weren\u2019t afraid of the moment. Definitely a good sign for us if we have more of these big games in the future.\u201d We\u2019ll find out soon enough. The Nets now embark on an absolutely brutal 16-day, seven-game road trip featuring five teams currently slated to make the postseason, including the 76ers, Thunder, Trail Blazers and Jazz. Bring the same defensive intensity as they did against the Pistons, and they just might survive.  So, as you might have heard, things got pretty ugly Monday in Utah, where the Jazz are investigating a profanity-laced confrontation that took place between Thunder superstar Russell Westbrook and a fan. The incident marred what was otherwise an intriguing matchup between two potential postseason opponents who already don\u2019t like each other much after meeting in last season\u2019s playoffs, with the Jazz eliminating the Thunder 4-2 in the first round. Such setbacks can\u2019t be avenged in the regular season, but the Thunder did their level best by sweeping all four meetings, including Monday\u2019s 98-89 victory in which they led by as many as 17 in the fourth quarter. The Jazz did rally within six late in the period before Westbrook had the last word, scoring five points during a 9-1 run that put the game away. That included a 33-foot 3-pointer that he appeared to enjoy quite a bit: The narrative machine has been in full force for the Celtics lately, with tales of the beleaguered team bonding on their recent flight West surfacing as they stitched together a modest but much-needed three-game winning streak, including last week\u2019s 33-point throttling of the Warriors. Are the Celtics, scribes breathlessly asked, finally fixed? Maybe, maybe not. Turning in their worst defensive performance since 1994, the Celtics yielded a whopping 140 points to the Clippers, including 78 in the second half alone, en route to a 25-point defeat in which they led for a grand total of one possession. Much of that had to do with the Clippers, who continue to defy expectations. They did it again Monday as they shot 61.6 percent and Lou Williams scored 34 points to surpass Dell Curry as the all-time leader in bench points . Playing without the injured Jayson Tatum certainly didn\u2019t help. But the loss also fell squarely on the Celtics, who had ranked fourth in defensive efficiency coming in but mustered virtually zero resistance as the deficit ballooned to as much as 30 points. And now they head home facing many of the same doubts and questions as before. It hasn\u2019t been a great week for the NBA\u2019s best, with conference frontrunners Milwaukee and Golden State absorbing embarrassing losses to the Suns within a span of six days. Next up for a turn in the barrel? The Raptors, who lost 126-101 loss to a Cavaliers squad that trailed them by 31.5 games coming in. And they weren\u2019t even resting Kawhi Leonard! Adding insult to literal injury, they\u2019ll almost certainly be without Serge Ibaka for at least a game or two after he and Marquese Chriss were ejected for fighting. The Warriors endured probably their worst loss of the season on Sunday, losing to the lowly Suns despite entering as 17-point favorites. Ever the optimist, Stephen Curry noted that the Warriors have an immediate opportunity to turn the page with their next outing, a marquee matchup against Western Conference rival Houston. \u201cThe beauty of the NBA is that on Wednesday we have an opportunity to send a statement,\u201d said Curry, a s reported by ESPN . \u201cWe have to take advantage of that opportunity. We\u2019re looking forward to it, no question.\u201d Which teed up Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, no doubt feeling good after his team beat the Hornets for their ninth straight win, for an epic barb: Rockets point guard Chris Paul is used to dishing out assists. He was on the receiving end Monday courtesy of teammate Iman Shumpert\u2019s beautiful little daughter Junie. So, Joel Embiid got a new dog. He named it after former 76ers GM Sam Hinkie. That is all.

Oakley, a longtime NBA enforcer and rebounding machine, said Dolan was wrong to mouth off at a fan who told him to sell the team during a loss at MSG. Oakey knows as well as anyone what it\u2019s like to get ejected from the Garden, not just by the refs. His criticisms of the team and management have led to a strained relationship with the organization, which boiled over in 2017 when he was arrested after an altercation with security officials after they told him to leave his seat at the arena near Dolan. Oakley was cleared of misdemeanor assault charges last year. \u201cHe just tries to bully everybody and it just don\u2019t make sense,\u201d Oakley told The Associated Press on Monday. Oakley was angered by Dolan\u2019s reaction after New York lost on Saturday and a fan yelled at the owner to \u201csell the team.\u201d \u201cYou really think I should sell the team?\u201d Dolan said on video run on TMZ . Dolan asked the fan if he wanted to come to any more games, called him \u201crude\u201d and told him to \u201cenjoy watching them on TV.\u201d Dolan called for security, though it\u2019s not clear whether the fan has been actually been banned from games. \u201cOur policy is and will continue to be that if you are disrespectful to anyone in our venues, we will ask you not to return,\u201d the Madison Square Garden Company said in a statement. Oakley wasn\u2019t having it from Dolan. \u201cHe just bullies people because he has money and power,\u201d Oakley said. The 55-year-old Oakley played for the Knicks from 1988-98, helping them reach the NBA Finals. He attended games a few times a year, buying his own tickets because he was no longer comped or invited to official team functions. But his relationship with the franchise was frayed even before the 2017 altercation that included him hitting one security guard in the face and shoving at least one other before he was dragged away and handcuffed. Dolan lifted Oakley\u2019s ban from MSG shortly after meeting with Oakley and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Oakley said nothing was really settled in the meeting. Oakley said there was little reason for any reconciliation with Dolan. \u201cWhy would I want to do it with someone who had me dragged out of the Garden for no reason,\u201d Oakley said Monday. \u201cWhy would I want a relationship with him? I told him I wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d The Knicks are 13-54 and in last place in the Eastern Conference and have been one of the worst teams in the NBA over the last 20 years. \u201cI\u2019m allowed in 29 arenas except the Garden,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve said we\u2019d retire your jersey, they\u2019ll do this. But you think I want my jersey hanging outside the Garden? They can still see it. But you just dragged me outside the \u2026 Garden.\u201d"},{"id":35018,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kerr-acknowledges-cursing-green","date":"2019-03-12","title":"Kerr acknowledges cursing out of frustration with Green","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Steve Kerr acknowledged using an expletive to air his frustrations with Draymond Green when speaking to assistant coach Mike Brown during Sunday\u2019s 115-111 loss to the lowly Suns. The moment was caught on video and, while it wasn\u2019t audible, viewers could read Kerr\u2019s lips. Kerr wouldn\u2019t go into details regarding any discussion he had with Green on Monday, saying \u201cThat\u2019s private.\u201d The two-time defending champions didn\u2019t hold a formal practice and Kevin Durant was listed as day-to-day with a bruised right ankle he injured midway through the fourth quarter of the embarrassing defeat, which snapped an 18-game winning streak against Phoenix \u2014 longest in the NBA against a single opponent. The Warriors play again Wednesday at Houston to begin a tough four-game road trip. \u201cI\u2019m so \u2026 tired of Draymond!\u201d Kerr said in the video. Kerr joked that he didn\u2019t say what he appeared to say. \u201cNo, the lip-readers were wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I said was, \u2018I beg to differ with Draymond\u2019s approach tonight.\u2019 Those were my exact words. I don\u2019t know how somebody misconstrued that.\u201d Kerr has regularly praised Green\u2019s production on both ends of the court this season, though Golden State as a whole has struggled to play the kind of smothering defense that defined its run to a repeat title last season. However, the Warriors were not playing well on that end of the floor late in the 2018 regular season before taking it to another level defensively come playoff time. \u201cIf you look historically at any team trying to win multiple titles in a row, get to the finals year after year, there\u2019s a different vibe,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAs you go, the journey gets harder and there\u2019s more adversity. We saw it at the end of last year quite a bit. We were able to pull things together and win the title. We\u2019re seeing plenty of adversity this year. \u201cI tell the players every year, there\u2019s a reason you pour champagne on each other when it\u2019s all said and done, because it is hard. It is a difficult thing that we\u2019re trying to accomplish and it gets more difficult as you go just based on circumstances. We\u2019ve got our work cut out for us but we\u2019re still confident because of our track record, because of the banners that we\u2019ve hung, we\u2019re very confident that we can do this again. But it\u2019s not easy.\u201d When asked whether Green was fine after they spoke, Kerr said, \u201cagain, that\u2019s private.\u201d Green wasn\u2019t available Monday since the team didn\u2019t watch film or practice. Kerr noted such moments are far more public and glaring in this era of social media and smartphones. \u201cEverything\u2019s recorded, everything is filmed,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided I\u2019m now going to get a giant laminated board with all of my play calls and I\u2019m going to turn into an NFL coach from here on out. It\u2019s a different world. You\u2019ve got to figure out how to survive and thrive in the modern way of life. One way of doing it is not really concerning yourself with stuff that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d One thing that does matter to him: his players not arguing with the officials so much. \u201cI think we need to stop looking at the officials,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re complaining too much to the referees and we\u2019re spending too much energy arguing with the refs instead of just playing. I don\u2019t think that helped last night.\u201d * * *"},{"id":46540,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-sign-andre-ingram-10-day-official-release","date":"2019-03-11","title":"Lakers sign Andre Ingram to 10-day contract","content":" EL SEGUNDO \u2013 The Los Angeles Lakers have signed guard Andre Ingram to a 10-day contract, it was announced today.

That includes three wins (over Portland, Utah and Orlando) from the Memphis Grizzlies and two (over Denver and Utah), both on the road, from the New Orleans Pelicans. Of course, the two biggest surprises of March have come from the Phoenix Suns, who knocked off both the best team in the league (the Milwaukee Bucks) and the defending champs (the Golden State Warriors) last week, holding two of the league\u2019s top three offenses to just 103 points per 100 possessions. With an 7-1 stretch going into the All-Star break and a relatively easy schedule after it, the Orlando Magic looked like a safe pick to make the playoffs. But while the Magic have beat Toronto, Golden State and Indiana since the break, they\u2019ve also lost to Chicago, New York, Cleveland and Memphis. Though the Bucks have suffered some slippage, they remain at No. 1 in the Power Rankings, mostly because no team has taken the spot from them.

This win Tuesday was a prime example of that defensive improvement, as the Rockets blanketed Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard (14-for-35 combined shooting) to power an important, late-season road victory. Celtics 128, Warriors 95 \u2014 No team was more poised for a knockout punch to its playoff hopes than Boston was on Tuesday night. The Celtics entered this game with losses in five of their last six games \u2014 and then promptly got a 30-point game from beleaguered reserve Gordon Hayward. That gave the Warriors their worst loss of the season and an added measure of confidence to both Hayward and his team. Pistons 131, Wolves 114 \u2014 Don\u2019t look now, but Detroit is tied for the best record in the NBA since the All-Star break (8-1) . This win showed the Pistons are more than Blake Griffin\u2019s team, as Andre Drummond not only piled up numbers (31 points, 15 rebounds), but kept the ball moving, too, racking up 38 passes (third on the team that game behind Ish Smith and Griffin). Bulls 108, Sixers 107 \u2014 Teams bound for the 2019 Draft lottery \u2014 like Chicago is \u2014 have one role to fill this time of the year: playoff spoiler. Although this loss on Wednesday knock Philadelphia out of the East chase by any means, it will be on the Sixers may regret dropping in the weeks to come. As for the Bulls, it\u2019s another sign of life that, perhaps, Zach LaVine (39 points, game-winning layup) can be \u201cthe man.\u201d Celtics 111, Kings 109 \u2014 Two days after powering a rout in Oakland, Hayward was at it again \u2014 this time in Sacramento. He didn\u2019t have the same type of gaudy scoring stats. What he did provide, though, was the game-winning fade-away shot from the left side of the key to propel Boston to a win. That hero moment was a godsend for Hayward, who moments earlier committed the foul that allowed the Kings to tie the game up at the line. Nuggets 115, Lakers 99 \u2014 This Wednesday night affair was all about LeBron James, and rightfully so. He passed Michael Jordan for fourth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list in a moment that will last for years to come. For Denver, though, this was a show of resolve from a true title contender. Lesser teams might have gotten caught up in the moment and lost, but the Nuggets closed the door on that option early on. Thunder 129, Blazers 121 \u2014 Who says division rivalries are non-existent in today\u2019s NBA? Oklahoma City and Portland showed on Thursday there\u2019s no love lost between them as the Thunder swept the season series. However, this one came down to overtime and while Portland didn\u2019t score a win against OKC all season, no doubt the Thunder know they\u2019d get a tough series from them should they meet in the playoffs. Warriors 122, Nuggets 105 \u2014 For as much progress as Denver has made this season \u2014 and it has made a lot \u2014 it cannot seem to figure out Golden State when the opportunity presents itself. Once again, the defending champions made sure the No. 2 team in the West knew its place behind a barrage of first half buckets from Klay Thompson. Pistons 131, Bulls 108 \u2014 Is it time to attach the \u201cteam nobody wants to play in the first round\u201d prefix to the Pistons yet? Dominating the Bulls is no banner moment, of course. Yet Sunday\u2019s win showed Detroit is figuring things out as the season winds down \u2014 which can be the sign of a team ready to take a big leap once the playoff lights turn on. James Harden (35 points, 12-30 FG, 3 ast, 3 stl in 37 minutes) \u2014 The Rockets\u2019 superstar was at his scoring best when his team needed him most. Harden delivered 19 of those 35 points in the second half, helping Houston squash several of Toronto\u2019s attempts at a comeback in one of the Rockets\u2019 key road wins of the season. | Watch | Video box score Gordon Hayward (30 points, 12-16 FG, 4-6 3pt FG, 7 reb, 4 ast, 2 stl in 28 minutes) \u2014 Heading into this Tuesday night matchup with Golden State, the Celtics were at a decided low point. Thanks to Hayward, though, things perked up quickly. A blowout win of the defending champs gave both the Celtics and Hayward \u2014 who is still regaining his old, go-to guy form \u2014 a confidence boost. | Watch | Video box score Mike Conley (40 pts, 12-18 FG, 6-7 3pt FG, 4 reb, 4 ast in 35 minutes) \u2014 Ruining the fun for playoff-bound teams is one of the orders of the day for Memphis, and Conley saw to that on Tuesday night. His 40-point performance was his highest scoring game since dropping 38 points on the Suns in January of 2017. | Watch | Video box score Andre Drummond (31 points, 11-18 FG, 15 reb, 3 ast, 2 blk in 39 minutes) \u2014 Detroit\u2019s powerful center had it all working on Wednesday night and did so while outplaying his Minnesota counterpart, Karl-Anthony Towns. Drummond notched his 16th straight double-double \u2014 the second-longest run in team history \u2014 and helped Detroit move over .500 for the first time since Dec. 19. | Watch | Video box score  Damian Lillard (51 points, 15-28 FG, 18-20 FT, 5 reb, 9 ast, 2 blk in 47 minutes) \u2014 In what was his first 50-point game in more than a year, Lillard did all he could to try and get Portland to a win vs. OKC on Thursday night. It didn\u2019t work out, but you can\u2019t blame the Blazers\u2019 All-Star. He scored 15 in the fourth quarter to help force overtime and led the team with six points in the extra period. | Watch | Video box score Klay Thompson (39 pts, 13-22 FG, 9-11 3pt FG, 3 reb, 4 ast, 2 stl in 35 minutes) \u2014 Still smarting from a blowout home loss to the Boston Celtics, Thompson and Co. took it out on the Nuggets on Friday. He returned from a two-game absence to score 27 of his total points in the first half, going 9-for-13 overall with a 6-for-7 showing on 3-pointers. | Watch | Video box score Joel Embiid (33 points, 11-21 FG, 11-15 FT, 12 reb, 2 stl in 28 minutes) \u2013In his first game in nearly a month, Embiid showed the Pacers on Sunday why he\u2019s someone to fear come playoff time. This was a critical win for the Sixers, too, as they moved into a tie for the East\u2019s No. 3 spot with Indiana, but own the tiebreaker after winning the season series 3-1 on Sunday.

LeBron has always been a championship contender. Not to qualify for the playoffs is hard. I can only imagine.\u201d \u2014 Celtics guard Kyrie Irving , on LeBron James and the Lakers \u201cHe\u2019s been a very dominant player for a long time and on your way out it\u2019s easy to say, `I\u2019m going to ride this out and enjoy it.\u2019 But he\u2019s doing it like most Hall of Famers would do it \u2013 go at it and leave my greatness on the floor every night until you don\u2019t see it anymore.\u201d \u2014 Hawks guard Vince Carter , on Dwyane Wade \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t know plays, honestly. We\u2019ll call a play, and we\u2019re all looking like: \u2018I don\u2019t know where to go.\u2019 We\u2019re all trying to figure it out on the fly.\u201d \u2014 Grizzlies guard Mike Conley , on the team\u2019s changed roster \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find ways to win. I\u2019d rather have less stats and have more wins than to do what I\u2019ve been doing recently.\u201d \u2014 Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns \u201cIt looked to me like we were jogging up the floor. You can\u2019t play basketball jogging. You\u2019ve got to sprint. Your cuts have to be hard. You have to be going all out. We did not go all out and it was embarrassing.\u201d \u2014 Warriors coach Steve Kerr , after Tuesday\u2019s blowout loss to Boston \u201cThis one might take the crown, because there was a lot of body-to-body contact. \u2026 I had to look at it. I haven\u2019t jumped like that, probably, since high school.\u201d \u2014 Wizards guard Bradley Beal , after watching a replay of his dunk Wednesday night on the Mavs\u2019 Salah Mejri \u201cThey\u2019re a better team than we are.

The 115-111 defeat at Oracle Arena marked the Warriors\u2019 fourth loss in their last six games and, to guard Klay Thompson, the loss was the team\u2019s \u201cworst of the season\u201d. After the game, Thompson was calling for more energy from Warriors fans at Oracle Arena in this, the team\u2019s farewell season to the building. Next season, Golden State will play its game at the sparkling, new Chase Center located in San Francisco . Last night, the Warriors gave up a 16-point first-half lead and could not contain Devin Booker. He torched the Warriors for 37 points (on 13-for-23 shooting) and 11 rebounds in the Suns\u2019 win. \u201cIt\u2019s a long season,\u201d Thompson said, per ESPN\u2019s Nick Friedell . \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been playing a lot of basketball for five years now, so you\u2019re not going to be perfect for 82 games \u2014 we\u2019ve had too many missteps \u2014 but at the end of the day, that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve lost to that team in 19 games. So it\u2019s ugly but \u2026 I expect our crowd to be little more into it, too. Like, I know it\u2019s not the playoffs, but it is our last go-around at Oracle. Least you can stand up or something when we make a good play, especially in the beginning. We need that energy, especially this time of the year. It\u2019s hard to conjure up energy every single night \u2019cause you\u2019re looking forward to the playoffs and that run. \u201cSo we expect our fans to kind of bring that from the jump. \u2026 It\u2019s like us, though. You can\u2019t bring it every night, but still it helps. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re playing the Suns or the Bucks, whoever it is.

The Suns defeated Golden State for the first time since a 107-95 victory on Nov. 9, 2014, and earned their first road win in 20 tries against the Western Conference this season.

Indeed, about the only thing that slowed him down against the Indiana Pacers was foul trouble. Embiid otherwise did pretty much whatever he wanted, tuning up the Pacers\u2019 hapless frontcourt for 33 points, 15 free throws and 12 rebounds in just 27 minutes as the Sixers rolled to a 106-89 triumph . \u201cHe is a difference maker in all ways, shapes and forms,\u201d said coach Brett Brown, emphatic praise that somehow still almost sold Embiid short given the full extent of his dominance; the 7-footer notably scored 24 in the second half as the Sixers erased an eight-point halftime deficit . Embiid\u2019s return couldn\u2019t have come soon enough for the Sixers, who split their eight games without him and find themselves in a battle with the Pacers and the Boston Celtics for the third playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Sixers have only 15 regular-season games remaining, and nine of them on the road, so every win is key. And perhaps even more important than positioning? Developing the chemistry that has sometimes eluded the Sixers due to Embiid\u2019s injury and the in-season acquisitions of Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler. \u201cWe are on the clock,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe sense of urgency and awareness of where we are getting close to having to perform at is real for these players.\u201d Brown can at least comfort himself with the knowledge that \u2014 in the rare instances his full lineup has been available \u2014 it\u2019s been utterly dominant. Per ESPN research , the five-man unit of Embiid, Butler, Harris, Ben Simmons and JJ Redick has outscored opponents at a rate of 24 points per 100 possessions in 83 minutes together, compared to a minus-0.3 per 100 in 159 minutes without Embiid. Given that Embiid said he only felt better as the game wore on, that\u2019s bad, bad news for the rest of the East. A breakout for the Phoenix Suns! Roughly a week after pulling off one of the NBA\u2019s bigger upsets in recent decades with their victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, they did it again by stunning the Golden State Warriors 115-111 at Oracle Arena . Granted, they got a huge break with the right ankle contusion that sent Kevin Durant to the locker room for good with 6:34 remaining. But the Suns had played well up to that point, even leading for most of the third quarter before the Warriors fought back to tie things up at 91 when Durant left. The Warriors led by one several minutes later, just before the Suns ripped off a 12-0 run, fueled by nine points from Devin Booker and capped by Kelly Oubre\u2019s no-no-no-YES!!! 3-pointer . It was 1-on-5 when Oubre, a career 32-percent shooter on 3s, let fly with 18 seconds left on the shot clock. But as the Romans used to say, fortune favors the bold. The Warriors, who entered as 17-point favorites and led by 16 in the first quarter, made their inevitable run. But the Suns held firm, snapping an 18-game losing streak to the Warriors dating back to November 2014. One of the most captivating aspects of the NBA is the freakish athleticism we\u2019re treated to on a nightly basis, and Sunday delivered in spades with a pair of truly ridiculous alley-oops from Miami\u2019s Derrick Jones Jr. and Atlanta\u2019s John Collins. Neither were served with very good passes. But when you can jump and catch like these two, accuracy is but a luxury. Jones: Collins: A nine-time All-Defensive selection, Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul is used to making game-changing plays on the ugly end of the floor. But that usually involves steals and tenacity rather than blocked shots. Indeed, the future Hall of Famer entered his 935th career regular-season game with just 116 blocks, an average of 0.1 per. So, with Sunday\u2019s game against the Dallas Mavericks on the line, of course Paul stepped up to deny Jalen Brunson\u2019s jumper at the buzzer and preserve a 94-93 victory for the Rockets. https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoustonRockets\/status\/1104916183902445570 It was a fitting finish to a big day for Paul, who also surpassed Isiah Thomas for seventh on the NBA\u2019s career assists list . It was impossible to tell who was more shocked at Klay Thompson\u2019s wraparound slam against the Suns, his teammates or the man himself. Either way, the reactions were entirely justified given that this was just Thompson\u2019s 20th dunk out of 548 total field goals this season. Bats continued their decade-long invasion of the AT&T Center with the latest in a long line of court incursions during the Spurs\u2019 121-114 conquest of the Milwaukee Bucks. Which couldn\u2019t have been more perfect given that Bucks center Brook Lopez, a noted comic book geek, has said he\u2019d \u201cabsolutely\u201d let a bat bite him if given the chance, disease and infection be damned. As he told SB Nation in February: But it\u2019s that other 25 percent, Brook. According to Live Science, bats can carry more than 60 human-infecting viruses, including ebola and salmonella. Which is why teammate Eric Bledsoe couldn\u2019t have gotten out of the way fast enough, and lived to tell the tale.

By locking up Bledsoe early, Milwaukee kept the muscled, two-way point guard off the free agent market this summer. The Bucks still have multiple players from their core nearing the end of their current deals \u2014 Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Malcolm Brogdon, Nikola Mirotic \u2014 so nailing down at least one of the key puzzle pieces around MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo eases at least a little uncertainty for what comes after this happy 2018-19 season and postseason. They also lessened the downside by reportedly guaranteeing only $3.9 million of the $19 million due Bledsoe in the last year of the deal. Then again, the Bucks bid against no one in signing Bledsoe now rather than later. They committed to a guard who will be 32 in the final season of the extension, a guy who has helped his teams to just one playoff series in the past five seasons. In setting their own market for Bledsoe four months early, Milwaukee essentially traded one risk \u2014 losing the player without compensation in July \u2014 for another. Which seems to be happening a lot around the NBA these days. Maybe it\u2019s Cleveland and forward Kevin Love jumping at a four-year, $120 million extension last summer, a deal that won\u2019t start until next fall for a player who has missed 53 games this season and an average of more than 25 per season since he joined the Cavaliers in 2014. Or maybe it\u2019s Minnesota doing the same thing with Andrew Wiggins, rushing to give the never-All-Star a five-year , $146 million extension in October 2017.  It\u2019s bad enough that Love\u2019s $24 million salary, even if he\u2019s healthy for the remainder of the Cavs\u2019 schedule, annualizes out to $66 million for the games he\u2019ll actually play. No surprise that a 30-year-old veteran in his 11th season, with his history of injuries and ailments, would jump at the chance to guarantee early what might be his final (at least final big) NBA payday. Love at least is a five-time All-Star and affable personality who, at his best, is worthy of planting a flag with for a franchise in serious transition after LeBron James left last summer. It\u2019s worse that Wiggins\u2019 massive deal, for a player whose intensity and desire to fully tap his many skills has been suspect for years, looked like a mistake well before it kicked in for this season. If ever a player seemed to need the urgency of an open market \u2014 as a restricted free agent, still in Minnesota\u2019s control had he even reached that status last summer \u2014 it\u2019s Wiggins. Unless you think it\u2019s a good idea to purchase luxury cars with missing motors. Now consider Washington\u2019s John Wall, whose ruptured Achilles tendon likely will keep him out until deep into next season. That, finally, will be Year 1 of the four-year, $170 million max extension the Wizards signed with him back in July 2017. They assumed 100 percent of the risk, giving Wall a player option for the final 2022-23 season. Granted, he has been their best player for most of his NBA tenure, that essential piece in their, um, early eliminations and playoff misses. Now there\u2019s genuine concern that the quickness that literally has separated him from most of his peers might be gone to injury and surgery. What isn\u2019t gone is the contract obligation Washington faces. Sometimes, admittedly, these pre-emptive strikes work out nicely. The four-year, $100 million (that is, less than maximum) package the Bucks gave Antetokounmpo is a relative steal \u2014 and sets a bar for what other Milwaukee players, such as Middleton, might think about making, in terms of drawing a bigger salary than the team\u2019s essential talent. Blake Griffin\u2019s five-year, $173 million deal signed with the Clippers as a free agent in 2017 became Detroit\u2019s burden entirely when they traded for the All-Star forward. Fortunately for the Pistons, Griffin\u2019s game has grown in the interim, making the dollar amounts ($39 million in 2021-22 when he hits age 33) appear less onerous. Jumping the gun \u2014 out of a fear of losing players outright \u2014 is one thing. Getting out over one\u2019s skis to pre-empt restrictive free agency is an even shakier strategy. Portland did it with players, stuck because their departures wouldn\u2019t have opened up enough cap space to compete in the market otherwise. But who looks smarter now: Chicago for being \u201cpassive\u201d and matching the four-year, $78 million offer sheet Zach LaVine signed with Sacramento or Minnesota owner Glen Taylor for looking deep into Wiggins\u2019 eyes (that was a prerequisite for the Wolves boss) before handing over all that dough for still untapped potential? These tactics have been further complicated by the recent trend of some NBA stars \u2014 cornerstone players to whom franchises either had or would have committed their futures \u2014 to fuss and buck with time left on the fat contracts they receive.  Notice the escalation from Paul George serving notice in Indiana that he planned to leave to Kyrie Irving wanting a trade away from Cleveland, followed by Jimmy Butler undermining the Timberwolves at the start of this season to leverage his trade to Philadelphia, finally to Anthony Davis demanding out of New Orleans as the February trade deadline neared \u2014 with 1.5 seasons left on his Pelicans deal. The NBA long has been a supporter of players\u2019 movement when they reach free agency and have the same freedom to choose whatever employer, colleagues, geography or professional ambitions suit them. But while upholding their end of a bargain into which they willingly entered? Nope. It\u2019s an unforeseen consequence of the owners, in the most recent collective-bargaining talks, preferring shorter contracts as a way to protect against under performance and debilitating injuries (think Chicago\u2019s Derrick Rose). Now, with four-year contracts turned into two-, it\u2019s something that goes bump in the night to keep commissioner Adam Silver tossing and turning. No one questions the business strategy when it works; so far, Russell Westbrook\u2019s five-year, $205 million extension, signed in 2017, appears to have been a solid move. It essentially kept both him and George in Oklahoma City. But there are matching examples, a miscalculation for every success, throughout the league. And in between the two rules of free agency \u2014 \u201cnever let a star leave for nothing in return\u201d and \u201cnever bid against yourself\u201d \u2014 there is this enduring one: You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Lakers announced their decision on the former No. 2 overall draft pick Saturday. Ingram has missed the Lakers\u2019 past two games after he reported shoulder pain following a morning shootaround last Monday. Lakers coach Luke Walton said earlier this week that Ingram had pain whenever he attempted to lift his arm. A deep venous thrombosis is a condition caused by a blood clot, frequently accompanied by swelling and pain in a limb. The condition usually occurs in legs, but can occur in the upper body. Blood clots have affected several prominent athletes including Chris Bosh and Serena Williams in recent years. Bosh eventually retired due to blood clotting issues, but many other athletes have continued to play. Ingram is averaging a career-best 18.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game along with 3.0 assists.  The lanky swingman\u2019s chemistry with LeBron James has improved markedly over the course of the season despite several weeks of trade rumors linking Ingram and the rest of the Lakers\u2019 top young players to a deal for New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis. Ingram particularly excelled after the All-Star break and the trade deadline, averaging 27.8 points in his six most recent games. But injuries have played a major role in preventing the Lakers from developing any consistency during James\u2019 first season alongside their young core. Los Angeles might be without Lonzo Ball for the rest of the season due to a sprained ankle. Ball hasn\u2019t played since Jan. 19, and Walton said Friday that the point guard is \u201cnot close\u201d to returning despite an initial diagnosis of his injury suggesting he would be back by now. Kyle Kuzma, the Lakers\u2019 second-leading scorer with 18.8 points per game, also is out this week with a sprained ankle. The Lakers (30-35) are in 10th place in the Western Conference heading into their rivalry meeting with Boston on Saturday night.

Despite the Lakers\u2019 woes, he hasn\u2019t missed a beat, managing to pour in 24 or more points in eight straight. During that span, James has notched 10 or more assists five times and eight more boards four times. 2. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 7 games, 19.6 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 5.9 apg Season stats: 19.8 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 5.4 apg Absent are the 30-point offerings, with the last one coming Feb. 13 \u2014 a span of eight games. In fact, Williams has gone for 20 or more just three times in the last seven games. So why hasn\u2019t he taken a tumble? Because he\u2019s still scored 17 or more in every game, despite some rather ugly shooting numbers (36.2 FG% and 23.5 3PT%). 2a. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 3 Latest stats:  7 games, 22.1 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Season stats: 21.1 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 2.4 apg Aldridge\u2019s 32-point outing Wednesday against the Hawks propelled him into a tie with Williams for the No. 2 slot. In addition to that performance, Aldridge went over 20 points in four of the other six games. Yes, we can\u2019t overlook his six-point showing on Feb. 22 that started the stint, but he rebounded very nicely, shooting 54.4 from the field for the seven games. 4. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 6 games, 17.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 7.8 apg Season stats: 14.7 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 9.0 apg It was a bit of a roller coaster stint for Lowry. There was his excellent 35-point performance against the Pistons. There were the three solid outings in which he put up between 17-19 points and 10 assists twice. And there was the two forgettable games where he scored less than 10 points, shooting a combined 27.2 FG% and 11.1 3PT%. 5. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 7 Latest stats: 6 games, 15.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 10.2 apg Season stats: 15.8 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 8.3 apg Paul started off supremely strong with 23 points and 17 assists in a win over the Warriors. He left a bad taste in our mouth with his most recent showing of five points on 1-for-10 shooting. In between, however, there was a lot to like: three games of 15 or more points, three games of 10 or more assists. 6. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 6 games, 13.7 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 18.0 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.7 apg The streak is dead. After 56 consecutive games with double-figure scoring, Redick managed just seven (1-for-10 shooting) in a loss to the Trail Blazers. Adding to the misery, he scored just six last Saturday against the Warriors. In his last six games, Redick is shooting just 32.0 FG% and 32.6 3PT% \u2014 and that\u2019s including Tuesday\u2019s showing in which he went 8-for-16 and 6-for-9 from deep. 7. Paul Millsap (34), Denver Nuggets Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 7 games, 14.6 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 1.7 apg Season stats: 12.5 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 1.9 apg Millsap started strong, posting three straight double-doubles. He followed that up with two games of 15 or more points. A five-point showing on Monday slowed things, but he bounced right back with 16 and eight on Wednesday against the Lakers. Over the seven games, Millsap shot a respectable 48.1 from the field and 34.8 from deep. For good measure, he added 2.1 steals and 1.1 blocks. 8. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Previous rank: 8 Latest stats: 7 games, 14.7 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 4.1 apg Season stats: 13.1 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 4.0 apg Horford went for 18 or more points in four of seven games, shooting a blistering 58.9 percent from the field. Yes, he did have two single-digit scoring games, but the other five games were strong enough to hold his position. In addition to the scoring, Horford managed five or more rebounds in four games and five or more assists in three. 9. Trevor Ariza (33), Washington Wizards Previous rank: 9 Latest stats: 6 games, 14.2 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 4.0 apg Season stats: 12.9 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 3.9 apg There was a bit of symmetry in Ariza\u2019s last six games: three good showings (16 points, 22 and 23) and three bad (six, eight and 10). But what really stood out was the win-loss splits. In three wins, Ariza averaged 20.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 51.4 FG%. In three losses, he averaged just 8.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 30.3 FG%. 10. Jeff Green (32), Washington Wizards Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 6 games, 13.2 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 1.3 apg Season stats: 12.5 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 2.0 apg If not for last a four-point effort on Feb. 23 against the Pacers, Green would\u2019ve climbed up another spot or two. That\u2019s because in the other five games, he scored between 13-16 in all of them while shooting better than 50 percent from the field in four games. With that said, we\u2019d like to see more board work since he\u2019s failed to grab more than five in six straight.

It isn\u2019t as new and shiny as it was four years ago. It even sports some pesky potholes that need to be filled, patted down, and, if necessary, fixed again. But it\u2019s still the same road, and that road goes through Golden State. Denver found out as much on Friday in a clash of the West\u2019s best . The Warriors quenched any early drama by opening the game with a 15-3 onslaught. The defending champs\u2019 third option (Klay Thompson) had 27 points by halftime. Denver didn\u2019t get a third scorer in double figures until 5:01 remained in the fourth quarter. Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and DeMarcus Cousins absolutely swarmed the younger Nuggets on defense, forcing them into a putrid 37.9-percent shooting performance. Even after being initially overwhelmed, a brief moment of intrigue bloomed. Denver clawed their way within eight late in the third quarter, the Nuggets\u2019 key contributors stepping up while the Warriors endured a stretch of Kevin Durant misses and untimely turnovers. Then, like the video game team they have become, the Warriors flipped to Hall of Fame mode. Durant and-one. Kevon Looney dunk. Stephen Curry bomb. Game over. No one is confusing these Warriors with the 2014-15 storm that swept the league. Or the 73-win regular-season juggernaut. Or even the year 1 A.D. (after Durant). They already carry 20 losses well before reaching 50 wins. Their point differential is plus-5.8. Those are the marks of a really good team. Not a great one. Those are also regular-season marks, achievements the back-to-back champs lightly regard. But when the pot merits their full attention, when the stakes actually matter \u2014 and it kind of mattered against the West\u2019s second-best team, one which entered just one game back in the standings \u2014 the Warriors become the Warriors. That team? No one has found an answer for that. Not yet. Everyone pegged the wrong Los Angeles ball club to reach the postseason, and yeah, the Clippers are loving it. More than that, they\u2019re earning it, even after trading arguably their most All-Star worthy player (Tobias Harris) before the deadline. Hasn\u2019t mattered, largely because the Clippers rank a stingy seventh on defense since the trade. Meanwhile, their offense (16th) has been just good enough to keep up with \u2014 and beat \u2014 teams like the Thunder, whom they held off 118-110 on Friday. With Harris gone, Lou Williams has re-donned his super sixth man cape. Since Harris was shipped to Philadelphia, Williams has been averaging 23.1 points, 5.7 assists and 1.2 steals in just 28.2 minutes per game. His 40-point performance against the Thunder marked his 28th career game with 30 or more off the bench \u2014 a new NBA record . The Clippers have further buffered Harris\u2019 departure with an unexpected spike in production from Montrezl Harrell, who has erupted for 18.2 points per game on 61.1 percent shooting since the trade. Now LA finds itself just percentage points out of sixth place in the West. Whether they overtake Utah for that spot or not, the Clippers have a coin flip\u2019s chance of facing a familiar face in round one: Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets. Lift your heads, perimeter defenders. After months of searching, hope has been found in defending James Harden\u2019s unguardable step-back 3-pointer. If you\u2019re 6-foot-10, boast a 7-foot wingspan and employ the quickness of Kemba Walker, you too can block the Beard. In starting alongside Jonas Valanciunas, Joakim Noah made his first NBA start since Feb. 4, 2017. The former Kia Defensive Player of the Year played a solid role (seven points, eight rebounds, four assists, two blocks) in Memphis\u2019 surprising 114-104 win over Utah. Jabari Parker got away with a minor spine-tingler on this post-whistle attempt. You might not be so lucky with your flimsy plastic hoop. Andre Drummond reinforced his reputation as arguably the best rebounder of this NBA generation, amassing 20 points and 24 boards in Detroit\u2019s 112-104 win over the Bulls. What he did not do is inspire Pistons coach Dwane Casey to draw up 3-point plays."},{"id":35078,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-exum-return-practice","date":"2019-03-09","title":"Dante Exum (ankle) to return to practice this week","content":" SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 Jazz guard Dant\u00e9 Exum was reexamined by the Utah Jazz medical staff on Friday and the following was determined: Exum continues to make progress towards a return and is listed as out tonight with a left ankle sprain and an accompanying bone bruise, but plans to return to practice this week.

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry dropped in on a television interview to surprise a 9-year-old girl who helped design the inside of the latest version of the Golden State Warriors star\u2019s signature shoe. Riley Morrison of Napa, California, was doing an interview Friday on CBS about the shoes and Curry when he walked in. He gave her a pair of the new shoes and rebounded for her while she shot baskets. Riley was invited to help design the Curry 6 model after she initially wrote to tell him she couldn\u2019t buy his Curry 5 shoes because they weren\u2019t available for girls on the Under Armour website. They were only marketed to boys. The two-time MVP and five-time All-Star replied with an apology, saying in a handwritten response that he\u2019s been working with the company to remedy the situation.

Their hair is pulled tight, their uniforms are buttoned down. And the 100-yard stares they\u2019ve developed serve them well when some critic or comedian in the stands gets a little too boisterous. As first-year NBA referees, they\u2019re all about the job. As first-year female NBA refs, they know they\u2019d better be. But then a coach calls a timeout, everybody exhales and the reality of where they are and what they\u2019re doing hits both of them. If not for the whistles clenched between their teeth, you might even see them smile. \u201cI don\u2019t find it intimidating at all,\u201d Sago, 29, said recently about the big stage on which she\u2019s working this season, after climbing the referees\u2019 ladder from high school to college to G League games. \u201cI love it. It really gets me going. It starts with the starting lineups, they turn the lights off and get the flames going. And during the game, when the home team goes on a run, everybody\u2019s on their feet. And I\u2019m like, \u2018This is awesome.\u2019  \u201cI\u2019m a big banners girl. During a timeout, I love looking at all the banners, all the history. You let it all soak in. I love the arenas, the fans. It fuels me. Bring it on. I want more.\u201d Said Moyer-Gleich, whose career timeline has paralleled Sago\u2019s: \u201cThese four months have been incredible. So much more special than I ever thought it would be. Growing up playing basketball, I\u2019d been a gym rat, all day, every day for most of my 31 years. But walking into those NBA arenas and putting on my uniform and standing on the court when fans are piling in \u2026 even 25 games in, it makes my heart flutter so much. How blessed am I that this is my job?\u201d Both got the call in November from Michelle Johnson, senior vice president and head of referee operations. Along with Mousa Dagher , Matt Myers and Phenizee Ransom , Sago and Moyer-Gleich were among the five G League referees promoted to full-time NBA status. Brandon Adair already had been added, giving the league six first-year refs for 2018-19. So far, the \u201crookies\u201d have done about as well as expected, an encouraging sign and a demonstration that the NBA\u2019s budding minor league can be a reliable proving ground not just for players and coaches but for game officials as well.  \u201cOur coaching feedback has been positive,\u201d said Monty McCutchen, VP and head of referee development and training. \u201cYour first year in the NBA, regardless of your gender, it can be a difficult league to gain acceptance in. We understand and take sort of a long view toward the growth of our officials. What our organizations and coaches and players want is accuracy and will and strength and courage. As we are finding out in many facets of life, those characteristics of life are not gender-specific.  \u201cWe recognized the need for the pipeline to grow in this way. Natalie and Ashley have shown the proper skill set, along with the intestinal fortitude, to take this next step. I\u2019m hopeful that in a very few years it won\u2019t seem out of place, it won\u2019t seem special.\u201d McCutchen wants people to know that \u2014 as \u201cprogressive\u201d as the NBA\u2019s reputation is, and as willing to lead the way among major sports leagues in trends and social issues \u2014 Sago and Moyer-Gleich got this opportunity on merit. They are the fourth and fifth female referees in NBA history, following in the footsteps of Dee Kantner (1997-2002), Violet Palmer (1997-2016) and still-active Lauren Holtkamp , 38. \u201cAshley and Natalie both earned their spots because they were among the best available for the spots that were open,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cThey happened to be women. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit here and talk about a program of integrity, and then turn around and not honor what it would mean to hire the best officials. I don\u2019t want to be a part of that.\u201d With Holtkamp still rehabbing after suffering a knee injury last spring, Sago and Moyer-Gleich are conspicuous on NBA courts for obvious reasons. But their experiences, like their reception by an overwhelming majority of players and coaches, have been almost by-the-book what newbie refs get regardless of gender. This is, after all, 2019, not 1999 or 1979 or 1959. Neither spoke of any resistance related to being female. Quite the opposite in some cases, in fact.  \u201cIt\u2019s really neat when some of the players come up during warmups, shake your hand and say, \u2018Welcome to the league,\u2019 \u201d Sago said. \u201cThat means a lot. It\u2019s a stepping stone to have that player-referee communication. Just to get that started, talking and communicating with players, makes me comfortable that, \u2018Hey, I can probably talk to this guy throughout the game.\u2019 That\u2019s really nice. \u201cThe coaches have welcomed me. Those might be more heated interactions throughout my career and I\u2019ve expected that and been ready for that. But so far everything\u2019s been good. Lots of learning and growing moments, which is the beauty of this job.\u201d  Both Sage and Moyer-Gleich advanced last season to the G League\u2019s \u201cenhanced\u201d program for referees. That guarantees them work in at least 50 games, carrying a monthly stipend that serves as \u201csalary\u201d compared to the per-game compensation they get piecing together schedules of G League and NCAA games. They both still work a few games each month in the minor league, serving as crew chiefs there and mentoring even less experienced officials who are vying for similar careers. As of late February, each had worked about 20 NBA games this season and seven or eight in the G League. Sago, from Farmington, Mo., got her start as an amateur athlete whose father was refereed high school basketball. He would take her along to his games, and her window into the NBA began as someone who watched the refs as much as most fans focus on the players. She has pinch-me moments now feeling like a peer to veteran officials such as Mike (Duke) Callahan or Ken Mauer whom she used to notice on TV. Moyer-Gleich, from Harrisburg, Pa., led her Millersville University team to the Division II \u201cSweet 16\u201d in 2010 before working five years of high school games in Pennsylvania. She was an adjunct professor at Messiah College teaching a sports-wellness course when talent scouts for the NBA\u2019s officiating program noticed and sought her out.  That was her door into the career she cherishes now, one supported and easily understood by her husband Johnee Gleich, who referees men\u2019s NCAA games . As with Sago, the next bit of pushback will be her first. Whether withstanding an in-the-moment critique from San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich or telling Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green exactly why she called what she called, Moyer-Gleich hasn\u2019t had to flinch. \u201cThe players have been fantastic. The coaches have been fantastic,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one has said anything derogatory in any way about being a female. I\u2019ve had several players come up to me saying, \u2018It\u2019s about time. I have daughters\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a testament to our league and the players we have to be so professional, and accepting and open. \u201cI\u2019m sure at some point the honeymoon will be over. It will wear off when there are tough games and tough plays, but that\u2019s part of our jobs. But for the first four months, they have been amazing.\u201d Chicago Bulls coach Jim Boylen has had both women work his team\u2019s games. He\u2019s a coaching lifer who came across stylistically as part throwback, part dinosaur when he replaced Fred Hoiberg earlier this season. But not in this area. \u201cThey\u2019re both excellent young officials,\u201d Boylen said. \u201cGreat attitudes and work ethics and eye contact. And toughness. You can get on \u2018em and they take it.  \u201cI don\u2019t think gender plays a role at all. It\u2019s basketball, y\u2019know? I see an official out there and I respect that. I know that person has worked their ass off to get here, just as we all have.\u201d Boylen did admit to one gaffe involving the two newcomers. \u201cI\u2019ve called them the wrong name,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI called Ashley \u2018Natalie\u2019 and Natalie \u2018Ashley.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s OK, though. Sago said, for example, when asking a player to tuck in his jersey, she\u2019ll hear a reflexive \u201cYes sir\u201d occasionally. \u201cI\u2019m always around the guys. It doesn\u2019t hurt my feelings,\u201d she said. The logistics of accommodating female referees is old news for the NBA, with dressing rooms and privacy readily available in the wake of Kantner, Palmer and Holtkamp. It\u2019s a pretty enlightened group of colleagues, too, to hear the two tell it. \u201cWe\u2019re new hires,\u201d Moyer-Gleich said, \u201cand a lot of the guys probably feel a little protective over us, whether it\u2019s in a sister way or a daughter way. Guys who we didn\u2019t have a relationship with went out of their way at the start to text me after games saying \u2018Good job\u2019 with this or that. It makes you feel a sense of \u2018I belong here.\u2019 And that perception, if that\u2019s the aura you\u2019re giving off, the players and the coaches will buy into that.\u201d There are no special rules regarding physical skirmishes between players, either. \u201cReally, it comes down to safety,\u201d Moyer-Gleich said. \u201cI had a scrum in December with the Bulls and OKC. It\u2019s scary \u2014 these are big guys, so me trying to separate them is not going to do too much. But I also feel when players hear a female\u2019s voice, sometimes that calms them down a little bit.\u201d It\u2019s the same, too, when the heat is restricted to verbal exchanges. Sago considers herself a \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d So even if the goal is for men and women referees to be essentially interchangeable, she wonders if a little less testosterone in the moment can have some benefit. \u201cSome males, they go right back at [a player or coach]. They want to go head-to-head sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like, being female, we can defuse things a little easier and quicker.\u201d Ultimately, the story of Sago\u2019s and Moyer-Gleich\u2019s first NBA seasons is little different from any of the other rookie refs. Same stripes, same whistles, same orientation process to the speed, skills, arenas, travel, personalities and oversight that\u2019s as rigorous as anything air-traffic controllers face. The proof mostly is in the reffing, where it should be. As for feeling like pioneers here in 2019? \u201cWe were so lucky to have Violet and Dee and Lauren pave the way,\u201d Moyer-Gleich said. \u201cFor this next generation where having female referees in men\u2019s games won\u2019t be a shock, they may consider us pioneers. I don\u2019t, [but] I definitely want to inspire the next generation of females and leave a legacy.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It\u2019s not something most in the NBA ponder during the intense heat of a late-season playoff push . Everything is compartmentalized. You\u2019re trying to win the next possession, the next quarter, the next game. Anything beyond what\u2019s right in front of you cannot claim your focus. The Draft lottery, the playoffs, awards season, the 2019 Draft , free agency \u2026 everything has its time and place on the NBA calendar. But what if we looked into the future, and not to just the summer of 2019, but three, four or five years from now? What does the landscape look like? Who takes over for the current generation of superstars? Are they even on our radar right now? I posed those questions to two NBA executives, one from each conference, two advance scouts and one college scout in search of a picture of what the future of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder might look like five years from now. Surely, we\u2019ll have some familiar faces, current stars entering the primes of their careers who will no doubt remain relevant in the MVP conversation. Guys like Giannis Antentokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons \u2013 all leaders of the new school of superstars. But who are the budding superstars with the right combination of star power and status \u2013 i.e., guys on teams whose team success could accelerate things \u2013 and quickly rise the Kia MVP ranks? Here are the five players who garnered the most mention from our future MVP panel: Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz: An undersized but powerful dynamo, Mitchell\u2019s uniquely positioned to make the move into the MVP ranks in the future. That\u2019s based as much on his own individual brilliance and offensive skill as it is his headlining a team that could be a contender soon. \u201cHe\u2019s got a skill-set that will allow him to be a high-level dictator of outcomes for his team on a regular basis,\u201d said an Eastern Conference executive. \u201cGo back and look at the way he played against [Houston] in the playoffs last season. That\u2019s what MVP candidates in our league do when the lights are brightest. He went toe-to-toe with James [Harden] in that series as a rookie. The better shooter he becomes, the more difficult he\u2019ll be to stop. Because he\u2019s already a nightmare matchup because he plays so much bigger than his actual size. His competitive drive is off the charts and the framework they\u2019ve provided in Utah is rock-solid. He\u2019s a great fit there.\u201d Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks:  He knows a little something about this MVP business, having already earned some serious hardware before his breakout rookie season with the Mavericks. But how will he and Kristaps Porzingis fit in the coming years? And will he continue to thrive with another elite young talent requiring the ball to be effective? \u201cThe thing about his game that sets him apart is that he\u2019s got the skills to be just as good on or off the ball,\u201d a Western Conference advance scout said. \u201cIf he was just a scorer and had to survive on that alone, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019d be nearly as dangerous. He\u2019s going to be a triple-double threat with his size, playmaking ability and feel for the game. He came in with a polish that takes years for some guys to put on their game, if they ever do. But it all depends on the chemistry he and KP develop. If it works, he\u2019ll be a monster for years to come.\u201d Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics:  The talent logjam in Boston could be alleviated this summer, via trades and\/or free agency, giving Tatum a clear path to assume the superstar role some think he\u2019s destined for with the Celtics. That is, of course, if he\u2019s not a part of the offseason player movement. \u201cI\u2019ve pounded the table about this for years, since I first scouted him at Duke. He has the most translatable offensive skill-set for the league of any prospect I\u2019ve scouted the past five years,\u201d said a college scout for an Eastern Conference team. \u201cYou either have the physical tools or you don\u2019t. The size, the basketball IQ and the understanding of how to attack his defender \u2026 he\u2019s got advanced level stuff in that regard. KD [Kevin Durant] was the same way at roughly this same stage of his career and drove himself to greatness with a work ethic that\u2019s second to none. If Tatum has that same kind of drive in him \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if he does, but I\u2019ve heard great things about the kid \u2014 he\u2019s your guy.\u201d De\u2019Aaron Fox, Sacramento Kings:  Fox is the pilot for a Sacramento team that could be ready for takeoff in the next season or two and the best two-way player on this list. He\u2019s also one of the fastest players in the league and an underrated athlete who has already shown signs of 20-10 potential. \u201cI love him. Absolutely love his game and how hard he goes,\u201d said a Western Conference executive. \u201cEnd to end, he\u2019s got the kind of acceleration that only a couple of guys in the league can match, like Russ [Westbrook] and John [Wall] showed early on. That\u2019s sort of speed, and the ability to control games with tempo, is a game changer when utilized properly. He\u2019s a much better shooter now than I thought possible after seeing him as a rookie. But he\u2019s worked at it. He\u2019s got so much room to grow, physically and just his game overall. And he\u2019s already a guy you have to account for when you prepare for the Kings. Like I said, I love the kid. He just plays with the right spirit.\u201d Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks:  Those lofty Stephen Curry comparisons that accompanied Young into the league seemed so far-fetched early on this season, when the rookie point guard struggled with his shot and his niche. His late-season surge of high-scoring, high-assist performances has added some credence to the idea that Young could be the leader of a Warriors-inspired revival in Atlanta. \u201cIt was easy to take advantage of him early on because he wasn\u2019t strong enough to do much of anything against guys at his position,\u201d an Eastern Conference advance scout said. \u201cTo his credit, he figured out how to create situations he could take advantage of to get it done. I still cringe at some of the shots he takes. But, and hear me out on this, his best skill isn\u2019t his shooting. The thing that will make him is his ability to drill you in the pick and roll with his passing. He masters that and his shooting, his ability to generate offense for himself and his team goes off the charts. I think he\u2019s a next-level passer more than anything. To me, that\u2019s what sets his game apart.\u201d * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.1 points, 12.6 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.4 blocks In Thursday night\u2019s rout of the Indiana Pacers , Antetokounmpo reminded anyone that hasn\u2019t paid close attention just how difficult it will be to deal with his Bucks at home in the playoffs. His supporting cast is filled with shooters who possess the length and athleticism to accentuate all that he brings in coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s attack. Any lingering doubts about the Bucks\u2019 validity as the league\u2019s best team this (regular) season should have been silenced weeks ago. Antetokounmpo\u2019s been good enough on his own to inspire Bucks fans to dream big in regards to what this season can bring. The in-season additions of both Nikola Mirotic and now Pau Gasol have fortified the roster with even more length, shooting and championship-level seasoning. \u201cThe Greek Freak,\u201d fellow All-Star Khris Middleton, Malcolm Brogdon and Eric Bledsoe are providing the frontline star power needed to power any team harboring championship ambitions. It\u2019s clear that the Bucks fancy themselves a championship-ready outfit, given their willingness to go all-in for 2018-19. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  36.7 points, 7.5 assists, 6.5 rebounds, 2.2 steals Harden shows no signs of letting up, which works for both his MVP candidacy as well as the Rockets\u2019 goal of climbing as high as they can in the West. Harden\u2019s special season continues with a Friday night visit from the Philadelphia 76ers ( 8 ET, ESPN ), yet another showcase opportunity for the reigning Kia MVP against an elite East opponent. Harden dials up some of his best for the biggest games. And the Rockets are measuring themselves against all of the other contenders down the stretch. The Sixers\u2019 size and length will provide some intriguing challenges for Harden, who is scoring at a slightly higher clip ( 37.2 ppg ) since the All-Star break than he was before it ( 36.6 ppg ). The Miami Heat (58 points), Boston Celtics (42) and Toronto Raptors (35) have all found out just how difficult it is to deal with Harden recently. The Rockets\u2019 enter the weekend with the league\u2019s longest current win streak (six games), but more importantly with the momentum that has propelled them just outside the top three in the West. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.6 points 8.1 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 2.3 steals George is still trying to work his way back into a groove after missing three straight games with that sore right shoulder. He\u2019s struggled with his shot (15-for-48 from the floor, 5-for-24 from deep) in his two games back but has rescued himself with a sparkling effort from the foul line (23-for-27). His all-around work in the Thunder\u2019s overtime win in Portland on Thursday , however, is the true measure of what George consistently brings to OKC. His 32 points, 14 rebounds, six assists and three steals in 43 minutes were critical as he and Russell Westbrook (37 points, seven rebounds and three assists) offset a monstrous 51-point night from Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard . George and the Thunder will keep Lillard and the Blazers (along with Harden and the Rockets as well) in their sights as they continue to jockey for the No. 3 spot. As long as George keeps up his elite-level work on both ends of the floor, the Thunder should be considered a true to threat in the West. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  28.3 points, 5.2 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.3 steals Curry and the Warriors are in a strange place for a two-time defending champion that sits atop the West heading into tonight\u2019s matchup against Denver ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). They actually appear to be vulnerable, having lost three of their last four games. In fact, the Warriors have suffered the worst home loss of the Steve Kerr era against Boston Tuesday night . That\u2019s why you should expect to see Curry and Co. at their best against a Nuggets team that presents a direct challenge to their hold on the No. 1 spot out West. Whatever issues the Warriors have now, there is plenty of time to fix them between now and the playoffs. Curry\u2019s own assessment \u2014 that the Warriors are \u201cstruggling\u201d only in the context of the extremely lofty expectations they have for themselves \u2014 makes perfect sense. The Warriors have had to play against themselves in theory the past few seasons. The Rockets provided external pressure last season, both in taking the No. 1 spot out West and in hosting the West finals. If the memory of facing a 3-2 deficit and having to win Game 7 on the road isn\u2019t motivation enough, perhaps a late-season race with the Nuggets will do the trick this time for Curry\u2019s crew. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  20.5 points, 10.8 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.4 steals It\u2019s showdown time for Jokic and the Nuggets, who face the Warriors at Oracle Arena tonight. If the Nuggets are serious about owning the West\u2019s No. 1 spot, then there\u2019s no better time to make that statement. The Nuggets lost three straight before Wednesday\u2019s win against the Los Angeles Lakers . A head-to-head win over the Warriors not only bolsters the case for the No. 1 spot, it also provides some confidence for any potential playoff matchup. Jokic, of course, is plenty confident in himself during what is truly a breakout season. The fourth-year big man is not only in the thick of the MVP chase, but is also on course to post career highs in several categories . He\u2019s also a lock for All-NBA honors, and could be a first-team selection. The timing couldn\u2019t have been better for Nuggets coach Mike Malone. He needed someone to serve as the backbone for what he was building in Denver \u2026 and he found it in Jokic. * * * 6. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 7.

Russell Westbrook had 37 points and Paul George added 32 points and 14 rebounds for the Oklahoma City Thunder in a chippy 129-121 overtime win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Damian Lillard turned in an epic performance, finishing with 51 points, nine assists and five rebounds. The end of regulation was filled with drama. Jusuf Nurkic took an elbow to the face from George, but George was not called for a foul. George missed his layup attempt on the play, but with Nurkic on the floor, Terrance Ferguson grabbed the rebound and scored with 13.1 seconds left to put Oklahoma City up 113-111. Moments later, George and Nurkic jawed at each other and drew technical fouls with 4.4 seconds left. Because it was Nurkic\u2019s second technical, he was ejected. Thunder coach Billy Donovan then chose reserve Skal Labissiere to shoot the Blazers\u2019 two free throws in place of Nurkic. He missed both, but a loose-ball foul was called on the Thunder and Al-Farouq-Aminu made both shots to tie it at 113 with 2.9 seconds left. After a turnover by the Thunder, the game went to overtime, where Westbrook scored eight points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer. The victory gave the Thunder a four-game series sweep of the Blazers this season, and pulled them ahead of Portland and Houston, who entered the night in a three-way tie for No. 3 in the West. Kanter antics  Enes Kanter reconnected with Westbrook before the game and received a nice cheer from fans at Moda Center as he checked in for his home debut in the first quarter. Kanter later introduced himself to woman sitting courtside while chasing down a loose ball. After leading by as many as 14 points, the Bucks found themselves in a tight battle with the Pacers midway through the third quarter. With the Bucks up 67-61, Giannis Antetokounmpo was hit hard on a dunk attempt. No whistle. Instead, Myles Turner was credited with a block and the Pacers went the other way, with Bojan Bogdanovic drilling a 3-pointer. Three-point game. Antetokounmpo stayed under the basket in disbelief for a moment before getting up and running down an official to voice his displeasure, immediately getting assessed a technical. Milwaukee responded with a 13-0 run. Antetokounmpo started the spurt with a dunk and finished it with another. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said the entire team fed off the technical foul. \u201cIt felt like the whole arena, his teammates, I think everybody was probably somewhat frustrated, but I think that frustration got channeled into a great energy,\u201d Budenholzer said. The Bucks never looked back on their way to a 117-98 victory , halting their first losing streak of the season. Antetokounmpo finished with a team-high 29 points and 12 rebounds. He scored eight straight points in the final minutes, including two spectacular dunks. Milwaukee\u2019s Got Talent  Can you name all 50 states in under 30 seconds?

The team reportedly made the decision after recently meeting with James\u2019 personal trainer. The Lakers, 30-35, are currently the 11th seed in the Western Conference and 6.5 games behind the 8th seed LA Clippers.

The Los Angeles Lakers superstar scored his 32,293rd point on a driving layup in the second quarter against the Denver Nuggets, getting fouled in the act and hitting the ensuing free throw. This achievement was particularly special to James, who grew up in Ohio idolizing Jordan. James tweeted his excitement about the milestone shortly before the game: \u201cCan\u2019t even front. This is going to be UNREAL!! Wow man.\u201d James began the night needing 13 points to reach the mark. He now trails only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points), Karl Malone (36,928) and Kobe Bryant (33,643). Under direction from the NBA, the Lakers waited until the next timeout to honor James, who got a standing ovation from his new Los Angeles fans during a tribute video. James, still engrossed in the game, barely acknowledged the milestone after receiving hugs from several teammates. James finished with 31 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, but powerful Denver beat the Lakers 115-99 . >  Fellow players react to LeBron\u2019s milestone From the very first day James picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together on Akron\u2019s competitive playgrounds and tough streets. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan\u2019s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire \u2013 even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts. James proudly put No. 23 on his back as soon as he could get it as a high school sophomore. He has never taken it off. \u201cHe was everything,\u201d James said. When James surpassed Jordan\u2019s career points total Wednesday night, he did it in a pair of Nikes with \u201cThank You M.J.\u201d written neatly on the side. That tribute doesn\u2019t begin to encompass what Jordan\u2019s radiance meant to a youngster who dreamed of finding a better life through basketball. \u201cM.J. was an inspiration,\u201d James said. \u201cM.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.\u201d James has grown into a 34-year-old man with three championship rings and a redoubtable 16-year NBA career. Yet he is still in awe of Jordan, who has represented the apex of achievement for his entire life. He bettered Jordan\u2019s scoring mark with another variation of the brute physical brilliance that defines his playing style \u2013 a style that was influenced by Jordan\u2019s combination of grace and aggressiveness. His struggling Lakers rallied late on Wednesday, but dropped their fourth straight game in a season that appears to be lost. Every loss eats at James, yet he fidgeted in front of his locker afterward with the anxiousness of a rookie, still buzzing over the enormity of the moment in his life. >  More scoring milestones from LeBron\u2019s career \u201cWhen you\u2019re an inner-city kid from Akron, Ohio, like myself and my guys growing up, you look for anything that can inspire you,\u201d James said. \u201cYou\u2019re always just up against the numbers of failing. The percentages of guys like myself \u2013 single-parent household, only child, underprivileged \u2013 (the chance of) making it out is not high at all. M.J. had a lot to do with me making it out, along with my mother, along with the city itself, along with the Little League coaches I had. But Mike had no idea what he was doing for a kid that was growing up a 45-minute flight away from Chicago, where he was putting in that work.\u201d James acknowledged he missed most of the tribute video aired at Staples Center during the timeout after his milestone points. That\u2019s because he was crying into a towel on the Lakers\u2019 bench. James is among the last active players who were old enough to witness Jordan in his prime with the Chicago Bulls. Little LeBron would buy packs of basketball cards hoping for a Jordan, and he would study every aspect of Jordan\u2019s game, down to the way he wore his calf sleeve turned slightly inside-out so that the red lining showed. James couldn\u2019t afford Air Jordans, but he remembers walking through the mall and marveling at the pristine red-and-black shoes. They inspired him to dream of having his own shoes, a natural result of being the star he hoped to become. \u201cYou guys have no idea what M.J. did for me and my friends growing up,\u201d James said. \u201cJust in a sense of, some days where you just don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to make it to the next day where I grew up, because of everything that\u2019s going on. Like I wrote on my shoes today, I thank M.J. more than he would ever know. I\u2019ve got to carry it on to the next kid. Hopefully I can inspire the next kid.\u201d James is an inspiration to a generation now, many of whom have already reached the NBA. Several of the Nuggets spoke of idolizing James while they grew up, and his own Lakers locker room includes teammates playing alongside one of their boyhood heroes. \u201cI never saw Michael live,\u201d said Moritz Wagner, the Lakers\u2019 21-year-old German rookie center. \u201c(James) is the G.O.A.T. of our generation.\u201d James trails only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points), Karl Malone (36,928) and Kobe Bryant (33,643) on the scoring chart. He seems likely to become the top scorer in NBA history if major injuries don\u2019t cloud his next three seasons with the Lakers \u2013 but those moments just might not resonate as profoundly for James. \u201cTo see where he is now is remarkable,\u201d said Denver coach Michael Malone, an assistant coach with the Cavs from 2005-10. \u201cHe makes everybody around him better. \u2026 He made us look like really good coaches in Cleveland. I know that LeBron James is arguably one of the greatest ever to lace them up, and this is a great accomplishment in his career.\u201d Five of the top six scorers in NBA history played for the Lakers, who signed James as a free agent last summer. Although James has only played 47 games for Los Angeles, he has charged up the career scoring chart in that time: He passed Dirk Nowitzki for sixth place in October, and he passed Wilt Chamberlain for fifth in November. He would have hit this milestone earlier in the winter, but a midseason groin injury on Christmas sidelined him for 17 games over five weeks \u2014 the longest injury absence of his career. This achievement also might be the biggest highlight of a disappointing season with the Lakers (30-35), who have fallen to the fringe of playoff contention. The struggles bother James, who has played in the last eight NBA Finals and hasn\u2019t missed the postseason since 2005. But James still seems relatively content with his move to Hollywood, where he is closer to his burgeoning career as an entertainment mogul. He has spoken repeatedly of patience with the young Lakers while the club attempts to land a second superstar to turn James\u2019 next team into a title contender. Even if this season is a failure, James will never forget the night when he made a historic connection with his childhood hero. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d James said. \u201cMy high school best friends, they text me and they can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe it either. We remember walking up and down those Akron streets with a basketball, just singing, `I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike.\u2019 \u201d"},{"id":35107,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-lebron-michael-jordan-detroit-pistons","date":"2019-03-07","title":"Hang Time Podcast: LeBron passes Michael Jordan + latest from Detroit","content":"John Schuhmann and I discuss last night\u2019s action around the NBA, which was highlighted by LeBron James rising to No. 4 on the all-time scoring list.

He has logged 10 games with 10 or more rebounds, the most 10-plus rebound games he\u2019s had since 2016-17 with the Denver Nuggets .

McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic. And once again, the Blazers are in the mix for a top-four seed in the Western Conference. After a 5-2 road trip coming out of the All-Star break, the Blazers are in a three-way tie with the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder for third place in the West. The Blazers don\u2019t have the easiest remaining schedule of those three teams (Houston does), but they don\u2019t have the toughest either (Oklahoma City does by far). And they\u2019ll have their most important game left on their schedule in their building on Thursday, when they host the Thunder. Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Blazers as they return home, play for third place in the West, and try to avoid a season sweep at the hands of the Thunder \u2026 The Blazers\u2019 starting lineup \u2014 Damian Lillard, C.J. McCollum, Maurice Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu and Jusuf Nurkic \u2014 has played 668 minutes together. That\u2019s the most minutes for any five-man unit this season . Lineup continuity begins with health. Four of the Blazers\u2019 five starters \u2014 Lillard (1), McCollum (1), Aminu (0) and Nurkic (1) \u2014 have missed no more than one of the Blazers\u2019 64 games this season. Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic have all exhibited pretty remarkable durability in Portland. Harkless has missed 20 games, but the other aspect of lineup continuity is substitution patterns. And Blazers coach Terry Stotts has kept his starters on the floor together more than he had in previous seasons. The Blazers\u2019 starting lineup has played 17.6 minutes per game, the third-highest average among the 499 lineups that have played in at least 10 games together. In McCollum\u2019s fourth season as a starter, he and Lillard have already played 1,865 minutes together, second-most among league-wide pairings and almost as many as they\u2019d played together in any of the previous three seasons. Prior to this season, Stotts staggered Lillard and McCollum\u2019s minutes to ensure at least one of them was always on the floor. Typically, McCollum would sit the last few minutes of the first and third quarters, while Lillard did likewise the first few minutes of the second and fourth.  Last season, Lillard and McCollum shared the floor for an average of 7:50 in the first quarter. That was up from a little less than seven minutes over the previous two seasons. This season, Lillard and McCollum don\u2019t go to the bench at the same time, but McCollum stays on the floor longer in the first quarter and both guards are on the bench to start the second. On average, the two of have played 8:58 together in the first quarter and 9:18 in the third. The minutes with both Lillard and McCollum on the floor have never been better. The Blazers have outscored their opponents by 6.3 points per 100 possessions with both in the game, the pair\u2019s best mark (by a pretty wide margin) in their four seasons starting together. And since the Blazers have been getting more of those minutes, the improvement is felt even more. The issue is that the minutes with neither Lillard nor McCollum on the floor \u2014 minutes that *didn\u2019t really exist the previous three seasons \u2014 have not been good. Evan Turner has been the Blazers\u2019 second-unit playmaker for most of the season, and in 457 minutes with Turner on the floor and both Lillard and McCollum on the bench, the Blazers have been outscored by 7.8 points per 100 possessions . (* Not counting garbage time.)  The Blazers have been 14 points per 100 possessions better offensively with Lillard on the floor (scoring 114.8) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (100.8). With both Lillard and McCollum on the bench, the minutes spanning the first and second quarters have been rough. The Blazers have been outscored by 33 points in the last three minutes of the first quarter (when only six teams have been worse) and by 61 points in the first three minutes of the second (when only two teams have been worse). But that averages out to losing just 1.5 points per game in those six minutes. More often than not, the Blazers have been able to make up for it with those extended Lillard-McCollum minutes. As noted above, the guards average more minutes together in the third quarter (when the Blazers are a plus-7 for the season over the final three minutes) than they do in the first. Also, the neither-on-the-floor option isn\u2019t as bad when you look at last year\u2019s numbers. Last season, the Blazers outscored their opponents by 4.9 points per 100 possessions with Lillard and McCollum on the floor together and by 4.9 per 100 in 774 minutes with Lillard on the floor without McCollum. But they were outscored by 6.5 points per 100 possessions in 1,027 minutes with McCollum on the floor without Lillard. The month of December did test Stotts\u2019 resolve. The Blazers were outscored by 19.4 points per 100 possessions (and scored an anemic 94.7 per 100) in 116 minutes that month with Turner on the floor without either Lillard or McCollum. On Dec. 11 in Houston, the Blazers lost by seven in a game in which they were a plus-13 in more than 35 minutes with Lillard and McCollum on the floor together. (So they were outscored by 20 points in less than 13 minutes with both on the bench.)  The following night in Memphis , Stotts went back to staggering his starting guards\u2019 minutes so that one of them was on the floor for the entire game. The Blazers still lost, Stotts went back to using a full, five-man bench unit two nights later, and it rewarded him with quality minutes in a win over Toronto on Dec. 14 . There were more ugly bench nights after that, but Stotts has stuck with the original plan of sitting Lillard and McCollum together. The Blazers\u2019 most-used five-man bench unit \u2014 Turner, Seth Curry, Nik Stauskas, Zach Collins and Meyers Leonard \u2014 outscored its opponents by 1.5 points per 100 possession in its 196 minutes together. A month ago, the Blazers upgraded the Stauskas spot by trading for Rodney Hood . At the All-Star break, they also added Enes Kanter off the buyout market. Because Turner missed most of the Blazers\u2019 post-break trip, he\u2019s played in just two games with Hood and Kanter . But in 52 minutes so far with Hood on the court without Lillard or McCollum, the Blazers have outscored their opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions , with much better offensive numbers (115.2 scored per 100) than in those Turner minutes. We\u2019ll see if Stotts sits his two guards together in the playoffs. They\u2019ll each surely play additional minutes (Lillard has averaged 40.5 minutes in his 35 career playoff games ), and those can be used to either have one on the floor at all times or to increase the minutes that they\u2019re both on the floor together. There\u2019s certainly a case for the latter plan.

Trae Young is making sure of that. Last week, I wrote that Young was pushing the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Luka Doncic thanks to back-to-back 36-point games. Looking back on things, I should\u2019ve given him the top rung last week. But then, Young had a performance for the ages, scoring 49 points with 16 assists and eight rebounds in last Friday\u2019s four-overtime loss to the Chicago Bulls . Young was 17-for-33 in the 168-161 thriller, hitting six 3-pointers while playing 56 minutes. His performance won over at least one opponent \u2014 Bulls veteran guard Zach LaVine. \u201cTrae Young is an incredible talent,\u201d said LaVine , who finished with a career-high 47 points himself. \u201cYou can already see. He has the \u2018it\u2019 factor.\u201d Young\u2019s outburst put him in some rarefied air, as well. He is only the third rookie to notch a 40-point, 10-assist game, joining Michael Jordan (he did it twice) and LeBron James. He also became just the fourth player (of any kind) to tally a 45-point, 15-assist game. The others? James Harden, Isiah Thomas and Gail Goodrich. Vince Carter, his 42-year-old teammate, has seen Young\u2019s progress, and likes how the Hawks\u2019 rookie has grown. \u201cEverything\u2019s starting to slow down for him and everything\u2019s starting to make sense for him,\u201d Carter said . \u201cThis is my opinion, but the best thing that happened to him was the struggle in the beginning (of the season) \u2026 Now, he\u2019s reaping the benefit of it. It\u2019s been a blessing in disguise. Maybe he doesn\u2019t see it, or his fans, but what it\u2019s done for him now has been unreal.\u201d Even though Young came back to earth (including getting ejected Sunday in Chicago) after his big night, I\u2019m not going to make the same mistake I made last week. For now, I\u2019m giving Young the top rung. Whether he can hold on to it will be a different story. * * * Last week:  No. 2 As mentioned above, Young came back to earth after his huge night against the Bulls. He had 18 points and was well on his way to another big showing in the second matchup with Chicago before being ejected for taunting in the third quarter. He followed that up with a 14-point night (missing all four 3-point attempts) with eight assists in a loss in Miami , then put up 22 points, six rebounds and four assists in a loss to the Spurs on Wednesday . He was just 1-for-7 from beyond the arc and 8-for-24 overall. If this is what we\u2019re going to see from the Hawks rookie down the stretch, Doncic will certainly grab back the top rung. 2. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  Last week:  No. 1 Doncic certainly hasn\u2019t done much wrong to earn this demotion. Call it rewarding Young for his recent hot streak. Over three games this week, Doncic averaged 23 points, seven rebounds and 3.3 assists per game while also getting 2.3 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Those solid numbers were certainly helped by Wednesday\u2019s line of 31-11-7 with four steals in a 132-123 loss to the Wizards . On the season, Doncic still holds the edge over Young due to his consistency and sheer volume of big games, but he\u2019ll need to keep pushing if he wants to gain back his top rung. Wednesday\u2019s showing against the Wizards was a good start. 3. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns  Last week:  No. 5 The Suns are on a three-game winning streak \u2014 yes, you read that right \u2014 and Ayton has been key to all three wins. In the first of the three, the No. 1 overall pick owned the Lakers inside , putting up 26 points, 10 rebounds with a pair of steals and a block. He followed that with another double-double, putting up 19 points and 12 rebounds in a huge upset over the league leading Bucks. Ayton\u2019s defense on Giannis Antetokounmpo, though, is what had everyone raving. Ayton blocked three shots and generally caused problems for \u201cThe Greek Freak,\u201d leading ESPN\u2019s Paul Pierce to compare the rookie to Hall of Famer David Robinson on Tuesday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Jump\u201d. Last week:  Not ranked Shamet seems to be finding his role with the Clippers, becoming the reliable 3-point shooter he\u2019d been early in the season before being traded from the Sixers in the Tobias Harris deal. Shamet has scored in double digits in his last three games (all wins), averaging 17.7 ppg while shooting 50 percent overall and 53.6 percent from beyond the arc (15-for-28). If the Clippers are going to make a run at the playoffs, Shamet could play a big role. Last week:  No. 4 Robinson\u2019s numbers regressed slightly in four games this week, but he\u2019s still proving to be a beast in the paint, especially on the defensive end. In four games, Robinson averaged 10 ppg, 8.8 rpg and 3 bpg in just 23 minutes per game. DeAndre Jordan returned to the Knicks\u2019 lineup Wednesday night after missing five games, so Robinson could see his playing time dip even further down the stretch. Or, if the Knicks are wise, they\u2019ll let the young big man run free in the paint and do his thing to see just what they\u2019ve got. Just missed the cut  Allonzo Trier, New York Knicks Trier had a very impressive week as the Knicks struggle to find wins (they lost all four games this week). He averaged 19.8 points and 4.3 rebounds in almost 30 minutes per game, highlighted by a 29-point outburst in a 115-108 loss in Sacramento . Since the All-Star break, Trier has been one of the best rookie scorers , averaging 18 ppg on 52.1 percent shooting and 52.4 percent on 3-pointers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers Gilgeous-Alexander had a great week as the Clippers put up a three-game winning streak with wins over the Kings, Knicks and Lakers. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 14.7 ppg on 54.8 percent shooting (6-for-8 on 3-pointers) and, even more importantly, only committed two turnovers total in those three games. Harry Giles III, Sacramento Kings Giles has become a crucial part to the Kings\u2019 rotation, especially since fellow rookie Marvin Bagley III (two IIIs on the same team has to be a record) was sidelined by a sprained knee . Over his last four games, Giles has averaged 14 ppg and 5.4 rpg in 19.4 mpg. He won over Sacramento fans after being ejected in the Kings\u2019 win over the Knicks on Monday. Buddy Hield says Giles is \u201cobviously our best passer\u201d and De\u2019Aaron Fox is loving Giles\u2019 boost off the bench. \u201cHe goes out there and plays with energy all the time,\u201d Fox said. \u201cSometimes he plays with too much energy, but it\u2019s something every team needs.\u201d Rodion Kurucs, Brooklyn Nets Kurucs saw an increase in playing time this week, and made the most of it with three straight double-digit games. In those games, he averaged 13.3 ppg, 6.7 rpg and 1.7 bpg as the Nets went 2-1 with wins against the Mavs and Cavs . Against Dallas, Kurucs was 5-for-7 from beyond the arc and finished with 19 points to spark the win. * * * (All stats through Wednesday, March 6) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham.

His career scoring as a fifth-year player is not nearing the top of any list \u2014 except for Wednesday night\u2019s top performers. But Zach LaVine did his best to grab the spotlight, scoring 39 points, capped by the game-winning layup with 1.6 seconds left, to lift the Chicago Bulls over the playoff-bound Philadephia 76ers 108-107 . Here is the winning drive and layup, which came from a Robin Lopez assist: LaVine\u2019s drive one-upped Jimmy Butler \u2014 for whom LaVine was traded back in 2015, and whose two free throws with 4.8 seconds remaining had given the 76ers a one-point lead in a hotly contested game that saw 20 ties and 19 lead changes. \u201cI saw the lane and I took it, \u201d said LaVine in his walk-off interview. He was fouled on the winning layup and purposely missed the free throw to consume time. On the 76ers\u2019 subsequent in-bounds play with only 0.5 seconds left, LaVine broke up the pass from Ben Simmons. But the game wasn\u2019t over. The clock had started early because Lopez appeared to tip the in-bounds pass, and the horn sounded before anyone caught the ball. But a review determined Lopez had not touched it and the final 0.5 seconds were replayed. The second inbounds pass wasn\u2019t handled by Butler, who finished with 22 points. Butler apparently wasn\u2019t too happy with his coach\u2019s final-second play calling. The young bulls are on an upswing since just before the All-Star break, having won six of their last 10. LaVine, who will be 24 years old on March 10, scored 26 of his 39 points in the second half (13 in both the third and fourth quarters) to lead the Bulls\u2019 rally from eight down with 5:49 left. This season, he\u2019s averaging a career-best 23.5 points, 4.6 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. The loss had to be a bitter pill to swallow for the 76ers, fighting to keep home-court advantage for the playoffs with 17 games remaining. Joel Embiid missed his seventh straight game with a sore left knee as the 76ers hope to have him healthy for postseason. Generational player LeBron James moved into fourth in career scoring, surpassing the player many call the greatest of all-time, Michael Jordan. The milestone came on a driving layup in the second quarter, which gave LeBron 32,293 points for his career. He was fouled on the play and hit the free throw. LeBron, in a career filled with scoring highlights and championships, was aware this milestone was near and tweeted about it before the game, which the Nuggets won 115-99 . Kick around this graphical look at James\u2019 points milestones through the years. The Lakers\u2019 loss, their fourth straight, puts them at 30-35 for the season and 6.5 games behind the Clippers and Spurs for the No. 8 seed in the West with 17 left to play. Now that L.A.\u2019s\u2019 playoff hopes are essentially done, LeBron might be unlikely to play big minutes for the rest of the season. Big men are coveted in the NBA for their rim-protecting ability. A 7-footer can keep the mere mortal 6-foot-4, 6-foot-5 player from driving and slamming a dunk home. Well, in theory. Here are two instances Wednesday night in which the smaller player gets the best of the big man guarding the basket: The Wizards\u2019 Bradley Beal (6-foot-5) posterizes the Mavericks\u2019 7-foot-2 Salah Mejri and stares him down. The Spurs\u2019 Derrick White (6-foot-4) crushes it over the Hawks\u2019 7-foot-1 Alex Len and gets fouled hard. After struggling of late, the Boston Celtics might be gaining a little momentum. Gordon Hayward hit a game-winner with two seconds left to lift the Celtics over the Sacramento Kings 111-109 , and they did it without Kyrie Irving, who sat out with a sore left thigh. It was the second win in a row for Boston, which is fighting for home-court advantage that the No. 4 seed would confer. They trail the fourth-place 76ers by 1.5 games. \u201cIt\u2019s another one we can build on,\u201d said Hayward, who finished with 12 points. Monday night, the Celtics pounded the two-time reigning champion Warriors 128-95 .  The Washington Wizards showed some love for Dirk Nowitzki as the Wizards hosted the Dallas Mavericks , with a lengthy introduction highlighting his achievements in what is probably his final season.  The Wizards captured the moment in this tweet: As for the game, it quickly turned into a duel between the Wizards\u2019 Bradley Beal and the Mavericks rookie guard\/forward Luka Doncic, who turned 20 on Feb. 28. Beal, who had a poster dunk in the first quarter , led the Wizards to a 132-123 victory in an intraconference matchup of two teams unlikely to make the playoffs. Beal finished with 30 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. Doncic had a stellar night with 31 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists. He also stood atop the top performers list in steals with four. Surrounded by reporters after the game, Beal took a little dig at the rookie. Fans often do a little extra to show their allegiance to a team or player. A favorite numbered jersey, a team sweat-shirt or wearing a players\u2019 line of kicks is usually the extent of it. A guy in Chicago went the extra mile for the ESPN matchup of 76ers vs. Chicago . Painted upon the shaved back of his head was an image of what looks like Zach LaVine and an image of Joel Embiid (who didn\u2019t play Tuesday night) separated by \u201cESPN.\u201d "},{"id":35106,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/players-around-nba-react-lebron-passing-jordan","date":"2019-03-07","title":"Players react to LeBron passing Jordan","content":"Moments after LeBron James moved past Michael Jordan into fourth place on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list, Magic Johnson and players around the league began tweeting tributes to The King \u2026"},{"id":35141,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-alibaba-expand-china-partnership-official-release","date":"2019-03-07","title":"NBA and Alibaba Expand China Partnership","content":" BEIJING \u2014 NBA China and Alibaba Group today announced an expansion of their partnership that will bring NBA content to Alibaba\u2019s platforms for the first time, along with an enhanced online shopping experience for consumers in China.

(AP) \u2014 The Golden State Warriors signed Andrew Bogut, who is expected to rejoin the team next week and add depth heading into the playoffs. The Warriors made the announcement Wednesday, after Bogut was cleared by his Australian team, the Sydney Kings. The Warriors are without Damian Jones, who needed surgery after injuring his left pectoral muscle in December. \u201cHe\u2019s still got something to offer,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cWhatever role that means, he\u2019s ready to accept and take on the challenge and we\u2019re excited to have him.\u201d Golden State has struggled defensively, losing in embarrassing fashion at home to Boston 128-95 on Tuesday night, so Bogut\u2019s 7-foot presence in the paint could be timely.

So that takes out Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox and Atlanta\u2019s John Collins. And leaves me with Fox\u2019s teammate on the Kings, Buddy Hield, at No. 3 . Brooklyn\u2019s D\u2019Angelo Russell is my No. 2 , with an All-Star nod as consolation. But my top choice is Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam , who has doubled-down as an impact player for the Raptors. Sometimes a guy\u2019s improvement comes from greater opportunity, but Siakam has flipped that \u2014 his handling of the added responsibilities heaped on him has earned the extra minutes and touches. Also, there are bonus points for doing this all as a No. 27 pick vs. No. 2 (Russell) or No. 6 (Hield). Shaun Powell :  Pascal Siakam , Raptors; D\u2019Angelo Russell , Nets and Paul George , Thunder. Siakim on some nights is Toronto\u2019s best player and suddenly he\u2019s insurance in case Kawhi Leonard leaves this summer. Russell is an All-Star two years after his career and reputation as a leader was in serious question with the Lakers. George is a Kia MVP candidate and somehow has gone \u201cnext level\u201d so late in his career. John Schuhmann : In alphabetical order, because these guys have taken different steps in their careers and I don\u2019t need to figure out who goes where on my ballot until April 10 \u2026 Sekou Smith :  Much like the Kia MVP and Coach of the Year races, the top spots for Kia Most Improved are hard to come by this season. There are quite a few quality candidates. That said, I\u2019ll go with Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam at No. 1 , Brooklyn\u2019s D\u2019Angelo Russell at No. 2 and Miami\u2019s Josh Richardson at No. 3 ( with Sacramento\u2019s D\u2019Aaron Fox right there ). You can make a rock-solid case for anyone of the three guys mentioned. Siakam has blossomed into a fantastic two-way player for a contender. Russell has shed the drama from his early days in the league and became an All-Star. And the criminally underrated Richardson has assumed a leadership role in Miami that no one saw coming. There are at least three or four others guys who could easily be added to this list, but you asked for three so I\u2019ll stay inside the lines here."},{"id":46532,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-how-will-andrew-bogut-help-warriors","date":"2019-03-06","title":"Blogtable: How might Bogut help Warriors?","content":" * * * What would the addition of Andrew Bogut mean for the Warriors?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Bogut is a solid defender and great screen-setter, always welcome in Golden State\u2019s brand of offense. He also is a cerebral player and deft passer they\u2019ll welcome back into the attack. And frankly, given the hiccups the Warriors have had lately, he\u2019ll be a nice touchstone mentally, and friendly face in the locker room, to their first championship team in 2015 and the 73-9 romp that followed. Remember, he suffered a knee injury in Game 5 of the 2016 Finals ; the Warriors were 15-7 in the playoffs games in which he played that spring, a haunting 0-2 once he went out. Shaun Powell :  The addition would bring \u2026 virtually nothing. No offense to the big fella, but most of the minutes are taken in the rotation, unless DeMarcus Cousins suffers an injury. Also, we\u2019re not sure how much Bogut has left on the NBA level \u2014 being a force in Australia isn\u2019t the same. All told, he\u2019s good to have around and if nothing else will serve as a voice, with an accent, in the locker room. John Schuhmann :  He\u2019s another option at center, and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if he gets meaningful minutes in the postseason. He should be more mobile than DeMarcus Cousins, who\u2019s had obvious issues defending in space and will be targeted by the offense of every Warriors opponent in the playoffs. Cousins is, by far, the better offensive player. But when you have Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on the floor, the better defender will often be the better fit. Since Cousins\u2019 first game, the Warriors have been outscored by 0.9 points per 100 possessions in 152 minutes with all five stars on the floor, but are a plus-16.0 per 100 in 105 minutes with the other four guys on the floor without Cousins. Down the stretch of close games, the fifth guy on the floor will most likely be Andre Iguodala (with Draymond Green at center) instead of either Cousins or Bogut.  Sekou Smith :  Andrew Bogut rejoining the Warriors hints at a throwback move for the Warriors in some respects, given his history with the championship Warriors pre-Kevin Durant. It also makes me wonder what it says about their big man depth \u2014  and perhaps more importantly, what they think they\u2019ll get out of Cousins this season \u2014 and whether or not there are internal concerns. They\u2019ve won titles without relying heavily on their bigs, though Bogut, Festus Ezeli, JaVale McGee and Zaza Pachulia have all played important roles at that spot in recent seasons. If Bogut looks as good as some have suggested after his MVP and Defensive Player of the Year season in the Australian Basketball League, the Warriors could be adding the ideal insurance policy for their three-peat campaign. But I\u2019ll wait until I see Bogut back in that Warriors uniform before making any lasting judgements. * * *"},{"id":35188,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-celtics-lakers-record-so-far","date":"2019-03-06","title":"Blogtable: More surprised by Celtics' or Lakers\u2019 record so far?","content":"* * * What\u2019s more surprising at this point of the season: The Lakers at 30-34, or the Celtics at 39-26?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  The Celtics. We suspected the Lakers might be a hot mess, what with LeBron James\u2019 dominant personality landing in a brand new culture and the dubious roster heavy with veteran, one-year place holders. Mix in the trauma\/drama of the Anthony Davis trade speculation and this is not such a surprising result. But the Celtics were supposed to be onward and upward from last spring\u2019s playoff push, essentially adding both Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving to that freshly seasoned crew. Instead, we\u2019ve seen a failure to launch in the more navigable East. Maybe there has been an \u201cother shoe,\u201d Davis-trade effect on this squad, too, with young Boston players wondering about their fates this summer.And so far, this has spoken volumes about Irving\u2019s ability to lead and overall impact on chemistry. Shaun Powell :  The Lakers. Even with the injuries and playing in the Western Conference, posting a losing record and being on the verge of missing the playoffs seems unusual, especially some of the games they\u2019ve lost (Hawks, Cavs, Suns, etc.). But it\u2019s a close call. Both are bewildering. John Schuhmann :  The Celtics. At the start of the season, with the strength of the Western Conference and the lack of shooting around LeBron James, it wasn\u2019t clear that the Lakers were a playoff team. So my preseason self wouldn\u2019t be too surprised to see them in 11th place. The Celtics actually have a much better point differential than they did last season and, as we saw in Oakland on Tuesday , can play like the best team in the league on any given night. But they\u2019ve run hot and cold, and too often, the whole has been less than the sum of the parts. The four teams ahead of them in the East standings are all very good, but given their talent, the Celtics should not be at the bottom of that group and, potentially, starting the playoffs on the road. Sekou Smith :  I can honestly say that both the Lakers and Celtics have surprised me this season , and not in a good way . The Celtics, however, entered this season with far greater expectations than the Lakers. I figured the Lakers for a playoff team with LeBron James as their anchor. They\u2019d need for things to go well on the injury front (they have not) and they\u2019d need their youngsters to make a huge leap from last season (they have not). The Lakers\u2019 season is officially a tire fire now. But the Celtics are dealing with chemistry issues that I never saw coming. Their current predicament is stunning when you consider the quality and depth on their roster, not to mention the chops of their head coach. I was never on the Brad Stevens genius bandwagon, but he did a fine job making things work when Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward were not available for the postseason last year. You find out some critically important things about people when they are dealing with adversity, with external pressures and with added expectations. The shocking part for me watching the Celtics is how poorly they are dealing with all of the above. The Celtics are nowhere near the best team in the East, as they were cast in the offseason."},{"id":35221,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-jordan-lebron-james-settling-goat-debate","date":"2019-03-06","title":"Jordan vs. LeBron, LeBron vs. Jordan ... either way, it's a taste test","content":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Not since the biggest culinary quandary of our time and maybe all time \u2014 ketchup or mustard on a hot dog? \u2014 has a debate stirred emotions, drawn lines, fractured families and friends and caused even the sanest of souls to lose control: Who\u2019s the greatest player ever, Michael Jordan or LeBron James? It is never really settled. After making a fuss, the topic just sits there alone, like cold soup, ready to be reheated whenever people need a reason to get riled up. Everyone brings their own prejudices and preferences into the mix, trying to make a compelling case, frantically tossing in and out more numbers than a deadline-stressed accountant on April 14, pumping up their guy in order to put down the other guy . God created sports bars and water coolers and Skip Bayless for this very reason, to bring the mother of all basketball arguments to the forefront and mash it and mash it and mash it again into a paste without really coming up with a definitive conclusion. Each side digs in and no one is suddenly convinced and crosses over to the other side. Instead, MJ vs. LeBron seems certain to keep us divided as a nation. The tug-of-war rope is destined to gain tension once again, now that LeBron has passed Jordan for fourth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list . Doing so took a bit of an ax to the Jordan throne, once believed to be untouchable and impenetrable. But fret no more. It is my job, as your humble referee, to introduce sanity and reason to explain, once and for all, the merits of this touchy G.O.A.T. debate and provide clarity and an answer that will, of course, satisfy no one. (Note: There\u2019s no reason to weigh the spin-off benefits of each player. Jordan boasts unprecedented clout as a product pitchman and LeBron has the reach via social justice and good deeds done through youth programs back home in Akron. None of that has a voice in pure basketball matters when it comes to the G.O.A.T. discussion, even though each player has made a mark beyond basketball.) Because the current climate demands it once again, we begin. As a society, we tend to be swayed by the moment, by the living and the breathing. Whatever is happening live and immediately leads us to dismiss anything or anyone that happened before ESPN. And among other things, this is why LeBron has momentum. He is right now. He is today. He is right in front of us. * Milestone baskets from LeBron\u2019s career Most of his career has taken place in the social media age, which makes the larger-than-life even larger than life and brings the power of persuasion to the masses worldwide. When LeBron sneezes, for example, laptop screens in China need to be wiped clean. But don\u2019t get it twisted; LeBron\u2019s obvious gifts and legacy are very real, no matter the medium. Let\u2019s list the honors, in order of weight: Twelve-time All-NBA first team, three Finals MVPs, three NBA titles (one in Cleveland, which should count double), four Kia MVPs, nine Finals trips in 15 seasons (including eight straight), 15 All-Star Games and five All-Defensive first team honors. He\u2019s the most unselfish scorer in league history, the only player to rank among the top 10 all-time in points and assists . Not since his rookie season has LeBron failed to lead his team in at least three major statistical categories. He has been, at times, the best point guard on the floor, the best shooting guard, the best power forward, the best small forward. His ability to lift mediocre teams consistently could be unmatched by anyone. The Cavs were poorly run through much of his time in Cleveland and that actually worked in his favor from an optics standpoint. His 2007 Finals team was arguably the weakest finalist ever, as the Cavs\u2019 Finals starters were a combination of Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, Sasha Pavlovic, Daniel Gibson and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. He\u2019s had signature moments, such as his Game 5 outburst against the Detroit Pistons in the 2007 Eastern Conference finals, deflating the Boston Celtics with 45 points and 15 rebounds down 3-2 in the 2012 East finals. And the chase-down swat of Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals, among others. That\u2019s all good \u2026 but here are the nit-picks. LeBron has two stains on his legacy that can\u2019t be bleached: When he checked out against the Celtics in the 2010 East semifinals , and the 2011 NBA Finals when he never checked in against the Dallas Mavericks . Those are not up for debate. They are vitamins to the argument that LeBron wasn\u2019t wired like Jordan when it came to winning and producing in moments of truth. His Finals series record is 3-6, although to be fair, his teams weren\u2019t favored in four of those losses (in \u201907 vs. the Spurs and the last three Finals vs. the Warriors ). Also, in a far lesser vein, one of LeBron\u2019s three titles was secured when he missed a desperate 3-pointer in the clutch with his team facing elimination. The ball took a fortunate bounce off the rim and into the palms of Miami teammate Chris Bosh , who instinctively threw to Ray Allen and the rest is history . Another title was clinched when Kyrie Irving, not LeBron, dropped the trophy-winning shot in Game 7 of the 2015 Finals. Those are the details in the fine print that says LeBron\u2019s career is a fraction shy of perfection, and feel free to ignore that or concede as much. Which leads to this \u2026 The vast majority of sports fans born years too late to witness Babe Ruth were rewarded with Babe in baggy shorts from the mid-1980s to early 2000s. Jordan was the first NBA player to rise higher than the game , to tap into those parts of society that didn\u2019t follow sports or athletes, to become a cultural icon . Not to the extent of Muhammad Ali. But beyond anyone else of Jordan\u2019s generation, by far. He did so by winning championships and dropping memorable performances regardless of when and where he played. Folks in Sacramento, for example, were just as likely to see Jordan\u2019s brilliance in February as those in New York in May. Jordan didn\u2019t take nights off, didn\u2019t coast, didn\u2019t save himself. He got up for everyone. * Legends profile: Michael Jordan And Jordan spent 18 months of his prime \u2014 he was 30 at the time \u2014 dealing with a mid-life crisis that caused him to leave basketball for minor-league baseball . Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston Rockets, who repeated as champs in Jordan\u2019s absence (\u201894 and \u201995), are forever grateful. Let\u2019s list the honors, in order of weight: Six NBA titles (while going six-for-six in The Finals), six Finals MVPs, five regular-season MVPs, 10 All-NBA first teams, 10 scoring titles, 14 All-Star Games, nine All-Defensive first team honors and one Defensive Player of the Year Award. In the post-Celtics dynasty era of the 1960s, he\u2019s the most efficient modern-day winner. He constantly raised his game to meet the stakes and never failed on the biggest of NBA stages. Jordan was the result of flair meeting talent and bloodthirsty spirit. The signature moments: His God-disguised-as-Michael-Jordan 63-point barrage on the Celtics in the first round of 1986. The \u201cShrug Game\u201d in the 1992 Finals. The \u201cFlu Game\u201d in the 1997 Finals. The legacy-calling, Bryon Russell-falling shot against Utah in The 1998 Finals (which was preceded by the most underrated play in championship history: stealing the ball off Karl Malone). Setting up Steve Kerr for the Finals clincher in 1997 . The reverse-flip against the Lakers in the 1991 Finals (Marv Albert voice: \u201c Oh, a spec-tac-ular move, by Michael Jordan!\u201d ). And, of course, the jumper over the fingertips of Craig Ehlo and the Cavs in 1989, among others. It\u2019s nearly impossible to chip away at Jordan\u2019s basketball imprint, especially once he got help on the Bulls and vanquished his boogeyman: the Isiah Thomas-led \u201cBad Boy\u201d Detroit Pistons . It\u2019s perhaps cruel to punish him for his two Washington Wizards seasons (2001-03), when Jordan was aging (and yet also an All-Star) and soon caved to nagging injuries caused by all those Bulls playoff runs. Still, Nick Anderson did pick him clean in a crucial playoff moment in 1995 when No. 45 made a hasty, midseason return to the NBA . Jordan \u2014 like other greats during his time \u2014 took advantage of an NBA watered down and weakened by the addition of expansion teams in the late \u201880s. And while on the subject of questionable competition, did he beat anyone special in the NBA Finals? The legacy of Jordan will be held to a higher elevation by the stubborn generation that saw him play, a generation that will not allow anything LeBron does (or anyone who comes after LeBron) to rob them of their moment. Likewise, if you ask a segment of the current generation about Jordan, some may ask innocently: \u201cYou mean the guy on the shoes?\u201d Which leads to \u2026 There are two: LeBron isn\u2019t done yet. And Jordan played in a different era. Shouldn\u2019t LeBron serve his entire career before anyone classifies him and what he\u2019s done in the NBA? Granted, he is on the back-nine and, at 34, struggling to put the Lakers in the playoffs. He also dealt with a semi-major injury for the first time ever, missing more than a month this season . But there\u2019s still another 2-3 years at a high level should he stay healthy, and if the Lakers add the right pieces around him this summer, maybe another Finals run, too. As for Jordan, keep in mind he played his career when the game was more physical and restrictive to offensive players. Defenders could hand-check Jordan without penalty. Had Jordan played in today\u2019s NBA with no hand-checking and freedom of movement, is it unrealistic to say he could\u2019ve averaged 40 points for a several-season stretch? In addition, the 3-pointer wasn\u2019t as widespread as now. Surely, Jordan \u2013 who averaged 1.7 3-pointers per game \u2014 would\u2019ve incorporated the shot more into his weaponry. Doesn\u2019t that make the LeBron-Jordan comparison more apples-to-oranges than you might think? Different players, different eras and a handful of conditional factors make this murkier than anyone wants to believe. Besides, the most accomplished crib-to-retirement basketball player was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who never got cut from his high school team (Jordan) or lost a state championship game (LeBron), won three NCAA titles in three years (freshmen were ineligible for the varsity, keeping him from going four-for-four), six NBA titles and sits atop the career scoring heap . So if we simply must have this debate, then upon further inspection, weighing all the important factors, judging the facts evenly, wiping away any biases and understanding the difficulty of it all, there can only be one answer, and it is \u2026 ketchup. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

OK, it was only one game, but a resounding win over the defending champion Warriors is something that can turn a team around. Gordon Hayward scored 30 points on 12-for-16 shooting as the Celtics never trailed on their way to a convincing 128-95 win over the Warriors at Oracle Arena. \u201cWe put a lot of emphasis on being connected, being together,\u201d Kyrie Irving told TNT\u2019s Caron Butler afterward. \u201cWhen we\u2019re all clicking like that, we\u2019re hard to beat.\u201d Irving had 19 points and 11 assists to help Boston bounce back from Sunday\u2019s 115-104 home loss to the Rockets and put to rest \u2013 at least for one night \u2013 talk of the Celtics\u2019 recent struggles. \u2028\u2028With his team looking to come together for the stretch run, a win in Oakland could do wonders for their title hopes, which had looked bleak after the Celtics closed February on a four-game losing streak. It was the third 30-point game of the season for Hayward, who has struggled all season to find his groove since suffering a gruesome leg injury in the first game of the 2017-18 season. For the Warriors, the 33-point loss was the biggest of the season and worst blowout at home during coach Steve Kerr\u2019s five-year tenure. Rockets solve Toronto dilemma  The Rockets aren\u2019t used to winning in Toronto. Houston had lost nine of its last 11 visits north of the border and were facing a stiff challenge against the East elites, who were 27-6 at home entering Tuesday\u2019s matchup. Midway through the second quarter, all appeared to be going to plan, with Houston building a 22-point lead. But nothing comes easy in Toronto, and the Raptors rallied to regain the lead midway through the third quarter. Then James Harden woke up. Harden scored 19 of his 35 points \u2013 including the team\u2019s final 16 points \u2013 in the fourth quarter to lead the Rockets to a 107-95 victory and extend their winning streak to six straight. Harden led the Rockets in scoring for the 42nd straight game, the fifth-longest streak in NBA history. He also kept another streak alive, topping 28 points for his 39th straight game. That streak is the second-longest in NBA history, with Wilt Chamberlain (71 games) holding the record. Harden wasn\u2019t the only star taking over in the fourth quarter Tuesday. In Memphis, Mike Conley scored a career-high 40 points, including 19 in the final period to rally the Grizzlies to a 120-111 win over the Trail Blazers . After going scoreless in the first quarter and tweaking an ankle, Conley returned and went 6-for-7 from the field in the fourth quarter, igniting the crowd with a performance for the ages. This four-point play, which came with 1:38 left, put a ribbon on the Grizzlies\u2019 upset victory. \u201cThe crowd was really into it, the energy in the building was there,\u201d Conley said. \u201cIt was just a fun environment. My teammates had fun, I had fun.\u201d Memphis is still 26-40 and ahead of only Phoenix in the Western Conference standings, but for one night at least, Conley and the Grizzlies gave the Memphis faithful something to cheer about. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for him, a guy we battle for,\u201d coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \u201cWe understand how classy he is, the type of person he is. Any success that he has, you enjoy it for him. He deserves it all. All the good things that happen to him, he deserves it because of the way he carries himself every day, the way he works every single day. There\u2019s so much respect and appreciation for him as a human being and as a basketball player.\u201d \u2028 Marcus Smart had one of the best dimes of the night, finding a cutting Gordon Hayward with the behind-the-back wraparound feed. Towns to the rescue  The Wolves entered Tuesday night on a three-game losing streak and seeing their playoff hopes dwindling. It didn\u2019t help they were facing the Thunder, who welcomed the return of Paul George, who had missed three games with a right shoulder injury. But Karl-Anthony Towns put his team on his shoulders, scoring 41 points and grabbing 14 rebounds in a 131-120 win over Oklahoma City . This dunk in the third quarter put the Thunder on notice: But this dunk capped off his second 40-point game of the year and put an exclamation point on the Wolves\u2019 win: Karl-Anthony Towns has scored 182 points over his last five games, the best five-game stretch in team history. Towns also moved into fifth place on Minnesota\u2019s career scoring list, passing Wally Szczerbiak (6,777 points). There\u2019s something mesmerizing about a great Phantom Cam clip, and no better example than two superstars going face to face: Try, try again \u2026 OK, third time\u2019s the charm: Zach LaVine might have got the last laugh there, but Myles Turner got the win, leading the Pacers to a 105-96 win with a career-high seven blocks to go along with 10 points and 11 rebounds.

She stood, smiled and put on a Warriors cap, striding to the stage backed by the loudest applause of the night. Someone put a microphone in front of her and asked her how it felt. That\u2019s when she finally choked up. \u201dIt changes everything,\u201d she said. \u201dIt means everything to me.\u201d Evans became the first woman ever drafted into the NBA 2K League on Tuesday night, going in the fourth round to Warriors Gaming, which is operated by the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors. A former college and semipro basketball player, Evans is now the esports league\u2019s first female pro, one of the 126 players who will make between $33,000 to $37,000 per season, plus benefits and team housing. No more sessions as a trainer at Planet Fitness. The Chicago native is heading to the Bay Area. \u201dIt feels surreal,\u201d she said. Evans was one of two women who qualified for the 2K League draft this year through the league\u2019s online combine. The other, Brianna Novin, was not selected but could still sign as a free agent. The NBA runs the league in coordination with 2K game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and it did not have any women for its inaugural season. Prior to last year\u2019s draft, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called the lack of gender diversity \u201da disappointment for all of us so far.\u201d The league set out to solve that problem by holding focus groups with top women gamers to spot potential barriers. One key problem: Data showed that male players weren\u2019t passing the ball to their female teammates \u2013 something that wasn\u2019t accounted for when the league analyzed players to build the 2018 draft pool. \u201dIt made us put more emphasis on how good a player was when they got the ball in their hands,\u201d said 2K League managing director Brendan Donohue. \u201dThat\u2019s the only part of it they can control.\u201d The league also monitored communication between players more carefully at this year\u2019s combine, removing several players for sexist remarks. That kind of harassment isn\u2019t new to Evans, or women in esports in general. One of the biggest challenges for women is finding teammates for games that rely so heavily on teamwork. Female gamers can try to ignore an offensive, trash-talking opponent \u2013 and there are plenty of those in the 2K community. But just like in real life, you can\u2019t defend a pick-and-roll if your teammates aren\u2019t willing to communicate. Evans has done most of her competitive gaming with a coed team \u2013 right now, five of its 12 players are women \u2013 and that\u2019s helped her thrive as a shot-creating small forward. Her experience when gaming outside that team \u2013 with both teammates and opponents \u2013 hasn\u2019t always been as rosy. \u201dI\u2019ve had sexual remarks put towards me,\u201d she said. \u201dI get told I should be back in the kitchen. \u20182K is not for women,\u2019 I\u2019ve had that. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d Evans also got loud pushback on social media when she announced last month \u2013 on her 30th birthday, no less \u2013 that she\u2019d qualified for the draft. \u201dThat\u2019s the only time that it\u2019s been discouraging for me,\u201d Evans said. \u201dIn that moment, because it was a great moment for me, and I felt like people ruined it.\u201d Other gamers at Tuesday\u2019s draft were eager to welcome Evans and Novin. \u201dMale, female, dog, cat, frog, I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Alexander Bernstein, a returning player with 76ers Gaming. \u201dIf you\u2019re the best in the world, I feel like you deserve to be able to play.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean the women won\u2019t face extra skepticism. Kimanni Ingram, another draft-eligible player, has played with Evans and respects the way she has navigated blowback from male gamers. But even his compliments Tuesday came with a qualifier. \u201dShe has the basketball IQ for a girl,\u201d Ingram said. \u201dMost people would be like, \u2018I\u2019m playing with a girl. She\u2019s not going to know what to do.\u2019 She knows what she\u2019s doing. You can tell.\u201d News of Evans\u2019 selection traveled fast. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked about her prior to a game against Boston. \u201dI think that\u2019s really cool that she\u2019s passionate and inspired and broke a barrier,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d \u201dEsports has become a huge thing now,\u201d said Kevin Durant, Evans\u2019 favorite player. \u201dMore people who enjoy the game might get an opportunity to be professionals and make some money for themselves and make some money. I think it\u2019s cool.\u201d Female gamers have had difficulty breaking into pro esports. Among the most popular circuits, League of Legends Championship Series and the Overwatch League have each had just one female player. Those women both received ample praise and criticism on social media. The NBA wants to help Evans and Novin manage that. The 2K League has a transition program based on the NBA\u2019s rookie symposium, and it added sessions specifically for Evans and Novin to help them navigate their potential barrier-breaking roles, including help with social media. One item 2K hopes to change soon: The video game still does not include any female players. Unlike EA Sports\u2019 NBA Live series \u2013 which includes WNBA rosters and the ability to create female players \u2013 NBA 2K is still male-only. Donohue says 2K is working to add women to future versions of the game. That\u2019s not bumming out Evans right now. She\u2019s already building out her to-do list for her new home in Oakland. \u201dI\u2019m going to see if I can do a real-life shooting competition with (Stephen) Curry,\u201d Evans said. \u201dThat\u2019s what I was known for. See if I can shoot with the best.\u201d"},{"id":35167,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/markelle-fultz-magic-no-timetable-return-season","date":"2019-03-06","title":"Report: Still no timetable for Markelle Fultz to return","content":" There is no timetable for when or even if guard Markelle Fultz will play this season for the Magic, according to a report by Roy Parry in the Orlando Sentinel.

The 113-105 loss to the crosstown LA Clippers dropped the Lakers to 30-34, putting them 5 1\/2 games behind the No. 8-seeded San Antonio Spurs . Even as it looks like the playoff deck is stacked against the Lakers, though, star forward LeBron James told ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin he has no intention of sitting out games to close out this season. \u201cThat would take a lot of convincing from Luke [Walton] on up,\u201d James told ESPN, referring to the Lakers coach as well as other key figures such as GM Rob Pelinka, team president Magic Johnson and governor Jeanie Buss. \u201cUnless I\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m not sitting games. \u201cThat conversation hasn\u2019t occurred, but I\u2019m sure it can happen soon,\u201d James told ESPN. James missed 18 games \u2014 a stretch spanning from Christmas Day to Jan. 31 \u2014 because of a left groin strain . The Lakers beat the Clippers on Jan. 31 and stood at 27-25, which put them No. 9 in the West and well within striking distance of the conference\u2019s lower playoff seeds. Since then, the Lakers have gone 3-9 \u2014 a stretch that includes their current three-game losing streak and losses in five of their last six games overall. Last night, James had 27 points, eight rebounds and six assists in 42 minutes. After the game, he admitted that monitoring his playing time \u2014 if not resting completely \u2014 could be a possibility moving forward. \u201cYou kind of look at the rest of the games, and look at the percentages of what\u2019s going on there in the future, and see what makes more sense for not only me but the team itself as well,\u201d James said. James is closing in on Michael Jordan for No. 4 on the all-time scoring list and needs 13 points to pass him. The Lakers\u2019 next game is Wednesday, when they host the West\u2019s current No. 2 seed, the Denver Nuggets ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). \u2018You keep playing to the end and see what happens,\u201d James said. \u201dI\u2019ve been talking about it for a while now.

Ingram had played in 50 straight games, averaging 18.3 points and 5.1 rebounds in a strong first season alongside James. Lonzo Ball was already out with his long-term ankle injury, leaving James without his two most important teammates. Kyle Kuzma then scored 13 points before he limped off the floor with an apparent ankle injury with 6:04 to play, and coach Luke Walton said he \u201dwould be surprised\u201d if Kuzma\u2019s injury doesn\u2019t force him to miss the Lakers\u2019 next game.

When LeBron James chose Los Angeles as the place to re-root his family and build his side hustle in entertainment and yes, contend for NBA championships, he never bothered to explain why he chose one L.A. team over the other. And most likely, you never bothered to wonder. You knew. Such is life here, where the blue sky is repainted purple and gold, where the basketball statues out front of Staples Center all share the same uniform, where the track record for success and rich hoops history leans too far in the direction of the Lakers, crushing the Clippers in the process. When the season began, the Clippers merely moved forward once again in the shadows of the nearby circus, far under radar and beyond the glare, sharing the same arena as the Lakers but not the same platform. This is why today feels so \u2026 what\u2019s the word \u2026 gratifying? \u2026 for the L.A. Team Not Fit For A King. The Clippers are actually doing this, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re about to keep the Lakers and LeBron from making the playoffs. The teams played Monday in what became the unofficial sign-off for the Laker season after the Clippers grabbed a shovel and buried the body, 113-105 , at Staples. Not only did the Lakers deal with boos from the home crowd, but they played without Brandon Ingram and his bum shoulder and then lost Kyle Kuzma with six minutes left to an ankle sprain. The Clippers\u2019 resident pit bull, Patrick Beverley, stayed chippy from the tip to set the tone for his teammates, giving away four inches and 75 pounds while checking LeBron, yet keeping that same intensity to the buzzer. By then, half the crowd was beating traffic. With 18 games left, a 5 1\/2-game deficit for the West\u2019s final playoff position and losses in seven of their last nine, the Lakers have checked out and packed up. And oh, it\u2019ll get even sweeter for the Clippers if they have a better summer than the Lakers, too, when it will be Jerry West vs. Magic Johnson. Suddenly, any and all is possible, because these are not your Donald Sterling Clippers. Based on three-fourths of a season\u2019s worth of evidence, you wonder if and when these will ever be your Jerry Buss Lakers. \u201cI knew coming into this year it would be different from the previous year,\u201d said James, almost resigned to watching the playoffs from home. A decade ago, if you knew a team in L.A. had a coach on the hot seat, a star player feeling beleaguered, suffered from a string of embarrassing losses and was cloaked in controversy, there would be no question which L.A. team that was. But welcome to the 2018-19 season, where there\u2019s been a twist of fate and the Clippers are frisky, free and staring at an upcoming offseason that might become a launching point for the franchise. They don\u2019t have LeBron, and yet they also don\u2019t have the LeBron-created climate that has the Lakers on edge. They are in serious jeopardy of missing the playoffs, which seemed unlikely when James brought his talents to L.A. last summer. That decision supposedly signaled a new renaissance for the team with 16 championships and continued a parade of superstars to play for the Lakers, which started with West and Elgin Baylor some 60 years ago. Life comes at you fast, and LeBron found himself dealing with distracted teammates he tried to send to New Orleans in a failed coup for Anthony Davis and a coach in Luke Walton he doesn\u2019t appear to enthusiastically endorse, along with a first season with the Lakers that\u2019s going up in smoke. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take care of business tonight,\u201d James said. \u201cBut you keep playing to the end and see what happens. At the end of the year, the chips will fall where they may. We\u2019re in a results league. You take the good with the bad and keep pushing forward.\u201d Missing the playoffs will be an ego blow for the Lakers, and for LeBron, his first non-playoff season since 2004-05. The Lakers wouldn\u2019t be in this position had LeBron not missed 18 games with a groin pull, and this team has never been fully healthy since Thanksgiving. Yet that doesn\u2019t forgive losses to the Knicks, Grizzlies, Suns, Hawks and others. It would come as doubly depressing should the Lakers sit home this spring while L.A. throws its support behind the Clippers in the postseason, especially since the Clippers were all but left for dead \u2014 and tanking \u2014 after trading Tobias Harris to the Sixers weeks ago. But the Clippers, unlike the Lakers, play hard for their coach and are 7-3 since the trade. As for tanking, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said the locker room never gave that any serious thought. \u201cThat was never going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have lost (games) but we weren\u2019t going to tank. I think people didn\u2019t believe we couldn\u2019t do it even if we wanted to. That talk helped us, because that was a challenge. This is a group that takes pretty well to challenges.\u201d The Clippers weren\u2019t on LeBron\u2019s radar last summer, but maybe their free-agent judgment day is coming. They\u2019re positioned to take advantage of the market without sacrificing their core, making it tough for an A-list free agent to say no. They\u2019ve got a secure coach in Rivers who constantly ranks high in player popularity polls. They have a good supporting cast, all on team-friendly deals: Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Landry Shamet, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Beverley. If the Clippers were to find a taker for Danilo Gallinari\u2019s contract, it could create room for two max free agents. Also, they have an owner worth billions in Steve Ballmer who wants to crank up the noise, so neither money nor the luxury tax will be an issue. Finally, the Clippers can offer a free agent all the charms of L.A. without dealing with any of the runoff that often comes with being LeBron\u2019s teammate. You don\u2019t even need to examine his history closely to know that West, now an adviser for the Clippers, usually gets his man. And this summer will be an interesting backroom competition between \u201cThe Logo\u201d and \u201cMagic.\u201d The latter will be under pressure to fix the Lakers, given this season\u2019s collapse and also the three years left on LeBron\u2019s contract. This raises an important question for the Lakers: How will perspective free agents view the idea of playing next to LeBron? It won\u2019t matter in the event of a trade for Davis, who must go wherever the Pelicans send him. But a free agent? It\u2019s best not to suddenly diminish the Lakers on that front, because this franchise remains a destination \u2014 especially if they have money to spend (which they will). Free agents won\u2019t care about how the Lakers stumbled the year before. In this situation, money talks first and foremost. Just the same, placing too much emphasis on this season and projecting something deadly similar for the Lakers next season \u2014 assuming of course, good health for LeBron \u2014 is done at your own risk. But that\u2019s in the distance. For now, the Lakers are the No. 2 team in town, and all that\u2019s left is to observe LeBron\u2019s body language for signs of surrender as he plays out the meaningless string. LeBron gave no definitive answer about how much, if any, he\u2019ll play once the Lakers\u2019 demise is official. \u201cI\u2019ll continue being a professional and great as I can be every single night no matter the circumstances,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the other team in L.A. is fully activated, to borrow a LeBron term, for the next step. \u201cThere were seven people here to see us media day,\u201d said Beverley. \u201cI remember like it was yesterday. Like I said then, we\u2019re the best team in L.A. A lot of people didn\u2019t believe me. Probably still don\u2019t.\u201d He smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. That\u2019s who we do it for, the people in the back. The blue collar people who don\u2019t have anything given to them. Who work for everything they deserve. And we\u2019re getting ready for the playoffs.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Suns snapped that skid on Feb. 25 , then added their second victory in three outings with an upset of the Lakers last Saturday . So the question entering Monday\u2019s seemingly unwinnable home game against the NBA-best Bucks was obvious: Why stop there? Pulling off one of the league\u2019s most improbable upsets in decades, the Suns somehow prevailed 114-105 , erasing a 16-point deficit in the first half and finishing strong with a combination of effort and execution they\u2019ve lacked so often during yet another lost season. In doing so, the Suns \u2014 who trailed Milwaukee by 36 games in the loss column entering Monday\u2019s action, and 35 1\/2 games overall \u2014 became the first team to beat the Bucks more than once this season, while the Bucks suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time. Even more notably, it marked the first time since 1983-84, when the Indiana Pacers upset the eventual-champion Boston Celtics, that the NBA\u2019s worst team has beaten the NBA\u2019s best team more than 60 games into the season. (For reference, only one current Sun, 38-year-old Jamal Crawford, was alive at that point.) Despite a nip-and-tuck third quarter, in which the lead changed hands six times, the Bucks finally appeared to have things under control as they built up a 10-point lead midway through the fourth. But despite having nothing to play for but pride, the Suns slugged back with a 31-12 surge over the final 7:37. Kelly Oubre was the unlikely star, scoring 27 points, pulling down 13 rebounds and making a critical late defensive play, stripping the ball off Bucks center Brooks Lopez and out of bounds as the Suns defended a four-point lead with 31.5 seconds left. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to think we lost to Phoenix twice,\u201d said the shell-shocked Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was limited to 21 points. \u201cBut they played better than us. They came out there and set the tone.\u201d Making the victory even sweeter, it followed a report from ESPN posted earlier in the day detailing the franchise\u2019s descent into dysfunction with nine straight playoff absences. It will take an exhaustive effort to reverse that decay. But for one game at least, things felt a little brighter in the Valley of the Sun. The Bucks weren\u2019t the only playoff team to blow a big lead to a team playing out the string. They were joined by the Jazz, who were powerless to prevent the visiting Pelicans from erasing a 17-point deficit en route to a 115-112 victory . While plays like this from Anthony Davis certainly helped \u2026 \u2026 the Pelicans largely did it without their presumably soon-to-be-departed superstar. Indeed, for the fifth time in the past six games, they were actually better without him when it mattered most. Maybe life in the Big Easy won\u2019t be so bleak without Davis? As has been the case throughout his final season, Heat legend Dwyane Wade exchanged jerseys with an appreciative opponent. As strange as this one might have seemed, however, it was actually one of the coolest yet. We\u2019ll let D-Wade explain: If there have been two constants during the Gregg Popovich era in San Antonio, they are winning and defense. While the Spurs are still doing the former, the latter has suffered a precipitous drop off as they\u2019re on pace to finish below league average in defensive efficiency for the first time since 1996-97 \u2014 Popovich\u2019s first season at the helm, and the last time they failed to make the postseason. A 22nd straight playoff berth is still in question, but the Spurs did themselves a huge favor with a 104-103 victory in which they managed to keep the high-octane Nuggets in check. While it didn\u2019t come easy \u2014 the Spurs came within one possession of squandering an 18-point, fourth-quarter lead \u2014 they still earned praise from Popovich for holding the Nuggets to nearly five points less than their usual offensive efficiency. \u201cTo get them to score 103, I\u2019m thrilled with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe defense was solid.\u201d It was not a banner night for the Mavericks in Brooklyn, where the Nets pounded them by 39 for their most lopsided home win since moving from New Jersey in 2012. That didn\u2019t stop Kia Rookie of the Year favorite Luka Doncic from adding to his highlight reel with yet another amazing play:"},{"id":35171,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-rockets-play-preseason-games-japan","date":"2019-03-05","title":"Raptors, Rockets to play preseason games in Japan","content":"MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Toronto and Houston will play a pair of preseason games in Japan next season.

Originally selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2010 NBA Draft out of Kentucky, Bledsoe holds career averages of 14.0 points, 4.8 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game.

Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes reports Bogut intends to sign with the Golden State Warriors once he receives a letter of clearance from the Sydney Kings of Australia\u2019s National Basketball League. Bogut played for the Warriors from 2012-16, winning an NBA title with them in 2015 and reaching The Finals in \u201916 \u2014 a series Golden State lost. Per Haynes, the clearing process for Bogut is expected to take 48 hours. Bogut was a standout in the ABL, winning league MVP honors last season. Via Twitter, Charania tweeted Monday that \u201c The Golden State Warriors have emerged as the frontrunners for Andrew Bogut, league sources tell @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. Bogut\u2019s representatives are working this week through letter of clearance process from Australia\u2019s Sydney Kings.\u201d Charania reported on Sunday that \u201cmultiple contenders\u201d were chasing Bogut, including the Philadelphia 76ers. Bogut, who most recently played for the Lakers in 2017-18, is coming off a standout campaign Australia\u2019s NBL in which he won the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year awards. Originally drafted first overall by Milwaukee in 2005 , the 7-foot big man holds career averages of 9.8 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game. He signed with the NBL last April and planned to play two seasons with the Kings, saying then there were \u201cno outs\u201d in his deal if an NBA team should become interested. \u201cBefore anyone asks, no NBA outs, no European outs,\u201d Bogut said at his news conference in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m committed to being here for two years \u2026 it will retire me from the NBA, I\u2019m happy to say that today.\u201d After being waived by the Lakers in January of 2018, it was expected the free agent would join a contending team for a playoff push.

He tweeted that his wife\u2019s pregnancy with their second child has been deemed \u201chigh-risk\u201d and she\u2019s not allowed to travel.

He was acquired by Cleveland in the second half of last season, but he fractured his left leg less than a minute into his debut with the Cavaliers.

Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Lakers have paused talks on a possible contract agreement with the Anthony unless the team makes a turn toward the playoffs. After Saturday\u2019s loss to the Phoenix Suns (as well as other games since then), the Lakers are No. 10 in the Western Conference . They are 4 1\/2 games behind the No. 8-seeded San Antonio Spurs and have one of the most difficult schedules remaining in the West.

For now, makes more sense for Lakers to use minutes on young players than a 34-year-old FA.\u201d Anthony was waived by the Chicago Bulls on Feb. 1 , nine days after he was traded there by the Houston Rockets.  The Bulls had no plans to play Anthony had been looking to either trade the 10-time All-Star before the Feb. 7 deadline or ultimately waive him and make him a free agent.

Its record went to 41-22, no small feat considering All-Star guard Victor Oladipo\u2019s season ended on Jan. 23 with a ruptured right quadriceps tendon. The Pacers, without their best player, had beaten a bunch of contenders \u2014 Boston, Philadelphia, Houston, Oklahoma City\u2013 to 40 victories and still were going. So as the two men left the building \u2014 Pritchard, 51, Indiana\u2019s president of basketball operations and Walsh, 78, the lifer now serving as a consultant \u2014 Walsh turned to Pritchard and said, \u201cWell, Kevin, you\u2019re not going to have a losing season.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much the Pacers\u2019 way. No sweeping pronouncements about the season, no predictions of playoff success. Just a snapshot of the moment, simple math in a one-day-at-a-time approach. For the rest of us, it\u2019s entirely legitimate to assess Indiana\u2019s 2018-19 season overall, to respect the Pacers\u2019 consistency and to marvel at their ability to absorb the blow of Oladipo\u2019s loss and keep going. Pritchard, the native of Bloomington, Ind., nearing the second anniversary of when he took over for Larry Bird in the team\u2019s basketball hierarchy, spoke recently with Steve Aschburner of NBA.com about another overachieving season.  * * * Steve Aschburner:  I\u2019m not sure whether you guys are the Little Engine That Could or Monty Python\u2019s Black Knight , but what\u2019s the key to your resiliency? Kevin Pritchard:  I really think it starts with what we\u2019re about. Our guys, on a consistent basis, do a couple things: they play hard and they play together. That\u2019s really a testament to [coach] Nate [McMillan] and our coaching staff. Every night, I feel like we give ourselves a chance. We may be not the most talented team, but we try to make up for it by doing the small things well. They\u2019re a competitive group. They believe in each other, and I think they believe in playing the right way. There haven\u2019t been but a handful of games this year where I thought, \u201cMan, we didn\u2019t play super-hard tonight.\u201d SA:  No offense, but the Pacers \u2014 in this era of multi-star Super Teams \u2014 aren\u2019t very \u201csexy.\u201d Is there room for a serious contender going about its business like this? KP:  What we evaluate is, when we look at players, we look at what we\u2019re about. We have some things we feel very strongly about in our culture, and that kind of drives every decision. Sometimes that maybe knocks out the \u201csexy\u201d pick, but it makes us take a hard look at what fits. Our players have done a great job also of establishing what they\u2019re about and holding the locker room accountable. SA:  So the Pacers sometimes get to do the choosing, rather than always hoping to be chosen, by a talented free agent? KP:  I don\u2019t think it comes down to turning down anybody. I think we know what we are in Indianapolis. That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t go after the big names, but when we do our evaluations, we ask ourselves a few questions and if they don\u2019t fit, we mark that. \u201cOK, let\u2019s evaluate the rest of the talent pool.\u201d I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the right way, but it\u2019s the way we do it. SA:  In games Oladipo was hurt last season, your team was 0-7. As we speak this season, you\u2019re 16-11. What\u2019s the difference, as far as dependency? KP:  We overachieved overall last year. We made a pretty big trade [ Paul George for Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis ] and it worked out for both teams, and that made my job easier coming into this season because we wanted to keep some continuity. Continuity has allowed those guys to get comfortable with each other and gain some confidence. After we had a few wins without Victor, they had a better sense they could win if they played the right way. SA:  You lost your first four after his injury in January, then won nine of the next 12. KP: That\u2019s a real credit to Nate McMillan. You think about juggling as many lineups and dealing with as many changes as we\u2019ve had the last few years, he has done a great job of maximizing the talent. Our staff has great cohesion and this is a tribute to the job they\u2019ve done. SA: Nate\u2019s getting mentioned as a Coach of the Year candidate. Why is he good at his job? KP: Just the consistency. He prepares. He brings the same work ethic every single day and that trickles down to the team. He sees the game in a way he wants it to be played. When it\u2019s not played that way, he lets them know. And I think Nate has had a little bit of a rebirth with his third team now. He\u2019s able to make adjustments. SA: According to some analytics I\u2019ve seen, some of your most efficient five-man lineups have been ones without Oladipo. How does that work? KP: Yeah, I\u2019m not sure I would subscribe to the theory that we have more better lineups without Victor. My eyes would tell me we\u2019re a lot better team when he plays. SA:  How is Oladipo doing in his rehab? KP:  Great. He has hit the reset button and attacks every single day the best he can. He\u2019s getting shots up sitting down in a chair. Whatever Victor can do, he will do \u2014 times a factor of 10. I spent two days with him down in Miami. During that time, he was texting and calling a lot of our guys. I think he stays in really close contact with our team on a daily basis. SA:  In his absence, have you seen any other individuals step up and take more responsibility? KP:  It feels like Thad [Young] has really stepped up into that captaincy role and become more vocal. We have a leadership group with Darren [Collison] and Bojan and now Wes Matthews, along with Myles Turner and Sabonis, they\u2019ve all stepped in. I\u2019m not sure we have one guy who has a dominant voice \u2014 it feels like this team polices itself in holding everybody accountable. SA:  What was your sales pitch to Matthews? KP:  He saw opportunity, right? We needed a starting two. And there was continuity with just knowing Nate and how he coaches, his style [Matthews and McMillan were together in Portland for 1 1\/2 seasons]. And from what he\u2019s told us, he saw us, he played against us and he liked the way we play. But it became a recruiting process, for sure. He had a lot of options. SA:  The Pacers are at or near the top in a number of defensive metrics, from defensive rating and points allowed per game to opponents\u2019 field goal percentage and sheer fouling . What\u2019s the secret of that success? KP:  Dan Burke is our defensive coach . He should get a lot of credit. And it\u2019s the fabric of what we are. Before we walk out to practice, I can assure you all of our coaches have thought about defense first. It\u2019s their nature, it\u2019s the way we evaluate film, it\u2019s the way we look at players. It\u2019s kind of who we are. SA:  So how has this gone for you in Year 2 in your current role?  KP:  I think this is my ninth year here. It seems short but it\u2019s been a while. I work with Donnie Walsh and Larry Bird [advisor to the Pacers president] on a daily basis, and both guys are true mentors for me. Donnie\u2019s in the office every day. Larry\u2019s here in the fall, then he\u2019s back for the Draft and free agency \u2014 he\u2019s very involved. I think he really enjoys this team. SA:  OK, but what have you learned about the job and the business? For instance, you deftly navigated a situation that has gotten a lot of league attention lately \u2014 the star player who wants out. I know you called it a trade that worked out for both teams, but the challenge initially was to move Paul George without taking a serious step back . KP:  I think the biggest thing is, you\u2019ve got to get in a room with your staff and your coaching staff, and have a good, hard debate about everything you do. You have to board out the noise and try to do what\u2019s right. SA:  There\u2019s a lot more noise as you call it than there used to be. It\u2019s unfathomable now, for example, that Kareem Abul-Jabbar could have asked for a trade back in 1974 and his boss in Milwaukee, Wayne Embry, could keep it quiet for a whole season. KP:  Oh my gosh, [the noise is] almost infinite now. You can almost guarantee tomorrow that there\u2019s going to be more [off-court] stories.  SA:  What\u2019s your assessment of the group you added last summer : Tyreke Evans, Doug McDermott and Kyle O\u2019Quinn? KP:  They fit in nicely. They all made it clear that they wanted to come in, play a role and do it as well as they possibly could. Kyle is a great backup center, and we\u2019ve asked him to be the third center. We\u2019ve needed him, because Sabonis is going to be out for a little bit. McDermott, as he gets comfortable here and learns to seek out his offense, the better he\u2019s going to be. And Tyreke, he\u2019s had some ups and downs. But when he plays well, we\u2019re a different team. We need that punch off the bench, and that\u2019s something we focused on when he got him. SA:  How do you know from night to night whether he\u2019s going to provide that? KP:  I can\u2019t tell that for the whole team. You just never know. SA:  [TJ] Leaf had a big game against Minnesota Thursday [18 points]. He was the No. 18 pick in 2017 [ahead of prospects such as Brooklyn\u2019s Jarrett Allen, Toronto\u2019s OG Anunoby and the Lakers\u2019 Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart]. Do you still see in him the player you projected? KP:  We\u2019re really high on him. He has paid his dues. He got stronger last year. The physicality of the game was a little bit of a challenge \u2014 that\u2019s not his challenge anymore. He\u2019s got a real offensive feel. He\u2019s one of our best in the post. He has a patience about him. He can go either way \u2014 he can pass. We think he\u2019s got a shot to be a really nice NBA player because he just works so hard. The game is slowing down for him. SA:  Bogdanovic got a lot of attention on the Timberwolves broadcast as a player who could help a bunch of teams. With six or seven of your top 10 heading into free agency , what impact is that having on your immediate and longer-term futures? KP:  It\u2019s good in that guys are pretty motivated. I\u2019ve believed in this team. We\u2019re going to be challenged in the playoffs and it will be fun watching them, but we\u2019ve got to get there first. I don\u2019t want to look too far in the future. We know we\u2019re going to have some tough decisions this summer. But I believe 40 percent of the league will be free agents, so it\u2019s not only our issue. It\u2019s a league issue and an opportunity. SA:  Did your fan base need to be persuaded, after Oladipo went down, not to bail on this season? Or did they remember how plucky the Pacers were in nearly upsetting Cleveland last spring and sign on for more of the same? KP:  That\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve had great fans the last two years. We\u2019ve been a tough out at home. And our fan base is educated. They know basketball, and I think they respect when they see a team play hard, whether it\u2019s a win or a loss. You can\u2019t fool \u2018em. And we don\u2019t try to fool anybody. SA:  We haven\u2019t seen Indiana opt for the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d approach to team building. KP:  You\u2019ve got to give Herb [Simon, team owner] a ton of credit. He\u2019s not the kind of guy who says, \u201cLet\u2019s tank and look to the future in three years.\u201d We\u2019re not about that. SA:  This is such a bottom-line business. But considering everything that\u2019s happened already, can you take satisfaction now in what your team has accomplished? Or does it necessarily have to wait until the end, with so much determined by your last game? KP:  I\u2019d rather you ask me at the end of the year. I know we\u2019re not going to have a losing season, though. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The victory they earned on Monday not only kept the Pistons perfect since the All-Star break, but was a win against a top-seeded squad they could face come the actual postseason. Raptors 118, Celtics 95 \u2014 The Raptors entered Tuesday\u2019s showdown needing a win to tie the season series with the Celtics. In the process, they sent a decided message to a fellow East favorite, too. Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry got the starters rolling, while Marc Gasol came through with some critical points off the bench to fuel a blowout victory. Nuggets 121, Thunder 112 \u2014 This is the time of year when division matchups matter most. Thanks to Nikola Jokic, Denver once again proved its might in the Northwest Division chase. Denver improved to 3-0 against OKC to clinch the season series as well as build a four-game lead in the division chase. Hawks 131, Wolves 123 \u2014 Atlanta, in the opinion of many, has little to no reason to aim for success this season. Don\u2019t tell that to youngsters Trae Young and John Collins, though. They both put up 30-point games on Wednesday, serving to both spoil some of Minnesota\u2019s playoff hopes and also provide a look at a potentially bright combination in the Hawks\u2019 future. Heat 126, Warriors 125 \u2014 It had been more than two months since Dwyane Wade went bananas from 3-point range in a win. Fittingly, he did so against the defending champions on Wednesday night, with 3-pointer No. 5 coming in the most astounding way possible. His one-legged, off-the-glass, straightaway 3-point heave dropped the Warriors in what might have been the best shot of 2018-19. Bucks 141, Kings 140 (OT) \u2014 Milwaukee is a team that is much more than Kia MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, and it proved that in spades against Sacramento. With Antetokounmpo resting under a minutes restriction and fellow All-Star Khris Middleton hobbled, guards Eric Bledsoe and Malcolm Brogdon saved the day in a thrilling win vs. the Kings. Rockets 121, Heat 118 \u2014 Three days after his 30-point scoring streak ended, James Harden got his newest such streak to two in grand fashion. He dropped 58 points and 10 assists on the Heat in a comeback win, the seventh such game in his storied career. He nailed eight 3-pointers and overall was unstoppable no matter who guarded him on Thursday night. Sixers 108, Thunder 104 \u2014 Before this one began on Thursday, it seemed like somewhat of an even game based on who wouldn\u2019t be playing (Paul George and Joel Embiid). No one told that to Tobias Harris, who put the Sixers on his back with 32 points and several clutch buckets late in the fourth quarter to help Philly to its first-ever win in Oklahoma City. Bulls 168, Hawks 161 (4 OT) \u2014 Don\u2019t tell Atlanta and Chicago they\u2019re only playing for Draft lottery positioning. Given the effort and scoring performances from both teams on Friday, it looked like much more was on the line for both squads. Trae Young set a Hawks rookie record with 49 points, making 17 of 33 shots (including six 3-pointers). Not to be outdone, the Bulls\u2019 Zach LaVine had a career-high 47 on 17-for-35 shooting with six 3-pointers. Raptors 119, Blazers 117 \u2014 Last week, Kawhi Leonard came up with a big steal and bucket, clinching a Raptors\u2019 win against San Antonio (and on DeMar DeRozan\u2019s return night). This week, Leonard was up to those tricks again, this time vanquishing Portland with a game-winning bucket with 1.5 seconds left on Friday night. Warriors 120, Sixers 117 \u2014 Don\u2019t ever sleep on Stephen Curry. That was a valuable lesson Philly learned on Saturday, as it watched its fourth-quarter lead fizzle and fade thanks to Curry\u2019s exploits. After a mostly quiet game, the Warriors\u2019 star scored 11 of his 28 points in the final frame \u2014 including a critical 3-pointer \u2014 that sank the Sixers\u2019 hopes of scoring an upset win. Jazz 115, Bucks 111 \u2014 A Kia MVP contender doing all he can to preserve a win. A young superstar (and, perhaps, future Kia MVP type) refusing to let up. And one of the best finishes of 2018-19, too. This Saturday night showdown had it all from Salt Lake City, with Giannis Antetokounmpo going for 43 points \u2014 only to be bested by the Jazz\u2019s Donovan Mitchell dropping 46 points to lift the Jazz from a 17-point, fourth-quarter hole. Pistons 112, Raptors 107 (OT) \u2014 Before this Sunday showdown, the last time Detroit was .500 or better was the day after Christmas. Although Leonard sat this one out for Toronto, give the Pistons plenty of props for clamping down on the Raptors to get back to the break-even mark. Hawks 123, Bulls 118 \u2014 If you can figure out what got into the Hawks and Bulls this week, let us know. Two days after waging a four-overtime thriller in Atlanta, the teams met again in Chicago. While it wasn\u2019t marked by that same back-and-forth goodness, this one gets a nod here for the odd circumstances that led to Young getting ejected. After he made a 3-pointer in the third quarter, he stared at the back of Bulls guard Kris Dunn \u2014 and was promptly ejected. Strange stuff, indeed. Nikola Jokic (36 points, 4-7 3pt FG, 9 reb, 10 ast in 34 minutes) \u2014 The Nuggets\u2019 go-to guy was exactly that all night long in a critical win against the Thunder. Down the stretch Tuesday, Jokic came up with five free throws in the final moments and was looking to lead the way in crunch time for Denver. He scored a big layup with 1:36 left to give Denver a six-point lead and then nailed a bunch of clutch free throws to seal up the win. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (58 points, 16-32 FG, 8-18 3pt FG, 7 reb, 10 ast, 4 stl in 43 minutes) \u2014 Another one of those stat lines from the reigning Kia MVP that makes you shake your head. Pick an aspect and wonder: the 50 percent shooting (despite being the defense\u2019s No. 1 focal point), the 10 assists (that show off his extreme court vision) or the fact he put the Rockets on his back \u2014 again \u2014 to save them from a would-be defeat. | Watch | Video box score Trae Young (36 points, 9-22 FG, 8 reb, 10 ast in 43 minutes) & John Collins (34 points, 13-21 FG, 8 reb in 33 minutes) \u2014 We can\u2019t deny the Hawks\u2019 young combo a spot this week, not after the combined work they put in against the Wolves on Wednesday. From tasty alley-oops to both players showing off their 3-point range (they were a combined 4-for-9 on 3-pointers), this no doubt whet Hawks fans\u2019 appetites about the future. | Watch | Video box score  Rudy Gobert (20 points, 6-9 FG, 8-10 FT, 13 reb, 2 ast, 4 blk in 33 minutes) \u2014 This one gets a not simply because of the weight of the game. Utah had three playoff-caliber opponents this week and went 3-0  against the LA Clippers, Denver Nuggets and Milwaukee Bucks. This line Gobert put up started things off on Wednesday against the Clippers and helped turn heads in Utah\u2019s direction by week\u2019s end. Watch | Video box score Eric Bledsoe (26 points, 11-20 FG, 12 reb, 13 ast in 35 minutes) \u2014 Finals teams \u2014 as the Bucks hope to be come June \u2014 have a strength in numbers that shows up when things look bleak. Bledsoe personified that notion on Wednesday in Sacramento, as his huge triple-double staved off the Kings on a night when Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton played less than usual. | Watch | Video box score Trae Young (49 points, 17-33 FG, 6-13 3pt FG, 8 reb, 16 ast in 56 minutes) \u2014 This effort ultimately came in a loss, but you can\u2019t fault Young for much of it. In fact, this game on Friday would have ended a lot sooner were it not for Young\u2019s step-back 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds left that sent the game into its first of four overtimes. He also nailed a layup to send the game to OT No. 2 as well. Watch | Video box score Zach LaVine (47 points, 17-35 FG, 6-14 3pt FG, 9 reb, 9 ast, 2 stl in 55 minutes) \u2014 When the Bulls look back on 2018-19, it likely won\u2019t be filled with many pleasant memories. This Friday night classic, however, will resound if for no other reason than to help show LaVine might be ready to be the No. 1 guy in Chicago. | Watch | Video box score Donovan Mitchell (46 points, 15-32 FG, 5-10 3pt FG, 3 reb, 6 ast, 2 stl in 39 minutes) \u2014 Allow us to recap this performance with just one number: 17. That\u2019s the deficit the Jazz found themselves facing in the fourth quarter at home and the number of points Mitchell scored in that frame to power an amazing Utah comeback win. Which, for the record, gave Utah its 17th straight home win against Milwaukee. | Watch | Video box score \u201cI\u2019ve been in this position so many times and so many times you don\u2019t make the shot. And the one I make is a one-legged flick from my chest. It\u2019s crazy. Great to do it in front of fans.\u201d \u2014 Heat guard Dwyane Wade , after making his wild, game-winning 3-pointer on Wednesday \u201dEven if I don\u2019t score, I think I can bring something. I can make a good pass. I think the coaches are comfortable to call plays for me and I think the team trusts me.\u201d \u2014 Nuggets center Nikola Jokic We\u2019ve got the best record in the league for a reason.

You can already see. He has the `it\u2019 factor.\u201d \u2014 Bulls guard Zach LaVine , on Trae Young \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re out. It feels like we were in prison.\u201d \u2014 Suns guard Devin Booker , after Phoenix ended its 17-game losing streak \u201cThis is a bad loss, man. We feel like we were too casual. We\u2019ve got to grow. [Coach Steve] Cliff[ord] said a lot of stuff after the game. He said a lot of things.\u201d \u2014 Magic guard Evan Fournier , after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Cavaliers \u201cWe\u2019ve had some good moments.

Abdul-Jabbar, 71, put up 234 items, including four of his six championship rings, for auction, with most of the proceeds targeted for his Skyhook Foundation that sends children from economically-challenged backgrounds to summer camps focusing on science, technology and engineering. Per ESPN\u2019s report, Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 1986-87 championship ring with the Los Angeles Lakers drew the highest price of any item at $398,937.50. In addition, Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s other rings from the Lakers\u2019 1980s title runs accounted for four of the five highest sales at the auction\u2019s close. His 1985 championship ring sold for $343,700 while his \u201980 and \u201988 rings went for $245,000 each. The ball from the final NBA regular-season game he played in back in 1989 sold for $270,050. Three of Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s six MVP trophies \u2014 from \u201972, \u201974 and \u201976 \u2014 each sold for more than $120,000.  \u201cWhen it comes to choosing between storing a championship ring or trophy in a room, or providing kids with an opportunity to change their lives, the choice is pretty simple: Sell it all,\u201d said Abdul-Jabbar, in a statement explaining his aim. \u201cLooking back on what I have done with my life, instead of gazing at the sparkle of jewels or gold plating celebrating something I did a long time ago, I\u2019d rather look into the delighted face of a child holding their first caterpillar and think about what I might be doing for their future. That\u2019s a history that has no price.\u201d In addition to various items from his NBA playing days, Abdul-Jabbar was also auctioning off his class ring from Power Memorial High School, a pair of his iconic (game-worn) goggles, an ice bucket, a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, a VHS recording of his Hall of Fame induction in 1995 and various other awards from his past. Abdul-Jabbar, 71, is the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 38,387 points. When he left the game in 1989 at age 42, no NBA player had ever scored more points, blocked more shots, won more Most Valuable Player Awards, played in more All-Star Games or logged more seasons. In his storied career, Abdul-Jabbar was Rookie of the Year, a member of six NBA championship teams, a six-time NBA MVP, a two-time NBA Finals MVP, a 19-time All-Star, a two-time scoring champion and a member of the NBA 35th and 50th Anniversary All-Time Teams."},{"id":35232,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-sign-gasol","date":"2019-03-04","title":"Milwaukee Bucks sign Pau Gasol","content":"MILWAUKEE \u2013 The Milwaukee Bucks have signed center Pau Gasol to a contract. Gasol, who is in his 18th season in the NBA, is a six-time All-Star, four-time All-NBA selection and two-time NBA Champion. He\u2019s appeared in 1,223 games (1,150 starts) throughout his career with Memphis, the Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago and San Antonio and holds career averages of 17.1 points, 9.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.6 blocks per game. The 7-footer from Spain is shooting 50.7 percent from the field and 36.9 percent from three over the course of his career, and is one of only two active players, and one of 18 players in NBA history, to have 20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds in his career. Originally selected with the third overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Atlanta Hawks, Gasol spent the last three seasons of his career with the Spurs where he averaged 10.0 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game while shooting 47.8 percent overall and 44.4 percent from three. Prior to joining the Spurs, he was a two-time All-Star with the Bulls in both 2015 and 2016, made three consecutive All-Star appearances with the Lakers from 2009-11, and played in the 2006 All-Star Game as a member of the Grizzlies, where he spent the first 476 games of his career and won Rookie of the Year in 2002.

With Sunday\u2019s 112-107 overtime victory against Toronto \u2014 their ninth win in 11 games and fifth straight at home \u2014 Detroit has reached .500 for the first time since Dec. 26 and claimed the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 6 seed in one fell swoop. (Here\u2019s where we acknowledge Kawhi Leonard was rested, dropping the Raptors to 13-5 without their star forward.) Blake Griffin (27 points, seven rebounds) and Andre Drummond (15 points, 17 rebounds) led the way, boosted by twin 19-point performances from Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good basketball team,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cThey came out played hard the entire way, and they\u2019re known for playing that hard and playing aggressive and playing physical. I think we did a great job matching their intensity. All of our guys top to bottom, played tough.\u201d The key cog has been Drummond, he of the league-leading 51 double-doubles . During this 11-game run, Drummond has averaged 20.7 points, 16.1 rebounds, 2.2 steals, 2.1 blocks while shooting 62.2 percent from the field and a respectable 68.5 percent at the line. Overall, the team has produced a league-best offense (118.1 rating vs. their 107.5 overall mark) and its fifth-best defense (a 107.2 rating, closely hewing to their season line of 108) during their hot streak. Jackson catching fire has surely boosted that offensive jump \u2013 his true shooting percentage has been nearly 10 points higher during the streak. Detroit opened the run 22-29, slotted ninth in the East, two games back of Miami for a playoff place. Now, it\u2019s the Heat on the outside, and Detroit looking at a potential matchup vs. the third-place Pacers. \u201cBefore \u2026 the All-Star break, we found ourselves,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cWe know what it takes to win basketball games, and if we keep playing like that we\u2019ll be a very, very good team and go far in the playoffs.\u201d Drummond seems \u2026 not wrong about the former. Time will tell on the other bit. The Celtics were the latest victims laid waste by James Harden\u2019s buzzsaw season, with the Rockets guard going for 42 points in a 115-104 victory in which Houston nearly led throughout. The loss, though it doesn\u2019t much imperil Boston\u2019s playoff hopes \u2013 they sit No. 5 in the East, a comfortable six games ahead of the Pistons \u2013 seals their hold on the league\u2019s worst record since the All-Star break at 1-5. The Celtics\u2019 offense has evaporated, with Boston posting a league-worst 102.0 rating in those six games. Their defense only dropping from top-5 to top-10 provides little solace. Kyrie Irving, often expansive in his comments, pre, post and totally un-game-related, was notably terse in the locker room: The tl;dr a repeated refrain: \u201cJust gotta play better.\u201d He\u2019s right. With the Thunder (minus Paul George) somehow in danger of dropping a home game to the Grizzlies without Mike Conley Jr. on the court, Russell Westbrook dug deep, scoring 12 points in the final 6:23 to eke out a 99-95 victory . Crisis averted. But perhaps a little close to that fifth straight loss for comfort. After Sunday\u2019s action, the notable outcomes in the East left the Pistons sixth, the Nets seventh and Orlando ahead of Charlotte (by percentage points) as well as Miami (1\/2 game) for the eighth spot. Out West, Oklahoma City and Portland are tied for third (though OKC holds the head-to-head tiebreaker ) with Houston but a game back on that crucial fourth seed and its opening round home court advantage. The Clippers, meanwhile, continue to hang above the cutoff. Here\u2019s how the board shakes out overall: Hawks rookie Trae Young, whose ridiculous shooting has finally caught up to his sublime passing at the NBA level was tracking for another top-tier stat line (18 points, five assists in 18 minutes) against the Bulls when this happened: Wait, what?! Here\u2019s the official explanation: Alex Len stepped up to score 28 points (five 3s!) in the 123-118 victory . As they say \u2013 and the refs actually directly reference here \u2013 it\u2019s never the first one that gets you tossed. Young and Kris Dunn had gotten friendly earlier in the game, setting the stage for implications to emanate out of the post-shot posturing. \u201cI hit a shot, and I just looked in the arena,\u201d Young said \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. They made the call; I\u2019ve just got to live with it.\u201d \u201cYou try to play with energy, passion, emotion,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor me, I was just having fun. That wasn\u2019t the first time I looked at someone after I hit a shot.\u201d Might not be the last, but mayyyybe not for a game or two to let that situation settle. For what it\u2019s worth, Dunn \u201cfelt like [Young] shouldn\u2019t have gotten ejected .\u201d #OnToTheNextOne"},{"id":35212,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/knicks-deandre-jordan-out","date":"2019-03-03","title":"Knicks' Jordan out vs. Clippers with ankle injury","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 New York Knicks center DeAndre Jordan is out of the lineup for their game against the Los Angeles Clippers.

Struggle through the first half of the season, awaken the beast that is Donovan Mitchell, rip off a huge late-season push. It\u2019s a familiar tune in Utah, one the Jazz played last year en route to the Western Conference\u2019s No. 4 seed. They\u2019re remixing the same song now, its key note (thus far) ringing clear after an improbable 115-111 comeback over the league-best Bucks on Friday. Mitchell was front-and-center in Utah\u2019s erasing of a 17-point, fourth-quarter deficit. The second-year guard, whose early-season struggles were well documented, netted 19 of his career-high 46 points in the final quarter. Remember the Mitchell of last season, the one that would take (and make) the kind of shots reserved for eight-year veteran All-Stars? He\u2019s back. So are the Jazz, who once languished as low as 14th in the West. Now they are sixth and climbing, just two games back of third-place Oklahoma City. Mitchell\u2019s making it happen. This isn\u2019t to discount Rudy Gobert, whose return from injury last year was the catalyst to Utah\u2019s 2017-18 about-face. Yet as important as Gobert is on defense, Mitchell is just as vital to the offensively challenged Jazz. Now, finally, it appears he and Utah are the player\/team everyone thought they would be entering the season. Because the West wasn\u2019t absurd enough already. We\u2019re not used to seeing the King like this. Below .500. In danger of missing the playoffs. Compiling stats, yet producing viral gaffes. The weirdness continued against the lowly Suns, against whom the playoff-hopeful Lakers fell, 118-109 . We can forgive the Lakers\u2019 committee of subpar centers for giving up 26 points and 10 rebounds to No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton. What\u2019s baffling was the lack of urgency with a much-needed win available against (by far) the worst team in their conference. LeBron showed up for a fourth-quarter push and finished with 27 points, 16 assists and nine rebounds. He also did this. While that might make this week\u2019s edition of Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool , the bigger eye-opener was James missing a pair of free throws with the Lakers down just five with 47.4 seconds remaining. The Lakers could hardly afford this loss \u2014 again, one they should not have suffered \u2014 to begin with. Now they\u2019re 4.5 games back of the eighth-place Clippers with 19 games to play. Beating those same Clippers on Monday would be a great way to wash the taste of Saturday night out of their mouths. Orlando, Miami and Detroit all left Saturday as winners, a huge deal in the standings traffic jam out East. The Magic would be in the playoffs if they started today, but the Heat are just a game behind both them and the Hornets. The Pistons, meanwhile, now sit in a virtual tie for sixth with the Nets. The distance separating all five of the aforementioned teams: just 2.5 games. It should only get nuttier from here . You know you\u2019re bringing up your kid right if he wants to be just like you. Shout-out to Dwyane Wade for acing that facet of parenting, as he and his son showed up to Saturday\u2019s game with identical hairstyles. Jrue Holiday is already acknowledged as one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, but this game-clinching steal against the contending Nuggets was borderline thievery."},{"id":35218,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-sign-dairis-bertans-official-release","date":"2019-03-03","title":"New Orleans Pelicans sign Dairis Bertans","content":" NEW ORLEANS \u2013 The New Orleans Pelicans announced today that the team has signed guard Dairis Bertans.

Easily the most anticipated game on Friday\u2019s schedule . Somehow, the Chicago Bulls\u2019 168-161 quadruple-overtime victory over the Atlanta Hawks turned out to be the most entertaining game of the night and the third-highest scoring affair in NBA history. Trae Young had the best game of his nascent career, pouring in 49 points and 16 assists . Zach LaVine countered Young\u2019s dominance with a 47-point, nine-rebound and nine-assist performance of his own. There was a ton to take away from this game, but what better way to summarize it than by putting both Young and LaVine in the same breath as all-time great Michael Jordan\u2026 isn\u2019t that how this works? Young became the first NBA rookie with 45 points and 10 assists in a game since Jordan in 1984. And LaVine\u2019s line of 47 points, nine rebounds and nine assists hadn\u2019t been achieved by any Bulls player since Jordan in 1989 . Seriously, the future\u2019s bright for these two up-and-comers.  Raptors star Kawhi Leonard reminded everyone why he\u2019s one of the best closers in the game. The All-Star forward leads the NBA with 5.0 ppg in clutch situations (score within five points in final five minutes) and lived up to his reputation on Friday, drilling a game-winning jumper over Damian Lillard to lift Toronto past Portland, 119-117 . The win snapped Portland\u2019s five-game winning streak. Leonard, who finished with 38 points on 63.6 percent shooting, scored 15 in the fourth on an efficient 75 percent shooting. Eleven of his 15 points came during clutch time. That type of production against above-average teams will bode well for the Raptors in the playoffs, especially when all of this is just considered practice for the former Finals MVP. Eric Bledsoe started his day by reportedly agreeing to a four-year, $70-million extension with Milwaukee. The ninth-year point guard ended the day by dropping a season-high 31 points against the Lakers, including the dagger 3-pointer that punched the Bucks\u2019 ticket to the playoffs. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bucks\/status\/1101723358343954432%20 The Bucks won their seventh game in a row and 10th straight on the road. With the Sacramento Kings losing to the LA Clippers, the Lakers had a shot to tie the Kings for ninth in the Western Conference standings. Instead, LeBron James & Co. continue to reside in the 10th spot, with the Minnesota Timberwolves trailing by one game.

Sidenote: This is the latest in a series of Lakers showing no mercy to their former teammates. Ingram just bodied Lopez, Kuzma recently threw down on Julius Randle and Ingram obliterated Corey Brewer for one of the most disrespectful dunks of the year. Someone warn Ivica Zubac before Monday\u2019s contest, please. Back to your regularly scheduled dunk session. One word: Giannis. Meanwhile, just south of L.A., Devin Booker laid the hammer on Anthony Davis for some Wildcat-on-Wildcat crime. The Curry brothers have apparently been trying to live above the rim as of late as well. Steph recorded his first dunk of the season last Friday, and younger brother Seth followed that up a week later with a throwdown of his own. It was the first time Seth dunked in his career, which certainly caught the eye of big bro.

Speaking at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference on Friday, Silver raised the idea of replacing the All-Star Game with a midseason or preseason tournament in which teams would compete for a separate championship, like they do in European soccer. Or groups of teams could compete in mini-tournaments in Asia or Europe. The problem, Silver said, is how to make these other events meaningful. \u201cThe All-Star Game didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said, calling it \u201can afterthought\u201d of the weekend despite changes like tinkering with the rosters through a player draft that was made public for the first time. \u201cI get it. We put an earring on a pig.\u201d The league is unlikely to make any changes \u2013 at least not any time soon \u2013 if only because a 70-game schedule like the one Silver discussed would require each team to give up six home games. Although players and coaches would love to see a shorter season, none is excited about taking a 20 percent pay cut. But the analytics conference in Boston\u2019s Bay Bay convention center gives Silver the opportunity to think aloud about ways to make the NBA better. In past years he has addressed possible changes to the draft to discourage teams from tanking, but this year\u2019s hot topic was New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis. Silver said Davis\u2019 public trade request (through his agent) was a problem for the league, but not all that different than other players who made the request behind the scenes. The more frequent shuffling of stars among teams was an unintended consequence of a collective bargaining agreement that was designed to shorten contracts so players wouldn\u2019t be earning huge salaries long after they were productive. \u201cMaybe that was a mistake,\u201d Silver said. Davis told the Pelicans he would not accept an extension, but the team did not trade him before the deadline and then mulled whether to sit him out to minimize the risk of injury \u2013 and maximize its draft position. He is expected to be traded over the summer. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad dynamic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess.\u201d"},{"id":35230,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pau-gasol-reportedly-sign-bucks","date":"2019-03-01","title":"Spurs part with Pau Gasol, who'll reportedly sign with Bucks","content":" SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 The San Antonio Spurs announced a buyout agreement with Pau Gasol on Friday, allowing the veteran center to become playoff-eligible with another team.

As a defender. \u201cMany times in the huddle, late in games, we\u2019ll say \u2018E, this guy\u2019s got it going on. You\u2019ve got to get him,\u2019 \u201d says Villanova assistant coach Kyle Neptune. \u201cCoach [Jay Wright] always wants Eric to check the other team\u2019s hot hand. It doesn\u2019t even matter what position it is.\u201d Some question whether Paschall \u2014 whose name has been turning up in the first round of some mock NBA Drafts \u2014 can be that effective a defender at the next level. The men who have coached him the last four years, counting a valuable redshirt season after Paschall transferred from Fordham in 2015, scoff at the naysayers. \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous,\u201d Neptune says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had elite defenders here \u2014 Josh Hart, Mikail Bridges \u2026 Donte Divincenzio was a good defender \u2014 but I\u2019d put Eric with any of those guys. The NBA is so much more isolations and making plays. I think Eric would be very good defensively in the NBA, right away. I don\u2019t think there would be any lag time.\u201d La Salle coach Ashley Howard, who served on Wright\u2019s staff as the Wildcats won two national titles, has a more succinct answer when asked if he thinks Paschal can guard at the next level. \u201cAsk Devonte Graham if he can\u2019t guard,\u201d Howard says. Villanova played Kansas in the Final Four last season, and Graham scored 23 points, meaning Wright had to dispatch Paschal to cool him off. The Wildcats eventually won 95-79. Long before he played as a Fordham freshman in 2014, Paschall earned the reputation of a scorer. And he didn\u2019t disappoint. The big man dropped 31 in his first college game, averaged 16 points and was voted the Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie of the Year. But after his coach, Tom Pecora, was fired in March 2015, Paschall decided he didn\u2019t want to stay around. Villanova had called Paschall just days before he signed with Fordham, so it was a natural place to resurface. His choice was astute. From the day he first stepped on campus \u2014 weighing 268 pounds with 18 percent body fat \u2014 Paschall went to work on his body under the watchful eye of John Shackleton, Villanova\u2019s excellent strength and conditioning coach who\u2019s also a nutritionist. Paschall used his redshirt year of 2015-16 wisely. As he watched the Wildcats win their first national title under Wright, he was toning and strengthening his body. By the time he was eligible to play the next season, Paschall was a ripped 251 pounds with six percent body fat. \u201cI give coach Shack a lot of the credit,\u201d Paschall says. \u201cWe lifted every day, he taught me how to eat right, and we worked on all the little things \u2014 lunges, box step ups, drills to help you get good mobility throughout your body.\u201d Paschall was a complimentary player as a sophomore in 2016-17, averaging 7.2 points. He knew there was more work to be done, so in between working with Neptune on his defensive skills, Paschall cranked up perimeter shots by the hundreds. Last season, when the Wildcats won another national title, he was a key starter, averaged 10.6 points and shot 35.6 from beyond the arc and 81.3 from the free-throw line. A year earlier, his averages were 27.9 and 69.5. Paschall derived just as much satisfaction becoming Villanova\u2019s lockdown man. \u201cIt\u2019s fun taking on all [defensive] challenges,\u201d Paschall said. \u201cAgainst quickness, I try to slide and use my length [6-foot-11 wingspan] to keep them in front of me. With big guys, I chest them. I use my strength when they try to back me down and not let them get to the spot where the want to.\u201d The NBA Draft claimed three starters \u2014 Bridges, point guard Jalen Brunson and post Omari Spellman \u2014 and key reserve Divincenzo \u2014 from that national championship team, leaving Paschall and fellow senior Phil Booth to carry on a proud tradition. The Wildcats began this season ranked in everyone\u2019s Top 25, fell out after improbable losses to Furman and Penn \u2014 which broke the Wildcats\u2019 25-game winning streak over Philadelphia Big Five competition \u2014 and have spent the rest of the year battling back. At 21-8 overall and 12-4 in the Big East, Villanova is poised to return to the NCAA tournament, thanks in large part to Booth and Paschall (16.8 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 36.8 from 3-point range). \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult with only two starters back,\u201d Paschall says. \u201cBut when all those guys left [all four of Villanova\u2019s Draft picks had eligibility remaining] we were happy for them. They got to follow their dreams. So Phil and I have had to do all the little things, and take over leadership roles to show the young guys what Villanova basketball is all about.\u201d Lately, Villanova basketball has been about winning championships and sending players to the NBA. Neptune and Howard think Paschall will be next in line. \u201cThe maturation of his career has been impressive to watch,\u201d Neptune says. \u201cHe started as a complete iso guy, just a volume shooter. He transitioned when he got here into more of a role player. You go your whole life, even the first part of college, being the guy, and now you have to learn to operate in a role. That\u2019s not easy. Over his first couple years here he did a great job finding his spots in the offense. \u201cThen he goes back to being the guy after not doing it in a while. It\u2019s another challenge, at the highest level of the game, being at the top of the scouting report. On top of that, when he\u2019s locked in and he\u2019s playing hard, no one in our program\u2019s been a better defender in terms of staying in front of guys. I think he\u2019s a plug-and-play guy in the NBA.\u201d Howard agrees. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be better in the NBA than he is in college because it\u2019s more of an open game,\u201d Howard says. \u201cEric can shoot, he\u2019s an NBA-caliber athlete, and he\u2019s a guy that can defend, legitimately defend, multiple positions. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen everybody in college basketball, but what guy other than [Duke freshman ] Zion Williamson has the size, the athletic skill and the explosiveness Eric does? He\u2019s a ready-made NBA player.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

His Houston Rockets were a league-best 48-13 at the end of February 2018 and were running through their competition \u2014 including the defending-champion Golden State Warriors. He was also closing in on his first Kia MVP after years of coming up short in the voting, which had to be a great feeling for Harden \u2014 no matter how much he\u2019d deny it publicly. W e all know how it ended for Harden and the Rockets (they ran out of gas in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals at home after leading the Warriors 3-2). They lacked the finishing kick needed to win a title. Harden is showing he\u2019s got that and more in this season\u2019s Kia MVP chase, adding yet another signature effort to an already unbelievable list of accomplishments. H e rallied the Rockets from a 21-point deficit against the Miami Heat on Thursday night , finishing with 58 points and 10 assists \u2014 his sixth 50-point game of the season . In doing that, he joins Wilt Chamberlain, Rick Barry, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant as the only other players to accomplish that feat. That\u2019s after he ran off 32 straight games with 30 or more points to drag the Rockets from the depths of the West standings to their current position: striking distance for a top-four spot . \u201c He\u2019s definitely one of the most unguardable players this game has ever seen,\u201d retiring Heat superstar Dwyane Wade said after Harden shot a blistering 16-for-32 from the floor, 8-for-18 from deep and a sterling 18-for-18 from the free throw line. L et all that sink in and then come up with an argument for someone taking the MVP hardware from Harden this season. If your compelling case doesn\u2019t begin with the word \u201cGiannis\u201d and end with the word \u201cAntetokounmpo,\u201d you probably can\u2019t do it. There\u2019s still plenty of season left for Harden or \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d to create a little separation, with the right finishing kick in this race. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  36.6 points, 7.7 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.2 steals Anytime you join Wilt Chamberlain, Rick Barry, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant as the only players to do something (six 50-point games in the same season), it warrants special attention. His feat Thursday also put the reigning Kia MVP alongside Tiny Archibald and Russell Westbrook as the only players with three 50-point, 10-assist games in a single season. Bottom line? Harden isn\u2019t conceding anything in this Kia MVP chase, with his finishing kick serving as proof. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni is piecing together rotations every night, providing room to manufacture load-management time for his superstar. And Harden, of course, isn\u2019t having it anyway. He made it clear last season that there would be no let up on his part and his latest effort is proof of that. Unlike last season, the Rockets don\u2019t have the added motivation of chasing the league\u2019s best record (and the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs) as motivation. But Harden doesn\u2019t appear to need anything added to his historical quest. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  27 points, 12.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.4 blocks Has the grind of this season finally caught up with \u201cThe Greek Freak?\u201d Perhaps. He sat out Monday\u2019s win in Chicago with a sore right knee. And he played only 24 minutes in Wednesday\u2019s wild overtime win in Sacramento on a Mike Budenholzer-mandated and enforced minutes restriction. It is shrewd planning by the Bucks\u2019 coach, who understands the kind of load-management routine works for his star (having seen it done for Tim Duncan during his days as a San Antonio Spurs assistant coach). Budenholzer is saving Antetokounmpo from his ambitious, 24-year-old self to ensure sure he\u2019ll have the energy and health needed for a deep playoff run. That said, anyone in Los Angeles expecting Antetokounmpo to coast tonight against LeBron James and the Lakers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) is dreaming. This is the perfect stage on which to help punctuate a season-long Kia MVP campaign. Granted, Antetokounmpo has already piled up plenty of highlights and statement moments. But spotlight tonight at Staples Center, given the circumstances for the Lakers, will be even brighter than normal. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.6 points, 8.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 2.3 steals Yet another casualty of the wear-and-tear of the NBA season, George sat out with a sore right shoulder Thursday night in OKC\u2019s home loss to the Philadelphia 76ers . It\u2019s the Thunder\u2019s third straight loss and third in four games since the All-Star break. George\u2019s absence was glaring against the Sixers, who also played without their anchor and MVP candidate, Joel Embiid . The Thunder\u2019s margin for error without George was on full display, and it should be noted for the postseason. The chase for playoff positioning, however, is a much more pressing concern for the Thunder. They\u2019ll need George back and rolling if they are going to hold off the Portland Trail Blazers for the No. 3 spot in the West . Like other superstars league-wide, George must balance his need for physical breaks with his team\u2019s need to have (one of) its most dynamic players on the floor for the season\u2019s closing weeks. Last week:  No. 8 Season stats:  20.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.4 steals A statement effort by the Utah Jazz Thursday night interrupted the Nuggets\u2019 three-game, post-All-Star weekend chase for the top spot in the West. It also served as a reminder of just how tenuous a position Jokic and the Nuggets are in as they try to flip their script from playoff observer last season to West elite this season. Jokic did battle Rudy Gobert to a virtual standstill of elite big men (finishing with 16 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists to Gobert\u2019s 16 points, eight rebounds and four blocks). But the Nuggets\u2019 playoff hopes this season will rest largely on Jokic turning in more efforts like the one he had in Tuesday\u2019s win against Oklahoma City (a near triple-double with 36 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds). Jokic has made it clear that being in the MVP territory is a place he\u2019s not nearly as comfortable in as others on this list. But if the Nuggets are going to finish what they\u2019ve started, they\u2019ll need the big fella to embrace his Kia MVP-ness. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  28.4 points, 5.3 assists, 5.3 rebounds, 1.2 steals It\u2019s always a bit surprising to see the greatest shooter in NBA history struggle through an uncharacteristic slump. That\u2019s exactly where he and the Warriors are at on their current road trip. Even when Curry finishes with his normal output \u2013 as he did in Thursday\u2019s 103-96 loss to the Orlando Magic \u2014 it\u2019s hard to overlook his 3-point shooting woes. He had 33 points, yes, but was 5-for 17 on 3-pointers and went 4-for-14 on 3-pointers in consecutive games against Charlotte and Miami (which Golden State split) before that. These are first-world problems, of course. The Warriors have elite shooters\/scorers in Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. But when one of them is out ( as Durant was Thursday night ) or having an off night, Curry\u2019s importance to the Warriors is magnified. That the Warriors can maintain their status atop the West through all the twists and turns of a fifth straight championship-or-nothing campaign is a testament to the Warriors\u2019 talent. It also speaks to the standard Curry and Co. have established. In short, we\u2019re all just nit-picking where Steph is concerned. * * * 6. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 7.

How would Philly\u2019s incorporate No. 4, when they\u2019d already been dealing with \u201cBig 3\u201d issues? Could they actually pull it together in time for the playoffs without aggravating everyone? Harris, however, is making it all easy. He\u2019s been highly efficient \u2014 taking between 12 and 15 shots in each of his first six games before 16 on Monday, sinking a ridiculous 54.5 percent of his shots (37.2 3-point percentage). With Joel Embiid out on Thursday against the Thunder, Harris simply upped the attempts. Harris shot 11-of-19, sinking 5-of-7 triples, to finish with a game-high 32 points in a 108-104 victory . That marked the Sixers\u2019 first win in Oklahoma City, and also the end of a 19-game slide to the Thunder. What Harris has proven thus far is that he can be the immediate outlet \u2014 taking the open shots, or creating the space for others to get theirs \u2014 and also the cavalry charging in whenever the moment calls. He\u2019s had experience at all these things in a well-traveled early career, and could lock in a monster payday with (more than) a few clutch playoff performances. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see what roles teams envision him fitting. This one in Philly might just prove perfect. Meanwhile, on the OKC side, with Paul George out due to shoulder soreness (that was showing in his recent shooting), we got the 2017 usage rate out of Russell Westbrook, who took up 35.6 percent of Thunder possessions, up from 30.5 on the season. And, as he has all season, Westbrook struggled to shoot, knocking down only 8-of-24 overall and 1-of-9 on 3-pointers. Midway through the third, Ben Simmons officially gave Russ the full sag: With the missed triple, Simmons did it again on the next possession: And then again one after that \u2026 except \u2013 as Westbrook has done all season \u2013 he adjusted, creating a clean look for Steven Adams to push one through: Westbrook eventually tallied 24 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to notch yet another triple-double, making him the first player to hit three straight seasons with at least 25. He nearly brought the Thunder all the way back, though they ultimately dropped their fourth decision in five games. Consistency issues like these (the Thunder were 11-1 prior to the recent slump) have Oklahoma City feeling a rung below the top tier. But with Paul George producing at Kia MVP levels \u2013 Kevin Durant won the award with a similar line back in 2014 \u2013 and Westbrook enabling it by ceding just enough of the spotlight, they\u2019re likely to be a tough out for whoever ends up on their side of the bracket. Hey \u2013 remember that time James Harden missed 22 straight 3s? Me neither. Harden finished with 58 points, connecting on 8-of-18 (44.4 percent) behind the arc. His season output is officially expanding the limits of our basketball universe \u2013 he\u2019s carving out an unprecedented niche as a scoring playmaker, having put up his seventh career 50-point, 10-assist performance. No one else has topped three. Also of note: Harden\u2019s not the only Rocket entering rarified NBA air. With a third-quarter steal, Chris Paul entrenched himself as the fourth player to broach the league\u2019s all-time top 10 in both assists and steals, joining Jason Kidd, Gary Payton and John Stockton. https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoustonRockets\/status\/1101309606473723904 Also also: Dwyane Wade, still got it . And this was a nice moment: The Pacers. Just. Keep. Hanging. Around. Everyone thought they were cooked when Victor Oladipo went down, but they\u2019ve pulled together and no one\u2019s picked up more scoring slack than Bojan Bogdanovic, who\u2019s been averaging 21.2 points per game since. The fifth-year swingman dropped 37 points, seven rebounds and four assists on the Timberwolves, helping to overcome a 42-17 from Karl-Anthony Towns in a 122-115 victory . He also was apparently ready to take center stage from the jump. On a night the Orlando Magic dispelled the Warriors\u2019 strengths and took home a 103-96 victory over the defending NBA champions, the good vibes extended to the audience as a family of fans took home a $5K prize in a shooting contest. Donovan Mitchell, who struggled through the season\u2019s first 29 games (20.2 ppg while shooting just 29.0 percent from three and 40.6 percent overall) has resumed wrecking the league. Since December 21, he\u2019s averaging 25.8 points, shooting 36.4 percent from three and 43.4 percent overall. On Thursday, he served notice on the Nuggets\u2019 home court. Just as Denver was climbing back into the Western Conference showdown, Mitchell hit three straight buckets to quell the uprising and restore the victor their spoils.

Bagley will be re-evaluated in approximately one to two weeks. As the third quarter came to a close Wednesday, Bagley \u2014 shuffling to stay with his man on defense \u2014 was screened by Malcolm Brogdon. The unexpected impact resulted in an awkward fall that left Bagley clutching his left knee while crying out on the court. After about 90 seconds on the ground, he walked off the court with the help of teammates Harry Giles and Kosta Koufos. The team later indicated he wouldn\u2019t return to the game. Bagley finished with nine points and seven rebounds, playing 18 minutes in the Kings\u2019 eventual 141-140 overtime loss . He had his left leg immobilized in a knee brace after the game and did not speak with the media, but did talk to teammates. Earlier this season, Bagley missed 11 games in December after suffering a bone bruise in the same knee. \u201cYou just tell him to keep your head up,\u201d Koufos said, per Jason Alexander of The Sacramento Bee . \u201cHe\u2019s definitely an integral part of what we\u2019re doing this year. He\u2019s just a phenomenal player and a phenomenal person off the court, so you just want to be there as a teammate and try to help him. You have love for all of your teammates. We\u2019re a brotherhood and we look out for one another, and you just want everybody to be healthy.\u201d \u201cHe said he was good when he was walking back (to the locker room), so that takes a little edge off to know that he\u2019s not in too much pain,\u201d Kings center Willie Cauley-Stein said, per The Sacramento Bee . \u201cGames like that, when one of your soldiers goes down, you just try to win it for him, so that\u2019s what we tried to do.\u201d The Kings\u2019 loss, coupled with the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 win and LA Clippers loss on Thursday, keeps them at No. 9 in the Western Conference playoff chase. However, if Bagley misses an extended period of time, it may severely harm Sacramento\u2019s hopes of ending a 12-season long playoff drought. \u201cHe\u2019s 19 years old and he has a lot of basketball in front of him,\u201d Kings guard Buddy Hield said of Bagley. \u201cWe have to be cautious with him. If he plays on Friday, that would be great, but if he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ve got to go to war with whatever we\u2019ve got.\u201d Bagley, drafted No. 2 overall after Deandre Ayton, is averaging 14.0 points and 7.2 rebounds in 24.9 minutes through 46 games, and earned a spot on Team USA in the MTN DEW Ice Rising Stars at All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina. In one season at Duke, Bagley posted 21.0 points and 11.1 rebounds \u2014 shooting 61.4 percent \u2014 in 33.9 minutes, leading the Blue Devils to the Midwest Regional Final, where they lost to No. 1 ranked Kansas."},{"id":35273,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thunder-paul-george-out-shoulder-soreness","date":"2019-02-28","title":"Paul George out vs. Sixers with shoulder soreness","content":" * Tonight on TNT: Sixers vs. Thunder (8 ET) Oklahoma City Thunder forward Paul George will be sidelined due to right shoulder soreness when his team plays the Philadelphia 76ers tonight, the team announced on Thursday afternoon.

He did so when he first arrived in 1995, in trading for franchise stalwarts Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway . In 2004, he added an in-his-prime Shaquille O\u2019Neal to a burgeoning star in Dwyane Wade \u2014 a core that won Miami it\u2019s first NBA title in 2006. And he engineered the 2010 \u201cHeatles\u201d squad of Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh, all of whom helped Miami to four straight NBA Finals and titles in 2012 and \u201913. In an interview with Heat broadcaster Jason Jackson , Riley says he\u2019s targeting the summer of 2020 as perhaps his next chance to make a big splash with the roster. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this four times now, had a good group of players, young players, and then either through free agency or through trade brought the superstar in,\u201d Riley said . \u201cIn 2020, we\u2019ll have a lot of room. We\u2019ll also have the possibility to have enough room to go after two max contracts. And we\u2019re going to do that. So, we\u2019re planning that 2020 will be the room year. \u201cWe\u2019re very fluid. We\u2019re very on top of it. And we are a destination place, Jax. The tax, the sun, the beautiful city. It\u2019s a very progressive city, diverse city. So, we are a destination place. And we\u2019re going to be moving in that direction.\u201d In the interview, Riley praised the team\u2019s young core players such as Justise Winslow, Derrick Jones Jr., Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside and others. He knows chasing a playoff spot is likely the highest goal the team can hope to attain in Miami\u2019s remaining 22 games. After last night\u2019s stunning win against the Golden State Warriors , the Heat trail the Charlotte Hornets for the No. 8 seed by 1\/2 game . \u201cWe\u2019re chasing a playoff spot when we\u2019re young. And then we\u2019re going to be chasing some players that can come in,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIf we can get one or two players to come in with this group, this young group, then I think the sky\u2019s the limit for this team in the next couple years.\u201d After last season\u2019s first-round playoff exit, Riley had said the Heat would think big roster-wise if the opportunity presented itself. However, the Heat made mostly small moves last summer, chief among them re-signing Wade and fellow franchise icon Udonis Haslem. Wade is in the midst of his farewell season, one Wade termed his \u201cone last dance\u201d season. While the Heat have hovered around the .500 mark all season, Riley says missing out on the playoffs in hope of a better Draft position has never been his goal. \u201cI have never thought of anything else other than we want to be a playoff team. We want to think about the championship,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever give up on make the playoffs. \u2026 I don\u2019t care where you are, you get the right match-up, you get the right player that breaks through, you get the right call \u2014 and you\u2019re on to the next round. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re fighting for a playoff spot \u2014 the No. 8 or 7 or 5 or 3 or the top spot or you\u2019re fighting for a championship. You\u2019ve got to be chasing something positive.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":35305,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-nuggets-get-defensive","date":"2019-02-28","title":"One Team, One Stat: Nuggets' defense looking a bit more golden","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Jazz vs. Nuggets, 10:30 ET After missing the playoffs by the thinnest of margins last season, the Denver Nuggets are doing their best to make sure that there will be no doubt this time around. With 22 games to play, the Nuggets are just four wins from matching last season\u2019s total. After a big victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Denver has a five-game winning streak and a four-game edge over OKC for the 2 seed in the Western Conference. And thanks to Dwyane Wade\u2019s miraculous game-winner on Wednesday , the Nuggets are tied in the loss column with the first-place Golden State Warriors. The Nuggets have a tougher remaining schedule than the champs, with 13 of their 22 games against teams that currently have winning records. One of those games is Thursday, ( 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT ), when the Nuggets host the Utah Jazz. Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Nuggets as they try to extend their winning streak to six games \u2026 The Nuggets are the only Western Conference team that ranks in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency.  For the second straight season, the Golden State Warriors have not defended to their standards in the regular season. They have the most efficient offense we\u2019ve ever seen, but rank 16th on defense. The other three teams that rank in the top 10 on both ends are in the Eastern Conference. The Nuggets are barely in the top 10 defense, but that is a big step forward. Entering this season, Denver was one of just two teams \u2014 the Sacramento Kings were the other \u2014 that had ranked in the bottom 10 in defensive efficiency each of the last five seasons. And only three teams have improved more defensively from last season. An improvement of 2.1 points per 100 possessions may not seem that big. But as a whole, the league has scored 109.4 points per 100 possessions this season, up from 107.7 last season. So the Nuggets went from allowing 2.2 more points per 100 possessions than the league average to allowing 1.6 fewer than the league average. Improvement has come in a few different areas. The Nuggets have gone from 26th to 17th in effective field goal percentage, from 11th to fifth in defensive rebounding percentage, and from 22nd to 15th in opponent turnover rate. Shooting is the most important thing on both ends of the floor, so the drop in opponent effective field goal percentage is the biggest key to the step forward the Nuggets have taken. And where the Nuggets have improved the most is in their opponents\u2019 shooting from beyond the arc. The Nuggets (37.8 percent) ranked last in opponent 3-point percentage last season , the third straight year in which they ranked in the bottom four. This season, they rank fifth in opponent 3-point percentage, and no team has seen a bigger improvement. The Nuggets have actually seen one of the league\u2019s biggest increases in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from 3-point range. But there\u2019s a bigger correlation between overall defensive efficiency and opponent 3-point percentage than there is between efficiency and 3-pointers attempted\/field goal attempts. Opponent 3-point percentage can be noisy data. There\u2019s some luck involved and it can be more about the player shooting the 3-pointer than the team defending it. But there are ways that the defensive scheme and effort can make an impact. And the Nuggets\u2019 defense has been able to make more of an impact this season.  According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Nuggets have contested a greater percentage of their opponents 3-point attempts than they did last season. Also, 28 percent of their opponents\u2019 3-point attempts have been off the dribble, up from 25 percent last season. With the league shooting 37 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers and just 33 percent on off-the-dribble threes, forcing more of the latter can made a difference. Denver opponents have taken 29 percent of their 3-point attempts (the league\u2019s highest rate) from the corners, where league-wide 3-point percentage is higher (38.3 percent) than it is from above the break (34.8 percent). They almost lost in Memphis in late January when their pick-and-roll defense allowed Justin Holiday to drain a wide-open, weak-side corner 3-pointer for the lead in the final minute. But the Nuggets rank second in opponent 3-point percentage (32.5 percent) on those above-the break 3-pointers, which still account for more than 70 percent of the total threes that their opponents have taken. The Nuggets\u2019 defense has had its ups and downs this season. They ranked fourth defensively (104.1 points per 100 possessions) over the first nine weeks (through Dec. 16), but then ranked 27th (114.0) over the next eight (Dec. 17 \u2013 Feb. 10). They\u2019ve turned things back around, though, having allowed just 97.7 points per 100 possessions over their five-game winning streak, their best five-game stretch of defense since late November. Health has made a difference. The Nuggets have been without Gary Harris for 25 games this season. Paul Millsap was also out for most of December, when that defensive slide began. The Nuggets have allowed just 102.0 points per 100 possessions in 632 minutes with Harris, Millsap and Nikola Jokic on the floor together, even though most of those minutes have come against the opponents\u2019 starters. Harris is still coming off the bench, but improved health has been a factor in the Nuggets\u2019 five-game winning streak. Their opponents have shot just 43-for-165 (26.1 percent) from 3-point range over the five games, improving the Nuggets to 28-5 when their opponent has shot worse than the league average (35.4 percent) from 3-point range. They\u2019re 23-0 when their opponent has made less than 30 percent of its 3-pointers, something that happened just 13 times all of last season . The Nuggets\u2019 improved 3-point defense has shown up most in big moments. They\u2019re a league-best 24-10 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes , in part because they\u2019ve allowed the fewest points per 100 possessions (95.6) with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime . Their opponents have shot just 15-for-70 (21 percent \u2013 the league\u2019s second lowest opponent mark) on clutch 3-pointers (that Holiday three noted above was the exception to the rule, apparently). The winning streak (which includes two clutch wins) has pushed the Nuggets back into the top 10 in defensive efficiency, a benchmark for teams hoping to make noise in the postseason. Of the 44 teams to reach The Finals in the 23 seasons for which we have play-by-play data\u2026 It\u2019s been 10 years since the Nuggets won a playoff series and six years since they made the postseason. They\u2019re still a few steps away (with the Warriors\u2019 dynasty being a major road block) from even thinking about The Finals. But climbing from the bottom 10 to the top 10 on defense is a step already taken.

Torrey Craig (28.7 percent) has the fifth worst mark among the same group. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.
