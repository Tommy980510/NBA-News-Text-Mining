Fun fact: He can\u2019t dance. But the three-time champion and 12-time All-Star can still play, and the Miami Heat are hoping \u2013 and expecting \u2013 Wade to still be extremely valuable in this, his 16th and last season in the NBA. And at Heat media day Monday, Wade said that even he doesn\u2019t know what to fully expect from what will be the last months of his playing career. \u201cI have no idea what I want out of this year,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to figure this thing out as the year goes on. It\u2019s going to take on a life of its own. \u2026 To me, that is the beauty of it, is that I do not know and we do not know.\u201d Starting Tuesday, the story starts getting told. Wade and the Heat head about 45 minutes north to Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida for training camp \u2013 five straight days of workouts preceding Sunday\u2019s preseason opener at San Antonio. Decisions will have to be made quickly about playing time and roles, and part of that formula is figuring out how Wade best fits into coach Erik Spoelstra\u2019s plan. \u201cMost pro athletes, unfortunately, they don\u2019t get to know when the end is \u2013 or at least they\u2019re the last ones to know and it\u2019s certainly not on their terms,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe has this incredible blessing to know when that finish line will be and be able to have the perspective to make every day matter. It\u2019s the right player, the right organization, the right coaching staff, the right timing for all of this.\u201d Wade announced his decision on Sept. 16 that he was coming back for a final season, after at one time leaning about \u201c90 percent\u201d toward retirement over the summer. He agreed to a minimum contract worth $2.4 million, or roughly about $200,000 less than he made in his rookie season after the Heat took the Marquette guard with the No. 5 pick in the 2003 draft. His decision wasn\u2019t about money or role. It was about making sure the right ending to a career gets written. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s a Hall of Famer,\u201d Heat point guard Goran Dragic said. \u201cHe still can produce. He showed that last year. He can still take over a game at any time. And just to have him on the court is special. His ability, his aura, his presence on the floor, it influences everyone. It\u2019s contagious, know what I mean? His confidence spreads, his ability, it\u2019s a feeling that\u2019s so good for us.\u201d Wade returned to the Heat in a trade last February, after spending the 2016-17 season with Chicago and the start of last season with Cleveland. For his career, he\u2019s a 22.5-point scorer and the Heat all-time leader in points, assists, steals and games played. \u201cHe has more to give this game,\u201d Spoelstra said. Wade enters this season 113 points shy of Clyde Drexler for No. 30 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. The legacy was secured long ago. That\u2019s not why he\u2019s still on the court. Wade has turned much of his basketball attention already to his son Zaire, a rising high school junior who has Division I offers and will surely be getting more. Before he becomes a full-timer in the bleachers at his kid\u2019s games, there\u2019s the last dance. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to be very uncomfortable with this whole thing,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThe farewell tour is not something I wanted. I think people around me know I really, really, really didn\u2019t want this. So I just look at it as this is me just saying `goodbye\u2019 more than anything.\u201d"},{"id":38611,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-elton-brand-tasks-philadelphia-76ers-gm","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Elton Brand tasked with continuing Philadelphia 76ers' ascension","content":" Does Elton Brand check all the boxes? It is not a criticism of Brand to say this is not who most people expected would replace Bryan Colangelo as General Manager of one of the most intriguing franchises in the league. After Colangelo\u2019s ouster in June, the 76ers continued to talk big, both about the free agents they were going after and the people they expected to hire to lead their front office. There were conveniently leaked stories expressing the team\u2019s interest in R.C. Buford, and Daryl Morey, and many of the other big-time execs in the game. But after not getting any of them to commit, and interviewing several highly regarded external candidates during the summer on a \u201cpretty selective list,\u201d as owner Josh Harris told ESPN over the summer, the Sixers pivoted back toward their internal candidates. The curious news was while they had several good ones from which to choose, they chose the one with the least experience, both in Philly and as an executive. Brand was only named GM of the Sixers\u2019 G-League affiliate in Delaware in August 2017. Brand will report directly to Harris, as will coach Brett Brown, with Brand in charge of personnel and Brown, who\u2019d been the interim GM immediately after Colangelo\u2019s resignation, in charge of everything on the floor. In picking Brand, the Sixers passed over two very good, more experienced internal candidates in Ned Cohen and Marc Eversley \u2014 both of whom received promotions along with Brand. But Brand\u2019s the guy with all the juice now. Cohen spent a dozen years working for the league before coming to Philadelphia in 2016 as vice president of basketball operations and chief of staff. He quickly made a name for himself in Philly as one of the sharpest executives around. He was promoted along with Brand to a new title, assistant general manager, where he will oversee the team\u2019s roster and cap management. Eversley was hired by Colangelo from Washington in 2016, overseeing player personnel, and using his network of contacts as a former Nike executive to make Philly as attractive a destination for potential free agents as possible. If former player agents can be given GM authority, why on earth couldn\u2019t Eversley, who\u2019s well-regarded around the league? The Sixers came to believe that Brand has leadership skill and potential that their other executives didn\u2019t have, or didn\u2019t have enough of at a time when Philly is poised to again become a power in the east. They think Brand will be able to provide hands-on teaching and motivating some of their young players. They think he\u2019ll be able to collaborate with and occasionally push back on Brown and the coaching staff. And they think Brand\u2019s status as a former player will help them both with their team and with potential free agents. It\u2019s a formula that\u2019s worked in the league in recent years. But it\u2019s nonetheless a gamble. In Detroit, Joe Dumars was named President of Basketball Operations in 2000 by the Pistons\u2019 late former owner, Bill Davidson, just a year after his retirement as a player. Dumars quickly put together the core group \u2014 Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, Rip Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace \u2014 that won the 2004 NBA championship and made six straight Eastern Conference finals. In addition, Dumars was also able to corral top coaching talent, bringing in Rick Carlisle, Larry Brown and Flip Saunders in succession. Dumars saw something in Billups that few others did when he got him from Minnesota \u2014 a true lead guard. He believed Ben Wallace could anchor a championship defense and made the move in 2004 to bring Rasheed Wallace in as the final piece. Similarly, Danny Ainge hadn\u2019t run a team when Boston hired him from Turner Sports, where he was a colleague, in 2003 to be executive director of basketball operations. Ainge had coached in Phoenix for two-plus seasons, but had never run a team. He, too, constructed a championship team where a rebuilding one once stood, getting Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to pair alongside Paul Pierce in 2007, then rebuilding Boston back up to its current status by trading Pierce and Garnett to Brooklyn and watching the Lottery picks roll in. Ainge topped all that by taking a chance that Brad Stevens could make the transition from Butler to TD Garden. He was, on all of it, ahead of the curve and correct. But: Dumars and Ainge, while not doing total rebuilds, did not inherit teams with the potential of this Sixers squad. Philly may well be proven correct by elevating Brand. He may be the voice that can reach and hold Joel Embiid\u2019s attention, Colangelo clearly having ceded that authority with his superstar with the whole burner accounts insanity and everything contained therein. Brand could certainly have sway and influence as a just-finished player in the locker room with the likes of Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz. Brand is smart and was certainly part of numerous great teams as a player, from his AAU days with Metta World Peace and Lamar Odom, to the 1999 Duke team that made the NCAA national championship team, along with Shane Battier, Corey Maggette and Trajon Langdon, to the Clippers teams with Sam Cassell that broke through and made the playoffs for the first time in two decades. But Brand will have to be one of the team\u2019s biggest voices when it comes to free agency, and he will have to do better than the franchise did this summer, when it didn\u2019t get any of the big names it had said, rather vociferously, it was planning to bag. No LeBron; no Kawhi; no PG13. Brown led the pursuit as interim GM, but everyone involved said that titles didn\u2019t really matter; it was the idea of playing alongside Embiid and Simmons that would carry the day. The day went uncarried. The 76ers will again be a player next summer, having brought in vets (Wilson Chandler and Mike Muscala) entering the last year of their respective contracts, with J.J. Redick and Jerryd Bayless also up after this coming year. Embiid\u2019s max deal is the only significant one on the books next summer. Fultz looks like he\u2019s rehabbed his jumper . Cohen and Eversley and Brown will certainly know exactly who they want to pursue in 2019. For his sudden ascension to pass muster in the Illadelph, Elton Brand will have to be The Closer."},{"id":38614,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-mailbag-september-24-2018","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Morning Tip Mailbag: Your questions on Oklahoma City Thunder, breakout players and more","content":" Ok-lahoma, where the guard comes flying down the wing! From Sid Walker : I\u2019m sure Schroder will play a lot with Westbrook, Sid \u2014 and that\u2019s not a bad thing. If Russ is going to be shooting a ton anyway, I\u2019d much rather him be coming off pindowns and screens, rolling downhill where his strength and toughness reach their apex of difficulty to defend, rather than him pulling up with the ball or barreling into multiple defenders with teammates standing around. That won\u2019t require modifying much of his game \u2014 and, let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s not likely to happen at this point of his career. As for \u201clistening to the coach,\u201d my guess is Westbrook listens more than you think, but not as much as Billy Donovan would hope. Centers of attention. From Matthew Williams : They can \u201cco-exist,\u201d Matthew. But can they thrive? Kind of doubt it. Indy obviously was at its best offensively last season going smaller; per NBA.com\/Stats , among five-man units that played together 500 minutes or more last season, the Pacers\u2019 quintet of Darren Collison, Victor Oladipo, Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young and Turner was top 10 in Offensive Rating (109.8). And while Sabonis and Turner have each improved from the perimeter to the point where Nate McMillan could give them more minutes together, that\u2019s not the ideal pairing. Why clog the wings with one of them getting in the way or keeping a defender closer to Oladipo on drives when you can have Bogdanovic spotting up in the corner and keeping his man with him? I\u2019m figuring you\u2019ll continue to see more of Domas coming off the bench to anchor the second unit as you saw last season, with occasional pairings with Myles depending on matchups \u2014 but not huge doses. Coming Attractions. From Daniel O\u2019Leary : By \u201cbreakout,\u201d I\u2019m assuming you mean any three of all players, not just rookies, who has not yet been a consistent high-level performer and who aren\u2019t necessarily expected to do (e.g., Luka Doncic in Dallas)? If so, I can come up with three: 1) Brandon Ingram, Lakers. I doubt he\u2019ll spend a minute on the floor this season without either LeBron or Rajon Rondo out there with him, and that should mean multiple unencumbered looks at the front of the rim every night for the 21 year old, who had already improved as a driver\/finisher last season.. If he\u2019s been in the lab this summer he should improve across the board in shooting percentages, and build on the 1.8 3-point attempts he had last year. The Chris Bosh\/Kevin Love role playing off of James is there for Ingram for the taking (the Dwyane Wade\/Kyrie Irving role having not yet been filled, and will not be filled until the Summer of 2019).  2)  Wendell Carter, Jr., Bulls. Big fan of the Duke rookie, who should provide major impact in the middle in Chicago immediately. His ability to rebound alone will make him a productive player, but I think Carter has a lot more in his tool bag offensively than he was able to show playing alongside Marvin Bagley, et. al , last year in Durham. And he should have plenty of room to operate in the paint playing alongside Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine. There\u2019s a reason he has consistently been compared to Al Horford by NBA personnel types. 3) Josh Jackson, Suns. The rising second-year swing was much better the second half of his rookie season, and he could be poised for even more with the infusion of talent in Phoenix during the offseason. Not sure how the minutes will shake out for Jackson with Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson and rookie Mikal Bridges now on the roster. But Jackson\u2019s defensive chops will probably give him a chance to carve out some PT; he\u2019ll have to significantly improve from deep (.263 on threes last season) to stay out there with Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton and the others.

Signed to a four-year, $72 million deal in 2016 by former exec Phil Jackson, the 33-year-old former Defensive Player of the Year never panned out in Gotham, with a torn rotator cuff and a 20-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy among the lowlights. By stretching and waiving Noah now, rather than after the upcoming season, the Knicks can spread the last year of his contract ($19.295 million) over the next three years, meaning an annual $6.4 million hit on their cap through 2022 \u2014 and which will also help create the cap room necessary to be able to offer two max deals next summer. 9,640 \u2014 Square footage of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s San Antonio home, which the coach has reportedly put on the market  at a price of $4.5 million. Per the San Antonio News-Express , the home was one of several properties owned by Popovich and his late wife, Erin. 3 \u2014 Times veteran guard Jarrett Jack has played with the Pelicans\u2019 franchise. The 34 year old signed for a third tour last week with New Orleans, where he\u2019ll have a battle sticking on a roster that already has Jrue Holiday and Elfrid Payton, among others, at point guard going into the start of camp. 1) After a crazy, crazy summer, dreams begin in earnest around the Association this morning , with all but Philly and Dallas, which started early, getting going with Media Days. And while Golden State is still a prohibitive favorite to win a fourth title in the last five years going in, there are storylines galore throughout the league: LeBron in L.A., Kawhi in Toronto, DeMar in San Antonio, \u2018Melo in Houston, the Celtics-Sixers rivalry in the East, and on and on. 2) I think I understand the new clear path rule, though I may mess up once or twice at the start of the season. I definitely understand the 14-second shot clock reset rules, and am all for them , especially with how they could change end of game strategies by coaches. In the final 30 seconds of play, it used to be if you were down a bucket, and the opposing team got an offensive rebound off a missed shot, you had to foul, because you wouldn\u2019t have enough time even if you stopped them again by the time you got the ball to get off a quality shot. Now, with the clock reset to 14 instead of all the way back to 24, you might. 3) Golf is better when Tiger Woods is winning. Just look at the near-chaos at the Tour Championship on Sunday, when Woods strode to the 72nd green, his 80th career victory and first in more than five years all but assured. That was Beatles\/Michael Jackson level of fan frenzy. And it was missed. Tiger Woods may not be the best person or role model. But he\u2019s a great, great golfer, and I\u2019m a fan, and it\u2019s thrilling to see him finally healthy and playing the way he\u2019s capable. Don\u2019t @ me. 4) You\u2019ve been pasteurized! 1) Mark Cuban should have been suspended from ownership duties by the NBA for his role \u2014 or, as it seems now, lack of one \u2014 in addressing the horrific culture for women in his Mavericks workplace during the last two decades. The independent investigation led by former prosecutors Anne Milgram and Evan Krutoy corroborated many of the claims made by former female employees on the business side of the Mavericks\u2019 organization detailed in a Sports Illustrated story written by Jessica Luther and Jon Wertheim last February. (The full report by Milgram and Krutoy can be read here .) The report, bolstered by more than 200 interviews with past and present staffers, backs Cuban\u2019s claim that he did not know about most of the horrific behaviors of his former longtime team president, Terdema Ussery, or two other former employees, one of whom committed two domestic violence incidents while on staff \u2014 including against a fellow Mavs employee with whom he was involved in a relationship at the time. But almost nowhere is ignorance acceptable as excuse legally: Officer, I was not aware that the speed limit was 35; therefore, please tear up that speeding ticket.  Particularly, it doesn\u2019t fly with Cuban. No owner has been as hands-on with his team as Cuban since buying the team in 2000. The fact that he primarily obsessed with the basketball operations side doesn\u2019t give him cover for not being up to speed on the awful things that were permitted and covered up for on the business side. A huge chunk of the Cuban Brand is that he\u2019s way smarter about business, and business practices, than you are. (And, he is.) A self-made billionaire does not let many details slide on his or her watch, at his or her company. The idea, as Cuban claims, that he didn\u2019t know Ussery had already been accused of workplace misconduct before Cuban finalized the purchase of the team from Ross Perot, Jr., is laughable \u2014 it was reported, extensively, as early as 1998, two years before Cuban got the team \u2014 by the Dallas Morning News. ( The author of at least one of the stories , Marc Stein, has continued in some capacity in sports journalism, so I\u2019m told.) It does not bring me any joy to say this. I like Mark Cuban, very, very much. He did great things \u2014 on the basketball side \u2014 with his team. He is as smart as he believes. He is a respected voice now in ownership circles. His public spats with the NBA with regard to its officiating crews and procedures have led to real and significant improvements in each. Many of his team\u2019s innovations with regard to in-game arena entertainment have become Best Practices around the league. But ignorance remains no excuse, and especially when it comes to not knowing about how horribly his female business employees were treated, how they were denied earned promotions, how they were \u2014 as many female employees in other businesses are \u2014 retaliated against if they complained about being sexually harassed by their supervisors and\/or bosses.  If Mark Cuban were shown a company that allowed this kind of treatment of its female employees, he would excoriate the boss of that company. The $10 million he will donate to organizations that fight domestic violence and promote women in businesses is fine (and, obviously, was a non-fine fine issued by the league). But the league needed to make an even stronger statement that, no matter the reason, an owner so unaware of what was going on with his team would be held accountable. I heard Adam Silver\u2019s press conference Friday afternoon, in which he said that he was leery of setting a precedent in which an owner is punished for what someone else in his organization did. And that is a fair position. But the women who\u2019ve been harmed while working for Mark Cuban\u2019s Mavericks \u2014 and the dozens of women who likely were scared away by what they\u2019d heard and been told in confidence over the years \u2014 deserved some kind of restitution. I don\u2019t know the right number \u2014 six months? But they deserved some signal from the NBA that it would go above and beyond to send a message that this was no longer going to be tolerated by this league. 2) Condolences and love to Richard Jefferson and his family after the shooting death of his father, Richard, Sr., last week. 3) Coaches get arthritis. GMs get arthritis. Owners get arthritis. Writers and reporters get arthritis. Not active players .  \u2014 Spurs guard \u2014 it is still hard to type \u201cSpurs guard,\u201d even in this context \u2014 DeMar DeRozan ,  clearly referencing his desire that his alma mater USC Trojans avenge their two losses last season to arch-rival UCLA this year, amirite? \u201cWilmington truly is my home. Kept thinking about all those places I grew up going to. And the deaths \u2014 it was so sad about the babies (killed during the hurricane). You don\u2019t want to see any of that anywhere, but when it\u2019s home, that\u2019s tough to swallow.\u201d \u2014 Michael Jordan , to the Charlotte Observer , after pledging $2 million to relief\/recovery efforts in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence tore through the Carolinas earlier this month. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, playing off the ball maybe isn\u2019t one of my strong points. Some guys are really good at it in this league, but with the ball in my hands, I\u2019m a little bit better.\u201d \u2014 Grizzlies forward Kyle Anderson , to local reporters , at his introductory press conference last week in Memphis. Anderson, who turned 25 last week, was one of four new Grizzlies introduced last week; he also joined most of his new teammates in a pre-training camp minicamp last month in Los Angeles . \u201cThe black Dirk is finally here, guys.\u201d \u2014 DeAndre Jordan , at Mavericks\u2019 Media Day on Friday, announcing his presence with authority, three years after he jilted Dallas at the altar at the 11th hour to return to the Clippers as a free agent."},{"id":38587,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-nba-central-division-preview","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Central Division preview","content":"John Schuhmann and I analyze the Central Division and preview the 2018-19 season for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks, Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls. * * * Subscribe to the Hang Time podcast on Apple Podcasts or iHeart Radio for a new episode every Monday and Thursday this season!"},{"id":38612,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/30-teams-30-days-portland-trail-blazers","date":"2018-09-24","title":"30 Teams in 30 Days: Portland Trail Blazers look to bounce back after playoff disappointment","content":" What offseason?  That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team: Portland Trail Blazers 2017-18 Record:  49-33, lost in f irst round to New Orleans Pelicans Who\u2019s new: Seth Curry (free agency), Nik Stauskas (free agency), Anfernee Simons (Draft), Gary Trent Jr. (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  Ed Davis, Pat Connaughton, Shabazz Napier The lowdown: Juiced once again by an elite backcourt, the Blazers took the Northwest Division title and nearly won 50 games, teasing the NBA world about their potential to rattle the cage in the postseason. Alas, it was all a fantasy, as the Blazers were quickly swept in the first round by the Pelicans. Damian Lillard delivered his best regular season and earned an All-NBA first team appointment, yet he shot 35 percent against the Pelicans and symbolized the Blazers\u2019 crash. Center Jusuf Nurkic couldn\u2019t recreate the same impact he had when he arrived in 2017 and the imbalance continued between\u2019s Portland\u2019s backcourt and the front line. Overall, 2017-18 was a bittersweet experience for the Blazers, who were left to wonder how far they could go with Lillard and CJ McCollum hauling the load. The Blazers don\u2019t want another rehash of what happened in the summer of 2016, when they were flush with money but made offseason roster missteps. Portland gave generous deals to such role players like Evan Turner, Maurice Harkless and Meyers Leonard that summer, essentially committing to that roster. With Lillard and McCollum rightly commanding big salaries, Portland was in a salary-cap pickle, largely prohibited from doing much else in subsequent offseasons. Two years later, none of highly-paid supporting cast have made a big difference. The Blazers enter the 2018-19 season with virtually the same rotation and, therefore, little chance to worry the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets out West. Portland could only extend Nurkic, sign a couple of marginal guards in free agency and use its first-round pick on a baby-faced teenager who skipped college. Meanwhile, the LeBron James-led Lakers, the Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets all figure to improve and challenge for Portland\u2019s spot in the West. Portland refused to go the extra mile to keep Davis, a beloved and well-respected hard-working big man who signed with the Brooklyn Nets. His tenacity might be missed because Portland did nothing to replace it this summer. The Blazers did, however, give a reported four years and $48 million to Nurkic as both sides had little choice but strike a deal. A soft free-agent market \u2013 especially for centers \u2013 cut into into Nurkic\u2019s leverage as a restricted free agent. Nurkic, 24, is easily No. 3 on the Blazers\u2019 talent checklist and they would\u2019ve been worse off without him this season. He\u2019s a seven-footer who\u2019s active on the glass, brings a decent touch and would even be more effective in the pick and roll if the Blazers utilized it more. He\u2019s not outstanding in any one area, however, and his role remains secondary on a team with McCollum and Lillard. The most intriguing summer decision was to draft Simons, a true preps-to-pro who is well-rounded basketball-wise and much more mature, behavior-wise, than his age or face will show. He turned down the chance to play at Louisville after the school was rocked by scandal and basically went through basketball drills and life tutorials at IMG. That said, it\u2019s tough to imagine Simons going from virtually no competition to key rotation player for a 49-win NBA team in a year. Most likely, he\u2019ll be the pet project of the Blazers\u2019 player-development program and maybe show good strides come springtime. In Curry and Stauskas, the Blazers picked up some 3-point shooters who have had their share of trials. Curry has had misfortune so far in his four years in the NBA \u2014 beyond trying to exist the shadow of his brother, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry. He played well for the Sacramento Kings in 2015-16 and then, after finding a home with the Dallas Mavericks last season, suffered a stress fracture in his right tibia and missed most of last season . Though not a pure point guard, Curry does bring a good shooting stroke (43.2 percent on 3-pointers in his career). If healthy, he might be great addition to Portland\u2019s rotation. Stauskas was a bust in Sacramento as a former No. 8 pick in the 2014 draft and the Kings had to sacrifice a future first-rounder just to find a taker for him. He fizzled in Philly and Brooklyn as well, raising doubts about his career ( 34.9 career 3-point percentage ). This could represent his last chance in the NBA. When asked this summer about the state of the Blazers, Lillard was mostly positive in his response. We\u2019ll see if that changes by next spring.

Towns, 22, has played three seasons with Minnesota averaging 21.6 points, 11.7 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.4 blocks per game while posting career shooting percentages of 54.3% from the field, 38.7% from the three-point line and 83.6% from the charity stripe. The 7-0 center has increased his shooting percentages in each category in each of his first three seasons in the NBA, including hitting on a career-best 42.1% from downtown last season, which ranked him 14th in the NBA. Selected No. 1 overall in the 2015 NBA Draft by the Wolves, Towns is the first player in NBA history to accumulate 5,000+ points, 2,500+ rebounds and 250+ 3-pointers over his first three seasons in the NBA. In his third NBA season, Towns finished the 2017-18 campaign ranked fourth in the NBA in rebounding (12.3 rpg), 20th in scoring (21.3 ppg) and 11th in blocks (1.40 bpg) en route to earning All-NBA Third Team and NBA All-Star honors for the first time in his career. Towns also set career marks in field goal accuracy (54.5% \u2014 second-highest percentage in franchise history), free-throw percentage (85.8%) and three-point percentage. He set the franchise record for single-game scoring when he tallied 56 points against Atlanta on Mar. 28, becoming the fourth Wolves player to record 50+ points in a game. Towns also led the league in double-doubles in 2017-18 with 68 (182 career). He was named Western Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 20 (third career honor), after posting averages of 20.3 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists. The Edison, New Jersey, native was named the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 18.3 points, 10.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.68 blocks in 32.0 minutes per game his rookie season.  Towns ranked eighth in the NBA in rebounding, eighth in field goal accuracy, 10th in blocks, 26th in scoring and third in double-doubles (52). He was chosen as the Western Conference Player of the Week for Apr. 4-10 (the first Wolves rookie to be so honored) and swept all six Western Conference Rookie of the Month awards.

It\u2019s very different now. When the Heat hold their first practice of the season Tuesday, Dragic expects to be as rested and ready as he\u2019s been for any training camp in years. The point guard who went to his first All-Star Game last season wore down as the year went along, in part because of the grind he put himself through last summer while leading his native Slovenia to the European championship. This summer, he played less \u2014 and is hoping that pays off this season. \u201cI feel amazing. I feel great,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cI think one of the smartest moves I made was retiring from the national team, because I feel energized and pumped for this season. I always kind of hit a wall toward the end of a season, but I feel like this season is going to be a totally different story.\u201d At 32, Dragic is Miami\u2019s third-oldest player \u2014 among those in the Heat locker room, only Udonis Haslem (38) and the entering-his-final-season Dwyane Wade (36) have seen more birthdays. But Dragic is still a starter, still a very intregal part of everything Miami envisions for this season, and is coming off a year where he averaged 17.3 points. \u201cThe band is still together,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that I\u2019ll be part of this last dance with Dwyane.\u201d The biggest malady Dragic was dealing with at the end of last season was tendinitis in his right knee, something that bothered him for several weeks. He still led Miami in scoring during its five-game playoff appearance against Philadelphia, averaging 18.6 points. He wasn\u2019t the only Heat starter ailing when last season ended. Josh Richardson was playing through a bad shoulder, Hassan Whiteside had knee problems, James Johnson had a sports hernia and Tyler Johnson\u2019s thumb needed surgery. The Heat \u2013 who are one of the many teams that have been talking to Minnesota about a trade for Jimmy Butler \u2013 are hoping some health luck comes their way this season. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be good,\u201d Dragic said. If nothing else, he\u2019s not coming into this season as harried as he was last fall. Dragic has been back in Miami for about a month, after spending most of his offseason in Slovenia. A year ago, the European championships meant Dragic was still playing right up until the start of Heat camp. It wasn\u2019t a popular decision in Slovenia for Dragic to stop playing for the national team, which didn\u2019t qualify for the 2019 FIBA World Cup of Basketball in China and now faces an uphill climb if it\u2019s going to reach the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \u201cBut it was the right decision for me,\u201d Dragic said. The Heat sat out this past June\u2019s NBA Draft in part because of the deal they made in 2015 to bring Dragic to Miami. The package sent to Phoenix included two first-round selections, the first of which was used this year at the No. 16 overall spot. The other will be used in 2021. The price was steep, and the Heat aren\u2019t complaining. \u201cI\u2019d much rather have Goran Dragic than those two picks,\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said. Dragic is hoping to give Riley even more bang for his buck this season. The All-Star nod \u2014 even though it came as an injury replacement \u2013 was particularly meaningful for Dragic, and he felt that last season was one of his better seasons anyway. His goal for this season is simple: Be even better. \u201cI want to be at a high level for as long as possible,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cIf you come into a season without goals, you\u2019re just going through practice and it doesn\u2019t mean anything to you. But if you set goals, you\u2019re pushing yourself. And for me personally, my goal is to have a better season than I did last year. I don\u2019t want to drop a little bit at the end this season. I want to be energized, fresher, more consistent the whole way this time.\u201d"},{"id":38572,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-signs-klutch-sports-rich-paul-agent","date":"2018-09-23","title":"Anthony Davis signs with Klutch Sports Group","content":" New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis has officially signed with agent Rich Paul of the Klutch Sports Group.

Now, however, the former Chicago Bull could very well have played his 64th and last game in a Timberwolves uniform just one year after Minnesota dealt Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen to acquire him. Butler reportedly asked the franchise to trade him last week. With the Timberwolves\u2019 front office now on the same page, fulfilling that request and moving on from Butler appears to be a high priority for Minnesota.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team:  Oklahoma City Thunder 2017-18 Record:  48-34, lost in first round to Utah Jazz Who\u2019s new:  Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot (trade), Abdel Nader (trade), Nerlens Noel (free agency), Dennis Schr\u00f6der (trade), Hamidou Diallo (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  Carmelo Anthony, Nick Collison The lowdown:  Desperate to take advantage of the prime years of reigning Kia MVP Russell Westbrook, OKC traded for Anthony and Paul George before 2017-18 got started . The experiment was fraught with flaws and by midseason, the Thunder were 22-20 and visions of being a championship contender were snuffed. Westbrook responded with his second straight triple-double season , but skeptical media critics didn\u2019t even vote him first-team All-NBA. Anthony struggled with his role all season and while George was reasonably solid stats-wise, he crashed in the playoffs. Overall, it was a disappointing season. The biggest upset of the offseason happened on the first day of \u201917-18, when OKC sold itself as a better option for George than the Los Angeles Lakers. Pundits had George, an unrestricted free agent over the summer, headed to Los Angeles even before he played a game for OKC. What could be better than spending your career back home in the sunshine, playing next to LeBron James and \u2014 snickered the critics \u2014 escaping the suffocating shadow of Westbrook? Yet George didn\u2019t even take visits during free agency and the bond he and Westbrook forged was tighter than outsiders imagined. He cited it in choosing to re-sign with OKC. That, and a reported $137 million over four years did the trick. This was clearly a victory for a franchise that lost Kevin Durant in 2015 and rolled the dice on George without any assurances that he\u2019d stay put. It was also a victory for Westbrook, who was so thrilled at the news that he threw a \u201csigning party\u201d for George in OKC. Westbrook has endured whispers of being a bad and\/or selfish teammate, part of the fallout over Durant bolting for Golden State. The perception isn\u2019t justified as Westbrook is well-liked in the locker room and worked to develop a solid relationship with George and Anthony. (However, Westbrook must recover from the arthroscopic knee surgery he had in mid-September .) While the re-signing of George was celebrated, OKC wasn\u2019t exactly heartbroken to trade Anthony. The 34-year-old struggled to transition into being a supplemental player for the first time in his basketball life. The final straw, from a public view anyway, was his benching in the playoffs and his response: lashing out at assistant coach Maurice Cheeks and essentially checking out mentally in the Utah series. OKC traded Anthony to the Hawks in a three-team deal that forced OKC to toss in a 2022 lottery-protected first rounder to escape the buyout. Anthony then signed with the Rockets where he\u2019s the third option once again. With Westbrook, George and Steven Adams soaking up much of the payroll, OKC was limited this offseason. They took Diallo, a springy guard from Kentucky, in the second round. At least there will be a welcome return from defensive ace Andre Roberson, who is expected back from knee surgery. And Schroder, Noel and Luwawu-Cabarrot should figure into the rotation as well. Schroder, the Hawks\u2019 former starting point guard, is the most interesting of the bunch. He gets to the rim about as well as Westbrook and boasts a quick first step and crafty dribble. His shooting, however, is streaky, his defense is suspect and he doesn\u2019t always spot the open man. A bit less intriguing is the energetic Noel. Two years ago, he had a lucrative contract extension on the table from the Mavericks \u2026 which Noel refused, electing to take his $4 million qualifying offer to become an unrestricted free agent this summer. But the free-agent market, combined with Noel\u2019s thumb surgery last season , added injury to insult.  After getting a chilly reception around the league this summer, he finally took a two-year deal (with a player option) from OKC. The slender-framed Noel, who is neither an inside force nor a natural shooter, has struggled to find a comfort zone in today\u2019s NBA. Still, he\u2019s just 24 years old and can still develop some aspects of his game. Luwawu-Cabarrot is a good prospect for OKC\u2019s player-development program, bringing size (6-foot-6) and energy. He might force his way into the back end of the rotation at some point this season. Still, the best move of the summer for OKC was getting George\u2019s signature on a contract. Hard to imagine a bigger upset this season than that.

At one point last year, there did seem to be a path to The Finals for the Sixers, who looked like the East\u2019s best team in the first round of the playoffs. As Philly dispatched the Miami Heat in five games, the other top seeds in the East struggled to advance. But the Boston Celtics put an end to the Sixers\u2019 remarkable 20-1 stretch (going back to a 16-game winning streak to close the regular season) and are now adding Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward to the team that eliminated Philly in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Toronto Raptors, meanwhile have replaced DeMar DeRozan with Kawhi Leonard on the only team (East or West) that ranked in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency last season. Of course, the Sixers should be getting a much-improved Markelle Fultz, while seeing progress from both Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Embiid has the potential to be the biggest two-way force in the league and a matchup problem for every team in the Sixers\u2019 path. It\u2019s not unreasonable to imagine the Sixers in The Finals, just three years after a 10-72 season. It would be quite a story for the franchise and for the coach that wasn\u2019t afraid to make it the goal on the first day of training camp."},{"id":38591,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-york-knicks-joakim-noah-near-agreement-waive-report","date":"2018-09-23","title":"Report: New York Knicks close to parting ways with Joakim Noah","content":" Veteran center Joakim Noah is reportedly close to a contract buyout agreement with the New York Knicks, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic.

With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team:  Utah Jazz 2017-18 Record:  48-34, lost in Western Conference semifinals to Houston Rockets Who\u2019s new:  Grayson Allen (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  Jonas Jerebko, David Stockton The lowdown: Left woozy by the summer departure of free agent and franchise star Gordon Hayward , the Jazz gave the ball to a rookie and pulled a surprise by nearly winning 50 games and bouncing Oklahoma City Thunder from the playoffs . Their season was made more remarkable considering center Rudy Gobert played only 56 games because of knee issues. But Donovan Mitchell ( 20.5 points per game ) was an unexpected savior and far better than anyone imagined. He won over his teammates and coach Quin Snyder quickly, then earned respect around the league for taking charge and also bailing out Utah in a number of close games, both rare for a rookie. Mitchell finished as the Kia Rookie of the Year runner-up. Snyder made good use of the rotation and found functional roles for most and the Jazz used Mitchell and defense to flourish. By the playoffs, Mitchell was arguably the best player on a floor that featured former Kia MVP Russell Westbrook and Paul George, and the Jazz entered the offseason feeling confident about the future. In 2016, the young Portland Trail Blazers made the playoffs, stunning the LA Clippers in the first round before giving the Golden State Warriors a feisty series in the semis. Encouraged by the bounce and swagger showed by an emerging club, the Blazers handed out contract extensions and \u2026 they haven\u2019t done anything special since. In hindsight, every one of those extensions looks like a mistake. The lesson: Fool\u2019s gold can sometimes, um, fool you. Are the Jazz headed down that path? The situations aren\u2019t exactly the same, yet similar to a degree. Instead of going outside to make a few cosmetic changes to the rotation, Utah was mostly content to keep free agents Dante Exum and Derrick Favors, giving each contracts that were somewhat generous in a soft market that worked against most players. Exum signed for three years and a reported $33 million , or roughly the going rate for a backup point guard. But Exum\u2019s run in Utah has been interrupted by injury and, even when healthy, his play was inconsistent. He perhaps earned the benefit of the doubt in the playoffs when he stepped in for an injured Ricky Rubio and had moments of solid play. Evidently, the Jazz feel Exum\u2019s better days are just ahead. He\u2019s only 23 and after investing so much time in him, Utah wasn\u2019t ready to cut him loose. He brings great size (6-foot-6), is energetic, and point guard isn\u2019t a Jazz strength. If nothing else, Exum gives Utah a sense of security. Favors is richer after signing a reported two-year, $36 million extension as no other team was willing to beat that price for him. The last two seasons weren\u2019t exactly robust for Favors, who battled through injuries, sporadic play and found himself benched because of mismatches in today\u2019s stretch-happy NBA. Favors has worked to develop more of a 3-point shot , but his lack of perimeter shooting was exploited by Houston in the playoffs. But as the case with Exum, the Jazz have years of player-development invested in Favors. As Utah\u2019s longest-tenured player, Favors is a solid defender next to Gobert and the Jazz outscored their opponents by 7.2 points per 100 possessions with the two bigs on the floor together . And even though he\u2019s seemingly been around Utah forever, Favors is just 27 years old. The decisions by the Jazz to maintain the status quo isn\u2019t unusual with this franchise, which has long prided itself on stability and player development. Strangely enough, Mitchell claims to love life in the Wasatch Mountains \u2014 something to remember when and if he ever reaches free agency (unlikely, since the Jazz will surely break the bank for him). Jazz GM Dennis Lindsey moved up to take Mitchell in the 2017 Draft and has a knack for finding talent in places where few others search. He has had a solid track record in the Draft and with the 21st pick took Allen. A year ago, the Duke shooter considered entering the draft, but got mild feedback from NBA types. Allen brings 3-point range to a team that ranked 13th in 3-pointers made and attempted last season . Unless he makes an impact right away, Allen will be in the back end of a rotation that showcases Joe Ingles for distance shooting. The trick for Utah is to match or surpass last season\u2019s effort while catching no one by surprise this time. And the Jazz must do that with virtually the same cast as before.

While Boston is talented overall, individual familiarity with the Warriors is also seen as an advantage to Irving. \u201cBut there\u2019s one factor that they\u2019re aware of, and I\u2019m aware of, and that\u2019s that I\u2019ve seen them up close,\u201d he told ESPN. \u201cI\u2019ve played them so many times. We\u2019ve gone in a seven-game series [when he was in Cleveland], so I know what it takes. \u201cNow, how do I communicate to our guys that this is the top-tier team, and we have to grow immensely in the next six months to beat them consistently? Not just one game, not just two, but in a seven-game series, because they\u2019re so dang great.

A few rule changes all but rubber-stamped after prior consideration, some reports on the international game and on revenue sharing, an update on sports betting, and other business-as-usual items. But coming as it did in the immediate wake of the league\u2019s mandates on the Dallas Mavericks and owner Mark Cuban after an independent investigation into that team\u2019s workplace culture, there were a lot of governors from the other 29 teams paying close and serious attention. \u201cIn that room, it was a sobering moment for everyone there,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in discussing the findings from allegations that surfaced in a Sports Illustrated article last February. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of introspection now \u2026 saying, can something like this happen in my workplace? Whether it\u2019s the NBA or any other businesses they operate, what are the best practices preventing those things going forward? I can only say, we will redouble our efforts at the league and working with our teams to try to ensure that the kind of events that happened at the Mavericks never happen again.\u201d Silver, speaking with reporters after the conclusion of the Board\u2019s two-day fall sessions, cited the Mavericks\u2019 transparency in cooperating with the investigation into the oppressive work environment that persisted for years under former CEO Terdema Ussery. He also talked of the limited precedents in assessing penalties in such a case, particularly on Cuban or the Dallas basketball operation. The incidents described or corroborated by 215 witnesses were limited to the franchise\u2019s business operation, according to the investigation, and Cuban was found not to have committed or even to have known about them. None of the 215 people interviewed informed him directly. Silver factored that into decision, one that has drawn criticism from some media outlets as being too lenient. As part of the resolution, Cuban agreed to donate $10 million to women\u2019s organizations, including those focused on women in the sports industry and on domestic abuse. Had Silver simply imposed a fine on the Mavericks owner, the league\u2019s by-laws limit the amount to $2.5 million. \u201cI don\u2019t know what dollar amount could possibly compensate employees over a long period of time for that type of misconduct,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhile I couldn\u2019t compel him to pay [the $10 million donation], I went to him and thought, under the circumstances, that would be an appropriate number.\u201d The Mavericks also have been compelled to institute several reforms in their workplace, including promoting or hiring women into senior management positions, establishing protocols for reporting misconduct and educating employees on proper conduct. But what had Silver encouraged Friday was the sense that changes imposed on the Dallas franchise might serve as a model for what the league\u2019s other teams might willingly adopt. A portion of the investigative report featured 13 recommendations specifically for the Mavericks. \u201cBut we at the league office thought it was so well done,\u201d Silver said, \u201cit clearly put in one place a set of rules that we think all workplaces should follow.\u201d And the No. 1 recommendation? \u201cYou need women in the workplace,\u201d he said. Mercifully, Silver didn\u2019t go into detail on the changes in adjudicating clear-path fouls, one of the league\u2019s most vexing rules to call and, worse, review. It was the protracted video reviews by game officials of the labyrinthian rule and its extenuating circumstances that the change adopted Friday is intended to reduce, in both frequency and length.  \u201cThe changes to the clear path foul rule establish \u2018bright line\u2019 standards based on the position of players at the time of the foul,\u201d the NBA\u2019s official release explained, \u201cwhile also narrowing required referee judgment and reducing the number of variables impacting the rule\u2019s application.\u201d If you want chapter and verse, you can read more about clear-path definitions here . The shot-clock reset change is far simpler. Rather than resetting to a full 24 seconds after an offensive rebound of a missed field goal or free throw that hit the rim, it will go to 14 seconds. Two other scenarios in which the clock will reset to 14 seconds: after a loose-ball foul called on the defensive team immediately after a missed shot or free throw, or when the offensive team takes possession of the ball after it immediately goes out of bounds following a missed shot or free throw. The 14-second reset has been in effect in the NBA\u2019s G League the past two seasons, in the WNBA since 2016 and in FIBA play since 2014-15. It was used on an experimental basis in the summer leagues this year. Finally, for purposes of triggering replays, the league\u2019s definition of \u201chostile act\u201d was expanded. Now, beyond looking at player vs. player interaction, the referees can review encounters involving players with coaches, coaches with coaches, and either with referees or fans. The NBA long has been committed to freedom of movement by players between contracts. But over the past year or so, franchise stars such as Paul George in Indiana, Kawhi Leonard in San Antonio and most recently Jimmy Butler in Minnesota have pushed to move during contracts. That leads to turmoil in markets that feel they\u2019re being abandoned, and challenges to teams trying to enforce a contract for a player to stay or generate trade value when rivals know the star wants out. Butler, for example, reportedly wants to be dealt to the L.A. Clippers, the Knicks or the Nets rather than play his final season with the Timberwolves before hitting free agency next summer. Silver was asked how the owners feel about such scenarios and if the league might have any involvement. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to find the right balance in terms of right contract length, advantages of incumbent teams to keep [players] in those markets and keeping players focused on playing under their contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any scenario where these situations will go away completely.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never been a secret that \u2014 in this sport in particular \u2014 players have enormous leverage. But teams have leverage, too,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should be in everyone\u2019s interest, frankly, teams and players, for players to honor contracts. Because in a team sport an individual player\u2019s desire to leave that market has a huge impact on his teammates as well, many of whom have come to that market out of a desire to play with that player.\u201d The Timberwolves traded three promising young players \u2014 Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen \u2014 to Chicago in June 2017 for Butler, counting on his All-Star skills and experience to spark a return to the playoffs. That\u2019s exactly what happened, but reports of Butler chafing with young stars Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, and his alleged unhappiness over the Wolves\u2019 handling of a contract extension, have led to serious drama in the Twin Cities. At this point, team owner Glen Taylor reportedly might step in to consider trade offers for Butler, intervening due to the tight relationship between the player and Wolves coach\/president of basketball operations Tom Thibodeau. Regarding additional ways to aid a star\u2019s current team \u2014 such as enabling that club to offer the fatter, five-year extension sooner, rather than waiting till his free agency \u2014 Silver noted the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement between the owners and players would need to be revised. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are any easy fixes here,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cThis is a relationship business and that\u2019s something that\u2019s never going to change. Despite advances in analytics, scouting, technology, it\u2019s still a people business.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Butler requested a trade earlier this week, with his preferred destinations reportedly the LA Clippers, New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. His list is in that order, per ESPN. Nonetheless, the four-time All Star wants out of Minnesota. Wojnarowski reports Butler clashed with teammates Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins and has all intentions to leave in free agency in 2019 if not traded.

Beginning with the 2018 NBA preseason, the shot clock will reset to 14 seconds in offensive rebounding situations, as opposed to 24; the clear path foul rule will be simplified; and the definition of a \u201chostile act\u201d will be expanded for purposes of triggering instant replay review. Details on each rule modification appear below:  The rule has been in effect in the NBA G League since the 2016-17 season, in the WNBA since 2016 and in FIBA play since 2014-15. The rule was also in place during 2018 NBA Summer Leagues. A clear path foul is now defined as a personal foul against any offensive player during his team\u2019s transition scoring opportunity in the following circumstances: the ball is ahead of the tip of the circle in the backcourt; no defender is ahead of the offensive player with the transition scoring opportunity; the player with the transition scoring opportunity is in control of the ball (or a pass has been thrown to him); and if the foul deprives his team of an opportunity to score. As part of the clear path foul rule simplification, referees will no longer need to make judgment calls as to whether or not a defender was between (or had the opportunity to be between) the offensive player with the transition scoring opportunity and the basket. In addition, referees will no longer have to determine whether or not the defender was at any time ahead of the offensive player prior to committing the foul, nor will it be relevant whether or not a defender beat the offensive player with the transition scoring opportunity into the frontcourt. Further, plays of this nature will no longer have to originate in the backcourt (since transition scoring opportunities can originate in the frontcourt). Under the simplified rule, a clear path foul cannot occur if the fouled player is in the act of shooting or if the foul is caused by the defender\u2019s attempt to intercept or deflect a pass intended for the player attempting to score in transition. If a clear path foul is committed, the offended team will continue to be awarded two free throws and possession of the ball on the sideline nearest the spot where the foul occurred.

The league stopped short of flatly ordering the 29 other clubs to institute new policies, though Silver\u2019s wishes were very clear. \u201cUse this opportunity to make changes and create a dialogue within your organizations about workplace policies, procedures and respectful conduct,\u201d Silver wrote.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: New Orleans Pelicans 2017-18 Record:  48-34, lost in Western Conference semifinals to Golden State Warriors Who\u2019s new:  Jahlil Okafor (free agency), Julius Randle (free agency), Elfrid Payton (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  DeMarcus Cousins, Rajon Rondo The lowdown:  For the first time in the Anthony Davis era, the Pelicans won a playoff series, and did so in style, sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers without Cousins. The starting center was lost for the season months earlier with an Achilles injury, forcing the Pelicans to change their style on the fly. This was done because Nikola Mirotic, obtained from the Chicago Bulls before the trade deadline, instantly became a valuable stretch shooter. And Rondo paired comfortably with Jrue Holiday in the backcourt and smartly directed the club, coming up big in the postseason. And of course, Davis generated Kia MVP chatter with a first team All-NBA season , dominating on both ends with 28.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game . Although the Pelicans were swamped in the Western Conference semifinals by the defending-champion Golden State Warriors , this was a triumphant season that awakened the franchise and saved coach Alvin Gentry\u2019s job. After spending lavishly, and maybe recklessly, in the past in giving fat contracts to marginal-at-best players (Omer Asik, Alexis Ajinca, Solomon Hill, E\u2019Twaun Moore) and then breaking the bank for Holiday, the Pelicans needed to be more fiscally responsible. This was the task for embattled GM Dell Demps, and he found some distressed assets in Okafor and Payton along with a relative bargain in Randle to ease the sting of some key losses. Demps had to make a financial decision on Cousins and chose not to put his job and the Pelicans\u2019 franchise in jeopardy by offering Cousins a long-term deal. That wasn\u2019t exactly a tough call; Cousins is a big man coming off an injury that requires a calendar year to heal. Which means the Pelicans would essentially pay Cousins to rehab the regular season, then hope he\u2019d resume being one of the NBA\u2019s top centers in 2019-20. The Achilles injury is a career-ender or crippler in most cases and, basically, this was a money gamble the Pelicans couldn\u2019t afford to make. This isn\u2019t a franchise that\u2019s equipped to laugh at the luxury tax even if Cousins recovered nicely. So the Pelicans gave him an offer he could refuse, and he did, fleeing to Golden State instead , where the talent-rich Warriors don\u2019t need him for the regular season. The Pelicans played well without Cousins last season and into the playoffs, where their breezy, open-court style caught the Blazers off guard. So maybe the loss of Cousins will be minimal at worst. Rondo\u2019s departure via free agency to the Lakers on a one-year deal was a deal New Orleans easily could\u2019ve matched or beat. His decision to leave was puzzling \u2014 after resurrecting his career in New Orleans and once again becoming one of the game\u2019s great floor leaders, why would he leave happiness? At least by going to the Lakers, Rondo helped the Pelicans get Randle . The Lakers had to renounce the restricted free agent to sign Rondo (and others), and so the Pelicans found landed a 23-year-old, 6-foot-9 brute at power forward who\u2019s just tapping his potential. As a bonus, Randle came on a steal of a deal (just the mid-level) because of the soft free agent market. He averaged 16.1 ppg and 8 rpg last season and grew more confident after the All-Star break. There\u2019s the issue of where Randle fits next to Davis and which one will see time at center, (Randle can\u2019t space the floor like Cousins did), but that\u2019s a pleasant \u201cproblem.\u201d They also found Rondo\u2019s replacement with another restricted free agent whose team refused to match his offer. Payton, the No. 10 pick in the 2014 draft by Orlando, never became the Magic\u2019s point guard of the future and was dealt to the Phoenix Suns at the trade deadline . The Suns passed on re-signing him as well. The 24-year-old, who was born in nearby Gretna, La., struggles with his outside shot, but has a variety of overall skills and has shown some triple-double tendencies in the past. Finally, the Pelicans signed Okafor for the price of a cup of gumbo. Okafor flamed out in Philly and Brooklyn, two places starved for talent at the time, which raises more red flags than a parade in China. How can the former No. 3 overall pick in the 2015 Draft and the star of a national championship team at Duke fall so fast in three years? It\u2019s telling that the rebuilding Nets, who are desperate for players, dropped him at the curb and why Okafor sat on the market for weeks this summer. Are his work habits that bad? Is his defense that atrocious? Is there an attitude issue? It\u2019s hard to keep secrets in the NBA. If the Nets didn\u2019t want him, then lots of teams didn\u2019t feel he was worth the trouble, either, even at a discount. New Orleans had nothing to lose by throwing him a lifeline and Okafor has everything to gain in filling the center gap the Pelicans have. Maybe it\u2019ll help that Okafor will learn the finer points of defense from Davis. If it doesn\u2019t work in New Orleans, Okafor\u2019s next stop might be Europe. The Pelicans\u2019 first-round pick went to Chicago in the Mirotic deal, yet their three summer signings (Okafor, Payton and Randle) are all 24 or younger anyway. On paper, the Pelicans made out quite well this summer from a cost and risk standpoint. But can either or all of the replacements for Cousins and Rondo help New Orleans return to the playoffs?

No backboard, so every shot had to go straight in or you didn\u2019t make it. \u2026 Playing basketball, it did something to me.\u201d It would be a daunting task to try to encapsulate the sport\u2019s history in 400-plus pages, so MacMullen, Bartholomew and Klores didn\u2019t even try. It was tough enough divvying up the chapters and giving proper weight to the various eras, franchises, teams and individuals. Readers who are fans of the 1970s New York Knicks probably will be delighted, those who favor the Gregg Popovich-tenure San Antonio Spurs \u2014 who didn\u2019t participate as much as some others in the project \u2014 might crave more. \u201cWe began reading through the transcripts,\u201d Bartholomew said, \u201cand ended up making sure we hit as many of the major teams, the dynasties. The \u201860s Celtics, going right into Jerry West and Elgin Baylor . We were not going to make this book without a chapter on Michael Jordan. \u201cSo there\u2019s a little of \u2018playing the hits\u2019 thing. Then we wanted to include thematic, bigger picture stuff that we knew we had to get in there, like the chapters on race, the women\u2019s game and the international game.\u201d Every interview for the ESPN Films series began with the subject stating his or her name and then explaining how he or she fell in love with basketball. Along the way, for all their experience writing about the NBA, the WNBA and college hoops, the authors learned a few things. \u201cI had heard of Connie Hawkins , but only in the context of a player and how he was involved in point-shaving,\u201d said MacMullan, senior writer for ESPN.com. \u201cThat\u2019s really all I knew. But I think one of the stars of this book is Roz Litman, his attorney, who has since passed away, and the incredible story of his [improper] blackballing.\u201d For example, famed NBA coach Don Nelson \u2014 a contemporary who attended the school, Iowa, Hawkins would have \u2014 related the pressure he felt when asked to testify about Hawkins\u2019 ability, when the league was determined to keep him out. \u201cRed Auerbach in essence threatens him,\u201d MacMullan said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve been told to tell you, if you do that, you might be done,\u2019\u201d the Boston coach told Nelson. \u201cAnd then in a little cameo role,\u201d MacMullan added, \u201cthere was a young lawyer representing the NBA who looks at the case [in 1969] and says, \u2018This isn\u2019t right. You need to let this guy in.\u2019 And that young lawyer, of course, is David Stern.\u201d Some voices are missing \u2014 Michael Jordan, Popovich and of course legends of the game who passed away before the project began. But some such as Moses Malone and Jack Ramsay make posthumous appearances, their conversations completed before their deaths in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Celtics Hall of Famer Bill Russell , a tough \u201cget\u201d for interviews, sat for more than two hours. MacMullan was wowed by Russell, as well as by his longtime adversary and shorttime teammate, big man and sports\u2019 first black general manager Wayne Embry. \u201cWayne Embry to me was a really poignant voice,\u201d she said, citing Embry\u2019s tales of racial tensions and stereotyping in the 1950s and \u201860s. \u201cI loved to cover him so much, but as much as I liked him when he was [GM] in Cleveland, he never told me a darn thing. In this book, I thought he was great.\u201d Bartholomew, a former features editor at Grantland.com, enjoyed another of the game\u2019s pioneer\/storytellers.  \u201cI think of Spencer Haywood as the interview that jumps all the way off the page and shakes you,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cHe is so funny and engaging. His personality really jumped out at me.\u201d In a chapter on Olympic basketball, for instance, Haywood is quoted: \u201cBecause of the [1968] black boycott \u2026 we were considered Uncle Toms because we played. Well, I knew what an Uncle Tom was, and I knew I wasn\u2019t that . I knew what it is to be an American. I know what freedom is.\u201d A lengthy chapter is dedicated to Jordan and the authors don\u2019t sweat any current social-media debates, titling it \u201cThe Greatest of All Time.\u201d Most of the interviews were conducted before the recent Michael vs. LeBron wrangling caught fire. \u201cFor people in the book, there\u2019s not that much debate,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cIf that becomes a talking point that brings the book into the news, that\u2019s fine with me. But I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable planting that flag for Michael Jordan.\u201d The tricky part is planting any flag at all in a crazy, ever-changing NBA, where narratives emerge, morph, rise, fall and curl back on themselves almost daily. And yet, when you hear\/read folks from Calvin Murphy to Adam Silver, from Cheryl Miller to Yao Ming, sharing the sense of calm, refuge and confidence they got from basketball, there\u2019s a common thread that stretches across the better part of a century, and it\u2019s timeless. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Per The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania and Jon Krawczynski, Butler has given the Timberwolves a list of one to three teams with which he is open to signing a contract extension. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Brooklyn Nets, LA Clippers, New York Knicks are on Butler\u2019s list of preferred trade destinations, with the Clippers looming as his favorite landing spot. Minnesota currently has no interest in trading him, Wojnarowski reports. In addition, Butler may have given the Wolves a preferred date by which he\u2019d like to be traded, reports Wojnarowski : The Star Tribune \u2018s Chris Hine reports that Wolves owner Glen Taylor would not comment on Butler\u2019s trade request when reached on Wednesday. Additionally, Hine reports that neither Butler\u2019s agent Bernie Lee nor Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau were available for comment on the topic, either. Here\u2019s more from Krawczynski on Butler\u2019s trade request : Butler holds a player option on his contract next season, but it is widely expected he will opt out and join a 2019 free-agent market that many expect to be robust. In addition, Minnesota\u2019s All-Star big man, Karl-Anthony Towns, is in the final year of his contract. Towns can sign a contract extension by Oct. 15 or else, he, too, could enter the free-agent pool next summer. Reports circulated in the offseason that Butler was frustrated with the nonchalant attitudes of Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Next season, Wiggins will begin playing on his maximum contract in 2018-19, with a $25 million-plus salary that will account for more than 20 percent of the team\u2019s cap and push the Timberwolves close to the luxury tax threshold. However, Krawczynski reports that Butler\u2019s decision to request a trade \u201chad little if anything to do\u201d with Towns and Wiggins and centered more on contractual matters. Butler posted on Twitter Monday night that he was set to meet with Timberwolves general manager Scott Layden and Thibodeau on Tuesday to discuss his future with the team. \u201cExactly why people need to stop believing what you see on the internet,\u201d Butler wrote on Twitter. \u201cI didn\u2019t have no damn meeting today \u2026 its tomorrow \u2026 I wonder what else people write and people believe hmmm \u2026\u201d Wojnarowski reported Tuesday that Thibodeau was en route to Los Angeles yesterday to meet with Butler. Originally, the sides had planned to meet in Minneapolis, but that changed. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round. Overall, Butler averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals per game on his way to All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive Second Team honors. In late June, Thibodeau said he was comfortable if Butler played the upcoming season without an extension in place, as several of the league\u2019s stars did in 2017-18. \u201cEvery day we work at it. We know how important he is, and we feel he\u2019s one of the best players in the league,\u201d Thibodeau said then. \u201cI know he loves living here. The winning is important to him, I know.\u201d Butler had an elective surgical procedure on his right hand and missed Team USA\u2019s summer practice in Las Vegas.

As the Thunder hope for a solid season and deep playoff run in 2018-19, OKC general manager Sam Presti told reporters today the team will not rush Westbrook back into the lineup. Westbrook is scheduled to have his knee injury re-evaluated in a few more weeks, which Presti said the team is waiting for before deciding anything else about their star.  \u201cWe\u2019d never push Russell or any player onto the floor. It was a pretty minor thing he had done. We\u2019ll see how that re-evaluation goes,\u201d Presti said. A re-evaluation of Westbrook\u2019s status four weeks since his surgery would be around Oct. 10. That would be six days away from OKC\u2019s regular-season opener at the Golden State Warriors ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). While the Thunder wait for Westbrook to recover from his injury, they received good news on another player coming back from injury. Guard Andre Roberson missed the final two months of the season and the 2018 playoffs with a ruptured patella tendon in his left knee . In July, the Thunder were hoping Roberson would be on track to return to training camp and that seems to be the pace Roberson is on. Roberson will go through parts of training camp, Presti said, and will participate in some non-contact drills. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be without him very long,\u201d Presti said. However, it did not sound like Roberson will be ready to play on opening night. Presti added that Roberson is doing a lot more this week than he was a week ago and is through the hardest part of his recovery process. The 6-foot-7 Roberson was an All-Defense second-team selection in 2016-17. In 39 games last season, he averaged 5.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.1 steals per game. Overall, Presti said he expects both Roberson and Westbrook to be back in the early part of the season. And, in a bit of personal news, Presti announced he and his wife had twin girls last night. The Thunder were active in the offseason, parting ways with Carmelo Anthony in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks that netted them Dennis Schroder . Additionally, they re-signed All-Star swingman Paul George and defensive-minded forward Jerami Grant while also picking up Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot, Abdel Nader and Nerlens Noel in other transactions .

Additionally, Alex Rucker has been elevated to Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations. The No. 1 overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft and 2000 Co-Rookie of the Year, Brand played in the NBA for 17 years, including parts of five seasons with the 76ers. A two-time NBA All-Star universally respected for his professionalism, relationships, determination and work ethic, Brand transitioned to a front office role with the 76ers following retirement from his playing career.  Since 2016, Brand has worked in a variety of basketball operations roles for the team, most recently as Vice President of Basketball Operations for the 76ers and General Manager of its NBA G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats. With a keen understanding of basketball strategy, a commitment to building a lasting culture, and meaningful relationships with players, agents and league executives, Brand will lead a 76ers organization coming off one of its most successful seasons in recent history. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor to be named General Manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, and for that, I want to thank Josh Harris and David Blitzer,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege of playing for this team and these amazing fans, so I understand and embrace the expectations.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Indiana Pacers 2017-18 Record:  48-34, lost in first round to Cleveland Cavaliers Who\u2019s new:  Tyreke Evans (free agency), Doug McDermott (free agency), Aaron Holiday (Draft), Kyle O\u2019Quinn (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Lance Stephenson, Al Jefferson, Glenn Robinson III The lowdown:  The Pacers were declared dead well before the season tipped off because of a forced summer trade that cost them All-Star Paul George . The basketball world snickered when the Pacers took back Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis and, well \u2026 how\u2019d that work out, anyway? Oladipo seized the moment, became the face of the franchise, an All-Star and the Kia Most Improved Player \u2014 all while delivering as much as George as a scorer. Sabonis became a solid rotational piece and led the club in rebounds. Indiana nearly won 50 games \u2014 most projections had them getting half as much \u2014 and spooked LeBron James and the Cavs in their first-round series. It was a triumph for Oladipo, coach Nate McMillan and those who saw this coming \u2026 which was like, maybe three people. The most vindicated person in the NBA last season was the man who swung the George trade, Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard. The reaction league-wide was nearly a consensus: Indiana got 50 cents on the dollar , losing a star and also taking on Oladipo\u2019s questionable (at the time) $21 million per season contract in the process. That laughter turned to applause when Oladipo emerged as a certified go-to player as the Pacers nearly upset the Cavs in the playoffs. So, what does Pritchard do for an encore? One thing\u2019s for sure: nobody would question his moves this time. And, sure enough, the Pacers made some summer roster moves that passed the smell test. They sought supplemental players who could ease Oladipo\u2019s scoring load and help him in other areas. Although there are no guarantees Indiana\u2019s newcomers will elevate it in the East, at least the list of needs was addressed. Evans was the prize addition, a strange turn considering two years ago he was trending in the opposite direction and couldn\u2019t stay healthy. He gives Indiana an off-the-ball creator who can take the last shot if necessary. Last season, he averaged 19.4 points per game and made 39.9 percent of his 3-pointers for the Memphis Grizzlies. However, Evans hasn\u2019t played a full season since 2014-15, and was limited to 52 games last season. If his body is right, he should be a solid option next to Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic, making the Pacers a bit less predictable late in games. Maybe the only downside is Evans is signed for only one season. If he performs well, he might bolt for bigger bucks next summer. Or maybe he\u2019ll feel right at home in Indiana. Evans replacing Stephenson in the lineup is an overall win-win for the Pacers. Not only is Evans a better scorer, the Pacers no longer need to cope with Lance\u2019s erratic play. Stephenson did help Indiana in spurts, but was too inconsistent to be called upon regularly. To help stretch defenses, the Pacers also added McDermott, a pure 3-point shooter. The price was surprisingly high (three years, $21 million in a soft market) and McDermott has never been a prime role player in his four years in the league. How will he respond if given 25 or 30 minutes a night, or find himself with the ball on the final play? A much more economical purchase was O\u2019Quinn, who ranked seventh last year in Rebound Percentage (22.4) among bench players . A physical rebounder and interior defender, O\u2019Quinn will add frontline depth. Poor Darren Collison. He\u2019s always had to fight for a starting point guard job, and whenever he had it, always had to fight to keep it. In his previous stint with the Pacers (2010-12), they also had George Hill. In this current go-around, Indiana brought in Cory Joseph to push Collison. Perhaps someday Holiday will replace Collison, although it\u2019s tough to imagine that happening this season. Few rookie point guards manage to start for playoff teams \u2014 much less one selected in the middle of the first round. Still, Holiday comes from good stock, as older brothers Justin (Chicago) and Jrue (New Orleans) are solid NBA players. These summer moves were designed to fortify the rotation and prove that last season was no fluke. With LeBron gone out West, the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors figure to battle for East supremacy. If Evans can average 19 ppg or so in 2018-19, Indiana figures to make it a foursome. The Pacers are a hot team now, with a bright future. The downside? They won\u2019t catch anyone by surprise this time. Coming Next:  New Orleans Pelicans * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

After months of waiting and hoping, it appears everyone on the Celtics\u2019 roster \u2014 including injured stars Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving \u2014 will be ready to go come Sept. 25. Celtics coach Brad Stevens informed the media of that on Wednesday as he spoke at the BCSF Golf Tournament at Old Sandwich Golf Club in Plymouth, Mass. Stevens has been watching as the team has held an \u201copen gym\u201d at the Celtics\u2019 practice facility in Brighton and has been impressed with what he has seen, writes Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe . \u201cAs of last I\u2019ve heard, we should have everybody full go,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cEverybody that\u2019s been here has been playing five-on-five and been looking good. \u201cThe exciting part is that we should have a full group of guys healthy and ready to go. And the tough part is that we know we\u2019ve got a lot to cover in a short amount of time.\u201d Stevens\u2019 comments about the health of the roster weren\u2019t much of a surprise, especially since Boston has been trending toward having everyone ready for camp all summer . Yesterday, Stevens said Irving and Hayward are looking much like their old selves on the court. \u201cI saw him this morning at the facility and he looks good,\u201d Stevens said of Irving. \u201cHe\u2019s worked really hard, I think he\u2019s really excited and it\u2019s good to see that. I think both he and Gordon will appreciate all the little things and all the mundane things even more, because Kyrie\u2019s had the end of the season taken away from him twice in the last four years, and the one with us last year was such a shock because of the unfortunate event with the infection.\u201d Irving and Hayward missed 22 and 81 games, respectively, with injuries last season. Irving missed the final 15 games of the 2017-18 season and the entire playoffs to repair his left knee. Hayward suffered a gruesome ankle injury just five minutes into his Celtics debut after defecting from the Utah Jazz via free agency last summer. Stevens told reporters he doesn\u2019t plan on playing anyone \u201ca ton\u201d in the preseason opener on Sept. 28 vs. the Charlote Hornets ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ). In addition, he does not expect to rest Irving or Hayward during the season unless team trainers instruct him to do so. \u201cNot my call at all,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cSo the medical team comes and says this person can\u2019t play in a back-to-back, then they don\u2019t play in a back-to-back. If they can and it\u2019s good for them, barring anything else unforeseen, then obviously they\u2019ll play. \u201cWe haven\u2019t sat in front of it and said that\u2019s the case with certain guys yet and I\u2019m not sure I anticipate that with either of those guys. They\u2019ve made great strides.\u201d Like Irving, Hayward has worked diligently to recover from his injury and Stevens has seen the progress in Hayward\u2019s recovery all along the way. The mental challenge in Hayward\u2019s comeback \u2014 taking that first hit, playing at NBA speed and more \u2014 is not something Stevens is worried about his star forward overcoming. \u201cHe\u2019s been really diligent all the way through his rehab and progressing each step,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI watched him through the steps of working out to going to one-on-one, to two-on-two, to three-on-three, and he can play some of the open gyms the guys are having. \u201cLike anything, there\u2019s always going to be a period of adjustment, but from my eye, and I think from everybody else that may have watched him work out, he looks like he\u2019s looked before. That\u2019s positive, I\u2019d say.\u201d Backup center Daniel Theis, who missed the Celtics\u2019 playoff run with a season-ending knee injury , has also looked solid in the workouts, Stevens said. Boston suffered minimal offseason roster losses among its key rotation players as only center Greg Monroe ( who signed with Toronto ) and guard Shane Larkin ( who will be playing in Turkey ) won\u2019t be back for 2018-19.

Anne Milgram, former Attorney General of New Jersey, a Professor of Practice and Distinguished Scholar at New York University School of Law, and currently Special Counsel at Lowenstein Sandler LLP, and Evan Krutoy, who spent more than 20 years as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office and currently heads Krutoy Law, P.C., led the seven-month investigation. The league\u2019s oversight function was led by David Anders, a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The report was based on information gathered from 215 interviews with current and former Mavericks employees who worked for the team during the past two decades and from the evaluation of more than 1.6 million documents, including emails and other electronic documents. Following the launch of the independent investigation, the Mavericks, under Mr. Cuban\u2019s direction, hired a new Chief Executive Officer, Cynthia Marshall, a former AT&T senior executive, who has since implemented a massive overhaul to improve the organization\u2019s workplace culture. While the investigation was ongoing, Mr. Cuban and Ms. Marshall took a series of steps to enhance the team\u2019s workplace policies and procedures. Under Ms. Marshall\u2019s direction, the Mavericks have replaced or added several new leadership positions in the organization, including a new head of Human Resources, a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, a head of Diversity & Inclusion and a new General Counsel. The Mavericks also instituted mandatory \u201cRespect in the Workplace\u201d training for all employees and ownership; created a confidential hotline for employees to share concerns, issues or allegations of misconduct; and established employee resource teams and an external advisory council to ensure a more diverse and collaborative work environment. Ms. Milgram\u2019s and Mr. Krutoy\u2019s extensive investigation, with full cooperation from Mr. Cuban and the Mavericks organization, resulted in a detailed understanding of the scope and substance of the issues. Among the investigation\u2019s key findings: The investigation report also contains a series of recommendations for changes to the Mavericks\u2019 organization, including: The report confirms that several of these steps have already been taken, including the hiring of Ms. Marshall and other new senior female leaders, and notes that \u201cwe heard from employees of a sea change in the professional environment at the Mavericks that began almost immediately following\u201d the publication of the Sports Illustrated article. In recognition of the institutional and other failures set forth in the report, Mr. Cuban has agreed to contribute $10 million to organizations that are committed to supporting the leadership and development of women in the sports industry and combating domestic violence. These organizations will be selected by an advisory council of leaders from the Mavericks, including Mr. Cuban and Ms. Marshall, and the NBA, including President of Social Responsibility & Player Programs Kathy Behrens, President of Team Marketing & Business Operations and Chief Innovation Officer Amy Brooks, and Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer Oris Stuart. Additionally, the NBA is requiring the Mavericks to: \u201cThe findings of the independent investigation are disturbing and heartbreaking and no employee in the NBA, or any workplace for that matter, should be subject to the type of working environment described in the report,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cWe appreciate that Mark Cuban reacted swiftly, thoroughly and transparently to the allegations first set forth in Sports Illustrated \u2013 including the immediate hiring of Cynthia Marshall as CEO to effect change, but as Mark has acknowledged, he is ultimately responsible for the culture and conduct of his employees. While nothing will undo the harm caused by a select few former employees of the Mavericks, the workplace reforms and the $10 million that Mark has agreed to contribute are important steps toward rectifying this past behavior and shining a light on a pervasive societal failing \u2014 the inability of too many organizations to provide a safe and welcoming workplace for women.\u201d Following the allegations made in the Sports Illustrated article, the NBA conducted a thorough review of its existing policies and procedures related to respect in the workplace, and required all NBA teams to do the same. In addition, the league established a confidential leaguewide hotline for team and league employees to report workplace misconduct including, but not limited to, sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation. While many of the recommendations contained in the investigation report are already part of established practice at the league office, any that are not will shortly be adopted.

In an interview with Spectrum SportsNet that will air at 8 p.m. PT today, Lakers coach Luke Walton said Ball will not participate in full-contact practice when the Lakers open training camp next week. Ball had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in mid-July . Here\u2019s more from ESPN\u2019s Ohm Youngmisuk on what Walton had to say : When Ball had his surgery on July 13, the Lakers\u2019 official statement said: \u201cBall is expected to make a full recovery by the start of the 2018-19 training camp.\u201d However, that appears to not be the case come the open of camp next Monday . The Lakers posted video on Sept. 8 on their website of Ball taking part in various summer workout drills , but he has not appeared in videos the team has produced from team scrimmages . Ball played in just 52 games during his rookie season, but was back on the court in early June and said he was feeling \u201c100 percent\u201d following a knee procedure . Per reports, the former No. 2 overall pick received a platelet-rich plasma shot for the ailing left knee that kept him out of the final portion of the regular season. In the 2017-18 season, Ball averaged 10.2 points, 7.2 assists and 6.9 rebounds per contest while shooting 36 percent en route to earning NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. Over the summer, the Lakers added veteran guard Rajon Rondo to a training camp point guard rotation that also includes Alex Caruso, Issac Bonga and Joel Berry II. Marquee free-agent addition LeBron James is a more than skilled NBA playmaker as well. He could easily initiate and direct some of the Lakers\u2019 offense in 2018-19."},{"id":38681,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-two-teams-eastern-conference-you-will-be-watching-camps-open","date":"2018-09-19","title":"Blogtable: Two teams in Eastern Conference you'll be watching as camps open?","content":"* * * As camps open in the coming days , which two teams in the East will you be keeping an eye on and why?  * * * Steve Aschburner : The Raptors and Bucks. I\u2019m keeping an eye on the Raptors because they\u2019ve made dramatic changes at the risk of being too clever by half. Dwane Casey fired, Nick Nurse promoted, Kawhi Leonard acquired, DeMar DeRozan traded \u2026 when maybe all they needed was to have LeBron \u2014 the human wall physically and mentally between them and an Eastern Conference title \u2014 move his business westward. The Bucks, meanwhile, wasted a year of development and potential progress in 2017-18, in my opinion. With a new coaching staff and system, and with a shiny new arena as a diversion from real urgency, Milwaukee needs to take a major step this season and embrace its obligation to maximize Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s career. Otherwise the incessant media rumors about his eventual departure will be on them. Shaun Powell : The Celtics and Raptors. It\u2019s just a coincidence that they happen to be the two teams with the best chance to win the conference. They get the magnifying glass here because of other issues, mainly injury comebacks. How does Gordon Hayward look in camp? Kyrie Irving? And with both in the fold, what rotation will Celtics coach Brad Stevens use? As for the Raptors, it\u2019s all about Kawhi Leonard \u2014 not only his health, too, but how well his teammates take to him. (Namely, Kyle Lowry, also known as BFF to DeMar DeRozan.) This will ultimately determine what Kawhi does next summer in free agency. John Schuhmann :  The Sixers and Raptors. All eyes are on Markelle Fultz in Philly. If he can rebound from a rough rookie season and can shoot well enough to play alongside Ben Simmons, he could raise the Sixers\u2019 ceiling rather dramatically. In Toronto, it\u2019s about how Kawhi Leonard looks after missing almost the entire 2017-18 season, but also how new coach Nick Nurse might tweak the Raptors\u2019 style of play, whether Serge Ibaka can rebound from an ugly postseason and if OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam can start to realize their potential. There\u2019s also some intrigue in Detroit and Milwaukee to see if relocated (and accomplished) coaches can iron out the issues that plagued two pretty talented teams last season.  Sekou Smith :  The Sixers and Wizards strike me as the most intriguing teams heading into training camp. We all know the Celtics and Raptors should be stocked and ready to chase the top spot in the conference vacated by the Cleveland Cavaliers when LeBron James departed for Los Angeles. The Sixers went into free agency hunting a big name and came up empty. But they have a wild card in Markelle Fultz who could fill the void of that big name free agent if he\u2019s ready to take off after his strange rookie season. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid should have plenty of motivation to come back with a vengeance this season, given the way the Celtics ran them out of the playoffs . Meanwhile, the Wizards begin this season the way they seem to approach every one in recent years. Their internal belief in who they are usually dwarfs the reality of their situation. With their first significant change to the starting lineup in years ( Dwight Howard for Marcin Gortat ), I can\u2019t wait to see how they get their chemistry together now that both John Wall and Bradley Beal have established themselves as All-Stars.

The first one is for obvious reasons, given the circus atmosphere and presumed culture change that will accompany LeBron James\u2019 arrival. The second is more personal, given my time logged in Minnesota and Chicago, and my familiarity with the Timberwolves\u2019 people, history and tribulations. Or would that now be Thibs-ulations? Jimmy Butler needs his best year from his best self, team-wise, while seeding aside his Summer of \u201919 focus. Grabbing at the reigns of leadership isn\u2019t the same as actually leading with what a team needs. Shaun Powell : The Lakers and Wolves. Naturally, there\u2019s a LeBron James-created buzz that begins the moment he appears in uniform on Monday for media day. How he bonds with the Lakers\u2019 young core and their interesting mix of vets on one-year deals will dictate the Lakers\u2019 success in the short-term. As for the Wolves, this team is nuts right now, with Jimmy Butler calling a meeting before camp and Karl-Anthony Towns refusing (so far) to sign a contract extension. Where\u2019s the love? John Schuhmann :  The Lakers and Timberwolves. In L.A., there\u2019s intrigue in how this is going to work with LeBron James and a very different kind of supporting cast than he had in Cleveland. There are questions in regard to both how they\u2019re going to play (especially offensively) and what their rotation will look like (is James going to play some center?). In Minnesota, it\u2019s about the future of Jimmy Butler, who can become a free agent next summer and who clearly isn\u2019t 100 percent happy with how things have gone since he was traded to the Wolves 15 months ago . This is one of the most talented teams in the league, but it hasn\u2019t made the most of its talent (mostly because of the defensive end of the floor). If Butler tells Tom Thibodeau that he\u2019s not going to stick around, trade season is starting early, with one of the league\u2019s best two-way players on the market.  Sekou Smith :  The Lakers and Rockets will be hard to ignore. They\u2019re both chasing the Warriors in the race to the top in the conference and the league. The Rockets start just behind the Warriors after earning the top spot in the regular season a year ago. Carmelo Anthony\u2019s addition gives Mike D\u2019Antoni an intriguing option as a third option alongside reigning Kia MVP James Harden and star guard Chris Paul. I don\u2019t know if they can get on that horse they rode to the best record in the league last season this time around. They couldn\u2019t escape the Warriors win Game 7 of the conference finals at home, so the expectations can\u2019t get any higher in Houston. The Lakers are always grabbing headlines, even when they were struggling. With LeBron James in town, the spotlight will be white hot from the first whistle of training camp until his first season in L.A. ends. Where it ends, of course, will be the most interesting story to watch all season. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of rotations forms around him."},{"id":38716,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-which-player-has-most-prove-start-2018-19-nba-season","date":"2018-09-19","title":"Blogtable: Player who has most to prove to start 2018-19 season?","content":" * * * Gaze into your crystal ball and tell me: which player has the most to prove to start the 2018-19 season?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Kawhi Leonard. The season-long drama over his fitness demands answers, both on the court and from his lips. Enough with the coy. Time for a grown man to deal with other grown men and women properly, and that includes the Spurs fans, through the media. Leonard doesn\u2019t have to cut open a vein and give us Manu. We\u2019ll settle for him being an adult and giving us a proper, mature Tim, with a dry but full state-of-Kawhi address. Then he needs to go out and dominate at both ends like his old self, and not waste another year. Shaun Powell :  Markelle Fultz, just barely ahead of Paul George (who must hold it down until Russell Westbrook heals ) and Carmelo Anthony (can he help Houston?). The Sixers need to know if Fultz has overcome his serious case of the shooting yips. They protected him by keeping him out of NBA Summer League, but the curtain\u2019s about to open on his progress. The No. 1 overall pick of the 2017 Draft must instill confidence in the coaching staff and teammates right away, or risk becoming an outcast on a team that could shake up the East if not the NBA. John Schuhmann :  This is a long list that obviously starts with Markelle Fultz and Kawhi Leonard ( see the question about East teams to keep an eye on ), and also includes Carmelo Anthony, Eric Bledsoe, Blake Griffin, Rodney Hood, Dwight Howard, Serge Ibaka, Jabari Parker, Myles Turner, Hassan Whiteside and Andrew Wiggins. But one name that also sticks out is D\u2019Angelo Russell. The former No. 2 pick is in the last year of his rookie deal (and Brooklyn general manager Sean Marks made it pretty clear on Tuesday that no contract extension is coming) and has yet to show that he\u2019s the Nets\u2019 (or anybody\u2019s) point guard of the future. He has shown flashes of special talent and is still only 22 years old, but has had issues with consistency, decision-making (shot selection in particular) and defense. The Nets were a better team with Russell off the floor last season and, in Spencer Dinwiddie (also a free agent next summer), Russell has competition at point guard. It will be fascinating to see which of them (if either) is on the Brooklyn roster at this point next year.  Sekou Smith :  All eyes will be (and should be) on Carmelo Anthony in Houston. He never was a great fit in Oklahoma City trying to operate as the third option behind Russell Westbrook and Paul George. So what gives anyone the confidence that it\u2019ll be any better with \u2018Melo playing third fiddle behind James Harden and Chris Paul? Well, the Rockets have already been through a successful season of integrating a new superstar into their mix. (Paul\u2019s first season with the Rockets might have ended in The Finals if not for that hamstring injury he suffered in Game 5 of the West finals ). They should be better equipped to manage Anthony\u2019s transition than the Thunder were. Still, there\u2019s the chance that this whole thing goes sideways. And that alone will keep plenty of attention on the goings on in Houston this season. He\u2019s been an easy target before, in his departures from Denver, New York and Oklahoma City, so there\u2019s no reason to believe \u2018Melo will escape that same fate if things go awry in Houston. Call me crazy, but I think things work out much better with the Rockets."},{"id":38683,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/30-teams-30-days-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2018-09-19","title":"30 Teams in 30 Days: San Antonio Spurs seek stability after a turbulent summer","content":" What offseason?  That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  San Antonio Spurs 2017-18 Record:  47-35, lost in first round to Golden State Warriors Who\u2019s new:  DeMar DeRozan (trade), Jakob Poeltl (trade), Dante Cunningham (free agency), Marco Belinelli (free agency), Quincy Pondexter (free agency), Lonnie Walker IV (Draft). Who\u2019s gone:  Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili (retired), Danny Green, Kyle Anderson The lowdown:  For one of the few times in the Gregg Popovich era, the Spurs felt the kind of turbulence that other teams endure. The proud franchise dealt with the quiet yet destructive storm caused by Leonard, who played only nine games and missed the playoffs because of strangely persistent quad injury that confused and annoyed coaches, players and Spurs fans. A wedge of distrust was formed between Leonard, an NBA Finals hero and considered by many to be the NBA\u2019s best two-way player, and a team that prided itself on stability, professionalism and good relationships with its stars. But, the Spurs being the Spurs, they found a way to prosper anyway \u2026 thanks to the heavy lifting by All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge and the disciplined play of San Antonio\u2019s veterans. Their playoff exit was quick and observers wondered how long it would take for the transitioning Spurs to enjoy the view from the top again. The breakup between Leonard and the Spurs was painful, confusing, somewhat regretful and, ultimately necessary. The relationship between Leonard and the Spurs reached the predictable bitter ending. There\u2019s nothing pretty about an in-their-prime star being traded by the only team he\u2019s ever known , especially when it involves a franchise like the Spurs. Leonard was projected as the team\u2019s next star after David Robinson and Tim Duncan, but sometimes the basketball gods laugh at the best-laid plans. Leonard is now in Toronto, putting an end to one of the strangest sagas in recent memory. What, exactly, happened between Leonard and the Spurs may never be known because Popovich isn\u2019t telling and Leonard doesn\u2019t talk. It makes no difference, though, as the Spurs have moved on minus their former star player. Replacing Leonard is DeRozan, who wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled to leave Toronto, which is no disrespect to the Spurs. DeRozan was the opposite of Leonard \u2014 someone who wanted to spend his basketball life with the team that drafted him. DeRozan is neither the defender nor the clutch playoff scorer Leonard is. However, DeRozan is a legit scorer with a reliable mid-range game and an improving 3-point shot. He must develop a chemistry with the big man, Aldridge, after sharing a solid vibe with All-Star guard Kyle Lowry in Toronto. The Spurs also had to surrender Green in the trade, who is a solid defender and a career 39.5 percent 3-point shooter . Green\u2019s presence and ability to stretch the floor made life easier for Aldridge, who may not enjoy the same advantage with DeRozan. Poeltl, a mobile 7-footer, also came over in the Leonard trade. The reliable reserve big man improved his offensive game in 2017-18 and was a key part of Toronto\u2019s 59-win season. The Spurs\u2019 system \u2014 and playing alongside veteran Pau Gasol \u2014 might help Poeltl develop further if he doesn\u2019t fall into the I\u2019m-just-here-to-set-picks mindset that plagues some young bigs. Leonard might not receive the warmest reception when he makes his return to San Antonio this season ( 8 ET, Jan. 3 on TNT ). Yet it\u2019s guaranteed Parker will get nothing short of a standing ovation and tearful video tribute. He reached the end of the line after 17 mostly glorious years in San Antonio because of declining skills and a desire by the Spurs to groom their young point guards instead. So Parker signed with the Charlotte Hornets (coached by ex-Spurs assistant James Borrego), believing he can still be a solid contributor despite being an \u201cold\u201d 36. The other heart-wrenching departure was caused by the retirement of Ginobili, who called it quits and, unlike Parker, spent his entire 16-year career with the Spurs. This means for the first time since the pre-Robinson days, the Spurs won\u2019t have a home-grown star on the roster. The Spurs decided not to match the reported four-year, $37 million offer the Memphis Grizzlies gave Anderson, a restricted free agent. Anderson was a student of the Spurs\u2019 player-development program and was a fixture in the rotation. His fundamental style seemed perfect for the Spurs, yet clearly, \u201cSlo Mo\u201d lacked the speed and quickness needed at small forward to become more than just a role player. The Spurs have enjoyed success with mid-to-late first-round picks and, at No. 18, took Walker IV. He\u2019s a lively guard who\u2019ll make the NBA\u2019s All-Hairstyle team before he plays a minute. The 6-foot-4 guard  will become another pet project for the Spurs\u2019 development program in hopes that he and Murray will someday become the team\u2019s backcourt of the future. In the meantime, the Spurs signed Belinelli for a second tour in San Antonio. Belinelli is a trusted 3-point shooter ( 37.7 percent for his career ) who should fill some of the void left behind by Green. It was the busiest offseason in recent memory for the Spurs, an organization that rarely makes big trades and, with the exception of Aldridge , almost never signs big-name free agents. That\u2019s not to suggest the Spurs are suddenly changing their approach. They\u2019ll continue to grow organically, as evidenced by Murray, Bryn Forbes (who was given an extension) and now, Walker IV. But this was a summer that shook the franchise and tested the limits of Popovich, who\u2019ll turn 70 this season and may take a long look at his own future in San Antonio.

The two-time All-Star signed with the Nuggets on July 12. Thomas, the 60th and last pick of the 2011 NBA Draft, made a name for himself as a clutch scorer with the Boston Celtics after his previous two teams (Sacramento and Phoenix) parted ways with him. In two-and-a-half seasons with Boston, the 5-foot-9 guard averaged 24.7 points and six assists per game. In 2016-17, Thomas was the driving force behind the Celtics\u2019 run to the Eastern Conference Finals while earning All-NBA Second Team honors along the way. That playoff run ended, however, with a hip injury that lingered well past Boston dealing him to Cleveland in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Thomas played just 15 games for the Cavaliers before he was again dealt, this time to the Los Angeles Lakers. He suited up in 17 games for the Lakers before hip surgery ended a season in which he shot just 37.3 percent. Over the summer, the Nuggets re-signed star center Nikola Jokic and sixth man Will Barton to a long-term contracts on July 9, roughly two weeks after drafting Michael Porter Jr. with the No. 14 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft .

While Leonard has remained mum on the move, Ujiri said he\u2019s not concerned about the 27-year-old\u2019s commitment to the franchise, saying Leonard worked out with Raptors coaches in Los Angeles, and has visited Toronto a couple of times. \u201cBasketball person. Just loves the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWants to play the game and very competitive. You can tell he is a very competitive kid. It\u2019s about basketball. Once you just start to talk about basketball his eyes change.\u201d The Raptors open training camp next week in Vancouver, and Ujiri said Leonard, who had a much-discussed falling-out with the Spurs, won\u2019t get any special treatment. \u201cThere is nothing we are going to do different. We are going to be ourselves. I think the situation with him in San Antonio, which I don\u2019t want to talk about because I don\u2019t know much about it, but he\u2019s a quiet kid,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThat\u2019s his nature. We can\u2019t all be the same kind of people. But he is as engaging as he would want to be and he\u2019s very interesting. There is no maintenance with him. There are no tons of people around him. His [focus] is on basketball which is what you want. He is a basketball junkie.\u201d Ujiri said it was a difficult decision to trade DeRozan and that veteran guard Kyle Lowry also took the trade hard. Lowry refused to discuss the trade with reporters during a U.S. national team training camp in Las Vegas in late July. \u201cKyle is close to DeMar and he\u2019s going to be sensitive,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThat was a blow to him. I think basketball-wise Kyle is always ready, he\u2019s always going to be ready, he\u2019s training hard and he\u2019ll be ready.\u201d"},{"id":38677,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-philadelphia-sixers-hire-elton-brand-general-manager","date":"2018-09-18","title":"Reports: Philadelphia Sixers promote Elton Brand to general manager","content":"Elton Brand is in charge of the Philadelphia 76ers. According to multiple media reports, the Sixers have made Brand their new general manager, replacing Bryan Colangelo. Colangelo resigned in June as the 76ers\u2019 president of basketball operations after what an investigation concluded was \u201ccareless and in some instances reckless\u201d sharing of sensitive team information on Twitter. Brand is expected to be introduced at a news conference on Thursday. Brand had worked for the Sixers as vice president of operations and also served as the general manager of the Delaware Blue Coats, the 76ers\u2019 G League affiliate. Brand was the No. 1 pick of the 1999 draft by the Chicago Bulls and played two stints with the Sixers. Keith Pompey of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Brand\u2019s move into the GM role is a popular one with Sixers players : Sixers coach Brett Brown had served as Philadelphia\u2019s interim GM and said earlier Tuesday he wasn\u2019t interested in holding both jobs. Brown pledged the Sixers would name a general manager before the season started. \u201cThis is not something that interests me. I do not believe in the role that I have as a head coach that it\u2019s tenable,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will have, to the best of my knowledge, a general manager appointed, announced by the start of the season. And it\u2019s not me. It was never going to be.\u201d Hours later, the Sixers had their guy. Brand played in 1,058 career games over 18 seasons with the Bulls, the Los Angeles Clippers, Dallas, Atlanta and the Sixers. He posted career averages of 16 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks per game. A two-time All-Star and the 2000 rookie of the year, Brand was also the recipient of the 2005-06 Joe Dumars Trophy, presented each season to the player who exemplifies the ideals of sportsmanship on the court. The Sixers won 52 games last season and beat Miami in the first round of the playoffs before they were eliminated in the conference semifinals by Boston. Under Brown\u2019s watch, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have blossomed into two of the top young players in the league. The Sixers were rocked when an independent review found that Colangelo\u2019s wife, Barbara Bottini, operated four Twitter accounts it investigated, and she admitted using private information to criticize the Sixers and rival colleagues. Colangelo and his predecessor Sam Hinkie, who hired Brown, had the final say in player personnel decisions. Brown said he was looking \u201cfor a partner\u201d in personnel moves with the new GM. \u201cI do have a voice.

Waiters has not recovered sufficiently enough from left ankle surgery to be ready for the start of training camp next week, the team announced Tuesday. Heat President Pat Riley said it\u2019s unlikely that Waiters will be ready for the start of the regular season as well. The announcement wasn\u2019t a total surprise because Waiters was told when he had the procedure in mid-January that he could be sidelined for up to 10 months. \u201cDion will not be returning to the court until the Heat medical team and training staff deem him healed, rehabbed and physically conditioned for all basketball activities,\u201d Riley said. Heat point guard Goran Dragic was taken aback by the news. \u201cThis is kind of out of the blue for me,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cAt the end of the day, he knows what is best for him. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s going to be ready when we need him.\u201d Waiters is due to make about $11.5 million this season, the second year of a four-year deal. He has incentives based on games played, and cashing in on those already seems to be in some doubt as his recovery and rehabilitation program \u2013 which has allowed him to take part in some shooting drills in recent weeks \u2013 continues. While his loss will be felt, shooting guard is a position of serious depth for Miami even with Waiters sidelined. The Heat are loaded with wings, a list that includes Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, Wayne Ellington, Rodney McGruder \u2013 and now, Dwyane Wade, who announced earlier this week that he\u2019s coming back for his 16th and final NBA season. Wade officially signed his one-year, $2.4 million contract Tuesday . \u201cWe are very delighted that Dwyane decided to return,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI believe that Dwyane can play a big part in us winning. That\u2019s what he is all about. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s back.\u201d The issue with Waiters\u2019 left ankle has gone on for the last 18 months. Waiters was driving into the lane early in a game against Minnesota on March 17, 2017, when he turned the ankle. He missed the final 13 games of that season, one in which the Heat \u2013 who started 11-30, then went 30-11 in their final 41 games \u2013 lost a tiebreaker for the last Eastern Conference playoff spot. He labored through the start of last season, and when he twisted the ankle again on Dec. 22, he expected to be sidelined for a few games at the most. Waiters hasn\u2019t played in a game since. In 30 games last season, Waiters averaged 14.3 points.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team:  Minnesota Timberwolves 2017-18 Record:  47-35, lost in first round to Houston Rockets Who\u2019s new:  Josh Okogie (Draft); Keita Bates-Diop (Draft); Anthony Tolliver (free agency), Luol Deng (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Nemanja Bjelica, Cole Aldrich The lowdown: There was a collective sigh within the franchise, led by coach Tom Thibodeau, when the Timberwolves qualified for the playoffs on the final night of the regular season . To sit out the postseason would have been an embarrassing setback for Thibodeau and a young up-and-coming team that acquired Jimmy Butler the previous offseason to bring toughness and experience. Despite missing 21 games, Butler was an All-Star and a solid two-way player for Minnesota. Karl-Anthony Towns made strides in his third season and pushed himself among the elite centers at age 22. But the production from the rest of the rotation was annoyingly inconsistent, none more than Andrew Wiggins, who was fresh off a massive contract extension . Butler came to Minnesota to bring leadership and teach the finer points of defense. But reports circulated last season that he was discouraged by the work ethic of the younger Wolves, a similar complaint leveled by Butler when he was with the Bulls. Butler\u2019s a no-nonsense guy and perhaps to the extreme, and maybe he\u2019ll never be satisfied next to young and mistake-prone players. Still, this is alarming, given Butler\u2019s status on the club \u2014 he averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals \u2014 and after his perhaps best-ever NBA season. Is he a unifying leader who\u2019s just showing tough love, or a pain in the rear? Towns is said to be rubbed the wrong way by Butler and other issues with the Wolves. Again, Towns has not gone on a public rant, but actions speak louder than words. And, unlike Andrew Wiggins, Towns has not signed a contract extension. Could he be leveraging his way out of town at some point, or is he just showing some business savvy? His situation bears watching as Towns is a gifted big man with vast skills and is an above-average defender. If he\u2019s not a max-money player, then he\u2019s close enough. There\u2019s still the chance Towns signs before the season starts and if he doesn\u2019t, then it raises legitimate questions. (For that matter, Butler hasn\u2019t signed an extension , either, but it\u2019s not clear whether an offer was even made this summer.) And then there\u2019s Wiggins, the club\u2019s highest paid player at $26 million annually, who took a minor step backward last season. Sure, the scoring decline ( from 23.6 ppg to 17.7 ppg ) probably had something to do with Butler\u2019s arrival. Yet Wiggins faltered in other areas, too, mainly shooting accuracy and defense. Mostly, the Wolves are still waiting for him to take a step toward stardom, and for the first time in his four-year career, there\u2019s some question whether he\u2019ll ever be a game-changer. Minnesota\u2019s summer was heavy on innuendo and light on player movement, the latter being understandable as the Wolves try to devlop their core players. Jamal Crawford, 38, seems set to leave town after he curiously declined a player option that would\u2019ve paid roughly $5 million. Maybe Crawford was fed up with the atmosphere, too? In the first round of the Draft, the Wolves took Okogie, a raw prospect from Nigeria who played two seasons at Georgia Tech. His athletic and defensive ability are off the charts, which is what sold him on Thibodeau. In that sense, Okogie is a younger version of Butler \u2014 at least as a defender. He just turned 20 and will be an interesting pet project in the Wolves\u2019 player-development system. In the second round they found Bates-Diop, who was considered a late first-round prospect prior to the Draft. He averaged almost 20 points for Ohio State, was Big Ten Player of the Year and had a solid showing in NBA Summer League play. However, he might find playing time tough to get, initially, in Minnesota. The Wolves didn\u2019t make any major trades, which makes sense. Although they didn\u2019t qualify for the playoffs until the final game, and their overall results in the Thibodeau era are somewhat disappointing, the Wolves want this core to grow together. Question is, will they grow fondly of each other? The West is suddenly teeming with up-and-comers, with the Denver Nuggets and Utah Jazz arguably better than Minnesota. Plus, the Los Angeles Lakers are trending north with LeBron James. If the Wolves aren\u2019t careful, they could lose their place in line.

Barry ranks 34th all-time in three-pointers made (1,395) and 23rd all-time in three-point percentage (.405). He holds career averages of 9.2 points, 3.2 assists and 3.0 rebounds in 912 NBA contests.

The Oklahoma City Thunder won\u2019t fall off the face of the earth if it has to play a few weeks without Russell Westbrook, who underwent yet another knee operation last week , this one in Los Angeles. Oklahoma City said that Westbrook, who\u2019s had four operations on his right knee before last week\u2019s procedure, would be re-evaluated in four weeks \u2013 making it fairly likely Westbrook will miss at least a couple of regular-season games. Not ideal, but the Thunder should survive a brief absence from the NBA\u2019s 2017 Kia MVP winner . Still, OKC fans remember what it was like to try and play without him. And that\u2019s the same shudder every fan base feels when it sees their best player in street clothes. The Phoenix Suns, able to dream almost all summer about getting off to a quick start and gaining confidence early, now instead must contemplate surviving until Devin Booker returns from unexpected hand surgery last week . Conversely, when a team gets back a key guy, as the Boston Celtics will with the return of Gordon Hayward when camps open , it\u2019s a shot of adrenaline. So, with camps around the league on the verge of opening in the next two weeks, it\u2019s a good time to provide updates on critical players injured during last season or in the playoffs. Injury:  Strained right hamstring Date: 5\/24\/18 Missed:  Games 6, 7 of Western Conference finals Paul was cleared to return weeks ago and was a full participant during the players\u2019 week-long workouts\/get together in the Bahamas late last month (as was Carmelo Anthony). But Houston\u2019s acquisitions of Brandon Knight from the Suns and Michael Carter-Williams in free agency speak to the Rockets\u2019 belief they had to bolster their point guard spot in case Paul is knocked out of action again next season. Injury:  Surgery, left heel; Achilles\u2019 Date:  1\/27\/18 Missed:  70 games  The Grizzlies\u2019 quarterback is, finally, a full go . He\u2019s returned to on-court activities and has played five-on-five recently with no limitations. A return to form for Conley is crucial for Memphis, despite all the good moves the Grizzlies made during the offseason in the Draft (Jaren Jackson, Jr. and Jevon Carter), free agency (Kyle Anderson) and trades (Garrett Temple). None of it will matter if Conley isn\u2019t there to pull it all together and take pressure off Marc Gasol with his shooting and distributing abilities. \u201cRight now he\u2019s in full participation in everything we\u2019re doing,\u201d Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Monday morning of Conley. \u201cObviously we kind of keep an eye on him. In training camp, our expectation is that he\u2019s full go. The good thing about training camp is you have enough bodies that the reps get spread out. We don\u2019t have any expectation of Mike missing anything. As the season goes, we\u2019ll keep an eye on him. When we added some of the depth on our team, we don\u2019t have to kill Mike and Marc from a minutes perspective. Rather than getting into restrictions, their average minutes don\u2019t have to be 36, 38 minutes to carry the team.\u201d Injury:  Ruptured left Achilles\u2019 Date:  1\/26\/18 Missed:  43 games (including playoffs with Pelicans) Though Cousins expressed some optimism earlier in the summer that he could participate in training camp, cooler heads have prevailed, and he won\u2019t be taking part. The whole point of signing him was to have him ready for the playoffs, not Game 22. So while Cousins will be at camp, and shows signs of getting his ups back , he won\u2019t be on the court. Coach Steve Kerr\u2019s plan is for the coaches to watch a ton of film with Cousins, show him the Warriors\u2019 video playbook and concepts and keep him involved during practice. Golden State thinks Cousins watching how the rest of the group vibes with one another will be good for him as he finishes his rehab, and will allow him to transition back to playing easier. Injury:  Knee surgery Date:  4\/7\/18 Missed:  34 games (including playoffs) Irving was cleared for basketball activities in late July and expects to be ready for the start of camp . He\u2019ll be under no minutes restrictions once the regular season begins, according to a source. (What remains unclear is how coach Brad Stevens can manage the minutes at point guard between Irving, Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier without someone getting out of sorts.) Injury:  Torn left ACL Date:  2\/6\/18 Missed:  34 games The Knicks have not provided an update on Porzingis\u2019s level of physical clearance yet. But he has been rehabbing during the summer in Europe, and it has progressed well so far. People from the Knicks have been in consistent communication with Porzingis\u2019 people in Europe that he\u2019s working with. He will be in New York when camp begins, and the team and its medical staff will meet with Porzingis and his surgeon. It would be crazy for either party to rush, even as the Knicks contemplate how much to offer their young star in a potential contract extension; as a member of the 2015 Draft class, Porzingis is eligible for one. The deadline is Oct. 15. Injury:  Ruptured left patella tendon Date:  1\/27\/18 Missed:  33 games The 26-year-old Roberson will be with the team when camp begins. He has been with the Thunder all summer and been on the floor doing drill work and shooting , though he is not yet cleared for either contact work or five on five play. The Thunder will obviously be conservative with him as he nears his return to play. But the important part is that Roberson is progressing toward a return. It\u2019s simple: OKC craters defensively when he isn\u2019t on the court. When Roberson was on the court last season, the Thunder\u2019s Defensive Rating was 96.4. When he was off the floor, that number soared to 107.6. Injury : Pulled left hamstring Date:  4\/27\/18 Missed:  Semifinals vs. Houston Rockets Rubio has been good to go since mid-summer and is a full go for camp. Good news for Utah, which flourished with Rubio on the floor the second half of the season. After the All-Star break, he had a +10 plus-minus (a lot of that, clearly, is also due to the return of Rudy Gobert to the floor), and shot 40.9 percent on 3-pointers after hitting 32.4 percent of them before the break. Injury:  Torn right meniscus Date:  11\/7\/17 Missed:  71 games  Beverley is all the way back and \u201clooks great,\u201d per a league spy who\u2019s seen him ( here is more evidence from this summer ) from the microfracture surgery of last November. He\u2019ll enter camp with no limitations. Injury:  Sprained left MCL Date:  3\/7\/18 Missed:  17 games  Fournier was cleared to return to the court weeks ago; he played for Team Africa (his mother is Algerian) in the NBA Africa Game in South Africa in early August . And Orlando didn\u2019t seriously entertain trade talks for him; a team that finished 24th in the league in scoring last season probably needs to retain its leading scorer."},{"id":38714,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-mailbag-september-18-2018","date":"2018-09-17","title":"Morning Tip Mailbag: Your questions on future Hall of Famers, Mario Hezonja and more","content":" A Penny for Your Thoughts. From Nick Ivory: You can certainly make a case for Penny, Nick. Based on my Andrew Toney Test described last week, even though Penny\u2019s elite days as a pro were limited because of injury, he was surely dominant when he was healthy. He and Shaq were pretty dominant in those years when the Magic made The Finals and were the only Eastern Conference team in seven years to beat a Bulls team with Michael Jordan on it. Humbly, I would say C-Webb has a better case than Penny, though, based on his high school and college play\/influence as well as what he did in the pros. I Fail Geography, Part MCMXXXVII. From James Allen: You prove, yet again, that when it comes to the nations of the world, I remain a dope. Thank you, James. Super Mario? From Danny Milmore: I think Hezonja can help the Knicks as well, Danny. He had a strong second half offensively last season in Orlando, and despite his ups and downs with the Magic, he remains a still-intriguing package at 23 in a prove-it season. Don\u2019t have a feel for minutes just yet; it\u2019s hard to predict before knowing who comes to camp in shape, whether New York has anything cooking trade-wise (including for Lee), etc. But: in David Fizdale\u2019s one full season in Memphis, he got minutes for wings like James Ennis, and Fizdale is huge on player development. Also, GM Scott Perry pushed for Hezonja while he was an executive with the Magic. So he\u2019ll get every chance in New York, maybe alongside Lee, who\u2019s a much better defender and could help cover for Hezonja on cross-matches.

If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! 5 \u2013 Number of Celtics players \u2014 Kyrie irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford \u2014 ranked among Sports Illustrated \u2019s preseason Top 50 ( the magazine\u2019s Top 100 list is here ). That total is the most of any team in the league. Even Golden State only had four of its five starters make the list; Houston (James Harden, Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Eric Gordon) also put four in the Top 50. 57 \u2014 Total games played in two seasons in Los Angeles by Luol Deng, who signed with the Timberwolves last week after reaching a settlement with the Lakers on the remaining two years and $32 million he was due from the team. The 33-year-old Deng maintains he\u2019s healthy after numerous injuries. 1,088 \u2014 Career games played by Ben Wallace , the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in games played by a player who went undrafted. Among active players, Detroit\u2019s Jose Calderon is the next-highest undrafted player with 846 career games played; Miami\u2019s Udonis Haslem , who officially re-signed with the Heat last week for a 16th season in South Florida , is right behind Calderon at 844 career games. 1) One last dance, D-Wade? I can go for that. 2) The Magic will be getting a good one in Bill Pope if he, as The New York Times \u2019 Marc Stein reported last week, goes to Orlando as its new director of pro personnel, after years in Sacramento in a similar position with the Kings. A basketball lifer, Pope was manager of the 1988 national championship Kansas team, and has excelled in a variety of jobs in coaching and scouting ever since. Good hire. 3) Kudos to Kenny Anderson, who took the head coaching job at Fisk University last week. 4) One of the most clever uses of team social media I\u2019ve ever seen . Kudos to the Stars. http:\/\/twitter.com\/DallasStars\/status\/1040285920858136576 1) Jimmy Butler\u2019s unhappiness in Minnesota will reportedly be addressed today in a meeting between him, Tom Thibodeau and GM Scott Layden . I\u2019m told, though, that while Butler has serious questions about the direction of the franchise, he\u2019s still willing to hear Minnesota out, and isn\u2019t dead set on demanding a trade elsewhere. Stay tuned.  2) Not arguing the merits of this case . I don\u2019t have an opinion on who was wrong and who was right; you may have, and I\u2019m not going to argue with you either way. I\u2019m just saying the NBA should try \u2014 or, continue, if it\u2019s already tried \u2014 to make things right with this woman who still feels so obviously wronged. 3) Condolences to the family of longtime NBA assistant coach Don Newman, who died at age 60 last week after battling cancer. Newman worked in San Antonio, Milwaukee, New Jersey and Washington during his NBA career, which followed head coaching stints in college at Arizona State and Sacramento State. DNew was a good dude, and he will be missed. 4) Prayers for the Carolinas. Time, money, everything is needed.

The 41-year-old said he just couldn\u2019t see himself doing what it took to get ready for another season, though he had kept the door for potentially returning in 2018-19 slightly ajar after the Spurs were eliminated in the first round by Golden State. Ginobili says he has no specific plans on doing anything for a while, other than a family vacation to his native Argentina in December. Good for him. \u201cI think when you go through a process like this, you just find out that, if you want to get back to the player that you were, it takes a lot of effort.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  Denver Nuggets 2017-18 Record:  46-36, did not qualify for playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Michael Porter Jr. (Draft); Isaiah Thomas (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Wilson Chandler, Kenneth Faried, Darrell Arthur, Devin Harris The lowdown:  The Nuggets had to win their last seven games to reach the playoffs. They came up one short, losing on the final night of the season to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a heartbreaker that wasn\u2019t totally crushing. Last season was designed to find and develop potential stars for the future and, in that regard, the Nuggets were successful. Nikola Jokic was literally the center of their universe, leading the club in scoring, rebounding and assists as Denver ran its offense through the big man. Jamal Murray became a threat as well, improving across the board stats-wise from his rookie season while also emerging as a clutch scorer . Fellow guard Gary Harris made 39.6 percent of his 3-pointers and finished as the team\u2019s No. 2 scorer . That trio, all 23 or younger, made the season worthwhile and gave the Nuggets some bounce as the offseason began. As the talent-acquisition business gets tougher, finding impact players (for non-Warriors teams) usually means choosing high in the Draft, making a trade that works for you or finding luck in free agency. Another method is to find players who are suddenly devalued, get them on the cheap and hope their imperfections disappear. And on that note \u2026 welcome to the Nuggets\u2019 summer of 2018. They shouldn\u2019t have been in position to take Porter Jr. in the Draft or sign Thomas, but here they are. In a best-case scenario, these two players help elevate them into the Western Conference\u2019s upper crust and to a first-round playoff series win. And the worst case? There isn\u2019t any, since neither player came at a big cost. The risk-reward in both situations are in Denver\u2019s favor. Two years ago, Porter Jr. was among the best high school players in the country and Thomas finished fifth in Kia MVP voting . What were the odds the Nuggets would get both for the cost of a mid-first-round pick and some leftover salary cap space? Injuries set Porter Jr. and Thomas back and there\u2019s no guarantee either will make a complete recovery or recapture their place in the game. But the Nuggets are hopeful. Porter Jr. was the potential No. 1 overall pick several months before the Draft , but back woes essentially cost him his college career. Still, Porter was a strong top-10 pick candidate until the weeks prior to the Draft. When he tumbled all the way to No. 14, it was an easy call for the Nuggets. Yes, it\u2019s possible the 6-foot-10 forward may be restricted during training camp, if he participates at all. He had a second back surgery in July , which may disrupt or delay his rookie season. The Nuggets do know a healthy Porter Jr. could translate into the steal of the Draft, though. And even if it takes a while, remember, he\u2019s just 19 years old. Weeks after the Draft, the Nuggets grabbed another tarnished gem by inking Thomas to a reported one-year deal . Thomas is the victim of a basketball tragedy, someone who played his way into a big payday, only to suffer a cruel hip injury and watch his fortune go poof and career go sideways . It can\u2019t be understated how Thomas was once a fan favorite with the Boston Celtics, a little guy who enjoyed a dream season in 2016-17 and then had the misfortune of getting injured at the wrong time. That potential $25 million-a-year contract vanished, and two teams later, Thomas sat on the free-agent market, no doubt bitter and confused. He didn\u2019t ask for any of this, or deserve it. The Nuggets made it clear that Murray is the starting point guard and they won\u2019t hamper his growth, and Thomas said he\u2019s fine with that. The rest of the summer was all about financial housekeeping. Rich extensions were given to Jokic ( a reported five years, $146 million ) and Will Barton ( a reported four years, $54 million ). Keeping Jokic was a no-brainer, as he\u2019s just touching his prime and could soon become the best all-around center in the NBA. Barton was No. 9 in scoring off the bench last season while also improving his shot selection and 3-point accuracy over the past three seasons. Those signings pushed the Nuggets into luxury-tax land. To relieve that burden, they basically gave away three players from last year\u2019s rotation: Faried, Chandler and Arthur, and sacrificed a conditional 2019 first-round pick to make it happen. Since none of those players were in the future plans, the decision was easy. The Nuggets enter the season with Jokic, Murray, Barton, Harris, Paul Millsap, Mason Plumlee and Trey Lyles in the rotation. If Thomas and Porter Jr. contribute, those solid additions might keep the playoff suspense from lasting until the midnight hour.

Millennials. His name is Benjamin Cumbo, Jr., a man with a dream, in a city of dreams, Washington, D.C. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to play high school ball,\u201d Cumbo said Saturday morning. \u201cI wasn\u2019t good enough. Got cut from P.G. (Prince George\u2019s) Community College. But I just believed in myself, and said I could play pro. I always held my own with you guys; I just couldn\u2019t make it. And one day, playing down at Barry Farms (in D.C.), somebody saw me. Next thing you know, I\u2019m at a Division I Juco, and it started my pro career.\u201d Cumbo was in his native DMV over the weekend with more than 100 other ballers who were at the open tryout for the Capital City Go-Go , the expansion team that will begin play this fall as the Washington Wizards\u2019 G League affiliate and the 27th overall , as the NBA and G League inch ever closer to the one-to-one affiliation that has been a longtime goal. (Only the Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans and Denver Nuggets lack their own G League teams.)  Several franchises have figured out how to align their G League affiliates with their own vision, successfully developing their young players into key members of the parent club\u2019s rotations. Washington saw that first-hand in the playoffs last spring, when the Toronto Raptors\u2019 bench \u2014 filled with Draft picks that got meaningful minutes with Raptors 905 in 2016 and \u201817 \u2014 overwhelmed the Wizards at key moments . But the open tryout is a staple everywhere around the G League, the ultimate updated Walter Mitty story: pay a one-time fee \u2014 $150 here \u2014 and you\u2019ll get your shot. By rule, a G League team can only invite a maximum four players from these open tryouts to training camp. So the Wizards\u2019 staff, including President and General Manager Ernie Grunfeld and Senior Vice President of Basketball Operations Tommy Sheppard, joined the Go-Go staff, including first-year coach Jarell Christian , to have a look at the prospects, some of whom were there at 7 a.m. Saturday morning when the doors opened. Workouts went on both on the main court, and on each of the two practice courts in the back. Behind the courts lay the family lounge \u2014 replete with barber chairs, among the amenities most every NBA team now has in its practice facilities, the facilities themselves now part of the recruiting pitch for prospective free agents. Indeed, the entire building, off Alabama Avenue in Southeast D.C. , is a bet on a longshot. It is a part of the city that has, for so long, been left isolated, frankly, by the rest of us who live in town. It\u2019s still a big deal when a grocery store opens in this part of town; there\u2019s currently just the one in all of Ward 8, where the arena is located \u2014 a Giant Foods about a mile down the road . But the run has always been good here \u2014 mostly notably at the aforementioned Barry Farms, a now near-empty housing development which has the usual problems of a near-empty housing development , but has also served as the home of the Goodman League, the summer basketball tournament that has displayed just about every player of significance, college and pro, that ever laced up in the DMV.  Cumbo, Jr., grew up just over the D.C. line in Landover, Md. But he reps the city. And anything new rising up in Southeast gets noticed. The Go-Go, named after the iconic rhythmic sound that is quintessential D.C., can potentially provide connective tissue between a rich pro franchise and a community seeking believers in it. (I get that the arena itself will ultimately be named for whatever corporate sponsor pays the most money. And, that\u2019s fine. But the court has to be \u2014 has to be \u2014 called Chuck Brown Court, in honor of the late Godfather of Go-Go \u2014 whose \u201cBustin\u2019 Loose\u201d is the city\u2019s unofficial anthem . There\u2019s word a statue of Chuck will be outside the arena, and that\u2019s cool. The floor should still be his.) \u201cFor one, I believe, it gives hope to the youth that don\u2019t have that guidance that some people have,\u201d Cumbo, Jr., said. \u201cIt gives opportunity for those that can\u2019t afford that plane ticket to go to other tryouts in other states. It brings the NBA even closer to the youth, even older ones that\u2019s still trying to make it. It\u2019s like a glimmer of hope. Those who work out every day, three, four times a day, not working a job. But they believe, they believe, they believe.\u201d For now, let\u2019s suspend the cynical notion that a new building often is less about the building than about the land surrounding it. And that NBA arenas are often constructed these days as part of real estate deals, not to satisfy the needs of season ticket holders. And that the site of the former St. Elizabeth\u2019s mental hospital where the arena sits is one of the last undeveloped parcels of land this big remaining in the city. At its peak, \u201cSt. E\u2019s,\u201d as it was known in D.C., housed more than 7,000 patients , but by the beginning of the 21st century, almost all of its remaining patients had been sent elsewhere. (One of the last patients at St. Elizabeth\u2019s was John Hinckley, found not guilty by reason of insanity in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. He was released in 2016 .)  The Department of Homeland Security planned to put a massive footprint on St. E\u2019s west campus , but the project has run into significant delays and cost overruns . The \u201cSt. Elizabeth\u2019s East Entertainment and Sports Arena\u201d is on the other side of the campus. The arena seats more than 4,000 people and will be the basketball operations home of all of owner Ted Leonsis\u2019 teams \u2014 the Wizards, the Mystics and the Go-Go. The Wizards will still play downtown, along with the Stanley Cup-champion Washington Capitals, at Capital One Arena, but they will practice in Southeast starting with training camp in a couple of weeks. The Mystics and Go-Go will play and practice here. Putting the building in one of the least-served parts of the city could be, as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser says, \u201cbigger than basketball\u201d \u2014 if the building serves as an economic engine for this part of town as Capital One has done for downtown, and if Ward 8\/Southeast residents get a solid chunk of the better-paying, more permanent jobs associated with the arena. But it\u2019s a slippery slope. Gentrification has marched through D.C. as it has so many cities and so many who used to live here no longer can afford to do so. But, a dream is a powerful thing \u2014 even when the city is footing most of the bill for this $69 million building. This open tryout, like so many like it around the G League, wasn\u2019t really all that open. The Wizards already have their two players signed to two-way contracts for next season \u2014 guard Jordan McRae and forward Devin Robinson \u2014 and the Go-Go already has signed its Exhibit 10 players, including former 76ers and Knicks guard Chasson Randle . (A refresher: two-way players can bounce back between the G League and the NBA all season. But if the player is with the NBA team for 45 or more days, the player must either be sent down the G League team for the rest of the season or have his G League contract converted into a minimum NBA contract. Exhibit 10 players are players signed to G League contracts, which pay a minimum of $35,000 a year. But Exhibit 10 players can get bonuses from their G League teams for as much as an additional $50,000. The bonuses are in place to help keep players from bolting overseas for more lucrative deals. Exhibit 10 players can be invited to the parent club\u2019s training camp, but even if they\u2019re cut from the NBA team, they still get their $50,000 bonus if they stay on their G League team for at least 60 days.) But a dream is a powerful thing. Especially if it only costs a buck fifty to fulfill. \u201cLike I said to them when I addressed them, Jonathon Simmons was in the exact same situation as they were,\u201d said the Go-Go\u2019s first-year General Manager, Pops Mensah-Bonsu. He was referring to the now near-mythic tale of Simmons borrowing the $150 from his mother in 2013 to attend the Austin Toros\u2019 workout. Simmons parlayed that into a two-year stint in Austin with the Spurs\u2019 G League team, followed by a two-year guaranteed deal with the Spurs , followed by a three-year, $20 million deal with the Orlando Magic in free agency last summer . Cumbo still believes. He grew up in P.G. County, had some pickup runs, he says, with Kevin Durant, Ty Lawson and Quinn Cook. He\u2019s played in the Premier Basketball League and the newest incarnation of the American Basketball Association \u2014 think high school gyms, not Julius Erving and George Gervin. Now, he\u2019s a basketball skills trainer who wants to use this experience to better prepare his clients for the rigors of competing at the highest levels. \u201cThey saw I could pass, they saw I was vocal, they saw I could lead a team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to see if I could score off the pick, score off the screen, so I just showed them a little of that. Of course, some little fouls here and there and they didn\u2019t call it. But it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d We believe in fairy tales. We believe we\u2019re going to win the Lottery. We believe in the plucky underdog. But there\u2019s a reason almost all the tickets given out at the pari-mutuel window wind up on the race track floor. \u201cThere\u2019s some things in life called reality,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI know in some other tryouts, there has been the guy who showed up who was born in the \u201850s, and he had his Chuck Taylors on, and he was trying to just have one more go at it,\u201d Christian said. \u201cAnd I think those players kind of weed themselves (out) naturally. And I think by the end of it, if you\u2019re a realistic person, you kind of know what\u2019s going from here.\u201d Mensah-Bonsu was himself an NBA nomad , playing for five teams in four years before calling it quits as a player, but beginning his own rise up another ladder. After working for the National Basketball Players Association for a couple of years, he applied for the Go-Go job. He\u2019d played locally at George Washington University and was frequently at Capital One Arena for union business, anyway. He understood that, in a cruel turn disguised as a job requirement, he was now the one who would be snuffing out 99 percent of the dreams that were in full flower in the Go-Go\u2019s new arena. \u201cI think one of the reasons I did decide to retire early and get on this side of the game is that I\u2019ve been in similar situations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been cut from multiple NBA teams, and I\u2019ve been in situations where I thought I was good enough to make it. I was told, one way or another, that it wasn\u2019t meant to be. And those situations were painful. I told myself if I ever had the opportunity to be in a situation like this, to do this job with integrity, and always do this job to the point where I\u2019m honest, really, to the human side of things. And help guys out in that regard. Every single guy out here has a dream. Nobody\u2019s out here to waste their money to come out here to play pickup.\u201d  The majority of players playing Saturday were legit guys who\u2019d already played in the G League during the past couple of years, or played on scholarship. There was all-MAAC selection Austin Tilghman from Monmouth, and former Fairleigh Dickinson guard Darian Anderson , who\u2019d missed most of last season for the Knights with a foot injury. There were guys who\u2019d played the last couple of summers in The Basketball Tournament, and guys who\u2019ve been overseas hooping for a minute. There was, also, an afternoon, invitation-only tryout for players who didn\u2019t need to audition in the morning, which was slated to include players like former Lakers second-rounder Derrick Caracter and ex-Georgetown guard Austin Freeman . And there was Orion Palmer, a lanky wing from Riverside, Calif. He was one of two hearing impaired players who tried out Saturday. He played locally for two years at Gallaudet University, a celebrated school for the deaf, averaging 13.3 points and 6.9 rebounds as a senior in 2014 . But he\u2019s not ready to hang up the uni. He coaches at youth camps in Arizona and California while continuing to chase the dream. Among the things a deaf person who still want to hoop needs to do is to find an interpreter on the fly. Fortunately, Palmer was able to quickly a freelance ALS interpreter, Mia Engle. And though Engle said she knew next to nothing about basketball, she was able to translate \u201cfloppy\u201d and \u201cpick-and-pop\u201d with no difficulty. \u201cI love basketball so much,\u201d Palmer said through Engle. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun. And it\u2019s really my passion. Basketball is a unique sport, and it\u2019s a perfect fit for me \u2014 and also for a deaf person, as a player.\u201d On the floor, Palmer needed no translator. The language of basketball doesn\u2019t have an accent, or colloquialisms. The rhythm of the game speaks to those who play it, and who want to keep doing so. They don\u2019t care about the odds, or the numbers, or the reality that 99 percent of them will get nothing more out of their day on what should be Chuck Brown Court than a t-shirt. The dream is a powerful thing. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The 12-time All-Star delivered the news in a YouTube video titled \u201cOne Last Dance\u2026\u201d that was published Sunday. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s right to ask you guys to join me for one last dance, for one last season,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThis is it. I\u2019ve given this game everything that I have, and I\u2019m happy about that. I\u2019m going to give it for one last season, everything else I have left.\u201d During the 10-minute video, Wade went into detail about the factors that played into the decision and how his life\u2019s journey built up to what will be his final NBA season. His mentioned his family frequently, and thanked both them and his fans profusely. \u201cI feel like my family has put me first for so many years, for good reasons,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut I feel like there comes a point in time where we all got to think about someone else, especially the ones around you that have supported you, supported your dream, supported your journey like my family has.\u201d Wade was emotionally forthcoming about the toll of losing Chicago native and former agent Henry Thomas to a neuromuscular disease in January. \u201cWith him not being there last year, that was it,\u201d Wade admitted. \u201cI lost something in this game. Me getting traded back to Miami, it helped, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The former fifth overall pick, however, cited his love of the game and the journey it has given him. \u201cThis decision is bigger than the game of basketball,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThis decision don\u2019t have nothing to do with the talent in my body.\u201d Last season, Wade averaged 16.3 points on 44.3 percent shooting in the Heat\u2019s first-round playoff elimination by the Philadelphia 76ers , scoring 28 points in Game 2 and 25 in Game 4. Shortly after being traded to the Heat, Wade told ESPN in an interview that he wanted to be with the Heat \u2018forever\u2019 and that he did not want a Kobe Bryant-like farewell season . It was an encouraging finish individually, after Wade had averaged 12.0 points with 40.9 percent accuracy in the 21 games he played after being dealt from Cleveland at the February trade deadline .

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Miami Heat 2017-18 Record:  44-38, lost in first round to Philadelphia 76ers Who\u2019s new:  None significant Who\u2019s gone:  None significant The lowdown: The search for an identity and prosperity in the post-Big Three era continued for the Heat with mixed results. They did reach the playoffs and yet clearly have fallen far from the Eastern Conference elite, having been scrubbed clean of franchise players. Goran Dragic was their leading scorer and an All-Star at 17.3 points per game in his best overall season in Miami. A disappointment, though, was center Hassan Whiteside, who bristled at his reduced role and being benched in fourth quarters. Although his numbers were respectable ( 14 ppg, 11.4 rpg ) he was hardly the impact player Miami wanted when it gave him $25 million a season. Injuries limited Dion Waiters to 30 games and others on the roster struggled to fill his scoring load. An emotional boost arrived at midseason when favorite son Dwyane Wade returned via trade . He played 21 games and often provided flashbacks from his glorious past. In the end, however, the Heat were merely good enough to grab one of the last few playoff berths, a stark difference from when they ruled the East and played for titles. When you don\u2019t have a Draft pick for the second time in three years and are too strapped for cash to get a seat at the free-agent table, you get the kind of summer Miami had: Relaxing and quiet \u2026 maybe too much so. Acquring Dragic from the Phoenix Suns four years ago involved those Draft picks and stole a piece of Miami\u2019s future. That left the Heat scrambling for crumbs from the undrafted player pile and hoping to find a free agent on the cheap. The Heat are also paying the price for team president Pat Riley\u2019s spending spree in recent summers to keep players like Whiteside, Waiters, James Johnson, Josh Richardson and Tyler Johnson. The most curious of the bunch is Tyler Johnson\u2019s contract, which doesn\u2019t expire until after the 2019-20 season. Because of a balloon structure, Johnson receives nearly a combined $40 million this season and next, which is great for him but not so good for Miami\u2019s cap flexibility. At least the Heat had enough to bring back Wayne Ellington on a one-year deal . Ellington had a career season from deep (39.2 percent) and was one of the better 3-point shooters in the league . There was some fear in Miami that Ellington would price himself beyond the Heat\u2019s reach, but Miami was helped by a mild free-agent market. That kept Ellington from locking down a rich, multiyear extension. Besides, he preferred to return to Miami, where he can keep his stock high for next summer. The Heat also missed out on adding Carmelo Anthony, who became available after being traded by Oklahoma City Thunder and released by the Atlanta Hawks . Although he strongly considered Miami, Anthony obviously wanted to be with a title contender more than a spot on South Beach and signed with the Houston Rockets instead . Miami\u2019s small forward spot seems crowded with Richardson and Justise Winslow chopping up the minutes. Plus, Winslow \u2014 who is extension-eligible next summer \u2014 faces a key season in 2018-19. The main task this summer for the Heat was getting on the same page with Whiteside. Their relationship seemed headed for a split as the summer began. Whiteside fumed over his role in the rotation and especially his reduced minutes in the fourth quarters . Coach Erik Spoelstra increasingly kept Whiteside benched during tight games and Whiteside no longer was a first or second option on offense. No doubt, the Heat at least weighed the possibility of trading Whiteside. But at an average of $25 million the next two seasons, his contract proved tough to move. In these situations, such contracts only fetch another bad contract in return, or require the team to sweeten the deal with a first-round pick. Miami was willing to do neither. Instead, the two sides talked it out and reached an understanding. Of course, it\u2019s easy to call a truce in the offseason. The truth will reveal itself when Whiteside finds himself in (or out of) the final five minutes of a close game. Whiteside may become a bit more attractive to other teams at the trade deadline as he closes in on the end of that contract. It\u2019s an interesting and delicate time for the Heat, who are still searching for an identity after the departure of LeBron James. Chris Bosh isn\u2019t walking through that door and Wade\u2019s upcoming season, his 16th in the NBA, will be his last . In the meantime, whose team is it? With abundant sunshine, no state tax, Spoelstra, the charms of South Beach and Riley\u2019s steady leadership, the Heat will always be in play for A-list free agents. Yet the state of this team is handcuffed to a batch of decent-but-not-great players who are sucking up cap space. Relief and major change is perhaps two years away. Will Riley, who turns 74 in March, still be in control then?

Ginobili had put himself through those same workouts for 16 seasons. But this August morning, the 41-year-old realized he couldn\u2019t. For a player who has literally thrown himself into his basketball career, the realization his body and spirit were no longer willing cemented the decision to walk away from the NBA. \u201dI couldn\u2019t see my body going through that kind of grind again,\u201d Ginobili said Saturday during a press conference at the Spurs practice facility. \u201dI felt that I had a good season, that I left everything that I had in the previous season both physically and mentally.\u201d Ginobili was thoughtful, self-effacing and funny in his first interview since announcing his retirement Aug. 27 on social media. He steps away after helping San Antonio win four of its five NBA titles, the last coming in 2014. His retirement, along with Tony Parker\u2019s departure to the Charlotte Hornets as a free agent, brings an end to the era of the Spurs\u2019 Big Three. Along with Tim Duncan, Ginobili and Parker helped San Antonio become the most successful franchise in any sport based on winning percentage. The Spurs also will be without Kawhi Leonard, who requested a trade and was dealt to Toronto along with Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl. It will be the first time coach Gregg Popovich enters a season without one of the Big Three by his side. \u201dI think it\u2019s going to be a great challenge for him having a different kind of team, maybe less corporate knowledge,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201dI think it\u2019s going to be a fun challenge. I think he\u2019s going to do good.\u201d The Argentina native was twice selected to the All-Star team and twice named to the All-NBA third team despite spending most of his career coming off the bench. He was named the 2008 NBA Sixth Man of the Year. \u201dPlaying 16 years is completely unexpected and going through everything we went through,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201dBig disappointments, huge wins, creating that type of union with the coaching staff, with the front office, with the staff, teammates . it\u2019s been an amazing journey, way beyond anything that can be expected.\u201d Ginobili played professionally in Argentina and Europe for seven seasons before joining the Spurs in 2002 following his selection with the 57th pick in 1999. He entered the NBA as a mop-topped 25-year-old who could make a spectacular pass one minute and then throw the ball into the stands the next. Ginobili\u2019s dynamic, if erratic, plays endeared him to fans but caused consternation for Popovich. But his coach grew to love and accept Ginobili\u2019s unique abilities. \u201dAs time went along, I learned to not speak if I thought a shot was contested or if there was a defensive play he wanted to make to get a steal because he does things that win games,\u201d Popovich said. \u201dSo, it taught me to watch a little more and not be so micromanagement like.\u201d His willingness to put team first also endeared him to Popovich and the fans. Despite averaging 13.3 points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 assists in his career, Ginobili only started 349 of 1,057 career games. Accepting a role off the bench was difficult for a player as competitive as Ginobili, especially since his goal was to be an NBA starter. \u201dNever did (achieve that),\u201d Ginobili said, laughing. \u201dI actually achieved it in my game two or game three. I said \u2018Yes,\u2019 then boom, back to the depths of the bench. At the beginning it was kind of hard. It took me a while to understand it, to get my ego out of the middle between Pop and me, or the game and me, and how that had to be done for the team and me.\u201d Coming off the bench only cemented Ginobili\u2019s legacy. His selflessness, along with a Eurostep drive to the basket he helped popularize, will surely lead to a place in the Hall of Fame. In addition to his NBA success, Ginobili won a championship in the Euroleague and Italian league and led Argentina to gold in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Ginobili reflected on all that success and all those memories last season, knowing it would be his last. Although he \u201dleft the door open\u201d for a possible return this season, Ginobili said nothing changed his mind. \u201dEven though I was, I am very sure about the decision, it\u2019s still awkward,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201dIt\u2019s still tough. You are convinced, you talk to your wife, you know what you\u2019ve got to do. But my finger shaked a lot before hitting that enter (to announce his retirement).

With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Milwaukee Bucks 2017-18 Record :  44-38; lost in first round to Boston Celtics Who\u2019s new:  Coach Mike Budenholzer, Donte DiVincenzo (Draft), Ersan Ilyasova (free agency), Brook Lopez (free agency), Pat Connaughton (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Jabari Parker, Jason Terry The lowdown:  Last season was the coronation of a star as Giannis Antetokounmpo generated Kia MVP chatter and showed the multiple skills that should make him a force in the NBA for years to come. Giannis led the Bucks in scoring (helped by improved outside shooting) and rebounding and was second in assists and steals. He flourished in the open court but his half-court play was noticeably better as well. Along with Khris Middleton, the Bucks had a solid two-man tandem and they were aided by Eric Bledsoe, who arrived by trade midseason and assumed the starting point guard spot. Depth was an issue at times because of injuries to guards Malcolm Brogdon and Matthew Dellavedova; Parker was inconsistent while Tony Snell and John Henson rarely impacted games. Yet the Bucks, months after firing Jason Kidd and using Joe Prunty as the interim coach, pushed the Celtics to the limit in the first round and went into the offseason feeling frisky. When Kidd arrived three years ago from the Brooklyn Nets, he was projected as a long-term solution at coach and a mentor for Giannis. But after firing Kidd midseason due to a lack of progress, the Bucks found themselves back at square one regarding the coaching spot. Since Prunty wasn\u2019t the answer either, now comes Budenholzer, who had a solid run in Atlanta that included winning the 2014-15 Coach of the Year award. The Hawks granted Budenholzer permission to interview for other positions this summer when he made it clear he was not interested in guiding their long-term rebuilding plan. With the blessing of their superstar, the Bucks hired Budenholzer and now, including Prunty, Giannis is on his fourth coach in five years. That\u2019s not a great situation for a young franchise player, which means the Bucks need the instability to end with Budenholzer. And his longevity depends on his system and how it maximizes Giannis\u2019 talents while incorporating the skills of a supporting cast that remains full of question marks. Or to put it another way: Is this the Cleveland Cavaliers and LeBron James, Part I all over again? Remember, the Cavs\u2019 failure to give help to LeBron caused him to lose confidence in the organization and take his talents to Miami. If the Bucks improved themselves on paper this offseason, it was perhaps marginally so; they essentially swapped Parker for Ilyasova at forward and brought in Lopez to solidify their frontcourt depth. Parker was a tough call for Milwaukee as a restricted free agent. He endured a pair of knee surgeries and made a courageous return to mixed reviews last season. They chose not to match the two-year, $40 million offer sheet given by the Bulls and wished him well. The Bucks instead gave three years and $21 million to Ilyasova, who spent the first seven years of his career in Milwaukee. The Bucks figured Ilyasova ( 10.9 points, 5.9 rebounds last season ) would prove to be a better fit alongside Giannis because of his ability to stretch the floor and crash the boards. Three years ago Lopez was a very functional big man who averaged nearly 20 points and brought a soft shooting touch with range. Now he\u2019s someone who only fetched one year and $3.4 million in free agency after two seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers. There\u2019s a good chance Lopez could get a second wind in Budenholzer\u2019s system, which allowed Al Horford to stretch the floor in Atlanta to solid results. As long as the Bucks don\u2019t expect Lopez to rebound, he should be a decent compliment to Henson, Ilyasova and Thon Maker. In the draft the Bucks went for DiVincenzo, who was named the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA tournament after dropping 31 points in the championship game. He was the most important player on the floor for Villanova in the Final Four and suddenly found himself on radar for the NBA draft despite starting only 12 games in his college career. He has good size at 6-foot-5 and took charge for \u2018Nova when it mattered most. He\u2019s a bit of a gamble if only because, with the exception of the Final Four, he was rarely the focal point in college. But at No. 17 in the draft he could prove to be good value and a player to be developed for the future. The Bucks are one of a handful of teams that must draft wisely and have a slim margin for error in trades because Milwaukee isn\u2019t a destination spot for A-list free agents. That\u2019s the challenge for the Bucks during the prime years of Giannis. With no blockbuster deals or high lottery picks this summer, the Bucks will mostly look to improve from within \u2014 without Parker, a former No. 2 overall pick who was once considered a keeper.

According to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania (via Twitter), the Knicks and Noah are expected to part ways with each other before the start of training camp. Here\u2019s more from Charania ( via Twitter ): Last month, reports had circulated the Knicks and Noah had planned to part ways and this latest news appears to carry on that case. In early February, the Knicks announced that they and Noah had reached a mutual agreement for Noah to take an indefinite leave of absence from the team . At that point, Noah had not been around the team since Jan. 25. Since missing that Jan. 25 game, Noah missed the Knicks\u2019 next four games as well. According to multiple reports at the time, Noah was away from the team because of a reported disagreement with then-Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek. Hornacek was fired at season\u2019s end and replaced by Fizdale . Noah signed with the Knicks in the summer of 2016 hoping that he could make an impact on New York\u2019s defense and front line. Since signing with New York, though, Noah has played in 53 games (starting 46 of them) and has lost time to various injuries. He had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last February and shoulder surgery last April . In March of 2017, he was suspended 20 games by the NBA for violating the league\u2019s anti-drug policy . That suspension cost him the first 12 games of the 2017-18 season. In 2016-17, Noah averaged five points and 8.8 rebounds per game in 26 minutes per game. Last season, he averaged 1.7 points, 2 rebounds and 5.7 minutes per game in seven games.

Perhaps a run at the Kia Sixth Man of the Year award will be in Nowitzki\u2019s sights next season as he closes in on the twilight of his career ? The Mavs\u2019 offseason addition of free-agent center DeAndre Jordan should bump Nowitzki from the starting center spot he played in some lineups for Dallas over the last few seasons. In his 20 seasons with the Mavs, Nowitzki has started 1,440 of the 1,471 career games he has played with Dallas. As youngsters like Dennis Smith Jr., Harrison Barnes and rookie Luka Doncic fill into the rotation in 2018-19, Nowitzki told reporters yesterday he is open to a reserve role if that is what will help Dallas most. Eddie Sefko of The Dallas Morning News has more on how Nowitzki may fit into the Mavs\u2019 various lineups : Coach Rick Carlisle has been opposed to bringing Nowitzki off the bench for years, even though the Mavs\u2019 star was open to the idea in early 2017 . But, Sefko notes that all that matters to Carlisle this season is winning games. Nowitzki recently participated in his first scrimmages with the team since undergoing minor surgery on his left ankle in the offseason. He told reporters on Thursday that he had some mixed results as he works himself back into form. The Mavs re-signed the 13-time All-Star Nowitzki this summer after they declined a team option on his contract at the start of free agency to create more salary cap room to add Jordan. The 40-year-old forward averaged 12.0 points (on 40.9 percent shooting from 3-point), 5.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists during 77 games this season \u2014 his 20th in the NBA. The 12-time All-Star sits 232 points behind Wilt Chamberlain for No. 5 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list . Nowitzki is set to become the first player in NBA history to play 21 consecutive seasons for the same franchise. The 7-foot German is one of six players overall, and the only international player, with more than 30,000 career points.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  Washington Wizards 2017-18 Record:  43-39, lost in first round to Toronto Raptors Who\u2019s new:  Dwight Howard (free agency), Jeff Green (free agency), Troy Brown, Jr. (Draft), Austin Rivers (trade) Who\u2019s gone:  Marcin Gortat (trade), Mike Scott (free agency) The lowdown:  With John Wall limited to half a season because of knee surgery , Bradley Beal became a leading man and, on some nights, pushed the boundaries of stardom. If anything, he gave the Wizards confidence in knowing that, when the pair is healthy, Washington boasts a top-three-or-four backcourt in the NBA. Forward Otto Porter Jr. was third in the NBA in 3-point shooting ( a blistering 44.1 percent ) and served as a secondary source of scoring. However, the Wizards weren\u2019t so clear-cut elsewhere. The frontline continued to be a source of mixed results and frustration and, other than Kelly Oubre Jr., depth was an issue. The Wizards went chilly late in the season, lost nine of their last 12 games and dropped to the eighth seed. In some ways, the Wizards are on the clock. They must seize the opportunity to win big while Wall, 27, and Beal, 25, are still in their primes. Yet they\u2019ve rarely stayed healthy together and besides, nothing is promised. Remember, the Toronto Raptors broke up the sterling DeMar DeRozan-Kyle Lowry backcourt this summer when their patience finally ran out. Also, keep in mind the cost. Wall\u2019s super max deal doesn\u2019t begin until 2019-20. Beal is due $80 million the next three years, roughly the same money Washington will pay Porter Jr., who\u2019s a good (but perhaps overpriced) complimentary player. For the time being, the Wizards will put their frontcourt faith in Dwight Howard, who arrives about five years past his prime , but should be an upgrade over Gortat. Howard, 32, came cheap after his Brooklyn Nets buyout and remains a deluxe rebounder (12.5 per game last season). The decision to bring in Howard could be the banana peel in the path of progress, however. This is his fourth team in four years. His \u201cact\u201d \u2014 being easy-going, goofy and fun-loving \u2014 didn\u2019t play well with some previous teammates, including, among others, Kobe Bryant and James Harden. Howard is headed to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and anyone who believes otherwise is foolish \u2014 the man did carry the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA Finals . For a seven-year stretch, he was one of the game\u2019s biggest impact players. Yet his twilight is bewildering, which is not surprising. Howard never developed his offensive game (namely a go-to move or mid-range shot) and as a result, he\u2019s a dinosaur in a changing environment, someone who shrinks considerably when he strays six feet from the basket. Plus, he\u2019s not the defensive demon of before, although he stays in tremendous physical shape and still runs the floor. There\u2019s also the matter of his personality, which might be overstated to a degree, yet was an issue ever since he left the Magic. Howard appears to be on a mission to please everyone and in the process, tends to ruffle some feathers along the way. Finally, he often becomes irritated when he doesn\u2019t see the ball in the low post. He won\u2019t get many touches on a team with Wall and Beal taking upwards of 35 shots a night. (Ball movement and sharing was a complaint Gortat voiced at times in the past, too.) Over the summer, Wall said he will do whatever he can to make Howard comfortable \u2026 because what\u2019s the alternative? Since Beal joined Wall in 2012-13, they have won three playoff series together \u2014 but have never reached the East finals. However, the East is wide open this year with LeBron James out West. The Wizards chose not to trade Oubre Jr. in the offseason, but this situation bears watching. He\u2019s a developing player at a stacked position, and the swingman spot became even more crowded when the Wizards drafted Brown, who\u2019s cut in the same mold. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the Wizards move Oubre Jr. or Porter Jr. by the trade deadline if the right deal comes along, simply because Washington can\u2019t pay both. Plus, Oubre Jr. is eligible for a contract extension next summer. Brown, 19, brings court vision and a reliable handle, but it\u2019s hard to see him playing much given the bodies in front of him on the depth chart. After all the quality big men and point guards were gone (and they passed on picking Michael Porter Jr.), Washington was in a weird position at No. 15 in the Draft. They could either trade the pick or Draft a wing-type. They traded Gortat for Rivers, who\u2019s listed at point guard but lacks the court vision and ability to create for others to see much time at the position. Rivers is more of a 3-point shooter, and he did well enough (37.8 percent) last season to ably bring that element off the bench. For the most part, the Wizards made minor moves this summer, none of which are expected to dramatically change the complexion of the club. It should be enough to keep them in the playoff mix, especially with LeBron gone. From there, their hopes will be tied to their health.

Police Chief Alfonso Morales said the firing decision was not tied to anything Erik Andrade did when Brown was arrested, but explained that the social media posts compromised the officer\u2019s ability to testify in other cases. Morales spoke about the case at a Marquette University event. Brown sued the police department in June and accused officers of using excessive force and targeting him because he\u2019s black. A group of officers swarmed on him at a Walgreens parking lot because he didn\u2019t immediately remove his hands from his pockets. Brown was standing with the officers waiting for a citation for parking in a disabled spot early on Jan. 26, but never appeared to threaten police before or during his arrest, according to police body camera videos. Andrade later mocked Brown on Facebook for his arrest. \u201cNice meeting Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks at work this morning! Lol#FearTheDeer,\u201d one Facebook post read, referencing a slogan used to cheer on the Bucks at games. Andrade also posted a racist meme of Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant. Morales said in a statement that Andrade\u2019s posts violate the department\u2019s social media policies. \u201cThey have a racist connotation and are derogatory, mocking an individual who was recently the subject of officers\u2019 use of force,\u201d Morales said. \u201cSuch comments also directly affect his credibility and ability to testify in future hearings as a member of this Department. I have not, and will not, tolerate such behavior.\u201d Andrade was at the scene when Brown was arrested but was not among the officers who took him down, according to police. A total of 11 officers involved in the arrest were disciplined or retrained, but Andrade was not among those punished at the time. The president of the Milwaukee Police Association, Mike Crivello, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on behalf of Andrade. Andrade does not have a listed phone number. Morales apologized to Brown for his officers\u2019 actions and the Bucks\u2019 second-year guard was never charged with anything."},{"id":38731,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-luol-deng","date":"2018-09-13","title":"With addition of Luol Deng, Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau shuts off noise","content":" CHICAGO \u2013 Media folks and NBA fans in Chicago and Minnesota have had some fun with it lately, but when the term \u201cTimberBulls\u201d was dropped on coach Tom Thibodeau, he didn\u2019t smile. Not even a little. \u201cPeople are always going to talk about different things,\u201d Thibodeau said during a break at the annual coaches meeting organized by the National Basketball Coaches Association. \u201cBut these aren\u2019t decisions that are just made on a whim.\u201d Along with most of his peers, Thibodeau, who actually coaches the Timberwolves , was in town for a series of sessions Wednesday and Thursday with league executives, referees and representatives of the broadcast partners. His week had begun with the news that Minnesota had signed veteran forward Luol Deng , though, a move that brings to four the number of Wolves Thibodeau coached during his five seasons in Chicago: Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose and Deng. Hence the snarkily coined \u201cTimberBulls.\u201d \u201cBut to me, you look at the players who are available and you ask, \u2018Can they make the team better?\u2019\u201d said Thibodeau, who is also the team\u2019s president of basketball operations . \u201cFrom Glen Taylor, the owner, to [GM] Scott Layden, we talk things over. If we feel we can improve the team, we\u2019re gonna do so. Particularly in a case like Luol, that\u2019s why we [kept a roster spot open].\u201d Deng, 33, played the first 9 \u00bd seasons of his career with the Bulls, the final 3 \u00bd under Thibodeau. While they were together, the two-way forward earned an all-Defensive selection in 2012 and All-Star invitations in 2012 and 2013 . He also led the NBA in average minutes played those two seasons, 39.4 and 38.7 , a workload that many feel led to a series of injuries. Deng was traded in January 2014 to Miami, had his playing time shaved by about five minutes nightly and, over 146 games, put up numbers on a 36-minute basis (14.3 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 34.9 3-point percentage) close to his averages with the Bulls. Two summers ago, in the frenzy of 2016 free agency, Deng landed a four-year, $72 million contract from the Los Angeles Lakers. But he was out of sync with the timeline of a rebuilding team. After averaging 7.6 points in 26.5 minutes in just 56 games in his first season in L.A., Deng played 13 minutes on 2017-18 Opening Night against the Clippers \u2013 then was held out of the remaining 81 games completely. It\u2019s an unusual situation: A player who deal with a variety of alleged overuse injuries, now coping with questions related to underuse. A friend of Deng\u2019s told NBA.com this week that the 6-foot-8 product of Duke was healthy all of last season and, in fact, picked up the pace of his individual workouts while improving his nutrition and hiring a personal chef. \u201cHe\u2019s always been [in shape],\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cThe nutrition part is what, I think, he added on. A lot of players are doing that and a lot of teams as well, where you have chefs in the practice facilities. He\u2019s always been great in his commitment to train, be in shape. He\u2019s always put a lot into recovery. \u201cI look back at this time in Chicago, he had a great impact on Jimmy when Jimmy was a rookie. He would come in every night to work on his body and to shoot, and he would bring Jimmy in with him. Those things go a long way.\u201d  Deng was available because the Lakers chose to waive and, per a provision in salary-cap rules, \u201cstretch\u201d his remaining salary across multiple seasons to lessen the short-term hit. That frees up money for a management team led by Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka, who succeeded Mitch Kupchak and Jim Buss after Deng already had been signed. During his time with Thibodeau, Deng\u2019s success was offset by the appearance that the coach\u2019s heavy reliance on him as a two-way player was wearing \u2013 and breaking \u2013 him down. But over the past two seasons combined, he has logged just 1,499 minutes, fewer than in any of his first 12 NBA seasons and only half what he played in two of them. Some would argue that a professional athlete north of 30 years old needs to play to maintain his skills, timing, stamina and more. In other words, use it or lose it. Others counter that Deng should be refreshed by a sabbatical from the NBA\u2019s wear and tear. His low-involvement Lakers stay, they\u2019ll contend, has left tread on his tires. Thibodeau\u2019s take on the matter? \u201cHe\u2019s only 33,\u201d the Wolves coach said. \u201cHe takes great care of himself. He knows how to prepare for the season. For us, the fact that he can play [multiple spots] and he\u2019s a veteran, it\u2019s a long season, you like to have players like that. And he\u2019s familiar with what we want to do.\u201d Familiarity. That\u2019s the quality Thibodeau sees in his former Bulls players, snarky nickname or not. Deng, Butler, Rose and Gibson have played a total of 1,308 games for Thibodeau, in regular season and playoffs, with Chicago and\/or Minnesota. The ballrooms used for meetings this week in a downtown Chicago luxury hotel were filled with guys who understand the value in coaching players who know their system, players they can trust. \u201cYou\u2019re familiar with them. they\u2019re familiar with you,\u201d Thibodeau told NBA.com. \u201cI\u2019m not the only person who has ever coached Luol, coached Derrick, coached Jimmy or coached Taj. All four of those guys have had other suitors. You talk to \u2018em and tell \u2018em how they\u2019ll fit in, and then they have to make a decision as to whether they want to come or not. \u201cI think all four of those guys have added a lot to our teams. So whether a guy has played for me before or in a system where Scott had been before or maybe where one of our assistants had been, if you feel like you know a player well and he fits into your system, then why not do it? \u201cTo me, I don\u2019t really care what other people think. I care about what we think.\u201d OK, so Thibodeau understands, then, why the Joakim Noah jokes already have begun, anticipating the day the New York Knicks trade, buy out or \u201cstretch\u201d the two-time All-Star center. Noah \u2013 reportedly not drawing interest from Minnesota, per Marc Stein of the New York Times Wednesday \u2013 also was highly productive, heavily used and often injured in five seasons with Thibodeau as a Bull. This time Thibodeau did smile, saying only, \u201cWe\u2019re all interested in good players.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Bird, 24, was held on $50,000 bail after not-guilty pleas to domestic violence-related charges were entered on his behalf. Police spoke with Bird\u2019s girlfriend, a student at a local college, at a city hospital after his arrest last Friday, prosecutor Khyati Short said during the hearing. Bird choked the woman unconscious, threw her against the wall and dragged her by the ankles when she tried to leave his apartment in the city\u2019s Brighton neighborhood, police said. The ordeal, sparked by what the woman called \u201ctrust issues,\u201d went on for several hours, she said, until Bird experienced \u201cseizure-like\u201d symptoms and fell. That\u2019s when the woman left. Bird spent several days in a hospital. Bird says in a statement issued Thursday that he\u2019s \u201ctaking some time away from the team as I deal with my legal and medical issues.\u201d He is apologizing to his family, the Celtics, his teammates, fans and the NBA \u201cfor the unnecessary distraction that I have caused.\u201d Bird says he doesn\u2019t condone violence against women and hopes eventually to regain the public\u2019s trust. Bird\u2019s lawyer, former federal prosecutor Brian Kelly, said that his client \u201cunderstands the seriousness of the allegations\u201d but that there are two sides to the story. The Celtics called the allegations disturbing and said the team\u2019s \u201cthoughts are with the victim.\u201d \u201cThe Celtics organization deplores domestic violence of any kind, and we are deeply disturbed by the allegations against Jabari Bird,\u201d the team said in a statement. The team notes that domestic violence issues are handled by the NBA\u2019s main office. Bird, a second-round draft choice of the Celtics in 2017 out of California, signed a two-year contract with the team this summer after splitting his rookie season between Boston and the Maine Red Claws of the G-League.

When that game tips off on Oct. 16, Celtics forward Gordon Hayward plans to be on the court for it. Hayward met with the media in Boston today at the Auerbach Center at New Balance World Headquarters to discuss how he\u2019s faring in his injury rehab work. He suffered a gruesome,season-ending ankle and tibia injury just five minutes into the Celtics\u2019 first game last season, but has been hard at work to get ready for the start of the 2018-19 season. \u201cI expect to be out there,\u201d Hayward said Thursday. \u201cI would say I\u2019m basically 100 percent. There are certain things that I think are going to take time. Even if I was 100 percent healthy, I\u2019m not 100 percent basketball-wise, just because I haven\u2019t played in a year. I\u2019m trying to figure those things out.\u201d Hayward said he has celebrated each bit of progress \u2014 the walking boot coming off, or shooting baskets standing up, instead of sitting in a chair. Within the past two weeks, he has been able to play five-on-five basketball. \u201cWith each step I get some joy,\u201d said Hayward, who then slipped into his Celtics uniform and took part in a photoshoot. Now, he said, he is ready to get back in the green for real. \u201cThe hardest part of the whole process has been the mental challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you find the fight within yourself.\u201d Hayward said he\u2019s still working to get fully back into game shape and that getting his full explosiveness back remains one of the last things he must overcome before the season begins. That all said, Hayward said he has played 5-on-5 for the last two weeks with no restrictions. \u201cThere\u2019s certain things that are going to take time. I\u2019m not 100 percent basketball-wise because I haven\u2019t played in a year,\u201d he said. Hayward has documented his injury rehab process and workouts via social media and said earlier this summer on his web site that he hoped to be participating in full-court, 5-on-5 workouts by late July . Overall, Boston suffered minimal offseason roster losses among its key rotation players as only center Greg Monroe ( who signed with Toronto ) and guard Shane Larkin ( who will be playing in Turkey ) won\u2019t be back for 2018-19. \u201cWatching the guys last year just gave me a lot of confidence in our team and what I think we have the ability to do \u2026 We have a lot of depth and it\u2019s going to be a fun year,\u201d Hayward said Thursday. A week ago, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he is counting on having a fully healthy roster once the Celtics open training camp on Sept. 24. Aside from losing Hayward for essentially the entire 2017-18 season, star guard Kyrie Irving missed the final 15 games of the 2017-18 season and the entire playoffs to repair his left knee. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that everybody is going to be ready to go,\u201d Stevens said in early September. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a great opportunity to start afresh with a brand new team, though we do have a lot of guys back, and see if we can be the best version of ourselves.\u201d Hayward told reporters he is overall happy to be back in the mix with his Boston teammates and is looking forward to the forthcoming season. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun being able to play again, and play with my teammates,\u201d Hayward said Thursday. \u201cUsing these past two weeks and the next month or so will be good to kind of get back into the game, feel the rhythm, the timing, different things like that, but it feels pretty good.\u201d Despite the loss of their starting backcourt, the Celtics still advanced to the Eastern Conference finals , falling to the Cavaliers in seven games. Given that LeBron James is now out of the East \u2014 he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, meaning his eight-year run of being on the team that wins the East is ending \u2014 Boston figures to be a popular pick to reach the NBA Finals next season.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  LA Clippers 2017-18 Record:  42-40, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Draft), Jerome Robinson (Draft), Marcin Gortat (trade), Luc Mbah a Moute (free agency), Mike Scott (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  DeAndre Jordan (free agency), Austin Rivers (trade) The lowdown:  The seismic mid-season trade that jettisoned All-Star forward Blake Griffin all but ended the \u201cLob City\u201d era and sent the Clippers on an unknown journey toward a new identity. Surprisingly, they didn\u2019t completely crumble after losing Griffin and Chris Paul in a span of seven months, and that\u2019s a credit to coach Doc Rivers, who received a vote of confidence by the new management team. Lou Williams, the reigning Kia Sixth Man Award winner , had a massive season in leading the Clippers in scoring (22.6 points per game) and assists (5.4 apg) . He did that while earning a contract extension in-season , sparing himself (and the Clippers) from hitting the free-agent market in 2018 . Still, the Clippers failed to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2010-11 and entered the offseason with the stigma again being the No. 2 NBA team in Los Angeles after owning basketball bragging rights in town for four years. DeAndre Jordan the title of \u201cMr. Clipper\u201d \u2014 which was either a badge of honor or a badge of courage, depending on your view of the franchise and its prickly history. Regardless, he could always be counted upon by the Clippers, playing in more games than anyone in club history . He experienced the many lows and the few but savory highs and then, he was gone. Quite fittingly, he was the last of the CP3-Griffin-Jordan Clippers to leave, bouncing out a door that was held open by the Clippers this summer. Officially, Jordan signed with the Mavericks through free agency . He could\u2019ve opted into the final year of his contract and stayed in LA but the Clippers really didn\u2019t give him much choice. He wasn\u2019t getting a contract extension, which means the club essentially told him it was time to move on. Rivers was stripped of his personnel powers before last season, and since then the Clippers began changing. During their six-year run of winning records in the regular season, they never reached the West finals under Rivers \u2014 a reflection of crummy luck with untimely injuries and Rivers\u2019 failure to garnish the rotation with key role players. It also didn\u2019t help that Golden State amped up and began its dynasty during this time (remember: the Clippers were the last West team to eliminate the Warriors from the playoffs ). Overall, from a bottom line standpoint, \u201cLob City\u201d came up short. The evidence said the Clippers had gone as far as possible with Griffin, Paul and Jordan, and keeping them around would be expensive and ultimately fruitless. So they didn\u2019t pay Paul two summers ago. They paid Griffin , but then dumped him once they found a desperate buyer in Detroit. And they refused to extend Jordan, who opted out and signed with Dallas once the Mavericks agreed to match his scheduled $26 million. Extending Jordan would\u2019ve placed limits on the Clippers\u2019 salary cap flexibility, and there were other reasons the Clippers weren\u2019t big on keeping \u201cMr. Clipper.\u201d Although he\u2019s one of the best rebounders of this generation, Jordan has slipped a notch as a rim protector and remains a non-factor offensively. He\u2019s the last of a dying breed: a big man who can\u2019t stray 10 feet from the basket. Clearly, Michael Winger, Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West believe it\u2019s time for massive change, with one exception \u2014 Rivers remains as coach. He\u2019s still among the league\u2019s best and proved so last season when the Clippers, despite the Griffin trade and subsequent upheaval and injuries, won 42 games. However, loyalty only goes so far. The Clippers did trade Austin Rivers to the Wizards for Gortat mainly because they needed a center to replace Jordan. Austin did improve, especially as a 3-point shooter (37.8 percent). But there\u2019s also the sound of relief in Clipperland as the trade put an end to the often awkward vibe caused by a father\/son combo in the same locker room. The Clippers start fresh with Gilgeous-Alexander. He\u2019s a long (6-foot-6) point guard coming off an impressive showing in NBA Summer League, where he displayed a smooth handle and good defensive instincts. He\u2019s a late-bloomer who didn\u2019t start at Kentucky until last January, yet was named MVP of the SEC tournament. The Clippers believe he can have a better rookie season than Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers) or Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks). It\u2019s uncertain how much time he\u2019ll get this season with Pat Beverley and Milos Teodosic returning. That depends on whether he sharpens his 3-point shooting and if Doc Rivers is willing to cope with rookie mistakes. Still, the opportunity is there, and both Beverley and Teodosic are on the final year of their deals. Their other first-rounder brought Robinson, who made big strides in his three years at Boston College (he scored 46 points in one game last season) and could make noise immediately. The Clippers will be big boys on the free-agent market next summer. They extended Montrezl Harrell, but only for two years and $12 million. They brought back Mbah a Moute for one year and $4.3 million. This season is shaping up as a bridge to possibly something better, especially if the Clippers are in play for potential 2019 free agents Kawhi Leonard and\/or Jimmy Butler. Los Angeles will belong to LeBron James and the Lakers this season while the Clippers enter an early phase of their reinvention. The search begins for a new identity, and a new face of the franchise.

The team announced today that Russell Westbrook had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and will be re-evaluated in roughly four weeks. Per the Thunder, Westbrook was experiencing inflammation in his knee this past weekend. The team, Westbrook and his representation determined \u201cthe best course of action was the proactive procedure, performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache with Thunder medical personnel present at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles,\u201d the Thunder said in a release. Here\u2019s the team\u2019s full release on Westbrook\u2019s procedure: Per Erik Horne of The Oklahoman (via Twitter), Westbrook\u2019s injury means newly acquired point guard Dennis Schroder will likely get the majority of the starters reps during training camp and the preseason. The Thunder open training camp on Sept. 24. Additionally, a re-evaluation of Westbrook\u2019s status in four weeks would be around Oct. 10. That would be a week away from OKC\u2019s regular-season opener against the Golden State Warriors ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). As Horne points out, that would be a re-evaluation date and not a guaranteed return date for the 2016-17 Kia MVP winner. In the 2013 playoffs, Westbrook suffered a right knee injury in Game 2 against the Houston Rockets and needed surgery to repair a torn meniscus in the knee . He had surgery on the knee two more times in 2013, once in October and again in late December . However, he recovered and has appeared in 308 of a possible 328 regular-season games since the start of the 2014-15 season. The Thunder were active in the offseason, parting ways with Carmelo Anthony in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks that netted them Schroder . Additionally, they re-signed All-Star swingman Paul George and defensive-minded forward Jerami Grant while also picking up Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot, Abdel Nader and Nerlens Noel in other transactions .

Blake Griffin arrived from the LA Clippers and understandably suffered from culture and climate shock, yet was tagged with the responsibility of saving the Pistons\u2019 season and Van Gundy\u2019s job. He managed to do neither, and perhaps the request was a bit too ambitious anyway. While Griffin managed a decent working relationship next to All-Star center Andre Drummond, the Pistons couldn\u2019t muster any momentum to at least reach the playoffs in a watered-down Eastern Conference. That\u2019s because point guard Reggie Jackson only played 45 games because of injury once again, and Detroit continued to receive marginal at best results from former lottery picks. As a result, owner Tom Gores finally reached the end of his patience and the billionaire owner made a long-expected decision to remove Van Gundy as coach and team president . What the heck happened? Why didn\u2019t Van Gundy work out? Start with rolling the clock back four years. Van Gundy was unemployed but in demand as a coach, having done decent work for half a decade with the Orlando Magic. The Pistons removed longtime GM Joe Dumars from power and suddenly, a rare opportunity arose. Van Gundy wanted personnel control along with the coaching job so he could avoid the kind of messy problems he had with Dwight Howard in Orlando . The Pistons gave him both roles and final say in all personnel matters, something that only San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and Clippers coach Doc Rivers had at the time. Four years later, Van Gundy missed the postseason three times and never won a playoff game. He inherited a mess, sure, but Van Gundy had a spotty performance with both jobs. With the exception of Griffin \u2014 who\u2019ll cost the Pistons a ton as he gets older \u2014 Van Gundy never found a foundational player ( as Drummond was originally drafted under the Dumars regime ). Perhaps his biggest move was trading for Jackson in 2015 , who has been healthy for only one of three seasons in Detroit. The Draft overall was a big whiff as well, with Stanley Johnson ( over Myles Turner and Devin Booker in 2015 ), Henry Ellison ( over Malcolm Brogdon in 2016 ) and Luke Kennard ( one spot ahead of Donovan Mitchell in 2017 ) being Van Gundy\u2019s first-round picks. All seem, at best, rotational filler right now. He did get Tobias Harris (later included in the Griffin deal) on the cheap, yet gave out-sized contracts in free agency to Jon Leuer and Boban Marjanovic. Essentially, the Pistons roster was a mix of underachievers and role players, along with a gimpy guard and a center who did become an All-Star, yet never advanced much offensively. After dismissing Van Gundy, Gores chose to keep the two jobs separate and hired Ed Stefanski, a veteran executive, to run the club . Stefanski wisely waited on the coaching search, and sure enough, a good candidate turned up on radar. Casey became available because his biggest crime in Toronto was an inability to beat LeBron James in the playoffs . In a bizarre, almost comical scene that may never be repeated, Casey was congratulated by the Pistons  and  Raptors on social media for winning Coach of the Year. Casey won 59 games with the Raptors partly because he made changes to his system (his team also had perfect health, which helped). A strong communicator who, as a Mavericks assistant coach devised a game plan to stop LeBron in the 2011 Finals , Casey brings much to the job. What he won\u2019t have is a lottery pick to mentor. The Pistons surrendered their No. 1 in the Griffin deal and they\u2019ll forge ahead with virtually the same roster as last season. At least they\u2019ll have Griffin for a full season and maybe that, along with Casey\u2019s touch, will be the difference between getting into the postseason or missing the cut. The East is weaker if only because LeBron going West means the Cavs won\u2019t be a title contender and should fall back to the pack. With their second-round pick, the Pistons took Brown, who could get looks at point guard and did have encouraging moments in NBA Summer League. They were cap-strapped, for the most part, because of deals to Griffin, Drummond and Jackson, so their free-agent options were limited. They came to the market with coupons and came away with rotation filler: Pachulia, Calderon and Robinson III, the youngest of this bunch by far at 24. The Pistons will need maybe a few more years to completely remake their team and distance themselves from the Van Gundy regime. But getting a coach with Casey\u2019s track record seems like a good start. Eventually they need to determine if Griffin is truly a foundational piece, or merely a massive contract that needs to be moved.

Love will be looked to as the leader of the team in 2018-19 and is apparently taking an early step in living up to that role. Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com reports Love is hosting his Cavs teammates as they go through a series of workouts at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. The Cavs and many other NBA teams will officially open training camp on Sept. 24. Love, however, is carrying on a tradition for the Cavs that former star LeBron James put in place the last few offseasons. Here\u2019s more from Vardon on Love and the Cavs\u2019 workouts in Miami : Love averaged 17.6 points and 9.3 rebounds per game for the Cavs last season and was an All-Star for the second straight season as well. He missed that game, however, because of a broken bone in his hand. He has been mentioned in trade speculation since arriving in Cleveland, but the 6-foot-10 big man with a guard\u2019s shooting range now becomes the centerpiece of the franchise. The Cavs originally acquired Love in 2014 in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Aug. 23, 2014 for Andrew Wiggins \u2014 whom Cleveland took with the No. 1 overall Draft pick that year. Love appeared in 59 games for Cleveland last season, shooting .415 from beyond the arc and a career-high .880 from the foul line. Love was one of just four NBA players \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic and DeMarcus Cousins were the others \u2014 to make at least 100 3-pointers while averaging at least nine rebounds in 2017-18. Over the last four seasons, Love has played in 271 games and averaged a double-double (17.1 ppg, 10 rpg) during that span. Since the 2014-15 season, he leads the team in total rebounds (2,705), double-doubles (145) and 3-pointers (584). In Cavaliers history, Love already ranks fourth in 3-pointers made, 10th in defensive rebounds (2,165) and 12th in total rebounds. He has also helped the Cavs reach the postseason in all four years, including their run to the NBA title in 2016 . Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Charlotte has made the playoffs only three times since 2004-05 , and the club is still looking to advance beyond the first round in that span. The Hornets took a step sideways in what was a 2017-18 season of mixed results when help for All-Star guard Kemba Walker never materialized. Years of marginal Draft picks and poor trades finally caught up to the Hornets and subsequently forced major front office changes. Rich Cho was fired as general manager and replaced by Mitch Kupchak and Clifford was bounced in favor of Borrego . Also, the Howard experiment fizzled after only one season, although that was not a big surprise. The Hornets entered the offseason desperately seeking leadership, stability and mostly, some life in the lineup. You know what has plagued Jordan throughout his ownership? He\u2019s still the face of the franchise. Well, sure, finding someone to become more famous than the Jumpman himself might be unrealistic. But how about drafting, developing or signing a player who\u2019ll make Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton the No. 2 athlete in town? Is that asking too much? The Hornets can\u2019t seem to get that difference-maker, with all due respects to Walker. Some of it is front-office mistakes, some of it bad luck. They selected No. 2 in Drafts where Dwight Howard ( 2004 ) and Anthony Davis ( 2012 ) were the clear No. 1 picks. But that\u2019s excuse-making. There are other ways to build when the ping-pong balls don\u2019t drop your way and the Hornets didn\u2019t manage well with those options, either. Nicolas Batum has been a dreadful addition considering the cost ( five years, $120 million extension in 2016 ) as he averaged less than 11.6 points a game last season . Marvin Williams, an otherwise decent rotational player, is making $14 million at age 32 and averaged 9.5 ppg . This isn\u2019t smart spending, and such financial clunkers often become a factor when chasing other options to improve your team. Other than Walker \u2014 who delivered another solid performance ( 22.1 ppg ) \u2014 the Hornets\u2019 lineup suffers from a lack of assets. Kupchak didn\u2019t have much to work with when he walked in the door. That\u2019s why the offseason was so uninspiring for the Hornets. Kupchak did dump Howard on the Nets . But Charlotte had to take back another bad contract in Timofey Mozgov (coincidently given by Kupchak when both were with the Lakers), which was then shoveled to Orlando for, yes, a bad contract belonging to Biyombo . Try to keep up here. Essentially, Kupchak dealt one more year of Howard for two years of Biyombo (along with some second-round picks). What\u2019s crazy is Biyombo was one of those Hornets\u2019 lottery picks ( No. 7, 2011 draft ) that went splat and they refused to extend his rookie contract in 2015. But guess what? Three years later, they\u2019re paying him $17 million a season! What a league! In the Draft, which is traditionally a challenge for Charlotte, the Hornets made a minor deal with the LA Clippers and took Bridges and got some future second-round picks for their trouble. Even then, there was buzz about whether Kupchak made the right decision. That\u2019s because three picks later, small forward Michael Porter Jr. went to the Denver Nuggets. When Porter Jr. tumbled in the Draft because of fears about his back , the Hornets had the chance to roll the dice on someone who, when healthy, would\u2019ve gone much higher. That was a gamble the Hornets weren\u2019t willing to take \u2014 and perhaps just as well, given their luck in the Draft. Past lottery picks Biyombo, Cody Zeller, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Frank Kaminski have been reasonably decent at best, but none bring star potential. Yet the Hornets paid Zeller and Kidd-Gilchrist handsomely after their rookie deals and are doing so for Biyombo, too. A much better-received decision was hiring Borrego, who learned at the lap of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. Borrego, a first-time coach (he had a short interim stint as the Magic\u2019s interim coach in 2015 ), is a solid communicator who helped with the Spurs\u2019 play-calling. Borrego no doubt played a role in the Hornets\u2019 signing of Parker. Yes, Parker is an old 36 and the tires are clearly worn. However, he\u2019s been around winners his entire basketball life. That should go over well in the Charlotte locker room even if the Hornets probably aren\u2019t ready to make a big push next season in the East. Curiously, the Hornets didn\u2019t deal Walker . He\u2019s entering the final year of his team-friendly contract and could bounce in unrestricted free agency next summer. That would be a major loss, and although Walker likes Charlotte, this situation bears watching. Charlotte could pull the trigger by the trade deadline \u2026 or back up the Brinks truck for him next summer. If Bridges is the real deal and the Hornets get more from last year\u2019s No. 1 pick, Malik Monk, they could improve. Otherwise, the biggest excitement to hit town will be in February for NBA All-Star 2019 , where once again, the face on the welcoming committee billboards will most likely be Jordan. Again.

Haslem officially signed his one-year, $2.4 million contract with the Heat on Monday, a deal that was struck last week and finally became official when he put pen to paper. Haslem will enter his 16th NBA season, all with the Heat, and that means the Miami native will be with his hometown franchise for more than half of its 31-year history. \u201cFor the hometown kid in me, that means the world,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cI wish I understood how big that is right now, because I really don\u2019t, but I know it\u2019s big.\u201d Haslem was the seventh-oldest player in the NBA last season \u2014 and will rise at least one spot on that list this season, with the retirement of San Antonio\u2019s Manu Ginobili. Vince Carter is 41 and will play for Atlanta, Dirk Nowitzki is 40 and back with Dallas, and Haslem is 38. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have our captain back,\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said. The others who played last season and are older than Haslem are Jason Terry, Damien Wilkins and Jamal Crawford. They all remain unsigned for the coming season. So, too, does Dwyane Wade. He and Haslem are the only two players who were part of all three Heat championship teams. Haslem said he\u2019s busily recruiting his business partner \u2014 the pair shares several off-court interests, including a pizza chain \u2014 to come back as well. \u201cMy mindset has always been for us to finish it together,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cI want us to do a whole season together. Experience the road, dinner on the road, go through that whole process. I want us to experience that together.\u201d Wade tweeted his congratulations to Haslem when the deal was signed. \u201cYou are (the) most selfless person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Wade said in his tweet. Haslem appeared in only 14 games last season, and hasn\u2019t had much of a role with the Heat in the last three seasons. Haslem believes he can still play \u2014 he has kept himself in tremendous condition \u2014 but knows that he probably won\u2019t have a big on-court presence again. Still, a meeting with Heat coach Erik Spoelstra last week helped seal the deal to return. \u201cMe and Spo were honest with each other,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cHonesty is not always telling somebody what they want to hear. And we both have gotten to that point in our careers where we value each other\u2019s opinions, whether we want to hear them or not. We trust each other. We root for each other. We both have the best interests of this team in mind.\u201d But even if he doesn\u2019t get much in the way of minutes, Haslem knows he\u2019s valued. Spoelstra raves about the way he interacts and mentors teammates, and Haslem said that was a huge part of his decision as well. \u201cIt\u2019s about my love for the organization and my love for the guys,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about me. If I was looking for playing time, I could have gone someplace else or played in China or something. But at the end of the day, would it have made me as happy as being around this organization and being around these guys? No, I don\u2019t think it would.\u201d "},{"id":38755,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-phoenix-suns-devin-booker-hand-surgery","date":"2018-09-10","title":"Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker undergoes hand surgery, out six weeks","content":" Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker underwent hand surgery on Monday, per a release from the team . The procedure repaired the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint in his right hand, and is expected to keep Booker out for six weeks. That time frame would see him recovered roughly one week into the regular season. The 6-foot-6 guard dealt with hand pain during the final month of the 2017-18 season and ultimately sat out the last 12 games. On Monday, shortly after having surgery, Booker posted an image of himself on Instagram with the caption: \u201cThank you for all the prayers and well wishes. First surgery was a success.

Deng entered the free agent market on Sep. 1 when he agreed to a contract buyout with the Los Angeles Lakers . His one-year deal with Minnesota is reportedly worth $2.4 million. Deng appeared in 56 games during his first season with the Lakers, but he played just one game last season with Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka in charge of the Lakers\u2019 front office. Although the 14-year NBA veteran was the Lakers\u2019 highest-paid player last season, he essentially wasn\u2019t part of the team. He appeared in the season opener before dropping out of the rotation and eventually spending long stretches away from the Lakers. The two-time All-Star felt he didn\u2019t fit well into coach Luke Walton\u2019s up-tempo system, and he apparently declined to rejoin the rotation when the Lakers were slowed by injuries. The 33-year-old forward has experience with Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who coached Deng in Chicago from 2010-13. Wojnarowski has more on Thibodeau\u2019s pitch to Deng : Deng was selected with the No. 7 pick of the 2004 NBA Draft. He has career averages of 15.0 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists .

In fact, that number can be linked to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer in several ways. It was in 1970 that Lanier was the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft , selected out of St. Bonaventure by the Detroit Pistons. And it was the 70s as the decade in which Lanier excelled, earning seven of his eight All-Star appearances while averaging 22.7 points and 11.8 rebounds for the Pistons. Dinosaurs ruled the NBA landscape back then, with Lanier achieving his success against the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Dave Cowens, Willis Reed, Nate Thurmond, Elvin Hayes, Artis Gilmore and other legendary big men. Yet it was Lanier who was the MVP of the 1974 All-Star Game, who won the one-off, 32-contestant 1-on-1 championship tournament run by ABC in 1973 as part of its national broadcast schedule and who (with Walton) got name-dropped by Abdul-Jabbar in the 1980 Hollywood comedy \u201cAirplane!\u201d [\u201cI\u2019m out there busting my buns every night!\u201d he tells a kid as \u201cco-pilot Roger Murdock.\u201d \u201cTell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes!\u201d] Lanier\u2019s Detroit teams never got beyond the conference semifinals, though, so in 1979-80 he asked to be traded. In February 1980, the Pistons dealt him to Milwaukee for Kent Benson and a future draft pick. With the Bucks, who averaged 59 victories in Lanier\u2019s four full seasons there, Lanier flirted with his greatest team success, yet never reached The Finals. He was 36 when bad knees and other injuries forced him to retire. Those knees still are trouble, preventing Lanier from attending this year\u2019s Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremony \u2014 he was elected in 1992 \u2014 and limiting his ability to travel from his home in Arizona to catch his daughter Khalia\u2019s volleyball games at USC. But the man nicknamed \u201cThe Dobber\u201d was as chatty and opinionated as ever in a phone conversation last week with NBA.com: NBA.com : The league still keeps you busy, doesn\u2019t it? Bob Lanier : Well, it did. But about 15 months ago, I had knee replacement surgery on my right leg and that is not going very well. It still aches and it gets me unbalanced. That\u2019s what I was trying to get away from. The surgeon said mine was the most difficult one he\u2019d ever done. I was supposed to get the left one done but I couldn\u2019t, because the right one was bothering me so much. I can\u2019t even stand to hit a golf ball. NBA.com : You were part of the original Stay In School initiative, if I recall correctly. BL : I was involved with a little bit of everything from the time David [Stern, longtime NBA commissioner] first called me in 1988. It started off with wanting me to do something for kids who stayed in school. We did \u201cP-R-I-D-E,\u201d with P for positive mental attitude, R for respect, I for intelligent choice-making, D for dreaming and setting goals, and E for effort and education. It was really amazing. The first year, we were talking about giving out 25,000 Starter jackets for kids who came to the rally. Shoot, we needed double that amount, the numbers we got. Everything is kind of under the same umbrella now with NBA Cares. Kathy Behrens [president, social responsibility and player programs] has done a wonderful job of taking this to a whole \u2018nother level, her and Adam [Silver, NBA commissioner]. NBA.com: Have you ever had one of those kids whose lives you touched reach out to you years later? BL : [Laughs]. You know what, I\u2019m laughing because you don\u2019t expect to hear from anybody. The only time that somebody really validated something we were doing was when I wrote those books. (The \u201cHey, Li\u2019l D!\u201d series of kids books, loosely based on Lanier\u2019s childhood adventures. Co-authored with Heather Goodyear in 2003, the Scholastic Paperbacks books still are available.) I was on a plane and one of the passengers asked me to sign the book for her, for her child. I was so taken aback by that, I was shaking while I was signing the autograph. That was really good \u2014 I thought, maybe I did something right. NBA.com : But none of the Stay In School kids? BL : Look, in our business, in community relations and social responsibility areas, you don\u2019t really \u2026 when you\u2019re building houses for people, the folks who work with you side by side give you a thumbs up and say thank you before it\u2019s over. When we do the playgrounds, we use kids in the neighborhood who are going to enjoy playing in it and having dreams \u2014 they\u2019re thankful. But there\u2019s so much need out here. When you\u2019re traveling around to different cities and different countries, you see there are so many people in dire straits that the NBA can only do so much. We make a vast, vast difference, but there\u2019s always so much more to do. NBA.com : I know you\u2019re not in it for the thank yous. BL : No. The only thing that stands out to me is from when I was still playing in Milwaukee and I was getting gas at a station on, I think it was Center St. A guy came up to me and said, \u201cMy dad is sick. And you\u2019re his favorite player. Could you come up to the house and say hello to him? The house is right next door.\u201d So I went over, I went upstairs. The guy was laying there in his bed. His son said, \u201cThis is Bob,\u201d and he was like, \u201cI know.\u201d And he just had a little smile, a twinkle in his eye. And he grabbed my hand and squeezed it. And we said a little prayer. About two weeks later, his dad had died. And he left a card at the Bucks office, just saying \u201cThank you for making one of my dad\u2019s final days into a good day.\u201d NBA.com : It probably wasn\u2019t, and isn\u2019t, uncommon for you to be spotted out in public like that. At your size (6-foot-11, 250 pounds as a player). BL : As time passes on, people know you at first because you\u2019re a player. Then you stop playing. And 10 years after, when a player like Shaquille O\u2019Neal comes along, they know him and figure you must be Shaq\u2019s dad. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing them big shoes.\u201d I just go along with it. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m Shaq\u2019s dad!\u201d NBA.com : That has to sting, seeing as how Shaq took your title for the NBA\u2019s biggest sneakers. You were famous for your size-22s.  BL : Yeah, he sent me a pair one time and I think they were 23s. For some reason, I recall he would wear 23s and three pairs of socks or something instead of the 22s. NBA.com : Isn\u2019t it sobering how quickly sports fans forget even distinctive-looking players such as yourself? BL : Absolutely correct. But that\u2019s why we in the NBA and at the players association have to do a better job of passing down the history of our game. In a way that they\u2019ll absorb it. Not necessarily that they\u2019ll have to read it \u2013 it could be in a video game form, because that seems to hold interest a lot. NBA.com : You have been as busy in your post-playing career for the NBA as you ever were while playing, right? BL : I\u2019ve really been blessed. You know this story: I started serving people with my mother [Nattie Mae] at church. Getting food to people who were sick or needy, taking it to the hospital, taking it to people\u2019s houses or feeding them right after church. My mother was a Seventh Day Adventist and she was in the church all the time. She had me and my sister and a bunch of kids, we would all be there every Saturday. You start off doing it not only because your mother tells you to, but the food was good. Then David asked me to come help with the Stay In School, which was the start of it all. If I hadn\u2019t graduated from college, I probably would never have gotten an opportunity to do that with the NBA. Plus, the amazing number of young people I\u2019ve met around the country, around the world, that I think I\u2019ve touched \u2026 some lives. I can\u2019t say I touched everybody, but some. I always had a knack of selecting \u2014 when I\u2019d call up kids to help me with the presentation \u2014 a girl or a boy who needed it. It\u2019s amazing how many times a teacher has said to me, \u201cYou picked Joe\u201d or \u201cYou picked Dorothy, and that\u2019s a really difficult kid. You made them feel good.\u201d You never let a kid fail. NBA.com : You never were a shy and retiring type. What do you think of the NBA these days? BL : I\u2019ll tell you what, I wish that I were playing now. It\u2019s not as physical a sport. You can do stuff anywhere in the world. You can make tons of money off the court \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine how much I\u2019d make with a speaker deal and those big-ass sneakers of mine. The only thing I would not like about this era is that you\u2019ve got to be so conscious of social media. And people taking photos of you when you don\u2019t know they\u2019re taking them. And having those things that zoom over your home and take pictures of your house. That part I wouldn\u2019t like at all. NBA.com : It\u2019s hard enough to avoid the public eye at your size. By the way, are you as tall as you used to be? BL : No, no. I remember standing next to Magic [Johnson] last year at some function we had, and I was looking at him eye-to-eye. I said, \u201cDamn, I thought I was 6-11 and you were 6-9. You look like you\u2019re taller than me now.\u201d NBA.com : You might have fared well today, with the range you had on your jump shot. A big man like you or Bob McAdoo would fit right in. BL : But Mac was a true forward and I was a true center. With the game the way it is now, I think guys like he or I \u2014 Dave Cowens, too \u2014 could shoot from outside, inside, open up the lanes, make good passes. I say that gingerly with Mac, because every time it touched his hands it was going up. He\u2019s my boy but that\u2019s the truth. NBA.com : Wayne Embry, the NBA lifer as a player and executive, recently said to me about the current style of play, \u201cC\u2019mon, the big man likes to play too.\u201d The game has gotten so much smaller. BL : I kind of like this game a little bit. If you\u2019re a big who has skills, it helps to stretch the floor. You can always post up, if you\u2019ve got a big can post up. But now you\u2019ve got these bigs who are elongated forwards. Boogie Cousins is probably our last post-up big that I\u2019m aware of. I think I just saw him on TV somewhere making about 10 3-pointers in a row. NBA.com : Any team or individuals to whom you pay particular attention? BL : I like watching \u2018Bron [LeBron James], obviously. I like this Golden State team, too, because they play so well together. I like the kid [Anthony] Davis. With Boogie, my concern is whether he\u2019ll be healthy this season. NBA.com : What\u2019s your take on the \u201csuper team\u201d approach of the past few years? BL : I think both of \u2018em have their sides. Back in the day, we would never do that. There wasn\u2019t a lot of huggin\u2019 and kissin\u2019, all that stuff, when you were competing. You were out there to kick each other\u2019s butt. But with AAU ball, it\u2019s become guys playing together on these premier teams at all these tournaments around the country. So they get to know each before they ever go to college. NBA.com : Do you think today\u2019s players appreciate the work you and other alumni did to build the league? BL : I think everything evolves. The best thing I could say as a player is, you want to leave the game in better shape than when you came into it. You want to leave a legacy, a better brand. You want players to be making more money. You want the league to be stronger. And since we\u2019re partner in this, it\u2019s important that those kinds of things happen. NBA.com : The 1970s seems to be pretty neglected, as far as NBA memories and highlights. At times it\u2019s as if the league went from Bill Russell\u2019s Boston Celtics dynasty to Magic Johnson and Larry Bird carrying the NBA into the 80s. The league had some popularity and PR issues back then, but eight different franchises won championships that decade.  BL : Back in the 70s, a lot of people were feeling that the NBA was drug-infested. Too black. That\u2019s one of the reasons the league came up with its substance abuse program, one of the first in sports to do that. The point was not to punish guys but to help guys who needed it to get clean. As that passed, then Larry and Magic came in. The media money started going up, and then Michael [Jordan] came in in \u201984 and everything took off from there. So I can see how you could kind of forget about the 70s. NBA.com : And yet now folks complain that each season starts with only three or four teams seen as capable of winning the title. Why was it different then? BL : I think everybody competed a lot. And guys didn\u2019t change teams as much, so when you were facing the Bulls or the Bucks or New York, you had all these rivalries. Lanier against Jabbar! Jabbar against Willis Reed! And then [Wilt] Chamberlain, and Artis Gilmore, and Bill Walton! You had all these great big men and the game was played from inside out. It was a rougher game, a much more physical game that we played in the 70s. You could steer people with elbows. They started cutting down on the number of fights by fining people more. Oh, it was a rough \u2018n\u2019 tumble game. NBA.com : There were, of course, fewer teams. Seventeen when you arrived, for instance. BL : There was so much talent on every team. Every night you were playing against somebody really damn good, and if you didn\u2019t come to play, they\u2019d whip your behind. NBA.com : You know, I\u2019m surprised I never heard about you being the target of a bidding war with the old ABA? Did they ever come after you? BL : Got approached at the end of my junior year at St. Bonaventure. They offered me a nice contract. But I wanted to stay in school because I thought we had a real chance at winning the NCAA title. NBA.com : Gee, that almost sounds quaint by today\u2019s get-the-money standards. BL : Yeah. Well, I trusted them as a league \u2014 it was the New York Nets, a guy named Roy Boe \u2014 but I knew we had a really good team. And we did. We got to the Final Four. Then I got hurt. NBA.com : You went down against Villanova, your tournament ended by a torn ligament. I\u2019m surprised, looking back, you were considered healthy enough to get drafted No. 1 and have a pretty strong rookie season. BL : I wasn\u2019t healthy when I got to the league. I shouldn\u2019t have played my first year. But there was so much pressure from them to play, I would have been much better off \u2014 and our team would have been much better served \u2014 if I had just sat out that year and worked on my knee. NBA.com : From the Final Four to the start of the NBA season isn\u2019t much time to rehab a knee injury. Then you played 82 games, averaging 15.6 points and 8.1 rebounds in 24.6 minutes. BL : That was stupid. My knee was so sore every single day that it was ludicrous to be doing what I was doing. I wanted to play, but I was smart and the team was smart, everybody would have benefited. NBA.com : Did you ever fully recover? I know your later years were hampered by knee pain. BL : Oh, I fully recovered. Going into my third year, I think I had my legs underneath me a lot. NBA.com : Your coach as a rookie was Butch van Breda Kolff, who had butted heads with Wilt Chamberlain in Los Angeles. Did you have any issues with him? BL : He was a pretty tough coach, but he was a good-hearted person. As a matter of fact, he had a place down on the Jersey shore where he invited me to come and run on the beach to help strengthen my leg. I went there for about 2 1\/2 weeks. I liked Butch a lot. NBA.com : Your Detroit teams had you as an All-Star nearly every season and of course Hall of Fame guard Dave Bing. Did you think you\u2019d achieve more? BL : I think \u201973-74 was our best team [52-30]. We had Dave, Stu Lantz, John Mengelt, Chris Ford, Don Adams, Curtis Rowe, George Trapp. But then for some reason, they traded six guys off that team before the following year. I just didn\u2019t feel we ever had the leadership. I think we had [seven] head coaches in my 10 years there. That was a rough time, because at the end of every year, you\u2019d be so despondent. NBA.com : So by the time you were traded to Milwaukee, you were ready to go? BL : I wanted the trade. But until you start getting on that plane and leaving your family and start crying, you don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a part of your life you\u2019re leaving. I got to Milwaukee and it was freezing outside. But the people gave me a standing ovation and really made me feel welcome. It was the start of a positive change. I just wish I had played with that kind of talent around me when I was young. The only time I thought I had it was that \u201973-74 team they messed up. But if I had had Marques [Johnson] and Sidney [Moncrief] and all of them around me? Damn. NBA.com : I got my start around those Bucks teams, and feel I often have to remind people how good they were deep into the \u201880s. You just couldn\u2019t get past the Celtics and the Sixers in the same year, in a loaded Eastern Conference. BL : They were always a man better than us. We had to play our best to beat them and they didn\u2019t have to play their best to beat us. It haunts me to this day. NBA.com : How did you like playing for Bucks coach Don Nelson? BL : Loved him. It was just like playing for your big brother. He was a player\u2019s coach, for sure. He\u2019d been through it, won championships. Knew what it was like to be a role player, knew what it took to be a prime-time player. Didn\u2019t get upset over pressure. He was just a stand-up guy.  NBA.com : As we talk, I\u2019m looking at my office wall and I have that famous All-Star poster from 1977, painted by Leroy Neiman. That game was notable, too, because it was the first one after the NBA\/ABA merger. So you had Julius Erving, George Gervin, Dan Issel and those other ABA stars flooding their talent into the league. BL : You know what? I think you could put 10 players from the 70s into the league today and be as competitive as anybody. Think of the guys who could really play and were athletic. And with the rule changes, that would make us even more effective. \u201cIce\u2019 [Gervin]. Julius. David Thompson, a huge athlete. I don\u2019t know who could mess with Kareem at all. NBA.com : What about Nate Archibald? BL : You took the words right out of my mouth. Tiny! He could scoot up and down and do what he needed to do. These guys knew the game, they played the basics of it so well. NBA.com : No one disputes the advances in training, nutrition, travel and rest. But in raw ability, you think it was close to today? BL : One thing I will say about this group of young men, they seem to be more athletic than we were. They seem to be able to cover so much more ground. Whatever that new step is, the Eurostep? And another thing they do differently know is, they brush-pick. They brush and then they pop. You rarely see a guy do a solid pick and then roll with the guy on his back to cause a mismatch. Everybody\u2019s looking to open the floor to shoot 3\u2019s. This has become the weapon of choice now. NBA.com : No rings for that Milwaukee team from which you retired has meant, so far, no Hall of Fame for Marques Johnson or Sidney Moncrief, the two stars.  BL : That\u2019s what rings hollow in your ears. You hear people saying, \u201cWhere\u2019s the ring? The ring!\u201d And we don\u2019t have any rings. That\u2019s what we play for. NBA.com : Didn\u2019t stop your enshrinement though. BL : They must have been blind, crippled and crazy, huh? It\u2019s a short crop of brotherhood that gets in there. I just wish there was more time on those weekends where we could spend time just talking with one another. You rarely see each other, and it would be nice to have a quiet room where you could just re-hash old times and plays, and maybe have your family so your grandkids could listen to Earl the Pearl tell about this or [Bill] Walton tell about that. Just rehashing stuff that brought people a lot of joy. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

From Jordan Landfair: Many agree with your position, Jordan. But, I don\u2019t, and the reason is simple: it\u2019s going to be very, very difficult for Cleveland to attract free agents, as it has been historically, in the next few years. Without that avenue to roster building, Cleveland will be limited to the Draft. The Cavs have gotten off to a good start with their first-rounder this year, Collin Sexton, but that path is very hard to sustain. Yes, the 76ers have Processed their way back, but it took a long time \u2014 and even after hitting on Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, and with a future as bright as any team in the East, Philly still essentially whiffed in free agency this summer. All of this to say: Love is a bird in the hand who can keep Cleveland competitive in the short term and still will have trade value in a year or two if the Cavs don\u2019t make significant progress. Especially in this first year after LeBron\u2019s departure, and whether the Cavs contend for a playoff spot or not, Cleveland has to give its fans a reason to come out of pocket to pay to see the on-court product. Too many cooks spoil the broth. From Jerry White: That\u2019s certainly possible, Jerry. Of course, it\u2019s also possible Carmelo will start with Harden and Paul, rendering the question moot. My guess is \u2018Melo will still see time with the second unit, so he and Gordon will have to work things out. They\u2019re both vets and the goal is winning it all, and they\u2019ve both been paid handsomely over the years. The more effective that second group is, the less stress there will be on Harden and CP3. With Ryan Anderson gone, there should be more shots for bench players next season as well. A slippery, slippery slope. From Lyle Ruthven: Great questions, Lyle. The new mental wellness program that will be on line for this coming season, jointly funded by the NBA and the National Basketball Players\u2019 Association , will be run independent of the league\u2019s teams. So I would imagine teams will not have access to that information, though team psychiatrists and psychologists can be part of a player\u2019s mental wellness program if the player wants them involved. So proprietary information on a player\u2019s mental health should not find its way to his team when it comes to contract negotiations or things like that. As such, the mental wellness program will be different from detailed physical information about players gleaned through advanced monitoring of sleep patterns and other benchmarks that have become standard with most teams. But, none of us should be na\u00efve that there isn\u2019t the potential for mental health information to get into the hands of teams. Most everything, eventually, does. I\u2019m sure it will continue to be a subject discussed between the league and the union. In guarded condition. From Liam Monast: Simply, no. Hayward is an all-court talent who is a very willing passer, and he\u2019ll surely have the ball in his hands from time to time, but why would Boston put the burden of ballhandling and bringing the ball up the floor against elite point guards \u2014 not to mention trying to defend them at the other end \u2014 on Hayward? No team would presuppose everything going wrong as you seem to be doing. Irving will have the rock in his hands, as he should, and Boston believes it will be able to re-sign him next summer no matter the rumors about the Knicks, etc. And even if he leaves in 2019, Rozier was outstanding in the playoffs last spring when Irving was out. He showed he was certainly capable of playing at an extremely high level. And while Boston does have wing depth, it signed Hayward, presumably, because it thought he was better than all of those other wings. Tatum\u2019s emergence as a rookie last season certainly was a positive development for Boston, but it doesn\u2019t mean the Celtics should play their big free agent signee of 2018 out of position for the bulk of his career in Beantown.

If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! $77,000,000 \u2014 Alleged amount stolen from Kevin Garnett during his career, according to a lawsuit the future Hall of Famer filed against his longtime accountant last week . Garnett\u2019s suit alleges the accountant conspired with a wealth manager to defraud him for several years through business ventures controlled by the accountant and manager. The manager, Charles Banks, pled guilty in 2017 to stealing millions from Spurs legend Tim Duncan, another Banks client. 1,064 \u2014 Career NBA games for veteran forward Boris Diaw, who announced his retirement from competitive basketball last week via video on his boat. The 36-year-old Diaw played last season in France after being waived by the Jazz in the summer of 2017. Diaw said in his retirement video that he wanted to stop playing competitively after making 247 appearances during his career for the French national basketball team \u2014 the same number that his mother, Elisabeth Riffiod, made for the French women\u2019s national team during her career as a player, which culminated in her selection in 2006 to the French Basketball Hall of Fame. Diaw, the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player Award winner in 2006, won a championship with the Spurs in 2014. 227 \u2014 Points scored in 21 regular season games last season by Cavs swingman Rodney Hood, who reportedly signed a one-year tender over the weekend to return to Cleveland next season. Hood, acquired by the Cavs at the trade deadline in February, struggled to get consistent minutes down the stretch of the regular season and in the playoffs, but is likely to see much more playing time going forward; the Cavs return very little proven talent on the post-LeBron roster. 1) Covered the tail end of Mo Cheeks\u2019 playing career. Covered his stint as a coach in Philly, and much of his time in Portland with the Blazers. I\u2019ve rarely heard him raise his voice, much less be emotional about anything. But being inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame does things to a person, and it was thus awesome to see Mo\u2019s true feelings come out during his speech Friday, as he teared up while honoring his mother and her role in his development as a player and man. 1A) And anything that gives me an excuse to show this again is worth it. I covered that Portland-Dallas playoff series and was there at Moda Center when Natalie Gilbert, then 13, lost her place while singing the anthem, and Mo came over, so smoothly, put an arm around her and got her back on track. By the end of the anthem everyone, including the sideline reporter, was singing at the top of their lungs, courtesy of yet another Mo Cheeks assist. 2) My long-lasting crush on Sue Bird , who I imagine would be the absolute coolest friend anyone could have, shows no signs of slowing down. Neither does she. 3) Irrefutable proof that there is a supreme being \u2026 who craves creamy nougat . 4) One of the best-written stories  I\u2019ve read in some time. Marvelous work from ESPN.com\u2019s Sarah Spain. 1) Seventeen years ago on Tuesday . Never forget. 2) Obviously, losing Devin Booker for any period of time will be a major blow for the Suns. But it begs the question: if Booker\u2019s hand was initially injured in March, and Phoenix was 10,000 games out of the playoffs, and the Suns\u2019 season ended in mid-April, why didn\u2019t this injury get taken care of then, so he wouldn\u2019t miss the start of training camp \u2014 or any other crucial period of time for the Suns? I was told Sunday night that the hand \u201cflared up recently,\u201d and, okay; maybe there was a thought for most of the summer that nothing needed to be done. But, I don\u2019t know. This is your franchise player. If there\u2019s any question about his hand, go get it cleaned up in April. I just can\u2019t help but think of what Shaq once said about surgeries: get them on the team\u2019s time, not yours. And that\u2019s not good for Phoenix. The Suns desperately need to have a good start this season, and this will be a setback.  3) Extremely concerning. And while everyone is entitled to their day in court and is presumed innocent, the initial description of the alleged incident would seem to point toward league intervention when it comes to potential discipline. 4) In my experience covering sports at all levels, good officials control things with firm words and a calm demeanor, and don\u2019t overreact to harsh language that comes their way. Carlos Ramos, a respected chair umpire who was calling his first U.S. Open women\u2019s final Saturday, overreacted to the torrent of harsh but not at all vulgar language that Serena Williams laid upon him after receiving a warning for receiving coaching and for racket abuse during her match with eventual winner Naomi Osaka. The warning for coaching was, at best, debatable; while Willliams\u2019 coach acknowledged he was sending signals to her, no one other than Twitter cops who often assume the worst about Williams knows with any certainty whether she saw him or not, as she was at the opposite end of the court. But, it was assessed, and Williams should have known that meant no more warnings. And Ramos obviously was right to assess a penalty for racket abuse in the second set. It was the third penalty, for verbal abuse, that was out of line. It put Osaka up 5-3, leaving her one game short of winning the match. That was an outsized impact given what Williams was saying, which was a lot, but used no foul language toward Ramos and did not, no matter what her critics claim, involve her moving toward him in any way. A good official would say, quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you, Mrs. Williams. And that is enough. I will assess you a game penalty if you continue.\u201d Or, he would have just taken it, as many officials do, and kept it rolling, so that the players could fully decide the outcome. (And, the way Osaka was playing, she was likely to win the match, anyway; the 20-year-old was outstanding throughout the tournament.) But Ramos injected himself into things, and by doing so, made the final about him, not about the young, dynamic challenger or the great, all-time champion. Both deserved better. \u2014 Dirk Nowtizki ( @swish41 ), Friday, 6:10 pm, after seeing the new look of his former coach in Dallas, Don Nelson, at Friday\u2019s Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame induction in Springfield. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m my own biggest critic. It\u2019s certainly an honor being the first non-American head coach, and I think it\u2019s a special achievement. But, I don\u2019t feel more pressure than normal. I was lucky enough to get this job, and hopefully I\u2019m good enough to keep it.\u201d \u2014 Suns coach Igor Kokoskov , to The Salt Lake Tribune , on his journey from development coach to assistant coach in Utah to becoming the first international-born NBA head coach. \u201cI think at its core this is a very unselfish group. Why they were 24th in assists last (season), I don\u2019t quite know. That\u2019s in the past. But we don\u2019t want to be a bottom-five assist team. I\u2019m going to demand it, our point guards will demand it and our best players will demand it.\u201d  \u2014 First-year Hornets coach James Borrego , to the Charlotte Observer , on how ball movement will be one of the core tenets of his new team, after spending years in the Spurs\u2019 system as an assistant coach. \u201cShe is the grandma of the league and she\u2019s not ashamed to talk about it either. That\u2019s the funny part about Sue. She\u2019s such an incredible spirited person. She knows she\u2019d old in the WNBA right now, but she\u2019s still kicking ass.\u201d \u2014 Celtics guard Kyrie Irving , to SB Nation , in a piece about his friendship with WNBA legend Sue Bird of the Seattle Storm. Bird and Irving bonded over shoes, as ballers tend to do, and Bird had a pair of Irving\u2019s shoes custom made by my man Kickstradamus for Game 2 of the WNBA Finals Sunday that feature the \u201cGranny\u201d character from Looney Toons cartoons . * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

My Turner colleague Chris Webber has always brought out polarizing opinions \u2014 first as a player, and now as a broadcaster. And I\u2019m not objective when it comes to him, either. I love the guy. He\u2019s a true student of the game, not afraid to speak his mind on and off the court, and is someone whose love for the game knows no equal. It\u2019s just a matter of time before he gets his chance to run a team, either in the front office or as a part-owner. But it will and should happen. And, after his impactful career as a player, he should be enshrined in Springfield. Everyone\u2019s criteria for the Hall is different. To me, getting in the Hall as a player requires a yes answer to two questions: 1) were you among the very best at your position for a substantial period of time during your career, and 2) did your presence and\/or play change the game in a meaningful way while you played? (This is why a guy like Sixers guard Andrew Toney, in my view, is HOF-worthy, even though \u201cThe Boston Strangler\u201d played from 1980-88 and was limited significantly by injury in two of those seasons.) Webber is a \u201cyes\u201d to both of those questions.  In the NBA, Webber was a five-time All-Star, four times with the Kings, and was Rookie of the Year in 1993. He was first- or second-team All NBA four times. His career PER of 20.9 is the highest of any non-retired and Hall of Fame eligible player that isn\u2019t currently in the Hall. (Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett each have higher PERs than Webber, and each is an obvious HOF lock, but they aren\u2019t Hall of Fame eligible until 2020.) Webber\u2019s career PER is better than those of Hall of Famers including Allen Iverson, Bob McAdoo, Ed McCauley, George McGinnis, Billy Cunningham, Steve Nash, David Thompson, Connie Hawkins, Alex English, Walt Bellamy, Cliff Hagan and many others. Yet in his fifth year of eligibility, Webber was again passed over by the Hall of Fame voters this year. That needs to change. His impact on the game, from high school to being a member of the \u201cFab Five\u201d at Michigan in college and during his 15 NBA seasons, is undeniable. The Hall encompasses all of a person\u2019s basketball achievements, and Webber\u2019s career is Hall-worthy. At Country Day High School in Michigan, he led his team to three state championships, averaging 29 points and 13 rebounds per game his senior season , when he was a consensus national player of the year. He then decided to cap an incredible recruiting class, which had three of the top 10 players in the country, among a group of freshmen that came to be known as \u201cThe Fab Five.\u201d (Also on that Michigan team was a junior guard who averaged 2.9 points per game, who had no future as pro player, but who carved out a place for himself nonetheless in the NBA \u2014 Rob Pelinka, who became a high-powered agent representing the likes of Kobe Bryant before becoming the Lakers\u2019 General Manager in 2017 .) \u201cThe Fab Five\u201d, like it or not \u2014 and, I liked it very much \u2014 changed basketball forever. And Webber was the lynchpin of those Michigan teams that reached consecutive NCAA championship games in 1992 and \u201893. Across the board, the Fab Five had long-lasting impact. Aesthetically, they were vanguards, wearing long, loooong shorts that became all the rage throughout basketball. And while trash talking has been at the heart of hoops for generations, Michigan raised it to a team-wide art form. It drove traditionalists crazy, while kids watching at home loved it. They were the accelerant to the \u201cone-and-done\u201d era, even though none of them left Michigan after their freshman season. But seeing five freshmen start games and play the lion\u2019s share of minutes rippled throughout the college game. Going forward, teams didn\u2019t just recruit blue-chippers, they put them on the floor immediately. What John Calipari does annually at Kentucky now is but the logical conclusion to what Michigan started, and every Power 5 team in college basketball has had to follow suit or get left behind. Of course, \u201cThe Fab Five\u201d era wound up being star-crossed. I\u2019m well aware of the penalties assessed to the Michigan program because of the money that Ed Martin gave to players , including Webber. The university vacated the \u201892-93 season, including all of its NCAA Tournament games that year, and took down the banners commemorating \u201cThe Fab Five\u201d and their two Final Four runs. (Michigan also vacated all of its games from 1995-96 because of Martin\u2019s associations with other players on teams during those seasons, and its \u201893, \u201896 and \u201898 NCAA Tournament appearances, as well as its \u201897 NIT title and \u201898 Big 10 Tournament championship.) It\u2019s obvious to me that if not for his involvement with Martin, Webber would have been on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, which won the gold medal in Australia, as well \u2014 another potential feather in his cap that would bolster his Hall of Fame credentials. I will say, as delicately as I can, that there are coaches and players in the Hall that have been accused of doing some of the very things that got Michigan and Webber in so much trouble. That, in and of itself, should not be disqualifying. Webber\u2019s NBA career also did not include a championship. But he was just as impactful on the pro game. Beginning in Golden State and Washington, C-Webb was a category all his own \u2014 a big man with catcher\u2019s mitts for hands who could pulverize in transition, yet was also an incredibly deft passer, both from the post or out front. As a rookie, Webber elevated Golden State from a 34-48 record in 1992-93 to 50-32 the next season . Traded to Washington after that one season with the Warriors, having conflicted mightily with Coach Don Nelson, Webber helped get the then-Bullets to the postseason for the first time in nine years. Once there, the Bullets went toe-to-toe with the defending-champion Bulls in a tough, three-game first-round series in \u201997 . But it wasn\u2019t until Webber was sent to what was then the equivalent of Siberia in the NBA \u2014 Sacramento \u2014 that his game reached full flower. Playing with another excellent passing big man in Vlade Divac, and a flashy savant of a point guard in Jason Williams, Webber and the Kings were the vanguard of the modern NBA game, coming to fruition years before the Suns\u2019 Seven Seconds or Less attack led by one of last week\u2019s Hall of Fame inductees, Steve Nash. The Kings moved the ball with flair and purpose. The Warriors have changed the game forever by stretching the floor to the breaking point for opposing defenses with their 3-point proficiency, but even they didn\u2019t have what Sacramento possessed \u2014 two bigs who could initiate and finish from anywhere inside the 3-point line. No one could do what the Kings could do, and with Webber, Sacramento changed almost overnight from perennial joke to perennial championship contender. The Kings made the playoffs six straight seasons, reaching the Western Conference finals in 2002 before losing in controversial fashion to the Lakers in seven games.  Webber\u2019s knee injury during the Kings\u2019 semifinal playoff series with Dallas in 2003 marked the beginning of the end for him and the Kings. If he hadn\u2019t gotten hurt, Sacramento probably would have beaten the Mavericks and played San Antonio in the West finals. And while San Antonio would have been favored in that series, the Kings would have had a chance, with the winner facing the Nets in The Finals that year. And a championship would also have made C-Webb\u2019s pro career look much different. But, that didn\u2019t happen. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. Webb\u2019s career stands on its own merits. At all levels, he has had impact and changed the game, and he deserves to have his moment in the sun in Springfield. Sometimes it takes players of merit a little longer, for various reasons \u2014 think Spencer Haywood, or, this year, Mo Cheeks. Chris Webber is a Hall of Famer, and it isn\u2019t a close call. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

History, circumstance, timing, luck: they all can conspire to sap the will of even those who are strongest mentally and physically. And dreams can be shattered in those moments of crisis. But the fortunate among us have people in our corner who give us inspiration and encouragement when we most need it. It could be when we are young and don\u2019t know how good we can be; it could be when we\u2019re in the middle of life or career, and have reached a crossroads. But they are there for us when we need them. And, oftentimes, no one outside a small circle knows who they are, or what they did. And many of the 13 people who were enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame last Friday got that push, too. As they prepared to take that last and most precious step, they reflected on some of the people who weren\u2019t always as well-known as others in their lives, but who made a difference. Nine-time WNBA All-Star First Draft pick in WNBA history Three-Time All-WNBA First Team; five-time All-WNBA Second Team Four-Time WNBA champion (Houston Comets, 1997-2000) Two Olympic gold medals (2004, 2008) WNBA All-Decade Team (2006) and one of Top 15 WNBA Players of All-Time (2011) Unsung Hero: Tommy Thompson \u201cI would probably say, if they read articles, they would maybe know my brother,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cMy older brother was the basketball player in my family, and we were really, really close. We competed in everything, down to penmanship. But my seeing him every day, and the dedication he had to the game and the joy he had for it, was what actually got me into basketball. He, as well as Coach David Fizdale (the Knicks\u2019 coach\u2019s family lived in the same apartment complex as the Thompsons). I don\u2019t think anybody knows about David and his role in my game. My brother and David were really, really close friends, best friends at that time. We just spent a lot of long hours together, at our recreation center (in Los Angeles). The toughness. He and my older brother were kind of very, very tough on me. But they built something that I feel like wasn\u2019t in a lot of players that I faced. It was kind of the foundation of not only the player that I was, but also the person.\u201d When you were on the court with them, what did they push on you to improve on in order to get to the level you were capable of? \u201cFor my brother, it was a left hand,\u201d she said. \u201cI even think about that now. When I was still playing in the WNBA, it was something that he said was, if I wanted to be a good player \u2014 I\u2019m a right-handed player \u2014 I would need it to be able to go both ways. And I needed to have a solid left hand. And if I did that, as well as being able to shoot, I would be able to have a long career. And it was something I took totally to heart. I went left so much in my career, I remember Jenny Boucek was yelling out to one of her players to force me right. And then I kind of went right and I scored, and I was like, \u2018Jenny, I\u2019m right handed.\u2019 And she was like \u2018well, I had to tell her something.\u2019 And we both laughed.\u201d Four-time NBA All-Star NBA All-Defensive first team (1982-86) Fifth all time in career steals ( 2,310 ) 13th all time in career assists ( 7,392 ) NBA champion (Philadelphia 76ers, 1983) Unsung Hero: Billy Cunningham \u201cHe allowed me to, he started me as a rookie,\u201d Cheeks said of Cunningham, the Hall of Famer who coached the 76ers from 1977 to 1985. \u201cSo to start me as a rookie (in 1978) on the team we had was, that was pretty big. And he helped me along the way. We had Doc (Hall of Famer Julius Erving), and he told me, if I was going to stay in this league, I had to learn how to make an open shot \u2014 which, back then, was what you had to do. He worked with me to figure out how to make an open shot. And I remember one time on a fast break, I came down on the break and I threw the ball behind my back, and it went out of bounds. And he said \u2018come here.\u2019 And he said it a different way (Laughs). And he said \u2018if you ever want to play, don\u2019t you ever (do that again).\u2019 And that\u2019s the reason why, I mean, I was probably more fundamental, anyway. But he sped that fundamental game up. He was truly instrumental in me getting here.\u201d So how did he help you find your voice as a young point guard, on a team with players like Doc and Andrew Toney and Moses Malone? \u201cThat was not easy to do,\u201d Cheeks said. \u201cWhen I had Doc, and Andrew, and I had Moses, he just told me to run the basketball team. Figure it out. And as I kept going up the ladder, being a little bit better and better, and he got confidence in me running the team, calling this play and that play, I had to figure out the happy balance. Doc would rebound the ball himself and take on the dribble. Different guys did it different ways. But he instilled that confidence in me from day one, giving me that ball and running that team the way he allowed me to do it. To have an opportunity to make the team and then to start as a rookie, he had that confidence in me to do that.\u201d Two-Time ABA All-Star; Three-Time NBA All-Star 1970-71 ABA co-Rookie of the Year 1971 All-ABA First Team NBA champion (Boston Celtics, 1976) First African-American to play for an ACC school (North Carolina, 1966) Unsung Heroine: Evelyn Jarrett, Scott\u2019s junior high school teacher \u201cWhen she met me, I was living by myself,\u201d Scott said. \u201cMy father was an alcoholic, and I was taking care of him. The only thing I wanted to do was finish high school, go into the Marines and be the biggest guy on my block. Because that\u2019s all I ever seen in life. And she started taking me to plays, and she made me study, and she made me do school work. In fact, she made me take the test for Stuyvesant (High School, in New York). I didn\u2019t even want to take the test for the school; she made me take it. I wanted to go to Benjamin Franklin, a basketball school. And she made me take the test for Stuyvesant. \u201cShe made me understand the importance of things that I never really even conceived. She gave me pride and respect for myself. Before then, my father was a cab driver, my mother worked in a laundromat. I didn\u2019t see much in my life but the same thing. Being by myself, taking care of my father while he was sick, I thought life had given me a bad break. I thought no kid should grow up like this. But she came along at the right time to want to be something, to want to do something. And that really carried me on from that point in life.\u201d 2018 Curt Gowdy Award Winner, Print Official Photographer, Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers, Los Angeles Kings, Staples Center Unsung hero: Bill Robbins, Professor, Art Center College of Design \u201cHe encouraged my sports photography path when everyone else discouraged me,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cAlso introduced me to a Sports Illustrated staffer for my first assisting job. Everyone at my commercial art school (Art Center College Of Design) looked down on photojournalism and sports photography. Bill and another teacher kept me focused, so to speak.\u201d Contributor General Manager, Chicago Bulls, 1978-85 NBA Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations, 1986-2000 General Manager, New Jersey Nets, 2000-10 NBA Executive of the Year, 2002 President, Philadelphia 76ers, 2010-13 NBA President of Basketball Operations, 2013-15 Unsung hero: David Stern, NBA Commissioner \u201cDavid gave me an opportunity to work in the NBA,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cAnd I learned more in a year and a half working in the NBA that got me ready to do better things when I got back in the league. He gave me that opportunity. I was trading options on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. And I got a call from Russ Granik (the NBA\u2019s Deputy Commissioner). Scotty Stirling had left his post with the league to go with the Knicks. And he asked me, would I be interested in interviewing with them. \u201cThey were interviewing people and I had come to their attention \u2026 I thought about it for a day and told him, yes. So I went to New York and was interviewed. Didn\u2019t hear anything for about a week, and then they wanted to know if I\u2019d be interested in another discussion \u2026 working in that atmosphere really helped. When I went to the Nets, I was much more qualified to be a GM than I was the first time. When you work in the league office, you see what everybody\u2019s doing \u2014 the good things and the bad things. You\u2019re there and everybody\u2019ll talk to you when you\u2019re in the league. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re hiding secrets from the league.\u201d Seven-time All-Star 1994 NBA co-Rookie of the Year 1997 All-NBA First Team Four-time All-NBA Second Team (1996, 1998-2000) Unsung hero: Mike Krzyzewski, Duke coach \u201cAnd the reason I say this is, I was, I think there are players who, their talent is one thing is at one level, but their belief in their talent exceeds their talent, which elevates their talent, in a weird kind of way,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI think I was talented, but I didn\u2019t believe in it. I wasn\u2019t comfortable. And I think my four years at Duke, and my last year in particular, I got to a point where I was comfortable with the idea, and striving to be, an elite player. And Coach kind of pushed me into that. \u201cAnd my last (year) was really that pivotal moment, where it was my responsibility. And he would say things like, \u2018if I call and play and you see something different, go with your instincts.\u2019 And that\u2019s empowering. And so he knew kind of how to get that out of me. And if I didn\u2019t have that last year at Duke, I don\u2019t know if I come in and have that kind of impact in the NBA. That last year best prepared me for the expectations of being the top pick. That was sort of my struggle. And that\u2019s why Duke was so good for me, because I was not \u2014 this is weird \u2014 I was not comfortable with that idea. He helped with that.\u201d With you, was Coach K a pat-on-the-back motivator, or a kick-in-the-butt motivator? \u201cHe did play and coach with Bob Knight. He\u2019s got a little of that in him, now,\u201d Hill said with a laugh. \u201cIt was both. In that same breath, my senior year, I\u2019m the captain, I\u2019m the best player on the team. He called me out. He called me a prima donna. He coached you hard, maybe harder then than now in some respects. I wonder if people have this sort of idea, this perception about Coach K and Duke, that it\u2019s all peaches and cream, and everybody\u2019s good and we sing Kumbaya and all that. Coach is from Chicago. And there\u2019s a toughness about him. When I see him now, walking on the court, he\u2019s ready for a street fight. And that\u2019s his mentality, that\u2019s how he expects you to play. Like the whole idea of taking charges. That\u2019s putting your body on the line. There\u2019s a little bit of the military academy (there), it\u2019s that sort of principle. So there\u2019s a toughness required to play for him. He demands that.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  Los Angeles Lakers 2017-18 Record:  35-47, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  LeBron James (free agency), Rajon Rondo (free agency), Lance Stephenson (free agency), JaVale McGee (free agency), Michael Beasley (free agency), Moritz Wagner (Draft), Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  Julius Randle, Isaiah Thomas, Brook Lopez, Luol Deng The lowdown:  The Lakers stuck with their plan to devote 2017-18 to developing Randle, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram, all 22 years and younger, for the sake of the future. And for the most part, the returns were positive. Kuzma and Ball made All-Rookie teams while Randle finished strong, tying for the Lakers\u2019 lead in scoring and leading the team in rebounds . As for Ingram, he played with more efficiency. The Lakers also swung a mid-season trade that brought Thomas , although he wasn\u2019t as important to them as the cap space they cleared by shipping Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. to Cleveland. While there was indeed interest in this developmental process all season \u2014 and Kuzma in particular became a fan favorite \u2014 the organization was clearly fixated on the summer of 2018 and the pursuit of game-changing free agents. In what was the worst-kept secret in the NBA (but the best news the Lakers have had in a while), the franchise\u2019s troubles in landing a superstar in free agency ended when LeBron signed a four-year deal . His arrival had a seismic reaction within and beyond the organization. Suddenly, one man made the Lakers a main attraction again. LeBron follows a long line of one-name-only Lakers icons : Elgin, West, Wilt, Kareem, Magic, Shaq and Kobe. Except it\u2019s very possible that he\u2019s had a greater career than those players \u2026 and he\u2019s still not done yet. Only a handful of stars in NBA history have been able to instantly transform average teams into title-contenders and even title-winners. LeBron demonstrated that in both his stints with the Cleveland Cavaliers. True, the Cavs only won one championship on his watch, but he reached five NBA Finals in 11 career seasons with Cleveland. Even more impressive is that LeBron remained at the top of his game last season despite turning 33. He never missed a game in the regular season or playoffs, logging heavy minutes well into June and constantly bailing out the Cavs with hero-ball late in games. A physical marvel and all-around beast, LeBron averaged 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 9.1 assists per game in 36.9 minutes per game during the season. In the playoffs, he raised those numbers to 34 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 9.0 apg in 41.9 mpg . His interest in what Los Angeles can do for him, post-career, is equal to or higher than what the Lakers can do for him. Simply put, this was a decision that goes beyond basketball . Of course, the Lakers are mainly interested in what he can do for them. While LeBron showed no signs of slippage last season \u2014 he turns 34 in December \u2014 sometimes Father Time arrives with little to no warning. You\u2019re great one season, and then the next season, you\u2019re getting beaten off the dribble by lesser players. Essentially, the Lakers are on the clock with LeBron. That\u2019s why their blockbuster summer wasn\u2019t truly a blockbuster. No other significant piece \u2014 besides LeBron \u2014 was added, as the Lakers struck out on their other prime targets. Paul George re-signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder in what was a surprise. The San Antonio Spurs refused to accept the Lakers\u2019 proposals for Kawhi Leonard , who was dealt to the Toronto Raptors. And free-agent center DeMarcus Cousins took a cheap deal with the Golden State Warriors . Had at least one of the above joined LeBron, the Lakers would have Golden State\u2019s full attention. Once those options vaporized, team president Magic Johnson chose to keep his options open for a big free agency period next summer . He then signed a handful of free agents on one-year deals to fill out the rotation and serve as a bridge to next season. However, it\u2019s an interesting mix to say the least: Rondo, JaVale, Lance and Beasley? You won\u2019t find a collection this loosely-wired anywhere else. Of the four, Rondo seems best equipped to make a reasonably sizable ripple. He was vital to the New Orleans Pelicans last season, especially when they lost Cousins for the year, and sparkled in the playoffs. But for some reason, he decided to bounce to yet another team. He\u2019ll compete with Ball for minutes at point guard and that will be interesting. Will Rondo willfully teach a younger player who may eventually take his job? And if Rondo gets the load of the minutes, how soon and how often will we hear from LaVar Ball? And how will Rondo deal with that noise? McGee was stuck on the Warriors\u2019 bench for much of his time there because of matchup issues, yet thrived in the 2018 Finals . He may be good for the Lakers only in certain situations that don\u2019t call for a stretch five, which are suddenly rare in today\u2019s NBA. Oh, and wait: Lance and LeBron, teammates? Will this be the first reality show for LeBron\u2019s production company? The Lakers managed to erase the last mistake of the previous regime when they recently bought out Deng with a stretch provision . This allows the Lakers to increase their spending ability significantly next summer and their salary cap room could be flexible enough to sign another max player. But as Johnson has said many times, the construction of a contender will take place over two summers . The young holdovers plus LeBron make for the boldest experiment in the NBA next season. We\u2019ll see if James can roust the Lakers into playoff form and take them beyond projections. They may not be better than the Warriors, but nobody in the league can beat the new Lakers for people-watching.

He never put his stamp on the franchise \u2014 to be fair, he had little to work with \u2014 but more important, new GM Scott Perry wanted his own man, which is rather routine and understandable. That man became Fizdale , who was hugely popular as an assistant coach in Miami during the \u201cBig Three\u201d era and in Memphis as a coach where he was beloved by all ( except maybe Marc Gasol ). Fizdale didn\u2019t win that confrontation, yet was an attractive candidate on the market nonetheless after Memphis cut him loose . Assuming Fizdale learned his lessons in Memphis and will be better off for it, the Knicks made a good hire. Fizdale has the personality to deal with the demands of New York and the prey-hungry local media will love him. Because Perry was hired in July of 2017, he never had a Draft or free agency in New York until now, so this summer was his first real roll-up-the-sleeves moment. He made only a few minor cosmetic changes, electing not to do anything to jeopardize the projected millions the Knicks will have to spend in the summer of 2019 , and the early returns are favorable. He used the first-rounder on Knox, who never really stood out in his one season at Kentucky because of the system and all the talent there. But Knox put lumps in the throats of Knicks fans during NBA Summer League as he showed grit, all-round skills and a take-charge attitude . He also comes with an NBA body despite being just 18 and moves extremely well on the floor. It\u2019s hard to know if that\u2019ll transfer into his rookie season, but he should factor into the rotation (if not in the starting lineup) right away. That says plenty about him, and also about the lack of competition on the Knicks. Perry also grabbed Robinson in the second round. He endured a checkered path toward the NBA, never playing a single game in college after going back and forth at Western Kentucky. Robinson shined in NBA Summer League play and the Knicks were impressed by the 7-footer\u2019s length, ability to run the floor and skill around the rim. No doubt, he\u2019s raw and unpolished, and a year away from the game didn\u2019t help. That said, Robinson might play his way into the Knicks\u2019 rotation this season. Perry was on the front office staff in Orlando when the Magic drafted Hezonja three years ago at No. 5 overall. Hezonja never sizzled there and, despite not having much competition for minutes, didn\u2019t play his way into a prominent role. The Magic didn\u2019t extend his rookie contract and Perry pounced. It\u2019s hard to know what the Knicks have in Hezonja. He\u2019s a below-average shooter, and with Knox and Tim Hardaway Jr. on the depth chart, minutes at the swing position might be limited. Yet, the Knicks didn\u2019t make a massive investment and if nothing else, Hezonja will be a rotation-filler. A more important offseason looms in 2019 when the Knicks will most likely be back in the Draft lottery and also have upwards of $30 million or more to spend. Will the Knicks finally seize its big-city advantage over the rest of the NBA and get a lead singer? The idea of the Knicks being this destination franchise was always overstated. That\u2019s perhaps due to the perception of the franchise, the high cost of living (yes, millionaire athletes have budgets, too) and playing in New York doesn\u2019t automatically translate into big endorsement bucks. With the exception of Amar\u2019e Stoudemire eight years ago, the Knicks haven\u2019t maximized the built-in charms of New York among star free agents ( Carmelo Anthony was obtained via trade ). Perhaps that changes in \u201919 when Kyrie Irving (raised in New Jersey) and a few others can hit the market. Perry is out to make the Knicks attractive enough, from a financial and talent standpoint, to be on the radar of stars who are looking for a change in scenery, which is happening at an increasing rate lately. A successful return by Porzingis and a strong rookie season by Knox will go a long way in making that happen.

(AP) \u2014 A\u2019ja Wilson and Kelsey Plum helped the U.S. women\u2019s national team avoid its first home loss in nearly 19 years. The Las Vegas Aces teammates were key in the Americans\u2019 rally from 16-down to beat Canada 74-68 on Saturday in an exhibition game. Wilson had 15 points and 10 rebounds and Plum added eight points. \u201dI didn\u2019t fret the score,\u201d U.S. coach Dawn Staley said. \u201dI knew I was very sure we\u2019d make a run and sure we\u2019d get back in the game.\u201d The U.S. was shockingly down 16 in the first quarter and trailed 56-48 heading into the fourth quarter before finally getting going. Wilson, who was the AP WNBA rookie of the year, along with her Las Vegas Aces teammate Kelsey Plum, keyed the change in the fourth. The Americans hadn\u2019t lost a game on home soil since 1999 when they dropped an exhibition contest at Tennessee. The U.S.\u2019 last loss overall came in 2014 in France in a pre-world cup tournament. The Americans were missing many of their players who will be competing in the FIBA Women\u2019s World Cup which begins later this month in Tenerife, Canary Islands. Sue Bird, Breanna Stewart and Elena Delle Donne are still playing in the WNBA Finals. Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner just saw their WNBA season end after Phoenix was eliminated in the semifinals. The five Olympians are all expected to be part of the team that plays in the world cup. Even without those stars, the U.S. still had 13 WNBA players on its team Saturday, including former WNBA MVPs Tina Charles and Nneka Ogwumike. The Americans had just started training together this week while the majority of the Canadian team had been together for months. The U.S. got off to a sluggish start, shooting just 19 percent in the first half (5 for 27) and trailed 40-28 at the break. The Americans were able to stay in the game by going 18-for-24 from the free throw line. \u201dI thought it was as bad a half that we could play,\u201d Staley said. \u201dObviously we couldn\u2019t get the shots to fall. Coming out of the locker room at halftime it couldn\u2019t get any worse. We needed to stay the course. Players who had been in these situations before. We found our rhythm a little bit and got control of the game.\u201d Kia Nurse gave Canada its early cushion and finished the game with 22 points. \u201dHeld them to 28 points at halftime and we stopped making shots in the second half,\u201d Canada coach Lisa Thomaidis said. \u201dThe U.S. pounded us on the boards in the second half. We got some shots and we were right there, we weren\u2019t able to knock them down at the end.\u201d The Americans trailed by eight heading into the fourth quarter, and a quick basket by Canada made it a double-digit deficit. That\u2019s when Wilson and Plum got going. Her 3-pointer with 4:10 left gave the U.S. its first lead since 2-0. Wilson then added two free throws. After a Canada basket, both teams went scoreless for a bit before Elizabeth Williams\u2019 layup with just under 2 minutes left made it a five-point game and Canada could get no closer than three the rest of the way.

With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Brooklyn Nets 2017-18 Record:  28-54, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Shabazz Napier (free agency), Jared Dudley (trade), Ed Davis (free agency), Kenneth Faried (trade), Dzanan Musa (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  Dante Cunningham, Jeremy Lin, Jahlil Okafor, Nik Stauskas, Darrell Arthur The lowdown:  The rebuilding of the Nets, which has taken an unconventional route because of their lack of lottery picks, managed a few more weird turns in 2017-18. Lin was done for the season after injuring his knee on opening night, and D\u2019Angelo Russell played only 48 games because of injuries. Yet the Nets received some unexpected help from Spencer Dinwiddie, who replaced Russell in the lineup and finished third in Kia Most Improved Player voting . DeMarre Carroll rebounded from a poor final season in Toronto with a strong debut year in Brooklyn and former first-round pick Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had some breakout moments. Otherwise, the Nets mainly sputtered as expected, though respectfully so. It\u2019s hard to find a basketball egghead who doesn\u2019t sympathize with and appreciate the work of Nets GM Sean Marks. Hired in 2016 to rescue a wounded franchise that didn\u2019t have its own first-round pick for three straight years, Marks has done wonders \u2014 all things considered. That continued again this offseason. Almost every transaction with Marks\u2019 fingerprints was done with the future in mind. His plan is simple: hoard young talent, hope one or two pan out, become a dumping ground for bad contracts (to collect additional first-rounders) and clear the salary cap for the summer of 2019. Marks wants to position the Nets for free agency next summer because you never know who might want to play in the big city. Kyrie Irving? Jimmy Butler? Someone else? Even if the Nets strike out in free agency, they\u2019ll have cap room to absorb a contract in case a disgruntled or devalued star becomes available in a trade (which happens regularly, with Kawhi Leonard proving that point ). Cap flexibility plus developing young talent can give an NBA team plenty of options, and as you know, the Nets haven\u2019t had many options since making a franchise-wrecking deal with the Boston Celtics five years ago . The good news is the Nets now control their future first-round picks and will likely be back in the lottery. If that happens, Marks will have a chance to finally choose a potential star. The Nets had the next-to-last pick in the first round \u2014 thanks to more shrewd maneuvering by Marks \u2014 which made this summer all about fiscal housecleaning, starting with Dwight Howard. The Nets traded for him and then quickly executed a buyout and his deal disappears off Brooklyn\u2019s books next summer. Meanwhile, the Nets escaped a $16.7 million hit in 2019-20 of Timofey Mozgov, who was sent to Charlotte in the deal ( before he, too, was dealt again ). Another future salary shredding was Lin, sent to the Atlanta Hawks for a plate of cheese grits. That allowed the Nets to absorb the contracts of Faried and Arthur , who are on expiring deals. Denver tossed in a protected 2019 pick to seal the trade (and Brooklyn used Arthur to get Dudley from Phoenix ). That means the Nets are only on the hook in 2019-20 for Allen Crabbe and Joe Harris. Harris was given a team-friendly two-year deal this summer, with the second year of his deal going for $8 million. If they decline the cap holds for a few players, the Nets could have more than $60 million to chase free agents. Of course, by doing that they\u2019d risk losing youngsters Hollis-Jefferson, Russell and Caris LeVert to free agency. Most likely, the Nets will find a way to keep two (or all three) because those players likely won\u2019t command big money, even in a rising market next summer. The Nets added talent on inexpensive, short-term deals by adding ex-Trail Blazers reserves Davis and Napier. Davis is a worker bee and was the NBA\u2019s No. 1 ranked rebounder off the bench (7.4 rpg). Napier set career highs in scoring (8.7 ppg), 3-point shooting (37.6 percent) as a key reserve for Portland. Both should crack the rotation although there\u2019s competition at those positions. Curiously, the Nets took a pass on re-signing Okafor, a restricted free agent. Ordinarily, he\u2019d be exactly what the Nets were looking for: a devalued young player who, if put in the right environment, would thrive and realize his potential. If the Nets, who are starved for talent, don\u2019t think a former No. 3 overall pick who\u2019s only 22 wasn\u2019t worth their time, it doesn\u2019t speak well for Okafor \u2013 who landed in New Orleans. So that\u2019s the extent of the Nets\u2019 offseason. The names Faried, Davis and Napier probably won\u2019t put Brooklyn in position to push for a playoff spot next season. But their contracts will soon allow the Nets to go star hunting next summer. It should be an interesting time for New York City in July of 2019, with both the Nets and New York Knicks projected to have millions to spend . It\u2019s not exactly the Yankees vs. Mets, but a borough fight is brewing nonetheless. We\u2019ll see who handles their money wisely. One thing\u2019s for sure: It\u2019s hard to imagine Marks blowing that opportunity. In a short time on the job, he got first-round picks, added young talent and cleared the salary cap. That\u2019s just shy of a miracle. Marks has managed to turn 50 cents into a dollar. We\u2019re anxious to see his next trick.

Things like accolades. Compliments. Friendly jabs. Funny anecdotes. Bits of wisdom. And a whole lot of thank yous. Steve Nash, Jason Kidd and Maurice Cheeks were the actual career playmakers among the NBA stars and representatives of amateur, international and women\u2019s games who were officially inducted in a show staged at Symphony Hall and broadcast on NBA TV. But as so often happens on a basketball court, generosity becomes contagious. It could be argued all the honorees in attendance became point guards, point forwards, point coaches or point executives, dishing back to those who had helped them along the way. Nash, notably, was at his two-time MVP best. He wrapped up his speech in the gorgeous setting before an audience of hoops royalty, sharing a laundry list of tips to kids who be growing up playing hockey and soccer, in some unlikely basketball outpost like Victoria, British Columbia. \u201cFind something you love to do\u201d Nash said, launching into his staccato advice. \u201cDo it every day. Be obsessed \u2013 balance will come later. Use your imagination. Put pen to paper. Declare your intentions. Set small goals. Knock them off, set more goals. Gain momentum. Build confidence. Form a deep belief. Outwork people. \u201cPlay the long game \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be the chosen one. The secret is to build a resolve and spirit, to enjoy the plateaus in the times when it feels like you\u2019re not improving and you question why you\u2019re doing this. If you\u2019re patient, the plateaus will become springboards. \u201cFinally, never stop striving, reaching for your goals until you get there. But the truth is, even when you get there \u2013 even when you get here , standing on this stage \u2013 after striving, fighting, pushing yourself to the limit every day, that you\u2019ll miss and you\u2019ll long for. You\u2019ll never be more alive than when you give something everything you have.\u201d Given Nash\u2019s underdog background and underwhelming physical stature \u2013 he cracked a few jokes at his own expense \u2013 the ideas he imparted sounded as applicable to any endeavor a young (or frankly an old) NBA fan might pursue. Kidd started his speech by crediting Gary Payton \u2013 the fellow Hall of Famer, friend and big brother growing up in the Bay Area and All-Star point guard he\u2019d chosen as his presenter \u2013 for harshly but properly challenging him when the game seemed to come too easily in their youth. Rod Thorn, another 2018 inductee who was running the New Jersey Nets when Kidd led them to consecutive Finals in 2002 and 2003, distilled the point guard\u2019s special skill. \u201cFrom the start,\u201d Thorn said, \u201che made everybody want to run, everybody want to play, because they would get the basketball.\u201d There were lessons to be learned in Ray Allen\u2019s story as well. Raised in a military family, he became a poster guy for preparation and diligence across 10 All-Star appearances and four franchises. Allen boiled his career down to a stark admission. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in talent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here because I worked hard my whole life. Without that hard work, no one in this room would know who I am, except my family.\u201d Cheeks, from a previous generation of NBA point guards, grew emotional when talking about his mother. At one point, he teared up enough that former teammate Julius Erving stepped over from his presenter\u2019s chair to lend support. \u201cThere was nothing you wouldn\u2019t do for us,\u201d Cheeks said, directly addressing his mother in the audience. \u201cI love you so, so much, Mama.\u201d Others talked through tears, too, including early WNBA legend Tina Thompson. Legendary NCAA coach and raconteur Lefty Dreisell, meanwhile, had fellow Hall of Famers and audience members wiping away tears with some of the funniest tales, and delivery of them, of the night. Repeatedly wondering if he was going over his allotted time, Dreisell preemptively wrote off any possibly mistakes to the fact he was 86 years old. \u201cWhen you get old you spend all your time trying to remember names and going to the bathroom,\u201d he said. Longtime team and league exec Rick Welts drew laughs a few times too with a speech written as if a letter addressed to his younger self. Of his early days with the Seattle SuperSonics when Bill Russell was the team\u2019s coach, Welts warned himself. \u201c \u2018Now, he\u2019s going to call you \u2018white boy down the hall\u2019 a lot,\u2019\u201d he said. And of his time spent working for, learning from and sometimes being leery of a driven NBA commissioner David Stern, Welts said: \u201cThere are some who would say that working for him for 17 years and living to tell about it will be your greatest professional achievement.\u201d The rest of the night went similarly, with smiles and emotions sharing the spotlight with kudos and nods to the glittery group of presenters hovering to the inductees right or left, supportive but silent. Here is the Class of 2018 and the Hall of Famers they chose as their presenters: Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  Chicago Bulls 2017-18 Record:  27-55, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Jabari Parker (free agency), Wendell Carter Jr. (Draft), Chandler Hutchison (Draft), Antonio Blakeney (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Jerian Grant, Noah Vonleh, Paul Zipser The lowdown:  The reconstruction of the Bulls in the post-Jimmy Butler era continued for a second phase with encouraging signs on the floor and poor results in the standings. Lauri Markkanen, Chicago\u2019s top pick from 2017 , became a lead option because of his shooting range and post-up ability. In addition, guard Justin Holiday shot 35.9 percent on 3-pointers and Kris Dunn rebounded from a discouraging debut season with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2016-17. Then, things got weird. Bobby Portis slugged Nikola Mirotic , who was eventually traded to the New Orleans Pelicans . Guard Zach LaVine was inconsistent in his limited return from knee surgery. In the end, the Bulls found themselves back in the lottery as their desperate search for more youth and assets turned intense. The Bulls\u2019 oft-embattled front office hasn\u2019t always inspired heavy confidence among the fan base, but maybe GM Gar Foreman and team president John Paxson changed a few minds this offseason. Armed with a pair of first-round picks and ample salary cap space, the Bulls by all accounts had a solid summer by retaining their leading returning scorer (LaVine) and grabbing three players projected to be instant rotation pieces\/regular contributors in the near future. Yes, the summer of 2018 will likely dictate the fortunes of the Bulls in the next few years, with LaVine getting paid, Carter Jr. and Hutchison forming a bright and high-character rookie combo and Parker coming in free agency to revive his injury-interrupted career. Thanks to an offer sheet from the Sacramento Kings that sent somewhat seismic shocks around the NBA globe \u2014 a contract that was eventually matched by the Bulls \u2014 LaVine will make $78 million over the next four years. The size of the deal was questioned for legit reasons as LaVine only played 24 games in a show-me-something, post-injury trial run before entering restricted free agency. He also lacks all-around gifts and flopped in his attempt at being the Bulls\u2019 point guard. LaVine, 23, is just touching his prime and the former two-time Dunk Contest champ brings scoring tendencies to a team that needs buckets. His jumper is streaky yet improved and besides, the Bulls had the cap space. And if he averages 18 or so points per game in 2018-19, that\u2019s the going rate for a player of that ilk these days. They\u2019re understandably high on Carter Jr., who looked terrific in NBA Summer League and should be an ideal fit next to Markkanen. Carter Jr. is a smart player bringing a combination of dirty work and fundamental skills that project him to leave his fingerprints everywhere. He\u2019s 6-foot-10, yet is stocky and plays taller than he is and might get almost all of his time at center. At some point, he\u2019ll replace veteran Robin Lopez \u2014 maybe sooner than later \u2014 especially in the final two minutes of tight games. Hutchison is a sleek swingman who moves amazingly well with or without the ball, especially in the open floor and in transition. He can handle the ball through traffic and covers lots of ground in just a few steps. Plus, he\u2019s a willing 3-point shooter. He led Boise State last year in scoring (including a 44-point game), rebounds, assists and steals and is a jack-of-all-trades type. The Bulls nabbed Hutchison as a part of the Mirotic trade, but the downside was they had to become a salary-dumping spot for Omer Asik\u2019s toxic contract in return. Then there\u2019s Parker, a former No. 2 overall pick . The Bulls jumped on an opportunity to steal the restricted free agent from the Bucks \u2014 who didn\u2019t want to approach the luxury tax \u2014 with what is essentially a one-year gamble (the second year of the contract is a team option) for $20 million. Yes, Parker plays forward and the Bulls suddenly have a glut of those. But again, they had the cap space to spend, and the investment is limited, so it\u2019s a potential win-win for both sides. Parker, an solid scorer before his second injury, can use this season to play his way into a longer stay in his hometown. The Bulls remain youthful, with the meat of next season\u2019s rotation projected to be 26 years old or younger. But this allows them to develop players on the cheap and therefore keep their cap space manageable in case a trade or free-agent signing becomes available. For those keeping track of the arc of the Bulls, consider this: the identity of this team has suddenly flipped. It wasn\u2019t too long ago when the Bulls had Butler, Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo before collapsing under unrealistic expectations with few assets to show for it. They were broken. Now they\u2019re stockpiling some potentially major pieces which can be kept or dealt. It\u2019s seemingly coming together. If so, then history will reflect very kindly on the summer of 2018 \u2014 potentially one for Chicago to remember.

For one, Scott in his day was a super-quick, shot-hoisting point guard who averaged 25 points and 22.6 field-goal attempts in his first three NBA seasons for Phoenix, back in the league\u2019s pre-3-pointer days. For another, Scott was the first black scholarship athlete at the University of North Carolina, adding a little extra cultural cachet to his story. But alas, Scott played his last NBA game more than 38 years ago, back in March 1980 when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were still revving up. Time waits for no man, we were told both by Chaucer and The Rolling Stones, and Scott was realistic as he stepped to a podium at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame . \u201cI played so long ago,\u201d the still slender, still spirited 69-year-old said, \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t even remember when I played. But what I can do is, when they ask, \u2018When did I join the Hall of Fame?\u2019 I can say, \u2018Do you know Grant Hill? Do you know Steve Nash? Well, they were in my class.\u2019 \u201d The comment drew laughs throughout the vast room and all along the stage, filled as it was with other members of the Hall\u2019s Class of 2018. Set for their official enshrinement ceremony at Springfield\u2019s Symphony Hall Friday night, the group of inductees represented basketball at almost every level, across all categories. There were recent NBA superstars: Hill, Nash, Ray Allen. There were old-school guys: Scott, Maurice Cheeks. Charles (Lefty) Driesell, the longtime coach at Maryland and three other schools, represented the NCAA world. Katie Smith and Tina Thompson were on hand as legends of the WNBA and women\u2019s basketball in general.  If you only knew Dino Radja from his four seasons with the Boston Celtics from 1993-97 , you missed most of the Croatian forward\u2019s story (three consecutive EuroLeague titles, a multiple MVP winner, a decorated Olympian and more). Rick Welts, president and COO of the Golden State Warriors, was there as a longtime NBA contributor. Rod Thorn was right next to him as an even longer-time contributor, dating back to his days as the No. 2 pick in the 1963 draft , his stints with teams in vacated markets (Baltimore, St. Louis, Seattle), his status as the GM who drafted Michael Jordan, his work as a Nets executive and his role as the NBA\u2019s top cop in doling out fines and suspensions for much of Commissioner David Stern\u2019s tenure. Two others were absent Friday: point guard Jason Kidd was sick, the crowd was told, though the Hall was hopeful Kidd would arrive for Friday\u2019s ceremony. And Ora Mae Washington, a pioneer in women\u2019s basketball who retired in the 1940s, was being honored posthumously. What was clear, though, was how varied and how diverse this Class of 2018 was. And it happened organically, because basketball remains a meritocratic endeavor, with Hall candidates for the most part emerging organically. \u201cIt\u2019s really incredible to see people who impacted the game in different ways, in different places and in different times,\u201d Nash told NBA.com later. \u201cIt\u2019s a great fabric of our sport. I think it\u2019s a cool addition to the whole process that it\u2019s not just [NBA] players.\u201d Said Smith, the 2008 WNBA MVP, two-time league champion, three-time Olympic gold winner and current coach of the New York Liberty : \u201cIt\u2019s very special that we\u2019re all in it together. Those who are in basketball, it\u2019s wild, because there\u2019s always been an appreciation between all of us.\u201d The all-things-to-all-enshrinees nature of the Naismith Hall has drawn criticism in the past. Trying to properly honor the legends of the NBA alongside still-active college coaches, alongside ABA alumni and international players whose games weren\u2019t available even on short-wave radio \u2026 well, it strikes some as a hodge-podge without consistent, discernible criteria for election. It isn\u2019t an easy sell to an American NBA fan to explain why Radja belongs while Jack Sikma and Sidney Moncrief wait and wait. Or why John Calipari has been in since 2015 but Johnny (Red) Kerr and Rudy Tomjanovich can\u2019t crack the coaching honorees. * 2018 Hall of Fame:  Best moments from NBA inductees It\u2019s not this way in baseball, where the Hall in Cooperstown, N.Y., is all about the major leagues (and their roots, meriting Negro League additions for the past five decades). The shrines to which NFL and NHL players aspire also are very specific to those U.S. or North American leagues, respectively. This one is different. And while some still consider it a weakness, the scenes Thursday and again Friday night make a pretty persuasive argument that this way is more correct. And natural. \u201cBasketball\u2019s one of the few areas where you have the opportunity to make it a worldly event,\u201d Scott said. \u201cEverybody [elsewhere] doesn\u2019t play baseball, everybody doesn\u2019t play football. So those Halls of Fame are confined to particular circumstances. But basketball has different [facets], and I think each one should be recognized, as they are.\u201d Said Welts, whose NBA career began as a ball boy for the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1970s: \u201cThat\u2019s one thing we feel is special about basketball, how inclusive it is, how global it is, how the classes tend to be so varied, how it brings people together. \u201cIt is, in fact, what sports is all about. It doesn\u2019t matter where you came from, it doesn\u2019t matter what your background is. If you do your job, on the court or off, you have an opportunity to have a wonderful life with basketball as your career.\u201d They all are in this together, with no kids table for the amateur, overseas or women\u2019s representatives relative to the NBA stars. For example, Radja played against Hill, Nash, Kidd and Allen. Even though he never was an NBA All-Star, he\u2019ll be enshrined on the same stage, same night as those guys. \u201cYou are showing kids that you can have a role model in every category,\u201d Radja said. \u201cYou can have a set target in your mind for what you want to do. One thing you hear from all these [inductees] is \u2018hard work, hard work, hard work.\u2019 That\u2019s the basic message you want to send to any kid who wants to do anything in sports.\u201d There is a talent knows talent, players respect players vibe to all this, too. Many NBA players embraced the WNBA from the moment it took its baby steps as an enterprise in the late 1990s. Thompson, for instance said that a number of players who either played for the Rockets or spent offseason time in Houston \u2013 Cuttino Mobley, Steve Francis, James Posey, Antonio McDyess, Sam Cassell \u2013 regularly attended Comets\u2019 games. She said Kevin Garnett in Minnesota, a season-ticket holder to Lynx games, was one of her most ardent hecklers. \u201cYou see it now with social media, with young guys in the NBA and how they support the WNBA,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s where LeBron James is probably a throwback to the players who supported the WNBA very early on. He is an absolute student of the game. He\u2019s not just familiar with the NBA and its history. He knows high schoolers. He knows sixth graders. He tweets out something about the WNBA or the fact that he saw a game and an amazing play \u2026 it\u2019s what he is.\u201d There\u2019s a palpable sense of appreciation, education and camaraderie that goes on at this weekend\u2019s events, with big names from the sport\u2019s many threads knitting together. Consider that eight-time NBA All-Star Nash, with his Canadian roots and despite his Phoenix connection, knew little or nothing about Scott \u2013 a five-time NBA\/ABA All-Star and NBA champ with Boston in 1976 \u2013 until they were named Hall classmates at the Final Four in San Antonio last spring. \u201cThe education of this, not only of your classmates but the people all over the Hall of Fame, is one of the funnest parts,\u201d Nash said. \u201cTo be able to recognize different people for their unique skill sets and personalities and stories.\u201d Thompson, Smith and Radja were as tickled to be sharing the stage with the NBA stars as those guys were thrilled to have them there. \u201cThere is a change in the verbiage,\u201d said Thompson, the first-ever WNBA draft pick in 1997. \u201cIt is now the best basketball players in the world .

In a video posted to his Twitter account, the 36-year-old officially announced his retirement on a boat with Charlotte Hornets guard Tony Parker and Rony Turiaf in a Bros. Stories video. Turiaf, Diaw and Parker are all countrymen, having starred for the French national team in years past. Diaw has not played in the NBA since the 2016-17 season, which he spent with the Utah Jazz. They waived him last summer and Diaw spent last year with Levallois Metropolitans of the LNB Pro A league in France. Diaw was selected No. 21 overall in the 2003 Draft by the Atlanta Hawks and spent his first two seasons with the team. He was then dealt to the Phoenix Suns in August of 2005 as a part of the Hawks\u2019 acquisition of former All-Star Joe Johnson. In Phoenix, Diaw\u2019s game took a tremendous leap, as he 13.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game in 81 games en route to being named the Most Improved Player for the 2005-06 season . After roughly 2 1\/2 more seasons in Phoenix, the Suns dealt him to the then-Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) for Jason Richardson, Jared Dudley and others. Diaw was considered a rising star in the early portion of his career in Phoenix, a lithe, athletic, big man with the vision of a point guard that flourished with the run-and-gun Suns. But his career nose-dived soon after when he was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in 2008. He put on weight and didn\u2019t appear interested in playing for a team with no hope of contending. The Bobcats waived Diaw near the end of the 2012 season, and the Spurs brought him in to see if he could rediscover his game while playing alongside close friend and countryman Parker. That\u2019s exactly what happened. He provided some essential versatility on both ends of the court for the Spurs in 2013-14, averaging 9.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.8 assists and shot over 52 percent in 25 minutes per game that season.

He was 92. Family spokesman Nick Wasmiller says DeVos died at his western Michigan home due to complications from an infection. DeVos was born in Grand Rapids, not far from Ada, the community about 140 miles west of Detroit where he later lived and died. DeVos purchased the Magic in 1991, buying them from a group headed by Orlando real estate developer William duPont III. Since then, the team has won five division titles, had seven seasons of 50-plus wins and made the NBA Finals in 1995 and 2009. In 2016, he was inducted into the Magic\u2019s Hall of Fame.   \u201cMr. DeVos\u2019 boundless generosity, inspirational leadership and infectious enthusiasm will always be remembered. Simply, he was the team\u2019s No. 1 cheerleader and the best owner that a Magic fan could ever want for their team,\u201d Magic chief executive officer Alex Martins said in a statement released by the team on Thursday. \u201cWhen the DeVos Family purchased the Magic, his vision was that the team and organization would serve as a platform to improve the Central Florida community. That legacy will certainly live on, both in the Orlando Magic\u2019s community efforts and philanthropic contributions, as well as in the way we strive to play the game with passion, a strong work ethic and integrity, while also bringing people together from all walks of life.\u201d The Orlando Sentinel \u2018s Brian Schmitz and Josh Robbins report that in recent years, the DeVos family restructured its ownership group through estate planning, changing several roles within the team : His quest for a new arena finally happened in the summer of 2007 and, by 2010, the Amway Center opened. The Magic said the DeVos family contributed more than $100 million to those efforts. In 1949, he and friend Jay Van Andel took $49 and invested the modest amount into manufacturer and vitamin direct-seller Nutrilite. They became independent vitamin distributors and later used the company\u2019s person-to-person selling approach when starting Amway in Ada with an all-purpose household cleaning product. They coined the name Amway as an abbreviation of \u201cAmerican Way.\u201d Over five decades, Amway became a multibillion-dollar international corporation. Van Andel died in 2004. \u201cRich and my father built this company from the ground up, and in many ways Rich was the heart and soul of Amway,\u201d said Steve Van Andel, Amway\u2019s chair. \u201cHis vision and spirit inspired our employees and independent business owners for more than 50 years.\u201d Michigan\u2019s Republican governor described DeVos as \u201can incredible businessman, philanthropist and true Michigander.\u201d \u201cThe positive impact Rich had on our state is truly immeasurable,\u201d Rick Snyder said Thursday. \u201cThrough successful business ventures and charitable endeavors, he created endless opportunities for residents of many different ages and backgrounds. Rich\u2019s giving spirit is how we will always remember him, and his legacy is certain to live on forever.\u201d Amway was not without controversy. The Federal Trade Commission charged in 1969 that the company was an illegal pyramid scheme, but ruled after a six-year investigation that it wasn\u2019t. Amway also has been controversial because of its almost evangelical zeal in promoting free enterprise, and gained attention with DeVos\u2019 and Jay Van Andel\u2019s high-profile participation in Republican politics. DeVos was a major supporter of the Republican Party and was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Presidential Commission on AIDS in 1987. DeVos and his late wife, Helen, also donated to Christian churches and ministries and various other causes through their Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation. DeVos also supported Grand Valley State University in Allendale. In the 1970s, he served on its governing board. He later became president of the university\u2019s foundation board. \u201cRich gave so much of himself to Grand Valley. His enthusiasm and vision were contagious, and drew the entire community together to help provide a world-class education to West Michigan citizens,\u201d Grand Valley State President Thomas J. Haas said in a written statement. DeVos and Van Andel also helped revitalize downtown Grand Rapids, and many buildings and institutions in the city bear the names of the men or their company.  DeVos graduated from Grand Rapids Christian High School and attended Calvin College. He served from 1944-46 in the U.S. Army Air Corps. His son, Dick, is married to Betsy DeVos, who was appointed Education Secretary by President Donald Trump. He is also survived by three other children, two sisters and a number of grandchildren. Services have not been finalized. An award-winning, inspirational speaker, he motivated hundreds of thousands of independent business owners worldwide and kept a full schedule of speaking engagements for a variety of business and charitable organizations across the country. A self-proclaimed \u201ccheerleader,\u201d he promoted the values of freedom, family, faith and philanthropy in books plus thousands of speeches and interviews around the world. As a reflection of his strong Christian faith, he was known for introducing himself at speaking engagements as \u201cjust a sinner saved by grace.\u201d Mr. DeVos wrote five books: BELIEVE! (1975), Compassionate Capitalism (1993), Hope From My Heart (2000), Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive People (2008), and Simply Rich (2014). Simply Rich is a memoir reflecting on his work, faith, family, and the core values he held onto from his humble, Christian upbringing through his success as co-founder of Amway. DeVos was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Helen, and is survived by their children and spouses Dick and Betsy, Dan and Pamella, Cheri, and Doug and Maria; grandchildren and their spouses Rick and Melissa, Elissa and Nate, Andrea and Michael, Ryan, Cassandra and Heath, Sydney and Andrew, Cole, Hannah, Katie, Ben, Jessa, Addie, Dalton, Micaela and Jordan, Monreau, and Olivia; and great-grandchildren Clara, Sloane, Remington, Richard, Wilhelmina, Aurelia, Taggart, and Riven. He is also survived by two sisters, Bernice Heys and Janice (Bob) Courts.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  Sacramento Kings 2017-18 Record:  27-55, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Marvin Bagley III (Draft), Ben McLemore (trade), Deyonta Davis (trade), Nemanja Bjelica (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Garrett Temple, Vince Carter The lowdown: The playoff dry spell hit 12 years for a franchise still chasing its tail. Last summer, the Kings tried to mix a few oldies into a young core in order to be more competitive, but it mainly backfired. While Zach Randolph brought some grit and served as an example, George Hill pouted almost from the time the ink dried on his contract and was dealt to Cleveland at the trade deadline . Carter was an inspirational role player \u2026 and one far from his peak days. The Kings lacked a volume scorer and go-to savior in the pinch and that proved costly on many nights. More troublesome was slow or stagnant growth among former first-round picks Willie Cauley-Stein, Skal Labissiere and Justin Jackson. On the plus side, rookies Bogdan Bogdanovic and De\u2019Aaron Fox had moments. But once again, the Kings were focusing on their future and not their present. The Kings decided against making major changes, choosing to be patient with the up-and-comers, and Sacramento fans had no choice but to follow along. At this point, what\u2019s one more year of player development, anyway? Their offseason boiled down to getting Bagley III in the Draft and trying to poach Zach LaVine from the Bulls , and one out of two ain\u2019t bad. Armed with salary cap space (because of all the rookie contracts on the roster), the Kings gave LaVine a four-year, $78 million offer sheet that was eventually matched by the Bulls. It was a bold move by Sacramento and the number they threw at LaVine was rich, but an overpay is perhaps the only way for them to get a restricted free agent. Had the Bulls declined to match, you wonder where LaVine would\u2019ve fit on a team trying to groom Bogdanovic and Buddy Hield as scorers. Maybe it didn\u2019t make much sense, but the Kings are in the business of collecting talent (as opposed to the past, when they didn\u2019t collect much of anything \u2014 except grief). Sacramento had to settle for a return by McLemore, their former No. 1 pick ( No. 7 overall in 2013 ) whose true value to the Kings is his expiring contract and the additional second-round Draft pick the Kings received from Memphis in the deal . The summer really was about drafting Bagley III, someone the Kings hope becomes the cornerstone of a turnaround. He\u2019s their highest pick since they took DeMarcus Cousins at No. 5 in 2010 . He brings the goods that, at the very least, seem to suggest Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic \u2014 the Sacramento braintrust \u2014 didn\u2019t botch this decision. Their choice was either Bagley III or Luka Doncic and the Kings went for a 6-foot-11 post player who does a bit of everything well enough. For his size, he handles the ball reasonably well, shoots with decent range and moves fluidly. More than anything, Bagley III was arguably the best non-NBA teenager in the country the last two years \u2014 first as a high school senior and then a Duke freshman. The problem is this franchise has a history of face-palming when it comes to the Draft. You know the names by now: Thomas Robinson, McLemore, Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Georgios Pappagiannis and of course the unforgettable Jimmer Fredette. They are all lottery picks the Kings have taken since nabbing Cousins. Two (Pappagiannis and Fredette) are no longer in the NBA and none lasted more than three years in Sacramento (Cauley-Stein is on the clock). The players the Kings passed on? Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LaVine, Miles Turner, Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. Of course, in the case of some of the above (Antetokounmpo, Booker and Mitchell) several other teams missed the boat as well. But still, the Kings make a habit of that. They couldn\u2019t afford to whiff again in 2018. Sacramento is hoping Randolph teaches Bagley III the ropes and, by midseason, he, Fox and Bogdanovic become an exciting and productive trio. The summer also produced a bonus: a Harry Giles sighting. Giles was a first-rounder in 2017 but didn\u2019t play while mending from injury. There was no need to rush Giles along and instead Sacramento wisely let him heal up and get stronger. The covers came off at NBA Summer League and the plan appeared to pay off. Giles looked healthy, confident and impressive. The only \u201cproblem\u201d is Giles plays the same power spot as Bagley III (who can also play center). But the Kings must stockpile talent and worry about later fitting it together later. They\u2019d welcome any scenario where Giles and\/or Bagley III are in the running for the 2018-19 All-Rookie team. At some point, when you collect lottery picks at the rate of the Kings, one of those players will become what this franchise craves. The odds say so, anyway. The Kings are banking big on Bagley III because, if nothing else, they have no other choice.

According to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania ( via Twitter ) and Tim Reynolds of The Associated Press , the Heat and Haslem have agreed on a one-year, veteran\u2019s minimum deal that will keep Haslem with the Heat. Here\u2019s more from Reynolds on the reported pact between the sides : Heat president Pat Riley said in mid-August that the team and Haslem were moving toward an agreement on a contract .  Haslem\u2019s role for Miami has steadily diminished over the last three seasons and in 2017-18, he logged career lows in minutes (5.1 per game), points (0.6), rebounds (0.7) and field goal percentage (20.0). But his voice in the locker room is vital. The 38-year-old Miami native remains one of the team\u2019s captains, and it\u2019s not uncommon for him to mentor teammates on the bench during games or raise his voice at halftime \u2014 even before coaches enter the room \u2014 when things are not going to his liking. \u201cUD is always the guy who sets the standard for teammates,\u201d Heat point guard Goran Dragic said. Undrafted in 2002, Haslem spent his first pro season in France before signing with the Heat as a free agent in 2003. He is Miami\u2019s career leader in rebounds with 5,711 , and has appeared in 844 regular-season games \u2014 33 shy of Wade\u2019s record. He\u2019s also seventh on the Heat scoring list (6,486 career points). Among active players, only the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Dirk Nowitzki and the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Manu Ginobili have spent the entirety of a career spanning at least 15 years with one franchise. Former Spurs guard Tony Parker had also logged at least 15 years with the team, but left San Antonio this summer in free agency to sign with the Charlotte Hornets . Haslem has played with 126 different Heat teammates, not even counting those players who were signed for training camps and never actually appeared in a regular-season or playoff game. His return for a 16th year means that he\u2019s now been with the franchise for more than half its history; the Heat had played 15 seasons before he signed with them in 2003.

Nowitzki was shut down in early April to have minor surgery on his left ankle . Eddie Sefko of the Dallas Morning News reports that Nowitzki has gone through scrimmage with his teammates as the team prepares for the opening of training camp on Sept. 21. Sefko reports numerous Mavs have returned to Dallas in recent days, with Doncic and veteran guard J.J. Barea were among those to participate in the scrimmage. The Mavs re-signed the 13-time All-Star this summer after they declined a team option on his contract at the start of free agency to create more salary cap room to add Jordan. The 40-year-old forward averaged 12.0 points (on 40.9 percent shooting from 3-point), 5.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists during 77 games this season \u2014 his 20th in the NBA.

This year\u2019s inductees include giants of the game, from world champions in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s leagues, to Olympic gold medalists and coaches who have revolutionized the sport. However, there\u2019s one person who stands out to me both on paper and, more importantly, as a human being.  Rick Welts. Many of you reading this are probably wondering who I am and how the heck I\u2019m relevant enough to be writing a letter about a soon-to-be Hall of Famer. Honestly, I\u2019m asking myself that same question. You see, I\u2019m not a former NBA player or high-ranking executive. I\u2019m a normal person who was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time when Rick Welts decided it was time to start the final chapter of his career by taking a job with the underdog Golden State Warriors in 2011. That\u2019s when my life changed.   I had been with the Warriors for two-plus seasons at that time. Many fans only know the Warriors as the dynamic franchise they are today with outstanding leadership, championship pedigree and a global presence. However, when the Warriors offered me my first real job out of college in 2009, the organization was vastly different than it is today. After my first two seasons, Joe Lacob and Peter Guber purchased the team for a then-record price and that\u2019s when everything changed for me. Like any good leaders, Joe and Peter waited a full season before making the prominent managerial changes that most of us thought were inevitable. At that point, I suddenly became a \u201cfree-agent\u201d without a VP, department or boss. I was asked to fill in as the temporary EA (executive assistant) to the owner and interim president that summer while they figured out a long-term plan. A few months later, I remember sitting at my desk and overhearing our interim president chatting with our VP of marketing about someone named Rick Welts. He said we needed to make sure Rick had an assistant on day one when he arrived for his introductory press conference. They went back and forth about who could fill this role with the team\u2019s new president. Do we hire someone from the outside? Do we see if he wants to bring an assistant with him from a previous stop? This was a big hire and we needed to get it right. A seemingly easy decision about who\u2019s going to assist the new president was not as easy as it seemed given the current state of the organization. I remember sitting at my desk as they went back and forth, tossing various names out at random. At that point, I stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d I honestly had no idea what I was doing or asking for, really, but I did know one thing: I needed a job. As a fill-in until they found a full-time person, I couldn\u2019t afford not to try and, literally, I just stuck my neck out. With a complete lack of options to explore, they agreed to let me do it. Immediately, I sat back down at my desk and began researching \u201cRick Welts\u201d as if he was the topic of my senior thesis. I was 25 years old and stepping into a role for which I had zero experience. I quickly realized after the first Google search that I couldn\u2019t mess this up. His resume blew me away. Rick Welts was extremely accomplished, I remember saying to myself. All of the incredible things that will lead him to the Hall of Fame this weekend were listed on every single search I did: his creation of NBA All-Star weekend, his marketing prowess behind the \u201cDream Team,\u201d his involvement in the launch of the WNBA and, most recently, his front page story in The New York Times (becoming the highest ranking executive in sports to come out ). I was intimidated and excited all at the same time. How lucky am I to have the opportunity to work with this man? Even if he decides to replace me with a more permanent hire down the road, I\u2019m going to make sure I do everything in my power to earn his trust and confidence. His first day in the office \u2014 September 27, 2011 \u2014 was the beginning of something special and, unquestionably, the launching pad to the best years of my life. Rick Welts walked into the Warriors practice facility that day for his introductory news conference and my life has never been the same. I learned very quickly that Google searches can only tell you so much about a person. They provide you the facts \u2014 the accomplishments listed on a resume \u2014 and that\u2019s about it. They don\u2019t tell you what a person is made of or about their character and class.  After nearly seven years working with him, I think I\u2019m more than qualified to share many of the things that Google didn\u2019t about Rick Welts, my Hall of Fame boss. Rick gave a 25-year old girl a chance. He inherited this inexperienced kid as his Executive Assistant and believed in me, even when, quite possibly, I didn\u2019t believe in myself. And, he enabled my role to grow into so much more. During those first few days in my new surroundings with Rick, I answered countless calls from people throughout the sports community \u2014 from other teams, the NBA office, former players and employees, all saying the exact same thing: Rick Welts is the absolute best. You\u2019ve hit the jackpot. We love him.  And now I know why. Rick Welts is not just a Hall of Fame businessman, he\u2019s a Hall of Fame person. Former UCLA coach John Wooden once said, \u201cthe true test of a man\u2019s character is what he does when nobody\u2019s looking.\u201d If I didn\u2019t know any better, I would think he was talking about Rick.  Rick is one of the most respected executives in all of sports, and yet the most humble and caring person I have ever had the pleasure to know, let alone work for each day. Rick is the first person to jump in the back seat of the car when riding to a meeting with others. He doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s the most senior-ranking person in the car. Titles and rank don\u2019t matter to him. Decency does. He never asks things of people that he can\u2019t do for himself. To this day, I don\u2019t think I can tell you what his favorite lunch meal consists of because he NEVER asks me to get him anything unless there\u2019s a scheduling emergency. In that case, he\u2019ll simply say, \u201cpick up whatever is easiest for you.\u201d He still writes hand-written thank you notes \u2014 and a lot of them! It\u2019s a lost art in today\u2019s world of texts and emails, but Rick, conservatively, writes 8-10 notes per week and takes the time to acknowledge the birthday reminders on his calendar with a phone call. He is often the quietest person in a meeting, but is always listening. He never cancels a meeting because he\u2019s too tired, too busy or simply just doesn\u2019t want to do it. With our recent stretch of good fortune with the Warriors and long playoff runs, there have been countless 2 a.m. arrivals after a series on the road and Rick will still be the first person in the office, not one to be late for his 8:30 meeting. In fact, late isn\u2019t an option for Rick. He cares about people\u2019s schedules and always makes time for them. I\u2019ve never seen him usher someone out of his office when they knock on his door, busy as he may be. He just doesn\u2019t do it.   He\u2019s reached the mountaintop of his profession, but still stops every night on his way into Oracle Arena to give Nanette, the security guard, a hug and always checks in with Nenea at the check-in podium to see how she\u2019s doing. He\u2019s the first one to compliment someone for an award, usually in front of that person\u2019s peers, making them feel extra special. He genuinely cares for people. Sure, that sounds simple, but the fact of the matter is, it\u2019s rare, especially in high-pressure business, particularly in sports. Rick is unique and so richly deserves this moment on Friday night. Our world needs more leaders with big hearts and small egos. I\u2019m lucky to say that since that infamous day in 2011 when I blindly yelled \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I\u2019ve worked for someone who might have the biggest heart of them all.   Thank you, Rick. Thank you for making me feel special and setting the bar so high for everyone who has had the pleasure of working with you. Congratulations on your induction into the Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2018. You are so much more than what Google told me and now, fittingly, you are poised to be positioned among the elite of the elite, right where you belong. * * * Shari Knight has worked for the Golden State Warriors since 2009, most recently as Executive Assistant to Team President & Chief Operating Officer Rick Welts."},{"id":38824,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-minnesota-timberwolves-interested-luol-deng","date":"2018-09-05","title":"Reports: Minnesota Timberwolves showing interest in veteran Luol Deng","content":" The Minnesota Timberwolves may soon ramp up their pursuit of former All-Star forward Luol Deng. According to The New York Times \u2018 Marc Stein ( via Twitter ) and Shams Charania of The Athletic ( via Twitter ), the Wolves have eyes for the 14-year NBA veteran. Stein reports the Wolves plan to pursue Deng, who cleared waivers and became a free agent earlier this week. Charania reports the team and Deng will meet within the next week to discuss a potential deal. Last week, the Los Angeles Lakers waived Deng , just over two years after signing him to a four-year, $72 million free-agent contract. The Lakers didn\u2019t disclose the details of a probable buyout with Deng, but they announced the move on the first day in which the final season of Deng\u2019s mammoth deal could be stretched over a three-season span of the Lakers\u2019 cap limit. Although Deng was the Lakers\u2019 highest-paid player last season, he essentially wasn\u2019t part of the team. He appeared in the season opener before dropping out of the rotation and eventually spending long stretches away from the Lakers. He played in one game last season, scoring two points in 13 minutes. In 2016-17, Deng played in 56 games (with 49 starts), averaging 7.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game in 26.5 minutes per game. Deng\u2019s best years in the NBA came when he was a member of the Chicago Bulls playing under coach Tom Thibodeau \u2014 who is now the Timberwolves coach. Minnesota already has some Thibodeau-era Bulls on its roster, including guards Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose as well as forward Taj Gibson. Deng played for the Bulls from 2004-14 before being traded by Chicago to the Cleveland Cavaliers . The two-time All-Star Deng felt he didn\u2019t fit well into Lakers coach Luke Walton\u2019s up-tempo system, and he apparently declined to rejoin the rotation when the Lakers were slowed by injuries. He requested a buyout or a trade, but the Lakers found no takers and didn\u2019t want to absorb the salary-cap constraints of waiving him last season. Deng\u2019s departure and contract stretch should sharply increase the Lakers\u2019 available cap room by roughly $12 million for next summer, when they hope to add a second superstar on a maximum contract to join LeBron James.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Orlando Magic 2017-18 Record:  25-57, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Coach Steve Clifford, Mo Bamba (Draft), Jerian Grant (trade), Jarell Martin (trade), Timofey Mozgov (trade) Who\u2019s gone:  Coach Frank Vogel, Mario Hezonja, Bismack Biyombo, Shelvin Mack The lowdown:  The misery continues for the Magic, even after the Dwight Howard era went up in flames six years ago . Orlando hasn\u2019t made the playoffs since then and more depressingly hasn\u2019t gained significant traction over that span, either. The club seems stuck in a perpetual rebuilding holding pattern, still trying to get it right, still in search of a star to replace Howard. To date, the Magic lack a true franchise player despite cashing in multiple lottery picks, although Aaron Gordon finally showed signs of being a borderline star by improving his shooting range (33 percent from deep). Troubled by years of questionable trades, Drafts and free-agent signings, the Magic showed deficiencies at almost every position. Their 2017-18 season was doomed by an early-season stretch that saw them lose 15 of 16 games as they again fell into the depths of the Eastern Conference standings. A second offseason under new brain trust John Hammond and Jeff Weltman saw the Magic change coaches and use their lottery pick on a raw center. And while nobody in Orlando is raising visions of the playoffs for next season, it could be a start of stability and growth \u2014 something Orlando has lacked since the Howard and coach Stan Van Gundy days. Orlando\u2019s No. 1 pick was used on Bamba , a bouncy, athletic seven-footer whose wingspan stretches from Pensacola to the Keys. Bamba arrives already somewhat polished as a shot blocker. In today\u2019s NBA \u2014 where offense is mainly concentrated at the 3-point stripe and the rim \u2014 the value of defensive big men who can shadow the basket remains at a premium. His offensive instincts and footwork need polish as the late-blooming Bamba spent just one year in college at Texas. Bamba, 20, has time to grow into his game and is already more advanced than former Magic center Bismack Biyombo. The Magic are buzzing about a frontline of Bamba and the 6-foot-10 Jonathan Isaac (who was Orlando\u2019s top pick in 2017 ). If these guys click, they\u2019ll be a combo forevermore known as \u201cMo-Jo.\u201d Limited to 27 games his rookie season because of injuries, Isaac did impressive work in NBA Summer League play and elevated expectations. Clifford becomes Orlando\u2019s fifth coach overall since Van Gundy as the Magic have seemingly spent their time since then spinning their wheels. Vogel\u2019s Pacers teams of the early 2010s stared down LeBron James and the Heat\u2019s Big Three. But the, ahem, magic didn\u2019t follow him to Orlando. The new coach arrives off a somewhat turbulent season in Charlotte where Clifford dealt with health issues (taking a leave of absence) and oversaw a Hornets team that was a mild disappointment. One could argue neither was Clifford\u2019s fault, and anyway, Hammond and Weltman favored his communication skills and basketball acumen. Clifford\u2019s hiring didn\u2019t raise many eyebrows around the NBA. He was well-liked in the Charlotte locker room and apparently convinced Orlando that his health issues shouldn\u2019t be a concern. Another order of business was with Gordon, a restricted free agent and someone the Magic wanted to keep. Gordon cashed in despite a somewhat tight market for free agents, getting four years and $84 million to stay, which was his preference. It\u2019s a steep price for someone who hasn\u2019t lifted Orlando from the lottery or fits a true frontcourt spot, but Gordon is just touching his prime years and could be flexing for a breakout. With Gordon, Isaac and Bamba on the front line, Orlando is giddy about this potential foundation. This could finally be the core the Magic will use to return to relevance. Meanwhile, the Magic weren\u2019t so generous with another former lottery pick . Hezonja was projected as the team\u2019s swingman of the future, especially after Orlando lost patience with Victor Oladipo and traded him two years ago (oops). Hezonja only teased Orlando with his potential and, in free agency, opted to sign with the Knicks . They also erased one of their bigger mistakes by dumping Biyombo in a three-team deal . During the NBA\u2019s wasteful summer of 2016, they gave Biyombo four years and $72 million based on one good playoff series he had that spring vs. Cleveland, where he grabbed 26 rebounds in one game . In Orlando, Biyombo\u2019s flaws resurfaced and the center barely cracked the rotation, averaging just 20 minutes, six points and six rebounds a game. The Magic also swung deals for Grant and Mozgov. Those were mainly done as a salary-cap shell game, although Grant could play his way into a supporting role at point guard. This is roughly the third rebuild attempt by the Magic since Howard left. Orlando is proof that pressing the reset button doesn\u2019t always come with guarantees or a turn-the-corner deadline. Only proper Draft decisions combined with front-office stability can foster a rapid rebuild. That didn\u2019t exactly happen here. Once again, there\u2019s a plea for patience in Orlando, where loyal fans are rightfully wondering: Will they get it right this time?

As the Boston Celtics gear up for that date, coach Brad Stevens is anticipating his entire team will be ready to go come Sept. 25. Stevens was at the annual ABCD Hoop Dreams charity event at TD Garden last night and said he has been told that everyone \u2014 including injured stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward \u2014 will be available when training camp opens . \u201cI\u2019ve been told that everybody is going to be ready to go,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a great opportunity to start afresh with a brand new team, though we do have a lot of guys back, and see if we can be the best version of ourselves.\u201d Irving and Hayward missed 22 and 81 games, respectively, with injuries last season. Irving missed the final 15 games of the 2017-18 season and the entire playoffs to repair his left knee. Hayward suffered a gruesome ankle injury just five minutes into his Celtics debut after defecting from the Utah Jazz via free agency last summer. Stevens has kept tabs on Hayward\u2019s progress and says he expects him to be fully cleared to practice soon. \u201cHe looks good,\u201d Stevens said of Hayward. \u201cI saw him a couple of weeks ago in San Diego. I went out there and watched him work out. He looked really good. Then, two weeks or three weeks later, seeing him again \u2026 you can\u2019t tell anything from my untrained eyes. He looks good. He\u2019ll be cleared to go some 5-on-5 here very, very, very soon.\u201d Hayward has documented his injury rehab process and workouts via social media and said earlier this summer on his web site that he hoped to be participating in full-court, 5-on-5 workouts by late July .  Additionally, backup center Daniel Theis is on the mend as well. Theis missed the Celtics\u2019 playoff run with a season-ending knee injury , robbing Boston of a key frontcourt contributor in the postseason. \u201cDaniel was in the gym this morning, he looks great.\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe has not been cleared for 5-on-5 play yet, but the anticipation is he will by the start of training camp on Sept. 25.\u201d Late last month, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge told ESPN he expected the Celtics to be at full health when training camp opens . Boston suffered minimal offseason roster losses among its key rotation players as only center Greg Monroe ( who signed with Toronto ) and guard Shane Larkin ( who will be playing in Turkey ) won\u2019t be back for 2018-19. That roster continuity likely means changed roles for some players next season, something Stevens is hoping his players can take in stride. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a really good locker room,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret to anybody that there\u2019s only 240 minutes in a game. If we all struggle with that, more than just the human nature if you get taken out \u2014 that\u2019s OK, that\u2019s part of it \u2014 but if we all struggle with that, then we won\u2019t be very good. If we don\u2019t, then we\u2019ll have a chance to be pretty good.\u201d Stevens said he hasn\u2019t thought much about who will start vs. who will serve in a reserve role. Instead, he pointed to the willingness of last season\u2019s roster to accept roles to foster success \u2014 which was evident throughout Boston\u2019s playoff run. Despite the loss of their starting backcourt, the Celtics still advanced to the Eastern Conference finals , falling to the Cavaliers in seven games. \u201cYour rotation can change in a heartbeat,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou can work all summer on it and then you\u2019ve got to adjust in one day. The bottom line is we have an idea of who we\u2019ll play together and who best fits together and what lineups we think we\u2019ll try to use, but we\u2019ll see how it shakes itself out.\u201d"},{"id":38815,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-kaepernick-nike","date":"2018-09-05","title":"LeBron James says he 'stands with Nike' in reference to Colin Kaepernick","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Clutching his young daughter in his arms, LeBron James said on Tuesday that he \u2018stands with Nike,\u2019 a clear reference to the company\u2019s Colin Kaepernick ad campaign.

The evening culminated in the reveal of the latest LeBron James Nike basketball shoe: a women\u2019s sneaker designed by three female African-American designers and inspired by strong African-American women. In emotional remarks, James paid tribute to the three women in his life \u2013 his mother, wife and 3-year-old daughter, Zhuri. He noted how his mother had raised him alone, and given him \u201da sense of pride, a sense of strength, a sense of no worry.\u201d \u201dBecause of you, Gloria James, I\u2019m able to be in a position today where I can give back and showcase why I believe African-American women are the most powerful women in the world.\u201d He called his daughter \u201dmy rock.\u201d \u201dPeople always told me if you ever have a girl, she\u2019ll change you,\u201d James said. \u201dI was like, nobody\u2019s changing me, I\u2019m a man.\u201d But she did, he said. \u201dNot only did she change me, she\u2019s made me a better person,\u201d James said. \u201dA more dedicated person, a stronger person, I guess a more sensitive person.\u201d Closing his remarks, he said he stood \u201dfor anybody who believes in change.\u201d He added: \u201dI stand with Nike, all day, every day.\u201d The new endorsement deal between Nike and Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, launched vigorous debate on Tuesday as some fans expressed displeasure over the apparel giant\u2019s support of a player known for starting a wave of protests among NFL players against police brutality, racial inequality and other social issues. Some angry fans were even burning and cutting out the signature swoosh logos on their gear \u2013 and posting the results on social media. But Kaepernick and his Nike campaign, which marks the 30th anniversary of Nike\u2019s \u201dJust Do It,\u201d received plenty of support from the fashion world in attendance Tuesday. Bethann Hardison, an activist for diversity in fashion and a former supermodel who was also honored Tuesday, said she was happy with Nike\u2019s move. \u201dIt\u2019s such a divided situation in our world right now,\u201d she said of the negative reaction by some fans. \u201dBut I\u2019m such a huge, huge, wholeheartedly, supporter of Colin that I\u2019m very proud that someone understands what he\u2019s done and (is giving) him some kudos.\u201d Prominent African-American designer Tracy Reese said she loved the new Nike campaign. \u201dIt was tastefully done,\u201d she said. \u201dAnd really, this is the time to stand up for what you believe in. Colin Kaepernick has done that and I think that we need to follow his example and really go where the heart leads, instead of where everybody expects you to go.\u201d Also honored Tuesday were designer Dapper Dan and stylist Jason Rembert.

With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Atlanta Hawks 2017-18 Record:  24-58, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Coach Lloyd Pierce, Trae Young (Draft), Kevin Huerter (Draft), Omari Spellman (Draft), Jeremy Lin (trade), Justin Anderson (trade), Alex Len (free agency), Vince Carter (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Coach Mike Budenholzer, Dennis Schroder, Mike Muscala The lowdown:  Three years after winning a conference-best 60 games , the Hawks crash-landed and clearly set their sights on the Draft lottery by the 2018 All-Star break. New GM Travis Schlenk dumped Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilasova at the trade deadline and would\u2019ve shipped off a few more players if he could. Basically, Schlenk attempted to scrub most of the work of Budenholzer, who ran the basketball operation previously. John Collins made the All-Rookie team and Taurean Prince finished strong. However, Kent Bazemore \u2014 the club\u2019s highest-paid player \u2014 sputtered and never felt comfortable being a volume scorer ( 12.9 points per game ). The Hawks couldn\u2019t win or generate much interest in Atlanta, putting the framework for a fresh era in place well before 2017-18 ended. The Hawks held the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 Draft . Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III were off the board. What say you, Mr. Schlenk? He made a gutsy move, bypassing European sensation Luka Doncic in favor of Young and a 2019 protected first from the Mavericks. Schlenk admitted the Hawks\u2019 war room was evenly split on Doncic and Young, but the \u201919 first-rounder was the deal-maker. That\u2019s not an overwhelming vote of confidence for Young, and you wonder if Hawks ownership nudged Schlenk into making the deal because of Young\u2019s star potential. The organization dropped millions to give the newly-renamed State Farm Arena some bling over the last year and obviously crave a player with flair to move the needle in Atlanta. Young certainly brings a wow factor. He was the box office star at Oklahoma with his long-range shots and fancy passes. He also became the first collegiate player to lead the nation in scoring and assists in the same season. The Hawks say his ability to make teammates better is vastly unappreciated and will smooth his transition into the NBA. He also had a ragged second half of last season and became a social media punch line. His shot selection and accuracy raised red flags. In a sense, his final year at OU was a tale of two players: Tantalizing Trae and Tragic Trae. NBA scouts say Young\u2019s other drawbacks were his lack of size, athletic ability and defense. He was a polarizing Draft pick and the Hawks\u2019 decision received mixed reviews at best among Hawks fans. That additional first-round pick Atlanta got from Dallas could prove beneficial for a rebuilding team that wants to collect as many assets as possible. The idea of Young becoming an Atlanta Basketball Jesus seems like a reach \u2026 until you remember this franchise hasn\u2019t had a ticket-selling sensation in its history. Even Pete Maravich and Dominique Wilkins weren\u2019t basketball magnets in this college football-crazed town. With a new basketball regime in place, it was only a matter of time before Budenholzer, stripped of his basketball operations stripes, would bolt. Schlenk wanted his own people, which is standard operating procedure for a new GM. Once the season ended, Budenholzer began running off copies of his resume with the blessing of the Hawks. He landed in Milwaukee and Schlenk began searching for Budenholzer\u2019s successor. Eventually, Schlenk stayed in his comfort zone and hired Pierce. (Years ago, they both worked for the Golden State Warriors.) Pierce came with strong reviews for his work as an assistant coach, most recently with the Sixers . As a player, he rode shotgun in college at Santa Clara with Steve Nash and brings solid people skills to Atlanta. He is, however, a first-time coach and sometimes, it gets tricky when folks slide one seat over on the bench. It was no secret the Hawks wanted to jettison starting point guard and leading scorer Schroder this summer. He had legal issues and didn\u2019t develop solid chemistry with his teammates. When the Thunder agreed to a proposal, the Hawks pounced, sending Schroder to OKC for Carmelo Anthony (who was subsequently bought out ), Justin Anderson and a future first-rounder. Of course, this means the Hawks will either go with a rookie as their starting point guard or Lin (who\u2019s should be healthy for training camp after he missed all but one game last season.) With their additional first-round pick this year, the Hawks took Huerter, a sharp-shooter from Maryland. Right now they\u2019re getting nothing special offensively from the swing position and Huerter will get a long look as a rotational player. In order to help a young locker room adjust, the Hawks added 41-year-old Carter ( who was a rookie when Young was born ). Carter has become a lovable NBA senior citizen, which allows folks to overlook his declining skills. His veteran voice will help when the Hawks endure a losing streak. Still, the summer belonged to the deal the Hawks swung for Young. It\u2019s one of those decisions that could make Schlenk look like a genius, especially if he scores big on the 2019 Dallas pick and Young pans out. The flip side? Doncic becomes the transcendent star in Dallas that the Hawks craved. The final verdict on this deal won\u2019t be delivered for years. By then, will the Hawks be winners?

Trouble was, he recalled recently, his school at the time \u2013 the University of Massachusetts Amherst \u2013 offered courses in neither photography nor film. Not exactly a well-planned start to his chosen career.  So Bernstein transferred to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. And once the native of Brooklyn stepped off the plane into 85-degree sunshine, he was hooked. Thus began a professional path that has taken him around the world, yet kept him Los Angeles-centric as the NBA\u2019s senior photographer. A part-time job as an assistant to Sports Illustrated shooters helped Bernstein score his first NBA gig as a photographer the 1983 All-Star Game at L.A.\u2019s famous Forum. He\u2019d eventually serve as team photographer for the city\u2019s Dodgers, Lakers, Clippers and Kings, but it was in his work for the NBA that Bernstein made his greatest mark. In 1986, Bernstein helped create NBA Photos as the league\u2019s in-house licensing agency, for which he served as senior director until 2011. He chronicled Team USA through its 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympic championships, and has worked 36 NBA Finals and All-Star Games. Next month, his hardcover collaboration with Kobe Bryant \u2014 \u201cThe Mamba Mentality: How I Play\u201d \u2014 will hit bookshelves everywhere. This week as part of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, the 60-year-old photographer will be honored as a recipient of the 2018 Curt Gowdy Media Award. To shed light on his craft and share some behind-the-scenes tales, Bernstein \u2014 prior to heading to Springfield, Mass. \u2014 talked with NBA.com about some of his favorite and most famous images.  Details : Michael Jordan soars with several Lakers in futile pursuit at the 1988 Hall of Fame preseason game between Chicago and the Los Angeles Lakers at the Springfield Civic Center. Bernstein : \u201cIt was one of those crazy moments \u2014 in those days, I could only do one remote camera. Now I can do almost an infinite number because it\u2019s all done by radio. But back then, you had to hard-wire into the strobe [lighting] system for the big flashes, and you could only fire one. I chose the one shooting through the glass, behind the backboard. A lot of things could have gone wrong. His hand could have been in his face. He could have been out of the frame instead of just on the edge. I could only take one shot every four seconds [with the strobe] \u2014 it\u2019s not like I could lean on the motor drive and then pick one frame out of 10. \u2026 But it became known as \u201cCome Fly with Me.\u201d It did kind of define him at the time as being able to fly.\u201d Back story : Bernstein added: \u201cIf you have a microscope, you can actually see me on the other side of the court, sitting there with a little trigger button. Then there\u2019s the trivia question of all time \u2014 who\u2019s the other guy? That No. 3 happens to be [University of Virginia star and NBA role player] Jeff Lamp.\u201d  Details : Michael Jordan and his father, James, in the visitors\u2019 dressing room at the Forum, after Game 5 of the 1991 Finals. Bulls 108, Lakers 101. Bernstein : \u201cThe network would do the trophy presentation in the winning team\u2019s locker room, and the visitors\u2019 side at the Forum was about the size of a closet. That said, I loved that place. There seemed to be a thousand people in there, and all hell was breaking loose. I got up on top of a table in the middle of the room for a vantage point. When they came back live from a commercial, they wanted to have Michael on \u2014 but they couldn\u2019t find Michael. Some sixth sense said, \u2018Look to your left,\u2019 and there he was, in the locker, hugging that trophy, crying his eyes out with his dad next to him. I always felt, if he\u2019d had to play that whole season for free to get to the mountain top, he would have. I knew this was a special moment. I banged a couple of frames really quick.\u201d Back story : After James Jordan was murdered in 1993, Bernstein got a phone call from Michael\u2019s office saying he \u201cwould love it if I made a print and sent it to him,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cWhich I did. I was very close with my dad and Michael Jordan knew him \u2014 my dad was with me through the entire Dream Team experience [in 1992]. And I knew his dad. So it was a poignant moment in my career to have him request that photo. If I had to pick one photo to put on my tombstone, this would probably be it.\u201d  Details : Shot from a camera suspended in the rafters at the Forum, a Hasselblad 120mm with a 350mm lens. \u201cA heavy rig,\u201d Bernstein called it, anchored with multiple clamps and safety cables on the catwalk, aimed straight down. Bernstein : \u201cI love the composition of this photo and how everything just came together. The Forum had that beautiful Laker-gold \u2018key.\u2019 This was young Kobe, his first or second year, and he was a dunk machine back then. Look how he\u2019s cocked back like that and flying thorugh the air, the basket right there. All the elements came together. When I saw this the next morning \u2014 I had to take the film to the lab after the game, drop it off, then go back in the morning after sweating it out all night, hoping that I\u2019d see something like this \u2014 I was like, \u2018Wow!\u2019 All the preparation, hours and hours, setting the equipment up, and it all paid off.\u201d  Back story : It\u2019s not common to see the top of a player\u2019s head and the bottom of his sneakers in the same shot. Bernstein knew he had to share it and, thanks to the large-format film, he knew he could share it big. \u201cAs soon as I saw this,\u201d he said, \u201cI immediately made a giant print for Kobe \u2014 I mean, like 50 [inches] by 70. Huge. I framed it and drove it to his house. He was living with his parents in Pacific Palisades at the time. I hope he still has it. I had given players like Magic [Johnson] and whomever 8x10s, but I never had framed something I was super-proud of.\u201d  Details : Kobe Bryant, deep in his career, before a game against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden in January 2010. Bernstein : \u201cDuring a long East Coast trip, the Lakers had played the night before in Cleveland and were at the Garden less than 24 hours later. Kobe was banged up that year. This was an hour and a half to game time, and he was literally willing himself to play that night. Both ankles are in ice. He\u2019s got the finger in a little cup of ice. During my pregame routine, walking from the locker room to the training room, I just saw him there. Other guys were coming and going, but he was in this meditative state. I took one frame \u2014 God forbid the click of the camera disturb or distract him. Phil [Jackson] called this \u2018The Thinker,\u2019 like Rodin\u2019s sculpture.\u201d Back story : A skilled photographer learns how quickly how to be unobtrusive, a \u201cfly on the wall.\u201d Said Bernstein: \u201cYou have to, to get behind-the-scenes intimate photos of players away from the bright lights, and what goes on in the bowels of the arena or during travel. In 2009-10, Phil and I collaborated on a book called \u2018Journey to the Ring,\u2019 which took the Lakers from media day to whenever their season would end. They ended up winning it all that year, which was unbelievable for the project. The photos were in black-and-white, which was a conscious decision Phil and I made.\u201d  Details : Kobe Bryant and Andrew Bernstein before the 2016 NBA All-Star Game , Western Conference locker room at Toronto\u2019s Air Canada Centre. Bernstein : \u201cThis was his last All-Star Game and it was a true Kobe love-fest. I spent the entire weekend just with him, followed him everywhere he went. I mean, I didn\u2019t cover it like I normally do for the NBA, and NBA Photos was very generous for letting me cover it through him. It was a beautiful weekend. He took it all in and was very appreciative. His humility came out \u2014 a lot of people don\u2019t think Kobe is humble, but I think he was. And he was very grateful, that he had an impact on all these All-Stars who were grateful to him.\u201d Back story : The locker room was closed to the media, but as the league\u2019s guy, Bernstein always has special access. \u201cA couple of people were coming over to get photos with him \u2014 Gregg Popovich, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul and a couple others,\u201d the photographer said. \u201cAnd I just jumped in myself. Very, very rarely \u2014 I mean, four times in our 20 years together \u2014 did I jump in the picture with him. But I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d  Details : Another overhead shot at the Forum, this time during the 1991 Finals, with Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan fighting for what eventually will be a rebound. Bernstein : \u201cWith this angle, it\u2019s always a crap shoot what you\u2019re going to get. The rim could be blocking a guy\u2019s face. Somebody could be too far under the basket. The focus point is so critical \u2014 you have to be right on where it\u2019s focused. As for the shadows, if you can imagine lights in each corner of the court, way up high. It just depended on where the players were placed. If one of them is blocking the light on one side, you get a shadow off to the other side. It\u2019s always dramatic with the strobe. But just to get these two icons in the same frame was difficult.\u201d Back story : Just as the famous parquet court at Boston Garden looked so iconic on TV and from afar, the Forum was best viewed from a distance. The paint worn off the top of the rim by balls and hands was something few ever saw. \u201cThe Forum was a dump,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe walls were caked with dirt. Nobody ever cleaned it. They used to feed us under the stands where the rodents were. It was like a Hollywood impostor, and it\u2019s in Inglewood, which is not your glitzy Hollywood location. But they made it look good on TV. It was a tough place to work, I have to tell you. But I loved it.\u201d  Details : A fisheye lens captures the moments immediately after Game 5 of 2017 Finals , with Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry front and center. Bernstein : \u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at getting out and being the first guy in the scrum. When a championship is won, I sharpen my elbows and just go for it. I try to be right next to the TV guy and well, I guess people know me and I make my way to wherever I have to be. This particular time, I knew there had to be a moment in there where Curry and Durant had an interaction. And it was amazing \u2014 they\u2019re almost like one body. It\u2019s Kevin\u2019s first championship and Steph is so happy for him as his teammate. And the pressure that was on the whole team to win this championship. I love this picture. It shows so much about the way I work and how I think about what I need to do in the moment.\u201d Back story : Bernstein\u2019s camera captured Durant\u2019s mother Wanda to the left, crying and enjoying the moment. But a few seconds earlier, he said, \u201chis mom came up and grabbed him by the front of the jersey. She kept yelling, \u2018We did it! We did it!\u2019 That\u2019s a great picture too.\u201d  Details : Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson share a moment after beating the Magic in Game 5 and winning the 2009 NBA championship at Orlando\u2019s Amway Arena . Bernstein : \u201cIf you remember the 2008-09 season, there was a lot of pressure on Kobe. People had been saying that he couldn\u2019t win without Shaq, Phil had actually written that he was \u2018uncoachable.\u2019 But there\u2019s such a paternal father-son thing going on in this picture. \u2026 I know I\u2019ve got to go to the star player immediately at the buzzer. So I ran out and found Kobe. Phil and he had just come together and they were hugging, which is a nice picture. But I knew the instant after a hug can be just as special. Something told me to wait till after the hug \u2014 because [with the limitation of the strobe lights] I can\u2019t shoot rapidly \u2014 and bing ! They broke the hug and Phil\u2019s looking like, \u2018Job well done, son.\u2019 And Kobe has this amazing look of relief and sense of accomplishment and exhaustion.\u201d Back story : Bernstein said this is the only print of his work that his wife, Mariel, allows him to hang in their house. \u201cWe have three teenagers [at the time] who basically were the same age, all within a year of each other, and when all hell was breaking loose at our house, we\u2019d stand the kids in front of this photo. My wife and I would say, \u2018Look at that! If those two guys can get along and be respectful, we can do it in this house.\u2019 \u201d  Details : The Celtics\u2019 Larry Bird and the Lakers\u2019 Magic Johnson fight for rebounding position along the foul lane at Boston Garden in the 1987 Finals. Bernstein : \u201cThis is probably my most well-known image, other than the one of Jordan hugging the trophy. Remember, these guys played different positions. They never really matched up. You\u2019d never see Magic D-ing up Bird like you would with Michael or Isiah Thomas. And you\u2019d never, ever see Bird D-ing Magic. I had to be unbelievably conscious of when they were on the court together, where they were on the court and somehow, if they would end up in my frame. The only times, honestly, I could ever get them in the same frame was the \u2018captains\u2019 meeting\u2019 five minutes before tip at center court, shaking hands, and a free-throw situation. When, by the grace of God, they would line up facing me. That\u2019s what this was. Back story : Just as Bird and Johnson were linked literally, arm in arm, in this photograph, their careers were linked figuratively through the NBA of the 1980s. \u201cIt kind of defined the era,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThese two great guys intertwined, neither of them looking superior to the other. Jostling for position, just like the Celtics and the Lakers did. I love this picture, and I know both of those guys love it. This picture is hanging in the Hall of Fame.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team:  Dallas Mavericks. 2017-18 Record:  24-58, did not qualify for the playoffs Who\u2019s new:  Luka Doncic (Draft), Jalen Brunson (Draft), DeAndre Jordan (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  Nerlens Noel, Doug McDermott, Yogi Ferrell, Seth Curry The lowdown:  Did the Mavericks finally bottom out after winning the NBA title in 2011 ? Their fans certainly hope so, because a 24-win season was nothing to feel fuzzy about. They lacked toughness up front and often asked the great Dirk Nowitzki, in his 20th season, to bail them out at age 40. They did get promising returns from rookie Dennis Smith Jr. at times, but he shot 39.5 percent overall and failed to exceed his enormous hype (he was the Kia Rookie of the Year favorite in the 2017 NBA.com Rookie Survey ). Overall, the Mavericks found themselves a few notches below almost everyone else in a very tough Western Conference as their rebuilding process continued. (Even owner Mark Cuban thought his team last season was better off, in the long run, with a high Draft pick .) Either the Mavericks outsmarted everyone in the room during the Draft, or they just got played. Or perhaps what they did will prove to be nothing special. Either way, Dallas surrendered a 2019 top-five protected first-rounder to the Hawks in a Draft-night trade to get Doncic , the European basketball wonder kid who has been a professional for the last three-plus years. They saw an opportunity and jumped on it, so you must give Dallas props for being aggressive and going with its gut feeling to make something happen. The Mavs strongly believe Doncic is a game-changer and an ideal fit next to Smith Jr. in the backcourt \u2026 and there\u2019s good reasons for that. At 6-foot-8, Doncic brings size and a beyond-his-years wisdom to the NBA. With Real Madrid in Spain, the Slovenian was a wizard with the ball and in his decision-making. He saw the floor well, shot respectably from deep, made the right plays and took over games while in most cases being the youngest player on the floor. While lacking in supreme athleticism, his all-around fundamentally flashy game could transfer well to the NBA. And he earned all the important individual awards while leading his team to the Euroleague title. That equals hope in Dallas that Doncic will become at least the second-best player ever to come from Europe. They didn\u2019t want Young and likely would\u2019ve settled for Jaren Jackson Jr. had the Hawks turned down the deal. Dallas\u2019 gamble is with that conditional 2019 first rounder, which will likely be conveyed to Atlanta unless the Mavericks deliver another dreadful season. That seems unlikely, all because of the second-biggest Dallas transaction this summer. It\u2019s a wild coincidence that Jordan will play for the Mavericks after he infamously got cold feet in the summer of 2015 after verbally committing to Cuban and Co. for four years and $80 million. That renege went viral on social media and gave everyone a good laugh. Jordan opted out of his deal with the LA Clippers (he\u2019ll make the same cash this season in Dallas) as the Clippers were moving in a new direction and weren\u2019t planning on giving him a contract extension. Jordan \u2014 a Houston native and former Texas A&M star \u2014 is back in Texas, bringing his rebounding (15.2 per game last season), paint presence and lob-finishing mentality to satisfy the Mavs\u2019 weaknesses in those areas. Even in adding Jordan, the Mavericks kept their salary cap space for 2018-19 at a low level and should be big players on the free-agent market next summer. You can see the Mavericks\u2019 vision: Doncic has a strong rookie season and becomes a ball-sharer that everyone wants to play next to. Then, they sign a free agent or two next summer to rebuild the club into a contender in the near future. To have a pair of intriguing young players (Doncic and Smith Jr.) and some future cap flexibility seems like a good plan. They also grabbed Brunson with their second-round pick. Brunson helped Villanova to two NCAA titles and was largely considered the best pure point guard in college last year. He\u2019s crafty, pass-friendly, a true leader and a throwback point guard of sorts. What he does lack is great size and consistent shooting ability, although the latter can be improved. It\u2019s very possible that Brunson, the rare four-year college player, could be a steal. Rather than jeopardize their future cap space, the Mavs closed their wallet after getting Jordan and essentially told their own free agents to find new homes. McDermott went to the Indiana Pacers, Noel headed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, Curry landed with the Portland Trail Blazers and Ferrell picked the Sacramento Kings. While all of them had moments in Dallas, they were all seen as replaceable.  With a pair of promising additions and no real defections, the Mavericks scored, at the very least, an interesting offseason. Doncic and Jordan might not be enough to elevate the Mavericks into the playoff mix in 2018-19. But this team, after 24 wins, can\u2019t help but rise and may even see a double-digit win improvement. The real test comes next summer when Dallas must do it all over again, most likely without its No. 1 pick.

They didn\u2019t exactly get their hearts broken and Memphis still loves its only professional sports team. Yet their seven-year playoff streak ended rather ingloriously due to Mike Conley playing just 12 games because of heel surgery and Marc Gasol delivering a clunker of a season complete with a reported spat that cost David Fizdale his coaching job . The task of keeping the Grizzlies competitive was largely left to a batch of journeymen and unproven young players who simply didn\u2019t bring enough pop, mainly because they didn\u2019t have much of it to begin with. Memphis sifted through 24 players in all last season in an ambitious yet futile talent hunt. The whole year was a total write-off \u2026 or, as BB King would say, the thrill was gone. The good news, and Memphis needed plenty of that, was the Grizzlies held their highest selection in the Draft since 2009. The bad news is they took Hasheem Thabeet back then and he became an all-time face palm. The encouraging news is this time the Grizzlies spent the No. 4 on Jackson Jr. and they suspect, perhaps with good reason, that he could eventually wind up the best player in this Draft. That sounds rather ambitious, for sure, especially for a team with a poor Draft record. Yet the good vibes about Jackson Jr. are mainly due to a few reasons: he turns 19 this month and his base skill set is precisely what the NBA wants right now \u2014 a springy big man who swats shots and hits 3-pointers. The grand plan is for Jackson Jr. to pair up with Gasol to make the Grizzlies a tough matchup, given their size and shooting range. It\u2019s a reasonably sound idea, although the execution of it will be interesting. Gasol\u2019s scoring dipped to 17.2 points per game (after a career-high 19.5 ppg in 2016-17) and he fell from the group of elite centers. Jackson Jr. could understandably deal with NBA growing pains at some point. The Grizzlies also snatched Carter in the Draft when he lasted until the second round. Carter was a solid player and tenacious defender at West Virginia who locked up Trae Young late last season. He could press for time in the rotation as a backup to Conley, which should be his rookie ceiling. Beyond the Draft, the Grizzlies engaged in some tough decisions. One involved Evans, their leading scorer (19.4 ppg) and go-to guy by default . He had his best overall campaign since his rookie season and finally remained somewhat healthy. But he opted to sign with the Indiana Pacers this summer. Maybe they\u2019re bullish on up-and-comer Dillon Brooks and believe he can absorb those swingman minutes. But if that\u2019s the case, why didn\u2019t Memphis trade Evans before the deadline last season and get something for him instead of allowing him to leave for nothing? They also paid a reported $37 million over four years for Anderson , a restricted free agent whose offer wasn\u2019t matched by the Spurs. The consistent and cerebral Anderson might already be at his ceiling at age 24, and as a poor athlete, he hardly brings sizzle. The Grizzlies have had their fill of swingmen who can\u2019t score in bunches. What Memphis couldn\u2019t do this summer was make Chandler Parsons and his hernia-causing contract (two years, $49 million remaining) disappear. Given his injury history, dumping Parsons would\u2019ve certainly forced the Grizzlies to take back an equally bad contract (if one such exists) or package it with an asset. There were reports Memphis listened to offers for Parsons and the No. 4 pick before the Draft, but evidently none were good enough for the Grizz to pull the trigger. The Grizzlies also had a decision at coach and after some deliberation decided to remove the interim tag from JB Bickerstaff , who was elevated from assistant after Fizdale was fired. There was some thought around the league that Memphis would hire an experienced coach. But Bickerstaff is well regarded and has a solid relationship with Gasol and Conley. In all, it was the kind of summer the Grizzlies needed. Was the year spent in the lottery an aberration for the Grizzlies? Or is this the new normal? The West is plenty competitive with LeBron James in LA and fast-improving teams in other cities such as Denver. Based on what they did this offseason, the Grizzlies are hoping a mixture of young players (Jackson Jr., Anderson, Brooks) and the tried-and-true old guard (Conley, Gasol) will elevate them back among the living.

After their shortest playoff appearance in five years, injuries forced star guard Kevin Johnson to mull retirement while former NBA MVP Charles Barkley was asking for a trade (in his usual direct manner). It was a sobering time for a franchise just three years removed from faltering in The Finals . With no clear-cut solution presenting itself just yet, the Suns entered the 1996 NBA Draft armed with only the 15th and 43rd overall picks. Then-owner Jerry Colangelo knew who he wanted to get if the dominoes fell the right way. \u201cAs things were coming to a head at the Draft, Kobe Bryant was a player that we had considerable interest in,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cIt appeared to us that there was a great shot at him falling to us.\u201d Phoenix\u2019s longtime nemesis, however, also had its eyes on Bryant. The Lakers executed a trade with the Charlotte Hornets to move up in the Draft and take the high-school prospect, leaving the Suns with their original depth chart at No. 15. With Johnson\u2019s future in doubt and with promising young forward Michael Finley in tow, the Suns\u2019 next decision was an easy one. \u201cDespite who was up on the board in terms of position,\u201d Colangelo said, \u201cwe felt that the best player available to us was Steve Nash.\u201d Suns fans didn\u2019t agree. They booed the pick when it was announced. They only remembered the nondescript, 6-foot-3 guard from Santa Clara\u2019s trouncing of the University of Arizona in the 1993 NCAA Tournament.  \u201cI don\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to be a tremendous basketball player on appearance,\u201d Nash said good-naturedly after the Draft. \u201cI probably would\u2019ve booed myself too, but I\u2019m going to be a really good player and I\u2019m going to help the team a lot. I have a lot of faith in myself and hopefully they\u2019ll enjoy watching me play. While the Suns felt they had acquired a keeper in Nash, they were not necessarily expecting legendary stuff from the under-the-rim kid from Canada. \u201cAt that time, the Suns felt that Steve was a player they could bring along,\u201d remembers longtime Suns radio man Al McCoy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what his capabilities were going to be.\u201d Whatever Nash\u2019s abilities at the time, they weren\u2019t enough to blunt the trauma of the post-Barkley era. Phoenix\u2019s franchise face was gone, traded to the Houston Rockets for a package of lesser talented role players. The Suns\u2019 0-13 start to 1996-97 proved the team needed to find a new star to right the ship. Luckily for the Suns, one had just become available. The Dallas Mavericks hadn\u2019t been relevant in nearly a decade, and their woes were continuing well into \u201996-97. This was despite the presence of Jason Kidd, 23, who was fresh off his first All-Star season. The Mavericks were owned, managed and coached by an entirely new staff, one that felt a change in direction was needed. Phoenix leapt at the chance to acquire Kidd, who was just one year older than Nash and already an established star. They dealt Finley, Sam Cassell, A.C. Green and a second-round pick to get him.  The cost for Kidd was steep, but perhaps even more so for Nash. Despite Phoenix\u2019s propensity to play multi-guard lineup, Nash found it difficult to earn minutes behind Kidd, Johnson and Rex Chapman. By the end of the 1997-98 season, it was clear that Nash would remain a backup with the Suns. So when Nash approached Colangelo and asked for a better opportunity via trade, he couldn\u2019t help but understand. \u201cI think you have to capacity to do that Steve,\u201d Colangelo told him frankly. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d Less than two years after acquiring Kidd from Dallas, the Suns sent Kidd\u2019s backup to the Mavs in exchange for Pat Garrity, Martin Muursepp, Bubba Wells and a first-round pick that became future All-Star Shawn Marion. Nash may have known he had the talent to be a starter, but unearthing that talent on a starter\u2019s basis proved even harder than guarding Kidd and Johnson every day in practice. The burden was also physical, for Nash\u2019s back was beginning to experience the first throes of pain that would threaten him for the rest of his career. Mavericks fans reached their limit with their point guard of the future on March 24, 1999. For reasons they could not understand, Dallas had just signed Nash to a multi-year extension. This was despite the fact that Nash was averaging an abysmal 7.9 points per game on 36.3 percent shooting.  That night, against (of all people) Barkley and the Houston Rockets, Nash was booed by his own fans. Hard. Nash didn\u2019t understand any of it, including his own lack of success. \u201cBut I\u2019ve worked hard,\u201d Nash said afterwards . \u201cI really have. I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like that.\u201d The Mavericks, however, continued to back Nash and several of his former teammates knew they would be rewarded for that faith. \u201cWe had a glimpse. This guy was good,\u201d Johnson said . \u201cIf he could ever put it together out there on the court when he got minutes, it was going to be over.\u201d Slowly, it began to happen. Nash began using preventative exercises to keep his health intact. His efficiency increased. So did his production. By the end of the 2003-04 season, the former Suns backup and once-booed Maverick was a two-time All-Star, a fan favorite and a key reason behind Dallas\u2019 return to relevance. Now, Nash was also a free agent. In April of 1988, Colangelo was seated at a Board of Governors dinner that would change the fabric of the NBA. Then-commissioner David Stern was speaking, and the subject at hand was free agency \u2014 specifically, u nrestricted free agency. Colangelo, now 78, still recalls the tense energy in the room. He wanted to finish the overhaul he had started with his team just two months earlier, when he traded All-Star forward Larry Nance to the Cleveland Cavaliers for a package of players including Johnson and a first-round pick in the 1988 draft that became Dan Majerle . All he needed now was an established star to lift Phoenix from its longest playoff drought since the early 1970s. \u201cAs it was being discussed,\u201d Colangelo recalled, \u201cI just took a view of the room. I remember looking at Barry Ackerley, who was the owner of the Seattle SuperSonics. I just caught his eye for a moment. Almost instantaneously, I thought in the back of my mind, \u2018I\u2019m sorry Barry, but you just lost Tom Chambers.\u2019 \u201d Colangelo made good on that mental promise less than three months later when he, coach Cotton Fitzsimmons and assistant coach Paul Westphal put on one of the NBA\u2019s first-ever no-holds-barred free-agent recruiting pitches. \u201cAt the stroke of midnight, when it was officially possible to reach out, we were on the phone,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cWe were on our way to L.A. the next day. While I\u2019m there at [agent] Howard Slusher\u2019s home \u2013 he had also represented Paul Westphal, who was our coach \u2013 I basically said to Slusher, \u2018What do you want? I want him in Phoenix. What is it that you want and we have a contract.\u2019 \u201d Colangelo signed Chambers in \u201988, the first unrestricted free-agent signing in NBA history, and that move helped the Suns to a 27-game improvement in 1988-89 as they reached the West finals. Sixteen years later, Colangelo put on another full-court press for an established veteran he hoped would return the struggling Suns to their former glory. \u201cWhat stays the same [in free agency] is always the requirement to be aggressive,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cSecondly to be the first in the door. The early bird gets the worm, so to speak. But you need to be aggressive and stay on target. Those things are consistent.\u201d The Suns had kept their eye on Nash throughout the 2003-04 season. Much as they had the year before landing Chambers, Phoenix was struggling through an identity crisis. The Suns had talent in the versatile Marion and 21-year-old dunking machine\/Rookie of the Year winner Amar\u2019e Stoudemire. However, Kidd was long gone, and his replacement (Stephon Marbury) had been dealt in exchange for the cap space Phoenix was now preparing to use on a different guard altogether.  \u201cThere were two players that we had interest in in free agency,\u201d Colangelo remembers. \u201cSteve Nash and [Manu] Ginobili. But we felt that Ginobili for sure was going to stay in Stan Antonio. We had the relationship with Steve.\u201d That relationship had remained intact despite its six-year separation. Nash knew the Colangelos well as they had been the ones to Draft him. Phoenix had retained Chapman, a former Nash teammate, as a scout. Head athletic trainer Aaron Nelson had become fast friends with Nash during his first stint in the desert. Though they couldn\u2019t arrange to be the first through Nash\u2019s door (he allowed Dallas that courtesy), the Suns managed to be the first ones on the phone. Colangelo\u2019s call was first, expressing interest to Nash\u2019s agent. The second call was Chapman\u2019s, and he did get through the door first, albeit in an informal setting before negotiations set in on July 1. The Suns didn\u2019t mince words or man power. New owner Robert Sarver was in tow. So was general manager Bryan Colangelo. Throw in Chapman, Stoudemire and a plethora of other front office faces, and it was clear to Nash that his old team wanted him back. He wasn\u2019t sure the Mavericks felt the same way. His earlier meeting with them had produced a less-than-compelling contract offer , one he felt did not match his production, past or future. \u201cDallas was kind of hesitant and hadn\u2019t really stepped forward to the financial level that Steve was looking for,\u201d Sarver said. \u201cAs we spent the day with him, you could tell he felt good about coming back to Phoenix. We had a nice day with him. At the end he felt he had an obligation to Dallas and gave them a call for a last chance.\u201d The Mavericks remained conservative with their offer to Nash, who made at least one other important call as he wrestled with the decision. After a healthy amount of time that kept the Suns contingent on pins and needles, Nash walked back out to greet the biggest recruiting team of his basketball career. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a Phoenix Sun,\u201d he said simply. Over the next eight seasons, Nash and the Suns would make NBA history. The moment when each member of the 2004-05 Suns realized that season would be special depends on who you ask. \u201cIt was training camp,\u201d Stoudemire said. \u201cThat training camp was spectacular because the environment completely changed. You have great young players like myself, Joe Johnson, Shawn Marion, Leandro Barbosa\u2026 we had young guys that were ready to work. Steve fit right in, but to have a true point guard elevated the entire team.\u201d  \u201cWhen I really thought we probably turned the corner and had something special is when we got into the preseason games and were just dominating some teams,\u201d Sarver said. What he saw even in informal practices excited then-assistant coach Alvin Gentry, but he hesitated to buy in until the regular season. \u201cOnce the season started and we played about ten games,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWe would run and the other teams would get tired and we would just have these runs in the fourth quarter, very similar to what Golden State does in the third quarter now.\u201d Nash was at the center of every run, which was often since the Suns were running at a historic pace. They were also running in a way the league had never seen before. They had discarded the notion of starting a traditional center by using Stoudemire in that role. He and Nash became a nearly unstoppable pick-and-roll tandem, while shooters (like Johnson, Barbosa, Raja Bell and others) ran to the 3-point line instead of the rim for open shots on the fast break. The result was an offensive onslaught that changed the league. Phoenix was at or near the top of the league rankings every season in pace, 3-point shooting and Offensive Rating. That Nash was the engine of the Suns machine was impossible to ignore. \u201cSteve would just dissect the defense,\u201d Stoudemire said. \u201cHe always knew who was open, where that guy was, where he wanted the ball. We never had to talk about it.\u201d \u201cI was really, really fortunate to be the athletic trainer and have the front seat,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI watched Steve throw passes where I was like, \u2018What are you doing? Where he is throwing that to?\u2019 It would go right between two guys\u2019 heads right into the hands of Amar\u2019e. He made some of the most unbelievable passes.\u201d Colangelo still marvels at how Nash repeatedly surprised defenders and onlookers with the angles he was able to find. \u201cHe was a treat to watch,\u201d Colangelo gushed. \u201cTo see the combination of he and Stoudemire on the pick and roll was a treat. He continually surprised you with his ability to get things done on the floor the way that he did.\u201d  Volume is easier to appreciate than efficiency. Nash ranks third all-time in the NBA assist annals. Reminders are often needed that he is the career leader in free throw percentage (90.4 percent) and ninth all-time in 3-point accuracy (42.8 percent). That skill was a dream come true for Stoudemire \u2013 and a nightmare for opponents trying to defend what became the most feared pick-and-roll duo in the game. \u201cDefenses didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Stoudemire laughed. \u201cSteve was already such a good shooter. I rolled to the basket so fast, and if they tried to take my roll away, Steve had an open shot and he was a drop-dead shooter.\u201d Deadly his shot may have been, but it was never Nash\u2019s weapon of choice. Early on in his career \u2014 even during his MVP seasons \u2014 defenses would occasionally make a point of trying to make Nash score instead of pass. The ultimate case study occurred during the 2005 Western Conference semifinals, when Dallas almost encouraged Nash to a 48-point game \u2014 and a Game 4 loss . In Game 5, the newly minted NBA MVP wrenched the gameplan back to his control. After sinking a 3-pointer with 5.7 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime, Nash finished with a more acceptable 34 points \u2014 along with 13 rebounds and 12 assists . More importantly, Phoenix won the game (and eventually the series). \u201cHe was always capable of doing something,\u201d McCoy reflected. \u201cWhether he had to score, set up teammates for quick hoops \u2013 you just felt that the Suns always had the capability of winning the game no matter what was taking the place in the first three quarters.\u201d Nelson had vowed to keep Nash healthy, but he knew \u2014 as every trainer knows \u2014 that the athlete ultimately determines the ceiling of his or her physical well-being. For the 18-year head athletic trainer, that is what stands out most. \u201cHe knew he had to do extra work to make sure his back and everything was moving the way it needed to move,\u201d Nelson recalled. \u201cSome days the manual therapy and the stuff we were doing with him would go on for hours and would be extremely, extremely painful for him. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it. But he did what he had to do to play well.\u201d  Exercise and preventative therapy was just one part of it. Nash also took ownership of what went into his body. Food became a conscious and resolute decision. He cut out fried foods and synthetic sweeteners completely. In an effort to keep his basketball career as stable as possible, Nash incorporated balancing and core exercises into his routine. \u201cHe was the kind of guy that if his shot drifted a couple centimeters to the left, he would spend days trying to correct it,\u201d Nelson explained. \u201cHe just felt it was a body imbalance. That\u2019s how finely tuned he was into his game.\u201d The optimism surrounding the 2005-06 Suns was invested greatly in Stoudemire. The exclamation point to Phoenix\u2019s pick-and-roll was coming off an All-NBA season and averaged more than 37 points per game against Tim Duncan and the Spurs in the 2005 playoffs. Then Stoudemire felt knee soreness during training camp \u2014 and it didn\u2019t go away. A microscopic procedure revealed the need for microfracture surgery, an operation that sidelined Phoenix\u2019s leading scorer for the entire season . \u201cSteve told me, \u2018Just be strong. Take your time on the recovery. Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 \u201d Stoudemire said. Nash was even more supportive seven months later, when the pass-first Suns took on the NBA\u2019s leading scorer, Kobe Bryant, and the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the 2006 NBA playoffs. The Lakers\u2019 physicality and Bryant\u2019s patience nearly upset the second-seeded Suns, who found themselves mired in a 3-1 series deficit. After losing Game 4 on a Kobe Bryant buzzer-beater in overtime, Nash spoke to the team in the locker room. \u201cGuys\u2019 heads were down,\u201d Sarver said. \u201cEveryone was upset. Steve just stood up and said, \u2018Hey, you guys got about five minutes to get this out of your system. Then we\u2019re not going to talk about this game anymore. We\u2019re better than this team and we\u2019re going to go beat them three times in a row.\u2019 \u201d Led by Nash, Phoenix did. He scored 22 points in a Game 5 blowout and put up 32 points and 13 assists in Game 6 road win before the Suns cruised to a Game 7 victory at home. Two days later, he hoisted his second NBA MVP. \u201cThat\u2019s great leadership,\u201d Sarver said. \u201cIf we had any chance, that\u2019s what we needed.\u201d Nash\u2019s leadership was never more evident than during physical injury. When a collision with Tony Parker in the 2007 playoffs split his nose open, the two-time MVP stopped playing only when his heart rate kept preventing the blood from clotting sufficiently. When Nash broke his nose a few seasons later, he snapped it back into place himself while still on the court. When he chipped a tooth in a game, he tossed the broken piece to the training staff and played on. His most dramatic example, however, occurred during the 2010 playoffs against his long-time rivals in San Antonio . Nash\u2019s Suns teams had lost to the Spurs three times in the previous five years, but Phoenix had jumped out to a suspiciously easy 3-0 series lead. Surely quitting the San Antonio curse would be harder than this? Suns fans who wondered felt their hearts drop in the third quarter, when Nash found himself on the wrong end of a Tim Duncan elbow. The blow cut open the area above his right eye, causing it to bleed and swell almost immediately. The injury was serious enough to require a lidocaine injection. But Phoenix was only up single digits with a chance to finally vanquish the Spurs.  \u201cDoc, I don\u2019t want the injection,\u201d Nash said \u201cSteve, this is going to hurt a lot if I just sew it up without anything,\u201d the team doctor replied. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Nash insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back out there.\u201d And so, with his eye barely sewn together and nearly swollen shut, Nash posted 10 points and five assists in the fourth quarter to finish off San Antonio.  \u201cThat guy would play through anything for his guys,\u201d Gentry recalled fondly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask him to do anything more for you because he was already doing it.\u201d Most everyone liked Nash\u2019s game and work ethic, but those who knew him quickly grew to appreciate his personality. A few weeks after he was drafted, the team staged a photoshoot for its new rookie centered around his Canadian background: Nash in the full Suns uniform, complete with ice skates and a hockey stick. After the photo shoot, Nash dropped everything to indulge in a few full-speed laps around rink, terrifying team employees who feared he would get injured on their watch. Former Suns coach Mike D\u2019Antoni fell victim to that fear during a game against Oklahoma City. Nash had sprained his ankle and went to the locker room to get it checked out. There was no swelling, but the team decided to hold him out for the rest of the game anyway. But Nash wasn\u2019t content to let his day end in so dull a fashion. Instead he had laytex gloves wrapped around his ankle, which was then bandaged up. The result was what looked like an extremely swollen, injured ankle. Nelson played along and somberly notified D\u2019Antoni. \u201cI told him, \u2018It\u2019s not looking good. It\u2019s got a lot of swelling,\u2019 \u201d Nelson laughed. \u201cMike looked down and saw Steve\u2019s foot all wrapped up and turned white as a ghost. Steve was prankster. He loved to play along.\u201d The Canadian prankster could tug at heartstrings as effectively as he tickled funny bones. An incredibly passionate soccer fan, Nash turns every World Cup into a pilgrimage. Between matches, he will play with friends on asphalt courts and have a blast for a few weeks. When Nash found out Nelson was going to marry his long-time girlfriend during the 2006 World Cup, he was devastated. Knowing his friend\u2019s affinity for the game and its defining event, Nelson shrugged it off. Nash didn\u2019t. He flew to England, then Newark, survived weather delays and finally arrived in Phoenix the morning of the wedding. Nelson and his groomsmen met him at a local restaurant (so Nash could keep an eye on the World Cup). Nash then attended the wedding and reception before hopping back on a plane back to Europe. \u201cWho does that?\u201d Nelson laughed. The same guy that invited all of his teammates onto the podium when he received his MVP trophy. The same guy who has received an honorary degree for humanitarianism. The same guy who weeps with his team when an unexpected playoff run falls just short of the ultimate goal. \u201cHe had a tremendous outlook on life, including making everybody feel special,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cWhether it was a teammate, broadcaster or fan, he always had time to talk to whoever was approaching him. We don\u2019t always accent the success of an ahtlete by saying he was also a special person. I think with Steve, you may even have to start with that.\u201d On Friday, Nash will receive the ultimate honor of his sport. He will join the company of those to whom he aspired, those against whom he has been compared, and, eventually, those who even now try to replicate and build upon the best parts of his game. \u201cI talk to my children about Steve when I talk about what it takes to be a Hall of Famer. How to persevere. He\u2019s the epitome of a player who works to become great.\u201d The work and greatness never yielded the NBA\u2019s ultimate prize. Then again, this week \u2014 like other Hall of Fame inductions were for others \u2014 is proof Nash didn\u2019t need a title to cement himself as one of the greatest in the game. \u201cI\u2019m just happy for him as a person,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cForget about the player. We all know he\u2019s a great player. I don\u2019t think it could happen to a better person.\u201d McCoy, who has called some of the biggest games and witnessed the biggest legends in NBA history for over 40 years, summed it up best. \u201cHe\u2019s where he belongs.\u201d"},{"id":38848,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-reportedly-reach-buyout-agreement-luol-deng","date":"2018-09-01","title":"Los Angeles Lakers reach agreement on buyout with veteran Luol Deng","content":" EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers waived forward Luol Deng on Saturday, just over two years after signing him to a four-year, $72 million free-agent contract. The Lakers didn\u2019t disclose the details of a probable buyout with Deng, but they announced the move on the first day in which the final season of Deng\u2019s mammoth deal could be stretched over a three-season span of the Lakers\u2019 cap limit. \u201cWe made this move to further our future salary cap and roster flexibility as we continue to build this Lakers team according to our current overall vision,\u201d Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said in a statement. The 33-year-old Deng\u2019s deal is a remnant of the administration of former Lakers basketball boss Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak. The duo handed a pair of generous free-agent deals in 2016 to Deng and center Timofey Mozgov, who got a four-year, $64 million contract. Buss and Kupchak were dismissed seven months later, and Magic Johnson\u2019s administration went to work ridding itself of lengthy commitments. The Lakers gave up guard D\u2019Angelo Russell in a trade with Brooklyn last summer because they could include Mozgov\u2019s contract. Deng appeared in 56 games during his first year with the Lakers, but he played just one game last season with Johnson and Pelinka in charge of the Lakers\u2019 front office. Although the 14-year NBA veteran was the Lakers\u2019 highest-paid player last season, he essentially wasn\u2019t part of the team. He appeared in the season opener before dropping out of the rotation and eventually spending long stretches away from the Lakers. The two-time All-Star felt he didn\u2019t fit well into coach Luke Walton\u2019s up-tempo system, and he apparently declined to rejoin the rotation when the Lakers were slowed by injuries. He requested a buyout or a trade, but the Lakers found no takers and didn\u2019t want to absorb the salary-cap constraints of waiving him last season. Deng\u2019s departure and contract stretch should sharply increase the Lakers\u2019 available cap room by roughly $12 million for next summer, when they hope to add a second superstar on a maximum contract to join LeBron James. Deng is likely to find a home quickly as a free agent. Although Walton had said he was open to reintegrating Deng into the roster during the upcoming season, waiving Deng gives him plenty of time to sign on with a new team before NBA training camps open in three weeks."},{"id":38866,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/30-teams-30-days-phoenix-suns","date":"2018-09-01","title":"30 Teams in 30 Days: Phoenix Suns finally ready to turn corner","content":" What offseason?  That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team: Phoenix Suns 2017-18 Record : 21-61, did not qualify for the playoffs. Who\u2019s new: Coach Igor Kokoskov, Deandre Ayton (Draft); Mikal Bridges (Draft); Trevor Ariza, (free agency), De\u2019Anthony Melton (trade), Ryan Anderson (trade) Who\u2019s gone: Tyler Ulis, Alex Len, Elfrid Payton, Jared Dudley, Marquese Chriss, Brandon Knight The lowdown: The Suns leaned heavily on youth in 2017-18 and the results were predictable. Development was slow, even nonexistent in some cases, and so were wins and consistency. If this wasn\u2019t rock-bottom for a once-proud franchise, then it\u2019s in the discussion. Earl Watson lasted just the first three games (all losses) as coach and was replaced by interim coach Jay Triano , who wasn\u2019t retained after the season. On too many nights, the Suns were a welcome sight on the schedule for much of the league. They finished dead last, losing 31 of their last 35 games, in what appeared to be a clear backpedal sprint toward gaining the highest possible odds of winning the Draft lottery . The Suns haven\u2019t cracked 25 wins in any of the last three seasons and whiffed on most of the high Draft picks they stockpiled for their misery. That qualifies as a double whammy. But this offseason was finally a pivot in the right direction, with a big No. 1 overall Draft pick, a surprising free-agent signing, a curious coaching move and a massive contract extension that locked up their only proven asset. The pick was Ayton, a potential frontcourt game-changer who brings shot-blocking skills, tender mid-range shooting touch and decent moves around the rim. He\u2019s a potential double-double guy for plenty of years and because he should get heavy minutes right from the start on a projected losing team, statistically he should be in the Kia Rookie of the Year race. Ayton does play a spot on the floor that\u2019s somewhat devalued in today\u2019s stretch-happy NBA but his combination of height (7-foot-1), length and NBA-ready body was too enticing for Phoenix to skip. The only risk is if Luka Doncic or someone else turns into a thriving NBA star, but even then, it\u2019s hard to second-guess the Suns for grabbing such a talented big man. Besides, nobody else in the Draft came with more franchise-player twinkle. Ayton was the consensus No. 1 by NBA scouts, so the Suns\u2019 decision wasn\u2019t exactly a shock. However, signing Ariza did catch many by surprise because a week earlier on Draft night, the Suns surrendered a juicy future No. 1 pick belonging to the Heat to get Bridges, who plays the same position. At this stage of his career, Ariza is a missing piece for a contender. Why would the developing Suns give him playing time that might delay the progress of Bridges, Josh Jackson \u2014 last year\u2019s No. 1 pick, who finished strong \u2014 or TJ Warren (who makes $11 million)? That\u2019s quite a crowd at the wing. The desire on Ariza\u2019s end is also head-scratching. He bailed on a Houston Rockets squad that was a healthy Chris Paul hamstring away from possibly playing for \u2014 or winning \u2014 an NBA title. However, Ariza was weary of working below his market value as a three-and-D player. That\u2019s why his craving for cash (a reported $15 million next season, roughly double his 2017-18 salary) was stronger than his desire to compete for a title. And if you forgot, he won a ring in 2010 with the Los Angeles Lakers, so maybe that thirst was quenched. A deeper commitment by Phoenix was made to leading scorer Devin Booker for five years and $158 million , a max deal for a first-chance extension qualifier. Booker represents the only zero-debate Draft decision made by the Suns over the last few years and, at least offensively, he\u2019s a force. By wasting no time in extending Booker, the Suns took no chance on allowing him to inch closer to even restricted free agency. Until someone else better comes along \u2014 the Suns should be so lucky if that happens \u2014 he\u2019s the face of the franchise. What\u2019s up with player development in Phoenix? The Suns bailed on Chriss ( reported trade to the Rockets ) and Len ( left for Atlanta in free agency ), a pair of recent lottery picks who never showed growth. For them to leave before getting extensions on their rookie contracts was a show of no-faith by the franchise, and the Suns essentially gave them away for little or nothing. Is Dragan Bender next? Knight was dealt to Houston as well (in the Criss trade), meaning the Suns must find a starting point guard soon or give the spot to Booker. Melton, suspended all of last season at USC because of an NCAA investigation, is a combo guard who looked impressive in summer league but might not be ready for big minutes. Bridges wasn\u2019t thrilled to join the Suns on Draft night. Originally picked by the hometown Sixers (which also employed his mother), Bridges was unceremoniously flipped him to Phoenix for Zhaire Smith and a future first-rounder . Yet the former Villanova star will love being on a non-contender that can give him minutes right away, unlike what he would\u2019ve had in Philly. And the Suns will love Bridges if his college shooting touch translates well to the NBA. All of this will be surveyed by Kokoskov, the most exotic NBA hire in recent history . He becomes the first European native coach to sit in the first seat on an NBA bench. Kokoskov has extensive NBA experience as an assistant in a handful of spots. He was on the Detroit Pistons\u2019 staff when they won the title in 2004 . He worked with then-LA Clippers coach Alvin Gentry from 2001-03, was a Suns assistant from 2008-13 and, most recently, spent the last three seasons as the Utah Jazz\u2019s top assistant coach . This wasn\u2019t entirely out-of-the-box thinking by the Suns as Kokoskov comes with high praise and brings good people skills to the job. What he\u2019ll need is patience. The Suns might not yet be on the verge of reversing their fortunes, but took bold moves this summer to add assets and attempt to scale the mountain. At the very least, they hope to end next season with a winning stretch for a change, with Ayton shedding most if not all of his rookie skin by then.

It was too painful, both physically and emotionally, for Grant Hill to go over all of the scenarios in his mind while trying to heal his body. An All-American and two-time national champion at Duke, Hill continued his dominance in the early years of his NBA career with the Detroit Pistons. He shared Rookie of the Year honors with Jason Kidd in 1995 and was the man expected by many to serve as the superstar bridge for the league between the Michael Jordan era and whatever came next. A seven-time All-Star and a five-time All-NBA selection, Hill was on a trajectory that could have seen him become one of the league\u2019s all-time greats. He piled up 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists in the first six seasons of his career. Oscar Robertson, Larry Bird and LeBron James are the only three players in league history to eclipse those numbers after their first six seasons. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people who get anointed to carry the crown of being the face of the league. And when Grant Hill came in he was basically anointed by the league, players and everyone, he was anointed to be the next face of the league,\u201d former Pistons great and Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas said after Hill was announced as one of the selections for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2018 . \u201cWhen you talk about 6-8 guys with a handle, we see a lot of those guys now, but Grant Hill was the first guy who came into the NBA that I remember being 6-8 with a killer crossover. His crossover wasn\u2019t like Allen Iverson\u2019s, but for a 6-8 guy, it was like Iverson\u2019s.\u201d If not for multiple ankle injuries interrupting what should have been the prime of his career, Hill might very well have put up career numbers that matched his early profile. Instead, his 19-year career \u2014 which included stops with the Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns and LA Clippers \u2014 is celebrated as much for his early brilliance as it was the perseverance he showed in his post-injury years.  \u201cI\u2019ve said this before, but if he and Penny Hardaway hadn\u2019t gotten hurt and had to deal with the injuries they did during their careers, the bar for imagery, in terms of the player you wanted to be like if you were 6-7 or 6-8, it would have been those two guys,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe see a lot of young players like that these days, guys who see LeBron James and Kevin Durant as the players they want to model their games after, the guys they want to play like. If Penny and Grant don\u2019t get hurt, those are the two guys back in their day that everyone wants to play like.\u201d Hill would have settled for at least a brief return to his pre-injury form. But it never happened. He was a stellar role player, great in every locker room he set foot in and one of the league\u2019s best ambassadors off the court. He only enjoyed rare flashes of the elite athleticism that marked his early years and retired on June 1, 2013 . Hill\u2019s Hall of Fame case was bolstered by the combination of the quality and length of his NBA career, as well as his spectacular college career. In addition to the two national titles, he also led the Blue Devils to a third Final Four during his career from 1990-94. He also earned National Defensive Player of the Year, ACC Player of the Year and first-team All-American honors as a Blue Devil. He is the first former Blue Devils player to receive Hall of Fame honors. The son of former NFL Pro Bowl running back Calvin Hill and Janet Hill, Grant Hill insists he\u2019s best known to the new generation of basketball fans for his work as an analyst for Turner Sports\u2019 NBA and March Madness coverage. Hill is also a part of the ownership group, led by Tony Ressler, that purchased the Atlanta Hawks in June of 2015 , keeping him engaged in the game on several different levels. He spoke with NBA.com about his journey from the Washington D.C. suburbs to his college and pro days and now Springfield, where the Hall of Fame class will be enshrined Sept. 7: NBA.com:  Do you look back at your basketball life, from high school to Duke to the NBA and nearly two decades in the league, and feel like it went by in a flash? Hill:  It\u2019s funny, when you\u2019re in it and particularly for me post-injury, those last nine years, it seemed like it was a long career. I mean, particularly when you\u2019re in your late 30s, it\u2019s like, \u2018wow, I\u2019ve been going at this for a while.\u2019 But then you look back when you retire and now five years removed and you kind of reflect on it all, it does seem like it all went by pretty fast. I was just getting ready to come into the league and you\u2019re coming off your college stuff, and it just doesn\u2019t seem like college was 20 years ago or whatever it was. It doesn\u2019t seem like I just started playing varsity at [South Lakes High in Reston, Va.] over 30 years ago. It\u2019s like where did the time go. You are up and you can\u2019t run anymore and you\u2019re middle aged, and it\u2019s like what happened? NBA.com:  Well, let\u2019s go back to that time, before you hit high school and the varsity. When was that time or that moment for you when you realized basketball was going to be more than just a game for you?  Hill:  I think in my pre-Duke years, there were two moments when it hit me. Up until high school I played soccer, basketball and whatever and I was a fan, more a fan of college basketball. I obviously knew about the NBA but I was still just a fan. You dreamed about it. But it was one of those things where the idea of it just seemed so impossible, you know. So for me at the end of my eighth grade year I played in a national tournament, an AAU tournament \u2014 and it looked a lot different then compared to what they look like now \u2014 and our team won the tournament. And playing on that stage in St. Louis, and [Chris] Webber and [Alan] Henderson and [Jamal] Mashburn were all there representing their teams, and even at that point, even though I was really young, I held my own. I was an All-Star, I thought I should have been MVP but another guy on my team got it. But at that point you are measuring yourself against the so-called best in the country and not just in your neighborhood or your neck of the woods. So that was a huge confidence booster. NBA.com:  You said there were two moments, what was the other one? Hill:  Yes, then came my freshman year of high school. I didn\u2019t want to play varsity as a freshman. I wanted to play with my friends but my varsity coach asked me to play and my dad told me to play, and keep in mind I started high school when I was 13 so I was young. So again, I wanted to play with my friends on the freshmen team, who by the way went 22-0 that year, so if I had played with them I might have messed them up (laughing). But I played varsity and spending that year on the varsity and that experience gave me a big boost of confidence. I started getting letters from colleges and that summer and then my sophomore year is when things really took off. Now I\u2019m not just one of the top young players in the D.C. area, you know the DMV, but I\u2019m holding my own and putting up numbers with the best high school players in the DMV and around the country. And I think that\u2019s when it really hit me that I\u2019ve got a chance to play at a major Division I school. I certainly wasn\u2019t thinking NBA or anything like the Hall of Fame back then, you didn\u2019t go there. But college ball certainly was on my mind and the dream was to maybe have an opportunity to play for a national championship one day in college. NBA.com:  The environment then seems so much different than what it is for the elite high school players now. The hoop dream was there, but it seems like it\u2019s gotten bigger, if that makes sense, in the years since you were a McDonald\u2019s All-American and going along on your journey?   Hill:  It\u2019s funny you say that. I was recently with [Jason] Kidd and we had a chance to talk and reflect on our respective careers. And it was a little different for him growing up in Oakland and the Bay Area. He was maybe around older guys and guys who had been in the league, but you just didn\u2019t think about the league when you were at those camps and tournaments with the other elite high school players. The conversations weren\u2019t about the NBA, it was always about making it to the college level and finding the best place for you on that level. You had the dream, it was maybe always in the back of your mind, but the circumstances were so different a generation ago. Like I said, my confidence prior to my freshman year of high school to after my freshman year was night and day. NBA.com:  So much has been made over the years about you choosing Duke for college. Your mom wanted you to go to Georgetown and your dad wanted you to go to North Carolina. What made you split the middle and go with Duke? Hill:  The context of why my parents felt that way is pretty interesting. The first game I saw and really fell in love with the game was the 1982 NCAA title game with Georgetown and North Carolina. That game with Patrick Ewing and Sleepy Floyd for Georgetown and James Worthy and of course Michael Jordan as a freshman hitting that shot to win the game. From that moment on I followed those two teams. And we had just bought a Betamax and the first thing we taped was that Final Four, so I watched that game so many times I know the entire call, I memorized that game and was obsessed with it. And then Michael Jackson, who went to Georgetown, he went to my local high school and lived a couple streets down from me, so I started watching him when he was in high school. Back in the day you\u2019d go to the local high school and watch the game and he was like this amazing player. I idolized him, really before I even really knew about college basketball. And he was going to Georgetown, so my mom ending up getting season tickets and my mom and I, we had two tickets, and we would go to all these games at the [Capital] Center and she became a huge Georgetown fan. And my dad had always been a fan of Dean Smith really based on a lot of what he did in the 1970s, integrating the ACC and just his stance on a lot of social issues more than just what he\u2019d done as one of the greatest coaches in the history of the game. So those were the two schools I had grown up watching and they both had their own opinions as to what was best. NBA.com:  So like all good, obedient children, you chose Duke? Hill:  (Laughing) Exactly. But seriously, Duke, and really Coach K (Mike Krzyzewski), just made an impression on me. I got to know him and follow what he was doing with his teams and his program. And as our communication increased, phone calls and mail, and then going and taking official visits my junior year of high school, it was just something about him I believed in and I wanted to be a part of that program. I took one visit, one official visit, and when I came back from it I knew that\u2019s where I wanted to be. NBA.com:  When you look back on that decision now and the legacy you left as one the greatest players in Duke and college basketball history on those championship teams, does it register that you are to someone else who Michael Jackson was to you, growing up and idolizing a star player who seemed larger than life? Hill:  It\u2019s crazy. Like when I finished up at Duke and went into the NBA, I was kind of like the big brother. I\u2019m in Detroit and you\u2019ve got Elton Brand and Shane Battier and Corey Maggette and that whole crew and Jeff Capel, I\u2019m not that far removed in terms of my age differential from those guys. Now you get to the mid-2000s and you fast forward realizing that I\u2019m old enough to be a parent of some of these guys now and the kids like Jayson Tatum and Harry Giles and even R.J. Barrett, they are all sort of aware of what I did and my career at Duke, and certainly the ups and the downs of my professional career and even the television work keeps me somewhat relevant in their eyes, but it\u2019s the parents who know me better than the kids. And that humbles you real quick. I happened to be at Duke last year and gave a speech and had a couple of speaking engagements during homecoming. And R.J. was on his visit and I think his parents were more excited to see me than he was. Jayson Tatum\u2019s mom is a die-hard Tamia (wife, artist) fan, so it\u2019s funny how I went from a contemporary to big brother to uncle to now. I don\u2019t know, some of these kids were born after I was healthy in Detroit, and it\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s also a sense of real pride to know that I played a part in the legacy of those teams. These young guys weren\u2019t born when we did what we did at Duke, but the impact is still felt and there\u2019s certainly a healthy respect for what we were able to accomplish as a group. NBA.com: You mentioned your healthy years in Detroit and it must seem like another lifetime. Even with the injured years, you lasted 19 years. Do you still wrestle with the idea of what might have been if you weren\u2019t injured or do you look back and see nearly 20 years in the league and marvel at how you got through it all? Hill:  You know, that\u2019s a really good question. I think when I was in the midst of it, fighting the injuries in Orlando and then went to Phoenix, you\u2019re just so caught up in the moment and looking forward. You don\u2019t have time to dwell on what did or didn\u2019t happen in the past. You\u2019re only focused on what do I need to do to get healthy, to add value to this team, what do I need to do to be competitive in my late 30s and into my 40s? You\u2019re just so focused and the direction is forward. For me actually, when I retired and people start talking about where you fit and the Hall of Fame and things like that, you slow down a little bit and contemplate your basketball life, so to speak. I kind of convinced myself in a way that, and maybe it was a way to protect myself if none of this [Hall of Fame] ever happened, that I didn\u2019t need that stuff because I know what I overcame and what I had to fight through just to get back and play in my final years. That was the most important thing for me. That validated the journey for me. At least that\u2019s what I convinced myself of immediately after I retired. But then when this all came about and I got that call (from the Hall of Fame), you realize that you might have suppressed some things.  NBA.com:  You were supposed to be the heir apparent to Michael Jordan. I remember the arguments when you played in Detroit, before Kobe and T-Mac and Vince Carter. That has to be a hard thing to shake, what could have or should have been? Hill:  It does bother me that I was hurt, that I was on this trajectory early on in Detroit and things were coming together and then it\u2019s an incomplete. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see it through, to see what could have been. And that\u2019s something that, if I\u2019m being honest with myself, it really, really bothered me. And maybe I\u2019m getting too deep with this, but the Hall of Fame is very validating for me and I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed it, how much I needed that recognition that \u2026 I don\u2019t always see what I did back in the day, back in the 90s. I remember the end. And I remember the hard times, the struggles. So I sat with J-Kidd recently and one of the amazing things \u2026 his career was amazing and he solidified everything he was able to accomplish with the numbers and the championship and just a stellar, long career. He was able to see it through. But to hear him talk about me and to hear what he thought of me back in the 90s, even now, not to say that I was overly sensitive, but somebody like him remembers. And I don\u2019t remember it the same way. I remember being hurt. I\u2019ve tended to focus on the struggle. So in a round sort of way this has all been a validating thing for me and confirmed some things for me. I did some good things, I did play in the Olympics. I was elite, for a period of time, you know. It wasn\u2019t all bad, if that makes sense. NBA.com:  It does. The reason I brought that up is because I had this conversation with Dominique Wilkins the year he went into the Hall of Fame and he admitted that he\u2019d done a poor job recognizing his significance while he was playing. He said he didn\u2019t compartmentalize his career while he was in the midst of it because he was working so hard to reach a certain level that he just didn\u2019t have or make the time to take a step back and really appreciate what he\u2019d accomplished. Is it difficult for you as well to get a grasp on what you and your career might mean to the outside world until you get the proper distance and a different perspective? Hill:  You really don\u2019t have that time when you\u2019re in the middle of it. You just don\u2019t. And I wonder, too, if today\u2019s era and generation of players will have a different perspective, will they have more awareness because of social media. I don\u2019t know. In my case, it was an interesting journey and everyone\u2019s story is unique. But yeah, I forget sometimes, even my kids remind me. When I was in Phoenix, my daughter Myla would go on YouTube and look at old highlights and she said, \u2018oh dad, you weren\u2019t always a scrub.\u2019 And you repair your ego a little bit, you look at it and go, \u2018oh yeah, I was pretty good at one time.\u2019 I\u2019ve had more of those sort of moments now that reflect and get a chance to look back over the years to see some of the things I was fortunate enough to do. I don\u2019t think I appreciated how talented or good I was while I was going through those moments, but it really lifts you up to have people remind you. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

A zealot for repetition? That\u2019s closer to the truth. A borderline sufferer of obsessive-compulsive disorder? That\u2019s very real, as Allen sees it. A cautious soul who respects ritual, heeds superstitions and prefers never to tempt fate? That\u2019s all part of Walter Ray Allen\u2019s journey to Springfield, Mass., too. Mostly, though, when Allen officially is enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Friday, he\u2019ll go in because of his diligence, with which he honed every skill he possessed to maximum sharpness across 18 NBA seasons. Long before Sam Hinkie, Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers turned \u201cTrust the Process\u201d into a marketing slogan and a Twitter hashtag, Allen had embraced it as his personal pebble-grained philosophy. \u201cOur nickname for him is \u2018Everyday Ray,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said when he had Allen as a Heat sniper from 2012-2014. \u201cIt\u2019s every day. It\u2019s not every other day. It\u2019s not some days. It\u2019s every single day Ray. His work ethic and his discipline are in the top percentage in this league. Ninety-nine percent of the players do not have that type of consistent work ethic.\u2019\u2019 Any highlights shown before, during or after Allen\u2019s induction as part of the illustrious, 13-member Class of 2018 at Springfield\u2019s Symphony Hall will be the final cut from mountains of virtual video and faux film that went unshot in gyms across America. The sweat, the effort and the precision of taking the same jumper in exactly the same way \u2013 footwork, form, elevation, release, launch angle, backspin \u2013 went largely unseen. From his days as a preternaturally mature high school player through his days at UConn and on to memorable stops in four NBA markets \u2013 Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston and Miami \u2013 Allen took author Malcolm (\u201cOutliers\u201d) Gladwell\u2019s 10,000 Hours Rule to the extreme, appending an exponent to it. That old carpenter\u2019s motto of measuring twice and cutting once applied 50 or 100 times over to the 6-foot-5 shooting guard\u2019s regimen; for every clutch shot that dropped in the fourth quarter of a game that mattered, Allen had launched multiples just like it in front of empty seats. By uber-practicing, Allen left little to chance and shut the door on doubt, enabling him to work amid chaos in a warm glow of preparation and confidence. Exhibit A: Allen\u2019s business-as-usual 3-pointer from the right corner in the late moments of Game 6 of the 2013 Finals, a make that snatched a championship away from the San Antonio Spus and ranks as arguably the most famous and impactful shot in NBA history. He had made that shot, identical in every way \u2013 same backpedaling to the arc, time running out, smooth and swift release \u2013 so many times before, only with nothing on the line and no one in the house. As Spoelstra told Fox Sports the next season: \u201c[I\u2019m] grateful for Ray and his obsessive-compulsive work ethic to work on that shot thousands and thousands of times, when everybody else would think that was too ridiculous a circumstance to actually try to practice something like that.\u201d So much of Allen\u2019s basketball career sprang from intelligent design, you almost wonder if he had a schematic tucked in his back pocket way back on draft night in 1996 , when Minnesota picked him but promptly traded him to Milwaukee for fellow draftee Stephon Marbury (who went No. 4 overall). It\u2019s as if Allen had a plan from the start, something simple like: 1. Practice. A lot. 2. Methodically build a magnificent career brick by brick \u2013 or in Allen\u2019s case, non-brick by non-brick \u2013 by incessantly repeating No. 1 on this list. 3. Pocket two championship rings, play in 10 All-Star Games and exit as the league\u2019s all-time leader in 3-point field goal attempts and makes. 4. Write Hall of Fame speech, clocking in at a tidy 4:59 given the five-minute max, for first-ballot enshrinement in 2018. Allen chuckled a bit at the idea of such a plan in a wide-ranging conversation last week. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, you couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a plan for nothing. I didn\u2019t know how it was supposed to go down. What I wanted to make sure of was that I didn\u2019t take myself out of the game by causing my own faults and my own mistakes.\u201d Allen\u2019s approach was far less detailed and limited primarily to what he could control. \u201cThe No. 1 key for success \u2013 for All-Star games, Olympic team, Hall of Fame \u2013 is being available,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I made sure I was in the best shape and the most prepared I could be to give myself the best chances to be out there. \u201cI\u2019m seen as a clutch player over the course of my career because I hit shots in the fourth quarter. But being out there in the fourth quarter means I\u2019m one of the best in shape. You get to that mountain in the fourth quarter, other people are starting to fade and you\u2019re still going.\u201d With all due respect to the other nine enshrinees this year, Allen, 43, is one of four recently retired NBA legends elected in their first year of eligibility for the Naismith shrine. They entered the league two at a time in the 1990s: Grant Hill and Jason Kidd (1994), and Steve Nash and Allen (1996). In Allen\u2019s case, a straight line can be drawn from his upbringing in a military family to the habits he developed and channeled into basketball. His father Walter had served as a metal technician in the Air Force, moving his wife Flora, Ray and Ray\u2019s four siblings from California to Germany, to Oklahoma, to England and eventually to Dalzell, S.C., about 40 miles from Columbia. The value of work and a sense of duty were ingrained in Allen by that life. \u201cAs a child,\u201d he said last week, \u201cthe one thing I paid close attention to was the simple fact that my dad, every day, he went to work. And he couldn\u2019t choose to not go to work. He couldn\u2019t say, \u2018Today I\u2019m not coming in\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m quitting.\u2019 \u201cToday we live in a culture where kids decide they want to transfer from their school or they want to switch AAU teams because \u2018the coach doesn\u2019t like me.\u2019 I saw from my dad, he didn\u2019t have a choice. Once you sign up for the military, you are property of the U.S. government. And you have to own up to that and be accountable to that. Not only to the government but to the people you\u2019ve enlisted with.\u201d Forced repeatedly to adapt to new surroundings, Allen hit South Carolina \u2013 and experiences off a military base \u2013 at a pivotal point. In junior high and in high school, he got a taste of race relations Southern style, where crossing social lines wasn\u2019t easy even for a basketball star, even in the late 1980s and early \u201890s. So that pushed him even harder, making him careful not to stumble when some might have wanted him to fall. Allen\u2019s sense of purpose, of seizing any opportunity to move on from Dalzell and succeed, made him a little wiser beyond his years. \u201cIt goes back to when I was 12 or 13,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were so many outside forces I paid attention to, when it came to drinking alcohol, exercise, food. What I always did, I put myself in situations around people I could learn from. People who were doing it the right way. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it while I was doing it, but I was gravitating toward those individuals. Going to UConn, I was around other people how had like minds, who wanted to grow and get better and win. It wasn\u2019t just that they were saying it \u2013 I was seeing it. \u2026 The habits of being successful.\u201d  In college, it was coach Jim Calhoun and teammates Kevin Ollie, Donyell Marshall, Donny Marshall (no relation), among others. When Allen joined the Bucks as an NBA rookie, veterans Michael Curry and Elliot Perry were there to share their practice routines. His talent and preparation paid off quickly, with Allen averaging 19.5 points in his second season and, in his fourth, earning the first of three consecutive All-Star invitations. Milwaukee thrived as a team, too, coming within a game of reaching The Finals in 2001, losing the East title to Philadelphia in Game 7 . Egos, poor personnel decisions and personalities \u2014 not the least of which was coach George Karl\u2019s dislike for Allen\u2019s smooth, centered, unemotional manner \u2014 torpedoed that Bucks team and sent Allen packing via a trade to the Seattle SuperSonics . He had his greatest statistical success in Seattle, averaging 24.6 ppg, 4.6 rpg and 4.2 apg in 296 games, and in 2005-06 set the then-single season record for 3-pointers (269). Allen still was a full-service offensive threat, equally adept at scoring off the dribble or shooting from outside. But the league was changing. When he was drafted, NBA teams averaged 1,377 3-point attempts per season. In his 10th season, Allen took nearly half that number (653) by himself. And by his final year, 2013-14, teams were jacking up nearly 30 percent more treys than when he started. \u201cW hen George Karl came in, we played faster,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd if we had a good shot available, we\u2019d always take it. But early in my career, a lot of my coaches \u2013 if you took the 3 \u2013 were like, \u2018You don\u2019t have to settle. You\u2019re settling.\u2019 Now that\u2019s changed. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to go completely in that direction \u2013 I like to see the big men in the game, to play in the post and play inside-out every now and then. It\u2019s great to see so many shooters, but I don\u2019t want to see bad percentages.\u201d Five years after Allen set the single-season mark for 3-point makes, he snagged Reggie Miller\u2019s NBA career regular-season record by hitting his 2,561st shot from distance. Miller, who had held the record for eight years, was working the game that night in Boston for TNT. He will be in Springfield Friday as Allen\u2019s Hall of Fame presenter. \u201cReggie seemed like the most logical choice when I thought about my career,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhen I first came in, I watched him and how he prepared. He was always somebody who set a tone. In the back of my mind, I was like, \u2018Wow, I need to have this type of routine and consistency.\u2019 With he and I being the tops in 3-point shooting in the NBA, it seemed like a no-brainer.\u201d When the two met head-to-head early in Allen\u2019s career, he dreaded chasing the peripatetic Miller around and through screens set by Indiana\u2019s bigs. It was hellish, but the younger shooter got up close and personal with Miller\u2019s stroke, unorthodox as it was. Allen\u2019s always was much prettier, but there still was a lesson to be drawn.  \u201cIn trying to figure out consistency for my shot, every coach would say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to keep your elbow tucked, you\u2019ve got to work on this,\u2019 just this whole thought process of what shooting is supposed to be like,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThen I saw Reggie cross his arms. I was like, \u2018The best shooter in the NBA crosses his arm but he\u2019s shooting 90 percent from the free throw line and 45 percent from 3.\u2019 It gave me the power to say, \u2018Whatever you\u2019re doing, stick to what you know but make sure you work at it.\u2019 \u201d Allen\u2019s career shifted into a different gear in 2007 when he \u2014 and soon thereafter, a boyhood acquaintance from South Carolina hoops, Kevin Garnett \u2014 got traded to Boston . He, Garnett and Paul Pierce quickly sorted out the opportunities and sacrifices on tap from that super-teaming, and with coach Doc Rivers\u2019 \u201cUbuntu\u201d team cohesiveness and precocious point guard Rajon Rondo, the Celtics won the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy in that group\u2019s first season together. They stayed together for five, posting a 273-121 mark while reaching the Finals again in 2010 and getting to the brink in 2012, leading 3-2 in the East championship series before losing to Miami. Allen, who increasingly had been used as a perimeter threat (his 3-point attempt rate went from 39.3 percent in Seattle to 43.6 in Boston), didn\u2019t like Rivers\u2019 plan to bring him off the bench after that (or appreciate growing friction with Rondo). Instead, he signed with the Heat as a free agent . That ruffled Celtics\u2019 feathers but enabled Allen to team with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh and get his second ring. By this stage, before and after his yellow-rope-defying, history-making corner 3, Allen was in full craftsman mode, his consuming preparation setting the bar high for the entire NBA. Allen would eat the same meals daily, at home or on the road. In hotels, he would take his game-day naps and order room service at precisely the same time each day. Then he would leave for the arena long before his teammates, arriving about 3 and a half hours before the game. When a few of his super-friends began to join him, grabbing taxis rather than waiting for a team bus, the Heat had to adjust. \u201cW e said, \u2018Wait a minute. If we have millions of dollars [in player-assets] going in these cabs, this organization needs to create a new bus,\u2019 \u201d Spoelstra said back then. \u201cNow because of Ray Allen, we have three buses. It\u2019s called the \u2018early shooters bus.\u2019 \u201d Often, though, Allen was alone, save for some team staffers who would rebound and help with his grinding drills.  \u201c It was my obsession to be good every day,\u201d he told NBA.com. \u201cSo things had to be in order. After a while, you obsess over it. My shoes needed to be side by side in my locker before a game \u2014 that lets me know I\u2019m prepared and in turn tells my teammates, \u2018This guy is ready to go.\u2019 It\u2019s small things like that. Is it ritual or is it paranoia or is it just systematic? For me, it was all of the above.\u201d For someone self-diagnosed with mild OCD, Allen wrapped his career with some nice clean numbers: 1300 games, 19.0 ppg, 40.0 accuracy from the arc. He also proved durable, playing in every game his first five seasons and missing fewer than 10 in nine of his other 13 seasons. \u201c Being available is so simple, but it\u2019s so complicated,\u201d Allen said. \u201cPlaying 82 games, it\u2019s very doable, especially when you\u2019re young. But when January hits and you have to go to Cleveland or Milwaukee and it\u2019s 10 degrees outside and you\u2019re on a back-to-back or you have to get up the next day and go to practice, how committed are you on that day? You\u2019ve got to show up and not just bring your body but bring your mind with you too.\u201d If Allen at times seemed almost robotic on the court, his shooting stroke locked in and his emotions held in check, well, he\u2019d take that as a compliment. \u201cIt\u2019s a process and once it\u2019s in play, you\u2019ve got to follow it through so you become like a machine,\u201d he said. \u201cTeams that do well in the playoffs, they\u2019re machines by then because they\u2019ve been doing it all year.\u201d When James left Miami in July of 2014 , effectively ending Miami\u2019s Big Three run, Allen left too \u2014 unsigned. He stayed that way in a quiet, unofficial retirement before making it official two years later. Why no comeback, given his marathoner\u2019s physical condition and his ability to still drain jump shots? A combination, Allen said, of limited interest, teams that weren\u2019t ready to win or offers \u2014 in money or roles \u2014 that he could refuse. Instead, Allen threw himself into his post-playing life. He wrote a memoir, \u201cFrom the Outside: My Journey Through Life and the Game I Love.\u201d He and his wife Shannon found an organic fast-food restaurant, \u201cGrown.\u201d He has talked about resuming an early passion, acting \u2014 remember, he played Jesus Shuttlesworth in Spike Lee\u2019s 1998 drama \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d He indulges an even greater passion on the golf course, attends to business and charitable duties and is immersed as \u201ccoach\u201d to the four boys \u2014 Rayray, Walker, Wystan and Wynn \u2013 he and Shannon are raising. And yes, Allen has a routine now as well. At least, he\u2019s getting there. \u201c My routine is changing a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to say, when I retired, I wasn\u2019t going to have a weight room in my house because I wanted to go to a gym and get out in the world a little bit. Well, I\u2019ve had my taste of that \u2013 now I want to build one in my house.\u201d Too many Heat fans who recognize him in South Florida, he said, too many distractions interrupting his regimen. \u201cI want to wake up at 4 in the morning and work out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I can get the kids up, fix some breakfast and take \u2018em to school. Then I can go play golf. The rest of my day will fall in line accordingly.\u201d Allen is busier now, he said, than when he played. \u201cI love it. I might get an email next week where they tell me, \u2018We need you over in Shanghai.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Put me on a plane. I\u2019m gone.\u2019 I love it.\u201d Going forward, he\u2019ll be doing it all as a member of the Naismith Hall. \u201c There\u2019s no formula for being in the Hall of Fame because every Hall of Famer has different statistics. Some have won 10 championships, some have won none,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI think ultimately it\u2019s a moment of reflection on what you mean to basketball, your ability to change the game or have an impact on your teammates or the league itself. \u201cThe legends I grew up watching, it was everything in the world to see them play. It\u2019s unfathomable to me that I\u2019m a part of that class. That I\u2019m sitting here talking, and kids are looking up to me that way. But that\u2019s the way the torch is passed. \u201cNow we\u2019re the ones trying to usher in the next generation.\u201d For any of the young guys serious about following in his footsteps, Allen surely has his notes. The early shooter\u2019s bus runs daily.  * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

De\u2019Anthony is a talented young guard who stood out for us throughout the pre-Draft process and at the NBA Summer League.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like to thank Brandon and Marquese for their contributions to the Suns franchise over the past few seasons. We wish them the best of luck as they begin the next chapter of their careers with the Rockets.\u201d Anderson, a 6-10, 240-pound forward, is a 10-year NBA veteran who holds career averages of 12.8 points and 5.4 rebounds while making 2.1 three-pointers per game on 38.2 percent shooting from long range. He has played in 622 career games with New Jersey (2008-09), Orlando (2009-2012), New Orleans (2012-2016) and Houston (2016-2018), in addition to 46 career playoff appearances. One of the most productive \u201cstretch fours\u201d in NBA history, Anderson\u2019s 1,315 career three-pointers are the third-most ever by a player 6-10 or taller, trailing only Dirk Nowitzki and Rashard Lewis. The 2011-12 NBA Most Improved Player Award winner, Anderson is one of just two players to average at least two three-point makes per game in each of the last eight seasons, joined only by Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry. Last season, the 30-year-old averaged 9.3 points and 5.0 rebounds while making 2.0 three-pointers on 38.6 percent three-point shooting in 66 games (50 starts) to help the Rockets to a franchise record 65 wins and a berth in the Western Conference Finals. Anderson entered the NBA after being selected by New Jersey with the 21st overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft. The Sacramento native played two seasons collegiately at the University of California, earning First Team All-Pac-10 honors in 2007-08 after leading the conference with 21.1 points per game. \u200bMelton, a 6-4, 200-pound guard, was selected by the Rockets with the 46th overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. The 20-year-old tied for the lead at NBA Summer League 2018 with 3.0 steals per game, in addition to averaging 16.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists. He was the only rookie, and one of just three players overall, to average at least 15 points, seven boards and four assists at NBA Summer League 2018. Melton\u2019s best performance came on July 9 against the LA Clippers when he posted 26 points, 10 rebounds and five assists while making 5-of-10 three-point attempts. Melton played one season at the University of Southern California before entering the NBA. As a freshman in 2016-17, he averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.0 blocks while leading the Pac-12 and tying a USC freshman record with 69 steals. Melton became the first freshman in all of Division I basketball to record at least 300 points, 150 rebounds, 100 assists, 60 steals and 35 blocks since Dwyane Wade did so for Marquette in 2001-02. A native of North Hollywood, California, Melton led Crespi High School in Encino, California to back-to-back state titles in 2015 and 2016. Chriss played his first two professional seasons with the Suns, averaging 8.5 points and 4.8 rebounds in 154 games since being acquired on the night of the 2016 NBA Draft. Knight, a six-year NBA veteran, averaged 15.0 points and 3.8 assists in 117 games with the Suns after being acquired on Feb. 19, 2015. He did not play in 2017-18 following surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee. "},{"id":38868,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hall-fame-jason-kidd-profile","date":"2018-08-31","title":"Jason Kidd's vision on court was to always assist others","content":" The numbers speak for themselves. Jason Kidd is one of only 13 players that rank in the top 100 all-time in points ( 81st \u2013 17,529 ), rebounds ( 54th \u2013 8,725 ) and assists second \u2013 12,091). He\u2019s the shortest one among the group and also No. 2 all-time in steals (2,684) . But when Kidd is enshrined at the Naismith Hall of Fame on Sept. 7 , it will be about a lot more than the numbers. The unique story of Kidd\u2019s NBA career is about vision, impact, leadership and evolution. You don\u2019t dish out more than 12,000 assists by accident. But you can compile a lot of assists without being a brilliant passer if you have the ball a lot. That wasn\u2019t the case with Kidd, the kind of of passer that we don\u2019t see much of these days. Kidd saw passes that others didn\u2019t and had the nerve to make passes that others wouldn\u2019t. He knew where defenders would be or how to move them (with a look-off) to where he wanted them to be. He was at his best in transition, and a huge chunk of the highlights from his years in New Jersey are Kidd throwing a lead pass to Richard Jefferson, Kerry Kittles, Kenyon Martin or Vince Carter for a layup or dunk. He threw alley-oops off the glass, he avoided defenders by putting spin on the ball, and there may not be a more prolific behind-the-back passer in NBA history. When asked about his vision, Kidd credits the game of soccer, which he played through the sixth grade, before schedule conflicts forced him to limit himself to just basketball and baseball. He and fellow 2018 inductee Steve Nash have discussed soccer\u2019s influence on their passing and footwork. \u201cSoccer is a very pass-oriented game,\u201d Kidd told NBA.com. \u201cYou have to pass, and you have to pass in small areas. It\u2019s passing and movement, being able to move after you pass.\u201d Kidd had to give up soccer to advance his basketball career, but those years playing one sport served him well with the other. Kidd was an elite athlete in his early 20s, and he won a championship at 38. But he was at his best in New Jersey. In the summer of 1999, Rod Thorn was an executive in the league office. And was part of the Senior Mens Basketball Committee for USA Basketball, he was in Puerto Rico for the Tournament of the Americas, where the USA went 10-0 with an average differential of 32 points per game. Kidd started alongside Gary Payton, led the team in assists, and made a huge impression on Thorn. \u201cEverybody gravitated to Jason,\u201d Thorn, also being enshrined this year, told NBA.com. \u201cWithout being the verbal leader, he was the leader. All the top players in the league wanted to play with him, because he passed the ball, because he did all the little things that help you win. And I became a huge fan of him that summer.\u201d Two years later, when Thorn was one year into his tenure as Nets general manager, he reached out to the Phoenix Suns, hoping to bring Kidd to New Jersey. The Suns obliged, and in hindsight, the Kidd-for-Stephon Marbury swap is one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history. When Kidd arrived in New Jersey, he immediately said that the Nets would make the playoffs. At that point, the team was coming off a 26-win season, had been in the NBA for 25 years, and had made the playoffs just seven times. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the Nets thought in those days,\u201d Thorn laughed about Kidd\u2019s bold proclamation.  Kidd showed he was serious by diving for loose balls in training camp. The Nets showed they were serious by playing preseason games to win, and according to Thorn, \u201cyou could see that we were a much better team.\u201d They weren\u2019t just better. They were the best team in the Eastern Conference, winning 52 games and reaching The Finals for the first time since the ABA\/NBA merger. The Nets improved from 25th (in 2000-01) to 18th in offensive efficiency and from 24th to 2nd on defense. At the time, the team\u2019s jump from 26-56 (in 2000-01) to 52-30 was the sixth biggest improvement in NBA history (959 team-seasons where a team played the season prior). It\u2019s still tied for the the 10th biggest improvement (1,436 total team-seasons) and \u201901-02 remains the Nets\u2019 best season in their 42 years in the NBA . Kittles returned after missing the previous season. They added Jefferson and Jason Collins in the Draft, as well as Todd MacCulloch in free agency. Martin was a better player in his second season than he was as a rookie, and a healthier Keith Van Horn played 32 games more than he did in \u201900-01. Including Kidd, the Nets had five Lottery picks on the roster. But the biggest difference between the 2000-01 Nets and the \u201901-02 Nets was the point guard. \u201cThere was some other things that fell into place for us,\u201d Thorn said, \u201cbut he was the catalyst.\u201d Arguably, he was the most valuable player in the league. But he finished second in MVP voting to San Antonio\u2019s Tim Duncan. The Nets were swept in the 2002 Finals , but returned (with a 10-game, postseason winning streak) in 2003 and took two games off the Spurs . In 2004, they gave the eventual-champion Pistons their toughest series before Kidd seemingly ran out of gas in Game 7 . He had microfracture surgery that summer. They never got closer to a championship, but over Kidd\u2019s six full seasons in New Jersey (2001-02 to \u201906-07), only the Spurs (65) and Pistons (63) won more postseason games than the Nets (43). Those 43 wins account for 69 percent of the franchise\u2019s 62 playoff wins in its 42 years in the NBA. New Jersey wasn\u2019t the only place where Kidd made an impact upon arrival. In his rookie season, the Mavs won 23 more games than they did the season prior. In his first full season in Phoenix (1997-98), the Suns saw an increase of 16 wins. In the final season of his playing career, he helped the Knicks win 18 more games than they did the season prior. He was a rookie coach for the Nets\u2019 only playoff series win in their six seasons in Brooklyn, and when he moved to Milwaukee, the Bucks tied the \u201901-02 Nets and \u201903-04 Nuggets for the 10th biggest improvement in NBA history. That kind of impact obviously goes beyond Kidd\u2019s ability to pass, score, rebound and defend. Kidd was a leader. He wasn\u2019t the \u201crah rah\u201d type, but he brought out the best in his teammates, and not just because he got them the ball on time and on target. \u201cThe guy was a fierce, fierce competitive guy, and he never gave up,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk a lot on the court. He didn\u2019t say much at all. He just played. But he was a fierce competitor.\u201d \u201cHe inspired confidence in players, and he inspired players to follow his lead without talking about it all the time. He just did it. They would all say that he pulled them to another level by the way he played and the way he conducted himself on the court.\u201d That Nets\u2019 core was young and impressionable, and they had the right guy at the most important position on the floor. \u201dIt\u2019s unbelievable when you see the star practice hard all the time,\u201d teammate Lucious Harris told the New York Times before the \u201901-02 season began . \u201dHe\u2019ll never look you off. Even if you miss four shots in a row, he\u2019s still going to pass to you.\u201d Even when Kidd wasn\u2019t the star that he was in New Jersey, he remained a leader, guiding the Mavs to the only title in franchise history and the Knicks to their only 50-win season in the last 18 years (and the only season in which they\u2019ve been a better-than-average defensive team in the last 17). \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand that you can mentally be the strength of the team,\u201d Kidd said, \u201cand everybody will look at you when things are bad to see how you\u2019re reacting. You don\u2019t have to be fast. You don\u2019t have to touch the rim. But mentally, if you\u2019re strong and people see that, they\u2019re going to be like, \u2018We\u2019re all right, because Jason\u2019s not panicking. So why would we panic?'\u201d  Of course, Kidd\u2019s success with Dallas was about more than leadership. He was still a valuable contributor at the age of 38 because he saw where he needed to get better at the age of 33. In his prime, Kidd on the break was something to behold, and he didn\u2019t need a consistent jump shot to be an MVP candidate. \u201cAt that time,\u201d Thorn said, \u201cJason was as fast with the ball, from foul line to foul line, as anybody in the league, with the possible exception of Iverson. He was incredibly fast with the ball. He was 6-4, 215 pounds. He was very strong.\u201d But knee surgery in 2004 took away some of Kidd\u2019s athleticism. And the Nets\u2019 acquisition of Vince Carter a few months later took away some of his touches. Kidd understood that he\u2019d have to become a more consistent shooter, so he started working with Nets shooting coach Bob Thate. \u201cI knew Vince was going to take the lead,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about being bumped down, I thought about how I could still be a part of the offense. So I had to figure out how to make the open three.\u201d He figured it out and the work paid off. After shooting 33 percent from 3-point range over his first 13 seasons in the league, Kidd shot 38 percent over his last six seasons. Though Kidd had a lower field goal percentage over his last six seasons, he had a much higher effective field goal percentage than he did over his first 13, because he shot more (and better) from 3-point range. On a recent episode of the Bill Simmons Podcast, Stephen Curry said that at each stage of Kidd\u2019s career, \u201che figured out a different skill set to call on.\u201d \u201cHe was an entirely different player,\u201d Curry said of Kidd\u2019s final few seasons, after Curry had come into the league, \u201cbut he was very impactful, in terms of orchestrating the offense, standing at the top of the key, finding the guy that was open, and knocking down an open three. He did that and got three extra years out of his career, and a championship.\u201d Indeed, Kidd hit some big threes, including a dagger with 1:26 to go in Game 5 of The Finals, along the Mavs\u2019 road to the 2011 title . And he wouldn\u2019t have been there without the work he put him years earlier. \u201cIt goes to his mentality,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cIt goes to his intelligence.\u201d It was quite an evolution. \u201cPhoenix was great, because that\u2019s where I learned how to win,\u201d Kidd reflected. \u201cAnd then the timing of going to New Jersey was probably playing at the best that I had played in my career. In the same breath, to be older in Dallas and still have an effect on the game, not being the main guy, not being quick or able to score, but still, mentally, being able to have an impact.\u201d It\u2019s a Hall-of-Fame career, and in every phase, Kidd\u2019s impact was felt. He was an elite athlete, an MVP candidate, a guy who made his team better on both ends of the floor, and one of the smartest players the league has ever seen. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

As he closes in on his 35th birthday next year, though, the former Miami Heat and Toronto Raptors star says the time for his return to the NBA may be dwindling. In an interview with Yahoo Sports\u2019 Ben Rohrbach, Bosh said the time for retirement may come before he gets another shot in the NBA . This self-imposed deadline Bosh has determined is perhaps based on two key dates in the 2018-19 season: Feb. 7, 2019 (the NBA trade deadline) and March 1 (the NBA\u2019s playoff eligibility waiver deadline). Those are the points in which playoff teams tend to gear up for a postseason run, and, in some cases, add players in the free-agent pool for that push. Bosh hasn\u2019t played in the NBA since the 2015-16 season due to blood-clotting issues . Earlier this year, he had hopes of signing with a playoff-contending team for the 2018 postseason . To date, though, Bosh remains without a team and last played in an NBA game on Feb. 9, 2016 as a member of the Miami Heat . Bosh told Rohrbach that he understands why teams may be tentative about the idea of signing him, especially given the tragic death of former Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis in 1993 .

Here\u2019s more from Feigen on the trade : Chriss, the eighth overall pick of the 2016 NBA Draft , is coming off a disappointing sophomore season in which he lost a starting spot on the league-worst Suns. The two-year forward saw his offensive production and efficiency drop after a rookie year in which he averaged 9.2 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. Knight, meanwhile, is coming off ACL surgery that kept him sidelined for all of 2017-18 .

The Atlanta Hawks and the insurance company announced Wednesday they have reached a 20-year deal on the naming rights for the arena, which is currently in the final phase of its renovation. The arena is expected to reopen in October as the Hawks celebrate their 50th year in Atlanta. The Hawks had played in Philips Arena since its opening in 1999. The State Farm red logo will be displayed at the top of the arena, which might be one of the smallest-capacity NBA venues with 17,600 seats. Its amenities will include a new state-of-the-art video board system, three times larger than the current one, along rapper Killer Mike\u2019s barbershop, Zack Brown\u2019s BBQ restaurant, a fantasy golf area, club lounge and premium seating areas with couches and cabanas. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a social place unlike anywhere else in the NBA,\u201d Hawks CEO Steve Koonin told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cAll of our research told us that people don\u2019t want to sit down in a chair eating a hot dog out of aluminum foil and watch a game.

James says he has lost popularity from speaking out on issues, but said he feels he must do so because he has an opportunity to inspire others with his words. ESPN.com has more from James in the latest episode of \u201cThe Shop\u201d: At NBA All-Star 2018 in Los Angeles, James spoke publicly after Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized the three-time NBA champion for his recent comments about social issues. James previously responded with an Instagram post containing similar sentiments. \u201cWe will definitely not shut up and dribble,\u201d James said then. \u201cI will definitely not do that.

I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don\u2019t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they\u2019re in.\u201d James made his initial public comments in question during a video segment on Uninterrupted, a platform co-founded by James. He was joined by Kevin Durant, and both superstars were sharply critical of President Donald Trump and the nation\u2019s racial climate. James referenced Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Bill Russell and Jackie Robinson as athletes who previously spoke up for equality and change with no concerns about the consequences or any rewards. \u201cWe know it\u2019s bigger than us,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about us.

When Ginobili was on the floor, it wasn\u2019t that he was cocky or didn\u2019t respect his competitors. He did. But he would try anything, at any time. Score or the \u201crules\u201d of basketball didn\u2019t apply; if he was open, he let it fly. His will to compete was as good as any of the all-time greats. There is no 2005 title for San Antonio without Ginobili\u2019s performance down the stretch in Game 7 against the Pistons, and it was a testament to the emotional makeup of the Spurs that Tim Duncan, afterward, was clear that it was Manu who won it for them. Steve Aschburner :  How he built this terrific, widely respected Hall of Fame-worthy career while starting a total of 349 NBA games over 16 seasons. That\u2019s one-third of his 1,057 appearances, in a league where starting vs. coming off the bench is one of the most emotional and drama-filled issues players and coaches face. Didn\u2019t matter to Ginobili, who was fine playing the role asked of him by the Spurs. He wound up with twice as many rings (four) as All-Star appearances, and per-36 stats through the prime of his particular career (age 27 to 34) that screamed all-NBA: 20.8 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 5.3 apg, 1.8 spg. He was a poster guy for the old coaching bromide that it\u2019s not who starts, it\u2019s who finishes \u2013 even though most players of Ginobili\u2019s caliber would have hissy fits over his bench status. Shaun Powell :  What\u2019s unforgettable is how Manu never cheated his team or teammates or coaches or fans or Argentina at any time. He gave his all in every game, be it NBA or international play. He stayed in great shape and showed up at tip-off. Never saw him take a possession off. If he made a poor decision with the ball, he usually followed with a better one. Ultimate teammate, ultimate competitor. There is no higher compliment. John Schuhmann :  The spirit with which he played the game. He came from a soccer nation, but had an undeniable passion for the sport of basketball, and passed that passion to to his countrymen. Two of the most memorable moments in the last 20 years of international hoops, because of the emotions that they evoked, were Argentina\u2019s win at the 2004 Olympics and Ginobili\u2019s farewell in Rio two years ago. He was a complete player, a terrific scorer and a solid defender. And after the retirements of Jason Kidd and Steve Nash, Ginobili had the best vision in the league, seeing passes that others didn\u2019t (and having the chutzpah to make them). He was a joy to watch. Sekou Smith :  Manu\u2019s fearlessness and competitive spirit always resonated with me and always will . He didn\u2019t hit the NBA with some presumptuous game or attitude in regards to his fit after becoming a star elsewhere. He stayed true to the unique style that made him an international star and forced his way into the elite category of championship competitors in the league with repeated big time performances on the biggest stages. His work with the golden group from his native Argentina only served to drive home those same feelings I had about his fearlessness and competitive spirit. He was a true showman, a guy who played the game in an unorthodox but beautiful way that elevated the action when he was on the floor. * * *"},{"id":38900,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-manu-ginobili-slam-dunk-hall-fame","date":"2018-08-28","title":"Blogtable: Is Manu Ginobili a first-ballot Hall of Fame selection?","content":"* * * Four-time NBA champion, Olympic Gold Medalist, EuroLeague MVP.

Of course he\u2019s first-ballot. Steve Aschburner :  First ballot, no debate . Ginobili\u2019s credentials just from his NBA career are deserving of that respect, but his work internationally makes the case indisputable. Especially since the Naismith Hall honors basketball across the board, from pro to amateur, from men to women, from domestic to overseas. Shaun Powell : From a purely statistical standpoint his numbers don\u2019t leap off the page. Yet understand that it\u2019s the \u201cBasketball Hall of Fame\u201d and therefore the criteria isn\u2019t the same (nor as difficult) as with some other Halls. Manu covers a lot of bases, checks a lot of boxes. He\u2019s a slam dunk because of his longevity, his international play, his gold medal, his NBA championships. Few if any can match that. John Schuhmann :  Yes. Even if you just took his NBA career into account, he would clearly be deserving of induction . He doesn\u2019t rank in the top 100 all-time in points, rebounds or assists, but mostly because he was willing to accept a bench role so early in his career. Over 16 seasons, he was one of the best players on a team that won 71 percent of its games (like averaging 58 wins). He won four championships and has the fourth highest plus-minus over the 22 seasons (including playoffs) for which we have play-by-play data , despite playing only 60 percent of the minutes that the top three guys \u2014 Tim Duncan, LeBron James and Dirk Nowitzki \u2014 (have) played over that time. Sekou Smith :  Slam-dunk, first-team Hall of Famer if there ever was one. He\u2019s got it all, from the titles at every stop to the individual accolades to the longevity and the overall impact you want a Hall of Fame player to have possessed. It\u2019s not even up for debate, as far as I\u2019m concerned.

As the Spurs enter the next chapter in their history, how much longer can we expect to see Gregg Popovich coaching the team?  * * * David Aldridge :  Pop may surprise us all . As with everything about him these days, there\u2019s no way for anyone other than him to know what\u2019s in his heart emotionally after the death of his wife . And I wouldn\u2019t speculate on that here. So whether he throws himself into his work, or decides it\u2019s time to be with the grands full-time is something none of us can guess at. I do think he loves not only teaching and competing, but being with his staff and with his network of friends and associates around the league, and may not be ready to walk away from \u201cthe hang\u201d of pro basketball. Steve Aschburner :  Two years from now, Popovich will take Team USA to Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Games. Presumably, he\u2019ll steer that crew to a gold medal. He\u2019ll be 71, closing in on 72. That\u2019s not so very old, but with the Spurs coming down to the NBA pack and his legacy guys gone and\/or retired, the 2020-21 season would seem like a swell time for Popovich to take a final lap through the NBA. Which, of course, he\u2019d hate for all the attention it would focus on him, so \u2013 just a hunch \u2013 I\u2019m thinking that Olympic championship game is the last one we see him coach . Shaun Powell :  Pop is done after the 2019-20 season . I see a seamless transition from NBA coach to Olympic coach that fall. He can satisfy his urge to coach in every World Championship and Olympic year. Between those events, he can get his fill with a bottle of wine. John Schuhmann :  I won\u2019t venture to guess. Only Popovich or those really close to him could know the answer to that question, and maybe he doesn\u2019t know just yet. Heck, Ginobili took four months (since the Spurs were eliminated) to make his decision, and a player has to answer to his body a lot more than a coach does. Sekou Smith :  Before seeing Pop in the flesh last month in Las Vegas during USA Basketball\u2019s summer gathering, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how much longer he would last coaching the Spurs. The key players from the dynasty have all either retired or vacated the premises. And Pop has clearly endured personal strife that would cause anyone to reassess their priorities. But his energy with the players in Vegas jumped out at me. He was in a great space being around the present and future stars of the game and they reciprocated that same energy. I could easily see him sticking around for another three or four seasons in San Antonio as we find out just how strong \u201cThe Spurs Way\u201d culture is without a superstar anchor.  * * *"},{"id":38894,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-reacts-manu-ginobili-retirement","date":"2018-08-28","title":"NBA reacts to Manu Ginobili's retirement","content":" When a legend retires , the NBA world notices.

But with LeBron James having left Cleveland for the Lakers, and their All-Star guards back to full strength, expectations are soaring in Boston. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about about the upcoming season with (Irving and Hayward back),\u201d Ainge said. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a transition from rehabbing to playing 1-on-1 to playing 3-on-3 to 5-on-5 and then playing NBA basketball, so I don\u2019t want to build up expectations too high. I think there will be a little bit of an adjustment once that last phase is made. \u201cBut, physically, they look great and I think they\u2019re very excited about the upcoming year.\u201d"},{"id":38912,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/manu-ginobili-retires-after-16-seasons-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2018-08-27","title":"Manu Ginobili, 4-time champion with San Antonio Spurs, retires at 41","content":"SAN ANTONIO \u2014 Manu Ginobili has played his final game, and with that a new era awaits the San Antonio Spurs. Ginobili announced his decision to retire on Monday, the 41-year-old wrapping up what he called a \u201cfabulous journey\u201d in which he helped the Spurs win four NBA championships in 16 seasons with the club. The smooth left-handed guard from Argentina came to San Antonio in 2002, forming what quickly became a powerful \u201cBig 3\u201d alongside Tim Duncan and Tony Parker. Now, they\u2019ve all moved on: Duncan retired two years ago, Parker left San Antonio earlier this summer as a free agent to sign with the Charlotte Hornets, and Ginobili has worn Spurs colors for the last time as well. \u201cToday, with a wide range of feelings, I\u2019m announcing my retirement from basketball,\u201d Ginobili wrote on Twitter in making the announcement. \u201cIMMENSE GRATITUDE to everyone (family, friends, teammates, coaches, staff, fans) involved in my life in the last 23 years. It\u2019s been a fabulous journey. Way beyond my wildest dreams.\u201d The image Ginobili chose to accompany that tweet: A photo of him walking off the floor, away from the camera, with four fingers aloft \u2014 signifying his four titles. \u201cAn NBA champion and All-Star, Manu Ginobili is also a pioneer who helped globalize the NBA,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cHe is one of basketball\u2019s greatest ambassadors who believes in the power of sports to change lives. And for 16 years, we were fortunate to watch a legend compete at the highest level. Thank you, Manu, for a career that inspired millions of people around the world.\u201d Ginobili\u2019s pro career lasted 23 seasons in all, starting with stints in Italy and his native Argentina. His drawing power was massive even in his final season, and it was common for him to spend plenty of time before road games posing for photos and signing autographs for fans \u2014 often international fans who came out to proudly display an Argentinian flag. \u201cA role model for all of us that love this wonderful sport,\u201d Spurs forward Pau Gasol said. Duncan, Parker, Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard were the backbone of San Antonio\u2019s drive to its most recent NBA championship in 2014, and this will be the first time that Gregg Popovich begins a season as the Spurs\u2019 head coach with none of those players on the roster. Leonard was traded to the Toronto Raptors for DeMar DeRozan earlier this summer, the end of a relationship in San Antonio that had apparently gone too sour to save. Leonard\u2019s departure meant Ginobili would have been the last player tied to the Spurs\u2019 title years. But in the end, retirement was the call. \u201cGreat player. Fierce competitor. Winner,\u201d Dallas star Dirk Nowitzki said on Twitter. \u201cNext stop: HOF.\u201d Indeed, getting enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame would seem like a certainty for Ginobili. The No. 57 pick in the 1999 draft, Ginobili averaged 13.3 points and 3.8 assists in 1,057 regular-season games. He was a two-time All-Star and was the league\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year for the 2007-08 season (getting 123 of 124 votes), plus he teamed with Popovich for 135 playoff wins \u2013 the third-highest total for any player-coach combo in NBA history. The only two with more? Popovich and Duncan won 157, and Popovich and Parker won 137. \u201cThanks for all you did for the game gramps,\u201d Spurs forward Rudy Gay tweeted, poking fun at Ginobili\u2019s age. Gay\u2019s sentiment was shared by many in the NBA, and the Spurs quickly put up a page of on- and off-the-court highlights that bore the simplest of messages: \u201cGracias, Manu.\u201d Ginobili, even though he was often coming off the bench, has a resume of postseason production like almost no one else in NBA history. Only two players have more than 800 rebounds, 800 assists and 300 3-pointers in their playoff careers \u2014 Ginobili and LeBron James. \u201cThank you for what you have done for your fellow lefties and a bringing an unmatched level of creativity to the game,\u201d Atlanta\u2019s Kent Bazemore wrote to Ginobili in a tweet. \u201cMuch respect.\u201d Ginobili\u2019s final game was April 24, when the Spurs were ousted from the Western Conference playoffs by the eventual champion Golden State Warriors. San Antonio lost the series 4-1. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was once a teammate of Ginobili\u2019s in San Antonio. And as Golden State celebrated moving on to the second round, Kerr offered Ginobili a sales pitch. \u201cKeep going, OK? Why not?\u201d Kerr told Ginobili that day at Oracle Arena as they shared an embrace. \u201cHey, we met Roger Federer this year in China. I said `Why do you keep playing?\u2019 He said `I love it.\u2019 If you love it, keep going.\u201d Moments later, Ginobili left an NBA court as a player for the last time."},{"id":38908,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-philadelphia-76ers-deliberate-search-new-general-manager","date":"2018-08-27","title":"Report: Philadelphia 76ers deliberate in search for new general manager","content":" The Philadelphia 76ers, without a general manager since the firing of Bryan Colangelo in June , are comfortable going into the next season without a permanent hire team managing partner Josh Harris told ESPN in an interview .

Stewart, who earlier this month was announced as the AP Player of the Year, is the second Seattle player to win MVP. Lauren Jackson was named MVP three times in her career. Stewart said it\u2019s been a transformative year for her, beginning with the revelation late last year she was sexually abused as a child. She has partnered with RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) to raise awareness and has met with members of the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center. \u201dThis year was made possible by going through really hard things.

At least not yet. Carter signed a one-year veteran minimum contract Friday with the rebuilding Atlanta Hawks, his eighth team, in what could be his final stop before starting a career in broadcasting. \u2022 Official Release: Atlanta Hawks Sign Vince Carter It appears to be the right mix for Carter, the league\u2019s oldest active player. He turns 42 in January and wants to be ready for a television job when his playing days end. Atlanta, home to Turner Broadcasting and NBA TV, is the right place to be, but Carter isn\u2019t quite ready to announce his retirement. \u201cI know playing this game that the media and the fans and people can be cruel,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re old and you\u2019re playing against guys half your age. You shouldn\u2019t be out here.\u2019 But then for me that is my goal, to prove that I\u2019m able to do that. And I put in a lot of work in mentally as well as physically just preparing myself.\u201d Carter says the once-dynamic dunker, a live highlight reel of a player known as \u201cVinsanity,\u201d still lives inside him. It\u2019s just different now that he\u2019s been a reserve in stops the last six seasons with Dallas, Memphis and Sacramento. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m still the same person,\u201d said Carter, the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year and an eight-time All-Star. \u201cMy approach is still the same. My work ethic, my ability to play the game is still the same. Obviously it\u2019s limited. You just don\u2019t get to see it as much, but it\u2019s the same guy.\u201d He wanted to play for the Hawks because they offered a chance to earn extra minutes. Atlanta is likely to be among the league\u2019s worst teams this season and will begin training camp Sept. 25 with Taurean Prince, John Collins, Dewayne Dedmon, Kent Bazemore and either Trae Young or Jeremy Lin as its starting five. Carter says he and new coach Lloyd Pierce have been texting each other frequently since Carter agreed to a contract late last month. They already know what his role will be, to mentor Prince, Collins and Young \u2014 the three core players the Hawks are building around \u2013 and to lead by example. He did much of the same last season with the Kings, averaging 5.4 points and 2.6 rebounds in 58 games for a team that finished 27-55. The Hawks figure to win far fewer games, but Carter believes the long-term plan looks promising. \u201cThe makeup and the makeover of what this organization is trying to do is positive,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the right direction. We live in a world where we want it right now, but the reality is that sometimes it doesn\u2019t happen that way. The potential is there to put the pieces together. My job is to come in and be like, \u2018Yeah, I might not be here a couple of years but if I can help lay some foundation and some ideas to lead them in the right direction, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.'\u201d Carter isn\u2019t the oldest player to ever play for the Hawks. Kevin Willis, Carter\u2019s teammate in Toronto from 1998-2001, spent his first nine-plus seasons in Atlanta before returning at 42. The Hawks went 13-69 and had the NBA\u2019s worst record. If something that bad happens again, Carter says he won\u2019t complain. For years he\u2019s passed up on chances to sign with a contender and chase that championship ring he never won. And it\u2019s not like he needs the money after earning over $160 million in his career . \u201cTo just sit on the end of the bench, I just can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who I am. I guess I\u2019ve been around long enough, and what\u2019s engrained in me and what\u2019s been instilled in me, that\u2019s not my thing.\u201d Carter describes himself as a longtime veteran who has a coach\u2019s mentality but doesn\u2019t want to coach. \u201cI love to play, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a young guy\u2019s mentality with a 40-year-old body.\u201d And a potential Hall of Fame candidate who has his eyes set on becoming the NBA\u2019s next broadcaster with a household name. He\u2019s already worked as a guest analyst for NBA Summer League and high-profile youth games. TNT could be his next step. \u201cI have a fear of when it\u2019s over not being prepared for the next phase,\u201d Carter said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m nearing the end, whenever that is, I want to make sure when that door is closed and I leave my basketball shoes in the gym or where I choose to leave them, I\u2019m ready for the next phase.\u201d"},{"id":38916,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-kyrie-irving-mothers-sioux-tribe-north-dakota","date":"2018-08-23","title":"Kyrie Irving, sister officially welcomed into mother's Sioux tribe","content":"FORT YATES, N.D.  (AP) \u2014 Boston Celtics star Kyrie Irving and his older sister were officially welcomed into their mother\u2019s Standing Rock Sioux tribe on Thursday. The All-Star guard and his sister, model Asia Irving, visited the tribe\u2019s reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border and took part in a ceremony recognizing their tribal heritage and support for the tribe\u2019s long battle against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. In front of a packed auditorium, they were honored with Lakota names during a ritual that tribal spokeswoman Danielle Finn said \u201cis a very special rite of passage for a Lakota person.\u201d While standing on a bison pelt, the siblings were smudged with sacred grasses, presented with traditional quilts and eagle feathers, and given names associated with their White Mountain family. Kyrie Irving\u2019s Lakota name, Hela, is roughly pronounced (HAY\u2019-law) and means \u201cLittle Mountain.\u201d Asia Irving\u2019s name, Tatanka Winyan, (tuh-TONG\u2019-kuh WEE\u2019-yun) means \u201cBuffalo Woman.\u201d The Irvings\u2019 late mother, Elizabeth Ann Larson, was a member of the tribe and lived on the reservation until her adoption at a young age. Their late grandmother and great-grandparents also have ties to the reservation. The siblings were greeted by hordes of fans, many wearing green T-shirts with the Standing Rock Sioux seal, Kyrie Irving\u2019s uniform number, 11, and the words \u201cWelcome Home Kyrie Irving.\u201d \u201cIt truly is a good day for Standing Rock,\u201d tribal Chairman Mike Faith said, turning to the Irvings. \u201cFor you two, welcome home.\u201d Many in the crowd, including Char White Mountain, consider the siblings to be part of their family. \u201cWe want him to know who his relatives are,\u201d she said. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want him to think we\u2019re people using him for his money. He\u2019s family.\u201d Jewel Felix, who considers Kyrie Irving her nephew, said she became emotional when she heard he was coming. \u201cI started crying,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening.\u201d Todd Giroux, a 14-year-old high school junior and point guard for the Standing Rock basketball team, said Irving became his hero when the star gave him an autograph at a Celtics game against the Timberwolves in Minneapolis. Giroux came to Thursday\u2019s event wearing an Irving jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said, adding \u201cit makes it even cooler\u201d that Irving in late 2016 expressed support on Twitter for tribal efforts to lead the battle against the pipeline, which opponents believe threatens the tribe\u2019s Missouri River water supply. Thousands of people traveled to the reservation area in 2016 and 2017 to protest, with hundreds being arrested. The pipeline began operating in June 2017, but the Standing Rock tribe is leading a court battle to try to shut it down. Kyrie Irving discussed his Sioux heritage during a January 2017 interview with ESPN, saying \u201cthere\u2019s a home connection\u201d with the tribe\u2019s pipeline struggles and that he wanted to have a legacy outside of basketball. Irving this year asked Nike to put Standing Rock\u2019s seal on a new sneaker. He also has a tattoo of the Standing Rock logo on his neck. Irving, who won an NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, was born in Australia and grew up in West Orange, New Jersey. He played one season at Duke University before joining the Cavaliers as the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft."},{"id":38907,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/miami-heat-pat-riley-plans-meet-soon-dwyane-wade","date":"2018-08-23","title":"Pat Riley still wants to bring back Dwyane Wade, Udonis Haslem","content":" Future Hall of Fame guard Dwyane Wade made it clear a few weeks ago that if he suits up for the 2018-19 season , he\u2019ll only do so with the Miami Heat. Wade is an unrestricted free agent this summer and has yet to commit to Miami, but it seems he will soon talk with team president Pat Riley about what his intentions are. Riley met with Miami-area media today at the groundbreaking for the Miami Heat Sports Medicine Center in Coral Gables . While he was there, he said he plans to meet with Wade soon. Here\u2019s more from Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel : If the Heat were to re-sign Wade, their salary cap position would mean they could offer him either the $5.3 million taxpayer mid-level exception and the $2.4 million veteran\u2019s minimum. Winderman notes that the difference between the options is significant, with signing Wade to the the $5.3 million taxpayer mid-level exception resulting in an actual cash outlay of $14.2 million in 2018-19. That is because, Winderman writes, the Heat would move into the second level of the tax multiplier. A smaller contract for Wade, however, would allow the Heat to get out of the tax by the end of next season \u2014 which is when the luxury tax is formally calculated. When asked if the Heat were willing to offer Wade the mid-level, tax-payer exception to get Wade to re-sign, Riley said: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about negotiating a mid-level or dollars. It\u2019s about getting Dwyane back. It\u2019s not really about the tax right now, even though we have a tax situation. \u201cWe\u2019ll work our way around that. We have 14 months or 12 months to deal with the situation. We just want to get started \u2026 get back on the floor. It\u2019s been five months [since Miami\u2019s season ended] \u2026 get to training camp, play our preseason games and start the season. We want Dwyane to be a part of that. All the business aspects of the tax and the cap, that\u2019s all part of the equation. Just get the team together.\u201d As for a timeframe for this to all get done, Riley said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait \u2019til after Labor Day. I think that\u2019s always sort of the drop-dead date for players.\u201d Wade isn\u2019t the only Heat legend in free agency who is awaiting a possible return to Miami this summer. Reports recently circulated that the Heat and stalwart forward Udonis Haslem are moving toward a deal . If Haslem returns for \u201918-19, it would mark his 16th season in Miami. Riley sounded confident today about keeping Haslem in the fold, reports Winderman ( via Twitter ) and The Associated Press\u2019 Tim Reynolds ( via Twitter ). Wade was wooed by a team in China with a lucrative contract this summer, but said last weekend, Wade made it clear that if he does play in 2018-19, it will only be for the Heat . Earlier in the offseason, Haslem had said he would be open to playing overseas if he could not work out a deal with the Heat for next season. Haslem\u2019s role for Miami has steadily diminished over the last three seasons and in 2017-18, he logged career lows in minutes (5.1 per game), points (0.6), rebounds (0.7) and field goal percentage (20.0). Undrafted in 2002, Haslem spent his first pro season in France before signing with the Heat as a free agent in 2003. He is Miami\u2019s career leader in rebounds with 5,711 , and has appeared in 844 regular-season games \u2014 33 shy of Wade\u2019s record. He\u2019s also seventh on the Heat scoring list (6,486 career points). Among active players, only the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Dirk Nowitzki and the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Manu Ginobili have spent the entirety of a career spanning at least 15 years with one franchise. Former Spurs guard Tony Parker had also logged at least 15 years with the team, but left San Antonio this summer in free agency to sign with the Charlotte Hornets .

After an offseason of some roster upheaval, it seems that Ginobili could be another name that may not suit up for San Antonio\u2019s opening night game on Oct. 17 . ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Ginobili is seriously considering retirement as the new season looms and that the guard will soon meet with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to discuss his future plans . Tom Orsborn of the San Antonio Express-News reports that Ginobili\u2019s brother said Manu could make an announcement on his future this week : Over the summer, the Spurs lost several key players via trades ( Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green ) or free agency ( Tony Parker and Kyle Anderson ). Ginobili is a fan favorite in San Antonio and is one of the most accomplished international players in basketball history.

The six-time All-Star and former Finals MVP moved on from the only NBA city he had known this summer, joining the Charlotte Hornets as a free agent . There seemed to be no hard feelings on either side over that parting and, once his career is over, Parker plans to return to San Antonio at least one last time. In an interview with the Chinese web site HUPU , Parker made it clear he plans to retire with the Spurs when his playing days are through. Jeff Garcia of News4SA.com has more : Parker is expected to backup All-Star guard Kemba Walker \u2014 who is entering his final year of his contract \u2014 in Charlotte. Parker hoped to make it an even 20 seasons with the Spurs , which would have required the team to re-sign him for three years. Parker willingly gave up his starting role to youngster Dejounte Murray last season. In his final season with the Spurs, Parker played 55 games averaged 7.7 points and 3.5 assists. During his career, the six-time All-Star averaged 15.8 points and 5.7 assists. He was part of 137 playoff wins with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, the second most by any coach and player in NBA history. Popovich and Spurs star Tim Duncan combined for 157 playoff wins. Parker was part of the Spurs\u2019 Big Three with Duncan and Manu Ginobili. Duncan has retired, Parker is now gone and Ginobili\u2019s status for next season remains unknown. Parker has also appeared in 17 consecutive postseasons; only Karl Malone and John Stockton\u2019s run of 19 straight playoff trips are longer. The move reunites Parker with new Charlotte coach James Borrego, who most recently was an assistant in San Antonio. And Parker is close friends with Charlotte\u2019s Nicolas Batum, who predictably was thrilled by the news. \u201dNumber 9, I see you soon in Buzz City my big bro,\u201d Batum wrote on Twitter.

Perhaps lost in that shuffle was the team\u2019s re-signing of veteran swingman Rudy Gay , who opted out of his contract and briefly was a free agent this summer. Gay will be playing with an old friend in DeRozan, whom Gay played with in Toronto for nearly a year in 2013 before Gay was dealt to the Sacramento Kings . Some are pointing to the Spurs\u2019 trading of Leonard as a reason San Antonio might slip in the Western Conference hierarchy. Gay sees the opposite, though, and is confident the Spurs come 2018-19. Tom Orsborn of the San Antonio Express-News caught up with Gay at his basketball showcase in Maryland to talk about his health, DeRozan, the season and more : Recent over\/under odds by the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas have the Spurs at 43.5 wins, which, if realized, would likely keep the Spurs out of the playoff mix in 2019.

Since then, the Clippers have shared the Staples Center with the Los Angeles Lakers. Two years ago, news broke that the Clippers and their owner, Steve Ballmer, were looking to leave Staples for a building of their own in the near future . Last year, the city of Inglewood unanimously approved an exclusive negotiating agreement with the Clippers that could lead to the construction of an arena near the future home of the NFL\u2019s LA Rams and LA Chargers. Ballmer hasn\u2019t let up on his desire to get that arena plan done and, in a meeting with Clippers fans and season ticker holders yesterday, once again talked of how important it is for the Clippers to have their own arena. The Los Angeles Times \u2018 Helene Elliott has more from Ballmer, who spoke at a team event called \u201cThe Playbook.\u201d That event featured Ballmer, team president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank and team consultant Jerry West: As the Clippers close in on the 2018-19 season, gone are many of the familiar faces from the team\u2019s \u201cLob City\u201d era. The Clippers traded All-Star point guard Chris Paul to the Houston Rockets before 2017-18 opened , dealt high-flying star forward Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons at midseason and watched as center DeAndre Jordan signed with the Dallas Mavericks in free agency this summer. Despite all the roster overhaul of late, Ballmer told fans yesterday he won\u2019t allow his team to bottom out and gut the roster in hopes of a quick turnaround or high Draft pick. The Clippers looked to make up for some of their roster changes this summer, trading for Washington Wizards center Marcin Gortat, drafting Jerome Robinson with the No. 13 overall pick and landing No. 11 pick Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in a Draft-day trade with the Charlotte Hornets. Those moves \u2014 combined with a core of players that includes Tobias Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Avery Bradley and Patrick Beverley \u2014 has the Clippers thinking a playoff push could be possible in 2018-19. From the sound of some fans at Thursday\u2019s event, the plan Ballmer has in mind is one they believe in. The agreement between the Clippers and the city of Inglewood call for a three-year negotiating period, including a six-month extension, with a developer to build a state-of-the-art basketball arena with 18,000 to 20,000 seats. It requires the Clippers to pay a non-refundable $1.5 million deposit to cover costs associated with the planning. The proposed arena would be on a 20-acre parcel of land located across the street from the under-construction, $2.6 billion NFL stadium that is set to open in 2020. The Clippers\u2019 complex would include team offices, parking and a practice facility. The land is currently occupied by a variety of businesses. The Clippers have a lease to play at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles through 2024. However, Ballmer has been open about his desire for a new arena since he bought the Clippers for $2 billion in 2014 . The Clippers share Staples with the Los Angeles Lakers, the NHL\u2019s Kings and the WNBA\u2019s Sparks, leaving the Clippers third in choice of dates. Rams owner Stan Kroenke is privately financing the NFL stadium as part of a 698-acre mixed-use development that includes housing, retail and entertainment.

After re-signing Wayne Ellington and Derrick Jones Jr., the Heat have more or less ensured last season\u2019s roster will be in tact for 2018-19. Another move to keep a familiar face in the Miami fold seems to be on the way as well, too. According to Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel and Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald , the Heat are working to secure a deal that will keep longtime forward Udonis Haslem in South Florida. Here\u2019s more from Winderman on the Haslem-Heat pact in the works: Jackson reports if and when Haslem re-signs with the Heat, the veteran big man is expected to receive the $2.4 million veteran\u2019s minimum. The Heat continue to wait on what another team legend, guard Dwyane Wade, will do next season. Wade is a free agent and had been wooed by a team in China with a lucrative contract this summer. However, last weekend, Wade made it clear that if he does play in 2018-19, it will only be for the Heat . Earlier in the offseason, Haslem had said he would be open to playing overseas if he could not work out a deal with the Heat for next season. Haslem\u2019s role for Miami has steadily diminished over the last three seasons and in 2017-18, he logged career lows in minutes (5.1 per game), points (0.6), rebounds (0.7) and field goal percentage (20.0). Undrafted in 2002, Haslem spent his first pro season in France before signing with the Heat as a free agent in 2003. He is Miami\u2019s career leader in rebounds with 5,711 , and has appeared in 844 regular-season games \u2014 33 shy of Wade\u2019s record. He\u2019s also seventh on the Heat scoring list (6,486 career points). Among active players, only the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Dirk Nowitzki and the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Manu Ginobili have spent the entirety of a career spanning at least 15 years with one franchise.

Now, as D\u2019Antoni and Anthony begin a new chapter in their relationship, D\u2019Antoni is envisioning the best for himself, Anthony and the Rockets at large. In an interview with USA Today \u2018s Sam Amick, D\u2019Antoni gave his thoughts on Anthony\u2019s addition, the future for the team and more : The 34-year-old Anthony joins a team led by reigning Kia MVP James Harden and star point guard Chris Paul. The Rockets hope the addition of Anthony will help them contend for their first title since 1995. They lost to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference finals last season. Anthony will get a fresh start in Houston after spending last season with the Thunder, with whom he averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 games. The third overall pick in the 2003 draft has averaged 24.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3 assists in a 15-year career that also included stints with the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks. The 6-foot-8 Anthony is a 10-time All-Star and has won three gold medals in the Olympics. He is USA Basketball\u2019s all-time leading scorer and rebounder. Anthony has averaged more than 20 points every year of his career except last season and led the NBA in scoring in 2012-13, when he averaged 28.7 points a game.

But how a team does in its first 20 games could determine how the rest of its season plays out. There are few teams going into the 2018-19 schedule with no intention of being competitive. But at some point, a handful of teams will realize that they are not making the playoffs and that the long-term future is more of a priority than winning games in February and March. The point at which a bad team should realize that it is a bad team is earlier than it might admit. History tells us that a team needs to have a certain number of wins through 20 games to have realistic hopes of making the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference over the last 15 seasons, a 9-11 team through 20 games has been much more likely to reach the playoffs than an 8-12 team. In the West, the threshold has been higher. Over the last 15 seasons, an 11-9 team has been much more likely to make the Western Conference playoffs than one that started 10-10. On the morning of Nov. 28 last season, the Wolves (12-8) were one win ahead of the Nuggets (11-8) in the standings, and Denver would lose Game No. 20 that night. And when Minnesota won that overtime game on April 11 , it finished one win ahead of Denver . The Oklahoma City Thunder overcame an 8-12 start in the West last season, but over the last 15 seasons, only four of the 79 teams that won fewer than seven of their first 20 games went on to make the playoffs. All four were in the East. History tells us that those first 20 games will tell us a lot, even though early schedules can be unbalanced. The Portland Trail Blazers will be on the wrong side of early imbalance this year, with the league\u2019s toughest first 20 games in regard to cumulative opponent win percentage from last season. The Blazers will play 15 of their first 20 games against teams that had winning records in 2017-18 , and three of the other five are against the team \u2014 *the Lakers \u2014 that added LeBron James this summer. * Because of the adjustments that the Lakers will be going through, you could certainly make the argument that playing them three times in their first 14 games is a good thing. The final Blazers-Lakers meeting will take place in L.A. on the second-to-last night of the season. The Blazers\u2019 first 20 games include a six-game, 11-day homestand, but also trips of four and six games. The 20-game stretch includes three games where the Blazers will be at a *rest disadvantage and only one where they\u2019ll have a rest advantage (against New Orleans on Nov. 1). * A rest advantage or disadvantage is when one team is playing the second game of a back-to-back and the other didn\u2019t play the day before. Over the last three seasons, teams with a rest advantage are 624-438 (0.588), including 496-289 (0.632) at home. Home teams without a rest advantage have had a winning percentage of 0.571. Portland, which was the No. 3 seed last season but finished just three games ahead of the ninth-place Nuggets, lost three key members of what was the 11th-ranked bench . The Blazers will be playing in a deeper Western Conference, with the Lakers rising to the level of playoff contender. Every game counts, but it will be interesting to see how they navigate those first six weeks (as well as one of the league\u2019s longest road trips \u2014 see below). The same goes for the Utah Jazz , who have more road games (13) in their first 20 than any other team in the league, though Utah\u2019s first 20 games include three against Dallas, three against Memphis, and three against Sacramento. On the other end of the spectrum in the West are the Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder, who will have two of the conference\u2019s easiest starts to the season. The Nuggets will play 10 of their first 15 games at home and their first 19 includes five of the easiest home games \u2014 against Phoenix, Sacramento, Brooklyn, Atlanta and Orlando \u2014 they\u2019ll have all season. In their first 16 games, they\u2019ll have four with a rest advantage and only two with a disadvantage. The Thunder will play eight of their first 11 games against teams that had winning records last season, but will also play six of their first 16 against the Suns (3), Kings (2) and Knicks (1) \u2014 three teams that figure to finish at or near the bottom of the standings again this season. They\u2019ll also have all four of their meetings against the Hornets and Cavs in their first 20 games. Both Denver and OKC are looking to move up in the West, and relatively easy starts to the season could help them do that. Among teams that finished in the top 10 of the Eastern Conference last season , the Indiana Pacers have the toughest October-November schedule. Interestingly, the Pacers\u2019 first 20 games include half of their 16 games against the eight West teams that made the playoffs last season. And those eight include all six of their meetings against the Rockets, Spurs and Jazz. The highlight of the Pacers\u2019 early schedule is a three-game homestand from Nov. 3-7, with visits from the Celtics, Rockets and Sixers. The first game is the second of a road-home back-to-back for Indy, but the Boston and Philly meetings could give us an early clue as to whether the Pacers should be counted among the East\u2019s elite. Among Eastern Conference teams of consequence, the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers have the easiest starts. Both will play a league-high 12 of their first 20 games against teams that had losing records last season The Heat have an easier first 20 games in that 11 of them are at home and only three of their first nine road games are against teams that made the playoffs last season. In total, eight of the Heat\u2019s first 20 games are against the nine teams that finished with fewer than 30 wins . The Sixers will play seven of their first 20 games against that group, but their five back-to-backs in the first 20 are tied (with Brooklyn, Sacramento and Toronto) for the league high. Overall, the Sixers have the league\u2019s easiest (full) schedule in regard to opponent winning percentage last season , and they won\u2019t play in the Mountain or Pacific time zones until Game 36, when they visit Utah on Dec. 27. The Wizards have a tougher first 20 games in regard to opponent strength, but have six rest-advantage games (all at home) in that first 20 and won\u2019t play with a rest disadvantage until Game 32 on Dec. 19 in Houston. The Magic have four straight rest-advantage games (the longest such streak for any team this season) from Oct. 27 \u2013 Nov. 4. The 2018-19 schedule comes with another reduction in back-to-backs. This season, teams will average only 13.3 back-to-backs, down from 14.4 last season and 19.3 just four years ago. Teams will have no fewer than 12 and no more than 15 back-to-backs. In 2014-15, the range was 16-22. And along with a reduction in back-to-backs comes a reduction in rest-advantage games. This year, in only 300 of the 1,230 games will one of the teams be on the second night of a back-to-back while the other is rested. That\u2019s less than 25 percent of all games for the first time in at least the last 22 years. But there remains a bigger variance in the number of rest-advantage (and rest-disadvantage) games than there is in the number of back-to-backs. The Bulls and Knicks have only seven rest-advantage games, while the Clippers have 15. The good news for the Bulls is that they also have the fewest rest-disadvantage games (six), less than half as many as the Kings , who have a league-high 14. If you subtract rest-disadvantage games from rest-advantage games to get an overall \u201cadvantage factor\u201d for each team\u2019s 82 games, the Clippers (15 rest advantage games, 10 rest-disadvantage games) have the easiest schedule, followed by the Sixers (13, 9). Meanwhile, the Hornets (8, 13) and Knicks (7, 11) have the toughest. The Wolves \u2018 schedule is rather even in regard to rest-advantage and rest-disadvantage games (10 vs. nine), but they\u2019ll have just three back-to-backs in their first 35 games. And the opponents in the second game of the three back-to-backs are the Mavs, Clippers and Bulls.

Today, the former All-Star forward signed his deal with the team, the Rockets announced Monday afternoon. https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoustonRockets\/status\/1029058149569978368 According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Rockets were signing Anthony to his one-year, $2.4 million deal soon . Anthony was waived by the Atlanta Hawks on July 30, after being traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder on July 19. On Aug. 7, Charania confirmed Anthony and the Rockets verbally agreed to a deal that Anthony would eventually sign after an offseason trip to Africa. Anthony\u2019s lone season in Oklahoma City was largely a bust. He averaged 16.2 points and struggled at times in his new role alongside Russell Westbrook and Paul George. The 10-time All-Star posted career lows in scoring average and field goal percentage, and the Thunder were ousted in the first round of the playoffs by Utah. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2014 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2014 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs. In Game 6 of the first-round series against Utah that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season, he played fewer minutes than reserve Jerami Grant. After the season, he said he prefers to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201cout of the question.\u201d Anthony opted in earlier this summer to accept the $28 million he was due next season. The Thunder re-signed Grant, then it was reported that Anthony and the Thunder would eventually part ways, though it was unclear how it would happen. Anthony should help the Rockets fill their void at forward after the team lost Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute during free agency .

Porter Jr. entered college at Missouri last fall as one of the top prospects in his freshman class. But back woes limited him to just three appearances as he fell to Denver with the 14th pick in the 2018 draft. Diagnosed with two bulging discs, Porter Jr. said it wasn\u2019t until his second spinal surgery in July that he finally felt complete relief following an initial procedure last November. \u201cI don\u2019t have a date but I\u2019m hoping to be back for the beginning of the year,\u201d Porter Jr. told ESPN. \u201cGotta heal up, but I feel great.

The Golden State Warriors star, making his second appearance in the event at TPC Stonebrae, finished at 17-over 157 after opening with a 71 on Thursday. Curry was last among the 154 finishers \u2014 33 strokes behind leader Alex Prugh \u2014 and missed the cut by 13 strokes.

For me, it was just trying to take each shot and just have fun with it and trying to hit a good shot and not really get too down about the result if it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.\u201d Prugh matched the tour nine-hole record with a back-nine 27 in a 60 that left him 16 under. He birdied the first seven holes on the back nine, parred the 17th and birdied the 18th. \u201cMy putter has been a little streaky here and there, but when it\u2019s on, it\u2019s on,\u201d Prugh said. \u201cI\u2019ve been making putts and fortunately whenever that happens it makes everything easier. \u201d Prugh was two strokes short of the tour record of 58 set by Stephan Jaeger two years ago at TPC Stonebrae and one shot off Jaeger\u2019s 36-hole tour mark for strokes. Josh Teater was two strokes back after a 62. Curry played alongside Cameron Champ and Martin Trainer. Champ, the Utah Championship winner last month who leads the tour in driving distance, was tied for 42nd after rounds of 68 and 67.

Like any meticulous planner, I love knowing where I need to be on opening night ( Oracle Arena for ring night as the Oklahoma City Thunder visit), Christmas Day ( back at Oracle, where LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers hope to put a lump of coal in the Warriors\u2019 stocking) and Martin Luther King Jr. Day ( Memphis, for sentimental and basketball reasons ). But it\u2019s all those other days and nights filled with NBA action that need to be scoped out. And thankfully, today\u2019s release of the full 2018-19 season schedule provides an opportunity to make some plans for the 82-game marathon each team will run from Oct. 16 and April 10. Here are just a few of the must-see games on my list, which is sure to expand as the season progresses. (Note: The games are listed in no particular order and each has an explanation as to why it made the cut) * * * Houston Rockets vs. Los Angeles Lakers Oct. 20, 10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN Watch it because \u2026  The Staples Center debut for LeBron James is the No. 1 event on the sports and entertainment calendar \u2014 in the sports and entertainment center of the universe \u2014 now that LeBron has taken up residence in Brentwood, Calif. A veritable Who\u2019s Who of celebrities and influencers are sure to be in the building. Lakers fans around the globe have been clamoring for the day their beloved franchise returns to relevance. Well, this is officially the night the lights come back on for the Lakers. (And, yes, you might see LeBron and the Lakers on this list a few more times.) Toronto Raptors vs. San Antonio Spurs Jan. 3, 2019: 8 p.m. ET, TNT Watch it because \u2026  Kawhi Leonard\u2019s first (and potentially only) trip back to San Antonio. A heartfelt Dear San Antonio letter weeks after the Spurs granted his wishes and traded him away ( to Toronto \u2014 and not his desired Lakers) won\u2019t shield Leonard from the fury he\u2019ll surely face at the AT&T Center this night. Leonard was supposed to be the player who carried on \u201cThe Spurs Way\u201d from the Tim Duncan era into the future. It\u2019s still a bit tough to digest how quickly things came unraveled between Leonard and the Spurs . Anyone expecting there to be no hard feelings from the Spurs\u2019 home crowd is divorced from reality. Philadelphia 76ers vs. Boston Celtics Oct. 16: 8 p.m. ET, TNT  Watch it because \u2026  Boston Celtics forward Gordon  Hayward lasted a grand total of five minutes and 15 seconds in the Celtics\u2019 season opener last year before a gruesome leg injury ended his season . It was a cruel way to kick off his tenure in Boston, after he selected the Celtics in free agency in the summer of 2017. Seeing him flex his skills during the remix season opener this time around should be a feel-good moment for Hayward, the Celtics and their adoring fan base. * National TV schedule | Team-by-team schedules | More schedules Houston Rockets vs. Golden State Warriors Nov. 15 (in Houston): 8 p.m. ET, TNT Jan. 3, 2019 (in Oakland): 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT Feb. 23, 2019 (in Oakland): 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC Watch them because \u2026  We didn\u2019t stutter. Every. Single. One. Of. Them! Take your highlighter and circle all of the matchups between these two league (and Western Conference) titans. The former foes waged an epic Western Conference finals in 2018 and reunite three times in 2018-19. While statement games have been given short shrift during the Super Team era, you should expect Houston and Golden State to stalk other all season. There\u2019s no room for passive-aggressive behavior when the Rockets and Warriors threaten each other\u2019s NBA championship goals. Boston Celtics vs. Golden State Warriors Jan. 26, 2019 (in Boston): 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC March 5, 2019 (in Oakland): 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT Watch them because \u2026  When Boston heads to Oakland (and vice versa two months later), these are power showdowns you cannot miss . The Celtics will looking to make a statement of their own when they face the two-time defending NBA champs. And they should. The path has been cleared for them to take that final step and get back on The Finals. And what better way to measure their readiness for that than going after the Warriors? If the Celtics are built to combat what the Warriors do best, we\u2019ll see it these games (even if it is just two doses of them). San Antonio Spurs vs. Toronto Raptors Feb. 22, 2019: 7 p.m. ET, ESPN Watch it because \u2026  DeMar DeRozan\u2019s Toronto homecoming might be the one return visit for a star player that results in a genuine standing ovation. DeRozan\u2019s desire to finish his career with the franchise that drafted him has been well-documented in the wake of the shocking blockbuster deal that sent him to San Antonio in a package for All-Star Kawhi Leonard. Expect a raucous scene when he returns to Air Canada Centre and the bosom of a proud fan base that is sure to turn out (Drake included) for his one trip back to the Six. L.A. Lakers vs. Houston Rockets Dec. 13: 8 p.m. ET, TNT Jan. 19, 2019: 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC Watch them because \u2026  The Lakers\u2019 two visits to Houston will be tough ones to swallow for folks who dreamed of a potential semi- banana boat reunion for LeBron James and Chris Paul . They were talking about the possibilities during the first round of the playoffs on local sports talk stations, only to see LeBron meet with only the Lakers and Sixers before deciding to cast his lot with the Lakers . Seeing him in purple and gold in the flesh at Toyota Center will hammer home the choice he made. An that probably still won\u2019t keep the dreamers in Houston from thinking about what might have been. Los Angeles Lakers vs. Cleveland Cavaliers Nov. 21: 8 p.m. ET, ESPN Watch it because \u2026  You\u2019ll have to forgive fans in Northeast Ohio if they are struggling to muster the energy for this holiday season showdown. Hosting LeBron James and his new team on Thanksgiving eve gives Cavaliers fans a chance to process James\u2019 exit all over again \u2014 the second time the former Kia MVP bolted the Cavs in his career. To their credit, they\u2019ve handled his departure the second time around much better than they did when he left for the Miami Heat. On a side note, there has to be a visit to Akron and LeBron\u2019s I Promise School on the Lakers\u2019 travel itinerary, since this is their only known Ohio visit this season. Portland Trail Blazers vs. Utah Jazz Dec. 25: 10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN Watch it because \u2026  What can a surprising and breakout rookie season do for you in Salt Lake City? It can put your team on the radar as a host for one of the league\u2019s five coveted Christmas Day showcase games . How else do you explain Donovan Mitchell and the Jazz getting this Dec. 25 treat? Mitchell showcased himself as an ascending star both during his rookie season and especially as Utah reached the Western Conference semifinals . One of his rewards for all that is a heightened level of fame and a visit from the Blazers in Christmas\u2019 final game. Toronto Raptors vs. Los Angeles Lakers Nov. 4: 9:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Watch it because \u2026:  When the Raptors make their lone trip to play the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center, you have to believe the Lakers faithful will be eager to show him what could await him back home. (As of now, Leonard will be an unrestricted free agent next summer.) Those fans only get one shot to show Leonard, a Califorina native, how bad they really want him. Something tells me this won\u2019t be the only time the home crowd is pulling double duty (rooting for the Lakers while low-key recruiting help for LeBron\u2019s new crew). New Orleans Pelicans vs. Philadelphia 76ers Nov. 21: 7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Watch it because \u2026  The Sixers will have plenty to deal with when Anthony Davis and former Sixers All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday come to town. But the guy with the real chip on his shoulder might be Jahlil Okafor, one of the casualties of \u201cThe Process\u201d during his brief and tumultuous stint with the franchise. Everything Okafor thought he would be when the Sixers selected him with the third pick in the 2015 Draft is what Embiid has become. Okafor is just 22 and on a mission to revive his career with the Pelicans. Phoenix Suns vs. Dallas Mavericks April 9, 2019: 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Watch it because \u2026  Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s (potential) final call at American Airlines Center could very well be the last time he takes the floor in a league he helped reshape for international players . There has been no kind of official announcement that this will be his last season. But just in case, the season finale for the Mavericks is a must-see for fans around the globe. That he spent his entire (Hall of Fame) career in one place is even more impressive given the times where hardly any player simply stays put. Milwaukee Bucks vs. Philadelphia 76ers April 4, 2019: 8 p.m. ET, TNT Watch it because \u2026  Giannis Antetokounmpo has already served notice that he\u2019s ready to take over for LeBron James as the best player in the Eastern Conference . But he\u2019s also poised for a true Kia MVP-caliber season now that new coach Mike Budenholzer is in place to smooth out the Bucks\u2019 rough edges. There\u2019s no better place to show off all the work he\u2019s done than against the other big man (Joel Embiid) who thinks he\u2019s going to assume the mantle in the East. And we\u2019ll know who is winning the battle at this late date in the regular season. Detroit Pistons vs. Toronto Raptors Nov. 14: 7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Watch it because \u2026  Coach Dwane Casey spent seven seasons transforming the Toronto Raptors into an Eastern Conference power. And in his final season coaching in Toronto, he earned Coach of the Year honors \u2026 only to be dumped after being swept out of the playoffs (again) by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Casey rebounded well with a Pistons team eager for a new voice and direction. Casey\u2019s new crew will no doubt have this date circled on the calendar. Sacramento Kings vs. Phoenix Suns Dec. 4: 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Watch it because \u2026  The matchup of the top two picks in the Draft always inspires some interesting subplots. For Deandre Ayton of the Suns and Marvin Bagley III of the Kings, that means every time you see each other people are going to compare and contrast where you are your respective career tracks. This first game (Bagley\u2019s first official trip back home as a pro) of four is only the beginning for these two young giants. The scrutiny will be there for years to come, fellas, so get used to it. Dallas Mavericks vs. Atlanta Hawks Oct. 24 (in Atlanta): 7 p.m. ET, ESPN Dec. 12 (in Dallas): 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Watch them because \u2026  You\u2019ll be linked together forever thanks to that Draft night trade . Time will tell who ends up being the better player. Neither rookie will be playing on a team expected to make much noise in term of the playoff chase. But they could be in the thick of the Rookie of the Year race, if things go as planned for both of them. Washington Wizards vs. Philadelphia 76ers Jan. 8, 2019: 7 ET, NBA League Pass Watch it because \u2026  John Wall says the Wizards are every bit as good as the other contenders in the Eastern Conference . Their track record the past few seasons says otherwise. The Celtics and Raptors have both made it to the conference finals and the Sixers are poised to get there in the near future with their talented, young group. Meanwhile, Wall, Bradley Beal and the Wizards have routinely come up short of that goal. Maybe the addition of Dwight Howard is the move that finally pushes them over the top \u2026 or not. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

How many games do you think they can win in 2018-19? * * * David Aldridge : Fewer, but that\u2019s not a big deal. The assumption here is they\u2019ll rest Chris Paul more and more going forward to give him the best chance at getting to the postseason, so that may cost them 4-6 meaningless regular season wins. And if you take away another handful because of the dual loss of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute , let\u2019s pencil Houston in for 55-57 regular season wins. Don\u2019t think that will be a big deal as long as they don\u2019t finish fourth in the west and have to face Golden State in the second round. Tas Melas :  The general sentiment among basketball fans is that the Rockets will be far worse ( the over-under line in Vegas is 55.5 wins! ). What actually happened with the roster to forecast such a drop-off? It\u2019s basically Carmelo Anthony and James Ennis replacing the departed Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute (leaving out the additions of RJ Hunter, Michael Carter-Williams, Markel Brown and draft picks at this point). Everyone will point to the defensive issues with Melo starting over Ariza. Defense is an attitude. Yes, a coach needs the personnel, but as much as it is about the guys on the floor, it\u2019s also about the locker room, and I still think there\u2019s enough with Clint Capela, Chris Paul and PJ Tucker (Ariza was part of mediocre Rockets defenses the two years before last season, which were also before James Harden improved defensively). And Melo replacing Ariza is why Ennis was signed \u2013 to be the defensive yang to Melo\u2019s offensive ying. Melo can play primarily in the 1st and 3rd with Ennis playing the most important defensive minutes in the 4th. Exposing Melo might happen more in the playoffs, but for the regular season, I see this as a 62-win team . They do still realize that they need the 1-seed to beat Golden State. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019d go with the under here and say 60 wins for the Rockets, not because they\u2019re in for a steep decline . I\u2019m just not sure they\u2019re willing to press for wins in April, given the unpredictability of Chris Paul\u2019s vulnerable body, which potentially cost them the Western Conference title (and maybe an NBA title) last season. The Rockets needed to get best record and home-court advantage in the West last season for their mental health. That\u2019s not necessarily the case now. * National TV schedule | Team-by-team schedules | More schedules John Schuhmann :  Even if the Rockets kept the same team together and were relatively healthy, another 65-win season would have been difficult in a deeper Western Conference. And the departure of Trevor Ariza and the loss of depth at the forward positions should hurt them, especially on defense, where they ranked sixth last season . They still have a terrific core of five guys \u2014 Harden, Paul, Capela, Eric Gordon and Tucker \u2014 and should be plenty motivated to get back to where they were a few months ago, so I\u2019ll guess that they finish with 59-61 wins , which would still be good for the second best season in franchise history . Sekou Smith :  I think the Rockets are capable of another 60-win season. But it\u2019ll take a monstrous effort to duplicate the season they had a year ago. And I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the energy. The Rockets need only maintain an advantage over the Golden State Warriors to ensure that a potential Game 7 in the Western Conference finals is played at the Toyota Center (only this time with a healthy Chris Paul). If the Warriors decide to attack the 2018-19 regular season the same way they did the 2017-18 regular season, the Rockets would be wise to push only hard enough to maintain a reasonable cushion ahead of the two-time defending champs. There\u2019s nothing else to prove. We know the Rockets are capable of winning it all. We witnessed it last season, right up until the moment that Paul suffered his injury . * * *"},{"id":38976,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-or-who-will-you-be-watching-during-first-4-6-weeks-season","date":"2018-08-10","title":"Blogtable: What (or who) will you be watching during early part of season?","content":" * * * What (or who) will you be watching intently during the first 4-6 weeks of the season? * * * David Aldridge : Like many, I\u2019ll be an amateur Kawhiologist all season , looking for any clues \u2014 all non-verbal, as we know Leonard won\u2019t be contributing his thoughts on the matter at any point \u2014 of his future intentions. Will he develop a sudden love of poutine? Start telling reporters, \u201ctake off, eh, you hoser?\u201d Any other lazy Canadian narratives I can think of? Seriously, the potential fit between Leonard and the Raptors could really change everything, starting with the Lakers\u2019 fever dreams of a second superstar to pair with LeBron. If Toronto convinces Leonard it\u2019s a place in which he can put down long-term stakes, the Eastern Conference changes dramatically. All of a sudden, the Boston Celtics\u2019 assumed rise to the top for the next several years would not be guaranteed. A Leonard-led Toronto franchise, with the young ballers the Raptors have in support, would be formidable. But if it becomes clear he\u2019s going to bounce, won\u2019t the Raps have to seriously think about moving him before the deadline? His first days\/weeks there will be crucial. Tas Melas :  Kawhi Leonard in Toronto. He was unanimously a top-five player when his playoffs ended on the foot of Zaza Pachulia in 2017 . What is he now? Will he smile ALL THE TIME just to troll us? I\u2019m very intrigued. Darkhorse: Speaking of great players, also very intrigued to see what Giannis Antetokounmpo does in coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s offense . Giannis needs some help and better synergy around him so he can win a playoff series already. Is a new coach, growth within, and Brook Lopez enough? Dark-Darkhorse:  There seems to be something happening very quietly in Indiana. Will Victor Oladipo take it to another level? Is Myles Turner gonna follow Oladipo\u2019s lead by both getting cut like him and producing a career season? Will Pacers fans be chanting: \u201cDoug-ie! Doug-ie!\u201d (McDermott). Shaun Powell :  A trick question, right? Well, of course it\u2019s the Lakers, not necessarily to see if LeBron James is still great, but to see if the team\u2019s transitional path is laced with banana peels. Remember, the first few months of the Big Three in Miami was rocky, and the Oklahoma City Thunder never really meshed last season. New faces often translate into awkward moments. There\u2019s no reason to suspect the young pups and LeBron and the wacky supporting cast of Rajon Rondo and Lance Stephenson won\u2019t eventually work out the kinks, but seeing them try to do so initially \u2014 and checking out the social media (over)reaction to that \u2014 will be fascinating. * National TV schedule | Team-by-team schedules | More schedules John Schuhmann :  The Lakers and Markelle Fultz. The Lakers, because of their youth and because playing with LeBron James is a big adjustment for a lot of players, should be a better team in February and March than they are in October and November. That doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t be fascinating to watch, especially on offense where it\u2019s not clear how the pieces fit together, from Day 1. On an individual basis, Fultz is the player to watch early in the season. If his shot is fixed, if his confidence is restored, and if he can play alongside Ben Simmons, the Sixers will have a better bench (to go along with what was the league\u2019s best high-volume lineup last season ), a more potent offense and a higher ceiling. Sekou Smith :  In addition to keeping an eagle eye on the Los Angeles Lakers from the first whistle of training camp until the final buzzer in their season finale (and that includes the first 4-6 weeks of the season), I am genuinely intrigued by the Boston Celtics. We all assume they\u2019ll insert Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward back into the mix and elevate above the rest of the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James is with the Lakers. I know that\u2019s the way things are supposed to go. But I want to see it. I want to see if Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown continue to thrive with those veterans back in the mix. I want to see how coach Brad Stevens handles the minutes for Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart now that they\u2019ve had a taste of the spotlight, a real taste. I need to see if their chemistry can survive the gathering storm of all that talent that\u2019s been assembled. We didn\u2019t get a chance to see it in action last season with Hayward going down five minutes into the season opener. It\u2019s a potentially fascinating group that could prove to be a true rival for the Golden State Warriors on the other side of the conference divide. * * *"},{"id":39006,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-which-team-do-you-predict-will-have-biggest-turnaround-2018-19","date":"2018-08-10","title":"Blogtable: Which team will have the biggest turnaround in 2018-19?","content":" * * * Which team do you predict will have the biggest turnaround in 2018-19? * * * David Aldridge :  Memphis. The Grizzlies had a great offseason ( as I detailed in my 1-30 summer rankings ) and they could easily double their 22 wins from last season. Mike Conley, Jr.\u2019s return is most important of course, but the infusion of both talent and toughness from both the Draft and free agency\/trades will revitalize the team just as much. The Grizz no longer will be held hostage by Chandler Parsons\u2019 status on a given night; they should be able to go eight deep with ease going forward whether or not he can contribute. Tas Melas :  The Grizzlies. They had a very solid under-the-radar offseason, adding Kyle Anderson, Garrett Temple, and Jaren Jackson Jr. But more importantly, they are getting back two of the best at their positions: Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. Yes, Gasol was there last season, but he was not himself with all the \u201cT-word\u201d that was going on. And Conley is one of the best guards in the game. The Grizz were 5-2 to start 2017-18 with Conley. Are you seriously bringing up the Grizzlies\u2019 record after seven games?! I gotta remind people of how good their core is after a 22-win season. Before whatever last year was, Memphis made the playoffs seven straight seasons. Shaun Powell :  The Memphis Grizzlies , by a hair over the Lakers. How can they not distance themselves from a 22-win season, especially with a healthy Mike Conley and a much better performance from Marc Gasol? And that doesn\u2019t mean the Grizzlies will make the playoffs, so let\u2019s keep it in the right context. But a leap of 15 or 17 wins sounds reasonable for a team that was a mess a year ago without Conley . * National TV schedule | Team-by-team schedules | More schedules John Schuhmann :  LeBron James\u2019 last two moves produced win increases of 11 games with Miami in 2010-11 and 20 games with Cleveland in 2014-15, but those teams (were in the East and) added additional All-Stars (Chris Bosh and Kevin Love) who fit better with James than any of the other players that the Lakers added this summer. Still, L.A. has a young core that should be improved and is the only team that looks 10 wins better than it was last season. Memphis, with a healthy Mike Conley and the addition of some vets that will defend, has a chance. Sekou Smith :  The Lakers. No one signals a shift in a team\u2019s fortunes the way LeBron James does. And adding him to the mix in Lakerland means the bottom line in L.A. is at least a double-digit improvement in the win column, if we\u2019re going by LeBron\u2019s track record when he relocates. The scrutiny on these Lakers should be epic, rivaling the traveling circus that was the Miami Heat in the first year of the \u201cHeatles\u201d (LeBron, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) era. Think about the mix of youngsters and veterans the Lakers have put together and tell me they wouldn\u2019t make up the cast of the best reality show of all time. The drama should be non-stop and as robust as we\u2019ve seen in any training camp in years. But if things hold true to the way LeBron has navigated both of his previous relocations, there\u2019s at least a 10-game improvement in the win column on the way as well. * * *"},{"id":39013,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-schedule-2018-19-revealed-official-release","date":"2018-08-10","title":"NBA unveils full 2018-19 season schedule","content":" NEW YORK \u2014  The NBA today released its  complete game schedule and broadcast schedules for ABC , TNT , ESPN , NBA TV and ESPN Radio for the 2018-19 regular season.

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry rallied with three birdies to shoot a 1-over 71 on Thursday in the first round of the Web.com Tour\u2019s Ellie Mae Classic. Making his second appearance in the $600,000 event at TPC Stonebrae, the Golden State Warriors star rebounded from a bogey on the second hole with a birdie on the par-5 third. He added birdies on the par-4 seventh and eighth \u2014 hitting the flagstick on No. 8 \u2014 and closed with a par on No. 9. Playing as an amateur, Curry was eight shots behind leaders Adam Long and Seth Reeves with the afternoon wave still on the course. Last year, Curry shot 74-74 to tie for 148th and miss the cut by 11 shots. Playing alongside Web.com Tour winners Martin Trainer and Cameron Champ in the round that began on No. 10, Curry slightly pulled his iron off the tee into the first cut of rough, up against a sprinkler head. \u201cI can\u2019t play this hole without getting a ruling,\u201d he joked, referencing the opening tee shot last year that wound up in a drink cup inside a cart left of the hole. He made par and also parred the next two before stumbling with bogeys on Nos. 13, 15 and 16. \u201cThis time, it took me until hole No. 8 or 9 to really just get comfortable, especially on the greens,\u201d Curry said. \u201cAgain, you can\u2019t simulate that pressure standing over 10-foot putts, 5-foot putts, knowing they count, and how many of them for me were for pars early. That was a hard part to adjust to, but once you get in a groove, good things happen.\u201d Curry made his fourth bogey at the par-3 second, then two-putted for birdie on the third. He celebrated with a lighthearted hug with caddie Jonnie West, a Warriors employee and TPC Stonebrae member. \u201cIt took me six holes last year to get my first one and it took me 12 holes this year,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI had to wait a little bit. It was a nice relief to see a putt go in.\u201d He made a 10-foot birdie putt on the seventh, then hit a 9-iron from 148 yards on the eighth that ricocheted off the pin and settled 5 feet short of the hole to set up a birdie. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s one of those off the face, hit it flush and it was on line,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI see it hit \u2014 or I hear the pin rattle \u2014 and that was a cool moment. I didn\u2019t know how close it landed. When I walked up there, literally was an inch away from dunking it. Out here I don\u2019t get many dunks.\u201d He three-putted for par on the par-5 ninth. \u201cIt was fun to be able to hit some decent shots early, and from there turn it into actual scoring, which was good,\u201d Curry said."},{"id":38973,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-tv-schedule-release-show-reveal-full-schedule-friday-official-release","date":"2018-08-09","title":"NBA TV to reveal full 2018-19 regular-season schedule on Friday at 4 p.m. ET","content":"NBA TV will unveil the full 2018-19 NBA regular season schedule, including highly-anticipated nationally-televised appearances throughout the entire season, during the NBA TV 2018-19 Schedule Release Show airing on NBA TV tomorrow, Friday, Aug. 10, at 4 p.m. *  NBA unveils key matchups for 2018-19 season  Casey Stern will host alongside analyst Dennis Scott.

According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ian Bagley and Fred Kerber of the New York Post , the Knicks will look to waive and stretch the remainder of Noah\u2019s contract if they cannot complete a trade for him or get him to agree to a buyout. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski and Begley on Noah\u2019s future with the team: In early February, the Knicks announced that they and Noah had reached a mutual agreement for Noah to take an indefinite leave of absence from the team . At that point, Noah had not been around the team since Jan. 25. Since missing that Jan. 25 game, Noah missed the Knicks\u2019 next four games as well. According to multiple reports at the time, Noah was away from the team because of a reported disagreement with then-Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek. Hornacek was fired at season\u2019s end and replaced by Fizdale . Noah signed with the Knicks in the summer of 2016 hoping that he could make an impact on New York\u2019s defense and front line. Since signing with New York, though, Noah has played in 53 games (starting 46 of them) and has lost time to various injuries. He had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last February and shoulder surgery last April . In March of 2017, he was suspended 20 games by the NBA for violating the league\u2019s anti-drug policy . That suspension cost him the first 12 games of the 2017-18 season. In 2016-17, Noah averaged five points and 8.8 rebounds per game in 26 minutes per game. Last season, he averaged 1.7 points, 2 rebounds and 5.7 minutes per game in seven games.

After much silence before and since then, Leonard has said his farewell to the only NBA city he had called home. In a letter submitted to the San Antonio Express-News , Leonard made a point to say thank you to the Spurs, his former teammates and coaches and the fans of the team. The former Finals MVP Leonard and his teammate, Danny Green, were traded by the Spurs to the Toronto Raptors for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round draft pick on July 18 . Leonard recently submitted his letter to the Express-News to express his gratefulness to the city and franchise he played for from 2011-18. Here\u2019s what Leonard wrote in his letter : In mid-June, Leonard made it known through the media that he wanted a trade from the Spurs. The team worked from that point forward to deal Leonard, who is a four-time All-Defensive team member and two-time winner of the Kia Defensive Player of the Year. Several teams \u2014 from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 showed interest in acquiring Leonard. But ultimately the Spurs sent the All-Star Leonard to the Raptors for fellow All-Star DeRozan, ending an off-the-court drama that rarely seems to befall the Spurs . Shortly after the Leonard trade took place, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich spoke with reporters and had nothing but positives to say about Leonard and the trade. \u201cWe wish him well as he moves into Toronto. I think he\u2019ll be great,\u201d Popovich said on July 18. \u201cI think this trade is going to work out great for both teams. We wish [Leonard] well, but at this point it\u2019s time to move on. It\u2019s time to move on. \u201cKawhi is not going to stop being a great player. But we\u2019re thrilled with DeMar. \u2026 To get back a proven NBA player and a proven All-Star, we have to be thrilled.\u201d Leonard appeared in just nine games last season, averaging 16.2 points 4.7 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. The strain between Leonard and San Antonio built throughout the 2017-18 campaign as the former 15th overall pick dealt with a lingering quadriceps injury. The unusual recovery time was compounded by his physical separation from the team, as Leonard continued his rehab in New York. His absence was especially notable during the Spurs\u2019 first-round playoff exit to the Golden State Warriors. The Spurs will open next season not only without Leonard, but as well without longtime guard Tony Parker (who signed with the Charlotte Hornets in free agency this summer ). Much like Leonard, Parker also published a letter to the Spurs and their fans this week \u2014 but his was done on The Players\u2019 Tribune web site . Parker\u2019s move \u2014 combined with Leonard\u2019s departure \u2014 signaled the end of an era in San Antonio, which has seen plenty of change since Tim Duncan\u2019s retirement in 2016 . Alongside Duncan and Manu Ginobili, Parker comprised the Spurs\u2019 \u201cBig Three\u201d for many years. But Duncan has retired, Parker is now gone and Ginobili\u2019s status for next season is unknown.
