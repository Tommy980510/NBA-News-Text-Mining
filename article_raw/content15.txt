[{"id":29151,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kobe-bryant-second-career-act-ends-too-soon","date":"2020-01-27","title":"Second career act for Kobe Bryant ends all too soon","content":" As the shock passed and the horror ebbed, the sad, natural reaction Sunday was to mourn for Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who perished among the nine passengers aboard a helicopter that crashed that morning in Calabasas, Calif. There was another layer to this gut-wrenching tragedy, though. Our hearts break not just for the person and player Bryant was, but for the man, the role model and the creative force he already had become and likely would have remained, maybe reinventing himself over the next three or four decades. Bryant, at 41 and just three years removed from his dazzling, 20-year NBA career , was nailing one of the most difficult tasks an elite athlete ever faces: crafting a second act worthy of his fame, his interests, his time and his drive. For everything Bryant accomplished as a slam-dunk, first-ballot Hall of Famer \u2014 he figured to be enshrined in Springfield, Mass., next September alongside certain 2020 classmates Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett \u2014 he was going to be fascinating to watch all over again for what he was building now. Already, there was Granity Studios , the multimedia company from which the ESPN+ series \u201cDetail\u201d sprung, analyzing pro athletes\u2019 performances. It\u2019s the home, too, of a podcast Bryant originated, \u201cThe Punies,\u201d to impart life lessons to children and their families through songs and sports. There was his short animated film \u201cDear Basketball,\u201d inspired by a poem Bryant wrote to announce his retirement from the NBA. It blew up in the entertainment industry, earning Annie and Sports Emmy awards, along with a 2018 Oscar . https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v \u201cThey\u2019re at the top for me,\u201d Bryant said in an interview with USA Today for a story that was posted mere days before his death. \u201cAs a kid, you kind of have the goal of winning championships and all these sorts of [sports] things. Being in the industry I\u2019m in now? It wasn\u2019t something that was thought of, me winning an Oscar.\u201d Bryant\u2019s company has shepherded the publishing of three children\u2019s sports-fantasy books , with a fourth due this spring. Per USA Today , Bryant\u2019s interest in storytelling was sparked and fanned by a creative writing course he took in high school, along with an innate curiosity about successful people he developed while growing up as the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. Though he did not read much during his childhood, Bryant became an avid fan of Harry Potter, Star Wars and Disney movies. He read biographies to learn what made accomplished people tick. He watched movies to study character development and story arc. While nursing three consecutive season-ending injuries before his final year, Bryant brainstormed project ideas. That led to Bryant overseeing \u201cMuse,\u201d a Showtime documentary that detailed his successes and failures during his career. \u201cYou got to do what you love to do,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI love telling stories. I love inspiring kids or providing them with tools that are going to help them.\u201d Bryant\u2019s post-NBA life included sports-related ventures, notably the Mamba Sports Academy facilities in Thousand Oaks and Redondo Beach for current and aspiring athletes. He was in his second season coaching Gianna\u2019s AAU basketball team, also known as \u201cThe Mambas\u201d from Bryant\u2019s \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d nickname. They reportedly were headed to one of the games at the time of the crash Sunday. Bryant from all appearances showed aptitude, passion and work ethic for all those pursuits, sweating details and logging long hours even as he stayed involved with wife Vanessa in their four daughters\u2019 upbringing.  His sudden death, of course, would have been a blow to the NBA family and casual sports fans around the world even if he had opened a single car wash in Burbank as some unneeded, blue-vest diversion in retirement. Sliding into a broadcast studio or plopping down on the Lakers bench as an assistant coach would have been fine, too, well-earned and obvious outlets for his know-how and competitiveness. But in choosing the challenges he did, in following his curiosity, Bryant embarked on a thoroughly personal path. Which, ironically, answered some of the primary criticism he heard while winning five NBA titles, two Finals MVPs and the NBA MVP in 2008 . All those years he was chasing and nearly matching Michael Jordan, ultimately positioning himself as the second-best shooting guard in history, Bryant became something of a doppelganger, a spirit double for the Chicago Bulls\u2019 legend. From his game to his gait, in intensity and even in phrasing, the younger man (15 years Jordan\u2019s junior) fashioned himself almost into a carbon copy. That made it harder for Bryant ever to eclipse Jordan, who had touched all the same bases \u2014 along with a few more.  This version of Kobe Bryant we had seen the past three years, though, the one we lost Sunday, was entirely original. So, we mourn for who he was, for what he did and a little extra for what he was going to do and become. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Young correctly noted recently that it\u2019s too early to make such comparisons. But that won\u2019t stop anybody from doing so. Expect the conversation regarding these two All-Star starters to intensify on Saturday ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ), when the teams meet in Dallas for the first matchup this season between the Hawks and the Mavericks. * * * \u2022 Update: Doncic (ankle) won\u2019t play Saturday, Feb. 1 (8:30 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 12, 2018 Forever linked due to them being traded for one another in 2018, Young and Doncic face off for just the third time of their careers, and the first time since their rookie seasons. The last time Young and Doncic matched up, both produced 24-point double-doubles. Doncic\u2019s involved points and rebounds, while Young generated his double-double off points and assists. As Young recently noted, this hasn\u2019t really been a fair fight because the teams are trending in opposite directions. Doncic has the better supporting cast on a squad pushing for a postseason berth, while Young is working to lead a young, struggling team that might be quite a bit away from legitimate playoff contention.

Dating back to Jan. 23, 2019, Gobert has won each of the last three battles against Jokic. Last season, in the four times these two clashed head-to-head, Jokic scored a total of 25 points with eight assists and seven turnovers while shooting 9-for-30. Over that same timeframe, Gobert scored 15 points in the four matchups against Jokic, shooting 5-for-14 with two turnovers.

But these two were connected way before they became the top two picks of the 2019 Draft. Morant and Williamson grew up in South Carolina nearly 90 minutes apart and played for the same AAU team for a season. Williamson didn\u2019t even make his NBA debut until last Wednesday, and he scored 17 consecutive points in the fourth quarter of a loss to San Antonio while Morant cheered on his fellow rookie. Morant leads all rookies in scoring, assists and double-doubles, and is currently the favorite to win Kia Rookie of the Year, doing so while leading an exciting, young Memphis squad that has serious playoff hopes. \u2022 Wednesday, Jan. 29 (10 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Jan. 15, 2020  Anthony has been pretty productive in revenge games this season. He hit the New York Knicks for 26 points in his return to Madison Square Garden, dropped 19 in his first game against the Thunder and shot 7-for-10 for 18 points and 12 rebounds earlier this month in a 117-107 Portland win during his return to Houston. Most of the damage inflicted by Anthony on that night came against former teammate Tucker. Anthony was 3-for-3 and scored nine points when Tucker guarded him.

But it was Rose that sent the game into the extra period by going the length of the floor to hit a bucket with 1.9 seconds remaining in regulation. Irving has claimed victory in the last two games in this series. Matched up for 1:38 against Rose, Irving hit his lone shot attempt. Rose scored 4 points matched up against Irving in addition to dishing two dimes. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The Italian basketball federation said Monday it has ordered a minute\u2019s silence to be observed for all games \u201cin every category for the entire week.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a small but heartfelt and deserved gesture to honor the life and memory of Kobe Bryant, an absolute champion who always had Italy in his heart,\u201d the federation said. \u201cKobe was and will always be linked to our country.\u201d Bryant lived in Italy between the ages of 6 and 13 while his father, Joe Bryant, played for several teams in the country. He returned to Pennsylvania for high school. Kobe Bryant spoke fluent Italian and often said it would be a \u201cdream\u201d to play in the country. That dream almost came true when Bryant nearly joined Virtus Bologna in 2011 during an NBA lockout, only for the deal to fall apart. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a friend,\u201d read a front-page headline in the Gazzetta dello Sport, Italy\u2019s leading sports newspaper. Bryant, an 18-time NBA All-Star who won five championships and became one of the greatest basketball players of his generation during a 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, died Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a helicopter crash near Calabasas, California . He was 41. \u201cAll of the NBA players are important, because they\u2019re legends, but he\u2019s particularly important to us because he knew Italy so well, having lived in several cities here,\u201d Italian federation president Giovanni Petrucci told The Associated Press late Sunday night. \u201cHe had a lot of Italian qualities,\u201d Petrucci added. \u201cHe spoke Italian very well. He even knew the local slang.\u201d Pistoia, one of the teams that Joe Bryant played for, tweeted a message with a picture of Kobe Bryant during a recent trip to the Tuscan town. \u201cWe saw him play at the PalaCarrara during halftime of his father Joe\u2019s games,\u201d Pistoia said. \u201cHe had a strong bond with the city of Pistoia and it was just a few years ago that he came to pay us a visit. May the earth rest lightly on you #Kobe.\u201d Italian coach Ettore Messina worked with Bryant as an assistant for the Lakers. \u201cHe was a supernatural,\u201d Messina told the AP late Sunday while traveling with his current club, Olimpia Milano. \u201cTo hear him speak and joke in our language and to remember when his father played here and he was a kid drew a lot of people to the NBA,\u201d Messina said. \u201cHe was also always very attentive to help Italian kids arriving in the NBA and to help them enter such a tough and competitive world. He also did that with me when I arrived at the Lakers and I\u2019m still very grateful to him for that. It\u2019s very sad that his family has been devastated like this.\u201d"},{"id":29155,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kobe-bryant-dies-helicopter-crash","date":"2020-01-27","title":"Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant dies at 41 in helicopter crash","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kobe Bryant inspired a generation of basketball players worldwide with sublime skills and an unquenchable competitive fire. He earned Los Angeles\u2019 eternal adoration during his two decades as the fierce soul of the beloved Lakers, and he was respected by basketball fans from every place with a hoop and a dream, including his native Philadelphia and in Italy, his other childhood home. Less than four years into his retirement, Bryant was seizing new challenges and working to inspire his daughters\u2019 generation through sports and storytelling when his next chapter ended shockingly early. Bryant, the 18-time All-Star who won five NBA championships and became one of the greatest basketball players of his generation during a 20-year career all with the Lakers, died in a helicopter crash Sunday. He was 41. The crash occurred in the foggy hills above Calabasas, California, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Bryant was killed, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press, and a different person familiar with the case confirmed Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter Gianna also died. Both of the AP \u2018s unnamed sources spoke on condition of anonymity because few details of the crash had been released publicly. Authorities said nine people were on the helicopter, and all were presumed dead. No names were released. Bryant lived south of Los Angeles in coastal Orange County, and he often used helicopters to save time and avoid Southern California\u2019s notorious traffic. He traveled to practices and games by helicopter before his playing career ended in 2016. He continued to use them after retirement as he attended to his new ventures, which included a burgeoning entertainment company that recently produced an Academy Award-winning animated short film. The basketball world and Los Angeles reacted with an outpouring of pain and disbelief. Bryant is all but certain to be elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame this year, when he is eligible for the first time. \u201cFor 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cHe was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary \u2026 but he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability.\u201d The crash occurred about 20 miles from Mamba Sports Academy, Bryant\u2019s basketball training complex in Newbury Park, California. A youth basketball tournament \u2014 the Mamba Cup \u2014 was scheduled for a second day of competition Sunday at the facility, and Bryant had attended the opening day Saturday with Gianna. Bryant and his wife, Vanessa, had four daughters. He had been a vocal booster of women\u2019s sports since his retirement, coaching and mentoring basketball players around the world while also backing women\u2019s soccer and other endeavors. Bryant retired as the third-leading scorer in NBA history with 33,643 points, all scored in Lakers purple and gold. The self-nicknamed Black Mamba was a prolific, gifted shooter with a sublime all-around game and a relentless, hard-edged work ethic that thrilled his fans and almost everyone else, even those who reviled him. Taking cues from Michael Jordan, one of his idols, Bryant played with a swagger that compelled him to talk trash, to guard the toughest opponents, to play through pain and to demand the ball at the biggest moments of games. He didn\u2019t always hit them, but Bryant never stopped trying. \u201cHe had zero flaws offensively,\u201d LeBron James said Saturday night. \u201cZero. You backed off of him, he could shoot the 3. You body him up a little bit, he could go around you. He could shoot from mid-range. He could post. He could make free throws. \u2026 He was just immortal offensively because of his skill set and his work ethic.\u201d Bryant held the No. 3 spot in the league scoring ranks until the day before his death, when James passed him during the Lakers\u2019 game in Philadelphia. On Saturday night, James said he was \u201chappy just to be in any conversation with Kobe Bean Bryant, one of the all-time greatest basketball players to ever play. One of the all-time greatest Lakers.\u201d Bryant always reacted graciously to the achievements of James, his former on-court rival who joined the Lakers in 2018. \u201cContinuing to move the game forward @KingJames,\u201d Bryant wrote in his last tweet. \u201cMuch respect my brother.\u201d Tim Duncan, the San Antonio Spurs great who also retired in 2016, is also expected to be part of the Hall of Fame class that will be announced at the NBA\u2019s All-Star weekend next month. Duncan, now a Spurs assistant, was visibly emotional on the bench during their game against Toronto on Sunday. Bryant had been spending more time with his daughters since leaving the league. The Bryants\u2019 first daughter, Natalia, turned 17 a week ago. Bianka Bella Bryant is 3 years old, and Capri Kobe Bryant was born last June. Gianna, better known as Gigi, had a promising youth career and a competitive pugnaciousness that reminded everybody of her dad. Bryant sat with her courtside at a Brooklyn Nets game late last year, clearly passing along his wisdom to his daughter. Bryant told Jimmy Kimmel in 2018 that Gianna wanted to play in the WNBA and recalled how fans would often approach him saying \u201cyou gotta have a boy, you gotta someone to carry on the tradition, the legacy.\u201d Gianna took exception: \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Oy, I got this,\u201d\u2018 Bryant recalled. News of Bryant\u2019s death inspired an outpouring of grief around the sports world and beyond, but it was felt particularly painfully in Los Angeles, where Bryant was unquestionably the sprawling city\u2019s most popular athlete and one of its most beloved people. Buildings from downtown to Los Angeles International Airport were illuminated in Lakers purple and gold. The Lakers\u2019 next game is Tuesday night against the crosstown rival Clippers, but hundreds of fans \u2014 many in Bryant jerseys and Lakers gear \u2014 spontaneously gathered at Staples Center and in the surrounding LA Live entertainment complex on Sunday, weeping and staring at video boards with Bryant\u2019s image before the Grammy awards ceremony. \u201cI thought he was going to live forever,\u201d Lakers great Magic Johnson told KCBS-TV. \u201cI thought he was invincible. \u2026 There was nobody who took more pride in putting on that Laker uniform than Kobe. Nobody. He was just special. We will miss him and we\u2019ll remember him for his greatness, but let\u2019s not forget how he impacted the world, too.\u201d Bryant retired as the Lakers\u2019 franchise leader in points, games played, 3-pointers and steals \u2014 no small feats on a franchise that has employed many of the greatest players in basketball history. The NBA kept its games on as scheduled when the news broke. The Spurs and Raptors both took voluntary 24-second shot clock violations at the start of their game in honor of Bryant, who wore No. 24 for the second half of his career. Several other teams followed up by deliberately taking delays of 24 and 8 seconds, honoring both of his jersey numbers. Many players were seen crying before their games, and James looked emotional on the tarmac when he got off the Lakers\u2019 team plane from Philadelphia. Bryant\u2019s future appeared to be limitless in retirement, whether in sports or entertainment. He opened a production company shortly after leaving the Lakers, saying he was just as passionate about storytelling as he had been about his sport. He won an Oscar in 2018 for his contributions to \u201cDear Basketball, \u201d an animated short about his relationship to the game. He also produced content for ESPN. In 2003, Bryant was charged with attacking a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. He had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the women declined to testify in a trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. Bryant went on to become one of the NBA\u2019s most popular players and the face of the Lakers. Winning a record four NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, he was the overall league MVP in 2008 and a two-time NBA scoring champion, but he also earned 12 selections to the NBA\u2019s All-Defensive teams. He teamed with Shaquille O\u2019Neal in a combustible partnership to lead the Lakers to NBA titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002. He later teamed with Pau Gasol to win two more titles in 2009 and 2010. A two-time Olympic gold medalist with the dominant U.S. team, Bryant retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final NBA game. In December 2017, the Lakers hung banners retiring his No. 8 and No. 24 jerseys in the Staples Center rafters in an unprecedented double honor. Bryant looms large over the current generation of NBA players, most of whom grew up either idolizing Bryant or absorbing his work ethic and competitive spirit in the same way Bryant\u2019s generation learned from Jordan. Bryant exemplified and passed on that mentality to James, Stephen Curry and the NBA\u2019s current wave of high-scoring superstars. After James passed Bryant on Saturday, he remembered listening in awe to Bryant when the superstar came to speak at a childhood basketball camp. \u201cI remember one thing he said: If you want to be great at it, or want to be one of the greats, you\u2019ve got to put the work in,\u201d said James, who later teamed up with Bryant on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team in Beijing. Bryant was a basketball superstar for his entire adult life, and he grew up from a teenager to a respected veteran in the unforgiving Hollywood spotlight. He entered the NBA draft straight out of suburban Philly\u2019s Lower Merion High School in 1996 after a childhood spent partly in Italy, where his father, former NBA player Joe \u201cJellybean\u201d Bryant, played professionally. Bryant was occasionally estranged from his now-65-year-old father, but reconciled. Bryant spoke four languages and played a major role in the NBA\u2019s international growth over his two decades in the league, traveling the world and connecting with athletes in other sports and celebrities. The Lakers acquired the 17-year-old Bryant in a trade shortly after Charlotte drafted him, and he immediately became one of the most exciting and intriguing players in the sport alongside O\u2019Neal, who had signed with the Lakers as a free agent. Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest as a rookie, and the Lakers gradually grew into a team that won three consecutive championships. Bryant and Gasol, the Spanish star, formed the nucleus of another championship team in 2008, reaching three straight NBA Finals and winning two more titles. Between those title runs and before the quiet final years of his career, Bryant accomplished innumerable feats including an 81-point game against Toronto in January 2006. Bryant\u2019s final NBA seasons were dogged by injuries, but he still went into retirement with that jaw-dropping 60-point performance against Utah."},{"id":29149,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/city-struggles-process-death-icon","date":"2020-01-27","title":"City struggles to process death of an icon","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 Kobe Bryant, who influenced and inspired a generation of fans and players by winning five NBA championships with the Lakers and performing with excellence and flair, died shockingly in a helicopter crash Sunday just miles from downtown Los Angeles. He was 41. The morning accident in heavy fog in the hills near Calabasas also claimed the lives of his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others aboard the S-76 helicopter. The nine-member group was en route to a girls basketball game in nearby Thousand Oaks. As a player and also in retirement, Bryant was fond of flying by helicopter from his home in Newport Beach to escape traffic; his daughter played on a travel team with her father\u2019s constant presence and support. The news was a stunning jolt to the NBA, the Lakers organization and Southern California, all saddened by his death, mournful for his family and finding it difficult to process the passing of a basketball icon who seemed indestructible. Bryant spent his entire 20-year NBA career with the Lakers, who retired his jersey numbers 8 and 24, and was just 17 when drafted in 1996. In addition to the championships, he was an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA team, won an MVP award and two Olympic gold medals. His aggressive play and competitive spirit \u2014 which he described as \u201cMamba Mentality,\u201d evoked from his nickname \u2014 endeared him to basketball fans worldwide and especially those in Los Angeles who worshiped him long after he played his final game in 2016. Within hours after hearing the news, thousands of fans gathered for a mass grief session across from Staples Center, many wearing Bryant\u2019s jerseys and chanting \u201cKo-be, Ko-Be\u201d and \u201cM-V-P.\u201d The death of Bryant qualified as a where-were-you moment for many. Reaction was heavy and heartfelt not only within the basketball community and other sports, but among politicians, entertainers and educators, proof of Bryant\u2019s widespread appeal and reach around the world. In a statement, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said, in part: \u201cFor 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning. He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary \u2026 but he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability. He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna.\u201d Michael Jordan, who passed the ceremonial torch to Bryant at the 1998 All-Star Game, said via statement: \u201cWords cannot describe the pain I am feeling. I loved Kobe \u2014 he was like a little brother to me. We used to talk often, and I will miss those conversations very much.\u201d His co-star for three championships, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, wrote on social media: \u201cThere are no words to express the pain I\u2019m going through with this tragedy of losing my niece Gigi and my brother \u2026 I love u and u will be missed.\u201d Bryant came to the NBA straight from high school and was a pioneer in that sense. He was the son of Joe Bryant, formerly of the 76ers. After his NBA career, Joe Bryant later played professionally in Italy where Kobe spent much of his youth. Upon returning to the States, Kobe was fluent in multiple languages and anxious to follow his father\u2019s footsteps, which didn\u2019t take long. His reputation took root and soared at Lower Merion High School in the Philadelphia suburbs and in summer pickup games with NBA players, so much that Lakers GM Jerry West executed a draft-day trade to bring Bryant to L.A. to team with the newly acquired O\u2019Neal. The ticket line wrapped around the block for Bryant\u2019s first NBA Summer League game mainly on the strong hunch, later proven true, that Bryant was about to become a special player. He scored 25 points in that game to standing room only. Suddenly the Lakers, after a brief down period on the heels of \u201cShowtime,\u201d were back in the winner\u2019s circle and re-elevated among the elite franchises in professional sports. Bryant instantly captured the imagination of a new generation and, once his string of All-Star appearances began, became one of the faces of the league in the post-Jordan era. He was the rare player who excelled both in the air and on the ground, and at both ends of the floor. Not only did Bryant prove to be a big draw in L.A., he sold out arenas in other cities, with many fans shifting their allegiances from the home team whenever the Lakers visited. And his multilingual ability enabled him to relate internationally and make him an ambassador in the NBA\u2019s efforts to grow the game worldwide. In his book \u201cEleven Rings,\u201d Phil Jackson, Bryant\u2019s former coach, wrote: \u201cKobe was hell-bent on surpassing Jordan as the greatest player in the game. His obsession with Michael was striking. When we played in Chicago that season (1999-2000), I orchestrated a meeting between the two stars, thinking that Michael might help shift Kobe\u2019s attitude toward selfless teamwork. After they shook hands, the first words out of Kobe\u2019s mouth were, \u2018You know I can kick your ass one on one.\u2019 \u201d Bryant played the game with a mixture of unleashed joy and unabashed intensity. He did not apologize for his relentless aggression. He practiced with the same fervor and seemed single-minded in his thirst to win championships and become one of the all-time greats. He had his quirks, which gave something in common with other successful people in all walks. Still: Bryant often said he had an obligation to the game, the fans, his teammates and coaches, along with himself. His basketball eruptions were numerous and many were legendary. In 2006, he dropped 81 points on the Toronto Raptors, second only to Wilt Chamberlain for most points in a game. Three years later at Madison Square Garden, one of his favorite places to play, he set a record for the storied arena with 61 points . And in his final game, Bryant scored 60 points in a made-for-Hollywood ending. Those performances and others were born of rare and early failure. In his rookie season, Bryant struggled in the playoffs, shooting four airballs as the Lakers were eliminated by Utah. Bryant vowed he would never come up short in a big spot again. Kobe said, years later: \u201cI look back at it now with fond memories. Back then it was misery. It helped shape me.\u201d He threw the alley-oop pass to Shaq in Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference finals that sealed the win for the Lakers. He scored the winning basket in Game 4 of the ensuing Finals after Shaq fouled out, and the Lakers went on to win their first title since 1988. He and Shaq, both alpha stars with strong egos, had a complicated relationship, which fractured in 2004 and Shaq was traded to Miami. Bryant went through a mid-career crisis then, setting scoring records and qualifying as a one-man act. He scored 65 points, 50 points, 60 points, 50 points, 43 points, 23 points and then 53 points in one seven-game stretch in March of 2007 but couldn\u2019t lead the talent-starved Lakers beyond the first round. Frustrated, he asked for a trade but didn\u2019t press the issue as the Lakers wisely denied him. Two more championships would soon follow after the arrival of fellow All-Star Pau Gasol. Bryant and O\u2019Neal would later mend fences and became close, along with their families. Bryant even trained Shareef O\u2019Neal, one of Shaq\u2019s sons. From almost every metric, Bryant qualifies as one of the greatest in NBA history. He was a two-time scoring champion, retiring as the No. 3 scorer in history and the youngest to 30,000 points. Just hours before his death he was passed on that list by current Laker LeBron James. (Bryant\u2019s final Twitter post, late Saturday, was a congratulatory message to James.) Bryant was hardly one-dimensional; he was a nine-time First Team member of the All-Defensive team. And as proof of his ability to entertain, Bryant won a dunk contest and four All-Star MVPs to add to his bucket of accomplishments. His love for basketball didn\u2019t end with retirement. Bryant won a 2018 Academy Award for Best Animated Film for \u201cDear Basketball.\u201d He also tutored many aspiring and current players during the summer. Finally, inspired by his daughter Gianna\u2019s desire to play, he became a strong advocate for women\u2019s sports, often appearing at WNBA games and voicing support for equal rights and pay. He recently mused that a woman could one day play in the NBA. Last year, he created Mamba Sports Academy as a site to stage fitness and training sessions along with youth sports and organized travel games, and that was where Bryant, his daughter and other passengers were headed when the helicopter crashed. He leaves behind his wife Vanessa and three other daughters, one born just last June. The NBA is very much a family and a tribe, and after being stricken by the news, tributes poured in from all over the league. There were moments of silence recognized for NBA games played Sunday. Hawks guard Trae Young, who was cited as one of Gianna Bryant\u2019s favorite players, wore a No. 8 jersey during pregame warmups. After the opening tip of the Spurs vs. Raptors game, both teams let the 24-second shot clock expire on their first possession as a tribute to the number last worn by Bryant. The Lakers did not have a scheduled game Sunday, but there will no doubt be tributes for Tuesday\u2019s game at Staples Center against the Clippers. Bryant did not lead a perfect life, but by and large it was blessed. He was a devoted father to his girls and appeared overjoyed to spend more time with them in retirement. He had amassed a fortune well into the hundreds of millions. He began business ventures and shot a hungry eye toward Hollywood and media endeavors. His life ended shockingly and astonishingly young, and his family will be forever fractured by the loss of him and his daughter. As for the basketball Kobe Bryant, he once described that life was far deeper than what appeared on a nightly basis in arenas for 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s the struggles to get there that completes the journey,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIf you just have championships, there\u2019s no antagonist. There\u2019s no up and down. It\u2019s the ugly moments that create the beauty. Those are the moments I truly appreciate.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Statistics help break down Kobe vs. LeBron debate","content":" Despite being inextricably linked as superstar contemporaries whose career overlapped for 13 seasons, there was never much of a rivalry between Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Not on the court, at least, where the two never locked horns so much as a single time in the playoffs, where rivalries are truly born. Off the court, however, is a different story altogether as fans have been debating their respective places in the game for years. Kobe has more rings and a killer instinct LeBron lacks, argues one side. But LeBron, counters the other, is just better. Now comes even more fuel to the fire as James, now wearing the same purple-and-gold uniform Bryant donned for two decades, surpassed the Laker legend for third place on the career scoring list in a loss to the Sixers in Philadelphia. It marks the latest achievement in a career already filled with them for James, surpassing yet another great with seemingly no end in sight. Nearly 34,000 points \u2014 one bucket at a time, one game at a time, one season at a time, since 2003. But does that mean James was the better scorer? Raw stats would seem to say so, with James averaging more points per game on superior efficiency. But let\u2019s take a deeper look in some other areas that might shed more light on how two of the very best scorers to ever grace an NBA court truly measure up. Cumulative statistics are better measures of production and longevity than actual impact. But as far as that goes, Bryant\u2019s career point total would almost certainly be larger, perhaps even significantly so, had he entered the league with a different team, at a different time. When the Lakers traded for Bryant in the summer of 1996, he was the first high school guard to join the NBA, and only the fifth high school player overall. As such, the NBA was still grappling with how to best develop them. Bring them along slowly? Throw them right into the deep end? At that point, it was still anyone\u2019s guess. That was especially the case with the Lakers, who were expected to contend for the championship after adding Shaquille O\u2019Neal to a veteran roster that included, among other standouts, a future All-Star at Bryant\u2019s position in Eddie Jones. The following two seasons would prove to be an exercise in frustration for the precocious young star as he waited impatiently for his opportunity to shine. It wouldn\u2019t be until his third season that Bryant finally cracked the starting lineup, averaging 37.9 minutes, 15.6 shots and 19.9 points in 1998-99 as a 20-year-old. James, of course, never had that issue. By the time Cleveland took him 1st overall in 2003, the NBA was 16 additional players and almost a full decade deeper into the straight-from-high-school experiment. Combined with his otherworldly talent, there was never any doubt: The Cavaliers were LeBron\u2019s team from Day 1, ready to go as their prize rookie went. Would Bryant have been able to average 20.9 points as a rookie, or 27.2 points in his second season, as James did? We\u2019ll never know. But we do know he didn\u2019t get the chance to try. Unfortunately, Basketball Reference\u2019s shot tracking only dates back to 2000-01, which excludes four seasons from Bryant\u2019s career totals. But given that what they do have accounts for more than 87% of his total attempts, it still gives us a fairly comprehensive look at his shot distribution. And that look is telling: He simply wasn\u2019t capable of and\/or willing to work for the same kind of shots as James. Two things stand out the most. * First, and this will come as no surprise for anyone who saw Bryant play for any significant period, the strong majority of his shots \u2014 28%, almost seven points more than any other zone \u2014 came from what we\u2019ll call far mid range (defined by B-R as 16 feet to the 3-point line). This is where Bryant excelled at isolating defenders and, if he couldn\u2019t break them down off the dribble, digging deep into his bag of tricks for some kind of jump shot, degree of difficulty be damned. These are also some of the least-efficient shots in basketball according to the recent philosophical revolution that emphasizes 3-pointers and looks at the rim to the exclusion of virtually everything else. * Second, James simply takes better shots, and a lot more of them. As a high-volume scorer, he is obviously no stranger to taking contested 2-point jumpers. But it was never a staple of his diet. Indeed, why would it be when he could usually either overpower smaller opponents or speed past bigger ones to get to the rim? Standing several inches and at least 40 pounds heavier than Bryant, James has been able to take a whopping 36% of his career attempts at the rim, compared to a relatively paltry 21% for Bryant. Not only that, James is significantly more effective on those shots, shooting 73.3% \u2014 the league average this season is 66.0 \u2014 compared to 63.4 for Bryant. Given that Bryant didn\u2019t make up that ground at the 3-point line \u2014 James actually shoots slightly better on 0.2 more attempts per game \u2014 LeBron\u2019s advantage at the rim is even more enormous. What makes James\u2019 scoring feats even more impressive is that it\u2019s never really been the focal point of his game. That might sound like a silly thing to say given that LeBron has averaged virtually the same number of shot attempts (19.6 to 19.5) and free throws (8.0 to 7.4) as Bryant, whose credentials as an aggressive volume scorer are unquestioned. But James has done that while serving as arguably the best non-point guard playmaker in NBA history. Indeed, going by raw stats, there\u2019s no \u201carguably\u201d about it: James has both the highest per-game assist average (7.4, 24th) and assist percentage (36.3, 20th overall) among those who didn\u2019t play the \u201c1.\u201d That places him in a completely different category as Bryant. Which isn\u2019t to say that Kobe was deficient in that capacity; far from it. As far as volume scorers go, Bryant was frequently a very willing and able passer, forming devastating tandems with O\u2019Neal (at least when they weren\u2019t trying to kill each other) and later Pau Gasol en route to a total of five championships. It\u2019s just that far more often than not, Bryant\u2019s clear m.o. was to shoot first, and ask questions later. James, on the other hand, has spent far, far more possessions creating for others where he might have otherwise looked to get his. That\u2019s been especially the case this season as he leads the NBA in raw assists per game (10.8, almost double Bryant\u2019s career-high of 6.0), potential assists per game (19.0) and points created via assist (27.1).  If you ever want to aggravate a serious basketball analyst \u2014 which, to be clear, we don\u2019t claim to be \u2014 bring up the term \u201cclutch.\u201d They\u2019ll argue to the death that there\u2019s no such thing, that the ability to consistently raise one\u2019s performance in important, end-of-game moments is largely a myth conjured around random outcomes over incredibly small sample sizes. Just how small? In 1,566 career games, including the postseason, Bryant was called on to shoot for the lead in the final five seconds of regulation or overtime just 77 times \u2014 4.9 percent. For James, it\u2019s 73 out of 1,480 \u2014 also 4.9 percent. In other words, these are extremely isolated opportunities that, given the fact that everybody in the arena knows who\u2019s getting the ball, don\u2019t exactly lend themselves to consistent success. Indeed, just look at these percentages on such shots: Bryant enjoys the edge in the regular season, while LeBron has more playoff game-winners. Otherwise, ouch. If we insist on debating the notion of \u201cclutch\u201d or \u201ckiller instinct,\u201d perhaps it might be more informative to expand our scope. For example, wouldn\u2019t it be more interesting to examine how players performed, say, in elimination playoff games? That still doesn\u2019t afford much in the way of sample size, but it\u2019s infinitely larger than last-second shots. And in that arena, James has no peers \u2014 literally. From his 45-point, 15-rebound masterpiece against the Celtics in 2012 to his string of epic performances to lift the Cavaliers back from a 3-1 deficit in the 2016 Finals, James has put up the best statistical record in elimination games of any player in NBA history. Better than Jordan. Better than Kareem. And yes, significantly better than Bryant. These are monster numbers, including the highest scoring average in league history , coming in some of the most important games a player will ever face. And yet Bryant, despite having significantly worse averages across the board, and no clear edge in game-winners, is the one with the killer closer reputation, while LeBron\u2019s narrative is that of a player who hasn\u2019t always risen to the occasion. Which isn\u2019t untrue on its face. This is also a player who vanished under baffling circumstances as the 2011 Finals slipped through Miami\u2019s collective fingers. But the overall body of work speaks for itself: When your season is on the line and \u201cclutch\u201d is required, LeBron is truly The King. * * * Dan McCarney wrote this feature.

I remember one thing he said was that if you want to try and be great at it, and want to be one of the greats, you\u2019ve got to put the work in.\u201d James put in the work and followed Bryant\u2019s path \u2014 from making the leap from high school straight to the NBA, to winning NBA titles, and, eventually, to playing in Los Angeles. With a driving right-handed layup, James no longer chased Bryant, he zoomed past him for third place on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list . \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be in any conversation with Kobe Bryant, one of the all-time greats to ever play,\u201d James said. Bryant congratulated James via Twitter not long after his historic basket. With a tribute to Bryant written on his Nikes, James scored 29 points in front of a roaring 76ers\u2019 crowd, but the Lakers fell short in a 108-91 loss to Philadelphia on Saturday night. James scribbled \u201cMamba 4 Life\u201d as he chased Bryant, the five-time champion, in Philly. Fans stood with phones pointed toward the court, waiting to capture a slice of history that came when James scored the milestone basket with 7:23 left in the third quarter. James entered 18 points shy of passing Bryant, and the layup gave him 33,644 points. James stands third with 33,655. Bryant finished his career with 33,643, all with the Lakers. James waved to the Philadelphia crowd that gave him a rousing standing ovation when the mark was announced by the public address announcer. The Sixers also posted a graphic of the NBA\u2019s top 10 career scorers with images of James in Lakers and Miami Heat jerseys. The 35-year-old James entered averaging at least 25 points (25.2 ppg) for the 16th straight season and has played 44 games this season. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the NBA\u2019s career scoring leader with 38,387 points and Karl Malone is second at 36,928. James is on pace to pass Abdul-Jabbar in about three seasons. The top four scorers in NBA history played for the Lakers, who signed James as a free agent in 2018. James passed Bryant in Philadelphia, where the retired Lakers star was born. James, who played in eight consecutive NBA Finals, has 6,911 postseason points with Cleveland and Miami that do not count in the official total. James\u2019 stories in the locker room on Bryant seemed to stretch on as long as his list of milestones. Like another time when he was still in high school and was gifted a pair of red, white and blue Nikes from Bryant. James wore a size 15, Bryant was a 14, but he wore the sneaks anyway. Or the way James was inspired how Bryant always found some sort of slight to use as fuel to improve. James would have a \u201cdream come true\u201d when he lined up side-by-side with Bryant as teammates in the 2008 Olympics as part of the \u201cRedeem Team\u201d and led Team USA to a gold medal in Beijing. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much. The story is just too much,\u201d James said. \u201cThe story doesn\u2019t make sense. Make a long story short, now I\u2019m here in a Lakers uniform, in Philadelphia where he\u2019s from.\u201d Anthony Davis scored 31 points for the Lakers. James went 9 for 18 from the floor, missed five of six 3s, made 10 of 13 free throws and had eight turnovers. \u201cIt was just a great historic moment for our franchise, for LeBron himself,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said."},{"id":29163,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/willie-cauley-stein-trade-warriors-mavs","date":"2020-01-25","title":"Mavericks acquire Willie Cauley-Stein from Warriors","content":" The Dallas Mavericks didn\u2019t take long to settle on a plan to fill a big void created by a season-ending injury to center Dwight Powell. The Mavericks have acquired Willie Cauley-Stein from the Golden State Warriors for a second-round pick in this year\u2019s Draft, the team announced. Dallas made room for Cauley-Stein on the roster by waiving Justin Patton, acquired in a separate trade with Oklahoma City. The Mavericks made the moves three days after Powell, their starting center, tore his right Achilles tendon against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Thunder sent cash along with Patton to Dallas for rookie Isaiah Roby. The 7-foot Cauley-Stein, who missed all of training camp and the exhibition games because of a left foot injury, is averaging 7.9 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.5 assists and a team-leading 1.22 blocks in 41 games with 37 starts for the Warriors. He has scored in double figures 17 times. A video of Cauley-Stein was still included on Golden State\u2019s Twitter feed for \u201cGame Day\u201d ahead of a matchup Friday night against the Pacers at Chase Center. The No. 6 pick in the 2015 draft, Cauley-Stein averaged 10.1 points and 6.4 rebounds with the Sacramento Kings during the 2018-19 season before joining the Warriors. While not addressing the proposed trade specifically, coach Steve Kerr said before the game Marquese Chriss would start at center. \u201cJanuary is a tough month for a lot of reasons,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI played on a lot of teams in my career \u2014 six teams for 15 years. There was always a time where you got a little bit nervous. \u201cOne of the biggest things to do as a coach is to make sure you are communicating with your guys and staying in touch with everybody and making sure everyone is doing OK, but also acknowledging the realities of our job and our work.\u201d Powell, a secondary piece in Dallas\u2019 ill-fated trade for Rajon Rondo five years ago, has evolved into an important contributor for the resurgent Mavericks, particularly alongside second-year sensation Luka Doncic. Dallas is tied with Houston for fifth in the Western Conference and well on the way to earning its first playoff spot in four years, the franchise\u2019s longest stretch without reaching the postseason in 20 years. The 28-year-old Powell was averaging 9.4 points and 5.7 rebounds, numbers that spiked while 7-foot-3 forward Kristaps Porzingis was sidelined for 10 games with right knee soreness. Powell went down with a non-contract injury in the first quarter of a 110-107 loss to the Clippers. Teammate J.J. Barea \u2014 who tore his right Achilles tendon last season \u2014 was distraught as Powell was taken off the court. Patton was the 16th overall pick by Chicago in 2017 but has played sparingly in three seasons with three teams: Minnesota, Philadelphia and Oklahoma City. Roby was a second-round pick by the Mavericks in 2019 and has yet to make his NBA debut. He\u2019s been shuffling back and forth between the Mavericks and the Texas Legends, their G-League affiliate. * * * The Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"id":29169,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/erik-spoelstra-not-happy-jimmy-butler-not-starting-asg","date":"2020-01-25","title":"Spoelstra on Butler not being an All-Star starter: 'It's a joke'","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Erik Spoelstra has a suggestion for All-Star voting: Ditch the positions. A day after the NBA revealed the starters for the Feb. 16 All-Star Game \u2014 two guards and three forwards from each conference \u2014 the Miami Heat coach said he wonders why the league still has players broken down by positions in the voting process for starters. Heat forward Jimmy Butler came up short in the chase for one of the three East frontcourt spots. But he received more fan votes than starting guard Kemba Walker and got more media and fellow player votes than the other East guard starter, Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke that he\u2019s not,\u201d Spoelstra said about Butler. \u201cHopefully this will change things in the future.\u201d Reserves, voted on by the NBA\u2019s head coaches, are not broken down by position. And when captains LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo pick their teams on Feb. 6, they won\u2019t be working within position parameters either. But the starters are still decided by having players, fans and media vote from pools where candidates are grouped by position. \u201cI\u2019m so confused by it,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s ridiculous that we\u2019re still in these antiquated positions. So who\u2019s to say what position Jimmy is? Does it matter? \u2026 These are such antiquated labels. I feel like we moved on from that years ago.\u201d Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers also expressed surprise that Butler wasn\u2019t a starter, especially when considering that Miami entered Friday as the second-best team in the Eastern Conference. \u201cThere (are) no positions and that\u2019s the way the game should be played anyway, in my opinion,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cFours, 3s, 2s, 1s, we just call them players. We don\u2019t call them guards or forwards anymore. We just put them in spots and the more guys you can get to do multiple things, the better your team is.\u201d Rivers said he wasn\u2019t even sure what the process is for choosing starters. When told the player vote plays a part in the process, Rivers expressed disbelief. \u201cThat should stop,\u201d Rivers said, amid laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll just say that up front. \u2026 Players are voting? Wow. I take the subs very seriously. I actually do because it\u2019s important for some of the guys.\u201d Rivers added that he couldn\u2019t believe that Antetokounmpo \u2014 who received more votes from players than anyone else in this year\u2019s All-Star balloting \u2014 was snubbed by 32% of his own colleagues in the league. \u201cGuys vote for their friends and guys vote personal, too,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThat would be my guess.\u201d"},{"id":29165,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-jordan-adam-silver-take-questions-nba-topics","date":"2020-01-24","title":"In Paris, Michael Jordan takes questions on many NBA topics","content":" Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls probably played a role in changing basketball in Europe, when they played in Paris and won a tournament 23 years ago.

Jordan shared the stage with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and Milwaukee owner Marc Lasry and took plenty of queries seeking his opinion on the game\u2019s past, present and future. \u201dI think the European players have expanded the style of basketball because of the versatility that they brought to the game, which I think is good for the game, which has increased the scoring,\u201d Jordan said. \u201dI think it\u2019s just going to keep getting better. It forces us as Americans to play a more-rounded basketball game. That\u2019s what the European players have taught us.\u201d Here are some other notes from the pregame news conference in Paris: JORDAN ON LEBRON Jordan was asked about the constant comparisons between him and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, and if he thinks the now-16-time All-Star selection fits into the club of absolute greatest players in NBA history. Jordan lauded James, and essentially pointed out that the debate simply cannot have a definitive answer. \u201dWe play in different eras,\u201d Jordan said. \u201dHe\u2019s an unbelievable player.

We looked at Zion being an impact player that would bring energy to the game of basketball \u2026 so it was a great opportunity for us.\u201d SILVER ON SCHEDULE Silver said the April board of governors meeting will have plenty of conversation about potential schedule changes \u2014 including an in-season tournament and a play-in tournament to determine the last playoff spots. The league is no longer planning a vote in April, but still has not ruled out the possibility of having any of those changes ready in time for the NBA\u2019s 75th anniversary season in 2021-22. \u201dOriginally what we had proposed is in essence a one-off experiment \u2026 and what we heard back both from our teams and also from our media partners is we should look at something as a multi-year program,\u201d Silver said. \u201dThe ultimate issue isn\u2019t about the vote. It\u2019s about what we should be doing.\u201d PARIS 2021 The Paris Game won\u2019t be a one-year event. Silver said the league will bring two teams to Paris next season, noting that the Bucks and Hornets both asked to return \u2014 but that it\u2019ll be two different clubs instead. \u201dEvery team welcomes the opportunity to represent the NBA,\u201d Jordan said. STERN TRIBUTE Former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who died Jan. 1, was planning to be in Paris for the game. A pregame moment in his memory was held. Stern was the driving force behind how the NBA has grown internationally in the last quarter-century. \u201dThis was very much his vision,\u201d Silver said. Added Jordan: \u201dI wouldn\u2019t be here without David Stern and Adam can say the same thing.\u201d"},{"id":29146,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lauri-markkanen-out-4-6-weeks-pelvis-injury","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Bulls' Lauri Markkanen (right pelvis) out 4-6 weeks","content":" Chicago Bulls third-year forward Lauri Markkanen will be out at least 4-6 weeks with a pelvis injury, the team announced. \u201cChicago Bulls forward Lauri Markkanen underwent an MRI of his right hip at Rush Hospital on Jan. 23 which revealed an early stress reaction of his right pelvis,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cFollowing a period of rest, Markkanen will resume basketball related activities with a full return anticipated in 4-6 weeks.\u201d Markkanen, 22, is averaging 15.0 points and 6.5 rebounds \u2014 both career lows \u2014 in 46 starts for the Bulls.

However, they saw him take a step forward on Friday in taking on more in the team\u2019s practice.  Embiid went through contact drills with the team and has been ramping up his conditioning. Per the team, he is set to be reassessed on Monday. Injuries have piled up a bit of late for Philadelphia. The Sixers got news on Thursday that swingman Josh Richardson would be out 2-3 weeks with a left hamstring strain, leaving their backcourt thinned. Second-year guard Zhaire Smith appeared in just six games last season and has spent much of this season with the G League\u2019s Delaware Blue Coats. He also went through practice on Friday. Embiid is averaging 23.4 points and 12.3 rebounds in 31 games this season and has never played more than 64 games in a season. He suffered the injury to his radial collateral ligament in the ring finger in a victory over Oklahoma City . Since Embiid suffered his injury on Jan. 6 against Oklahoma City, Philadelphia has gone 5-3, scoring notable wins against the Brooklyn Nets (twice) and the Boston Celtics. Philadelphia is 29-17 and the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, but is just three games behind the Miami Heat for the No. 2 seed. The 25-year-old Embiid has struggled with injuries ever since he was drafted with the No. 3 pick of the 2014 draft. He missed his first two seasons with foot injuries. He suffered a broken bone around his left eye and missed games in the 2018 playoffs. The Sixers signed Embiid, a native of Cameroon, to a $148 million, five-year extension that kicked in at the start of the 2018-19 season.

We\u2019re 54% through the 2019-20 season. We\u2019ve been rewarded for our patience with the debut of the No. 1 pick, and not to mention the trade deadline is less than two weeks away. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 14 weekend\u2026 Zion Williamson played his first regular season debut on Thursday, registering 22 points, seven rebounds, three assists and five turnovers in a little over 18 minutes in the Pelicans\u2019 121-117 loss to the Spurs . Here are a few notes and numbers\u2026 Forward vs. center Williamson started alongside Derrick Favors and, through the first three quarters, he had played 9:50 at power forward and just 1:51 at center. Then he played 6:37 at center in the fourth quarter , when he scored 17 of his 22 points. In total, the Pelicans outscored the Spurs, 29-21 in 8:28 with Williamson at the five. (They were outscored, 26-21, with Williamson at the four.) Including his preseason minutes, New Orleans is a plus-52 in 54:03 with Williamson at center. Interestingly, all those preseason minutes were played with Brandon Ingram, Nicolo Melli or Kenrich Williams playing the four alongside Williamson. But all of his minutes at the five on Wednesday were played alongside four guards. That may be just a result of a few different circumstances. Williams is injured and Melli played just over a minute, late in the first quarter. And all of Williamson\u2019s minutes at the five were at the start of the second and fourth quarters, when Ingram was on the bench. In time, we\u2019ll certainly see some minutes with Williamson at the five and Ingram at the four, what may be the Pelicans\u2019 most potent configuration. Pushing the pace The Pelicans rank fifth in both pace (103.3 possessions per 48 minutes) and fast break points per game (16.4). And they don\u2019t just run off live rebounds and turnovers. On Wednesday, one of Williamson\u2019s buckets was a direct result of Lonzo Ball pushing the ball after a Spurs score. With Ball crossing midcourt with 21 seconds on the shot clock and DeMar DeRozan trailing the play, the Spurs got cross-matched. Jakob Poeltl picked up Ball and DeRozan was forced to match up with Williamson trailing the play. Williamson took DeRozan into the paint and Ball lofted a lob pass over the helpless defender. \u201cIt\u2019s great playing with a guy like that,\u201d Williamson told reporters on Friday, referencing Ball. \u201cI can make cuts off the ball sometimes to break the play. I know he\u2019s going to see me and try to find me\u2026 I think it definitely opens up the game for me a lot with a player like him.\u201d Ball isn\u2019t just good a pushing the pace via the dribble. According to Second Spectrum tracking, he ranks sixth in the league with 2.2 pass-ahead passes per game. The Pelicans rank third among teams at 6.2 per game, and the more their guards put defenses on their heels, the more opportunities Williamson will have to do damage on the move. Everything is a mismatch Of course, two possessions after that lob over DeRozan, Williamson was too quick for Poeltl after the Spurs\u2019 back-up center blocked Williamson\u2019s initial shot. Williamson\u2019s 4-for-4 from 3-point range in his debut was obviously a little fluky. His shooting form isn\u2019t great and his shot is flat. But the No. 1 pick doesn\u2019t have to be an above-average 3-point shooter to be a problem for opposing defenses, especially when he\u2019s playing the five and surrounded by four other guys that can shoot. The Pelicans\u2019 complete a three-game homestand with a couple of tough opponents this weekend. They host the Nuggets on Friday (8 ET, League Pass) and the Celtics on Sunday (6 ET, ESPN).  Former Pelican Anthony Davis has played about 65% of his minutes at power forward this season, down from *54% over his last two seasons in New Orleans. The Lakers\u2019 win in Brooklyn on Thursday was the first game that either JaVale McGee (who was out with an illness) or Dwight Howard has missed this season, and the two centers have combined to average a little more than 37 minutes per game. * The 54% is if you call the 6-8 Julius Randle the center in last season\u2019s Davis-Randle frontline. If not, Davis only played 4% of his minutes at power forward last season. He played 49% at the four the season before ( alongside DeMarcus Cousins and Emeka Okafor ). With the increase in minutes at the four, Davis has seen an increase in the percentage of his shots that have come from outside the paint. He\u2019s a little more of a jump-shooter now than he was the last two seasons. He hasn\u2019t been a very effective jump-shooter, though. Davis has an effective field goal percentage of 39.4% on shots from outside the paint, a mark that ranks 117th among 122 players who have taken at least 200 shots from the outside (not including backcourt shots). Davis still ranks fifth in the league with 13.2 points in the paint per game . His 75.1% shooting in the restricted area is the best mark among 36 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts . But among 163 players with at least 100 shots both inside and outside, only Jabari Parker has a bigger differential between his field goal percentage in the paint and his effective field goal percentage from outside the paint. We think of Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James and Ben Simmons as the trio of stars against whom you have to \u201cwall up,\u201d forcing them to beat you over the top. Davis is a different kind of player and keeping him from scoring inside is a lot easier said than done, but he\u2019s in that category of guys who are much more effective inside than they are from the perimeter. Davis could improve his effective field goal percentage on jumpers by turning some mid-range shots into 3-point attempts. He has seen an increase in his ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts in each of the last three seasons (from 0.2 in 2016-17 to 0.8 this season), but that ratio could (and should) be higher. Davis\u2019 34.2% from mid-range ranks 43rd among 47 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts . \u201cHe\u2019s been, throughout his career, at about one or two 3-pointers per game ,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel told NBA.com this week. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get him to up that to four or five. While he\u2019s doing that, he\u2019s a developing shooter from the perimeter, from the standpoint finding more opportunities to get clean looks.\u201d Time will tell if Davis continues to play almost twice as much at the four as he does at the five, though the percentage of his shots that have come in the paint hasn\u2019t been much higher when he\u2019s played center (59%) than it has when he\u2019s played next to McGee or Howard (57%). The Lakers\u2019 defense has been great in those minutes with him at the five, but the offense has been sub-par ( 104.8 points scored per 100 possessions ), in part because Kyle Kuzma, Danny Green, James and Troy Daniels have all shot worse from 3-point range in those minutes (30% combined) than they have otherwise. Green has shot 44% from beyond the arc with Davis at the four and just 25% with Davis at the five . That latter number comes with a small sample size (48 attempts) and will probably improve with time. After sweeping their New York back-to-back, the Lakers complete their five-game trip in Philadelphia on Saturday (8:30 ET, ABC). They then head home for their third meeting with the Clippers on Tuesday (10 ET, TNT).  After their win in Portland on Thursday, the Dallas Mavericks (at 28-16) are a half game ahead of the Houston Rockets (27-16) for fifth place in the Western Conference. But are they even better than that? While the Mavericks have the league\u2019s 10th best record , they have its third best point differential (+7.1 per game), that of a team that\u2019s 32-12. How does that work? Well, the Mavs\u2019 average margin of victory in their 28 wins is 14.7 points. Their average margin of defeat in their 16 losses is 6.3. With their loss to the Clippers on Tuesday (in which they led by one with less than three minutes to go), the Mavs are 10-13 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes . The Charlotte Hornets (12-13) and Cleveland Cavaliers (9-10) have been better than that in \u201cclutch\u201d games. While the Mavs have scored 116.4 points per 100 possessions ( No. 1 in the league ) overall, they\u2019ve scored just 93.2 ( 28th ) with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. After shooting 6-for-11 on shots to tie or take the lead in the last minute of the fourth or OT last season, Luka Doncic is 0-for-6 this season. (No other player has more than four attempts without a make in those situations.) With better luck in close games, the Mavs might be in second place in the West instead of sixth. In fact, if you counted only games that weren\u2019t within five points in the last five minutes, the Mavs would have the best record in the West. In the East, the Detroit Pistons would be in playoff position if we only counted games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Of course, close games count. Execution on high-leverage possession matters. Of the 668 games the league has played through Thursday, 344 (51%) have been within five points in the last five minutes. No team has played more clutch games than the Oklahoma City Thunder , who have been within five in the last five in 31 (69%) of their 48 games. The experience and execution of Chris Paul ( who has shot 54% on 69 clutch shots ) has been huge, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is also 24-for-36 (67%) with the score within five in the last five. The Thunder\u2019s fortunes in close games has them in seventh place in the West. And one may wonder how much that affects their approach to trade talks with the deadline now less than two weeks away. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Some action from across the pond For the first time in NBA history, two teams will play a regular season game in Paris, France when the Bucks \u201cvisit\u201d the Hornets today ( 3 ET, NBA TV ). As far as the pregame lead-up goes, the Hornets and Bucks are enjoying themselves getting in some soccer , brushing up on their French or just reflecting on their NBA journey . As for on the court, the Bucks will be going for their eighth straight win. If they do so, it would mark the second time this season they have won eight more games in a row. 2. Conference elites clash in Miami The Heat and Clippers are not only elite teams overall, but the same is also true when it comes to facing top-flight teams from the opposing conference. Miami ranks fourth in the East ( 11-7, 66.1 win percentage ) when facing West teams over .500, while the Clippers are tops in the West ( 12-4, .750 ) when playing East teams over .500. Throw in that this is a matchup of two of the Top 5 players in our latest Kia MVP Ladder \u2014 the Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard and the Heat\u2019s Jimmy Butler \u2014 and there\u2019s no way this game cannot be enticing. 3. Time for Zion\u2019s encore Thank goodness for a League Pass free preview, as we\u2019ll all have no reason to miss Zion Williamson\u2019s second career game tonight. His Pelicans host the Nuggets ( 8 ET ) and he\u2019ll be looking to follow up that historic 22-point debut on Wednesday against the Spurs . After all those thrills, though, Williamson is still searching for career win No. 1 and will be facing a Nuggets squad that has been ransacked by injuries . The recent injury to Mason Plumlee may give Nuggets rookie Michael Porter Jr. a bigger role, which could mean we get a Williamson vs. Porter Jr. rookie showdown at times tonight. 4. Pacers keeping up in East Save for a blowout loss in Salt Lake City on Monday , Indiana has been sharp in its last seven games. There are the six wins, of course, in that span. But there is also the play from Domantas Sabonis, who is averaging 11.7 rebounds per game during that span. Additionally, T.J. Warren has scored 20 or more points in 10 of his last 17 games and is shooting 54 percent from the field and 39.1 percent from 3-point range in January. Indiana visits struggling Golden State ( 10:30, NBA TV ) and is trying to stay on track as the return of Victor Oladipo nears . 5. On this date: Carmelo\u2019s career night Back in the 2013-14 season, Carmelo Anthony was in the midst of one of his best overall seasons and the Knicks were in the midst of a 50-win season, too. On Jan. 24, 2014, Anthony posted a super-efficient 62 points (23-for-35 shooting overall, 6-for-11 on 3-pointers) in a win against the Charlotte Bobcats. In doing so, Anthony set a Knicks franchise record, his own career-high and the record for most points scored by any player at Madison Square Garden."},{"id":29199,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-jan-24-edition","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Hot streak fuels Kawhi Leonard's rise","content":" The conversation started out innocently enough. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing your glasses?\u201d a trusted Western Conference executive texted me late Wednesday night. \u201cI\u2019m tired of having to clean them all the time when I\u2019m on [the NBA TV] set, plus there\u2019s the glare,\u201d I responded, not knowing the punchline was coming next. \u201cPut them on and do me a favor and tell me where Kawhi [Leonard] is on your MVP Ladder?\u201d the executive replied. Nice \u2026 now it\u2019s not just the folks who fill up the Kia MVP Mailbag each week who have got jokes. Leonard\u2019s absence from the top five of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder is over, at least for the time being. The LA Clippers\u2019 star and reigning Finals MVP moves up to No. 3 from No. 7 on the strength of his recent scoring surge. Leonard has scored 30 or more points in each of his past six games, tying the longest such streak of his career. It\u2019s also the longest streak of its kind for a Clippers player since World B. Free set a team record with 11 straight 30-point games in January of 1980 (which was 11 years before Leonard was born). Leonard sat out Wednesday\u2019s 102-95 loss in Atlanta , adhering to his program of not playing back-to-backs. But he is expected to play Friday night in Miami ( 8 ET, ESPN ). The Clippers have won eight of their last 11 games and weathered whatever has come their way, including working some nights without Leonard, Paul George and Patrick Beverley \u2014 although that was the case (and it didn\u2019t result in a win) vs. the Hawks. Anyone upset with the way Leonard is handling his business, though, need only look back at what his load management produced for the Toronto Raptors last season. (This season, the Clippers have termed it as \u201cinjury management,\u201d but it is the same concept). If the Clippers finish this season the same way \u2014 with Kawhi healthy, rested and dominant in the final days of the championship chase \u2014 his injury management process won \u2019 t be worth the time that can be wasted talking about the merits of it. * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 30.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.1 steals, 1.0 blocks Giannis is the captain for the Eastern Conference All-Stars for the second straight season, opposite LeBron James, and will celebrate by going at the Charlotte Hornets in Paris on Friday ( 3 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). Antetokounmpo is the league\u2019s second-leading scorer and ranks fifth in rebounds while leading the Bucks to the best record in the league. He was a no-brainer pick for captain from all voting factions. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 25.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 10.8 assists, 1.3 steals LeBron and the Lakers are the best road team (20-4) in the league and are battling through their Grammy road trip . They opened with a win in Houston , got routed in Boston and followed that up with back-to-back wins in New York (Knicks Wednesday) and Nets (Thursday). LeBron turned in his 10th triple-double (27 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists) of the season (and 91st of his career ) against the Nets. He needs 18 points to pass Kobe Bryant for third place on the NBA career scoring list . Last week: No. 7 Season stats: 27.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.0 steals Lost in all the chatter about injury management is that Leonard is putting up career highs in scoring, rebounding and assists while also ranking third in the league in steals. He\u2019s doing all this for a title-contending Clippers squad, who have a huge test ahead on Friday in Miami ( 8 p.m. ET, ESPN ). Leonard earned his fourth career All-Star nod and fourth career starting bid Thursday, proof that the fans, players and media members who voted don\u2019t care about the outside noise. Last week: No. 3 Season stats: 29.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.0 assists, 1.1 steals Doncic was his usual brilliant self in Thursday\u2019s 133-125 win in Portland , finishing with 27 points, nine assists and six rebounds. He has the Mavericks just five wins away from last season\u2019s win total (33), which is perhaps more impressive than any of the individual milestones he\u2019s achieved this season (one in which he is a newly minted All-Star and All-Star starter ). Doncic, remarkably, is fitting all of this in prior to his 21st birthday (which is on Feb. 28). Last week: No. 4 Season stats: 20.3 points, 7.0 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 1.8 steals Not that he needs any more motivation to fuel his fire, but Thursday\u2019s All-Star starters announcement had to sting a little bit for Butler. He finished third in the media voting, fourth in the fan voting \u2026 and sixth in the player voting . He lost on that third frontcourt starting spot to Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. If his sore knee doesn\u2019t sideline him tonight with the Clippers in town, we\u2019re expected to see him and his grimy best with Leonard in the building. * * * * * * 6.

When NBA players hear their name in rap songs","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 He was asleep in Greece, halfway around the world, enjoying an escape before the start of his fourth NBA season when he was disturbed by the incessant buzzing of a cell phone on vibrate. Devin Booker tried to ignore the noise at first, then it dawned on him (at dawn) that this could be important. The first thought that ran through his groggy head: Maybe I was traded by the Suns. Well, no, this was bigger, actually: He was dropped by Drake. Listen:  Apple Music BASE:LINE Playlist Friends and teammates called to tell him he was mentioned in the country\u2019s biggest hit. Somewhat disheveled at that very moment, Booker needed a minute to realize what the fuss was about, and then he saw the verse sent by text: \u201cSee the shots that I took, wet like I\u2019m Book.\u201d The hook was straight from \u201cSicko Mode,\u201d the seven-time platinum song by Travis Scott with an assist from Drake. Released in August of 2018, it was the first song in history to spend 30 weeks in hip-hop\u2019s top 10 rankings. The official video has more than 450 million views on YouTube and Scott performed the song at last year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show. And it was instantly downloaded in a hotel suite in Greece by a Suns guard who felt he\u2019d just splashed the game-winning shot. \u201cObviously I stayed up from that moment and the rest of the day,\u201d Booker said, \u201cjust banging it.\u201d Not only is the song catchy, so is the trend. With astonishing frequency, NBA players are being mentioned in songs, many of them worldwide hits. Artists are name-dropping more players than public address announcers. It\u2019s mainly concentrated in rap and hip-hop, the genres dominating the charts and ingrained in the NBA culture. That\u2019s understandable as the music and sport are each other\u2019s biggest fans. Drake emphasized this in his debut album: \u201cI swear sports and music are so synonymous. \u2018Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us.\u201d Preparations for the Grammys have pushed the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers out of Staples Center this week. But basketball will still represent Sunday at the awards show anyway. A number of presenters, nominees and performers have mentioned NBA players on past or current songs, and this has not gone unnoticed on locker room headphones. Suddenly, there\u2019s another career achievement on the wish-list of players: Win a championship, become an All-Star, make millions and get dropped in a smash hit song. Not necessarily in that order. Chances are solid that if they do get a shout-out, it\u2019ll likely be by Drake, the hitmaker and Raptor-rouser who constantly honors his basketball idols by penciling them into his projects. It wasn\u2019t long ago when Booker sat in Drake\u2019s home in Los Angeles and in the middle of an otherwise innocent conversation came this from the rapper: \u201cMan, I got to put you in a song.\u201d That\u2019s almost like Oscar-winning director Quentin Tarantino promising to write a young actor into a script. Stunned at first, Booker said he forgot about it until weeks later, when the phone calls came in a rush. \u201cThat was a great feeling, man,\u201d Booker said, \u201cfor me, for everybody around me. He\u2019s going to go down as one of the best artists of all time, and to be mentioned in one of his platinum records, wow. And it\u2019s a really good song, too. I was happy I was in a head banger.\u201d One of the nominees for Best Rap Song is titled \u201cA Lot,\u201d and if it wins on Sunday, the applause will be heard from Staples Center to Amway Center in Orlando. A verse written by J. Cole in that song helped inspire Magic guard Markelle Fultz and let the former No. 1 overall Draft pick know that not everyone had given up on his struggling basketball career. Here\u2019s the backstory: J. Cole and Knicks guard Dennis Smith Jr. are both from Fayetteville, N.C., and have known each other for years. Smith is also close to Fultz from NBA Summer League and the two refer to each other as brothers. Roughly a year ago, Smith described how his \u201cbrother\u201d was hurting to the five-time Grammy nominee. Less than a year after being chosen by the Sixers in 2017, Fultz suffered from a shoulder injury and was later diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which robbed him of his full-range shooting motion and jeopardized his future. Fultz played only 33 games his first two seasons and the Sixers virtually gave him to the Magic last February. \u201cHe was going through a situation and it was a tough situation for someone mentally,\u201d Smith Jr. said. \u201cCole said, \u2018Let me holla at him.\u2019 They just locked in. Cole chopped it up with him and one thing led to another. Crazy.\u201d  Here\u2019s the verse J. Cole wrote: \u201cI pray for Markelle \u2019cause they (expletive) up his shot, Just want you to know that you got it Though I never met you, I know that you special And that the Lord blessed you, don\u2019t doubt it Dennis Smith Jr., stay solid.\u201d Billboard Magazine rated \u201cA Lot\u201d by 21 Savage and J. Cole as the No. 6 song of 2019 . It has gone platinum three times and Cole\u2019s lyrics were hailed by critics. Fultz was nearly moved to tears the first time he heard it. \u201cIt was dope,\u201d Fultz said. \u201cHim shouting me out on a song really showed the love and the person he is. I play it a lot, all the time. I love it. To get put in a song is like, dope, an honor.\u201d And evidently it serves as motivation as well. Fultz is healthy and halfway through a redemptive season in Orlando and recently dropped a triple-double on the Lakers in an upset road win. Musicians and songwriters historically never had use for athletes in their lyrics, which were reserved for heartbreak, love and more heartbreak. Even after Simon & Garfunkel had the lonely eyes of a nation wondering \u201c where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio\u201d in their 1968 song, \u201cMrs. Robinson,\u201d songs steered clear of sports. The name-dropping began with the popularity of hip-hop and rap because those artists came from the same neighborhood as the players. Rapper Kurtis Blow broke ground in 1984 with his iconic \u201cBasketball,\u201d which became an anthem in arenas and gyms everywhere. As the background singers in the song wailed \u201c they\u2019re playing basketball!\u201d he dropped an entire generation of players in six minutes and 26 seconds including, \u201cMagic, Bird and Bernard King, and number 33 my man, Kareem.\u201d Suddenly the sport and its players were being romanticized almost as much as the girl next door. Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Kendrick Lamar, Wale, Rick Ross \u2026 almost every mega-star is scribbling names of ballers today. Some lyrics are clever, as when Kanye said in \u201cThe Glory\u201d: \u201cClass back in session so I upped it a grade. Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade.\u201d Drake is the most prolific; he\u2019s firing off riffs on whomever catches his hoop imagination, mostly LeBron James, a popular subject with the rap culture. It was Drake who famously crowned Stephen Curry with the ultimate nickname of respect in his 2014 song \u201c0 to 100\u201d with: \u201cI been Steph Curry with the shot, Been cookin\u2019 with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy\u201d Drake also wrote \u201c6 Man\u201d to get Lou Williams, then with the Raptors, votes for the Kia Sixth Man Award in 2015. Drake evidently has sway as Williams won the first of three career Sixth Man awards that year. \u201cWhen I first heard it, of course I liked it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cOne of the biggest artists in the world, having a song about you, being Sixth Man, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d It\u2019s not just the stars getting in songs as a wide swath of current and former player names have been dropped. They\u2019ve mainly appeared on less popular songs \u2014 and some probably don\u2019t even know it. The roll call includes Danny Ainge, Jeff Hornacek, Danilo Gallinari, Peja Stojakovic, Mookie Blaylock, John Starks, Steve Nash, Chauncey Billups, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo and even a coach, the late Chuck Daly. The list runs longer than the regular season. Vince Carter, the only player to play in four different decades, has been dropped multiple times, by Bow Wow (in a cover of \u201cBasketball\u201d), 2 Chainz, Drake and most recently Compton rapper, Roddy Ricch. Since he\u2019s still on the court at his advanced age, Carter has the unique experience of sharing the same playlist as his kids. \u201cI have a 14-year-old daughter and one day she says, \u2018Dad, you know who Roddy Ricch is?\u2019 Well, I already knew I was mentioned in one of his songs, and I knew where she was going with the question, but I played along and said, \u2018I have no idea. Who\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d Carter said.  Five years ago, an artist desperate for a record deal wrote his first song by linking his industry struggles with his favorite player. Post Malone called it \u201cWhite Iverson\u201d and it instantly went viral on SoundCloud. Allen Iverson loved it so much he had it played at his 40th birthday party. With a boost from the single, Malone\u2019s debut album, \u201cStoney,\u201d went triple platinum. Today, his songs are sprinkled with NBA drops. In his 2018 song, \u201cWow,\u201d he wrote: \u201cCatch me on the block like I\u2019m Mutombo, 750 Lambo in the Utah snow.\u201d  There\u2019s a song ranked No. 3 on Rolling Stone \u2019s list of the best songs of the 2000s that combined the vocals of two of this generation\u2019s biggest hit-makers: Jay-Z and Beyonce. Anyone named-dropped on such a hit was therefore promised immortality. However, the first time he heard it, Nick Van Exel wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cIt was OK,\u201d Van Exel said. \u201cI was a Jay-Z fan but I wasn\u2019t rocking to that song.\u201d Jay-Z wrote in the 2003 song \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d: \u201cThe ROC handle like Van Exel, I shake phonies, man, you can\u2019t get next to\u201d in a salute to the crafty dribbling of Van Exel (who then played for the Mavericks). Jay-Z was likely inspired by the 2003 Mavs-Kings series in the West semifinals, in which Van Exel scored 36 points in Game 2 and 40 points in Game 3. \u201cWe had that great playoff run and later on, people were telling me about the song,\u201d Van Exel said. \u201cAnd then when you went in the clubs that summer, that was the song they were playing, and I\u2019d see people pointing at me. It was a good night when that song came on. Then, on the radio, it was the only thing you\u2019d hear. So I was like, all right, this is my jam right here. This is the jam.\u201d Jay-Z invited Van Exel to the opening of his Manhattan restaurant, the 40-40 Club, then later ran into him in Cancun. The two clicked, with Van Exel pleasantly surprised and impressed by the down-to-earth demeanor of the rap icon. \u201cHe\u2019s a basketball fan,\u201d Van Exel said, \u201cand I guess he saw me play and said, \u2018Man, this boy is killing it.\u2019 I also assume my last name was a challenge for him to word-play. The way he spun it and pulled it off, I thought that was nice. I officially crowned him the champ.\u201d  Players mentioned in songs see it as a high honor, but it can get weird when the song is played in a room full of people and heads turn. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things I enjoy when I\u2019m by myself,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWhen my part comes on and everybody starts looking at me, that\u2019s when it\u2019s uncomfortable. I\u2019d rather just listen to it by myself.\u201d Not so for Smith Jr., who said: \u201cWhen I first heard \u2018A Lot,\u2019 I was in the car with my friends and everybody just turned up. I was like, \u2018Wind it back, play it again.\u2019 People still hit me up on social media with the tagline \u2018stay solid\u2019 that Cole used in the song. That\u2019s good advice for me and Markelle and anyone. Stay solid.\u201d With basketball and music now forming a strong alliance, the number of NBA players used in songs doesn\u2019t appear ready to end. When the Grammys are over and the industry gets back to work Monday, there\u2019ll be an artist somewhere who\u2019ll put a pen to paper while writing the next big hit and ask himself: What rhymes with \u201cAntetokounmpo?\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Once his career scoring total climbs to 33,644 points, he will pass a player revered by Lakers fans worldwide: Kobe Bryant. However upset some Lakers fans may be about James supplanting Bryant on the all-time scoring charts, Bryant himself is not giving it a second thought. To him, being concerned about such matters is akin to foolishness. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people want that or want to have this kind of contentious thing where you don\u2019t want records to be broken or people there to surpass you,\u201d Bryant told USA Today Sports\u2019 Mark Medina in an story published Wednesday. \u201cYou should be happy for the person that comes after you to be able to surpass things that you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s kind of juvenile to think or to behave any other way.\u201d James scored 27 points Thursday in a 128-113 road win against the Brooklyn Nets. The Lakers will next face the 76ers in Philadelphia ( 8:30 ET, ABC ) on Saturday. James is averaging 24 ppg over his last six games and has scored 30 or more in two of those six games. This season, the 35-year-old James is averaging 25.2 ppg and a league-best 10.8 apg. He has piled up 10 triple-doubles, which trails only Magic Johnson\u2019s single-season franchise record of 13. In short, James has been playing at a much higher level after injuries sapped his 2018-19 debut campaign with the Lakers and he missed the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. Bryant has been watching this season and admiring James\u2019 performance, and was even on hand with daughter Gianna for a Nov. 18 win against the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cHe\u2019s coming in this year with a chip on his shoulder obviously because of what everybody was saying that he\u2019s washed up,\u201d Bryant told USA Today Sports. \u201cWhen I first came into the league, the average age was like 33 or 32. Now that you\u2019re 35, [the narrative], is \u2018You\u2019re washed up and you\u2019re dying.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of silly. But I think he\u2019s doing a fantastic job.\u201d James has kept himself all season and has only missed two games after being sidelined for a career-high 27 of them last season. That durability has allowed James to move in on Bryant on the scoring list. As his career waned, Bryant dealt with injuries, including ones to his left Achillies, left knee and right shoulder that caused him to miss a combined 139 games in his final three seasons. Those maladies kept Bryant from overtaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 career points) or Karl Malone (36,928) on the all-time scoring list. However, he told USA Today Sports he didn\u2019t regret not being able to move up higher on the list, but instead wished his Lakers teams could have faced off against James\u2019 Cavs or Miami Heat in The Finals. Bryant, who won an Academy Award for his 2018 short film \u201cDear Basketball\u201d, likened that missed Finals showdown to an award chase. \u201cCompetition is about competition,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s like competing with things that you can control. If you\u2019re competing as somebody mano a mano, it\u2019s different. Of course, you want to win. But if it\u2019s things that aren\u2019t in your control? \u201cI can\u2019t control whether you win an Oscar or not. You do the best that you can and you make the story as good as you can make it and then you sit down and you just chill. If our name wasn\u2019t getting called in that envelope, I would\u2019ve been happy for the group that won because I know the amount of work that goes into that and respect that.\u201d "},{"id":29167,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-frank-vogel-coach-team-lebron-all-star-game","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Lakers' Vogel to coach Team LeBron in 2020 All-Star Game","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers head coach Frank Vogel and his staff will coach Team LeBron in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 16 at the United Center in Chicago.

NBA All-Star 2020 will reach fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 40 languages. With tonight\u2019s 128-113 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, the Lakers (36-9, .800) clinched at least a tie for the best record in the Western Conference through games played on Sunday, Feb. 2. The Utah Jazz is the only team with the potential to tie the Lakers for the best record in the Western Conference through games played on Feb. 2. According to NBA rules, the first tiebreaker to determine an All-Star Game head coach is better head-to-head record. The Lakers have won both games against the Jazz this season and the teams do not meet again until March, giving Vogel the tiebreaker over Utah head coach Quin Snyder. As a result, Vogel has earned the spot to coach Team LeBron over the 13 other eligible Western Conference head coaches. The Denver Nuggets\u2019 Michael Malone was ineligible because he served as a head coach in last year\u2019s NBA All-Star Game.  Each head coach in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game will lead the team that includes the captain from the same conference. Vogel and his staff will coach the All-Star team captained by their own player, the Lakers\u2019 LeBron James. The eligible head coach of the team with the Eastern Conference\u2019s best record through games played on Feb. 2 will coach the All-Star team captained by the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo. Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer is ineligible because he served as a head coach in last year\u2019s NBA All-Star Game. This marks the second NBA All-Star Game head coaching honor for Vogel, who led the Eastern Conference in the 2014 All-Star Game as head coach of the Indiana Pacers.  He coached the Pacers for five and a half seasons from 2011-16 and guided them to back-to-back Eastern Conference Finals in 2013 and 2014.

In the Eastern Conference, Antetokounmpo (frontcourt) is joined in the starter pool by the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Joel Embiid (frontcourt), the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Pascal Siakam (frontcourt), the Boston Celtics\u2019 Kemba Walker (guard) and the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young (guard. James has been named an NBA All-Star for the 16th time, moving into sole possession of third place for the most selections in league history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (19) and Kobe Bryant (18). When he takes the court in Chicago, James will set the NBA record for All-Star starts with 16, one more than Bryant (15). With Don\u010di\u0107, 20, and Young, 21, selected as starters, this marks the second time that an NBA All-Star Game will include multiple 21-and-under starters \u2013 a scenario that played out in the 1998 All-Star Game with Bryant (19) and Kevin Garnett (21). The last time multiple second-year NBA players started the same All-Star Game, as Don\u010di\u0107 and Young are set to do in Chicago, was the 1996 All-Star Game (Grant Hill and Jason Kidd). The All-Star Game starters were announced tonight by TNT during the TNT NBA Tip-Off presented by Autotrader pregame show. TNT will unveil the All-Star Game reserves (seven players from each conference), as selected by NBA head coaches, on Thursday, Jan. 30 at 7 p.m. ET during TNT NBA Tip-Off. In the 2020 NBA All-Star Draft, James and Antetokounmpo will draft the eight remaining players from the starter pool in the First Round and then all 14 players from the reserve pool in the Second Round. The captains will make their selections without regard to a player\u2019s conference affiliation or position. By virtue of being the top overall finisher in fan voting, James will make the first pick in the First Round (Starters) during the NBA All-Star Draft. Antetokounmpo will have the first pick in the Second Round (Reserves). After the first pick in a round, picks will alternate until all players in that round have been selected. Western Conference \u2022 Anthony Davis, Lakers (7 th All-Star selection): The eight-year veteran is an NBA All-Star for the seventh year in a row. He scored a record 52 points in the 2017 All-Star Game in New Orleans. \u2022 Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Mavericks (1 st All-Star selection): Don\u010di\u0107, who turns 21 on Feb. 28, is set to become the youngest European player to appear in an All-Star Game and the ninth player in NBA history to play in an All-Star Game at 20 or younger. He is the youngest All-Star starter since 20-year-old James in 2005. \u2022 James Harden, Rockets (8 th All-Star selection): The 2019-20 NBA scoring leader has been an All-Star in all eight seasons with Houston, matching Yao Ming for the second-most All-Star selections in Rockets history behind Hakeem Olajuwon (12). Harden has been voted to start for the fourth consecutive year. \u2022 LeBron James, Lakers (16 th All-Star selection): This will be James\u2019 16 th All-Star Game start in a row, a streak that began in his second NBA season. A three-time All-Star Game MVP, James has scored the most points in All-Star Game history (362). \u2022 Kawhi Leonard, Clippers (4 th All-Star selection): Leonard has been named a starter all four times as an All-Star. After starting two All-Star Games with the San Antonio Spurs and one with the Raptors, Leonard is set to become the seventh player in NBA history to start All-Star Games with three franchises. Eastern Conference \u2022 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks (4 th All-Star selection): The reigning Kia NBA MVP is an All-Star starter for the fourth consecutive year and a team captain for the second straight year. He has the highest scoring average in All-Star Game history with 28.0 points per game. \u2022 Joel Embiid, 76ers (3 rd All-Star selection): Embiid is the first 76ers player to be named a starter in three consecutive All-Star Games since Allen Iverson was selected to start seven straight times from 2000-06. \u2022 Pascal Siakam, Raptors (1 st All-Star selection): After averaging 6.0 points per game over his first two NBA seasons as the 27 th pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, Siakam won the 2018-19 Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award and now will be the first NBA G League veteran to start an NBA All-Star Game. Like Embiid, Siakam is a Cameroon native and former Basketball Without Borders (BWB) camper. \u2022 Kemba Walker, Celtics (4 th All-Star selection): This is the fourth consecutive All-Star nod for Walker, who made his first All-Star Game start last season as a member of the Charlotte Hornets. \u2022 Trae Young, Hawks (1 st All-Star selection): Young, playing his second NBA season, is the first Hawks player in 44 years to earn an All-Star selection in one of his first two seasons. Fans accounted for 50 percent of the vote to determine the NBA All-Star Game starters, while current NBA players and a media panel accounted for 25 percent each. James (6,275,459 fan votes) and Antetokounmpo (5,902,286 fan votes) led their respective conferences and position groups in fan voting. Don\u010di\u0107 (6,111,735 fan votes) and Young (2,829,969 fan votes) also topped their respective position groups in fan voting.

James, the catalyst for the Western Conference-leading Los Angeles Lakers, will captain the Western Conference team for the second straight season. Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 star and reigning Kia MVP, captains the Eastern Conference team for a second straight season as well. As the top vote-getters in their respective conferences, James and Antetokounmpo are the players responsible for choosing sides for the Feb. 16 showcase game at Chicago\u2019s United Center. The All-Star Draft will take place on Feb. 6 on TNT at 7 p.m. ET. A fresh face in the starters\u2019 mix this season is Dallas wunderkind Luka Doncic, who joins Houston\u2019s James Harden as the two starters in the backcourt. Clippers forward and reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Lakers forward Anthony Davis round out the All-L.A. frontcourt. Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker is joined by Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young in the East backcourt. Like Doncic, Young is a first-time All-Star and starter in just his second NBA season. Antetokounmpo will be flanked by Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid and Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam, another first time All-Star and starter, in the East frontcourt. Fans accounted for 50 percent of the vote to determine the NBA All-Star Game starters, while current NBA players and a media panel accounted for 25 percent each. James (6,275,459 fan votes) and Antetokounmpo (5,902,286 fan votes) led their respective conferences and position groups in fan voting. Don\u010di\u0107 (6,111,735 fan votes) and Young (2,829,969 fan votes) also topped their respective position groups in fan voting. The starters were revealed Thursday on TNT. As captains, James and Antetokounmpo will choose from a player pool that includes the other eight starters, regardless of conference designation, and 14 reserves (seven from each conference) chosen by NBA head coaches. Doncic and Young finished 1-2 in Rookie of the Year voting last season and this season they are the only two players in the league to rank in the top five in both points and assists. They were traded for each other on Draft night and will be linked together throughout their careers. They\u2019ll share this milestone, playing and starting in their first All-Star Game. And depending on how the player draft breaks down, they could wind up on the same team. Siakam\u2019s meteoric rise continues with his starting nod. The winner of the Most Improved Award last season, he helped the Raptors win the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy last summer while teaming up with Leonard. When Leonard departed for the Clippers via free agency, Siakam stepped into the role as the Raptors\u2019 No. 1 option and has thrived. The reserves will be announced next Thursday exclusively on TNT. Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal, Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons, Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis and Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry lead the list of potential reserves from the Eastern Conference.

Richardson had scored 15 or more points in seven of the past eight games, He did not speak to reporters following the game, but the team said he will be re-evaluated Thursday. Richardson, who is averaging 15.4 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists, missed six games in late November and early December because of a right hamstring injury. The Sixers are already without star center Joel Embiid, who has missed eight straight games after undergoing surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left hand.

And if you blinked, you might have missed his coming-out party. In a stretch of just over three minutes, the No. 1 pick from the 2019 draft electrified the Smoothie King Center, scoring 17 straight points while hitting 6-of-8 shots, going 4-for-4 on 3-pointers and nearly willing the Pelicans to a win. Forget Rookie of the Year; New Orleans fans were raining down \u201cM-V-P!\u201d chants on their superstar. \u201cIt was everything I dreamed of, except the losing part,\u201d Williamson said after playing 18 memorable minutes in the 121-117 loss to the Spurs . \u201cJust the energy the crowd brought, the energy the city brought, it was electric and I\u2019m just grateful that they did that. So it was a dream come true to finally get out there, but at the end of the day I did want to win, so we\u2019ve got to look to the next game.\u201d What started as a forgettable debut turned quickly into something magical, and in an instant it became clear that Zion is something special. \u201cThere\u2019s just a really, really high ceiling he can reach,\u201d coach Alvin Gentry said afterward. Where Williamson goes from here is uncertain, but if Wednesday night was any indication, the Pelicans are must-see viewing from here on out. Just don\u2019t stop watching \u2014 you might miss something special. * * * Last week: No. 1 On the night Zion burst on to the scene, the ROY leader in the clubhouse was having the worst game of his young career. Morant was held to two points \u2014 the lowest-scoring game of his young career \u2014 and five assists on just 1-for-5 shooting in 23 minutes. The Grizzlies were shut down by the Celtics, who built a 38-point lead and cruised to a 119-95 win in Boston. Morant started the week with 16 and eight assists in the Grizzlies\u2019 seventh straight win, but went 6-for-19 in two losses to close out the week. With Kendrick Nunn putting up big numbers and Zion capturing the nation\u2019s imagination, Morant can\u2019t just assume he\u2019s got ROY locked up. Last week: No. 2 Nunn keeps his spot after another exceptional week. In four games, Nunn averaged 19.8 ppg, 4.0 rpg and 3.3 apg while shooting 50% overall (and 10-for-22 on 3-pointers). The Heat went 3-1 with a pair of overtime wins and Nunn said he never lost confidence despite struggling with his shot earlier in the month. \u201c[I\u2019m] not deferring any,\u201d Nunn said earlier this week . \u201cThat\u2019s not what I like to do or what my job is on the team. They want me to play to my strengths and be aggressive every time I\u2019m on the floor. If that\u2019s 1 minute or 20 minutes, every time I\u2019m on the floor it\u2019s to be aggressive so I\u2019m sticking with that.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Before missing Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Rockets with tightness in his back, Porter Jr. was on the best stretch of his season. Porter scored in double digits in each of his last five games , averaging 16.0 ppg, 8.8 rpg and shooting 55.8% overall and 52.6% on 3-pointers. Porter caught everyone\u2019s attention Monday, putting up 20 points and 14 rebounds in a 107-100 win over the Wolves , his second double-double in four days. \u201cHe\u2019s impacting the game at such a high level. He\u2019s growing up in front of our eyes,\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. \u2018 Last week: Not ranked There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s not perfect about Thybulle\u2019s game, but what he brings to the Sixers goes far beyond the box score. If you look only at offensive statistics, you might wonder why Thybulle gets such a high spot \u2014 7.0 ppg on 10-for-31 shooting in four games this week (and 5-for-22 on 3-pointers). But Thybulle is giving the Sixers so much more in his 30-plus minutes per game ( they\u2019re 17-2 when be plays 20-plus minutes). In those same four games, Thybulle wreaked havoc on defense, tallying nine steals and four blocks. \u201cI just think about what it\u2019s like for the other team,\u201d Thybulle said after getting four steals in a big win over the Nets. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s intimidating to see our length and moreso our hustle; we lay our hearts out on the court on the defensive end just to make life hard for the other teams.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Remember Eric Paschall? He was a regular early in the season as he burst onto the scene for the banged-up Warriors. Well, after a stretch in mid-December that saw his production dip as he dealt with hip injuries, Paschall has started putting up big numbers again over the last two weeks. He\u2019s scored in double digits in seven straight and nine of 11 games in January, averaging 17.3 ppg and 7.8 rpg in four games this week, highlighted by a 20-point, nine-rebound showing in a win over the Magic, then 22 and 13 in an OT loss in Portland. Paschall credits his resurgence to his December in which he missed a week of action and saw his playing time dip. \u201cI feel those injuries were kind of a blessing in disguise in terms of my body and getting the proper rest I needed,\u201d Paschall said. \u201cYour rookie year is probably your longest year because right after college you\u2019re going to pre-draft workouts, flying across the country for a workout, maybe have a back-to-back workout. Right after that, you go into training camp for summer league. Right after that, you go into training camp. So, you don\u2019t really get a lot of time off.

Although the Pelicans ultimately fell to the visiting San Antonio Spurs, 121-117 , on Wednesday night, that couldn\u2019t overshadow the tantalizing performance Williamson delivered in defeat. After a three-month wait, Pelicans and NBA fans finally got a small look at what Williamson might be capable of and delighted in it all. We could go on and on about this game, but instead we\u2019ll attempt to put it in context with some stats from the night as well as quotes from both Pelicans and Spurs players about Williamson\u2019s beginning \u2026 * * * Williamson finished with 22 points and shot 8-for-11 overall, which works out to a 72.7% clip. In doing so, he joined a unique cast of characters who had 20 or more points and shot 70% or better in their first NBA game. Worth noting is that only one player on this list \u2014 Steve Smith \u2014 was a former Draft lottery pick like Williamson. Additionally, all five players (Smith, Gordan Giricek, Hot Rod Williams, Ron Anderson and Billy McKinney) were all traded at least twice in their NBA careers and only Smith was a former All-Star. In his first NBA game, the Pelicans were fairly conservative with Williamson\u2019s minutes. He had logged just under 12 minutes by the start of the fourth quarter ( 11 minutes, 41 seconds officially ) and logged another 6:37 in the fourth quarter to bring his total to 22 minutes. In doing so, he joined a slew of former rookies who also got a lot of work done in limited minutes \u2026 A smattering of quick-hitting things to know about Williamson\u2019s debut: A game as big as this one certainly had folks talking, whether it was Williamson\u2019s teammates or players and coaches from the Spurs. Here\u2019s a collection of some of the best comments about Zion\u2019s debut: * * * \u201cI wanted him to be aggressive, and I knew that he would make some mistakes, but you know I think what you saw there is a taste of once we really get settled in and he gets settled in, you can see that there\u2019s a lot of things we can do with him. There\u2019s a lot of potential there. It was good to see him do that, but you know I think there\u2019s a really really high ceiling that he can reach. So we\u2019ll just continue on, and we\u2019ll continue to practice.\u201d \u2014 Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry \u201cHis first official NBA game is against a pretty good team so, honestly I think the way he came out was very poised. The way he played, and even around us, and bringing energy especially down the stretch was something that, I guess you don\u2019t see from somebody so young. Even on top of that, we are almost in February and he hadn\u2019t played a game yet, so for him to be able to come out here and do that in his first game \u2026 is pretty elite.\u201d \u2014 Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even call it struggling. I mean, it was his first game. He told me before the game started he was going to ease his way into it. I told him to get a feel for it and then go from there. In the fourth, I think he was comfortable and they were sagging off of him so he was taking his shots.\u201d \u2014 Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball \u201cUp until that point, he had five points in the game. And we went to a zone and he made four 3s in a row. Before that, if you said, \u2018Who is going to shoot four 3s?\u2019 We would probably rather have him do that. They were scoring like crazy, and he did that and just innovated [sic] the crowd and they played really energetic the rest of the basketball game. They got fired up. \u2026 Before the 3s, he did a couple of things that were pretty cool. \u2026 I think as the game went on, he started to feel his feet a little bit and he started to be who everybody thinks he is.\u201d \u2014 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, on Williamson\u2019s fourth quarter \u201cHe\u2019s special. Anybody who has followed basketball the last two years and seen the talent he has\u2026 Hope he can stay healthy and be able to put it together. The sky is the limit for him.\u201d \u2014 Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan \u201cTo start the game, he wasn\u2019t going 100 miles an hour trying to get that first bucket and get that monkey off his back. He made the right plays and I think that\u2019s the biggest thing, especially for someone (his) age. With so many eyes on you, and so much pressure on you, it\u2019s easy to conform and whether we win or lose have your debut be successful. He went out there and made the right plays and played well defensively.\u201d \u2014 Pelicans guard Josh Hart \u201cI don\u2019t think I heard it. In those moments of the game I\u2019m more focused in on trying to knock the free throw down, which I didn\u2019t tonight.

Their hopes of turning things around, though, have been buoyed by having star center Karl-Anthony Towns back in the mix. Towns did his part against the Bulls, logging his eighth career 40-point game to try and spur a comeback. In the course of the evening, Timberwolves president of basketball operations Gersson Rosas told ESPN.com\u2019s Eric Woodyard that Towns remains the team\u2019s centerpiece despite any rumors to the contrary. \u201cKarl-Anthony Towns is as untouchable as they come,\u201d Rosas told ESPN . \u201cHe\u2019s the best player on our team and he\u2019s the guy we\u2019re building around. Everything we do is to help him become the best player and to help us become the best team we can be. He\u2019s a special talent that we\u2019re going to do anything possible to help him achieve his highest potential.\u201d The Timberwolves started out 10-8 after a Nov. 27 win against the San Antonio Spurs that had Minnesota as the No. 7 team in the West. From there, though, things went downhill for the Wolves. They would start an 11-game losing streak in their next game (on Dec. 1 against Memphis) and during that skid, Towns went out of the lineup. He did not play starting on Dec. 18 and would miss the next 15 games because of a sprained left knee. From Dec. 18 to Jan. 17, the Timberwolves went 5-10 and fell from a manageable No. 11 in the West to their current No. 13 spot. That lengthy absence was the first of Towns\u2019 career and he said Wednesday he is glad to be back on the court as he works himself back into his old form. \u201cI mean it\u2019s the first injury of my whole career from young until now. I feel good, I felt good the first day I came back against Indiana. I just feel like I had to get myself re-implemented back into the offense,\u201d Towns said Wednesday night. \u201cThere were so many things that changed and everything when I was out \u2014 I was just trying to find myself in the offense, and I think it was taken the wrong way when I said it. It was more saying that the plays were not meant for me anymore, it was different but the coaching staff did a great job and we talked it out and just trying to find ways.\u201d The Wolves have already made a trade this season, dealing guard Jeff Teague and swingman Treveon Graham to the Atlanta Hawks for Allen Crabbe on Jan. 16 . Rosas told ESPN he will continue to look for ways to improve Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very aggressive. We\u2019ve been very thorough in terms of any opportunities to help our team, and that\u2019ll be a continual process,\u201d Rosas told ESPN. \u201cSo for us, we\u2019re gonna be very active and we\u2019re going to look at any opportunity that can present itself and make sure that if there\u2019s a deal that we can do to improve our team, we\u2019re going to take advantage of those opportunities.\u201d Although Minnesota is clearly struggling, Towns is taking a long view on everything. \u201cI was having a conversation with someone the other day \u2026 fans think it\u2019s so easy to win in the NBA and it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Towns said, per ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult thing you can think of. No offense, this is not Life Time Fitness, this is not LA Fitness, this is the real thing. This is the best of the best playing, on one court, at one time, trying to figure out how to beat each other in a game of basketball. The margin of error is very slim. \u201cOne thing I always try and tell our guys is that, \u2018It\u2019s cool to go out there and do 98 great things and we come in here and we talk about all the 98 great things out of 100 that we did, but those two bad things are going to be the reason we lose.\u2019 The margin of error in the NBA is that slim and tonight was one of those nights.\u201d"},{"id":29254,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-makes-nba-debut","date":"2020-01-23","title":"Zion Williamson's 4th-quarter eruption delivers debut to meet the moment","content":" NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Red T-shirts emblazoned with white letters that said \u201cNOLA Won\u2019t Bow Down\u201d at least provided souvenirs for the sellout crowd of 18,365 commemorating the debut of rookie sensation Zion Williamson. For nearly 40 minutes, that seemed just about all that fans would be taking from this one. Williamson committed his fifth turnover with 10:42 left to play, having contributed just five points in 12 minutes over a pedestrian first three quarters. Then he zapped Smoothie King Arena with a magical 3 minutes and 8 seconds of brilliance Wednesday night, making everyone nearly forget the visiting San Antonio Spurs actually left the building as 121-117 victors . \u201cI think he made his point,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry quipped. Williamson also made good on all the hype surrounding him, the Pelicans, and the city of New Orleans over the last week. Most importantly, he walked away healthy after his first live action since fighting through an arduous rehabilitation process stemming from October arthroscopic knee surgery . Williamson reeled off 17 straight points in the fourth quarter, and per the Elias Stats Bureau, became the only player in history to shoot 4-of-4 from 3-point range in his NBA debut. Along the way, Williamson joined a select group of players that scored more points than they accumulated minutes on the floor (minimum 15 minutes played) in their NBA debuts. With 22 points in just 18 minutes on the floor, Williamson now finds himself in the company of players such as Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (then known as Chris Jackson) \u2014 who scored 26 points in 25 minutes back in 1990 with the Denver Nuggets, as well as Willie Burton (1990), Julius Erving (1976) and Johnny Neumann (1976). \u201cIt was everything I dreamed of except for the losing,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cJust the energy the crowd brought, the energy the city brought, it was electric. I\u2019m just grateful that they did that. It was a dream come true to finally get out there. But at the end of the day, I did want to win.\u201d Williamson\u2019s onslaught started with 8:52 remaining on a 27-foot 3-pointer off an assist from Lonzo Ball with the Pelicans trailing by eight points. Twenty-five ticks later, Ball tossed Williamson an alley-oop for a layup. Ball dished another dime for another Williamson 27-footer with 7:53 remaining. Thirty-one seconds later, Williamson scored on a putback layup after Jakob Poeltl initially blocked his shot. \u201cThe energy was there from warmups,\u201d Ball said later. \u201cThat is the most people I have seen coming out before the game even started. They were ready to go tonight and helped us get back into the game for sure.\u201d As Williamson dribbled the ball at the line for the first of two free throws, the sellout crowd whipped into a frenzy, screaming \u201cM-V-P, M-V-P, M-V-P!\u201d The moment surprised Williamson, who later said, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, that was different.\u201d Williamson attributed his long-range accuracy to all the time sidelined recovering from right knee surgery. \u201cI\u2019m gonna just say that when you\u2019re not able to move around and do athletic movements for a while, the only thing you do is just shoot spot-up jumpers,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI guess that was the result of that.\u201d The Pelicans entered the game wanting to limit Williamson\u2019s minutes by playing him short spurts. Williamson played 12 minutes over the first three quarters , hitting 2 of 3 from the floor and 1 of 2 from the free-throw line for five points with four turnovers. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich never expected the outburst that would come next. In the locker room at halftime, Gentry, Jrue Holiday and Darius Miller all pulled aside Williamson to encourage him to stop deferring and to just play his game. \u201cUp until that point, he had five points in the game,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAnd we went to a zone and he made four 3s in a row. Before that, if you said, \u2018Who is going to shoot four 3s?\u2019 We would probably rather have him do that. They were scoring like crazy, and he did that and just invigorated the crowd, and they really played energetic the rest of the basketball game. They got fired up.\u201d But Gentry, on orders from New Orleans\u2019 medical staff, would soon cool off Williamson by sitting him with 5:22 remaining. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the Smoothie King Center crowd started chanting again. \u201cWe want Zion! We want Zion! We want Zion!\u201d they screamed in vain trying to convince Gentry to re-insert the prized rookie with the Pelicans attempting to mount the late comeback. \u201cI understand where the fans are coming from, but we\u2019re also looking long term,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dual thing in my mind. Would I want him to be out on the court and would I want him to run to the scorer\u2019s table and check in? Yeah, but we\u2019ve got 35-plus games left. That\u2019s really what\u2019s important.\u201d Williamson admitted the difficulty in sitting during the waning moments. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, honestly,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI\u2019m 19, and in that moment, I\u2019m not thinking about longevity. I\u2019m thinking about winning that game, so it was very tough.\u201d Still, Williamson took the biggest step in his recovery Wednesday night by simply stepping on the court and playing a game for the first time since Oct. 13. With that finally out of the way, Williamson was asked if he can now return to some level of normalcy. For Williamson\u2019s debut, the Pelicans\u2019 public relations department issued a total of 160 media credentials. That number is closer to 30 or 40 on a normal night. So just as Williamson spoke, Holiday abruptly cut off the rookie. Looking over the crowd stuffed in a room down the hall from the locker room, Holiday said, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be normal for him. This is gonna be normal.\u201d Williamson looked over at Holiday and smiled. \u201cIt was nice to experience those emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was good to get back out there obviously, but I didn\u2019t have the outcome that I wanted.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Per the team, Powell is currently weighing his surgical options and updates will be provided as appropriate. Immediately after last night\u2019s game, the Mavericks didn\u2019t provide specifics about the severity of Powell\u2019s injury. He was slated to undergo and an MRI exam today and coach Rick Carlisle said after the game he feared Powell had a \u201csevere\u201d injury. \u201cBut we won\u2019t know for sure until the diagnostic test is done,\u201d Carlisle said Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s a real tough one.\u201d Coincidentally, Powell\u2019s injury came just as the Mavericks welcomed back another center in Kristaps Porzingis, who had missed the previous 10 games with right knee soreness. Powell went down with 2:57 remaining in the first quarter when his right leg gave out just two steps into an attempted drive to the basket. American Airlines Center went quiet as Powell writhed in pain on the floor, and eventually Mavericks athletic trainers helped the center to his feet and escorted him to the locker room. Minutes later, the team confirmed the injury and announced Powell would not return. Subsequent replays appeared to capture a noticeable pop in Powell \u2019 s right calf, often indicative of a ruptured Achilles. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the soldiers of the franchise really,\u201d Carlisle said.  \u201cBut he\u2019s an upbeat guy. And if the news ends up being the worst news, we\u2019ve seen how [J.J.] Barea recovered [from a right Achilles tear suffered last January]. So, Dwight will get back there. But we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll find out more tomorrow.\u201d The Mavericks are already considering potential options at center should Powell\u2019s injury force him out of action for an extended period. Dallas could elect to play third-year reserve Maxi Kleber at the position, or it could decide to play small with Porzingis at the 5. Kleber played nearly 32 minutes on Tuesday and contributed 8 points on 4-of-7 shooting with five rebounds and a pair of blocks. Porzingis finished with 10 points on 4-of-17 shooting in his first game since Dec. 29, and took responsibility for Tuesday\u2019s loss, which ended the team\u2019s winning streak at four games. Porzingis played a little more than 27 minutes as he works his way back into the mix after a long absence. \u201cI was eager to get back on the court. It just sucks that we weren\u2019t able to get a win,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cI think that if I played just a little bit better, we\u2019d have won the game. So, this loss is on me. That\u2019s how I feel. I just have to play better for my team, for my guys, for my coaches. I know it\u2019s my first game back and all that, but I always have high expectations for myself. I\u2019m just disappointed that I wasn\u2019t able to shoot the ball better. It just wasn\u2019t falling.\u201d Boban Marjanovic is another option. Marjanovic logged nearly 16 minutes against the Clippers, producing 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting with seven rebounds and two blocks. It\u2019s expected Carlisle will experiment with those options as the Mavericks embark on a three-game road trip starting Thursday at Portland and ending Monday at Oklahoma City. \u201cWe have to stick together and keep fighting, next man up,\u201d Carlisle said.  Powell, 28, has started in 37 games for the Mavericks this season, averaging 9.6 points and 5.7 rebounds. He\u2019s been particularly effective around the rim, shooting 79% in the restricted area for the fourth-best mark among players with at least 100 attempts from that spot. \u201cDwight has a really good mindset, a really strong mindset,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine throughout the rehab if we get the worst news.\u201d Powell joined the Mavericks in 2015 as part of a trade involving Rajon Rondo and quickly became a major component of the team\u2019s culture, which he has helped to advance after the retirement of future Hall of Fame Dirk Nowitzki. Porzingis mentioned that Powell, the team \u2019 s second-longest tenured player, has been \u201cgreat for the culture that we\u2019re trying to build,\u201d while Carlisle described him as \u201ca constant.\u201d \u201cHe is a constant team-first guy. He is a constant worker. He is a constant everything,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cGuys like him define the culture that we want here. It doesn\u2019t get much tougher than this if it ends up being what we fear it might, but he will be back regardless.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Plumlee has been diagnosed with a right cuboid injury, which will be re-evaluated in approximately 2-4 weeks. Denver\u2019s frontcourt was already hobbled as veteran forward Paul Millsap has been out for the last seven games with a left knee contusion. He will not play tonight against Houston Rockets ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and Plumlee\u2019s absence only further exacerbates the thinned depth along the front line. Aside from Millsap\u2019s injury, guard Gary Harris has missed the team\u2019s last four games with an adductor injury. Mike Singer of the Denver Post reports Plumlee suffered the injury in the first half of Monday\u2019s win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He rolled his right ankle in the second quarter of that game, but returned in the third quarter and finished with six points and four rebounds in 10 minutes of action. Overall this season, Plumlee is averaging 7.4 ppg, 5.6 rpg and 2.4 apg in 17.4 mpg as a key reserve. He has appeared in 42 games and is one of the better shot blockers and interior defenders on Denver\u2019s front line. The Nuggets are 30-13 and the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference, trailing the No. 2-seeded LA Clippers by just a 1\/2 game.

He was 88. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000 and was the first person who coached high school exclusively to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. He retired in 2002, but began his coaching career there in 1965. During that time, he won more than 1,200 games at the Washington, D.C.-area school and became the most successful high school coach in basketball history. He lead the school to the mythical national championship in 1962, \u201965, \u201968, \u201978 and \u201984 with his \u201965 team breaking the 71-game win streak Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ) and his Power Memorial team was in the midst of. Wooten notched more than 40 consecutive seasons with at least 20 wins and his teams won more than 30 conference championships. Additionally, DeMatha finished the season ranked No. 1 in the Washington, D.C. area more than 20 times. Wooten\u2019s teams were one of the first to play powerhouse teams from other states and used a full-court pressure defense that often led to offensive fouls. \u201cWe would step out and let somebody run over us, and they would call a foul and we would go down and shoot at the other end,\u201d Wootten told USA Today in 2013. \u201cThe rules committee came down from Massachusetts and started watching us play. That little innovation of stepping in front of a player, getting your feet planted and taking contact in the chest became eventually known as the offensive foul. We made them change the rule five times before they called it the offensive foul. At first, it was just a foul and we shot it. Later, they said that\u2019s delaying the game, so we\u2019ll wait five fouls before we go down. And then they went to the line for one. And finally they said we\u2019ll call it an offensive foul but we won\u2019t shoot it.\u201d Per USA Today , Wooten went 1,274-192 at DeMatha, ranking him second all-time behind Robert Hughes\u2019 1,333 victories. He also coached 13 future NBA players at DeMatha \u2014 most notably former Utah Jazz star and Hall of Famer Adrian Dantley . A dedicated educator, more than 150 of Wootten\u2019s former players went on to play college basketball. More than 20 of his former coaches or players coached at the high school, collegiate, or professional level."},{"id":29230,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwight-howard-dunk-contest","date":"2020-01-22","title":"Former dunk champ Dwight Howard will participate in AT&T Slam Dunk","content":" Superman is back in the building.

After more than 215 days, the New Orleans Pelicans and their fans will get a look at No. 1 pick Zion Williamson in a real-life, regular-season NBA game. The sports world at large (and the NBA world in particular) will be closely eyeing Spurs vs. Pelicans ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) to see what the explosive rookie can do. Lost in all this hype, perhaps, is the fact New Orleans is playing better of late as they\u2019re 11-5 since a putrid 6-22 start. As for the amount of playing time Williamson gets, it seems like all restrictions may be off (based on what lead exec David Griffin said back on Jan. 22 ). No matter what, this is one of the most exciting rookie debuts in recent memory and a must-watch moment. 2. Who will challenge Bucks in East? Milwaukee is running away with the No. 1 spot in the Eastern Conference (and the NBA at large). Yet there a handful of teams \u2014 the Toronto Raptors, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics at the forefront \u2014 who might pose a threat to the Bucks come playoff time. That pecking order is hardly decided, of course, and tonight\u2019s Sixers-Raptors game in Toronto ( 7 ET, ESPN ) should give the winner a measure of confidence in that department. Toronto is feeling good at the season\u2019s midpoint thanks to a healthy roster and improved play from Marc Gasol and Fred VanVleet. For the Sixers, Ben Simmons is on a tear: he\u2019s averaging 21.3 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.7 assists over his last 10 games . 3. Celtics flashing their might Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a banner one for Boston after it dominated the rival Los Angeles Lakers. Now comes the harder part for a team hoping to be a Finals contender: taking care of business against a young, scrappy team. That foe takes the form of the visiting Memphis Grizzlies ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), who saw their seven-game win streak end on MLK Day . The good news for Boston? Grizzlies star rookie Ja Morant is a little more tame vs. East foes (15.6 ppg, 7.9 apg, 3.1 rpg on 47.2% shooting). The bad news for Boston? Morant is rolling over his last eight games (18.9 ppg, 9.0 apg, 4.8 apg on 56.1% shooting). 4. Nuggets, Rockets set to tussle Denver is banged up, but keeps finding a way to win thanks to its superior depth. Such was the case in an MLK Day win in Minnesota , where Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley and others were a huge help. All of the above can\u2019t be said for Houston, which hosts the Nuggets ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and has hit a decided rough patch in 2019-20. Since beating the Nuggets on Dec. 31 , Houston is 3-5 and has lost four straight games . James Harden is in the midst of an awful stretch while the Rockets rank 22nd in rebound percentage (49.1%) and 20th in true shooting percentage (55.3%) in January. 5. On this date: Kobe\u2019s 81 Heading into Jan. 22, 2006, the 70-point margin had been crossed six times and just twice since 1963. That all changed when Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant rang up 81 points on 28-for-46 shooting (and 7-for-13 on 3-pointers) in a 122-104 comeback win against the Toronto Raptors. With his team trailing by 18 points in the third quarter, Bryant simply exploded, scoring 27 points in the third and 28 in the fourth. He accounted for all but 18 of the Lakers points in the second half and single-handedly put the game away."},{"id":29229,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/louis-vuitton-nba-new-partnership-deal","date":"2020-01-22","title":"Louis Vuitton to produce travel case for Larry O'Brien trophy","content":" Louis Vuitton and the National Basketball Association (NBA) today announced a multiyear partnership that makes the French fashion house the first official Trophy Travel Case provider of the NBA.

When you get tired of losing and watching the playoffs instead participating in them, you tend to lose your basketball innocence. Booker\u2019s first four NBA seasons have been spent developing the hardened shell he\u2019s showing these days. He\u2019s still a ruthless 3-point assassin and one of the truly elite scorers in the league. But he\u2019s much more than that in the system implemented by new coach Monty Williams and surrounded by veteran point guard Ricky Rubio, gritty two-way wing Kelly Oubre Jr. and big man Deandre Ayton, who is finally settling in after serving a 25-game suspension by testing positive for a diuretic. Booker is the leader of a Suns team in the thick of the chase for the Western Conference\u2019s No. 8 spot . The Memphis Grizzlies have that perch and a two-game lead on the Suns, with the San Antonio Spurs and Portland Trail Blazers both ahead of Phoenix. \u201cWe\u2019re just about trying to win games at this point of the season,\u201d said Booker, who has scored 30 or more points in 10 of his last 13 games. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters right now.\u201d As noted in the latest NBA.com Power Rankings , the Suns are one victory away from being the first team to match its 2018-19 win total . With the league\u2019s toughest remaining schedule (cumulative opponent winning percentage: 53.9%), there is no time to waste. Booker feels that sense of urgency deep in his bones. And he\u2019s showing it every night out, win or lose. Booker smoked the Celtics for 39 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in Saturday\u2019s win in Boston and followed it up with 37 points, seven rebounds and five assists in Monday\u2019s loss to San Antonio. So the Indiana Pacers should expect to see nuclear Booker tonight ( 9 ET, League Pass ). Because there will be no easing up the rest of the way. Booker spoke at length with NBA.com about all that and more. (Editor\u2019s Note: Portions of this conversation have been condensed and edited). * * * NBA.com :  I know you\u2019ve always put the work in on your game, but what changed for you this season? It is just a matter of having Monty Williams running the show and having a point guard like Ricky Rubio to facilitate for everybody? Devin Booker: Yeah, for sure. It\u2019s a whole different situation. A new culture, new foundation and new players and a whole new coaching staff. The first thing Monty stressed, the thing he stresses all the time, is the culture, having a good gym and guys that work hard. So everybody has bought into that and it\u2019s shown positive gains for us so far. Even through our droughts, the gym is still good, our chemistry is still good. And that keeps you motivated every day to come in here and go to work for Coach Monty and his coaching staff grinding to get back on track. I know guys in this league love to hit the gym in the offseason to work on their game; I saw you in a video or two. But did you get off the radar a bit and work on specific parts of your game? I did a couple of open gyms, but yeah, more importantly for me, which is why I wasn\u2019t on the USA Team that went to China , was taking care of my body. The past two seasons I missed a total of 50 games, and they were little injuries \u2014 hamstrings and stuff like that. I knew if I took my body more seriously and put the work in there, I\u2019d be able to stay on the court more. So I locked in and worked on my body, focused on that and stayed in the gym with my pops [former NBA and international player Melvin Booker ] and it\u2019s been paying off. When you say working on your body, are you talking about changing your diet as well? I\u2019m not sure of the right phrase is to describe it, but you look tighter this season compared to last season. Yeah, I\u2019ve had my chef for two years now. And it\u2019s an everyday grind now, how much work you put in on the court and it\u2019s how you have to take care of your body also. Once I figured that out, there\u2019s a smarter way to play and prepare yourself to play, it feels good and it\u2019s how you withstand the rigor of the 82 games. You missed China and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics are looming. Are you looking to get back into USA Basketball for Tokyo 2020? I mean, that\u2019s the plan. I would love to. I just have to focus on this right now, try and lead this team to the playoffs. Whatever comes after that we\u2019ll see. But it would be a blessing for sure. You know, I\u2019ve watched it since I was a kid. I think it\u2019s the most prestigious basketball you can find in the world. And I\u2019d love to be a part of it.  When you look at this team, what has to happen to get to the playoffs? How do the Suns get there? Being a game or two out right now, it\u2019s that time before All-Star break when you have to start your run before teams come back after All-Star break with a new roster or a new focus. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that you do your work early during this stretch right here. Things like this East Coast road trip are so crucial. You absolutely have to lock in night after night and develop tunnel vision on the goal. You hear it all the time but when you\u2019re fighting to make the playoffs, you live it. So where are you now, in terms of your game and where you feel most effective? For years you were seen by most people as a shooter. It feels like you\u2019ve had more dunks in the first half of this season than in all your years prior. Is that just the grimy Devin Booker coming out of you? [Laughing] I\u2019m just trying to switch it up man. You gotta just take what the defense gives you. And that\u2019s what I do out there. I\u2019ve probably seen every defense they can throw at you, so it\u2019s take what the defense gives you. Some nights teams try to take me out totally and I feel like I have a supporting cast around me in Kelly, Ricky, Deandre and a lot of guys who have helped take that pressure off of me. But if teams leave a guy on an island, I feel like I can go to work. Is that something that only happens after a few years in the league: the recognition of when you can lock in and go to work on a specific defender or defensive scheme designed against you? Yeah, as I said, I\u2019ve pretty much seen it all as far as the past four years, that I\u2019m comfortable with it now. I can figure out quickly what kind of coverage the defense is using that night. And I try and exploit it every chance I get. Does it seem like it\u2019s gone by in a blur? One day you\u2019re a McDonald\u2019s All-American \u2026 and then you wake up and you\u2019re an NBA veteran. When you go back to where you started, what\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve taken from those early years that\u2019s been the most important factor in your growth? I think you just have to have tunnel vision, man. There\u2019s so much and so many other things going on \u2014 whether it\u2019s off the court or on the court, it\u2019s a trade or other things that are really out of your control, something in the media \u2014 you can easily lose track of what your goals are and what you are really here for. And you think back to that time when you were a kid and all you really wanted to do was be in the NBA, and you get reminded why you are here and focus on that above all that other stuff, all the other distractions that might be out there. Just keep working hard and get better everyday. Be the best version of yourself and kind of just block out the outside noise and let that stuff go. Is that clock ticking in your head as well of that idea that \u201cdamn, I want to play beyond mid-April \u2026 I want to be in the playoffs with my guys?\u201d Awww yeah, I feel like my game is made for that, that my talent level is ready for that. And I think it has been for a couple of years. And like you just said, I put the work in, too. So it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been grinding for it. Hard work isn\u2019t foreign to me. I\u2019ve been watching the playoffs all my life and obviously it\u2019s a different type of basketball \u2026 and that\u2019s something I want to be a part of. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

So many years after what had been one of the NBA\u2019s most panicked, unexpected and challenging episodes, there was some measure of order restored forever with Johnson on stage at Radio City Music Hall, eulogizing the league\u2019s most powerful and accomplished commissioner ever.  Rather than the other way around, a real possibility and the presumption of many when they heard the stunning news in November 1991 that Johnson had contracted the HIV virus. \u201cAt a time of need 29 years ago, my commissioner turned into my angel,\u201d Johnson said at what was billed as a celebration of Stern\u2019s life. Johnson was just 32 years old then and Stern 49 in his eighth year as the NBA\u2019s chief executive. As he spoke to an audience that filled most of the famous auditorium\u2019s 3,500 seats on the main floor, Johnson did so at the robust age of 60. No one would have been happier about the chronology than Stern, who died Jan. 1 at age 77 after suffering a brain hemorrhage three weeks earlier. Stern had rushed to Los Angeles to be with Johnson at the news conference in which the Lakers\u2019 MVP and championship point guard went public. It was a moment so searing that many people still recall where they were when they saw it. Stern\u2019s unflagging support of Johnson and his determination to educate fans (and other NBA players) about HIV, AIDS and the transmission of such diseases led the commissioner to invite Johnson \u2013 who abruptly retired upon learning of his diagnosis \u2013 to return for the 1992 All-Star Game in Orlando. After Johnson starred in a joyous, MVP performance, Stern famously and immediately hugged him, a demonstration that such contact was not to be feared. \u201cThat game saved my life,\u201d said Johnson, later tearing up. \u201cIt gave me the energy I needed to carry on. \u2026 I\u2019m gonna miss my angel.\u201d Missing Stern has been a state of mind and a sad distraction for so many in the NBA community this month. The event Tuesday was a shared opportunity to spin it backward and forward at the same time, enjoying memories of Stern while appreciating his work and the lessons that will endure as the league marches on. The setting was terrific. Radio City Music Hall sits on Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st street. That\u2019s just one long block, current commissioner Adam Silver noted, from Stern\u2019s former office at the NBA headquarters building on Fifth Avenue. The Art Deco auditorium is grand and big enough to hold all who came. The great proscenium arch rising 60 feet above the stage and Tuesday\u2019s speakers is shaped as a gaping semi-circle, bathed in orange light \u2014 which made it look like a tremendous basketball, the perfect backdrop for the day. Fitting, too, since Stern\u2019s tenure as commissioner and his impact figure to have more legs than the Rockettes who more traditionally work this room. The stage and arch actually were designed to resemble a setting sun, also appropriate. The tributes to and remembrances of Stern that came in the immediate wake of his death rightfully focused on his career, the heavy lifting he did in taking the NBA from a struggling, third-rate league whose championship games couldn\u2019t crack prime time to the global sports juggernaut it is today. Much of it, he had accomplished before he stepped down in February 2014, exactly 30 years after he ascended to the commissioner position. So news accounts of his passing included talk of his personality, generally focused on his tough and sometimes intimidating business style. While often not user-friendly, it served the NBA and its players well. \u201cHow many millionaires did that man help create?\u201d Larry Bird wondered in a conversation with NBA.com. \u201cWith all the things he did for this league, a bunch of basketball players got really, really rich.\u201d What attendees heard Tuesday, though, filled in the cracks and revealed facets of Stern\u2019s life and ways about which most basketball fans \u2014 and many in attendance \u2014 knew little or nothing. We learned that he had a middle-school\u2019s love of juvenile and bawdy jokes. That he drove a 1977 Buick station wagon with wood-grain paneling long past its useful life. And that Stern and his wife Dianne, in the personal story shared by Golden State team president Rick Welts, made a considerable donation in the memory of Welts\u2019 partner Arnie Chinn when Chinn died in 1994. It would be several years before Welts, a Stern prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the NBA hierarchy at the time, would come out as gay, and the Warriors executive says he still doesn\u2019t know how his boss learned of his loss. Greeted in the great hall by a jazz quartet from nearby Lincoln Center, where Stern sat on the board, and played out into the afternoon by a Mardi Gras-style brass band, the guests cut across decades, generations and all levels of luminosity of NBA life. There were more Hall of Famers in the room than typically show up on Enshrinement Night each year in Springfield, Mass., on hand to pay respect to the man who helped keep their marvelous engine running. Among the many: Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dikembe Mutombo, Bill Walton, Wayne Embry, Yao Ming, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, and Jason Kidd. There were plenty of others, some recently retired, some in Stern\u2019s orbit in roles other than players. Elton Brand, Rod Stickland, Dallas owner Mark Cuban, agent David Falk \u2014 frankly, random players, head coaches, GMs and\/or executives from the league\u2019s 30 franchises. The Knicks and the Lakers, who play Wednesday at Madison Square Garden, skipped practice to attend. There were little shots mingling with bigs, and folks from Stern\u2019s assorted realms of law, commerce, broadcasting, media and marketing.  Reflections were offered by Silver, Johnson and Welts, along with jazz artist Wynton Marsalis, former WNBA executive Val Ackerman, friend Michael Cardozo, NBA president of social responsibility Kathy Behrens and Miami Heat president Pat Riley. Stern\u2019s two sons Eric and Andrew also spoke. Here are a few of the highlights: * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The path back to the court hasn\u2019t been easy for the No. 1 overall pick of the 2019 Draft, but he\u2019s ready, at last, to play. \u201cThe rehab workouts are long and strenuous,\u201d Williamson said Tuesday. \u201cThere were a lot of times where I wanted to punch a wall or kick a chair. It\u2019s frustrating to not be able to move your body the way you want to, especially since I\u2019m 19. It\u2019s been tough, but I battled through.\u201d Williamson\u2019s regular-season debut was expected to be one of 2019-20\u2019s marquee events, but it was delayed several months due to Oct. 21 surgery on his right knee . Last week, New Orleans Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin told reporters that Williamson was set to debut against the Spurs. That long-awaited debut is a welcome sight for Williamson. \u201cI know the people of New Orleans are going to show a lot of love because that\u2019s what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the outside people, all I can do is invite the love. If they want to bring it, then bring it. \u201cIt\u2019s been great. The city is beautiful, the people are beautiful as well. They\u2019ve welcomed me. It felt like they\u2019ve adopted me a little bit. They show love everywhere I go and just tell me they can\u2019t wait for me to get back out there.\u201d Williamson returned to full-court, five-on-five work in practice with the Pelicans on Jan. 7 . But coach Alvin Gentry and the organization took a non-committal stance about when Williamson would join his teammates on the floor in games. \u201cI think it might be a little different magnitude to this one. This is my first NBA game \u2026 this is business now. This is different,\u201d Williamson said of his debut Tuesday. He told reporters he expects a learning curve on the court, but hopes to fit into what the Pelicans have working of late as well. New Orleans has gone 11-5 since a 6-22 start, putting it within striking distance of a West playoff spot as Williamson\u2019s debut nears. When asked what his role will be for the Pelicans, Williamson simply smiled and said he\u2019s spoken with the coaches and that it is to \u201cgo out there and help the team win.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be coming back at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did go through a bad stretch but things are turning around. Everybody\u2019s been playing better and I\u2019m just looking to go join in on the fun. \u201cIt\u2019s just basketball. This is what I do. I\u2019ve been doing it since I was four. \u2026 It\u2019s one game at a time and that\u2019s what\u2019s been working for us.\u201d Williamson, 19, hasn\u2019t played in a game since an Oct. 13 exhibition victory over the San Antonio Spurs, in which he racked up 22 points to go with 10 rebounds . Williamson said he first started to feel pain in his right knee after New Orleans\u2019 123-114 win in San Antonio. A subsequent MRI exam revealed damage to the meniscus in Williamson\u2019s right knee, and the rookie underwent surgery on Oct. 21, a day before the team\u2019s season-opening road loss to the Toronto Raptors. The team initially pointed to a six-to-eight week time frame for Williamson\u2019s recovery, but it also took a long-term view toward the rookie\u2019s rehabilitation process, before deciding ultimately to bring him along at a slower pace, given his importance to the franchise. The No. 1 overall pick in last year\u2019s Draft , Williamson scored the most points in the preseason by a rookie in the last three seasons when he hit on 12-of-13 shots for 29 points in a Pelicans comeback win over the Chicago Bulls. Williamson averaged 23.3 points per game in four preseason outings while shooting 71.4% and pulling down 6.5 rebounds. Information from The Associated Press and NBA.com\u2019s Michael C.

As Wildcat coach John Calipari does with all his players, regardless of whether they\u2019re future NBA Draft picks, he\u2019s been tough on Maxey, urging him to value every possession, make the right decision and strive for consistency. But on the practice floor is where Maxey has elevated his skill level, jousting every day with sophomore guards Ashton Hagans, an elite defender, and Immanuel Quickley, one of the hottest shooters in Division I basketball the last couple of weeks. \u201cHaving to play against Ashton Hagans one day, and then Immanuel Quickley the next, has been huge for him,\u201d says Kentucky assistant Joel Justus. \u201cBoth are different covers. You play against a pit bull [Hagans] one day who just comes right after you and gets you trying to play faster and out of your comfort zone. And then the next day, you\u2019re going against a craftier, taller, longer, trickier guy [Quickley], where you have to play cerebral and you\u2019ve got to your speed, whereas the other guy, you can\u2019t use your speed. You\u2019ve got to try and outwit him.\u201d Maxey, a consensus Top 10 recruit in the class of 2019, was prepared for what he\u2019d face at Kentucky, having been taught the game\u2019s finer points by his father Tyrone, who played at Washington State. At South Garland High School in Texas, the combo guard was rated a five-star prospect, a McDonald\u2019s All-American and Texas Mr. Basketball. Maxey wasted no time living up to those accolades. In his first game at Kentucky, against Michigan State, he scored 27 points in a Wildcat victory over the consensus preseason No. 1 team. As the season has progressed, Maxey has continued to thrive in the spotlight, stepping forward with his biggest games against the Wildcats\u2019 toughest opponents. He scored a season-high 27 in a win over rival Louisville, knocking down 4-for-5 3-pointers to prove a facet of his game some perceive as a weakness can be a weapon.  Maxey\u2019s overall performance in a win at Georgia \u2014 17 points, seven rebounds, eight assists, four blocks and a steal \u2014 were key as Kentucky came away with a win in a hostile environment. He made a couple of 3s in that game, and if he continues to gain consistency from behind the arc (30.3% 20-for-66), he\u2019ll be hard to contain. He can score at the rim and in the midrange, a deadly floater sometimes transforming into a crafty lob pass and dunk for a rim-running big man. \u201cHere\u2019s a kid who has a little bit of it all and can do it on a big scale,\u201d says Kentucky associate head coach Kenny Payne. \u201cSo he\u2019s dangerous. But Kentucky will never see the best of it. This is just the foundation.\u201d Maxey is a combo guard in the truest sense of the term. Payne wouldn\u2019t classify him as a shooter or a slasher, just a scorer. And his all-around game \u2014 as a facilitator, defender and even a rebounder \u2014 is beginning to convince NBA scouts and Draft analysts of his value. \u201cForget the scoring,\u201d Payne says. \u201cLook what he did at Georgia. Eight assists, seven rebounds, four blocks. That translates to the NBA. Our big thing with him is, everybody thinks scoring is the indicator of a professional or being a great player. A lot of the kids that have come through here have filled up the stat sheet. They get seven or eight rebounds, four of five assists and three or four steals, maybe block a shot from the guard position. All that translates.\u201d This isn\u2019t to diminish Maxey\u2019s great potential as a scorer. The Kentucky staff has been urging him to improve at catching and shooting, because if he does and defenders respect it too much, he\u2019s off to the rim, where he can score or find an open teammate. \u201cThe thing he can really become elite at is his catch-and-shoot game,\u201d Justus says. \u201cLike a lot of high school kids, he was used to catching the ball and figuring out what he\u2019s going to do next. He\u2019s getting better and better. Cal is continuing to force him to play faster and be more decisive when he gets the ball.\u201d Payne laughs when he talks about Maxey\u2019s toughness. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to ride him so hard, but we do,\u201d Payne says. \u201cCoach Cal pushes him every day in practice. How are you going to handle adversity? We want results. We want affirmation. A lot of this is new to him, and it\u2019s coming at him fast. We\u2019re asking him to figure it out on the fly. That\u2019s what pros do.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

That\u2019s not debatable anymore. You don\u2019t do the things the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 second-year point guard does on a regular basis and get excluded from that list. Young is already a fan favorite and a near-daily viral sensation because of his highlight-worthy skills and penchant for showing out on the competition. He will be an Eastern Conference All-Star in roughly 10 days, and deservedly so. But is he a legitimate Kia MVP candidate in a season when the players populating the latest Kia MVP list all toil for teams sitting pretty in the Eastern and Western Conference standings? Young\u2019s Hawks, at 10-34, have \u2014 to put it kindly \u2014 struggled this season , which casts a bit of a shadow on his brilliant individual season. Young and his Draft classmate, Dallas guard Luka Doncic , are the only players in the league who rank in the top five in points and assists this season. Doncic is in the top five on the MVP Ladder while Young flirted with a spot in the opening weeks of the season, before injuries and a suspension to John Collins torpedoed things. He hasn\u2019t clawed his way back into the mix since. Doncic\u2019s Mavs are also fifth in the Western Conference while Young\u2019s Hawks are least in the East. Young\u2019s fans want him to be judged the same way Luka is, which would require any non-partial observer to ignore the obvious. If we\u2019re evaluating the league\u2019s best players and using any sort of reasonable criteria for separating them, how can we credit everyone else making their contributions in winning situations and then ignore that component for one player? It\u2019s not even about penalizing Young for the Hawks\u2019 struggles, because we all know this kind of season isn\u2019t on one player. But it would be disingenuous, at best, to credit him for impressive numbers without any contextual impact on winning. That, after all, is what separates the best of the very best in the Kia MVP chase. * * * Fear The Deer: The Milwaukee Bucks don\u2019t care if you are tired of their routine. They\u2019re sticking to their win-them-all-all-the-damn-time mantra. Just in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, the Bucks have won seven straight games and are 12-1 since that Christmas Day humbling at the hands of the Philadelphia 76ers. Giannis Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t grinding on his own, he\u2019s riding with an entire group bent on chasing the No. 1 overall seed for a second straight season. Torn over Zion\u2019s debut: Is it possible to be absolutely giddy and simultaneously mortified about Zion Williamson making his regular season debut Wednesday? Strangely, that\u2019s been the mood here at Headquarters in the lead up to Spurs-Pelicans ( 9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). After Christmas, the idea of Zion sitting out the entire season didn\u2019t irritate me as much as it did weeks ago. Not with Ja Morant and other members of his rookie class holding it down the way they have been this season. The Pelicans are recently improved (11-5 in their last 16 games after a 13-game skid before that) and any disruption to their flow, even from a talent as dynamic as the No. 1 overall pick, could mess with the mojo. But maybe this is the right time to integrate Zion into the mix. We know he\u2019s anxious to finally get out there. But any setbacks, even a slight one, will fuel panic attacks from Bourbon Street to the bayou and beyond. All I need is for Zion to stay injury-free for the rest of whatever he can salvage from his delayed rookie season. Whatever he does above and beyond that is just fine. Player(s) of the Week: Joel Embiid\u2019s absence has allowed us to see a much more assertive Ben Simmons, who earned Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors for his work. And who says load management would hold Kawhi Leonard back? The Clippers star claimed the honor in the West, reminding us all that the reigning Finals MVP remains one of the game\u2019s most dangerous players. Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . From: Timothy Foster Jan. 15, 2020 | 11:20 a.m. At this point in the season, LeBron should be leading the MVP race, with Giannis a close second. I created my own analytic system that values players on how well they play their position. It tends to take a more old-school approach to the numbers. In an era where players like Giannis are doing it all, he\u2019s, unfortunately, punished a little bit for dominating his team\u2019s scoring instead of creating more opportunities for others. Still, by the Lakers moving LeBron to the PG position, he\u2019s done a fantastic job of creating those scoring opportunities for others (Anthony Davis) while also maintaining a high level of scoring output for himself. He still turns the ball over a little too much, but that\u2019s expected for someone who is dictating the offense so much. Finally, he\u2019s doing a great job of drawing fouls without committing them so package that all together and he\u2019s a leader at his position who\u2019s elevating his team to another level (the fact that he\u2019s the best player on the second-best team in the NBA helps). Through this same system, Giannis wouldn\u2019t be too far behind. And even though he\u2019s the best player on the best team in the NBA, he gets knocked a little bit because he\u2019s committing so many fouls and he\u2019s turning the ball over a little too much for his position. If Giannis can tighten up those aspects of his game, he\u2019ll pass LeBron in my book. My top 5 (only following this metric) would be: 1. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers 2. Giannis Atentokuompo, Milwaukee Bucks 3. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks 4. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers 5. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers * * * My response: Timothy, I\u2019m going to respectfully disagree with your notion that Giannis doesn\u2019t create as much as he could or should for the rest of the Bucks. Everything they do is predicated on the power of Giannis being able to draw attention and open the floor for the rest of the team, whoever he he plays on the floor. Of all of the things people use to nit-pick his game, that might be the most misunderstood aspects of what it means to have a player of that ilk as the epicenter of everything a team does. It\u2019s Luka\u2019s world \u2026 right? From: Ritvik Chintha Jan. 15, 2020 | 11:06 a.m. What\u2019s up, baby? It\u2019s me again! How do you do! You didn\u2019t feature me on the MVP mailbag! My opinion is very important and good and my feelings are hurt! Why is Harden even in the race? All he does is draw fouls. Anthony Davis always gets injured. Lebron\u2019s old. Giannis chokes in the playoffs. Luka should win this time and you know it. * * * My response: Let me be clear \u2014 bruised feeling are never the intended result here. A healthy dialogue about our collective favorite game (the NBA) is the main focus. I apologize for missing your previous missive. As for your question (forgive me, but it seemed rhetorical), James Harden is in this race because he\u2019s scoring at a historic clip, and has been on that sort of ride for a while now. He does draw a ridiculous amount of fouls, but I cannot hold it against him just because he\u2019s found a way to the rules work for him. And finally, Luka is in the mix. We\u2019ll see where he finishes. From: Rikki D Jan. 15, 2020 | 9:22 a.m. First, I would like to thank you for continuing to bring us this beautiful concoction that we refer to as the MVP Ladder every week for as long as you have. Having followed you for years, I have never written to you because \u2026 well, I don\u2019t write. See, I am a Mavericks fan and somehow we don\u2019t do things like that, where we plead for our best players to be hoisted to the top of lists and forego all logic as we surrender to our biases. I wish we acted more like James Harden fans, who can whole-heartedly claim that he is the best player since Michael Jordan. I wish we could be as adamant as LeBron James fans, who think he should have won every MVP award except the last. Somehow, we were never taught that. I am here simply to make a humble request: please don\u2019t punish Luka Doncic because a large contingent of his fans are like me \u2014 ones who never learned how to show dogmatic fanaticism to try and convince NBA pundits to change their lists. Now, I know that you will not be swayed by some of these ridiculous emails that come your way but I also understand that even someone as supremely talented and breathtakingly good-looking as yourself are still mortal and might get rattled into a bad decision. In those moments of weakness, please remember people like me, who, behind the aforementioned raucous crowd, have formed a silent army and simply show up and read every article, mailbag, or list that you publish expecting you to have done it justice. We don\u2019t complain, we don\u2019t get bitter, and we definitely don\u2019t call you names. We respect the platform too much and don\u2019t think of our own opinions so highly. I think Dirk trained us too well. * * * My response: Rikki D with the email of the year! I appreciate your approach. You don\u2019t have to lobby for your guy when he\u2019s doing the work he is doing this season. Luka has earned his spot on this list, like everyone else. Where he finishes ultimately will be based on his overall performance, not some persuasive argument made on his behalf by anyone. I wouldn\u2019t fall for that and most folks who understand how this process works understands that a player\u2019s body of work is his case and not some passionate campaign from hi supporters. The legend proves true From:  Damon Smith Jan. 17, 2020 | 2 p.m. \u201cWhat these young bloods have to understand is that this game has always been, and will always be, about buckets.\u201d \u2013 Bill Russell to Uncle Drew in that old Pepsi commercial .  Sekou, winning basketball is defined by outscoring the opponent, and that depends on maximizing AND optimizing a team\u2019s possessions. Simply put, there are only two ways to score more points in a game: (1) score more points per possession, and (2) create extra possessions. True Shooting percentage (TS%) is a good indicator of the first measure, since it takes into account the value differentials associated with a successful scoring possession. For your readers, the basic concept is that a 3-pointer is 50% more valuable than a 2-pointer, even as both attempts \u201ccost\u201d the team exactly one possession. As such, TS% can be used to represent overall shooting efficiency by combining a team\u2019s FG%, 3PT FG% and FT% into a single metric. The formula for calculating TS% is: TS% = PTS\/(2x(FGA+0.44*FTA)) The .44 multiplier is because not all FTAs take up a possession. Technical foul shots and \u2018And-Ones\u2019 do not, while there are more than two free throws on one possession with a three-shot foul. About 44% of all free throws take up possessions, so .44 is used as the multiplier. I invented a new metric called Scoring Contribution percentage (SC%), which is simply TS% adjusted for extra possessions created by offensive rebounds, steals and blocked shots and for posses-sions lost from turnovers. The formula for calculating SC% is: SC% = PTS\/(2*(FGA+0.44*FTA)-OREB-STL-(0.57*BLK)+TOV) The .57 multiplier is applied to blocked shots because 57% of blocks result in a change of possession. I re-ranked your Kia MVP Ladder for January 17 based on Scoring Contribution % and the surprise winner (by a lot) is \u2026 Rudy Gobert! He\u2019s scoring 15 ppg on a ridiculously efficient 8.6 FGAs. He leads the group in OREBs and is second in BLKs, and he has the fewest TOVs. Here are the complete ranking by SC% with your current Kia MVP Ladder ranking in parenthesis. R. Gobert (8) | 80.8% A. Davis (6) | 64.6% G. Antetokounmpo (1) | 62.5% J. Harden (5) | 61.4% J. Butler (4) | 61.0% N. Jokic (9) | 60.7% C. Paul (10) | 59.2% K. Leonard (7) | 57.5% L. Doncic (3) | 57.4% L. James (2) | 56.0% Of course, assists and defense still matter, and there\u2019s admittedly some bias to forwards versus guards since they generally take higher percentage shots, get more OREBs and BLKs, and create fewer TOVs, but I still think it\u2019s an interesting lens. Anyway, this is all just for fun. We all know the real MVP is: Luka Magic! Go Mavs! * * * My response: I\u2019ll have to check with my elders to make sure it\u2019s cool, but you\u2019re being adopted into my wing of the Smith family after this e-mail, Damon. We don\u2019t have anyone else in the family with the math skills you\u2019ve displayed. It\u2019s a fascinating look at a metric that basically emphasizes we\u2019re on the right track on the Ladder. That\u2019s always a good thing. Welcome to the family! So much LeBron love From:  Shane Scully Jan. 17, 2020 | 2 p.m. It really baffles me why LeBron gets so much love in the MVP conversation. The fact that he has Davis and that the Lakers seem to play sub-.500 teams every other night should go against him. Kevin Durant got no love for MVP when playing in Golden State and he was playing at an elite level on both sides of the ball. The same can\u2019t be said for LBJ this season. Assisting is overrated \u2014 there are always a couple guys each year averaging 10 or more assists per game. How many guys average 40 ppg while for the most part winning games? Also that Lakers team is stacked. They\u2019re not Golden State-in-its-prime stacked, but it is definitely loaded. There are four past or current All-Stars (James, Davis, Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard), plus a poor man\u2019s Klay Thompson (Danny Green) and legit NBA talent (Quinn Cook, Avery Bradley, JaVale McGee, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma). The media bias is something else this season. * * * My response: I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re baffled, Shane. LeBron\u2019s being doing his thing for years and being celebrated and shredded every step of the way. I don\u2019t see this media bias in his favor that you speak of. Not for a player who has stacked up the accomplishments the way LeBron has throughout his career. He\u2019s in the same predicament as everyone else on the Ladder. It\u2019s like Janet Jackson sang once, \u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d Ask Lakers fans who have been clamoring for a winner since Kobe Bryant\u2019s championship heyday if LeBron\u2019s impact is legit or just a product of media hype. From:  Christopher Marlton Jan. 20, 2020 | 12:23 a.m. I was wondering, based on how this season is progressing, how Westbrook is getting absolutely zero press for how his season has been so far. After coming off a knee surgery which obviously hampered his first month, he\u2019s been averaging insane numbers and shooting at an excellent percentage. When the Rockets played the Clippers on Dec. 19 \u2014 with Leonard, George and Harden all on the court \u2014 it was clear who the most dominant player in the game was. When the Rockets lost to the Lakers recently , despite the Houston role-players poor shooting and Lakers\u2019 successful disruption tactics \u2014 flopping, Dwight eliminating Tucker with a screen, kicking the ball, etc \u2014 it was clear out of LeBron, Harden and Russ that the most dominant player on the court was Westbrook. How does this get ignored? My dad hadn\u2019t watch many games this season, but had read a lot of articles and media and was dumbfounded when watching the game that, to quote him, \u201ceveryone was saying Westbrook has gotten worse or isn\u2019t the player he used to be \u2026 but he\u2019s dominating.\u201d His January numbers \u2014 30.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 8.3 apg, 53.6% shooting \u2014 are as good as anyone in the league, right? Or am I missing something? I\u2019m not saying he should be MVP. But to not even be mentioned in the conversation at any point, is kind of bizarre when he outshines other MVP candidates in head-to-head games. * * * My response: You make a great point, Chris. The lack of love for Russell Westbrook\u2019s contributions in Houston this season have not garnered the sort of attention they would if it was someone else. I think we in the media need to own that one. Russ put up such crazy numbers in his final three seasons in Oklahoma City that I feel like he desensitized us to what has become the norm for him. I know, it sounds like an excuse \u2026 but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s my opinion about what was once a regularly debated topic among my media brethren. But you are right, we need to check ourselves on this one. And what about Towns and Ingram \u2026? From:  Declan Thornton Jan. 18, 2020 | 2:05 p.m. Where is Karl Anthony Towns on the Ladder? He should beat out guys like Jokic, Gobert and Sabonis. Also, should Brandon Ingram be in the mix as well? * * * My response: Towns just came back from a long absence, Declan, so I\u2019d give it some time before stumping for him to dive back into the MVP mix. Ingram has been outstanding and certainly deserves a second look. We\u2019ll see what he does with Zion Williamson added to the mix. But he\u2019s definitely played his way into the radar. From:  Zach Jan. 17, 2020 | 11:55 p.m. I would like to discuss how you are treating my boy, James Harden, who is \u2014 I\u2019m gonna say it \u2014 the best offensive player ever. The numbers speak for themselves. * * * My response: Well, Zach, I\u2019m going to pass on any argument made for Harden as the best offensive player ever. He is still in the midst of an absolutely crazy run and is not done yet. But I am not going to ignore the fact that as good as he is on one end of the floor, he\u2019s woefully deficient on the other \u2014 particularly when you put it in the context of a MVP chase that includes so many other proficient two-way guys. From: Ned Einstein Jan. 17, 2020 | 4:46 p.m. Giannis, Harden and Davis are clearly the most unstoppable, and Harden, Paul and Luka are the best at maintaining their dribble (which is very overlooked today). But Luka is the only terrific player on a team with no other even excellent-level players on it (Porzingis and Hardaway, Jr. are good players on some nights). So Luka is clearly the MVP. But it\u2019s important to note that this is not the best player. Only the most-valuable. Insofar as skill at his age, Luka is like Magic Johnson with more offense and a better basic defensive player, too. He\u2019s not yet the passer Magic was, but he\u2019s a better ball-handler in traffic and can keep his dribble to weave into the paint better. (He doesn\u2019t have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or James Worthy to pass off to, or Jamaal Wilkes at Magic\u2019s early stages.) Magic was a bit stronger; Luka shows the pain of getting knocked around a lot. But two years in the Euroleague are more valuable training than two years of college in the U.S. Luka is quicker, but Magic was faster. There are lots of interesting comparisons. * * * My response: Ned, I have to admit I\u2019ve never exchanged words with an Einstein. That said, I\u2019m pushing back on any Luka-Magic comparisons given what we saw from Magic as a rookie . I get how good Luka has been and no one can dispute that he\u2019s a true prodigy. But go back and look at how Magic mastered his game and fueled the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers. Watch that one more time before making the argument about Luka being a better a better ball-handler or more a more impactful player than Magic was in his first two years in the league. I think we need to be careful getting caught up in the moment and metrics when making those kinds of comparisons. More than numbers From: Samuel Hunter Jan. 17, 2020 | 4:12 p.m. I love your MVP Ladders and agree with almost everything on them. This week however, I have seen two things that I do not agree with you on. First, why is James Harden below Jimmy Butler? He is averaging more points this season than Michael Jordan ever did, and more rebounds and assists than most of MJ\u2019s seasons. Butler is averaging good stats (20 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 steals) but not as good stats as Harden. Second, I have wondered this for a long time: why is Domantas Sabonis even in the top 15? His only notable stats are 17.8 ppg and 12.9 rpg. I know of several other players who are better \u2014 D\u2019Angelo Russell, Devin Booker, Trae Young, and Joel Embiid among them \u2014 and they\u2019re not on the list. I will be much obliged if you answer these questions. * * * My response: Thank you, Samuel, for the questions. It\u2019s not just about numbers or scoring numbers in particular. The Kia MVP isn\u2019t an award for the guy who scores the most. I believe in evaluating the entire game a player brings to the party, that includes all of the numbers they compile and the impact that has on their respective team, and ranking it accordingly. That\u2019s where Sabonis enters the conversation for me as well. You are welcome to disagree with my methods. I have no problem with that. From:  Luke Zwayne Jan. 17, 2020 | 2:47 p.m. Great ladder like always, Sekou! But I think it\u2019s time we start talking about Kawhi. His team is higher in the standings than Harden and Doncic\u2019s teams. I know those two guys are putting up monster numbers, but Kawhi has also been without Paul George and he\u2019s put up a 43-point game and a couple of 30+ pointers. He\u2019s just flat-out amazing on offense. * * * My response: Keen observations, Luke. And Kawhi\u2019s recent surge will be reflected on the next update of the Ladder. There\u2019s no denying the reigning Finals MVP when he plays the way he has recently. From:  Ryan Tretsky Jan. 12, 2020 | 2:36 a.m. Do you think that the overall improvement of Russell Westbrook on offense (versus the beginning of the season) over the past few weeks can make him a viable MVP candidate by the end of the year if he keeps this up? I was also surprised to see how little he has turned in over, too. It seems that he really is improving everywhere (except for 3-point shooting) since the beginning of the season. * * * My response: If he keeps it up Ryan, yes, I think Russ can play his way into the MVP conver-sation. But even if he does, it would be hard to see him supplant James Harden as the Rockets\u2019 most viable candidate for MVP. It\u2019s Harden\u2019s team and the voters understand that. Russ is cer-tainly capable of making things interesting, though, provided he continues to play as well as he has recently. A different take at the top From:  David Lau Jan. 20, 2020 | 11:37 a.m. Many thanks for your weekly MVP Ladders, which I enjoy very much. Admittedly, you have a tough job and I could probably build a MVP case for any of the players ranked in your (at least) Top 5. While I could sign off on your ranking right away, I will nonetheless give it try and explain to you my personal ranking: 1. Luka Doncic 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Lebron James 4. James Harden 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Chris Paul 9. Anthony Davis 10. Donovan Mitchell I acknowledge that there are potentially many many different criteria and weights one could apply. I am applying the following main criteria: (i) individual performance, (ii) expectations ahead of the seasons and (iii) the player\u2019s \u201cvalue\u201d to the team, i.e. what would the team be like if you subtracted that player from the roster. Without Giannis the Bucks still have All-Star-caliber players like Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe plus experienced role players like Brook Lopez, Ersan Ilyasova and George Hill. The Lakers have Davis AND James plus experienced role players like Green, Rondo, Kuzma, Howard and McGee. The Rockets still have Westbrook, Gordon and Clint Capela. The Clippers have a very strong roster with George, Williams, Harrell and Beverely. At least I hadn\u2019t expected the Heat and Mavericks to be that strong this season, but I love this surprise! I may have underestimated the Mavericks\u2019 roster, but I strongly believe that without Doncic the Mavericks wouldn\u2019t be a playoff contender. Not only is Doncic playing an outstanding season so far, but he is also lifting the Mavericks beyond all expectations and is making his teammates (much) better, which is why he is the \u201cMost Valuable Player\u201d to me.  * * * My response: I\u2019ve heard a lot of people make a similar argument, David, that the Bucks would be just fine without Giannis or that there is enough firepower on that roster without him that they\u2019d still be one of the league\u2019s truly elite teams regardless. I bet Mike Budenholzer would disagree with you. I know I do. I\u2019m always careful with that subtract-a-player argument. It\u2019s just too con-venient a theory that has nothing but hypotheticals to back it up. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

To Magic Johnson, he was an angel. Johnson tearfully recalled Stern\u2019s firm support after the Hall of Fame player learned he had HIV, and how it was the former NBA commissioner allowing him to play in the 1992 All-Star Game despite some players\u2019 fears that kept his spirits up during the darkest time of his life. \u201cThat game saved my life,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson was one of the speakers at a memorial service for Stern, who died Jan. 1 at age 77 after suffering a brain hemorrhage a few weeks earlier. Radio City Music Hall was filled with what Commissioner Adam Silver called one of the greatest collections of basketball talent in one location, from mighty big men Bill Russell and Yao Ming to dazzling distributors such as Johnson and Isiah Thomas. They listened to stories hailing Stern not only for his brilliance as a businessman, but for his commitment to social responsibility and his love of his family. Speakers, ranging from colleagues in the league to friends from before he arrived there, talked of how Stern would help people arrange doctor\u2019s appointments and score All-Star tickets, and how he loved to offer his assistance \u2014 especially, Silver noted, when it hadn\u2019t been asked. Stern spent 30 years as commissioner, the league\u2019s longest-serving leader, and Silver noted that few people in the room would have had the opportunities they did in life without Stern, whose longtime office at NBA headquarters was just a block away. \u201cHe belongs on this big stage,\u201d Silver said. \u201cHe changed the world.\u201d The 2+-hour ceremony began with Silver and ended with remarks by Stern\u2019s two sons. Eric Stern revealed his father\u2019s love of crude jokes, while older brother Andrew recalled how Stern refused to part with his wood-paneled station wagon, even long after he could afford BMWs. They both noted Stern\u2019s desire to be at their events, even if long hours at the office meant he had to miss the beginning. Of course, not everybody saw that side of Stern. Few escaped a foul-mouthed tirade if they didn\u2019t meet Stern\u2019s high expectations, and Pat Riley got tongue lashings and fines for criticizing referees, saying Stern would constantly tell him he needed to be better. Making things better was a mission of Stern\u2019s. The more the NBA grew and the further its reach expanded, the more that Stern insisted it increase its commitment to help others. Pictures and videos shown before the speakers seemingly depicted as much footage of NBA Cares events as of basketball events, with Stern helping to build houses or read with children in libraries. \u201cShame on us, he would say, if we don\u2019t do all we can with the platform we have,\u201d said Kathy Behrens, the NBA\u2019s president of social responsibility and player programs. Stern began at the NBA at a time when the league was fighting for attention, plagued by drug problems in the 1970s and struggling to gain the interest of mainstream America when nearly three-quarters of the players were black. But Stern drove employees at the league and on its teams to work through that, to turn the league into what he thought it could become. \u201cNo one had a better crystal ball than David Stern,\u201d said Val Ackerman, the commissioner of the Big East who previously was an assistant to Stern at the NBA. Ackerman choked up when discussing Stern\u2019s dedication to women\u2019s sports, how he was at the first WNBA game in New York in 1997 and remained a champion of the league even when there were early detractors. \u201cFor all the advances in women\u2019s team sports since that auspicious night, I hope historians will write that it was women\u2019s basketball and the WNBA that did it first and blazed a trail,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cI hope they\u2019ll write that David, while always quick to deflect credit, was the most important figure in the women\u2019s sports movement since Billie Jean King.\u201d Then, with King in attendance, Ackerman wrapped up her remarks by reading from a email Stern had sent her touting the WNBA\u2019s accomplishments. \u201cAs usual, I\u2019m unable to say it better,\u201d she said. \u201cWe broads truly owe him.\u201d So does Johnson, who said Stern would constantly check up on him to make sure he was healthy, and ask Johnson\u2019s wife if he was eating right. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss my friend. I\u2019m going to miss my angel,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cand now who\u2019s going to be there at the All-Star Game to make sure I\u2019m OK?\u201d"},{"id":29290,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-dallas-mavericks-nba-tv-viewers-guide","date":"2020-01-21","title":"Viewer's Guide: Clippers vs. Mavericks on NBA TV","content":" > Tonight on NBA TV: Clippers vs. Mavericks (8:30 ET) After an all-day, 14-game NBA marathon on Monday, it\u2019s only right the next day features the only one-game slate of the 2019-20 NBA season. And that one game should be a good one. Luka Doncic and the Mavericks will host Kawhi Leonard and the LA Clippers in Dallas on Tuesday night. The matchup, which could have playoff implications down the line, is sure to provide plenty of must-see moments and storylines to follow. Before the action tips off on NBA TV, get ready with a look at five reasons to watch the only NBA game of the night. * * * Luka Doncic has been on a tear during his second season in the NBA with averages of 28.9 points, 9.7 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game . But the 6-foot-7 playmaker struggled during his only matchup with the Clippers this season. On Nov. 26, LA held Doncic to 22 points on 4-for-14 shooting (0-for-8 on 3-pointers) with seven turnovers in the 114-99 loss , which snapped a five-game win streak for Dallas. Expect a motivated Doncic to bounce back when the Clippers return to town tonight. Kawhi Leonard enters Tuesday\u2019s matchup in Dallas riding his longest 30-point streak of the season . The reigning Finals MVP has tallied 30-plus points in five straight games, including a season-high 43 points on 64% shooting in LA\u2019s win against Cleveland last week. Leonard joins World B. Free and Bob McAdoo as the only Clippers players to score 30-plus points in five or more consecutive games. In fact, the 180 points scored in Leonard\u2019s last five games is the most he\u2019s ever scored over a five-game span in his career. The Clippers will need Leonard to deliver again on Tuesday as Paul George will be sidelined for a sixth straight game with a hamstring strain. George is traveling with the team on their current 6-game road trip, but he remains out. The Mavericks and Clippers feature two of the top 5 offenses in the league . The Mavs\u2019 sport the NBA\u2019s No. 1 offense with a rating of 116.1, nearly three points higher than the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 No. 2-rated offense (113.2). The Clippers come in at No. 5 with a rating of 112.4. A large amount of the offense for both teams comes from their benches, which rank No. 1 (Clippers) and No. 5 (Mavs) in scoring . The Clippers generate an NBA-best 51.7 ppg from their bench, while the Mavericks tally 42.1 ppg. Be sure to keep an eye on the two-man game from Lou Williams (20.0 ppg) and Montrezl Harrell (19.3 ppg), who do the majority of the damage for the Clippers\u2019 bench. Kristaps Porzingis has been sidelined since Dec. 31 with right knee soreness. But the 7-foot-3 sharpshooter is expected to be available against the Clippers tonight after he completed a successful practice on Sunday. \u201cThe way I\u2019m feeling, I don\u2019t see why there should be any hurdles,\u201d Porzingis said about his plan to play on Tuesday. \u201cBut you never know, so I\u2019m just putting in the work, making sure the knee is strong, leg is strong.\u201d Porzingis is averaging 17.3 ppg, 9.4 rpg and 2.1 bpg in his first full season with the Mavericks. Dallas went 6-4 over their past 10 games without Porzingis and his return should give Dallas a boost against Leonard and the Clippers. Via NBA.com senior writer John Schuhmann Clippers \u2022 Leonard\u2019s effective field goal percentage of 51.6% is the worst mark of his career . And one issue is that he hasn\u2019t been getting to the rim as much as he has in the past. Only 19% of his shots have come in the restricted area. That ranks as the 30th lowest rate among 160 players with at least 300 field goal attempts through Sunday and is down from 27% last season. \u2022 Leonard has been getting to and finishing better at the rim over the last month ( 24% of his shots in the restricted area, 70% shooting there ) than he was previously ( 16%, 65% ). With Paul George out the last five games, Leonard has averaged 33.3 points on an effective field goal percentage of 62%. That stretch has come with his season high for restricted area makes ( 8-for-9 against the Warriors on Jan. 10 ) and attempts ( 6-for-10 in New Orleans on Saturday ). \u2022 Even with Leonard\u2019s effective field goal percentage a career-low mark, the Clippers\u2019 fifth-ranked offense has been at its best ( 114.7 points scored per 100 possessions ) with the Finals MVP on the floor. His rate of 16.1 assists per 100 possessions used is a career-best mark by a healthy margin. His career-high in assists prior to this season was eight, and he\u2019s had four games of nine or more assists already this season. Mavericks \u2022 The 116.1 points per 100 possessions the Mavs have scored this season would qualify as the most efficient season in NBA history, topping that of last season\u2019s Warriors ( 115.0 ). The Mavs have scored 7.1 points per 100 possessions more than the league average (109.0), a differential that would rank this as the 10th best offensive season in the 24 years for which we have play-by-play data. \u2022 The previous meeting between these two teams ( Nov. 26 in Dallas ) was the Mavs\u2019 worst offensive game of the season (99 points on 106 possessions). Doncic got 16 free throw attempts, but struggled with his shot and had more turnovers (seven) than assists (six). The defensive assignment was split pretty evenly between Paul George (2:23 of matchup time), Maurice Harkless (2:17) and Patrick Beverley (2:06). \u2022 With Porzingis out the last 10 games, the Mavs\u2019 offense hasn\u2019t suffered. With a drop in turnovers and an increase in offensive rebounds (they lead the league in offensive rebounding percentage over the last three weeks ), they\u2019ve scored 118.6 points per 100 possessions over the 10 games. \u2022 The Mavs have suffered defensively without the guy who ranks as the league\u2019s second-best high-volume rim protector (opponents have shot just 49% at the rim when Porzingis has been there). Over the last three weeks, the Mavs rank 25th defensively , having allowed 113.9 points per 100 possessions over the 10 games without Porzingis."},{"id":29284,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/damian-lillard-sets-records-61-vs-warriors","date":"2020-01-21","title":"Damian Lillard scores 61, sets multiple records in MLK Day win","content":"The Portland Trail Blazers have struggled to find consistent footing in 2019-20, but one player who has never wavered in what he does each night is their star guard, Damian Lillard. For anyone who might have thought otherwise, he gave them a case study in his abilities in a thrilling 129-124 overtime win against the Golden State Warriors on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Portland notched its fifth win in its last 15 games, but did so thanks to a dramatic, 61-point performance from Lillard . In doing so, he topped his own franchise mark of 60 points , which he set earlier this season in a 119-115 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Nov. 8. (Before that, he also held the Blazers\u2019 single-game scoring mark when he had 59 points in a 101-86 win against the Utah Jazz on April 8, 2017.) On Monday, Lillard also set the team records for 3-pointers made in a game (11) and free throws made without a miss (he was 16-for-16 on free throws). His 61 points is also the most scored in a single game this season to date and the most points ever on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. \u201dI guess if somebody\u2019s going to beat my record, it\u2019s good to be me,\u201d Lillard said. Lillard became the first player in NBA history with 60-plus points and 10-plus 3-pointers in a game, and just the sixth player with multiple 60-point games. He also had 10 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season. He also joins Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Michael Jordan, James Harden and Kobe Bryant as the only players in league history with multiple 60-point games in a single season. \u201cWe needed a win tonight,\u201d said Lillard, per Casey Holdahl of Blazers.com . \u201cIt would have been a tough one for us to give up. We\u2019ve got a good home stretch of games, a good opportunity to get some wins against some tough teams on our home floor so it was necessary and it was on time.\u201d It was a thrilling finish for the Blazers, too, in securing a win against the struggling Warriors. Portland had to climb from a 12-point third-quarter hole but eventually took a 110-109 lead with 2:26 left. They then needed a dazzling step-back 3-pointer from Lillard with 14.9 seconds left to force overtime. Willie Cauley-Stein\u2019s dunk put the Warriors up 121-115 in the extra period. Anfernee Simons hit a 3 to pull Portland closer before Lillard\u2019s 3-pointer with less than a minute left tied it again. Gary Trent Jr.\u2019s layup gave Portland the lead with 34.6 seconds to go. Burks\u2019 3-pointer briefly gave the Warriors back the lead, but Lillard and center Hassan Whiteside each added a pair of free throws to seal it. The crowd stood and cheered as Lillard made the free throw that gave him the record. Lillard said he knew he had 59 points when he was fouled. \u201dThe guy bumped me and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going down.\u2019 They\u2019re going to have to blow this whistle and I\u2019m getting these two free throws. And that was it,\u201d he said.

Attorneys John Morgan and Nick Panagakis of the firm Morgan & Morgan say the injuries Parsons suffered in Wednesday\u2019s crash include a traumatic brain injury, disk herniation and a torn labrum. Parsons was leaving practice when hit by a driver, who the attorneys say was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Sgt. John Chafee of the Atlanta Police Department told The Associated Press that the police report was not available Monday because the public affairs unit was closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday. The Hawks said last week that Parsons suffered a concussion and whiplash. The team has added associated disk injury to his list of injuries. Parsons remains in the concussion protocol and was not with the team for Monday\u2019s game against Toronto. He was not on the bench for the team\u2019s last two games against San Antonio and Detroit. Parsons\u2019 attorneys said in a statement released Monday that the other driver admitted drinking, had alcohol in the car with him and passed out following the crash. The attorneys say the driver, who was not identified, is responsible for seriously injuring and potentially ending Mr. Parsons career as a professional athlete. The 31-year-old Parsons, acquired from Memphis last summer, has played just five games for the Hawks. He is averaging 2.8 points and is making more than $25 million in the final year of his contract."},{"id":29323,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-available-vs-celtics","date":"2020-01-20","title":"Lakers' Anthony Davis available to play vs. Celtics","content":" The Los Angeles Lakers-Boston Celtics showdown tonight ( 7:30 ET, TNT ) should have decidedly more star power in it. Lakers big man Anthony Davis will be available to play for the first time in five games. In addition, Celtics forward Jaylen Brown is available to play after missing two games and guard Kemba Walker expects to play after missing the team\u2019s last game. Davis had been out since Jan. 7 after suffering a gluteus maximus contusion in a win against the Knicks . The Lakers have won 10 of their last 11 games, their lone loss coming in a Jan. 15 upset at the hands of the Orlando Magic. In addition, Lakers guard (and former Celtics star) Rajon Rondo is questionable to play tonight with an avulsion fracture in his right ring finger. This season, Davis is averaging 27.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.5 steals and 2.6 blocks per game. The Lakers are 34-8 and the No. 1 team in the Western Conference , holding a 4 1\/2 game over the LA Clippers for that perch. They have gone 29-6 with Davis in the lineup , but scored road wins against the Thunder, Mavericks and Rockets in recent days with him out of the mix. Brown was out because of a right thumb sprain, while Walker was sidelined with left knee soreness. Boston went 0-2 in those games, suffering defeats to the Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns . This season, Brown ranks as the Celtics\u2019 second-leading scorer (20 ppg) while also posting 6.9 rpg, 2.3 apg and 1.1 spg. Walker is Boston\u2019s top scorer (22.1 ppg) and leads them in assists as well (4.9 apg). After beating the Rockets in Houston, the Lakers are now 30-0 in games they led after the third and 14-0 in Western Conference arenas outside of L.A . They have as many losses against the East (11-4) as they do against the West (23-4), and they\u2019ll finish their Grammys trip with a jaunt through the Northeast Corridor."},{"id":29280,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-kyrie-irving-out-vs-76ers","date":"2020-01-20","title":"Nets' Kyrie Irving (right hamstring) out vs. 76ers","content":" Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving is out Monday vs. the Philadelphia 76ers with soreness in his right hamstring.

Basketball fans, rejoice! We hope your calendar is clear today \u2014 or at least it will be around 2 p.m. Eastern Time \u2014 because there\u2019s plenty of basketball available to fill it up. In celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the NBA has a full slate of games starting with Pistons-Wizards ( 2 ET, League Pass ) all the way up to a Warriors-Blazers showdown to cap things off ( 10 ET, TNT ). Best of all? There\u2019s a League Pass free preview going on this week, which means you can catch pretty much every game that\u2019s on between national TV broadcasts and League Pass. It\u2019s a hoops bonanza!  2. Red-hot Grizzlies host Pelicans Nearly one month ago ( Dec. 18, to be precise ), Memphis had lost to OKC to fall to 10-18 in the West. In the month since then, the Grizzlies have the NBA\u2019s sixth-best record (10-4), a mark that includes their current seven-game win streak. The Grizzlies have knocked off equal parts struggling squads and playoff contenders as they host New Orleans in one of MLK Day\u2019s marquee games ( 5 ET, TNT ). No player has been more central to this hoops resurgence on Beale Street than Ja Morant. This game entices because of the young scorers it will feature: the dazzling Morant and the Pelicans\u2019 up-and-coming All-Star hopeful, Brandon Ingram . 3. A classic rivalry renewed Few, if any, matchups in NBA lore speak to the game and league\u2019s rich history than Lakers vs. Celtics. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s on tap tonight ( 7:30 ET, TNT ) \u2014 and we don\u2019t have to get wistful for old Magic vs. Bird showdowns as this game nears. The Lakers are coming off a big Saturday road win in Houston and have won 10 of their last 11 (which includes two wins vs. Dallas and one vs. OKC). The Celtics haven\u2019t been nearly as hot, going 2-6 over their last eight games, including embarrassing recent losses to the Pistons and Wizards. There\u2019s added star power to this game as well as the Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis and the Celtics\u2019 Jaylen Brown are available to play, while Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker will likely suit up as well.  4. Marquee matchups on League Pass Our advice to you: give that free League Pass free preview a workout today. First up in that mix would be Sixers-Nets (3 ET) . While Joel Embiid will miss this showdown, there\u2019s always Ben Simmons vs. Brooklyn (sorry, no Kyrie Irving today, either ) and the storyline of Nets rookie center Nic Claxton . The Rockets host the Thunder (5 ET) in a matchup of two Western Conference playoff squads who have struggled of late. Houston has lost three straight and four of its last five, while OKC is 2-3 in its last five games. And to cap things off, the Jazz and Pacers \u2014 two of the NBA\u2019s best all-around teams this season \u2014 meet in Salt Lake City at 9 p.m. 5. Top-flight offenses collide in Atlanta Toronto has seen its offense surge during its three-game win streak, which have included victories against the Timberwolves, Wizards and Thunder. That has pushed the Raptors to the top of the Atlantic Division as they visit the offensive-minded Hawks today ( 2:30 ET, NBA TV ). It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the Raptors\u2019 defense, too, for signs of slippage. Although they are No. 2 overall in Defensive Rating this season, since Jan. 1 they have fallen to No. 4 (105.1). Additionally, should this game get tight, two of the NBA\u2019s top clutch scorers will be on the court: Trae Young ( tied for 10th in total clutch points) and Kyle Lowry ( 20th ). 6. Don\u2019t overlook these matchups There are big showdowns to watch today, yes. But there are a handful of 5 p.m. ET games on League Pass to keep on your radar as well. Check out Bulls vs. Bucks , which is Chicago\u2019s first game since Zach LaVine lit up the Cavs for 42 on Saturday. The latest \u201cSteve Clifford Bowl\u201d is upon us as well as the Magic visit the Hornets in a showdown of two teams fighting for that No. 8 spot in the East and more consistency overall . The struggling Cavs and Knicks meet up in Cleveland and, thankfully, someone\u2019s losing streak (Cleveland has lost four straight; New York has lost four) will come to an end. Lastly, it\u2019s Kings vs. Heat from Miami as Sacramento tries to upset the NBA\u2019s best home team (the Heat are 18-1 at AmericanAirlines Arena this season). 7. On this date: Ellis\u2019 3-point record You may not remember Dale Ellis, but know this: he was a legendary 3-point shooter before it became en vogue in the NBA. On Jan. 20, 1996, he made history by becoming the first player to surpass 1,200 career 3-pointers. Today, there are more than 60 players who have hit 1,200 or more 3-pointers in their careers. But at the time of his retirement in 2000, Ellis ranked second in 3-point makes with 1,719 in his career."},{"id":29319,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-cant-miss-matchups-zion-williamson-debut","date":"2020-01-20","title":"5 Can't-Miss Matchups: Zion Williamson vs. LaMarcus Aldridge","content":" New Orleans morphs into the center of the NBA universe Wednesday, when the Pelicans host the San Antonio Spurs for the professional debut of rookie sensation Zion Williamson. Williamson isn\u2019t expected to take on massive minutes in his return, but his rare combination of size and explosiveness is sure to turn heads. Williamson\u2019s matchup with LaMarcus Aldridge headlines what\u2019s expected to be an exciting week of head-to-head clashes that also feature Kawhi Leonard versus Luka Doncic on NBA TV, as well as a clash between Lonzo Ball and Ja Morant on TNT for Martin Luther King Jr. Day: * * * \u2022 Wednesday, Jan. 22 (9:30 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Players have not yet met Williamson hasn\u2019t taken the court since Oct. 13, when he dropped 22 points to go with 10 rebounds in an exhibition victory over the Spurs. As good as Williamson looked in that outing, you can expect an even better player in this one, according to Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin, who said that \u201cwe all feel like he will be a bigger, better version of himself; a healthier version of himself going forward.\u201d Williamson\u2019s debut comes against a formidable foe in veteran LaMarcus Aldridge, who at 34 has reinvented his game somewhat to add more 3-point shooting. After Sunday\u2019s win over the Miami Heat, Aldridge had already surpassed his previous career-high in 3-pointers made (45), and he\u2019s connecting at a 43.7% clip from range. \u2022 Tuesday, Jan. 21 (8:30 ET, NBATV) Last regular season meeting: Nov. 26, 2019  Although they play different positions, you can expect to see Leonard guarding Doncic on occasion, especially if the Dallas Maverick starts to hurt the LA Clippers with his playmaking ability. The last time these teams met, Doncic committed 7 turnovers, shooting 4-for-14 from the floor and 0-for-8 from 3-point range in a loss to the Clippers. Doncic did manage to get to the line for 16 foul shots, and he knocked down 14 of them. Leonard, meanwhile, closed out the week racking up 39 points in a win over the Pelicans to become the first Clipper to score 30 points or more in five straight games since World B. Free in 1980 (11 straight games). In fact, the 180 points scored in Leonard\u2019s last five games coming into this week is the most he\u2019s ever scored in a five-game span in his career. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Friday, Jan. 24 (8 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Jan. 19, 2019  Out for the last five games due to a hamstring injury, George could be back for this one leading a Clippers squad that finished up last week winning their seventh game out of their last nine. Luckily for the Heat, this game comes at home where Miami owns a record of 18-1. Butler\u2019s teams have come out on top in three of the last five meetings against George. The last time George and Butler faced off, George scored 31 points and shot 4-for-9 from 3-point range. Butler hasn\u2019t shot the ball particularly well, hitting 12-for-33 in his last three games coming into this week. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, Jan. 20 (5 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Players haven\u2019t met yet  With Jrue Holiday missing the last seven games due to an elbow injury, Ball has stepped up to take on a more significant role. Ball notched his sixth career triple-double (and his second of the second of the season) Saturday in a loss to the LA Clippers, and he\u2019ll be counted on to deliver in this matchup against Morant. Morant on Saturday produced his 10th consecutive game with 7 assists or more, which registers as the most by a Grizzly since Brevin Knight accomplished the feat in 10-straight games in 2012. Memphis enters the week having won seven in a row, which ranks as its most consecutive victories since 2015. \u2022 Monday, Jan. 20 (5 ET, NBA League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Jan. 9, 2020  Paul returns to Houston for his second matchup of the month against the Rockets, who dropped their third-straight contest on Saturday to the Los Angeles Lakers and have lost four of their last five. Westbrook racked up 35 points in the loss to the Lakers for his fourth consecutive game of 30 points or more. In that game, Westbrook became the first Rocket besides James Harden to score 30 points or more in four consecutive games since Tracy McGrady in 2006-07. Westbrook produced 34 points the last time he faced Paul in a Rockets loss back in January. Paul dropped 21 of his 30 points in the first half Saturday in a win over the Portland Trail Blazers, but it\u2019s important to note that OKC closed out the week with a record of 7-15 against teams that are .500 or better. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, Jan. 20 (2:30 p.m., ET, NBATV) Last regular season meeting: Feb. 7, 2019  The old guard versus the new in a series in which Young has yet to notch a victory. Atlanta closed out the week with a loss to the Detroit Pistons in which they gave up 23 points off 20 turnovers with Young committing four of them. The Hawks are 5-15 at home this season, and the last time Young squared off against Lowry, the guards combined to shoot 10-for-27 from the floor and 4-for-13 from deep, as Young committed four turnovers in a losing effort. The banged-up Raptors ended last week with a 16-3 record against teams below .500, snapping a two-game home losing streak. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . * * * Michael C.

The 7-foot-3 Latvian also says he has recovered from an illness that helped extend the longer-than-expected absence, another example of the caution Dallas has shown since trading for Porzingis when he was still recovering from a major left knee injury. Porzingis went through practice with no limitations Sunday, making him optimistic about returning Tuesday against the LA Clippers ( 8:30 ET, NBA TV ). He thought he would play at Sacramento last Wednesday, but soreness in the right knee resurfaced.  \u201cWe\u2019ll probably go that way of being cautious again, not to say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to play,\u2019 and all of a sudden something happens,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cThe way I\u2019m feeling, I don\u2019t see why there should be any hurdles. But you never know.\u201d The Mavericks acquired Porzingis from the New York Knicks almost a year ago with the idea of pairing him with 20-year-old phenom and fellow European Luka Doncic. The 24-year-old Porzingis could have played late last season, but Dallas decided on extra time to recover from the torn ligament in his left knee, an injury sustained almost two years ago in what ended up being his final game with the Knicks. With Doncic and Porzingis paired this season, the Mavericks have exceeded expectations and are in position to end a three-year playoff absence, the franchise\u2019s longest in 20 years. Coach Rick Carlisle said before the start of training camp that Porzingis would get periodic rest during the season, likely on the second night of back-to-backs. The Mavericks did that with the first back-to-back, but the 2018 All-Star played both ends of the next three sets. Porzingis was coming off the last of those three back-to-backs when he said he felt a \u201cpretty sharp pinching sensation\u201d in his right knee before a game at Oklahoma City on Dec. 31. After missing seven games, Porzingis was cleared to play against the Kings but told the medical staff something didn\u2019t feel right when he was warming up. Owner Mark Cuban said the issue has been irritation of the medial collateral ligament, which he said was common in NBA players. \u201cJust play it safe,\u201d Cuban said before the 10th game Porzingis missed, Saturday against Portland. \u201cIt\u2019s just irritation. We\u2019re pushing the workouts. And that\u2019s why you push the workouts, to see if he gets irritation. He\u2019s all good.\u201d Before getting hurt with the Knicks, Porzingis\u2019 longest absence was the last seven games of his rookie year. Even though he\u2019s now been out longer with another knee issue, Porzingis said he doesn\u2019t let the injury history bother him. \u201cMost important that it feels stable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it feels stable then why would I be afraid? If it feels unstable, I think that\u2019s when maybe those things can start to creep up in your mind. I feel good. I feel stable.\u201d The Mavericks will have a shorter workout Monday during a rare three-day break between home games. Then Porzingis will hope the Sacramento experience doesn\u2019t repeat itself. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any player playing unless they\u2019re healthy,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWhen this thing came up, it\u2019s been addressed at all levels of rehab. You work back to a point where it\u2019s time to get back on the floor and play a game. He\u2019s very close.\u201d"},{"id":29282,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-royce-oneale-extension","date":"2020-01-19","title":"Jazz sign forward Royce O'Neale to 4-year, $36 million extension","content":" Utah Jazz forward Royce O\u2019Neale has signed a contract extension, the team announced Sunday . \u201cRe-signing Royce to a long-term extension was a priority for our organization,\u201d said Dennis Lindsey, Jazz executive vice president of basketball operations. \u201cRoyce is an elite defender and has really shown the ability to spread the floor with his shooting.

Two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry was in attendance as his Golden State Warriors teammate and fellow \u201cSplash Brother\u201d had his No. 1 jersey hung for perpetuity in the rafters of an unusually raucous Beasley Coliseum.

As a junior, Thompson led the Pac-10 and ranked 11th in the nation in scoring with a 21.6 points per game average, while also leading the conference in three-pointers made (98) and breaking four WSU single-season records, including points (733), and three-point field goals made. In three seasons as a starter at Washington State, Thompson played 98 games, averaging 17.9 points per contest. By the time he left after his junior season, he had scored 1,756 points (third in school history) and made what then was a school-record 242 3-pointers. He was the 11th overall pick by the Warriors in the 2011 NBA Draft. \u201cEach year I was in Pullman I had to grow,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIn my freshman year, I had so many great leaders on our team as far as veterans, you know, Daven (Harmeling), Taylor Rochestie was such a great team player, such a great point guard. When they left, I had to kind of step into that spotlight, that main go-to guy role. I took my lumps and had my slumps but those made me so much stronger.\u201d The No. 1 jersey worn by Thompson during his three seasons in Pullman will join the No. 55 worn by Steve Puidokas as the only two retired jerseys in the WSU men\u2019s basketball program. Thompson also becomes just the seventh person at WSU to have his number retired in any sport, joining football\u2019s Mel Hein and Jack Thompson, and baseball\u2019s Buck Bailey, Bobo Brayton and John Olerud. As a member of the Golden State Warriors, Thompson has helped lead team to three NBA titles and five-straight appearances in the NBA Finals (2015-19). Thompson owns career averages of 19.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 33.1 minutes per game over eight seasons, all with Golden State. His 1,798 three-point field goals made are 18th all-time in NBA history and he owns the NBA single-game record with 14 three-pointers made established in 2018. He has been selected an NBA All-Star five times and twice named to the All-NBA Third-Team. In 2018-19 he was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Second-Team and won the NBA Three-Point Contest as part of the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend. In addition, he was named to the All-Rookie First Team in 2012. Thompson has won gold medals at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the 2014 World Cup and 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship while representing USA Basketball. Earlier this season, Thompson\u2019s teammate Draymond Green had his No. 23 jersey retired by the Michigan State men\u2019s basketball program during a ceremony in East Lansing, Mich. on December 3, 2019.

The changes remain a real possibility. The new twist, as detailed in a memo the NBA sent to teams Friday, is that much of the feedback the league received on the ideas for change suggested that more time is necessary to implement them correctly. In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press , the league told its teams that it is now working to develop a more comprehensive proposal and plan. The board will be updated at the April meeting and more talks are expected then, but barring a major change no vote will occur. The league sent a detailed plan to teams last month, suggesting changes such as a 78-game regular season, an in-season tournament for all teams and a reseeding of the playoffs when the field is cut to the final four clubs. The reseeding after two rounds of the playoffs was already a hot-button issue around the league, since it raised the potential for daunting travel for teams and essentially would eliminate the tradition of conference finals. But the in-season tournament also prompted scheduling concerns. The leagues proposal that was sent to teams last month mapped out a scenario where the tournament would begin with group stage games on Nov. 24, 2021. Group play would run through Dec. 11, with quarterfinals on Dec. 13 and 14, semifinals on Dec. 16 and a championship game on Dec. 18. That comes close to Christmas, one of the biggest days on the NBA calendar. In the latest memo, the NBA hinted that feedback suggested that schedule wouldn\u2019t be optimal \u2014 saying the tournament would need to be \u201ccarefully timed to ensure appropriate protection\u201d for such events as Christmas Day games. These potential changes should be considered on a more comprehensive, multiseason basis, providing sufficient lead time for optimal planning and monetization, the league said in Fridays memo to teams. The plan, until now, was for the board to vote on whether to make the changes for 2021-22, with an option of extending them into the 2022-23 season. Commissioner Adam Silver, since at least 2016, has talked about an in-season tournament, a format that is customary in European soccer. The NBA also has commissioned studies of how fans feel about potential changes. Among the findings were that 60% want a shorter regular season, 68% are interested in an in-season tournament and 75% are interested in a play-in tournament to decide the final spots in the 16-team playoff field."},{"id":29379,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-falls","date":"2020-01-17","title":"Giannis' aggressive style of play finds him on the deck -- a lot","content":" MILWAUKEE \u2014 Fall down 10 times, stand up 11. Anyone who remembers that quirky Dwyane Wade sneaker commercial from early in the Miami Heat star\u2019s hard-knocks career might notice some inflation in the numbers. But math is math and it has become fairly common for Giannis Antetokounmpo to exceed Wade\u2019s \u201cfall seven, stand eight\u201d resilience as he bangs his way through what potentially will be a second consecutive Kia MVP season for the Milwaukee Bucks. Against the Boston Celtics at Fiserv Forum, in TNT\u2019s early game Thursday, Antetokounmpo unofficially fell or got knocked to the floor 10 times. Whether fouled, fouling or jostled off-balance in some physical play, that\u2019s how often the Greek Freak crashed to the court on plays that showed up in the advanced box score on this site. There might have been more, say, a momentary trip over a baseline cameraman, or a stumble chasing the ball into the VIP seats. Collisions of this sort \u2014 sometimes tangled with an opponent, always losing in a battle with gravity \u2014 aren\u2019t out of ordinary across the league. But in their frequency and their cumulative impact, they\u2019re beginning to loom as one of the few things that could derail Milwaukee\u2019s marvelous season. There\u2019s a presence at Bucks games, either in the stands, on the scoreboard or during commercial breaks on their broadcasts, that drives home the potential. David Gruber, longtime personal-injury lawyer\/Bucks superfan, is a sponsor whose catchphrase booms over the P.A. system and pops up in the TV games: \u201cOne call, that\u2019s all.\u201d Well, how \u2018bout this: One fall, that\u2019s all. As in, one fall, that\u2019s it . Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a surprise that Antetkokounmpo hasn\u2019t yet gone splat! Given his size (6-foot-11, 240 pounds), his lack of padding by body-fat percentage, the distance he has to fall to go from vertical to horizontal and the endless acute angles at which his long limbs can get twisted as he hurtles toward the hardwood, he would seem a candidate for repeated extended layoffs by now. So far, though, the Bucks don\u2019t sound too worried. \u201cYou can always kind of tell, even when they go down hard, if someone is going to be OK or not,\u201d veteran shooter Kyle Korver said. You mean, if they bounce or not? Antetokounmpo might look like he\u2019s made of rubber or plastic, but c\u2019mon, that\u2019s plain ol\u2019 flesh and bones. Korver laughed. \u201cCertainly, he plays so hard and he knows one speed,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s just full throttle right at the basket. And he gets hit, he gets fouled a lot. He shot 20 free throws [against the Celtics] and probably could have shot a bunch more. But that\u2019s his game. You\u2019re not going to change that.\u201d Said center Brook Lopez: \u201cHe plays so hard, that\u2019s just kind of the way it is. Fortunately it\u2019s very rare where it\u2019s awkward or anything like that. He has such great balance and control in the way he plays the game, pretty typically he\u2019s in control at least a little bit when he goes down. So that\u2019s a silver lining.\u201d Korver said there is a skill to falling without breaking and his remarkable teammate seems to have it. \u201cI mean, I put my kids in gymnastics really young just to learn how to fall,\u201d Korver said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t [know how]. Some guys try to take charges, they get hurt. It\u2019s like an art form.\u201d Antetokounmpo shared after the Bucks\u2019 128-123 victory that, in his view, all the falling, flailing and flopping in the league is overdone. These are, after all, finely tuned, young, strong athletes who often topple over as if tapped by a feather. \u201cThe NBA, the way it\u2019s built, it wants you to flop,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIt wants you to, y\u2019know, be weak kind of. Because if you\u2019re strong and going through contact, they don\u2019t call the foul. But when you\u2019re like just flopping \u2026 they\u2019re going to call the foul. That\u2019s not who I am. That\u2019s not what I want to do. I\u2019m just going to try to go through contact. \u201cThere are going to be times guys are going to grab me or push me. I\u2019ve got to do a better job of showing it more so the refs can see guys are holding me, pushing me, just being physical.\u201d He showed it plenty Thursday. No official stat exists for how many times a player falls to the floor in a game \u2014 which seems like a rather glaring hole in the sport\u2019s analytics circa 2020. Such a tracking stat could be broken down by defensive tumbles (charges attempted and drawn), offensive upendings (both fouls and no-calls) and even 50\/50 falls, such as diving for an extra possession or tying up an opponent to force a jump ball. The numbers crunchers in this case aren\u2019t keeping up. Last spring, focusing on a Boston vs. Philadelphia game in March, ESPN.com did a piece on Joel Embiid\u2019s tendency to fall after the Sixers center went down nine times. A forensic review of his games found that Embiid averaged 3.3 times falls, flops and follow-throughs to the floor in 2018-19. That meant he went down about once every 10 minutes. Players such as Blake Griffin (once per 14 minutes), Russell Westbrook (once per 12) and James Harden (once per eight) had their own high frequencies of falling, by the story\u2019s calculations. Well, Antetokounmpo went down once every 3.5 minutes against the Celtics. Here is a rundown of his fall-downs: \u2014 11:22, first quarter : Pushed to the floor by Gordon Hayward as he tried to post up. \u2014 9:34, 1Q : Daniel Theis knocks down Antetokounmpo in the lane. \u2014 11:38, 2Q : Fouled and bumped by Brad Wanamaker on a spin move in the lane. \u2014 1:04, 2Q : Banged by Semi Ojeleye as Antetokounmpo attacks the paint. \u2014 9:34, 3Q : Drives right side of the lane, toppled by Jayson Tatum . \u2014 6:39, 3Q : With Brook Lopez\u2019s 3 FGA in the air, Antetokounmpo cuts to the hoop for rebounding position. Marcus Smart throws his rear end into the Greek Freak\u2019s legs for a \u201cTimber!\u201d moment. The Bucks star gets whistled for a loose ball foul as his coach, Mike Budenholzer, reacts in disbelief. \u2014 9:55, 4Q : Fouled to the floor while driving in isolation against Hayward. \u2014 8:56, 4Q : Under the rim with Enes Kanter, he goes up for a putback and gets hit from behind , landing awkwardly on his back. \u2014 6:31, 4Q : Ojeleye backpedals into the paint as Antetokounmpo cuts left, and the defender goes down before contact . At which point Antetokounmpo trips over the prone Celtic. \u2014 1:19, 4Q : Marcus Smart isn\u2019t set and gets called for a blocking foul , going down from the contact. Antetokounmpo inadvertently steps on Smart\u2019s hip and falls too. In all that down-on-the-court time, the moment that rankled the Bucks most was the fake charge drawn by Ojeleye. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching a lot of clips and I\u2019ve seen a lot of plays where guys try to take a charge but they fall down before [contact],\u201d Antetkounmpo said. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous because I could sprain my ankle. Especially when I\u2019m about to spin, they can trip me. That\u2019s what happened. I tried to spin and he was on the floor, and I tripped. But you can\u2019t control what you can\u2019t control. You\u2019ve got to live with it.\u201d Budenholzer was more protective of his guy. \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge concern,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIf and when players are falling before contact, there\u2019s speed and knees and legs that are basically putting Giannis in a dangerous place. I think it\u2019s a tough game to call. Giannis is always in attack mode. But if there\u2019s no contact and guys are falling and\/or underneath him, that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Lopez said that falling down is a refuge of, if not scoundrels, at least the over-matched. \u201cSome guys tend to guard Giannis, they just fall down. That\u2019s like their only option defensively,\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts him in a dangerous position the way he\u2019s going. \u2026 If it\u2019s not called the right way, you can injure someone.\u201d What can Antetokounmpo do to keep himself upright more often? He could play less aggressively. He could limit his attack inside, where the worst tangles and tumbles occur. He also could make opponents pay more directly by making more than 61 percent of his free throws. He missed 10 of 20 against Boston, a rate that will incentivize opponents to send him to the line by any means necessary. Each time he goes down, there\u2019s a change he might stay there. Which produces a corresponding chance that an East rival might leapfrog the Bucks in their Finals aspirations. Why wouldn\u2019t Boston be eager to use physical defenders such as Smart, Ojeleye, Wannemaker and Kanter on him, playing aggressively right back at Antetokounmpo? Asked about possible ill intent, Lopez said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really come up. That can be some teams\u2019 option. I think we\u2019ve run into a lot of teams with good guys where it hasn\u2019t been completely obvious, but guys are, you can see, definitely more physical with him. \u201cSome of the contact he has to fight through just to get through a cross-screen to a post-up would be an automatic call for some guys. For him, it\u2019s different. I know Giannis isn\u2019t \u2018other people,\u2019 but you\u2019re taken aback for a second.\u201d Antetokounmpo all but shrugged. \u201cI cannot be thinking that, about plays if I\u2019m going to get hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m really good at avoiding situations where you can get hurt and avoiding guys on the floor. It\u2019s amazing, if somebody is taking a charge, you\u2019ve got to step in the right place or you might sprain your ankle. Hopefully [you don\u2019t] step and hurt your knee or something.\u201d \u201cI just try to be aggressive and be in the moment and my instincts take over.\u2019 Who knows? In the end, if the Bucks play into June, they might credit the camaraderie and bonding that developed from all those times George Hill, Wesley Matthews, Donte DiVincenzo, Pat Connaughton and the rest stuck out their hands and helped their leader up off the floor. As long as they don\u2019t have to use a spatula one of these nights. # # # Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

With only 612 games to go, here are some things of note as we head into the Week 13 weekend \u2026 * * * The Utah Jazz\u2019s 10-game winning streak came to an end in New Orleans on Thursday in what was, statistically, their third-worst defensive game of the season (138 points allowed on 112 defensive possessions). Brandon Ingram went off for a career-high 49 points , and the Jazz allowed the Pelicans to register 23 fast break points and 64 points in the paint ( their second-highest total of the season ). One would think that a 15-2 stretch for the Jazz would come with elite defense. But over those 17 games, the Jazz have ranked just 11th defensively , allowing 109.0 points per 100 possessions (after allowing 105.0 through their first 24 games ). Thursday wasn\u2019t the first time this month that the Jazz struggled to defend Ingram . Actually, the offense has fueled Utah\u2019s run. Through their first 24 games, the Jazz ranked 24th offensively , scoring just 105.1 points per 100 possessions. Over the last 17, they\u2019ve scored a league-best 118.7 . The improved offense has started with Joe Ingles, who has averaged 16.5 points on an effective field goal percentage of 68.3% over the last 17 games (after averaging just 7.5 on 47.3% through the first 24). The start of the run came in Ingles\u2019 fourth straight start in place of the injured Mike Conley. And that\u2019s the one complication with how well the Jazz have been playing. All this success has come without Conley, who\u2019s like the much-less-talked-about (or talkative) Kyrie Irving of the Western Conference this season. The 32-year-old point guard struggled (shooting 37%) in his first six weeks with his new team before suffering a hamstring injury in early December . He appears close to a return and you have to wonder how his reintegration will affect both Ingles and the Utah offense as a whole. In their 285 minutes on the floor together, Conley and Ingles have combined to shoot 38% (though 39% from 3-point range) and the Jazz have scored less than a point per possession . Ingles has clearly been more comfortable in the starting lineup than he was coming off the bench. When Conley did come back for one game (before suffering a setback with his hamstring), Ingles stayed in the starting lineup, and it was Royce O\u2019Neale who came off the bench. Thus far, the Jazz\u2019s five-best-players lineup \u2014 Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Ingles and Rudy Gobert \u2014 has played 117 total minutes together , with sub-par offensive numbers. Jazz coach Quin Snyder doesn\u2019t want to hear the narrative that Conley\u2019s injury had something to do with Ingles finding his groove, though he does say that Ingles has been better with more touches. \u201cI think one of the biggest things for Joe is he\u2019s had the ball in his hands and making decisions in pick-and-roll,\u201d Snyder said earlier this week. \u201cHe\u2019s also not worrying about whether the ball goes in. He\u2019s just playing with a lot of freedom. He\u2019s just more definitive when he\u2019s shooting the ball. \u201cJoe\u2019s a really good player. Sometimes when you start the year at a level that you haven\u2019t been at, it\u2019s more noticeable. So we\u2019re happy the way Joe\u2019s playing. We\u2019ll be happy when we get Mike back.\u201d Ingles is unconcerned about what may happen when Conley returns. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought too much about it, because I think it\u2019ll just happen naturally. He\u2019s played so long and he has such a high basketball IQ that he\u2019ll come in and fit in right away. We\u2019ll obviously try to get him involved and try to speed up the process for him so he feels comfortable.\u201d Certainly, staggering minutes can allow for all three of the Jazz\u2019s ball-handlers to have some time running the offense. And even if there\u2019s an adjustment period with Conley back in the rotation, they still have a long time to figure things out. With a 15-2 record over the last 5 1\/2 weeks, they\u2019ve given themselves some room for error. Maybe the right perspective is to say that, if the Jazz are playing this well without one of their best players, they\u2019re a championship contender when they\u2019re fully operational. \u201cI think he\u2019ll make us more dangerous than we are now,\u201d Ingles said of Conley. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be ups and downs and we\u2019ll figure it out along the way, but we\u2019ll be excited to get him back.\u201d After a 2-1 trip, the Jazz are back home for their next two games . They\u2019ll host the Kings on Saturday ( 9 p.m. ET, League Pass ) and the Pacers on Monday. At this point, the Jazz haven\u2019t provided any kind of timeline for Conley\u2019s return. The Celtics almost erased a 27-point deficit in Milwaukee on Thursday. Kemba Walker got hot late in the second quarter, the Celtics hit some late 3-pointers, and they came just a couple possessions short of a miraculous comeback against the NBA\u2019s best team. Of course, the Celtics wouldn\u2019t have had to come back from 27 if they didn\u2019t put themselves in that hole. The Bucks led 22-8 to start the game and also had a 22-11 run to start the second period. The Bucks are a particularly tough opponent, but a slow start was a familiar issue for the Celtics. Boston has the league\u2019s fifth-best point differential , but has been its third-worst team in the first six minutes of the first quarter. Over their 40 games, the Celtics have been outscored by 68 points in the first six minutes. That may not seem like a lot, but it translates to 13.6 points per 48. Only the Wizards (-20.6 per 48) and the Warriors (-17.5 per 48) have been worse in the first six minutes of games. Slow starts weren\u2019t an issue early in the season, but the Celtics have trailed after the first six minutes in 11 of their last 14 games. That stretch includes an early deficit (in a game in which the Celtics never led) against the aforementioned Wizards. Most of the deficits haven\u2019t been big. And it\u2019s better to be bad at the start of games than at the end. The Celtics rank as the 14th best first-quarter team overall (+0.8 points per 100 possessions), because they\u2019ve generally been terrific (+70, +14 per 48 minutes) in the second half of the opening period. But Thursday was the fourth time in their last nine games that the Celtics have trailed by double-digits with six minutes to go in the first quarter. The issues in the first six minutes have mostly been on offense, where Gordon Hayward (effective field goal percentage of 46%), Marcus Smart (30%), Jayson Tatum (41%) and Kemba Walker (47%) have all shot much less effectively than they have after the first six minutes. Smart has the biggest differential of the group (though with the smallest sample size \u2013 just 35 shots), and when everybody\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s the one coming off the bench. The Celtics have had all five of their top perimeter players healthy for just 10 of their 40 games, and maybe that\u2019s a factor in their slow starts. The Celtics have lost five of their last seven games. They\u2019ll try to put an end to that slide when they host the Phoenix Suns on Saturday ( 7 ET, League Pass ). They\u2019ll then face the Lakers for the first time this season on Monday ( 7:30 ET, TNT ). The Hawks-Timberwolves trade that went down on Thursday didn\u2019t exactly shake up the league. It involved the last-place team in the East, the 13th-place team in the West, and three players on expiring contracts that have been coming off the bench for most of the last five weeks. It\u2019s difficult to see how the trade helps the Wolves, unless they have definitive plans for the open roster spot that the trade has created. With a brutal-shooting set of wings, they rank 29th in 3-point percentage , a category in which Crabbe once ranked second among individuals . But that was three years ago and Teague has been the better shooter of the two this season. The trade more clearly addresses a need for the team \u2013 the Hawks \u2013 that has far less of a chance of competing for a playoff spot (the Wolves are just three games in the loss column out of eighth place in the West). No team was in need of another point guard more than Atlanta. The Hawks have the league\u2019s 29th-ranked offense , having scored just 103.4 points per 100 possessions through the first half of the season. But they\u2019ve scored 108.2 per 100 (a little less than the league average) with Trae Young on the floor and just 90.7 with Young off the floor . That\u2019s the largest on-off differential in regard to points scored per 100 possessions among the 276 players who have logged at least 500 minutes this season. Teague will not be available to provide some relief when the Hawks visit San Antonio on Friday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, League Pass ). He could make his Atlanta re-debut when they host the Pistons on Saturday.  On the other end of the floor, the biggest differentials belong to a bunch of reserves, Gorgui Dieng (whose defense has kept the Wolves somewhat afloat without Karl-Anthony Towns), Joel Embiid and Paul Millsap. Reserves get to defend other reserves, so they will, in general, have lower marks in regard to the number of points their team allows per 100 possessions while they\u2019re on the floor. After Embiid and Millsap, the next full-time starters on the list are Marc Gasol (-6.5), Kawhi Leonard (-5.2) and Rudy Gobert (-4.8). That trio has won five of the last seven Defensive Player of the Year awards . The league hit the midway point of the season on Thursday, putting 618 of 1,230 games in the books. Through those 618 games, the league has scored 108.9 points per 100 possessions. With each month, we\u2019ve seen pace slow down and efficiency go up. The 108.9 points per 100 possessions is slightly higher than the 108.7 that the league had scored at the midway point last season (through Jan. 9, when 616 games had been played). Last season turned out to be the most efficient (109.7 per 100 over the full year) of the 23 full seasons for which we have play-by-play data (and likely the most efficient season in NBA history). Slightly ahead at the midway point, 2019-20 could bump \u201918-19 down the list. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

There is LeBron James, with 16-plus seasons of tread, delivering nightly gems with his needle-threading passing , improved 3-point shooting , presence and (fingers crossed) worry-free health. There is Anthony Davis, fulfilling all the purple-and-gold dreams , upstaging LeBron on occasion and sending fright to the other team\u2019s bench. Dwight Howard is making folks forget how and why Kobe Bryant loathed him during his first Lakers go-round. And a host of others are pitching in to keep the Lakers both in the Western Conference\u2019s penthouse and on the radar of anyone searching for a midseason championship favorite . Then there\u2019s Kuzma, now closely cropped on top and fully blonde, looking like the long lost 6-foot-8 twin brother of Eminem. He\u2019s the one who, by the way, once authored a hit song called \u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d with this chorus: \u201cSo won\u2019t the real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?\u201d Curiously, that\u2019s exactly what the Lakers are pleading: Will the real Kyle Kuzma please stand up? And can he do that before the February 6 trade deadline Kuzma is the noticeable hiccup in L.A.\u2019s flow so far. The 24-year old forward can\u2019t seem to string together outstanding games to erase all doubt in him being the Lakers\u2019 third option. His stats are all down in 2019-20 (12.9 ppg, 43% shooting) after he assumed the lead singer role last season once LeBron suffered a season-ending groin injury . The second half of the Lakers\u2019 season begins Saturday in Houston ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC ) as a challenging five-game road trip could decide whether Kuzma is the answer or still the riddle. His name is in trade rumors and this is where it gets interesting, because the Lakers tried to swap Kuzma last spring and then resisted trading him this summer \u2014 both times for Davis. Neither the Lakers nor Pelicans will publicly discuss their conversations, but there are strong indications the Lakers were adamant about keeping Kuzma over Brandon Ingram (who eventually was included in the Davis trade ). It would\u2019ve made sense as Ingram dealt with blood clots last season and was inconsistent when healthy. He also essentially played the same position as Davis, while Kuzma was more of a complimentary third piece. Ingram is off to a career-best season with the Pelicans and is in the mix for both an All-Star berth and the Kia Most Improved Player award. The Pelicans are sure they got the right guy from the Lakers in that megadeal. Do the Lakers feel the same about keeping Kuzma? Kuzma was respected enough to snag an invite to the Team USA workouts last summer and made the squad for the World Championships. Then he developed a stress reaction , which spoiled the mood both for Team USA and the Lakers, because it caused him to miss the FIBA World Cup, all of training camp and the first nine games of this season. That was critical, given that the Lakers had a new coach (Frank Vogel) and added Davis and others. Kuzma missed valuable on-court bonding time and was slow to adapt once he healed. Since then, his play has been sketchy. As the designated sixth man (who was initially projected as a potential All-Star), Kuzma\u2019s impact on the club is average at best. Some nights he disappears, others he flickers for a few quarters, and for a handful of games he has sizzled. On a developing team, that would be fine. But the Lakers have the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in their heads and can\u2019t afford to be locked into a nightly guessing game with Kuzma. They need to know: Will the real Kuzma please stand up? \u201cI\u2019m a rhythm player,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cAnytime I get big minutes I feel I can produce and my game shows.\u201d In a Jan. 11 win in OKC \u2014 when Davis and LeBron both sat out \u2014 Kuzma scored 36 points on 15-for-24 shooting. It was cautiously hailed as Kuzma\u2019s long-awaited wakeup call because in the game before, also without Davis, Kuzma had 26 in a win in Dallas . Vogel said then: \u201cI really think that\u2019s going to carry over to when those guys (James and Davis) come back, and we\u2019ll continue to see his minutes grow and grow throughout the season.\u201d Then came Wednesday\u2019s narrow loss to Orlando . Kuzma was curiously on the bench next to a street-clothed Davis, in the fourth quarter moment of truth. The reason? Kuzma was outplayed on both ends in much of that game and finished with four points on 2-for-10 shooting in 27 minutes. Without Kuzma, the Lakers relied on LeBron. He shot poorly late, missing a late free throw and a potential game-tying shot . In that situation, the Lakers looked outside their usual sources for help. Normally it would be Davis, who was hurt, or Kuzma, whose game was hurt. \u201cWe would\u2019ve left Kuz in there but the other guys were playing really well,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cThose were the guys who were shooting the ball the best.\u201d So, what next? Normally, teams comfortably leading the conference don\u2019t make a major shakeup at the trade deadline. There\u2019s too much risk in terms of chemistry and incorporating a new face into the mix before the playoffs. Trading Kuzma wouldn\u2019t necessarily fix the situation unless there\u2019s a distressed asset \u2014 an All-Star type needing a change of scenery \u2014 coming in return. Yet, he\u2019s their only valuable trade commodity and it only takes one team to think Kuzma would be better in their system than he is with the Lakers. Kuzma is also eligible for a contract extension this summer. If the Lakers have no plans to extend him, why not trade him now? The other option is keeping Kuzma and being patient. There\u2019s a theory that Kuzma is struggling to fit in next to a pair of superstars instead of just one. Being the third wheel on a team with LeBron wasn\u2019t easy for Kevin Love and Chris Bosh, at least initially. Whatever the reason, the Lakers are in a situation with Kuzma that they least expected last fall. Back then, there was optimistic talk of having three All-Stars on the roster, of allowing LeBron and Davis to take rests because Kuzma could help bail them out, of going into the playoffs with the league\u2019s finest trio. That still might be the case, but suddenly it\u2019s not a slam dunk. The Lakers are still searching for that third player to pair with their two future Hall of Famers. They want Kuzma to inform them if that player is him, or someone else. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

For the Utah Jazz, one of the hottest teams in the league, those words ring true. If coach Quin Snyder\u2019s team has any chance of challenging in the top-heavy Western Conference this season, they\u2019ll have to do it with defense. That side of things in Utah is anchored by the reigning two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert . Gobert\u2019s impact on a game can be lost on eyes fixed on offensive accomplishments and amazing feats therein. But there\u2019s no overshadowing how his presence is a game-changer for a Jazz team that makes its bones on the back of the best rim protector on the planet. \u201cHe\u2019s really turned into the master of a lost art,\u201d an Eastern Conference general manager said of Gobert. \u201cThe way we play in our league now, the way the game is skewed to offensive players, it\u2019s hard for regular eyes to gain a full appreciation of just how big a difference he makes for them. \u201cIt\u2019s really a beautiful thing to see a big man control the action the way he can around the rim. We\u2019re so focused on the 3-point line and the game from distance, but go back and watch the action around the basket and he\u2019s on a level all his own these days.\u201d Gobert can singlehandedly blow up the opposition\u2019s offensive possessions without blocking any shots. His presence alone creates the appropriate fear needed for the Jazz to feed off his game. And if you need advanced metrics to verify Gobert\u2019s impact both defensively and overall, this recent NBA.com\/Stats breakdown from Brian Martin is all you need. He\u2019s really turned into the master of a lost art \u2026 It\u2019s really a beautiful thing to see a big man control the action the way he can around the rim.\u201d Anonymous Eastern Conference general manager, on Rudy Gobert Gobert\u2019s continued improvement on the offensive end has helped him shove his way into the Kia MVP conversation this week, too. He\u2019s tied for second in rebounds per game with Houston\u2019s Clint Capela (14.5 rpg), trailing only Detroit\u2019s Andre Drummond (15.7 rpg). Gobert is also averaging 15.0 ppg on a career-best 67.4% shooting overall and 1.9 blocks per game. That last number might be even higher, but like a shutdown cornerback in football, Gobert is rarely tested by players who know his reputation of erasing buckets. It all adds up to a critical component for Snyder, who has built the Jazz into a legitimate contender in a way that few other teams have during this pace-and-space era. Defense comes first in Utah, with Gobert quite literally front and center. * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 30.0 points, 12.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.2 steals, 1.1 blocks The Bucks are 37-6 as the best start in franchise history keeps on rolling with Antetokounmpo driving them night after night. He was his typically brilliant self in Thursday\u2019s win against Boston, notching his ninth game of the season with 30 or more points and 15 or more rebounds. Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns ranks second in the league this season with three such games. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 25.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, 10.9 assists, 1.3 steals The Lakers\u2019 9-game winning streak couldn\u2019t survive Markelle Fultz and the improving Orlando Magic Wednesday. LeBron did his work (19 points and a career-high tying 19 assists), but he missed a 3-pointer with three seconds left that would have changed the outcome. LeBron\u2019s mettle is being tested with Anthony Davis out recovering and rehabbing that bruised tailbone. He seems more than up to the task, based on what we\u2019ve seen so far this season.  Last week: No. 3 Season stats: 28.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, 9.0 assists, 1.1 steals Doncic delivered his 12th triple-double of this season (and third one in January) in Wednesday\u2019s win against Sacramento . He makes it look so easy sometimes, but don\u2019t let that fool you. What Doncic is doing to the competition has raised the stakes for the Mavericks, winners of three straight as a Friday matchup with Portland looms ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). Last week: No. 5 Season stats: 20.5 points, 6.9 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.9 steals The Heat this season are at their best in Miami, where they improved to a league-best 18-1 after Wednesday\u2019s win against the Spurs . Butler\u2019s tenaciousness had a lot to do with that win in particular. He\u2019s the tone-setter for a team that has proved to be one of the league\u2019s toughest to deal with anywhere. With Butler serving as the conduit, up-and-comers like Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro and others have thrived as Miami\u2019s season grinds on. Last week: No. 4 Season stats: 37.2 points, 7.5 assists, 6.2 rebounds, 1.7 steals Harden and the Rockets are reeling right now, losers of three of their last four games. Harden was held to 13 points in a Wednesday loss to Portland, his lowest scoring total since Jan. 18, 2018 . That loss to the Blazers prompted a \u201clengthy locker room meeting\u201d as a concerned coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said his team\u2019s \u201ccollective spirit\u201d is off. A Saturday visit from the Los Angeles Lakers ( 8:30 ET, ABC ) is either the best or worst thing for Harden and the Rockets. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

Should Harris be an All-Star? The Sixers host the Bulls tonight ( 7 ET, ESPN ) in what will mark the final national TV appearance by Chicago. While that\u2019s an interesting tidbit, of course, perhaps what\u2019s worth watching more tonight is the play of Philadelphia forward Tobias Harris. In the final All-Star voting update , Harris\u2019 name was nowhere to be found despite him being one of three players (Jaylen Brown and Karl-Anthony Towns are the others) to average at least 19.5 points, 70 3-pointers and shoot 48% overall and 35% on 3-pointers. This kind of spotlight could be just the stage Harris needs to bolster his All-Star case. 2. Stretch run begins for Mavs, Blazers Props to our Michael C. Wright, who didn\u2019t find it a stretch in our season preview to tab the Mavs as playoff hopeful in 2019-20. As a showdown with Portland looms ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ), Dallas is 1\/2 game behind Houston for the No. 5 seed. As for the Blazers, the hope was they\u2019d use last season\u2019s run to the West finals to do even bigger things \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t been the case. They\u2019re No. 10 in the West and tonight\u2019s game is their second of three straight against teams over .500. The Mavs\u2019 schedule is fairly challenging ahead, too, so this game could set the tone for how each team begins the final leg of 2019-20. 3. Surprising squads meet in OKC At the season\u2019s halfway point, both Miami and Oklahoma City are drawing rave reviews for their showing so far . As they meet tonight ( 8 ET, League Pass ), know that both teams are capable foes when facing the opposing conference (Miami is 9-6 vs. the West; OKC is 16-12 vs. the East). Heat rookie Kendrick Nunn has overcome a mini-slump and has been solid vs. West foes since Christmas, averaging 23.5 ppg against them in that span. As for the Thunder, their guard trio of Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder (deservedly) get a lot of credit. Don\u2019t overlook Danilo Gallinari, though, who has been averaging 21.3 ppg since Christmas . 4. Happy Birthday, Dwyane Wade! The former Miami Heat legend is just a week away from having his No. 3 immortalized by the franchise in a special ceremony. As he turns 38 today, though, it\u2019s time to take a minute an look back on a player who won three championships , a Finals MVP and provided countless memories to NBA fans in his 16 seasons. These 35 plays below are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to encapsulating what made Wade so great. 5. On this date: LeBron makes history Seven years ago today, LeBron James surpassed the 20,000-career points mark in a Miami Heat road win against the Golden State Warriors . James eclipsed the milestone when he made a short jumper with 2:45 left in the second quarter to give him 20,001 career points. He needed 18 points entering the game to be the 38th NBA player to reach the mark. James was 28 years, 17 days old when he accomplished the feat, besting the mark previously set by Kobe Bryant (29 years, 122 days old)."},{"id":29320,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dj-augustin-out-weeks-left-knee-injury","date":"2020-01-17","title":"D.J.

In a deal first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , the Hawks have sent Allen Crabbe to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for guard-forward Treveon Graham and former Hawks guard Jeff Teague. The teams confirmed the deal on Thursday afternoon. Teague played for the Hawks from 2009-10 to 2015-16, earning an All-Star bid in 2014-15 after he averaged 15.9 points, 2.5 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game. Teague is averaging 13.2 ppg, 2.6 rpg and 6.1 apg this season for Minnesota, appearing in 34 games with 13 starts. For his career with Atlanta, Teague averaged 11.5 ppg, 2.1 rpg and 5.0 apg in 439 games (305 starts) and ranks fifth all time in franchise history in assists (2,671). He will likely serve as a backup to Hawks star guard Trae Young, who currently ranks third in the NBA in scoring (29.1 ppg) and fourth in assists (8.5 apg). The Hawks originally parted with Teague in the summer of 2016, trading him to the Indiana Pacers as part of a three-team deal that saw the Utah Jazz acquire George Hill and the Hawks get Taurean Prince. In the summer of 2017, Teague agreed to a reported three-year, $57 million deal with the Wolves as Minnesota aimed to make a playoff push. The Timberwolves were busy in the summer of 2017, adding Teague and veteran big man Taj Gibson in free agency while also working an offseason trade for All-Star swingman Jimmy Butler. While the moves paid off in a playoff trip, the Wolves were swept in the first round of the 2018 playoffs by the Houston Rockets. From there, Minnesota\u2019s promising future fell apart as Butler demanded a trade early in 2018-19 and the Wolves went from 47-35 to 36-46 last season. Graham has been a regular rotation player for the Wolves, averaging 5.2 ppg in 20.1 mpg. The undrafted swingman is on his third team in four seasons. Crabbe was also a role player for the Hawks, averaging 5.1 ppg in 18.6 mpg. Kevin Smith of Yahoo Sports reports this trade may just be the beginning of more deals for both the Hawks and Wolves. The teams have struggled so far this season, with Atlanta as the Eastern Conference\u2019s worst team at 9-32 while Minnesota is 15-25 and No. 12 in the West, 3 1\/2 games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the No. 8 spot. Teague, Crabbe and Graham will all be unrestricted free agents this summer. The Hawks have some additional expiring contracts on their roster \u2014 most notably Chandler Parsons and Evan Turner \u2014 who could garner interest in the market, Smith reports .

The Pelicans announced Wednesday that the No. 1 pick is expected to play his first regular-season game on Jan. 22 as the Pelicans host the Spurs . Williamson, who has missed the Pelicans\u2019 first 41 games while recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, will be must-see TV from here on out. But after missing what will be more than half of the season, is there enough time for Williamson to make a serious run at Kia Rookie of the Year? Probably not, especially considering what Ja Morant is doing in Memphis. Morant has been brilliant, helping the Grizzlies become one of the feel-good stories of the season while averaging 18 points and 6.9 assists per game . Morant has dazzled as he\u2019s turned Memphis into a playoff contender while displaying a maturity and confidence unmatched by any other rookie. Tuesday night, Morant had one of his most memorable moments, going toe-to-toe with NBA scoring leader James Harden and sparking Memphis past Houston 121-110 to extend its winning streak to six straight. Morant scored 26 points with eight assists and missed just one shot in one of the biggest games of his young career. \u201cThe doubters said I couldn\u2019t shoot,\u201d Morant told NBA TV\u2019s Dennis Scott afterward. \u201cI\u2019m proving them wrong.\u201d Indeed, Morant continues to prove he is more than just a slasher (more than half of his shots are at the rim), hitting from beyond the arc at a 40.7% clip. On Tuesday, the Rockets sagged off Morant, and the point guard made them pay, hitting 3 of 4 3-point attempts. It was a coming-out party for Morant on NBA TV, but while fans will have plenty of opportunities to check out Zion and the Pelicans on national TV (eight more after his debut), Morant and the Grizzlies have just two more appearances all season. Monday you can catch Morant\u2019s Grizzlies (ironically against the Pelicans) in a notable Martin Luther King Jr. Day game ( 5 p.m. ET, TNT ), then again Feb. 24 in a showdown with the Clippers. Zion will draw the headlines (and casual TV viewers), but Morant remains the real rookie to catch \u2014 on NBA League Pass and in the chase for Kia Rookie of the Year. * * * 1. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies Last week: No. 1 As mentioned, Morant missed just one of his 11 attempts vs. Houston, becoming the first rookie in NBA history to score at least 25 points while handing out eight or more assists and shooting 90% or better from the field. In three games this week, Morant hit at a 58.1% clip and knocked down 50% of his 3-pointers (4-for-8) while averaging 19.7 points and 10.7 assists. 2. Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat Last week: Not ranked After falling out of the Top 5 last week, Nunn returns after another big-time performance. Nunn scored 33 points on 13-for-18 shooting Wednesday to lead Miami to a 106-100 win over the Spurs and help the Heat climb back to 2nd in the East. Nunn was 8-for-8 in the first half (an NBA record for an undrafted rookie) and hit 5 of 7 3-pointers in 31 minutes. It marked Nunn\u2019s fifth straight game scoring in double-digits and capped off a week in which he averaged 21 ppg on 62.8% shooting (43.8% on 3s).  3. Sekou Doumbouya, Detroit Pistons Last week: No. 3 After making a splash into the Ladder last week, Doumbouya kept it up this week, averaging 15 ppg on 62.2% shooting. He capped off his week with possibly his best game yet, scoring a team-high 24 points to help the Pistons surprise the Celtics. He finished 10-for-13 and became the 2nd youngest player (19 years, 23 days) in NBA history to score 24-plus points on 75% shooting or better in a game. The other? Kobe Bryant, who did it in April of 1997. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of the way he\u2019s not scared of match-ups,\u201d said Pistons guard Derrick Rose. \u201cHe don\u2019t care. That\u2019s what the league\u2019s about. No boys allowed.\u201d 4. Jarrett Culver, Minnesota Timberwolves Last week: No. 2 Culver continues to show his growth, finishing the week with a 17-point showing in a 104-99 loss to the Pacers . The No. 6 pick was 8-for-13 from the field (1-for-2 on 3s) while leading Minnesota in scoring for the 2nd time in the last five games. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely been a bright spot through some of these tough endings for us,\u201d coach Ryan Saunders said Wednesday . \u201cHis future is bright. The way he\u2019s been getting his looks on the offensive end. I think he\u2019s been aggressive getting to the basket and then on the defensive end I think he\u2019s shown a lot of growth too.\u201d 5. RJ Barrett, New York Knicks Last week: Not ranked Barrett put up decent numbers this week, and climbs back into the top 5, just edging out Cleveland\u2019s Darius Garland (who had a great week himself). In three games, the No. 3 pick averaged 20.3 ppg, 7.3 rpg and nearly 1.7 spg while shooting 45% overall and 7-for-14 on 3-pointers. Barrett was instrumental in the Knicks\u2019 surprising 124-121 win against Miami on Jan. 12 , scoring 23 points on 7-for-10 shooting. Knicks interim coach Mike Miller likes the progress he\u2019s seeing from the young guard. \u201cI see him growing,\u2019\u2019 Miller said . \u201cEverything he\u2019s doing is trending upward. His energy, defense, everything is trending upward. I don\u2019t see (a rookie wall) at all. He\u2019s very unique with his approach, with his stamina, how he prepares for each game. He\u2019s very mature with his approach.\u2019\u2019 * * * Just missed the cut: Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers Last 4 games (2-2 record): 16.0 ppg, 7.3 apg, 1.7 spg, 44.4% FG, 27.3% 3FG PJ Washington, Charlotte Hornets Last 4 games (0-4 record): 11.3 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.5 apg, 45.5% FG, 53.8% 3FG Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies Last 3 games (3-0 record): 11.0 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 2.7 apg, 1.0 bpg, 52.4% FG Jaxson Hayes, New Orleans Pelicans Last 3 games (2-1 record): 14.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 1.0 bpg, 68.6% FG Michael Porter, Jr., Denver Nuggets Last 2 games (2-0 record): 16.0 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.5 spg, 1.0 bpg, 61.9% FG, 50% 3FG * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Jan. 15 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

Can Jazz keep it rolling? Utah can\u2019t seem to do anything wrong these days as it is in the midst of a 10-game win streak , its longest since the 2017-18 season. The Pelicans had one chance to cool off the Jazz back on Jan. 6 , but couldn\u2019t quite pull that off. Once again, the Pelicans are the hosts ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and face a Jazz team that ranks fifth in scoring since Jan. 1 and nearly has a top-10 defense since then , too. New Orleans rookie Zion Williamson won\u2019t be back for another week , but maybe the good vibes of that news will energize the Pelicans in this game. 2. Bucks, Celtics ready for showdown Of the six losses Milwaukee has amassed this season, Boston was able to hand it one of them ( back on Oct. 30 ). Since then, the Bucks are an NBA-best 34-4 and lead the league in scoring, rebounding, Defensive Rating, Net Rating , Rebound Percentage and Effective Field Goal Percentage. (Whew!) The Celtics need look no further than last night vs. Detroit, when Boston allowed the lowly Pistons to look like the Bucks on offense in a 116-103 loss . Keep an eye on the reserves tonight ( 8 ET, TNT ) as Milwaukee\u2019s group has been surging since Dec. 1 (while Boston\u2019s is getting worse). 3. Struggling Warriors host Nuggets From 2013-14 to 2019-20, the Warriors had at least one streak of nine wins or more in each season. Fast-forward to 2019-20 and they\u2019re in the midst of a nine-game losing streak (and had a seven-game skid earlier, too). The No. 2-seeded Nuggets pay a visit next ( 10:30 ET, TNT ), but they may be a bit thinned tonight in the backcourt. Guard Gary Harris rolled his left ankle against Charlotte on Wednesday and will likely be a game-time decision, while Jamal Murray will miss another game for Denver. The grades are in! When the Bucks and Celtics do play later tonight, it will officially mark the 615th game of the 1,230-game season. That means we\u2019ll be at the actual midway point of 2019-20 and, well, it\u2019s time to grade how everyone is doing. We\u2019ve got our report cards for the Eastern Conference and Western Conference teams, so have a look around and check out what your squad is doing right \u2026 and what it can improve upon."},{"id":29348,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-questionable-vs-magic","date":"2020-01-16","title":"Lakers' Anthony Davis 'getting closer' to return","content":" Entering Wednesday\u2019s game vs. Orlando, the Los Angeles Lakers hadn\u2019t struggled with Anthony Davis out of the lineup. They scored blowout wins against the Dallas Mavericks , Oklahoma City Thunder and Cleveland Cavaliers heading in, all since Davis suffered his gluteus maximus contusion on Jan. 7. Those were the final three games of a nine-game winning streak \u2014 even after the loss to Orlando, they sit at 33-8 , the best record in the Western Conference. Davis pointed out Tuesday that he is clearly on the mend. \u201cI\u2019m getting closer to getting back on the floor with these guys,\u201d Davis said . \u201cBut the last [few] games, it looks like they don\u2019t need me. So kind of taking it slower than usual.\u201d Davis further detailed his injury to reporters on Tuesday, explaining how he\u2019s happy that his injury was not more serious than it could have been. \u201cIt was very painful,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHard for me to walk, obviously. It was pretty tough for me to just roll over on my back and on my side at the initial point of contact. It was tough. I didn\u2019t want any speculation, but I was just praying that it wasn\u2019t anything too serious. \u201cVery relieving knowing that just based on how it felt, a day-to-day thing, [rather] than a fracture or anything like that where you need surgery and you\u2019re out weeks or months or whatever. I\u2019m glad [that my return timeline is] just based on how I feel.\u201d Davis said he hasn\u2019t sprinted since the injury nor has he had any contact drills or 5-on-5 work at practice. As of Thursday he did not fully rule out playing against the Magic, but said he wants to remain cautious as he works on returning. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s getting better and I\u2019m a lot closer than I was three days ago,\u201d Davis said. \u201cMade some more progress today. When I feel like I\u2019m able to get back to my old self and do the moves I\u2019ve always done and be successful at it, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be able to get back on the floor.\u201d Aside from Davis being out, the Lakers will also be without guard Rajon Rondo because he has a right ring finger avulsion. Los Angeles\u2019 nine-game run was one short of tying its season-high of 10 straight victories and marked the fourth time this season the Lakers have won at least seven in a row. Forward Kyle Kuzma, the subject of trade rumors, is averaging 24.3 points over the last three games, including a season-high 36 against the Thunder. Dwight Howard, who finished with 21 points (including his third 3-pointer of the season) and 15 rebounds in 25 minutes against the Cavaliers, averaged 14.3 points and 11.7 rebounds off the bench in those same three games.

New Orleans Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin told reporters Wednesday that Williamson is on track to make his NBA debut then. Williamson\u2019s return would mark his first action since Oct. 13 , and is the culmination of a slow, deliberate rehabilitation process stemming from an Oct. 21 surgery on his right knee . Williamson returned to full-court, five-on-five work in practice with the Pelicans on Jan. 7 . But coach Alvin Gentry and the organization took a non-committal stance about when Williamson would join his teammates on the floor in games. Gentry has stated all along that once Williamson returns, he\u2019ll be on a minutes restriction. However, Griffin told reporters Wednesday that Williamson will not be on a minutes restriction when he returns. His playing time will be determined by how he\u2019s faring on the court. Still, it remains possible when Williamson hits the court against the Spurs, his time could be brief. Either way, Williamson, 19, hasn\u2019t played in a game since an Oct. 13 exhibition victory over the San Antonio Spurs, in which he racked up 22 points to go with 10 rebounds . Williamson said he first started to feel pain in his right knee after New Orleans\u2019 123-114 win in San Antonio. A subsequent MRI exam revealed damage to the meniscus in Williamson\u2019s right knee, and the rookie underwent surgery on Oct. 21, a day before the team\u2019s season-opening road loss to the Toronto Raptors. The team initially pointed to a six-to-eight week time frame for Williamson\u2019s recovery, but it also took a long-term view toward the rookie\u2019s rehabilitation process, before deciding ultimately to bring him along at a slower pace, given his importance to the franchise. The No. 1 overall pick in last year\u2019s Draft , Williamson scored the most points in the preseason by a rookie in the last three seasons when he hit on 12-of-13 shots for 29 points in a Pelicans comeback win over the Chicago Bulls. Williamson averaged 23.3 points per game in four preseason outings while shooting 71.4% and pulling down 6.5 rebounds. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The 7-foot-3 sharpshooter has been out since New Year\u2019s Eve with his knee issue. Porzingis\u2019 recovery was also delayed in part because of an illness as well.

But the Hawks are 9-32, which means Young\u2019s prolific scoring might not even get him to Chicago for a weekend in February. Detroit Pistons center Andre Drummond leads the NBA in rebounds per game (15.7) , offensive rebounds (4.4), defensive rebounds (11.3) and rebound percentage . He recently became only the eighth player in history to amass 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds in six or more consecutive seasons. Of the seven others, six who are eligible for the Hall of Fame all are in. But Drummond might not be participating in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game because his Pistons are 14-27 this season. As for Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine, his 24.5 ppg is the highest of his career . He\u2019s sixth in 3-poiners made , seventh in field goals made and ninth total minutes , while cracking the Top 15 in steals, free throws, free throw attempts and usage. Traditionally, local guys not just make but star on All-Star Sunday. Yet LaVine\u2019s Bulls are tied with the Pistons in the East as coaches start firming up their ballots to select the All-Star reserves. That means LaVine faces an uphill challenge if he\u2019s going to participate in the Game itself rather than one of the All-Star weekend events . Because another tradition is that the coaches \u2014 more than the media, certainly more than the fans \u2014 tend to factor in team success when assessing All-Star worthiness. That seems more than a little misguided, leading not just to Type I errors in the selections (deserving players left off) but Type II errors as well (borderline candidates getting in). This annual debate got batted about on \u201cInside the NBA\u201d as the second fan returns of All-Star voting were released. Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal were trying to weigh \u201cwinning\u201d against a player\u2019s personal stats before bestowing official All-Star status. And then Boston coach Brad Stevens told reporters that it\u2019s an explicit part of his thought process before picking his seven reserves in the East. \u201cI start with a couple things from a statistical standpoint, obviously,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cbut then look at how their teams are playing, if they\u2019ve won or not.\u201d Stevens has had, and has, plenty of company among his peers, who find it harder than fans to overlook a saggy W-L record before \u201crewarding\u201d the best player on a meh team. You play the game to win, right? And what wins in the NBA more than anything else? Stars. Therefore, however faulty the logic, a team cannot have a true star if it isn\u2019t winning. Of course, coaches are the same people who will remind anyone who\u2019ll listen that basketball is about having the best five players. So presumably if you stuck LeBron James on a roster otherwise filled with insurance salesmen and delicatessen countermen, and their team played appropriately to that talent level, the Chosen One shouldn\u2019t get chosen. (Good thing for James that he crushes it at the fans\u2019 ballot box every year, because last season the Lakers were 28-29 at the All-Star break .) Meanwhile, dominant teams like the Milwaukee Bucks are presumed to \u201cneed\u201d a second All-Star. No matter how clear it is that the Bucks are built around one transcendental player and a robust, talented supporting cast. No one wants to begrudge a player like Khris Middleton \u2014 or worker bees before him like Jeff Teague or Wally Szczerbiak \u2014 their day in the All-Star sun. But they were All-Stars because it seemed odd to have multiple reps from teams with lesser records. Should a sidekick get on the marquee ahead of someone who \u2014 with higher quality or healthier teammates, maybe even better coaching \u2014 could easily be vying for a Top-4 seed, team-wise? The answer is right in the title: All- Star Game. So no. Team success gets rewarded with playoff berths. It even factors in varying doses into winning NBA Awards . The standings often matter when considering a serious Kia MVP candidate. Kia Sixth Man and Kia Defensive Player of the Year winners historically come from clubs that finished above or around .500. The Kia Rookie of the Year award often goes to a potential star on a losing team. But that\u2019s baked into the system: it\u2019s hard for a newbie to flip a loser into a winner in one season. Curiously, another award in which a stellar W-L record isn\u2019t necessary is Coach of the Year. Many winners have come from teams that simply improved a lot or exceeded low expectations. It\u2019s hard for a coach to thrive, the argument goes, when the talent level is low, so he must have coached his bleep off. Yeah, well, it\u2019s hard for a star player to lift a team if his partners are young or hurt or just aren\u2019t very good. \u201cA lot of times players get put in situations that aren\u2019t their fault,\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s injuries or the organization is in a rebuild, there are just so many things.\u201d Brooks mentioned Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a smooth power forward who was the No. 3 pick overall in 1996. Abdur-Rahim spent his first five seasons with the Grizzlies during their raggedy Vancouver incarnation. Over his first seven seasons, he averaged 20.7 points and 8.3 rebounds. But his teams in Vancouver and Atlanta were a combined 239 games under .500, and was named an All Star only once. \u201cHe was a \u2018good scorer on a bad team,\u2019\u201d said Brooks, an assistant in Sacramento, where Abdur-Rahim spent his final three seasons from 2005-2008. \u201cThat guy is one of the biggest winners I\u2019ve ever been around. How he prepared, how he talked to younger players, how he communicated with the veteran players and coaches. If he was with an organization that was in a different spot, he might have been a 10-time All Star.\u201d Stevens did go on to cite as his tiebreaker in choosing All-Star reserves (and by rule not voting for any Celtics) the \u201cfear factor when we\u2019re getting ready to play against\u201d a potential pick\u2019s team. Well, nobody gets game-planned against more thoroughly than that lone star on a struggling squad. The All-Star Game is an individual showcase. Fans deserve to see Young, Drummond and (mostly for the local hook) LaVine, with no snub intended for a No. 2 star on a winning team. The same applies to Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal, who did something coaches should value when he re-upped with a rebuilding team instead of fleeing. The same can be said for the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 Brandon Ingram and Phoenix Suns\u2019 Devin Booker, who have established themselves among the game\u2019s bright young stars ahead of schedule for their developing teams. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d said Brooks, who can\u2019t vote for Beal but has no doubt his guy should be in Chicago next month. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the 12 best players in the conference, you should be voted in as one of the All Stars.\u201d Fortunately\/unfortunately, injuries typically rear up by the middle of February. The commissioner\u2019s office then names replacement players, not necessarily bound by vote totals. That ought to improve LaVine\u2019s chances in particular, if the NBA likes the idea of a Bulls player cavorting in the city\u2019s first All-Star Game since 1988 with Michael Jordan . That 1987-88 season was the Bulls\u2019 fourth with Jordan, the first in which they cracked .500 . Probably some stubborn coach then argued he shouldn\u2019t have been an All-Star his first three years, either, cuz of \u201cwinning.\u201d Good luck finding the guy willing to admit it. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Can Lakers keep rolling without Davis? It seems that not even an injury to one of the Lakers\u2019 top players can keep them from rolling along. Although Anthony Davis has missed the last three games recovering from his tailbone injury, the Lakers haven\u2019t looked worse for the wear. They\u2019re 3-0 in that stretch and as the Magic visit tonight ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ), Davis will again be questionable. However, reserves such as Kyle Kuzma and Dwight Howard have stepped up nicely in Davis\u2019 absence and, of course, LeBron James continues to dominate. Keep an eye on the defenses in this one, though: the Lakers are No. 3 in Defensive Rating , while the Magic aren\u2019t far behind (No. 5). 2. Back-to-back tests for Nets Kyrie Irving was doing all kinds of Kyrie Irving-type things last night vs. the Jazz, but his Nets had no answer for Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert and Co. in a 118-107 loss . There\u2019s no rest for the weary, though, as Brooklyn will host the Philadelphia 76ers ( 7 ET, ESPN ) in a showdown of Eastern Conference teams that have had their struggles lately. The Sixers have lost six of their last eight games, including a 101-95 defeat in Indiana that saw the Pacers rally late to win. In fact, five of the Sixers\u2019 last six losses have come against teams over .500 (Heat, Pacers, Rockets, Mavericks, Pacers), so they\u2019re looking to get back on track as well. 3. A big reinforcement for Raptors Toronto is the No. 4 team in the East this morning, but is just 2 1\/2 games behind the Boston Celtics for the No. 2 spot. That the Raptors have held things together given their myriad of injuries has been remarkable. Things are looking up even moreso for them in their trip to Oklahoma City ( 8 ET, League Pass ) as center Marc Gasol is planning to suit up . Gasol hasn\u2019t played since suffering a hamstring injury in a win against Detroit . The 34-year-old has started all 27 games he\u2019s played in, averaging 6.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg and 3.4 apg this season. 4. Westbrook back as Blazers host Rockets Memphis Grizzlies rookie Ja Morant made the Houston Rockets and their backcourt look just plain silly in a 121-110 loss on Tuesday . Morant did all of his damage while not facing Russell Westbrook, who missed the game for rest reasons. Westbrook will be back in the mix, though, as Houston heads to Portland ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) and Houston tries to keep pace in a changing West race . Injuries have Portland seven games under .500 at the season\u2019s halfway point, but the big game Anthony Tolliver provided in a win vs. Charlotte gave the Blazers signs of life on their bench. 5. On this date: You traded Wilt?! In one of the biggest trades in NBA history, the San Francisco Warriors, in the middle of a then league record 17-game losing streak, traded Wilt Chamberlain on Jan. 15, 1965 to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and cash. In his 3 1\/2 seasons with the Sixers, Chamberlain won an NBA title (1967), three NBA MVPs and was an All-Star each season. Dierking, Shaffer and Neumann, meanwhile, were mostly role players during their remaining NBA years."},{"id":29440,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/klay-thompson-unsure-when-hell-return","date":"2020-01-15","title":"Klay Thompson unsure when he'll return to court","content":"The Golden State Warriors have played most of this season without household names Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in the mix. Since suffering a torn ACL in his left knee injury in Game 6 of The 2019 Finals, Thompson was expected to be out until at least the All-Star break . Thompson spoke with the media on Tuesday night during the Warriors\u2019 124-97 loss to the Mavericks, explaining that his rehabilitation process is going well, but that a return this season remains unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s going great,\u201d Thompson said during Tuesday\u2019s game against the Dallas Mavericks . \u201cI mean, at least my suits are well tailored. And it\u2019s fun to watch these guys battle. Obviously, I wish I could be out there. It\u2019s been a long process. I haven\u2019t stopped working since the third day after Game 6 of the 2019 Finals. You might not see me a lot, but I\u2019m working. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come this season, I would love to get out there. \u201cI appreciate the Warrior fans showing up every night in Chase [Center], just a testament to the fan base we have. They know it\u2019s been a tough season, but they know the future\u2019s bright \u2014 so it\u2019s actually nice to be here. I haven\u2019t seen you guys [media] in a long time. You\u2019re welcome for me being here today. I just kind of miss \u2014 I know it\u2019s a tough part of the season. It\u2019s very rare for me not to be grinding through it with them, but I\u2019m trying to make sure this type of injury never happens to me again, so I\u2019ll be very patient because I want to play at a high level \u2019til my late 30s.\u201d Per ESPN\u2019s Nick Friedell , there has always been some hope that Thompson would suit up this season. However, the team does not want to risk further injury to a player they signed to a max contract last summer and is critical to the next phase of success for Golden State. In late October, coach Steve Kerr said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Thompson would suit up at all this season. Thompson, per Friedell, has spent some time rehabbing in Los Angeles and is starting to be around the Warriors\u2019 practice facility more as his rehab ramps up. He has also been shooting with teammates after practices as well. \u201cMore than anything it just feels good to see him out there,\u201d Kerr said before Tuesday\u2019s game, per Friedell. \u201cAnd for him to feel it, like he\u2019s actually closer. Even though he\u2019s still a ways from being out on the floor, he\u2019s so far along now compared to when this first started. So he\u2019s pretty far down the path, so I think he\u2019s starting to feel that. The routine is changing now. He\u2019s on the court a lot more, and I\u2019m asking him to be around our team a lot more. Both Steph [Curry] and Klay I\u2019ve talked to about starting to be engaged and involved with the group. The new players need to get to know those guys and vice versa. And they give our young group some confidence just with their presence. So I think that\u2019s all part of the next step here for both Steph and Klay.\u201d While Thompson has not played in a game this season, Curry did not fare much better in 2019-20. He was injured in the Warriors\u2019 fourth game , suffering a broken left hand in the third quarter of a 121-110 loss to the Phoenix Suns. He had surgery on the injury in early November and has been out of the lineup ever since. After making the last five Finals, the Warriors have struggled this season because of those injuries \u2014 and others \u2014 to their revamped roster. At 9-33, Golden State has the NBA\u2019s worst record , having lost nine straight and 14 of its last 18 games overall. Thompson will have his No. 1 jersey retired at Washington State on Saturday, traveling on owner Joe Lacob\u2019s private plane to Pullman, Wash., for the halftime ceremony when the Cougars host Oregon State. \u201dI haven\u2019t been back in about five years,\u201d Thompson said. \u201dTo go back and see the people I really grew up with, the community that really embraced me, it\u2019s very nostalgic and it\u2019s just really cool because that was a dream of mine leaving Pullman. I didn\u2019t think it would ever come true and it did, so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d Warriors forward Draymond Green recently had his jersey retired at Michigan State . Curry will be joining Thompson in Washington for the ceremony, which is something that delights Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool,\u201d Thompson said of Curry\u2019s attending. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot of highs together. A lot of lows. We\u2019ve played at the highest level of the game as far as the NBA Finals and international competition. And he\u2019s been my longest-tenured teammate, so I appreciate him coming. One day maybe I\u2019ll make it out to Davidson, too, if he got to go get that degree.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":29411,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/derrick-rose-fined-official-release","date":"2020-01-14","title":"Derrick Rose fined $25K for throwing pen into stands","content":"NEW YORK , Jan. 14, 2020 \u2013 Detroit Pistons guard Derrick Rose has been fined $25,000 for throwing a pen across the court and into the spectator stands, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

"},{"id":29451,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mentorship-month-nba-learning-veterans","date":"2020-01-14","title":"How young NBA players find motivation through their veteran teammates","content":" Kyle Korver leaned against a locker laughing, almost marveling at an improbable journey trekked over 17 years in the league with six different teams. Former All-Star (2015) and NBA Sportsmanship Award winner (2015), Korver knows he didn\u2019t make it here all alone. That\u2019s why this month \u2014 National Mentoring Month \u2014 resonates with the Milwaukee Bucks forward as well as several other players around the NBA. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to play in the NBA, and if you get a bunch of years in this league, there\u2019s a responsibility in that of paying it forward, of showing young guys how to work, how to be a pro,\u201d Korver explained to NBA.com. \u201cThat just kind of comes with age, and hopefully we\u2019re doing that in every phase of life, not just basketball.\u201d The month of January serves as National Mentoring Month, and since 2014 the NBA has partnered with MENTOR in an effort to raise awareness about the positive power of mentoring the youth in communities all over the country. In the smaller NBA world, players cycle in and out of the league every year at a breakneck pace. The ones who stick around for a long time almost universally credit older veteran teammates with helping them to navigate the pitfalls of the NBA \u2014 both on and off the court \u2014 while also teaching the nuances of what it takes to develop into a true professional. That doesn\u2019t mean vets are rolling out the red carpet to younger players, who might ultimately take their jobs. That\u2019s why Korver laughs reminiscing back to his relationship with former Philadelphia 76ers teammate Aaron McKie, who was 31 years old and in his 10th season when Korver entered the league as a 22-year-old rookie.  \u201cAaron McKie was my guy in Philly my first few years,\u201d Korver said. \u201cCertain guys take pride in taking the young guys under their wing and showing them the ropes, showing them how to be a pro. He was the first guy that I really like felt he was for me\u2026 until we got on the practice court. Then, he wouldn\u2019t let me sub in for him, and he would go at me because he didn\u2019t want me to take his minutes, right? But it was this really good, healthy combo of showing me how to work, showing me how to be a pro, but also being like, \u2018Hey, but I\u2019m not giving you my job.\u2019 It was a really good balance of that.\u201d Allen Iverson was also \u201ca big part of my early career,\u201d Korver added. \u201cHe did a great job of giving me confidence and building me up.\u201d In San Antonio, where future Hall of Famer Tim Duncan served as the driving factor in establishing the franchise\u2019s current culture of selflessness, Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge are carrying the legacy forward, despite not receiving the mentorship they\u2019ve grown accustomed to providing. Both Mills and Aldridge started off their careers with the Portland Trail Blazers, before joining the Spurs. \u201cI do it now, but really didn\u2019t have [mentorship from veterans] when I came into the league,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cI came to a team that turned the page pretty quickly. We were young. Z-Bo (Zach Randolph) and all those guys left. So, we had to kind of learn through trial and error in the fire. I really didn\u2019t have anyone to kind of take me under their wing and tell me, \u2018This is what you do.\u2019\u201d Mills felt the same way over his first two seasons in the NBA with the Blazers. But then it all changed during the 2011-12 season, when Mills signed with the Spurs and entered a locker room featuring three future Hall of Famers in Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I really got that until I got here to San Antonio, and I guess I didn\u2019t really understand what it takes to be a professional and all those things that you\u2019d get from a veteran,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI no doubt found that here and really dug into it. I think Timmy, Tony, Manu, all those guys had the same impact, but in their own way because all three of them were different with the way they did it. Timmy led by example. Manu did it in a way of talking about things away from the court, and Tony mentored me a little bit more on the court. I could dive into depth with all of those three guys. But then at the same time, you had guys like Matt Bonner even to an extent. He was that professional veteran that had been around for so long that he just knew what to do to get himself ready for a game. I just walked into an environment in San Antonio where I got that from so many different angles, and I just tried to soak it up as much as I could.\u201d Two teams, and a championship removed from an eight-year tenure with the Spurs that also featured a title in 2013-14, Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Danny Green described a similar experience in San Antonio learning from Ginobili. \u201cFrom Day 1, I tried to be a sponge and take in everything he\u2019s done,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe makes it look so easy, but it\u2019s not easy. I [try] to take the things he\u2019s done and try to add it to my game and try to find certain areas within the games to take advantage of or to try to find extra points here or defensive angles that he takes to be successful. He was kind of like the teacher of the group, the professor, the problem solver, the guy that always throws out random scenarios, a mathematician. He\u2019s very informed, always reading up, always wanting to learn something, always trying to teach something, random facts. He\u2019s a very high I.Q. guy on the court and off the court.\u201d Because of their radically different experiences from Portland to San Antonio, both Mills and Aldridge now feel it\u2019s important to take on mentorship roles with the current Spurs. Spurs guard Bryn Forbes said that on his first day with the team, Mills pulled him aside, \u201cand told me that if I needed anything you can just come to me.\u201d Undrafted out of Michigan State in 2016-17, Forbes said he\u2019s also received plenty of mentorship from Ginobili and Rudy Gay. \u201cWhen you see new guys, young guys, and you see the determination on their faces,\u201d Mills said before pausing. \u201cEven before the determination, you see those question marks going on in their heads when they first walk through that door. They just don\u2019t know what to expect from everyone else. So, the first thing you can say to someone is, \u2018If you need help, I\u2019m here. Let me know because I\u2019ve been in your shoes. Whatever this is, I can help you through to get you on your path.\u2019 That can definitely help that first few weeks, months even. It can be intimidating if you come in and you\u2019re not the guy.\u201d Philadelphia center Al Horford understands that situation intimately, despite actually being \u2018the guy\u2019 Mills described, as the No. 3 overall pick of the Atlanta Hawks in the 2007 NBA Draft.  \u201cZaza Pachulia and Mike Bibby were the two guys for me, as well as Anthony Johnson. Those were the guys I leaned on in those early days,\u201d Horford said. \u201cZaza was just very professional, really took care of himself well, and [I learned] just from his game and watching him how he operated, how he played. Mike Bibby was a huge help for me on the court, giving me advice pick-and-roll wise, where to get my shots, things to do. He was instrumental in that role.  \u201cI was very lucky. I had a lot of veterans around me. It was very influential. You\u2019re coming in and you\u2019re learning how to be a pro, how to do it the right way. Those guys played for a lot of years in the NBA. There are always a lot of guys that have potential, but to make it a certain amount of years in the league, it takes more than just potential. You have to be professional, you have to be a good teammate, do things the right way. So now, any chance I get to talk to younger guys, I do it.\u201d Korver\u2019s current teammate, Eric Bledsoe, says he does, too. Bledsoe spent his first three years in the NBA with the LA Clippers as a first-round pick out of Kentucky. In L.A., Bledsoe played with Chris Paul, Baron Davis, and Mo Williams, as well as Grant Hill, Chauncey Billups, Lamar Odom and Caron Butler. Bledsoe\u2019s eyes widen when he describes the impact those veterans made on his career. \u201cI had some great vets to learn from,\u201d Bledsoe told NBA.com. \u201cThat Clippers team was stacked with a bunch of Hall of Famers. Man, I learned a lot from every one of those guys. But the biggest thing I got from every one of those guys was to just be patient. They\u2019d all tell me to be patient because my time was going to come.\u201d It\u2019s here now, and Bledsoe is sharing the same advice with current teammates Donte DiVincenzo and Sterling Brown. DiVincenzo is in his second year in the NBA, while Brown is in his third. \u201cI talk to them both all the time,\u201d said Bledsoe, now in his 10th season. \u201cSterling doesn\u2019t get a lot of playing [time] right now. He\u2019s frustrated right now, but I was in the same position he was in just hungry to play. The guys I came up with would always tell me that no matter if we\u2019re up or down, if you go in, get in there and play hard. But just know that sometimes you just have to be patient and wait your turn.\u201d Now in his 14th season in the NBA, Gay experienced a similar situation as a rookie in Memphis.  Damon Stoudamire was 33 in his 12th NBA season and on his third team when Gay, just 20 at the time, joined the Grizzlies. Stoudamire immediately took on a mentorship role for Gay, who was playing behind Eddie Jones at the time. Through that experience, Gay now sees an important responsibility in growing up the next generation of NBA players. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a little bit of knowledge, it\u2019s your responsibility to pass that on however you can, especially when you\u2019re trying to win, you\u2019re on a team with young players and you want them to progress. You\u2019ve got to speak up and help them.\u201d Just like we all need to do in helping to shape America\u2019s youth. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

While Westbrook is getting a rest tonight , he\u2019ll get another glimpse at Memphis rookie sensation Ja Morant. It\u2019s not often you get a glimpse of yourself in action the way Westbrook and Morant will tonight when the streaking Grizzlies host the Rockets at FedEx Forum. But that\u2019s exactly what both players will experience in this instance. Morant started drawing comparisons to Westbrook while he was in college \u2014 an ultra-athletic point guard who plays at a breakneck pace while attacking the rim. To date, he\u2019s done nothing to discourage those lofty comparisons. Memphis is 7-2 since Christmas, much of which is due to the play of Morant during that stretch. He\u2019s piling up highlights along the way that surely remind Westbrook of his younger self, not that he still isn\u2019t one of the league\u2019s most explosive players. Tonight\u2019s game also provides viewers an interesting glimpse at the Kia MVP past (Westbrook won the award in 2017 ), present (James Harden won in 2018 and is in the thick of this chase ) and perhaps its future (Morant leads the Kia Rookie Ladder and could be a Kia MVP candidate sooner than later). The praise for Morant\u2019s game has been universal. His impact in Memphis, where expectations for this season didn\u2019t necessarily include housing a playoff contender, is undeniable. Morant and second-year forward Jaren Jackson Jr. are foundational pieces for the franchise as it makes an official transition from its \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d past to whatever this new and wildly exciting era becomes. \u201cI think he\u2019s exceeded everyone else\u2019s expectations,\u201d Jackson said of his teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s a special talent. He moves without the ball, gets back on defense, set screens and gets the ball to guys when they\u2019re open.\u201d * * * Another LeBron milestone:  LeBron James collected his latest stats feat in the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 win over his old Cleveland team, passing Isiah Thomas for eighth on the NBA\u2019s all-time assists list . Just add that one to the long list of milestones for LeBron, an unabashed student of the game, will add many more to this list before he\u2019s done playing in the NBA. Gilgeous-Alexander delivers:  Luka Doncic isn\u2019t the only youngster in the league doing things we haven\u2019t seen in ages. Did you see the line Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put together Monday night in a Oklahoma City\u2019s win over over Minnesota? His 20 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists made him the youngest player (21 years, 185 days), per Elias Sports, to have a 20-20-10 game. The previous youngest was Maurice Stokes (22 years, 211 days) who had 26 points, 38 rebounds and 12 assists for the Rochester Royals on Jan. 14, 1956 (one day shy of exactly 64 years ago). Player(s) of the Week: E xcellent work from both Philadelphia\u2019s Josh Richardson and San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan (the author of this Dunk of the Year offering below) on to earn Player of the Week honors. DeRozan slid into the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder last week, ahead of this honor. I guess you could say we saw this coming. No Sleep Zone: I feel you Zion Williamson. We\u2019ve all been there before. Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . From: Felice Francario Jan. 7, 2020, 7:07 p.m. I am a big fan of your MVP Ladder. I usually agree with most of your rankings, but I completely disagree with having Anthony Davis over LeBron James. Just by watching a couple of the most recent Lakers games, I noticed that everytime LeBron is off the floor they look horrible. The analytics support the eye test. When LeBron is on the floor : +12.7 net rating. When Davis is on the floor : +7.4 net rating When LeBron is off the floor : -1.5 net rating. When Davis is off the floor : + 10.5 net rating. That means that the Lakers without LeBron James have a worse net rating than the Washington Wizards (-4.1 net rating). Meanwhile Without Anthony Davis, the Lakers still have a better net rating than the Clippers (+5.9 net rating). My Kia MVP list: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Luka Doncic 5. Anthony Davis For now, I am putting Harden over LeBron, since he is averaging nearly 40 points which can\u2019t be ignored. If the Lakers continue with this win pace I will move LeBron up on my list. * * * My response:  These are compelling numbers Felice, I appreciate you taking the time to share them. One thing I\u2019d point out about the LeBron-AD on and off the floor ratings. As the primary ball handler for the Lakers LeBron is always going to have a more significant impact on the Lakers\u2019 bottom line. It\u2019s not like AD takes over as the primary ball handler\/decision maker when he\u2019s on the floor without LeBron. From: Ethan Jha Jan. 7, 2020 | 5:47 p.m. I personally believe that this past week\u2019s MVP ladder was good, such as Giannis at No. 1. But, there were a few things I should note. For example, I think James Harden should be higher than Luka Doncic because of his CRAZY scoring while also averaging 7.5 assists per game. If he was averaging less assists, I guarantee he would be averaging at least 40 ppg. In the meantime, Luka is lower in points than Harden. While he may be averaging a near-triple-double, he also missed some time, and the Mavs have dropped in the West, from the second to the sixth seed \u2014 two spots lower than the Rockets. I also want to talk about AD and LeBron, because I believe that LeBron should be higher than AD because. In my opinion, he is worth more to the Lakers than AD right now. They are in first place in the Western Conference, and I have a good feeling that it will stay like that. However, I believe that if you take AD off that team, they will still be a top 5 team in the West, but not in a place to win the championship. If you take LeBron off the Lakers, they essentially become the Pelicans for the last five years. This is why I think LeBron should be higher than AD. I also think he should be higher than Luka and Harden because I believe that they are all playing at about the same level, but look at the rankings. The Lakers are first in the West, the Rockets are fourth and the Mavs are sixth. Now, like I said earlier, being in first place is definitely due in part to AD. But I also said that LeBron is more valuable to them, just like how Luka is more valuable to the Mavs than Kristaps and how Harden is more valuable to the Rockets than Russell Westbrook. It all cancels out and we\u2019re left with the standings, and the Lakers are the highest. With that being said, here\u2019s my Top 5 MVP Ladder: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Anthony Davis Besides the MVP Ladder, I also had a thought about the All-Star Game, specifically the All-Star draft and who is drafted. I believe that it was a fantastic idea by Adam Silver to have two special spots for Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki. I personally believe that the league should do that every year, which is why, for this year, if they do have a special draft for soon-to-be-retired players, I believe they should do Vince Carter and Carmelo Anthony. This is because Carter is retiring this season, and he definitely will be a Hall of Famer, so it is a perfect fit. For Melo, however, he hasn\u2019t said he is retiring this year. If he does, at least this will be a way to respect him for all he\u2019s done for the league as he is also a future Hall of Famer. Either way, give me your thoughts on all of this, and thank you for reading this. Have a great day! * * * My response: Seriously Ethan, this is more homework than I have time to do. I do want to address your point about bringing retiring stars to All-Star weekend. I agree it would be cool to see Vince Carter in Chicago. I wonder if someone could entice him to participate in the Slam Dunk contest \u2026 just for kicks. As for Carmelo, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s retiring anytime soon \u2014 not after what I\u2019ve seen of him this season. I think he plays another year or more. But you are right, it is the perfect way to honor retiring future Hall of Famers, celebrating them during All-Star weekend. Great call. From: Hollis Pettway Jan. 7, 2020 | 5:10 p.m. I have decided to compiled a serious MVP list for your review: 1. James Harden 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LeBron James 4. Luka Doncic 5. Nikola Jokic With respect to the seemingly countless factors upon which the MVP decision is usually made, these selections are based on certain changes to those perimeters. I looked at this season\u2019s accomplishments only, with no consideration for past regular or postseason accomplishments\/shortfalls. This is, after all, a regular season award, right? I feel the player\u2019s value to his team is paramount and a factor that could only be calculated based on the average regular-season points total for which the player is responsible. I also tried to limit the feel-good narrative that often has nothing to do with actual team value (box office totals not withstanding). For me, this approach helps to mitigate the sense of a scattershot approach to the whole thing. Your thoughts? * * * My response: Hollis, my man, I appreciate you coming back with your own top five. And yes indeed, the Kia MVP is strictly a regular season award. There\u2019s another MVP trophy you can earn after The Finals. And I have no problem with the \u201cfeel-good narrative\u201d playing a huge role in this debate. It often has plenty to do with actual team value. Don\u2019t sleep on the narrative. It\u2019s a huge part of this process for many voters. From: Anthony Brown Jan. 7, 2020 | 3:57 p.m. I understand your points in regard to Giannis, but the defense of James Harden this year sounds like a bail out. He\u2019s not a lock-down defender, but great offensive players are going past him this year. And, who stops great offensive players anyway?! I believe you have Luka too high on the board. He should be top 5 but not in the top 3 and we all know why he is a leading All-Star vote-getter . He\u2019s not the best in Texas, much less in the NBA. Everyone has so much to say about Harden in the playoffs, but for three consecutive years Harden has been the best player in the league. It\u2019s crazy: how a man can get double teamed every game averaging almost 40 points and not be one or two on the list today? Seriously, Houston is 3 or 4 in the West today. The excuse last year wasn\u2019t fair to Harden when he was responsible for bringing his team from the bottom to the No. 4 seed in the West. * * * My response: I have no interest in the instigation of some Kia MVP civil war in Texas, Anthony. And as you\u2019ve likely seen by now, James Harden moved ahead of Luka in the latest Kia MVP Ladder. I\u2019ll defer to you (and my main man Michael C. Wright of NBA.com) on all other matters in Texas, if that will keep everyone down there calm. I\u2019m trying to increase the peace in 2020. From: Zachary Pinney Jan. 7, 2020 | 2:06 p.m. I think it\u2019s about time we define what Most Valuable Player really means. A lot of people take it as the best player in the game. We should set aside a new award, the NBA\u2019s best player award, from the MVP. There are some players, that if they didn\u2019t play for the team they play for, that would change the whole outlook of the team and what they stand for. Take reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert off the Utah Jazz and what do you get? A defense that falters because people don\u2019t look at the effect of having Gobert on your team. He is the NBA\u2019s best shot-altering force. Players struggle scoring against him. If Gobert is not on the Jazz, the Jazz wouldn\u2019t win as much. People think it\u2019s all about offense, but the defense means a lot. Rudy Gobert should be an All-Star and an MVP because of his game-changing defense. We know Donovan Mitchell is very good( we could flip the script: who are the Jazz without the scoring punch of Mitchell?), but when we talk about valuable, you need a defensive-minded person like Gobert. Take LeBron out and you still have Anthony Davis. Take Kawhi out and Paul George is still there. Take Giannis out and the Bucks\u2019 outlook is totally different. Take Gobert out, and you no longer have a team that relies on its defense to win games. * * * My response: That\u2019s an original take on the MVP conversation that I honestly haven\u2019t heard much of, Zachary. But you raise some great points. And Gobert is a great example of the dilemma all voters face. Gobert wins Defensive Player of the Year but is conveniently left out of most MVP lists. There\u2019s a reason we connect offensive-minded players or guys who can do it all with the MVP award, and it\u2019s done across all sports really. Even when we know great defense wins championships, we tend to be offensive-minded with MVP or Player of the Year honors. From: Aleksandar Predojevic Jan. 7, 2020 | 2:05 p.m. Your top three of Giannis, Luka and Harden, which I do agree is the top 3 at this point in time. But, do you think Harden has the chance of dethroning Giannis at the top of the list? I mean you can argue he goes to the free throw line a lot, to which he does, however Giannis does have more free-throws per drive than any other player in the league. If Harden were to go on a scoring tear where he has another three to four 60-point games to bring his scoring average to 40 ppg (all while maintaining his current efficiency) and leads his team to 50 wins, would you put him at No. 1? I don\u2019t think Luka will maintain his unbelievable play toward the back end of this season as I think he\u2019s too young and not used to being able to maintain this level of play. I also don\u2019t think the Mavs will be able to continue this hot streak they\u2019re on, so I\u2019ve essentially taken him out of the equation. If Harden were to have a 40\/6\/8 season with two steals per game and the Rockets go 53-28, would that outweight Giannis at, say, 29\/12\/5 with a 60-22 mark? I personally think it should. Then, of course, there\u2019s LeBron, who could just finish with 26\/8\/11 and also have 60-plus wins. Would that over rank those two guys? Or would the help of Davis put him out of contention? Jimmy Butler may not be having a fantastic statistical season. But if the Heat maintained their incredible play, would that put him in contention? If Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets dethroned the Lakers atop the Western Conference (and he\u2019s at 22\/10\/8), would that make him an MVP candidate? And if by some miracle the Pistons were able to finish in a No. 7 or 8 spot, would that put Andre Drummond in contention? Who do you think will continue their amazing play for the rest of this season and who do you think will drop off ? * * * My response: I\u2019ve got to keep it real with you Aleks, I don\u2019t see Harden or anyone overtaking Giannis without a significant spike in their play or a Giannis doing something drastically different this season. If you\u2019re going to catch and pass him, you gotta go off on both ends of the floor, because Giannis is leading the pack with a comprehensive game. You better match that two-way dominance, if you can. From: Sebastian Corsello Jan. 7, 2020 | 1:47 p.m. If you base MVP on the most significant impact, I think it has to be quite a strong case for Giannis to be the front-runner. Although the season is not even half way done yet, Giannis is putting up the greatest PER in NBA history. I do see the reasoning behind why some may think that Harden deserves it due to his incredible offensive season. But if you look at per 36 numbers , Giannis is only averaging 1.6 points less and just 0.7 assists less than Harden \u2026 while also leading his team to the NBA\u2019s best record. Although Doncic is putting up ridiculous numbers and achieving things that no one his age has ever done before, a don\u2019t believe a player on a non-Top 3-seeded team should be considered in the MVP race. LeBron and AD, I think, have been ridiculously good. Come playoff time I think they will be almost unstoppable, but I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a scenario where two superstars of their talent could both be seriously contending for an MVP. My MVP list right now is: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Luka Doncic 5. Anthony Davis 6. Jimmy Butler 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Kemba Walker 9. Pascal Siakam 10. Nikola Jokic Just curious on your thoughts about this and how much you agree with it given your deep understanding for the game. * * * My response: Seems pretty obvious to me, Sebastian. You\u2019ve taken a rather unbiased and quite logical approach to your evaluation of the current MVP landscape. It\u2019s not as easy to do when you have a rooting interest. Folks assume you have an agenda all the time, I know. But that\u2019s not the case for me, nor has it ever been. Your thorough analysis makes nothing but good sense to me. From: Wyatt Kelly Jan. 7, 2020 | 8:38 p.m. I\u2019m a massive fan of your MVP ladder, but I really believe LeBron should be No. 2. He has been playing a whole new brand of basketball as he isn\u2019t just focusing on offense he\u2019s playing defense and showing off his playmaking ability. Surely you will consider putting him at No. 2 \u2014 and maybe even No. 1 \u2014 in future. And on top of that, he is 35 and has played 17 seasons! Here is my MVP ladder:1 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Luka Doncic 4. Anthony Davis 5. James Harden 6. Joel Embiid 7. Kemba Walker 8. Donovan Mitchell 9. Pascal Siakam 10. Damian Lillard Honorable mentions: Kawhi Leonard, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal And will Lakers win the championship? * * * My response: We\u2019ve got you down for LeBron and Lakers, Wyatt. No going back now. You\u2019ve put it out there and we\u2019re keeping track here at MVP headquarters.  From: Nicholas Fulwiler Jan. 8, 2020 | 12:56 p.m. I\u2019m so sick of hearing about James Harden in this race. Every year it\u2019s the same thing. Yeah, he scores the ball at am amazing clip and, yeah, no one can guard him. Cool. So what? The Most Valuable Player Award should go to the Most Valuable Player. Not the player who scores the most. Who cares how many points and individual scores if their team can\u2019t win?! It\u2019s been brought up that there is no standard for judging this race and everyone has their own unique set of values. But, yo, can\u2019t we agree that the MVP award is about more that putting the ball through the hoop? In response to the second published letter this week (from Doreynoldstx): James Harden playing \u201crespectable\u201d defense doesn\u2019t cut it. Defense is half the game. If you\u2019re not a top defender, you shouldn\u2019t be considered for MVP. There\u2019s an award for the highest scorer in the league. Harden can have that and another early exit from the playoffs. Let\u2019s talk about Harden in MVP context when (if?) he starts putting in effort on both ends of the floor. * * * My response: Nick, my friend, we\u2019re supposed to be working on some things to kick off 2020. So don\u2019t be so hard on the rest of the folks in our community here. We might fight every now and then, but we\u2019re a Kia Race to the MVP Ladder family. And yes, I think we should all agree the award is about more than just who scores the most points. If we start there, I think everything else falls into place as we continue the never-ending debate. From: Jackson Medilien Jan. 8, 2020 | 8:23 p.m. I\u2019ve been following the NBA for four seasons now and I would like, for the first time, to manifest my opinion. According to me, LeBron should have won the MVP award every season except for last year. He is the one that brings the money to the NBA and all the sports show around the NBA. His name is attached to every headline either to criticize or praise him, but most of the time it is critics that are railing on his name. This year, he is again the one running the offense for the Lakers. OK, yes, Davis scores a bunch, but this is the way the offense is constructed. Most of the baskets that count \u2014 the ones that give the lead or change the dynamic of the game \u2014 come from LeBron. This guy must be at least at the second place on the MVP ladder. You are disrespecting Giannis\u2019 teammates by saying than he is alone, because he is not. He has the Lopez brothers, two guys trained by LeBron in George Hill and Kyle Korver, while LeBron has nobody consistent except for AD. * * * My response: Some people have made similar arguments about other players in the past, Jackson. Michael Jordan should have eight or nine straight MVPs if you let some of his most passionate fans tell it. So I\u2019m not here to tell you that you are wrong. From: Jonathan George Jan. 10, 2020 | 10:23 a.m. I am a 13-year-old Denver Nuggets fan and I feel like Nikola Jokic should win MVP. He is averaging about 20 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and a steal on 50% from the field, while leading his team to the second-best record in the West. He has the most game-winning shots under 10 seconds since last year and is first among centers in real plus-minus with 4.59. Out of the whole league, Jokic is seventh in RPM trailing players like LeBron James, James Harden and others. Last season, he single-handedly carried his team to the playoffs. Jokic was a monster in the playoffs, getting triple-doubles and posting insane stats. He is one of the clutch players in the NBA, and he is a really good post-up player. * * * My response: Keep crunching those numbers, Jonathan. I\u2019ve been trying to find a young John Schuhmann (NBA.com\u2019s analytics guru) to replace that snarky old man. You\u2019re just the man for the job. Jokic was outstanding last season, the somewhat reluctant headliner for one of the best teams in the league. No one can dispute that. And there are strong arguments made on the regular that suggest he, and not Joel Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns, is the best big man in basketball. From: Ryan Tretsky Jan. 12, 2020 | 2:36 a.m. Do you think Russell Westbrook\u2019s overall improvement on offense from the beginning of the season can make him a viable MVP candidate by the end of the year if he keeps it up? It seems that he really is improving everywhere (except for 3-point shooting) since the beginning of the season. * * * My response: If he keeps it up Ryan, yes, I think Russ can play his way into the MVP conversation. But even if he does, it would be hard to see him supplant James Harden as the Rockets\u2019 most viable candidate for MVP. It\u2019s Harden\u2019s team and the voters understand that. Russ is certainly capable of making things interesting, though, provided he continues to play as well as he has recently. From: Nethul Maddumage Jan. 12, 2020 | 11:28 a.m. Personally, I think that Donovan Mitchell should be higher in the list as he has been playing out of his mind. The Jazz superstar has averaged 22 points, 5.9 assists and 3.5 rebounds during the last eight games and his production also propelled the Jazz to a 10-game win streak. With that winning streak, the Jazz have been climbing the West standings and are now the No. 3 seed. Mitchell has proven himself to be a perennial All-Star that can also be the cornerstone of an organization. All this production and accolades within just the first three seasons of his career. He has proven to be the player the Jazz thought he was when they drafted him and has even surpassed those expectations by showing glimpses of being more than that. * * * My response: I\u2019m not here to argue with you, Nethul. You don\u2019t seem like there is any way you could be convinced of anything else, so I won\u2019t waste any time on that. Donovan Mitchell is indeed where he belongs in the Kia MVP mix, with plenty of chances to climb over the next few months. From: Richard Udoh Jan. 12, 2020 | 2:43p.m. As noted by advanced stats, Giannis appears to be the best at holding opponents to a low field goal percentage. Yet you don\u2019t bring it to the forefront. This might hurt is chances of being the DPOY as well as MVP. Start adding a little defensive info for Giannis, please. * * * My response: Giannis doesn\u2019t need any help from us, Richard. Trust me. But your points are duly noted and I\u2019ll be sure to spread the words you shared. From: Emmett Dunn Jan. 10, 2020 | 10:36 p.m. I\u2019m going to get straight to it. James Harden needs to be top 2, and there\u2019s an argument for No. 1. We\u2019ve never seen anyone in the modern era of basketball score the ball at the level he does, with the exception of one or two players. Teams have created new defenses just to try and stop him. There is no one more VALUABLE to his team in the league, because for better or worse, the team revolves around him more than any other player in the league. I also have some thoughts on LeBron. He shouldn\u2019t be near the top 3, or above AD, considering AD is the man that the offense runs through. LeBron passes to AD in the clutch, and \u2018Bron has played small in every big this year for them. Also, CP3 needs more love. My ladder as of Jan. 9: 1a. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1b. James Harden 3. Luka Doncic 4. Anthony Davis 5. Nikola Jokic 6. LeBron James 7. Donovan Mitchell 8. Jimmy Butler 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Chris Paul 11. Joel Embiid 12. Kemba Walker 13. Domantas Sabonis 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Rudy Gobert * * * My response: You might be on to something, Emmett. I hadn\u2019t given much thought to a 1a and 1b in terms of ranking the top five. Sure, we\u2019ve seen some ties in the bottom five. But rarely have we seen ties among that top group. You went 15-deep on your list and it looks like the right mix of players to me. Stay tuned for the next Kia Race to the MVP Ladder in a few days. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Can Nets cool off red-hot Jazz? Over the last 12 years, Utah has won 10 or more games in a season two times: in 2008-09 and 2017-18. Tonight, the Jazz try to add to that list as they visit the Nets ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). This one should be intriguing because the Nets are finally healthy and have pretty much everyone (save for Kevin Durant) back in the mix. Additionally, how will Brooklyn try to negate the play of Joe Ingles? He has shot 51% on 3-pointers since joining the starting lineup in early December, while reserve Jordan Clarkson has been a revelation for the Jazz. 2. Another test for Grizzlies There\u2019s no denying Memphis has figured things out of late. Since Christmas, the Grizzlies are 7-2, they lead the NBA in points , assists and field goals made per game and have the third-best offense overall . Memphis has won five in a row and faces the Rockets next ( 8 ET, NBA TV ), who will be without Russell Westbrook (rest) . During that stretch, the Grizzlies have beaten the veteran-led LA Clippers (Jan. 4) and San Antonio Spurs (Jan. 10) as they ready for another veteran squad tonight. Keep an eye on Memphis big man Jonas Valanciunas \u2014 he has 20 double-doubles this season and is fresh off a 30-point, 15-rebound game vs. Golden State. 3. All-Star hopefuls square off in Atlanta There have been all manner of takes of late about Hawks guard Trae Young and whether or not he deserves an All-Star starting spot (which he is currently in line to snag ). He\u2019ll get another chance to showcase his wares as Phoenix visits ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) with its own All-Star hopeful in Devin Booker. The Suns\u2019 guard has shown some clutch ability of late (see the win vs. Orlando last Friday ) and ranks ninth this season in total clutch points scored (Young isn\u2019t far behind at 12th, by the way). This is a great one-on-one matchup that should provide, perhaps, more fuel to the All-Star fire for either player\u2019s case. 4. On this date: Cuban takes control Hard to believe, but it has been 20 years since Mark Cuban purchaes a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks from H. Ross Perot, Jr. In that span, Dallas has gone from one of the worst-run franchises in the NBA to one that has amassed two division titles, two Western Conference titles and an NBA championship in 2011. There are other accolades and players to shine the spotlight on over these 20 years (hello, Dirk Nowitzki!), but for now, let\u2019s take a look back at the 2011 run to the title."},{"id":29409,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-passes-isiah-thomas-career-assists","date":"2020-01-14","title":"LeBron James passes Isiah Thomas for eighth in career assists","content":"Lakers star LeBron James\u2019 inexorable climb up the NBA\u2019s statistical lists continued Monday against Cleveland with his third-quarter dime to Danny Green, pushing him past Pistons legend Isiah Thomas for eighth in career assists .

Interestingly, these two haven\u2019t faced off since last February with James coming out on top when the teams met in Los Angeles. Outside of that, Harden has finished victorious in four of the last five head-to-head matchups. On Saturday, the 30-year-old Harden became the 45th player (and the seventh-youngest) to reach 20,000 career points (20,022) . James accomplished that feat at 28 and is the youngest in NBA history to reach 20,000 career points back in 2013 . Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Oct. 30, 2019  Smart has an eight-inch height disadvantage against Antetokounmpo, but do you think the size mismatch will keep him from trying to throw the shackles on the reigning Kia MVP? San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich phrased it perfectly last week when he called Smart \u201ca tough son of a gun.\u201d One of the league\u2019s elite defenders with plenty of swagger to match, Smart and the Celtics have captured wins in three of their last five outings against Antetokounmpo and the Bucks. The Kings double and triple-teamed Antetokounmpo on Friday to limit him to just 13 points, but you shouldn\u2019t expect similar tactics from the Celtics with a stopper like Smart in the fold. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 14, 2019 Exciting, young All-Star-caliber guards collide here, but both teams\u2019 losing records scuff up some of the shine in this one. Young finished up last week with an off night in a loss to the Wizards as they limited him to 19 points on 7-of-20 shooting. What\u2019s more is Young missed all seven of his 3-point attempts, which tied for the second-most attempts from range without a make in a game for the second-year star. Booker, meanwhile, closed out the week by making a couple of clutch 3-pointers late to lead the Suns past the Magic on Friday. Young won the first two matchups between the phenoms, but Booker, despite committing seven turnovers, dropped 27 points to lead Phoenix to a win when these teams last met in November . Young missed Sunday\u2019s loss to the Nets due to a sore hamstring. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference Last regular season meeting: March 30, 2018 LeBron James\u2019 old sidekick meets up with the new one in Los Angeles. Going back to Dec. 12, 2014, Davis has won three of the last five meetings against Love. But all those outings came during Davis\u2019 time with the New Orleans Pelicans. Davis has missed the Lakers\u2019 last two games with a bruised tailbone, while constant trade speculation continues to swirl around Love, who has shown frustration with Cleveland\u2019s current situation. Love remains a major contributor on the floor, though, and finished up last week with a 15-rebound performance in the Cavaliers\u2019 win over the Denver Nuggets. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Dec. 29, 2019 All-Star floor generals clash in what\u2019s largely been a lopsided affair as Paul is 16-9 in games against Lowry. Paul has come out on top in three of the last five contests against Lowry, but the series is evenly split at 5-5 over the last 10 meetings. Lowry piled up a season-high 15 assists in a loss Sunday to the San Antonio Spurs. Considering the Thunder are 7-13 against teams better than .500, Lowry and the Raptors might have a good shot on the road against Paul, who has torched opponents this season in clutch time .

Can Sixers get fully on track? Just about the time Philadelphia seems to be turning the corner toward Finals-contender status, it falters. Such was the case on Saturday, as it lost 109-91 in Dallas after solid wins against the Thunder and Celtics before that. Things don\u2019t get easier for the Sixers as a visit to Indiana is next ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and they\u2019ll be doing so again without Joel Embiid. Indiana is also struggling as it tries to figure out some lineup permutations . Still, this game may mostly be about the Sixers and whether or not they can show they\u2019re true contenders in the East. 2. Bigs showing out in OKC It\u2019s easy (and not inaccurate) to point to the guard triumvirate of Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder as the reason behind the Thunder being a surprising 22-17. They\u2019ve been clutch when it matters and provided all the scoring a team could want. But as a game with the Wolves nears ( 8 ET, League Pass ), don\u2019t overlook the Thunder\u2019s big men. Nerlens Noel and Steven Adams are excelling as top-of-the-key playmakers, with Adams averaging a career-best 2.7 assists per game this season. Their playmaking has become an underrated aspect to watch in OKC\u2019s surprising rise in 2019-20. 3. Shorthanded Lakers on mend? The Lakers impressed in their last game, dominating the Thunder 125-110 on Saturday despite LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Danny Green all missing the game due to injury. As the Lakers host the Cavs tonight ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ), Green is off the latest injury report while Davis is questionable and James is probable. Davis (tailbone) is not expected to play against Cleveland while James miss the OKC game because of flu-like symptoms. Given the state of both teams, its not unreasonable to expect the Lakers to have the advantage vs. Cleveland \u2014 even if LeBron sits out again. 4. On this date: MJ retires (again) On Jan. 13, 1999, Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan announced his retirement from the NBA for the second time during his 15-year career. He did so with one of the most impressive resumes in league history \u2014 six-time NBA champion, six-time NBA Finals MVP, five-time NBA MVP, 14-time All-Star, 10-time scoring champ and two-time Olympic gold medalist."},{"id":29480,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-return-sunday-against-atlanta-hawks","date":"2020-01-12","title":"Kyrie Irving returns to start for Nets; Trae Young out for Hawks","content":" NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kyrie Irving is back for the Brooklyn Nets.

And on Saturday, he scaled another points-based plateau, becoming the 45th player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points. And yet, the All-NBA guard didn\u2019t have much to say after he surpassed the total in the second quarter of Houston\u2019s blowout win over Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s a great accomplishment obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a bigger picture and bigger goals but it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Teammate and longtime friend Russell Westbrook, who also played in the game when Harden got the first points of his NBA career, was much more effusive in his comments about the milestone. \u201cTo be able to do that on a very, very high level is something we don\u2019t take for granted,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cGrowing up in L.A. and being able to see him progress over the years to me is just a blessing to see as his friend and I\u2019m truly happy for him.\u201d Harden scored 32 points, adding 12 rebounds and eight assists in just three quarters, to help the Rockets roll to the 139-109 victory.

The public address announcer simply said 20,000 after Harden hit the shot, before a video was played during the next timeout to mark the occasion. The video showed him making his first points in the NBA while with the Thunder, then making a free throw that gave him 10,000 points and a replay of the 3 that got him to 20,000. He got the game ball on Saturday and presented it to his mother. \u201c\u2019She has everything,\u201d Harden said. \u201cEvery goal and achievement that I have, she has it.

Keeping composure ranked high on the list.  \u201cBad game, we had a terrible game,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThat was on me for sure. I feel like lately, I don\u2019t know how to play basketball. It wasn\u2019t me and I\u2019ve got to get better \u2014 a lot. [I\u2019m] 20 years old; watch and learn.\u201d What fans inside American Airlines Arena observed was a team that at times let frustration get the best of it as the Lakers, without help from star big man Anthony Davis, rolled to their seventh-consecutive victory to strengthen their grip on the No. 1 spot in the West. Los Angeles lit up the Mavericks for 79 points in the first half alone, with Kyle Kuzma scoring a game-high 21 points through the first two quarters filling in for the injured Davis. Kuzma finished the game with 26 points. Frustration wouldn\u2019t rear its head until 1 minute and 53 seconds before intermission. After Seth Curry hit a technical free throw, Doncic missed two shots from the line. Doncic angrily yanked at the neck of his jersey in response, ripping down the middle, almost to his number.                         Doncic played the end of the half with the torn threads, before emerging in the second half with a new No. 77 jersey. It was this month last year when the second-year pro ripped his jersey in frustration during a 106-98 loss to the LA Clippers as well.                         While Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle pointed to Doncic\u2019s passion to win as the culprit for Friday\u2019s incident, the young guard admitted his own culpability, saying \u201cfrustration\u201d was the reason while pointing out \u201cI\u2019m 20 years old\u201d on multiple occasions. \u201cI know I can get better,\u201d he said. The loss for Dallas marked its fifth in seven games, as Doncic\u2019s star sidekick Kristaps Porzingis, missed his sixth consecutive game due to right knee soreness. LeBron James scored a game-high 35 points and knocked down 14 field goals to move past Michael Jordan for fourth in NBA history in field goals made ( 12,197 ). James also dished seven assists and needs to log just three more to move past Isiah Thomas for eighth place in NBA history. James was asked what advice he\u2019d give Doncic. \u201cIf we sat down and he asked for advice on anything, I can give it to him,\u201d James said. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t think that is for me to ramp off right now in front of you guys. I think he is well beyond his years. He shows that both on the floor and off the floor.\u201d Doncic contributed 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists to go with six turnovers. Still, frustration ate at Doncic from his seat in the corner of the locker room long after the game had come to an end. \u201cHe is a guy that wants to win, and he gets frustrated,\u201d said Carlisle, who was ejected with 9:50 left and the Mavericks trailing 106-86, as Doncic restrained the coach from the referees. \u201cThose are emotions and feelings that are about winning and losing. So, I get it. I get it,\u201d Carlisle added. \u201cHe\u2019s going through a lot this year. He\u2019s going through just a lot of different situations. He\u2019s made some just phenomenal performances, other nights where people have just taken physical liberties on him and beaten the [expletive] out of him. He\u2019s learning how to deal with all that stuff. But it\u2019s not easy\u2026 \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to understand he\u2019s still young. He\u2019s mature beyond his years, in terms of how he sees the game, his skillset, how he can do things out on the floor. But we\u2019re going through a rough stretch right now, and everybody needs to try to keep their emotions in check. This is the whole team. When we do get frustrated, channel that frustration toward the team and each other, keep each other up, keep fighting. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s a murderous stretch right now.\u201d Doncic, Carlisle and the rest of the Mavericks believe the team isn\u2019t receiving proper respect from the officials, with the coach saying that \u201cthere are some things going on out there that are quite frankly shocking, and our guys are going through a rough time because of it.\u201d As the clock struck close to midnight, the last of the weary Mavericks sauntered from the locker room and into the night. On the way out, guard Seth Curry expressed appreciation for the coach standing up for the team and recognizing its frustration. Dallas hosts the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday ( 8:30 ET ) in the second leg of the current back-to-back at home. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be as a coach, and we don\u2019t have the older superstar that can really do that right now, to take a stand against the refs,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t getting a lot of respect out there on the floor as players. Luka taking it to the hole, Delon [Wright] taking it to the rim a lot. I\u2019m getting held a lot off the ball. But we just aren\u2019t getting that respect. So, we have to keep playing through it and playing tough. Hopefully one day it\u2019ll turn around.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Embiid, averaging 23.4 points and 12.3 rebounds in 31 games this season, had surgery on Friday and will be re-evaluated in one to two weeks. He has never played more than 64 games in a season and won\u2019t again this season after he was hurt Monday night in a victory over Oklahoma City . Embiid injured the radial collateral ligament in the ring finger in the first half, a gruesome injury that made teammate Ben Simmons say \u201cI nearly threw up\u201d when he saw the finger. Embiid\u2019s finger overlapped his pinkie to the point that it seemed he had his fingers crossed. He played most of the game with his finger taped and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t go up with two hands.\u201d \u201cThere were a couple of times I could have grabbed with both hands but I just couldn\u2019t. I just kept tapping it,\u201d Embiid said Monday. The Sixers had braced for the worst, though they were certainly used to playing without their 7-foot big man. He was hindered by illness and knee injuries during last season\u2019s playoff run, and the Sixers worked this season to balance his minutes with the proper amount of rest. They usually go as far in the postseason as Embiid can take them \u2014 a small sigh of relief he was hurt before the All-Star break and not headed into the postseason. Mike Scott slid into the starting rotation for Thursday\u2019s game against Boston, along with Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Josh Richardson and Simmons. \u201cAll of a sudden, we\u2019re different,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re just different. I look at this as an opportunity. Nobody\u2019s crying. This is not a \u2018woe is me\u2019 moment, not for me, at all. And not for my players. We\u2019ll take what we have, and what we have, I love.\u201d The 25-year-old Embiid has struggled with injuries ever since he was drafted with the No. 3 pick of the 2014 draft. He missed his first two seasons with foot injuries and hasn\u2019t played more than 64 games in any of the last three. He suffered a broken bone around his left eye and missed games in the 2018 playoffs. The Sixers signed Embiid, a native of Cameroon, to a $148 million, five-year extension that kicked in at the start of the 2018-19 season. He didn\u2019t pick up a basketball until he was a teenager, when a friend informed him that very few 7-footers succeed in soccer. A few months later, Embiid was lured to a basketball camp in the capital of Yaounde run by NBA veteran Luc Mbah a Moute, one of just two players from Cameroon to have played in the NBA. Mbah a Moute persuaded Embiid\u2019s parents to let him move 6,000 miles to Florida, and helped enroll him at Montverde Academy, one of the best high school programs in the country. He played just 28 games in his lone season at Kansas before he left for the NBA. \u201cHow does he get his health where he\u2019s back and feeling cocky and comfortable and ready to go where he\u2019s healthy, not just for this playoffs but for many playoffs,\u201d Brown asked. \u201cI care for Joel and his future.

An MRI exam performed on Davis showed no major concerns, and X-rays were negative. He was extremely sore, but his injuries appear to be only bruises. Davis was hurt when he fell hard on his back and tailbone after trying to block the shot of New York\u2019s Julius Randle in the third quarter of the Lakers\u2019 sixth straight win, 117-87 over the Knicks on Tuesday night. Davis pounded the court in pain and stayed down for about two minutes while his teammates gathered around him. He eventually rose with help and walked off the court slowly, but under his own power. After the game, the Lakers\u2019 Danny Green called it an \u201cugly fall, man. It\u2019s probably going to take some time, seeing how long it took for him to get up and walk out of here, the way he\u2019s walking out of here.\u201d The news might not be as bad as the Lakers feared, however. The team initially diagnosed the injury as a bruised sacrum \u2014 the lower part of the spine. But the Lakers altered their diagnosis to a soft-tissue bruise after the MRI, which likely means the injury is less serious. The Lakers play Oklahoma City on Saturday ( 8 ET, League Pass ) before returning to Los Angeles. Davis will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, but he is widely expected to re-sign with the Lakers. He is averaging 27.7 points and 9.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles after the team traded most of its young core to New Orleans for him. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our pillars,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cHe\u2019s our present. He\u2019s our future. He\u2019s one of the best players in the world, so obviously he means a lot.\u201d Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":29505,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-stars-return-past-cities","date":"2020-01-10","title":"Welcome back: How NBA standouts were received in their returns","content":"Take a look back at some notable, recent player returns in the NBA. * * * What Happened: For 11 seasons, Russell Westbrook gave Oklahoma City his all. He became an eight-time All-Star and 2017 Kia MVP with the franchise. So, it was no surprise when the organization executed his return game to perfection on Jan. 9, 2020 . When announcing the starting lineup, a remarkable tribute video played on the jumbotron before Westbrook\u2019s name was called and fans gave the city icon one of the most rousing ovations this season. Westbrook said he felt like home afterwards. What happened: George\u2019s \u201cera\u201d in Oklahoma City wasn\u2019t exactly marked by much playoff success (three total playoff wins in two first-round series). But George was a beloved player in his time with the Thunder and fans made sure he knew that on Dec. 22, 2019 when he came back to town. George received loud cheers when he was introduced pregame and OKC had additional reason to cheer at the evening\u2019s end as the Thunder upset the visiting LA Clippers. What happened: It was hard to imagine anything but an outpouring of love for Leonard in his Toronto return \u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what he got. The man who led the Raptors to the 2019 NBA title (and joined elite company in being named Finals MVP) was adored by the Toronto crowd on Dec. 11, 2019 . Leonard got a touching pregame tribute, received his 2019 championship ring and then led his LA Clippers with 24 points in a romp of a road win. What happened: Pelicans fans had plenty of pent-up frustration with Davis they wanted to get out as he made his trip back to New Orleans on Nov. 27, 2019 . Davis, however, wasn\u2019t bothered in the least by their boos as he burned his former team for 41 points, had a critical steal and a pair of game-sealing free throws in a 114-110 victory. What happened: Good feelings flowed as Mike Conley, who spent his first 12 seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies, made his trip back to Tennessee on Nov. 15, 2019 . He said after the game the emotion of the moment caught him off guard and somewhat affected his play. That much seemed to be true based on the box score: the usually efficient Conley had 15 points (on 5-for-19 shooting), four rebounds and three assists in a loss. What happened: There was no love lost between Knicks fans and Porzingis, who asked for and received a trade to Dallas last January. New York fans got a measure of revenge, though, as the Knicks won this game ( on Nov. 14, 2019 ) and the Nov. 8 matchup in Dallas to sweep the season series. As for Porzingis, he finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in the defeat. What happened: Rose had made previous return trips to Chicago in 2016 (with the Knicks) and 2017 and \u201918 (with the Timberwolves). This one, however, felt different as he was playing for a division-rival team (the Pistons) and was doing so early in the season ( Nov. 1, 2019 ). The former Kia MVP winner finished with 23 points and seven assists, but the Pistons ended up losing the game. What happened: Minnesota nice was not in effect when Butler returned to take on the Wolves on March 30, 2019 . Minnesota\u2019s fans were still smarting from the way Butler forced his way out of town early in 2018-19 and booed him all game long. It was all for naught, though, as the Sixers won and Butler had a solid overall game (12 points, 13 rebounds, five assists). What happened: Few players in recent Celtics lore are as beloved as Thomas was during his stint there. He never played against Boston as a member of the Cavs or Lakers and had to wait until March 18, 2019 to get his return game in Massachusetts with Denver. He had a quiet night (zero points, two assists) on the court performance-wise, but basked in a tremendous amount of love from Boston fans no matter what. What happened: After nine seasons in Toronto, DeRozan had become the team\u2019s all-time leading scorer and among its best-ever in several other categories. In the summer of 2018, the Raptors sent him to the Spurs for Kawhi Leonard. DeRozan\u2019s return to Toronto on Feb. 22, 2019 was one of the season\u2019s most anticipated dates. Although his squad lost, DeRozan was adored by the crowd as he finished with 23 points, four rebounds and eight assists. What happened: From the Slam Dunk Contest victory to All-Star appearances to playoff runs, Blake Griffin was at the forefront of the Clippers\u2019 success during their \u201cLob City\u201d era. The Clippers stunned Griffin in trading him to the Pistons midway through the 2017-18 season and this marked his first game against the Clippers in L.A. He was no doubt up for the game on Jan. 12, 2019 , finishing with 44 points and eight rebounds in Detroit\u2019s 109-104 victory. What happened: Spurs fans are a loyal bunch, but if you do them wrong, their quickly affection goes by the wayside. Leonard got a first-hand look at that when his Raptors came to San Antonio on Jan. 3, 2019 . He was booed early and often that game as the Spurs were fueled by the crowd\u2019s emotion and prevailed 125-107. Leonard finished with 21 points and five assists while DeMar DeRozan \u2014 whom the Spurs traded Leonard for \u2014 logged his first career triple-double (21 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists). What happened: What a difference a championship can make when it comes to a return game. James first returned to Cleveland in 2010 (with Miami) and was treated like public enemy No. 1 that game. His return on Nov. 21, 2019 was much more pleasant as he was cheered longingly and the team showed a video tribute to his career (which included the Cavs\u2019 run to the 2016 title). As for this game, James finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists as the Lakers won 109-105. What happened: From 2009-17, the Jazz watched as Hayward grew from Draft pick to an NBA All-Star (in 2016-17). He jilted the Jazz in the 2017 free-agent summer for the Celtics and Utah fans were itching to let Hayward know what they felt about that. After a gruesome leg injury halted Hayward\u2019s 2017-18 campaign after one game, he finally returned to Salt Lake City on Nov. 9, 2018 . Utah fans booed him all game as he fared decently (13 points, seven assists) and the Jazz won the game. What happened: The short list of most beloved players in Grizzlies franchise history undoubtedly has Randolph\u2019s name on it. Perhaps no player better personified the \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d-era and his departure via free agency in 2017 for Sacramento was a sad one in Memphis. But, there was nothing but love for Randolph on Jan. 19, 2018 : he got a video tribute and a pregame standing ovation, finishing with four points and six rebounds in a 106-88 Grizzlies win. What happened: Anthony embodied an era for the Knicks in the early 2010s and his return to Madison Square Garden on Dec. 16, 2017 was one of the most anticipated games that season. A video tribute to his career and a huge ovation from the crowd followed, but the night was forgettable for he and his Thunder teammates. Anthony scored 12 points and was shut out in the second half as New York romped past Oklahoma City, 111-96. What happened: George made it known in the summer of 2017 he was not long for Indiana, so the team obliged and dealt him to Oklahoma City. That exit didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t hurt feelings on the Pacers\u2019 side, though. George rose to stardom with Indiana and his return on Dec. 13, 2017 was an emotionally-charged one at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. While he struggled stats-wise that game \u2014 12 points on 3-for-14 shooting \u2014 Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams overpowered Indiana in the Thunder\u2019s win. What happened: Through  all the ups and downs together, Kings fans and Cousins forged a strong bond in their 6 1\/2 seasons together. His return game on Oct. 26, 2017 was filled with overwhelming support and love with a standing ovation during pregame introductions. While there was a smattering of boos, too, they were hard to hear after Cousins scored after winning. Overall, he dominated his old team (41 points and 23 rebounds) to power a 114-106 comeback win. What happened: Known as \u2018The Grindfather\u2019 during his time with the Grizzlies, Allen was the driving force behind the defense-first mentality Memphis embraced in its \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d heyday. Allen spent seven seasons (2010-17) with the Grizzlies, amassing All-Defensive Team honors in six of those seasons. His return game on Oct. 18, 2017 featured a video tribute and a lengthy standing ovation. He didn\u2019t score in the game, but had two rebounds and two blocks in the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 103-91 loss."},{"id":29481,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tj-warren-jimmy-butler","date":"2020-01-10","title":"NBA fines T.J.

Through Thursday, 566 (46%) of the season\u2019s 1,230 games have been played. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 13 weekend\u2026 When the Miami Heat won in Indiana on Wednesday, the quality of the win was a little bit lost in the Jimmy Butler-T.J. Warren back-and-forth. But the victory improved the Heat to 10-6 in games between the 13 teams that currently have winning records . After losing six of their first nine games against that group, the Heat have won seven straight, with two wins against the Sixers and two against the Pacers in that stretch. Only the Bucks have a better winning percentage in games between the 13 good teams\u2026 But 10 teams have been better statistically in games within the group of 13. The Heat\u2019s 10 wins have come by a total of 80 points (six of the 10 have been by five points or fewer), while their six losses have come by a total of 93 points (four of the six have been by 15 points or more). The Heat have the league\u2019s second best record \u2014 11-3, behind only the Bucks, again \u2014 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes . That includes a 7-1 mark in games that were within five in the last five against the other 12 teams over .500. The Heat have been better defensively than offensively in their 16 games within the group, but the bigger difference between their 3-6 start and their seven-game winning streak in those games has been on offense (102.3 vs. 110.4 points scored per 100 possessions). They\u2019ve shot better from 3-point range (Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson are a combined 44-for-92 from beyond the arc over the last seven) and done a much better job of taking care of the ball (15.3 vs. 12.6 turnovers per 100 possessions). The Heat don\u2019t play another game against a team currently over .500 until next Friday, when they visit Oklahoma City. They\u2019ll spend this weekend in New York, visiting the Nets on Friday and the Knicks on Sunday. The Nets are 4-11 against teams currently over .500 (and enter the weekend with a seven-game losing streak), while the Knicks are 2-15 (with both wins having come against Dallas). When the Heat beat the Raptors last week, holding the champs to just five points (on 2-for-16 shooting) over a nine-minute stretch in the fourth quarter, they did so with a zone defense. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Heat played zone for 63 defensive plays last Thursday.  That\u2019s a lot. But seeing a team play zone for most of the final three quarters of a game isn\u2019t as surprising as it would have been last season or the season prior. In 2017-18, only two teams \u2014 the Atlanta Hawks and Dallas Mavericks \u2014 played at least 100 possessions of zone over the full season, according to Synergy. This season, 10 teams have already played at least 100 possessions of zone, and four more are on pace to do so by the end of the season. Often, a zone is employed out of a timeout, to keep the opponent from being able to run the play it designed in the huddle. But more and more, we\u2019re seeing it for more than one or two possessions at a time. Overall, zone hasn\u2019t been more effective than man-to-man this season (even if you remove the Wizards\u2019 30th-ranked defense from consideration). According to Synergy, offenses have scored 0.95 points per play against zone and 0.96 points per play against man in half-court situations. But among the 10 teams that have used it for at least 100 possessions, the Heat (0.85 points allowed per play), Dallas Mavericks (0.84) and LA Clippers (0.85) have found some success with the zone. According to Synergy, three teams \u2013 the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Oklahoma City Thunder \u2013 have yet to play any zone. And really, zone defense still isn\u2019t all that common. The league-leading Wizards have used it on less than 11% of their defensive possessions, according to Synergy. But it\u2019s certainly being used a lot more than just a couple of seasons ago, and we should no longer be surprised when we see it, even in a big game between two good teams. Is it Al Horford time in Philly?   The team that has had the most zone played against them (267 possessions) is the Philadelphia 76ers, who rank 25th in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (34%), with just two players \u2013 Furkan Korkmaz (38.4%) and Tobias Harris (35.6%) \u2013 who have shot better than the league average (35.4%) on at least 100 3-point attempts . The Sixers have lost Joel Embiid to a left hand injury , suffered early in the team\u2019s win over the Thunder on Monday. Embiid returned to that game, but is set to have surgery on Friday and could miss an extended period of time. Without their All-NBA center, the Sixers did get a good win on Thursday, improving to 3-0 against the Boston Celtics and 4-4 without Embiid. On points in the paint or from free throws, the Sixers outscored the Celtics, 62-46. The Sixers\u2019 issues are sometimes boiled down to the idea that their two stars \u2014 Embiid and Ben Simmons \u2014 don\u2019t complement each other. But it\u2019s interesting that Simmons\u2019 *usage rate has been a little bit lower (19.3%) and he has shot worse (effective field goal percentage of 53.1%) with Embiid off the floor than with Embiid on the floor (19.5%, 60.7%). * Usage rate = The percentage of a team\u2019s possessions a player completes (via field goal attempt, trip to the line or turnover) while he\u2019s on the floor. Josh Richardson, the teammate that has played the most minutes alongside Embiid , has shot much better with Embiid on the floor , though he did lead the team with 29 points and seven assists on Thursday. The same can\u2019t be said for the Sixers\u2019 forwards. Tobias Harris, Al Horford and Mike Scott have all shot much better with Embiid off the floor than they have with him on the floor. While Harris and Scott have seen relatively small jumps in usage rate with Embiid off the floor, Horford\u2019s usage has been more than double with Embiid off the floor (21.6%) than it\u2019s been with him on the floor (10.4%) . Horford\u2019s three highest-scoring games (32, 25 and 23 points) have all come in games Embiid has missed and against Boston on Thursday, Horford registered 17 points (on 7-for-11 shooting), eight rebounds, six assists and two blocks. An extended absence for Embiid might help Horford find his mojo. Given how awful the Sixers were in the minutes Embiid was off the floor in the conference semifinals last year ( minus-109 in 99 minutes remains mind-boggling), Horford\u2019s primary task is keeping the team afloat in those minutes this year. And in that regard, so far, so good. The Sixers have outscored their opponents by 6.8 points per 100 possessions (with strong offensive numbers) in the minutes that Horford has been on the floor without Embiid. Does the size of his contract ($69 million guaranteed beyond this season) require that Horford be better with Embiid on the floor? Perhaps. We\u2019ll have to wait a bit before seeing if Horford can turn his season around in that regard. An abundance of shooters in Utah   There are 93 players who have shot better than the league average (35.4%) on at least 100 3-point attempts. Twenty-five of the league\u2019s 30 teams have two, three or four of those 93 players. The team with the fewest ( one ) is the Minnesota Timberwolves, and they\u2019ve been without him (Karl-Anthony Towns) for the last 12 games. The team with the most ( six ) is the Utah Jazz. One of those six (Mike Conley) has been out for 15 of the last 16 games. But they added the sixth when they traded for Jordan Clarkson on Christmas Eve. Three teams \u2014 the Pistons , Clippers and Raptors \u2014 have five guys who have shot better than the league average on at least 100 3-point attempts. Moreyball McLemore  Ben McLemore is new to the Houston Rockets this season. But the seventh-year guard has taken to Moreyball like a fish to water. Through 37 games with his new team, McLemore has yet to attempt a single shot from between the paint and the 3-point line . He\u2019s the only player in the league who has taken more than 15 shots from outside the paint without a single one of those shots having come inside the arc. McLemore has taken 252 shots from outside the paint and all of them have been 3-point attempts. Through his first six seasons in the league, McLemore\u2019s ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts was 2.5. This season, it\u2019s infinity. The next highest ratios of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts among the 206 players who have taken at least 100 shots from outside the paint belong to\u2026 More Rockets \u2013 Austin Rivers, Danuel House and P.J. Tucker \u2013 aren\u2019t much further down the list. Russell Westbrook has taken 169 (75%) of the team\u2019s 225 mid-range shots .

On the surface, then, it appears Jerry West has little in common with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George other than a job working for the Clippers. Yet their shared basketball lineage is clear. In the 1960s and 70s , West would drop 30 points on any given night and then silence the man he was guarding on other nights \u2014 or the same one, if needed. The Godfather of the two-way player, those rarest of NBA talents, West set the Hall of Fame example Leonard and George have been following since. The Clippers\u2019 wing duo similarly torture opponents on both ends, swiping passes on defense and hitting shots from all over on offense. West was the flag-bearer for baseline-to-baseline excellence during his NBA career, all spent with the Lakers, and now as a consultant to the Clippers has one of the best seats in the house \u2014 front row, directly behind the basket near the home bench \u2014 to study two teammates who hope to do a respectable imitation of him. It\u2019s a high bar to clear. \u201cThe Logo\u201d was unrivaled for his broad two-way skills (although Oscar Robertson worshippers might object). Still, if the Clippers manage to sip champagne in June and stage the most unlikely championship parade in L.A. history, it\u2019ll be because Kawhi and George took matters into their own hands by leaving 94 feet worth of fingerprints. \u201cThey\u2019re fun to watch,\u201d West said. And you know why he feels that way. In the decade that just finished, only seven players averaged at least 25 points per game in a season and also made All-Defensive first team in that same season or another: Leonard, George, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett. If you include all of the 2000s, then add Tim Duncan and Gary Payton to that list. That\u2019s it. Yes, there were others who, on merits, could put up a case for being in such company. Chris Paul, for example, had the defensive honors without the scoring average. In any event, the elite two-way NBA player is the closest thing to a five-tool baseball player , both celebrated not only for their talent, but also for their scarcity. When Kawhi weighed factors in free agency last summer, he wanted the Clippers to find someone like him \u2014 someone who could be a tag-team partner in front of both baskets. The Lakers already had such a combination across town in Davis and LeBron, although Father Time, as he usually does, was beginning to steal LeBron\u2019s defensive desire. There was only one candidate, then, who reflected Kawhi\u2019s skills. Once the trade with Oklahoma City was finalized and George was in the fold, the Clippers, with two members of the two-way club, saw their championship hopes soar. \u201cWe\u2019re in sync in a lot of ways,\u201d George said of Leonard. \u201cJust in how we see things on the floor and how the game should be played.\u201d In conversations with NBA talent evaluators, elite two-way players are hard to find because of the athletic ability and knack for scoring that\u2019s required. Many offensive or defensive specialists are made to feel comfortable in their own skin, often being rewarded handsomely for being one-dimensional. It takes a determined player to check both boxes. If most two-way players are made instead of born, the question becomes: Is it harder to turn a shutdown defender into a big scorer, or vice versa? \u201cMan,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, \u201cthat\u2019s a tough one to answer.\u201d Leonard and George are self-made scorers who never lost their DNA for defense. Leonard averaged 7.9 points per game as a rookie and had future Hall of Famers ahead of him in the playbook on the Spurs. His jumper was flat and he rarely looked to shoot 3-pointers. Meanwhile in Indiana, George averaged 7.8 ppg and yielded to Danny Granger, Mike Dunleavy, Darren Collison and \u2026 Tyler Hansbrough. West was much the same, excelling on defense initially, although he quickly developed shooting instincts and came into the NBA as a complete player. \u201cDefense was the strongest part of my game when I first started,\u201d West said. \u201cYou can score points, but I always felt it was about defense first. I didn\u2019t have a choice, really. When I was in college, I always had to guard the best person, regardless what size they were. \u201cI was 6-4 and blessed with long arms. And I had a gift to know angles and learn the art of anticipation. It was something that was developed in college because we pressed and trapped. We did all the things so important for being a defender. I began thinking a play ahead. Thinking who you\u2019re guarding.\u201d So why did West make the NBA All-Defensive team only five times? Because the league didn\u2019t create the award until the 1969-70 season, his 10th. After that, and well into his twilight, he made it every year (four first teams, one second team) until his final season \u2026 when he played only 31 games because of knee troubles and a strained groin. Remember, too, that the NBA didn\u2019t track steals until 1973-74 , West\u2019s last season. Yet West, then 36, averaged 2.6 steals that season despite playing hurt. Fast-forward to the present day, and that average hasn\u2019t been touched in 10 NBA seasons.  Back then, the NBA also had fewer teams , which caused a greater concentration of top players, which meant West didn\u2019t get many breathers in terms of nightly defensive assignments. He constantly saw John Havlicek, Hal Greer, Dave Bing, Lenny Wilkens, Walt Frazier, Rick Barry, Earl Monroe \u2014 all the sharpshooters and quick-movers of that day. Unless that player was a center or power forward, chances are good that West would be assigned to him. \u201cJerry was tenacious,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cYou knew you were in for a tough night when you played the Lakers.\u201d What\u2019s astonishing is how West had the juice for defense while burning so many calories on offense. Understand that for a stretch of 11 seasons, West averaged at least 25.9 ppg. Mid-career, he added point guard responsibilities and overall, he averaged 39.2 mpg \u2014 more than what many of today\u2019s players muster in a season. Not to mention that West, and other players of that era, lacked all the modern conveniences (private jets, advanced physical therapy, reduced back-to-back games, load management, etc., etc.) enjoyed today. \u201cI was very fortunate,\u201d West said. \u201cI had a lot of energy. I didn\u2019t get tired. The competitive part of you, you\u2019re either born with it or learn it. Also you have to really hate to lose. I think sometimes if you can make a difference in a game with a defensive play, a steal here and there, it\u2019s just crucial, so you do it and don\u2019t worry about offense until you needed to.\u201d In the 1965 playoff series against the Baltimore Bullets, Elgin Baylor suffered a knee injury in Game 1 and was done. West responded by scoring 49 points in the Lakers\u2019 win. In Game 2, he went for 52. In the next two games, both losses, he had 44 and 48. Game 5 produced 43 in a win, and in the closeout game he had 42. His 46.3 points is still the highest for any playoff series. And of course, he remains the only Finals MVP winner who didn\u2019t win the championship. That was made possible in the 1969 series when Celtics player-coach Bill Russell disrespectfully refused to double-team West in the first two games. He dropped 53 and then 41 points on Sam Jones as the Lakers went up 2-0 before losing in seven. These scenes are foreign to Leonard and George, born decades after the fact. To them, West won championships with the Lakers \u2026 as the team architect. Today, he\u2019s a valued member of the Clippers\u2019 front office. Yet, there\u2019s respect: When Kawhi and his uncle, Dennis Robertson, held a final meeting at Rivers\u2019 home before signing, the only other person in the room was West.  When Leonard arrived in San Antonio in 2011, his rebounding appetite was apparent. (As you know, board man gets paid and all that.) His defense quickly rose to NBA level, which allowed him to carve a role in the rotation of a championship-caliber team. Offensively, though, Kawhi needed polish. He shot just 25% on 3-pointers at San Diego State. He had little confidence in his range and zero experience in clutch situations because the Spurs had Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili for that. \u201cBut Kawhi just worked at it,\u201d said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. \u201cHe wanted to be a complete player so he wasn\u2019t satisfied. He put in the time on his shot and kept improving, and as we evolved as a team, he found himself with the ball.\u201d Leonard\u2019s rep as an elite defender soared in the 2014 Finals when his claws on LeBron proved pivotal; in Game 3 for example, Kawhi outscored LeBron 29-22. But as Kawhi won back-to-back Kia Defensive Player of the Year awards in 2015-16 , his scoring improved enough to make him the featured option on the Spurs. He went from 7.9 ppg as a rookie to 25.5 ppg by his fifth season. After mastering the mid-range and post-up, Kawhi stretched his range to where he became comfortable from deep. In his playoff career, he\u2019s 41.1% on 3-pointers . \u201cIt\u2019s all about working hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI always want to be the best player I can be.\u201d George\u2019s offense developed in a similarly gradual fashion. He shot 29% from deep as a rookie. As he sharpened his shooting skills, the Pacers improved as a team, making return trips to the playoffs and briefly putting a chill into LeBron and the Heat. George\u2019s scoring average improved six straight years (discounting his injury-interrupted 2014-15 season), and last season in Oklahoma City his 28-point average finished runner-up to James Harden for the scoring lead. Oh, and he made first team All-Defense by leading the league in steals. \u201cOffensively he had a long way to go as a rookie,\u201d said Frank Vogel, George\u2019s coach in Indiana at the time. \u201cThe shooting, the passing, the court awareness, he had a long way to grow. You can\u2019t grow when you\u2019re not playing. He had the ability to stay on the court defensively, and that\u2019s what gave me the confidence to throw him out there and learn offensively.\u201d George and Kawhi are aligned defensively. They anticipate steals, provide help, cover in the open floor and play tight on the perimeter without fear of being beaten off the dribble because of their quick ability to recover. There\u2019s always an interested spectator seated behind the home basket at Staples Center who studies them. \u201cThey have magnificent intuition, great hands, anticipation and strength,\u201d West said. \u201cThey have all the things that are necessary to succeed. \u201cLook at Kawhi: Playing down in San Antonio was a good learning experience and he built on that. He had the instincts to do it right away. You watch him and Paul out there and you say, \u2018Oh my God, how are you gonna get around these guys with the length they have?\u2019 They cut the angles on passing. Watching those guys play the angles is something else.\u201d George said he\u2019s all ears whenever West offers advice, because game recognizes game. \u201cHe showed me something I hadn\u2019t thought about, how I go about attacking,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was with my lead foot. I\u2019m accustomed to having my feet a certain way. He says to angle it towards the basket so I\u2019m always leaning toward the basket. Just some small detail stuff that he\u2019s able to see because of who he is and what he did. If there\u2019s small things he thinks I can work on, believe me, I\u2019m working on it the next day.\u201d As the Clippers navigate this ambitious season, they\u2019ll need everything on both ends from their pair of elite two-ways. Well, check that. \u201cI\u2019m glad we got all three,\u201d Rivers said. * * * Shaun Powell  has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He\u2019s been at this long enough to know there\u2019s no sense in making the game any more difficult than it already is. When asked what changes for his team when one of his superstars (James Harden) is available and the other (Russell Westbrook) is not, his lighting-quick response shouldn\u2019t be misconstrued. \u201cNothing,\u201d D\u2019Antoni shot back Wednesday night in a hallway at State Farm Arena before Harden roasted the Atlanta Hawks for a 40-point triple-double . \u201cIt\u2019s just more James \u2026 for better or worse.\u201d Things tend to work out for the better where Harden is concerned. The league\u2019s leading scorer has only grown more and more unstoppable as he dives deeper into D\u2019Antoni\u2019s offensive system that caters perfectly to his skill set. Harden has proven to be equally effective no matter who is playing alongside him, be it Westbrook, Chris Paul or anyone else. At the end of day, the Harden Show must go on. That\u2019s been obvious this season, as Harden continues his assault on the NBA record books. He trails only Oscar Robertson (22) when it comes to 40-point triple-doubles (15). He\u2019s chasing 40 points per game (37.9) while Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant start 2020 in street clothes, proving he has no active peer who can score like he can. Even as he and Hawks guard Trae Young made triple-double history on Wednesday, the sight of Harden toying with defenders was a stark reminder of just how next level his abilities have become. \u201cThe craziest part about what he does is that he\u2019s rarely if ever the biggest, fastest or most athletic player on the court and yet the entire game revolves around him because of the way he can manipulate things with his dribble and shot,\u201d said an anonymous scout at Hawks-Rockets. \u201cHe\u2019s a physical specimen: 6-5, 230 and in great shape. You don\u2019t play the minutes he has any other way. But whenever we talk about him, we talk about his shot creation and how he can get shots basically any which way he wants. \u201cWe\u2019re always talking about guys being \u2018unicorns\u2019 and just how unique the superstar players in our game have always been, James is his own category \u2026 I couldn\u2019t give you a player comparison that would make any sense. He\u2019s just different, perfectly suited for the time he\u2019s playing in and an absolutely transcendent shot-maker at the same time.\u201d Paul, now in Oklahoma City, has seen it from both sides. He competes against Harden now (as he did for years), but spent two seasons alongside him (2017-19) as Houston challenged the Golden State Warriors for Western Conference supremacy. \u201c James, I said it before last year, he might be the best offensive player to ever play,\u201d Paul said Thursday night after the Thunder held Harden to a season-low 17 points in a 113-92 OKC win . \u201c He \u2019 s tough with the step back and getting to the free throw line.\u201d But for as many admirers as Harden\u2019s game has, there are critics aplenty, too. His shot selection, manipulation of the game to draw fouls and his will-he-or-won\u2019t-he attitude on defense continues to frustrate some purists. Harden, however, will not stray. He\u2019s staying true to what transformed him from a Kia Sixth Man Award winner to a Kia MVP and one of the best players of his generation \u2026 and one of the greatest scorers the game has ever seen. * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 30.3 points, 12.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.1 blocks Giannis just keeps cranking out the monster performances for the league-leading Bucks, regardless of the quality of the opposition, hence his latest Eastern Conference Player of the Week honor. He worked the Warriors for 30 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and a steal in a hard-fought win Wednesday night. He\u2019s listed as probable with back soreness for Friday\u2019s game against Sacramento ( 10 ET, League Pass ). Last week: No. 5 Season stats: 25.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, 10.8 assists, 1.3 steals The Western Conference Player of the Week , LeBron will get another shot at matching up with Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks on Friday ( 9:45 ET, ESPN ). This time he\u2019ll likely do it without Anthony Davis (muscle bruise), which means we should see plenty of LeBron vs. Luka in this one. LeBron\u2019s had two triple-doubles in his past five games and might need another one to escape Dallas with a win. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 29.6 points, 9.7 rebounds, 9.0 assists, 1.2 steals Talk about a young player living in the moment, Doncic has been at his competitive best in three games against the Lakers this season. He\u2019s averaging 25.7 points, 10.7 assists and 8.7 rebounds against LeBron James and Co . Doncic hasn\u2019t shied away from the challenge of matching up against his idol, which should make for an entertaining show Friday at American Airlines Center. Adding to the storylines, LeBron just passed Doncic in the latest All-Star returns released Thursday. Last week: No. 4 Season stats: 37.9 points, 6.0 rebounds, 7.5 assists, 1.8 steals Harden\u2019s uncharacteristic shooting night on Thursday \u2014 his 17 points was his lowest total since he scored 19 in a loss to Milwaukee in the season opener \u2014 was just one of the Rockets\u2019 problems in Russell Westbrook\u2019s celebrated return to Oklahoma City . Harden and Westbrook were both upstaged by Paul, who was Harden\u2019s former running mate and the man who took Westbrook\u2019s place in the Thunder lineup and locker room. Last week: No. 6 Season stats: 20.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 6.6 assists, 2.0 steals Butler\u2019s choice words for Indiana\u2019s T.J. Warren will overshadow anything else he has done this season until he gets back on the floor Friday vs. the Brooklyn Nets ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). The dust-up with Warren is overshadowing the fact that Butler\u2019s fire and drive have fueled the Heat\u2019s stunning start to this season.

Irving has been out of the lineup for nearly two months because of a right shoulder injury. However, he told reporters Thursday he expects to be re-evaluated next week. Just being cleared to play is a big step to Irving. \u201cWe just see where we end up in the next few days,\u201d Irving said . \u201cRealistically, we will re-evaluate tomorrow. See how I feel tomorrow. Then go Saturday \u2014 probably another practice.\u201d There is no exact date for his return, but Irving said Thursday he\u2019s assigned himself a deadline of one week. \u201cHopefully I get some game reps in addition to practice probably in the next week or so, it could be less than that but I\u2019ll give myself a week.\u201d Irving was able to fully participate in practices for the first time on Thursday, which included him going through some 5-on-5 contact drills, ESPN\u2019s Malika Andrews reports . He said that a week and a half ago, he began to do 2-on-2 work with coaches as he slowly began ramping up his workload. When asked if there are any limitations about what he\u2019s able to do, he said he has none \u201cother than just keeping my shoulder maintenance program going before I get on the floor.\u201d Aside from Irving being on the court, the Nets got more good news in seeing Kevin Durant do some individual drill work at practice. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said he has discussed how to run the offense with Irving and Durant and how it might look in two months. In late October, Durant ruled out any hopes of a return this season. When Atkinson was asked Thursday about that possibility, he said the team is still operating under the notion he is out for the season. Atkinson also declined to say what kind of workouts Durant is having, but did say \u201che\u2019s progressing fantastically.\u201d Durant is recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon. He was injured while playing for the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, then left the Warriors to sign with the Nets in July. Irving has played in just 11 games this season, averaging 28.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.2 assists. In the latest NBA All-Star Voting returns , Irving ranks second in the Eastern Conference among guards with 1,351,997 votes. He saw nothing wrong with him being so high in the voting tallies despite playing in so few games. \u201cI put a lot of work in this league to be up there whether I\u2019m playing or not,\u201d Irving said. \u201cIf it\u2019s an All-Star Game, then I would vote for myself as well.\u201d Overall, this was a marked change in Irving\u2019s demeanor and the overall team vibe when it came to him playing again this season. Just five days ago , Irving said there was a possibility he could need surgery on the shoulder. Irving\u2019s shoulder problem began with overuse near the end of training camp and got worse early in the regular season. He finally stopped playing after a Nov. 14 game in Denver and the Nets have said his injury is an impingement. Irving said he also had bursitis in the shoulder. After signing with Brooklyn last July, Irving was hurt even before training camp when he was hit in the face while scrimmaging with teammates. He was hit again when he returned for an exhibition game in China, forcing him back to the sidelines. Irving said that he had a cortisone shot in his shoulder on Dec. 24. He hoped then that the medication would stave off the need for surgery but was unsure of the cortisone\u2019s effect.

ESPN.com, citing unidentified sources, reported that Beilein suggested during a Wednesday film session that his players were no longer playing like a bunch of thugs. Beilein told ESPN he had meant to say slugs in reference to the team\u2019s effort level. Beilein repeated that explanation Thursday after his team\u2019s shootaround in Detroit, where the Cavaliers face the Pistons on Thursday night. \u201cI was saying: \u2018Were making a lot of mistakes mentally, and we deserve better because we\u2019re really playing hard right now. We\u2019re not playing like slugs. We\u2019re playing hard,'\u201d Beilein said. \u201cAnd somehow that word came out.\u201d Beilein said he called the players afterward to explain the situation, and he said he apologized. \u201cThere was really positive reinforcement from the guys this morning and last night. Very understanding, but it\u2019s something that certainly they understand that it was serious,\u201d Beilein said. \u201cSomething that shouldnt have happened.\u201d It\u2019s been a rocky start for Beilein, a wildly successful college coach who left his job at Michigan to take over the Cavaliers before this season. Cleveland is 10-27 entering Thursday\u2019s game, and there have been hints of dysfunction along the way. About a month ago, a report in The Athletic cited unidentified players saying that Beilein was being tuned out. More recently, star forward Kevin Love had a verbal exchange with general manager Koby Altman. Love also threw up his arms in disgust several times while on the floor.

But this time, coach Billy Donovan\u2019s response hit differently. Explaining how the Thunder have successfully navigated losing a pair of NBA All-Stars over the summer in Paul George and Russell Westbrook \u2014 who returns to Chesapeake Energy Arena tonight for the first since being traded to the Houston Rockets \u2014 Donovan incisively invoked the \u201cL\u201d word. That\u2019s right. \u201cLegacy.\u201d \u201cI say this, and I really believe this: I think that you always remember who you play with,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWhether there\u2019s rumors out there or [questions of whether] guys are gonna be going here or there, it doesn\u2019t make a difference. Any time you\u2019re spending time with somebody for a significant time, those relationships to me are really where your legacy comes from.\u201d So far, the Thunder have performed that task masterfully to remain in playoff contention in the Western Conference, despite gaping holes left by the departures of George and Westbrook. The Thunder ran off an 11-4 record in December , earning Donovan NBA Western Conference Coach of the Month , and have won 10 of their last 12 games. Oklahoma City\u2019s current run seemed improbable over the summer when it traded George , a six-time All-Star to the LA Clippers in exchange for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari and the Clippers\u2019 first-round picks in 2022, 2024, and 2026, along with two first-round selections via Miami (2021 and 2023), in addition to the right to swap first-round picks in 2023 and 2025. The waters sloshed into murkier territory less than a week after the George trade became official, when reports surfaced about the Thunder moving the face of the franchise in Westbrook, an eight-time All-Star and 2016-17 Kia NBA Most Valuable Player, to Houston in exchange for Chris Paul, two protected first-round picks and other draft considerations. \u201cEverything happened so quick once the Paul [George] trade happened,\u201d Westbrook said back in October. \u201cAfter that, obviously [there was] speculation and figuring out what\u2019s best for me, for the Thunder and figuring out what their plans were.\u201d Thunder general manager Sam Presti outlined where the team was headed in a July letter to OKC fans published by The Oklahoman . \u201cThis summer, the story of the Oklahoma City Thunder is transitioning to a new phase,\u201d Presti wrote. \u201cOver the last few weeks, we have parted ways with foundational players \u2014 people who have represented our city to the world, who have sacrificed for us and flourished on our behalf. Although this has been painful, I also believe that \u2014 given the circumstances \u2014 it was necessary. In saying goodbye to the past, we have begun to chart the future. The next great Thunder team is out there somewhere, but it will take time to seize and discipline to ultimately sustain.\u201d The current incarnation of the Thunder (21-16) certainly seems to be on the way. They reside at No. 7 in the Western Conference standings with a sizeable lead over the eighth-place San Antonio Spurs (16-20), and they\u2019ve gotten it done with five players averaging double figures in scoring in Gilgeous-Alexander (19.8), Dennis Schroder (18.5), Gallinari (18.0), Paul (16.6) and Steven Adams (11.9). The DNA of this current Oklahoma City squad also seems to be embedded with the clutch gene, too. The Thunder held a record of 22-24 last season in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, which ranked 16th in the NBA. They have finished games stronger this season by owning a 13-3 record since Nov. 25 in that area. In fact, the Thunder have five of the top 10 leaders in clutch plus-minus rating in Gilgeous-Alexander, Adams, Schroder, Paul and Gallinari. Paul, who has served this season as the consummate veteran leader for the young Thunder, leads all players with 103 clutch points on the season, while Gilgeous-Alexander (65) ranks in the top 10. Both guards are helping on the other end late in games with their 13 total clutch-time steals . Gallinari is tied for the second-most clutch 3-pointers (10), and Adams is tied for the second-most clutch rebounds (28). As a team, Oklahoma City\u2019s 286 clutch points ranks as the most in the NBA. \u201cWe have so many weapons on the court towards the end of the game,\u201d said Gilgeous-Alexander, after scoring 15 of his 25 points in the third quarter of a 109-103 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Jan. 2 in which the Thunder rallied back from a 14-point deficit. The win marked Oklahoma City\u2019s first in San Antonio during the regular season since Christmas of 2014. \u201cTeams can\u2019t really load up and they can\u2019t take certain things away from us, because it leads to other things for us,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander added. \u201cWe have been in this situation a lot this year and we\u2019re just getting better at it.\u201d They\u2019ve certainly proven as much. Oklahoma City outscored the Chicago Bulls 60-38 in the second half on Dec. 16 to overcome a 26-point deficit on the way to a 109-106 win. The club followed up on that the very next game with a 24-point comeback victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, which made Oklahoma City the only team in the last 20 years to rally back from back-to-back deficits of 24 points or more. Fast forward two games to Dec. 22, and the Thunder rallied from 18 down to stun the LA Clippers. The Thunder are currently tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most 15-point comeback wins this season (four). Paul characterized that \u201cas sort of the story of our team,\u201d while Gilgeous-Alexander mentioned the team\u2019s mentality in clutch situations is to \u201cjust focus on what we need to do. If at the end of the day, they make every shot and we don\u2019t make every shot, they\u2019ll still win no matter what. You\u2019ve just got to trust the game and trust the work.\u201d So far, that\u2019s proven to be a formula for success. When Westbrook returns to Chesapeake Energy Arena tonight in a Houston Rockets uniform, he\u2019s playing against a tough and gritty unit. He can expect a loud standing ovation from the home crowd. His former teammate George received an ovation on Dec. 22 when he came back to Oklahoma City last month, but Westbrook\u2019s reception will certainly be of higher volume. As a result of the Westbrook and George transactions, the Thunder own a stockpile of assets that make the future bright in Oklahoma City. The Thunder now hold a total of eight first-round draft picks over the next seven years, not to mention the club\u2019s own picks. Oklahoma City can also swap the least favorable of some of its own picks with Miami, Houston and the LA Clippers. It\u2019s also worth noting that other franchises continued runs of success after trading multiple All-Stars. So this isn\u2019t uncharted territory. Over a span of seven months from June of 2017 and January of 2018, the Clippers traded away both Paul and Blake Griffin, and embarked the next season on a playoff run. In 2011, the Denver Nuggets traded away Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups to the New York Knicks and ended up in the playoffs the next season. \u201cThe group\u2019s been really resilient and works hard,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cAll these guys are really professional. It\u2019s their job to come in here and do their work. Because it is a team, the importance of the relationships that are established inside the group are important. For us, there\u2019s nine new guys. So, it took a while to get to know each other, play with each other. It takes a lot of communication, a lot of work.\u201d * * * Michael C.

In Minnesota, Jarrett Culver has made the most of his increased playing time, averaging 14.5 points in the first four games this month. The No. 6 pick has struggled with his shot this season (37.8% overall, 25.4% on 3-pointers), but has continued to earn playing time thanks to his prowess on defense. But the new year has brought increased playing time for the Texas Tech product thanks to injuries to Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. Culver has been more aggressive with the extra minutes and finished his week with a career-high 24 points in a 119-112 loss to the Grizzlies on Tuesday night . Culver was 8-for-11 from the field, going 3-for-5 from beyond the arc, but Minnesota \u2014 which had won three of four \u2014 couldn\u2019t hold off the Grizzlies, who got 25 from star rookie Ja Morant. Two nights earlier, Culver showed off his defense, helping the Wolves pull out a 118-103 win in Cleveland . With Dante Exum exploding for 24 of his career-high 28 points in the second half, Culver got the call late in the game, and didn\u2019t disappoint. With Minnesota nursing a 10-point lead, Exum returned to the game with 4:14 left, but didn\u2019t score down the stretch as Culver stifled the Cavs\u2019 newest acquisition . \u201cHe stepped up to the challenge,\u201d Wolves forward Robert Covington said of the performance . \u201cMe being a defensive player, I\u2019m most happy because that step means evolution. I\u2019m glad he made it happen.\u201d Culver is clearly a work in progress as his overall shooting attests, but the results in the new year prove he\u2019s got a chance to be something special. In Toronto, another rookie \u2014 undrafted guard Terence Davis \u2014 had one of his best games of the season Wednesday night to save the Raptors in Charlotte . Davis, who has struggled of late and was even called out by coach Nick Nurse after Tuesday\u2019s 101-99 loss to the Blazers, scored a career-high 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the win vs. the Hornets. Davis made the most of his first career start, scoring 13 in the first quarter and six clutch points in overtime (hitting a pair of big 3s) to save the Raptors. Davis has had his moments this season, but clearly isn\u2019t about to let recent struggles shake his confidence. \u201cObviously, my play was terrible the last few games,\u201d Davis said after Wednesday\u2019s win . \u201cI take that as a challenge. What [Nurse] said there, I loved it. All of my coaches throughout my career have been like that, straightforward, no sugar-coating. And that\u2019s the way you want when you\u2019re a player. And the great thing about it is in this league you have games after games. So we had another game the next day which was a blessing in my eyes. So I just wanted to come out and show Nick Nurse and the Raptors I can play a little bit.\u201d Davis certainly showed them, finishing 8-for-16 overall (4-for-8 on 3s) with zero turnovers in 37 big minutes \u2014 and Nurse loved the way his undrafted rookie responded to the challenge. \u201cHe was really good,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t that easy to figure out who to play with all these guys out constantly \u2026 With me, as you\u2019ve seen a few times already this year, I\u2019m gonna rattle your cage if you deserve to have it rattled, but I\u2019m gonna put my arm around you the next day and get on with it because I believe in the kid. It was only in his best interests and the team\u2019s best interests to do that and we did it.\u201d * * * Last week: No. 1 The Grizzlies have won three straight and have a 5-2 record since Christmas, and Morant has dazzled, most notably in last Saturday\u2019s 140-114 rout of the Clippers in L.A. Morant finished with 22 points and nine assists as Memphis pulled off one of its biggest wins of the season. \u201cI think he\u2019s exceeded everyone else\u2019s expectations,\u201d Jaren Jackson said of his teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s a special talent. He moves without the ball, gets back on defense, set screens and gets the ball to guys when they\u2019re open.\u201d In four games this week, the No. 2 pick averaged 20.8 points and 7.5 assists while hitting at 63.3% overall and 40% on 3s. The Grizzlies are gaining fans with every win, and a sustained playoff push will only build Morant\u2019s budding star status. Last week: Not ranked As mentioned above, Culver is putting up big numbers and this week his most impressive stats might have come on defense. Culver averaged 2.3 steals in three games this week , thanks to four big swipes against the Cavs. He also had a pair of blocks and finished that victory with a plus-33 rating in 28 minutes. In three games this week, Culver averaged 16.0 ppg while hitting 50% from the field and going 6-for-17 on 3-pointers. Those shooting numbers that will have fans in Minnesota excited about their young prospect. Last week: Not ranked Doumbouya grabbed headlines with an early entry for Dunk of the Decade , but he\u2019s doing more than just dunk on guys. With Blake Griffin out indefinitely , the 19-year-old is stepping up with his increased minutes. The 6-foot-8 forward has scored in double-digits in four straight games with averages of 13.0 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 1.5 spg and 33.2 mpg. In those four starts, the big man from Guinea \u2014 who played in France before being taken at No. 15 \u2014 is shooting 47.6% from the field (31.3% on 3-pointers) while earning some praise from coach Dwane Casey. \u201cThe injuries have expedited it,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe young man has done an excellent job, but let\u2019s don\u2019t get carried away. There are enough mistakes to be made by all of our young guys and that\u2019s what happens when you use young players. He\u2019d sone some good things. I love the way he\u2019s cutting, the way he\u2019s rebounding. He\u2019s made some open shots, so that\u2019s good.\u201d  Last week: No. 4 Washington has missed his last six 3-point attempts and is just 2-for-10 in four games this week, but he finished the week with a double-double (12 points, 12 rebounds) in Charlotte\u2019s 112-110 overtime loss to the Raptors. Despite the recent cold stretch, Washington averaged 12.8 ppg and 8.3 rpg this week while shooting 48.9% overall.  Last week: Not ranked Garland seems to be finding his groove as the Cavs\u2019 season seems to be slipping into chaos. He\u2019s scored in double-digits in six straight and averaged 15.3 points while hitting 37.8% on 3-pointers during that span . Garland said earlier this week his confidence is \u201cat an all-time high\u201d and the reads are becoming easier. \u201cThe game is definitely slowing down for me,\u201d Garland said . \u201cPick-and-roll reads are getting easier.

Westbrook set for return to OKC In 11 seasons, Russell Westbrook amassed all kinds of stats , won a Kia MVP and went on a run to The Finals with the Oklahoma City Thunder. After being dealt to the Houston Rockets this summer, his return is finally here ( 9:30 ET, TNT ). Emotions are sure to run high for Westbrook and his former fans and, all that aside, this should be a great game. Since reaching .500 on Dec. 20, the Thunder rank No. 3 in guard scoring (76 ppg) \u2014 two spots higher than Houston in that category. The Rockets are coming off a thrilling game in Atlanta last night that featured an epic James Harden vs. Trae Young duel . 2. Celtics, Sixers set for showdown The lack of Joel Embiid (left finger injury) in this one takes a little luster off the matchup ( 7 ET, TNT ). It remains an interesting game nonetheless, though, because of the direction the Celtics and Sixers are heading of late. Philadelphia is fresh off a win against Oklahoma City (the game in which Embiid first injured his finger), while Boston has lost two in a row after notching eight wins in nine games. 3. Fallout from Butler-Warren scuffle If you missed it last night, the Heat-Pacers game was a bit of a blowout. Miami won 122-108 on the road, but the bigger storyline from this one was the third-quarter war of words and shoves the Heat\u2019s Jimmy Butler and T.J. Warren got into. Warren was ultimately ejected from the game for his actions against Butler during that dust-up and it will be interesting to see what happens next in this \u2014 either with more social media commentary or perhaps a rebuttal from Warren. 4. On this date: Lakers\u2019 streak ends From Nov. 5, 1971 until Jan. 9, 1972, the Lakers made NBA history with their run of 33 straight victories. However, that streak came to an end in Milwaukee as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar notched 39 points and 20 rebounds to power a 120-104 Bucks win .

Harden tallied 41 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the Houston Rockets\u2019 122-115 victory over the Hawks in Atlanta. Young countered with 42 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. Obviously, 40-point triple-doubles are rare, but prolific scorer Harden now has 15 in his career and trails only the legendary Oscar Robertson (22) for the most in NBA history. It was Harden\u2019s second 40-point triple-double in a row , and his second triple-double of the season. He posted 44 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in the Rockets\u2019 win over the 76ers Friday night. Young also has two triple-doubles this season and three in his career. Although the Hawks are the worst team in the Eastern Conference and 3-11 vs. the West this season, Young continues to have a stellar season. He has six 40-point games this season \u2014 the most in the East and the most by an Atlanta player since Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins logged eight of them in 1992-93 .

In an interview with Shams Charania of Stadium, Oladipo says he\u2019s ready to return to the Indiana Pacers\u2019 lineup for the first time since Jan. 23, 2019. He has been out of the mix since then when he suffered a ruptured right quad tendon in a 110-106 win against the Toronto Raptors. While Jan. 29 is the target date, Oladipo told Stadium he remains open to that potentially changing. \u201cThat could change, that might not change, who knows,\u201d Oladipo told Stadium. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely good to have something to look forward to after 12 months of wondering and hoping and not being sure. Twelve months of the unknown. \u201cTo actually, you know, have something and a goal to look forward to is pretty astronomical for me in this process. I\u2019m way stronger now than I was before, especially mentally. I just feel like nothing can phase me. I\u2019ve been through the worst. My better days lie ahead.\u201d Prior to his injury last season, Oladipo was averaging 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 36 games for Indiana. At the time of his injury, he ranked third in the NBA in clutch points with 5.1 ppg , was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 5 and was named an All-Star for the second straight season . (The Brooklyn Nets\u2019 D\u2019Angelo Russell ended up replacing him in the All-Star Game.) Oladipo says he\u2019s understandably excited to be back on the court for the Pacers, who are 23-14 and the No. 6 team in the Eastern Conference. Indiana has stayed in the thick of the East chase thanks to standout seasons from Domantas Sabonis and offseason additions TJ Warren and Malcolm Brogdon. Throughout the offseason, Oladipo continued his rehab work and said in August he was looking forward to a fresh start in 2019-20 . In November , Oladipo practice with the Pacers\u2019 G League affiliate, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants and took part in some Pacers practices in late October . Back then, he remained non-committal on when he\u2019d suit up again for the team. A report circulated late last month that Oladipo was targeting a late January return to the lineup and he\u2019s been working toward that ever since. As for the game against Chicago \u2014 should it come to pass as planned \u2014 Oladipo is ready for the emotions of that moment. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very, very emotional night,\u201d Oladipo told Stadium. \u201cI think more so for everybody that supported me that\u2019s coming to watch than for me. I\u2019m just going to go out there and play basketball what I\u2019ve been playing since I was 4 years old. \u201cGranted, it\u2019s been a minute since I played in an NBA game. But at the end of the day, after I get my feet wet and go up and down the floor \u2026 and the game just starts flowing, I\u2019ll just be playing basketball again. I know for everyone else it\u2019s going to be pretty emotional. I\u2019m looking forward to that night.

Dallas Mavericks forward Luka Doncic is dominating every night and having a Kia MVP-caliber season at 20 years old. But while Young and Doncic have been excellent, there\u2019s another gifted player from the 2018 Draft class still capable of and hungry for stardom. \u201cI want to be an MVP in the league one day,\u201d Michael Porter Jr. told NBA.com, adding that his \u201copportunity will come.\u201d He faced Young on Wednesday and will battle Doncic for the first time tonight ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ). The Denver Nuggets rookie ended 2019 with his first career start and dropped a team-high 19 points, fueling a 120-115 win over the Sacramento Kings. He started 2020 off with another lights out performance by registering 25 points on 11-for-12 shooting as Denver knocked off the Indiana Pacers 124-116 . It was a career night against a formidable opponent on the road, which is why he was doused with a cooler full of ice-cold water afterwards. Porter\u2019s red-carpet smile was gleaming, and he spent most of the night responding to text messages and answering congratulatory calls from his family once he got home. Young, who happens to be one of Porter\u2019s close friends and former AAU teammate, was also among those offering praise. The Hawks\u2019 young star viewed it as a breakout performance. Two nights later, however, Porter was back on the bench, watching as his team suffered a stunning loss to the injury-depleted Washington Wizards. The rookie forward sat the entire second half excluding garbage time. It was a puzzling situation considering his outburst 48 hours prior, but it was simply a microcosm of the patience Porter has been forced to maintain over the last couple of years. \u201cIt was cool to start, but I knew that wasn\u2019t gonna be a long-term thing at this point,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI just have to be ready with coming off the bench and give our bench a spark. I\u2019m just happy to play. I think my role will continue to grow as long as I work hard and do the right things.\u201d The 21-year-old Missouri native has undergone two back surgeries, with foot and knee issues slowing down his comeback process as well. The unfortunate back injuries caused him to miss 90% of his lone season at Missouri and his first year in the NBA. It\u2019s the reason he landed in Denver with the No. 14 overall pick in the 2018 draft despite being rated the top recruit in high school. Teams that were once smitten by his skillset became skeptics of his health, and his stock fell. He watched as Young, Doncic and others were selected among the top five, a category Porter was projected to be in just a year prior to Draft night. Despite the setbacks, Porter\u2019s trajectory continues to trend in the right direction. When given playing time, the  physically talented combo forward  has at times been able to showcase the offensive arsenal that once made him a McDonald\u2019s All-American MVP. In his career-best outing against Indiana , Porter\u2019s finishes at the rim were dazzling. His ability to score over defenders with his 6-foot-10 frame was mesmerizing, and his long step-backs when wanting separation were lethal. There\u2019s only been three instances this season in which he\u2019s played at least 21 minutes . In those three games, he averaged 19.6 points. And while it\u2019s always dangerous to extrapolate small sample sizes \u2014 his 75% shooting from the field in those games is impressive, yet obviously unsustainable \u2014 his average of 20.2 points per 36 minutes would lead a deep Nuggets team in scoring. His flashes of late have Denver fans craving more. A healthy and unleashed Porter has the tools to be a 25-ppg scorer this decade, especially once he learns to supplement his numbers at the charity stripe. One of his weaknesses has been his inability to draw fouls (he\u2019s had just one game with multiple trips to the free-throw line). The elite scorers know how to initiate contact instead of eschewing it \u2014 one of a few nuances of the game he wishes he studied more during his redshirt season. \u201cI wish I had paid attention a little more last year,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI wish I could say that I was really paying attention to the NBA game, but really I wasn\u2019t paying attention that much. I should have, but I was just focused on rehab.\u201d Other elements of his game that need improvement are on the defensive end. The Nuggets allow 112.9 points per 100 possessions when Porter is on the floor, the highest mark among players in Denver\u2019s rotation. At his height, he\u2019s required to guard multiple positions and should seek that challenge the way Kevin Durant has later in his career. Sharpening his ball-handling and play-making skills should also be near the top of his 2020 vision board (he\u2019s averaging more turnovers than assists). Ask Porter what parts of his game needs polishing, and he\u2019ll simply say \u201ceverything.\u201d The Nuggets have exercised prudence in bringing him along this season, and he\u2019s integrated himself nicely. His path has been different than the other 13 lottery picks in his class, yet his sky-high ceiling remains. \u201cI have all the highest aspirations.\u201d Porter Jr. said. \u201cI want to win a championship, I think we have a championship-level team when we play the right way and that\u2019s our goal for this year. Me personally, my opportunity will come. I\u2019ve just gotta stay hungry and stay humble.\u201d * * * Khari Arnold wrote this story. You can e-mail him  here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

They also heralded a partnership that now thrives as an ultimate showcase for basketball. Today, the NBA has more than 430 million followers across all league, team and player platforms, one of the largest and most vibrant social media fan bases in the world. NBA videos on the platform were viewed more than 1 billion times during the 2018-19 season, an all-time high. Players like LeBron James (the most followed U.S. athlete on Twitter), Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry have embraced the platform, offering fans an inside look at their everyday lives. The NBA and Twitter extended their partnership before the 2019-20 season to deepen the engagement with this passionate community. Fans now have access to even more NBA content, including the NBA on TNT\u2019s #NBATwitterLive livestreams, alternative commentaries, highlights, and real-time interactions with the league, players and each other.

And fans still have access to popular features that were introduced previously, including behind-the-scenes content and weekly #NBATwitter recaps. Also, the #NBATwitterLive stream continues to show a variety of regular-season games, as well as the All-Star Game and at least 16 playoff games, including the entire Western Conference Finals.

It is accompanied by commentary from 2016 NBA champion and 13-year NBA veteran Channing Frye and a host of influencers. The NBA was an early adopter of Twitter, which debuted in 2006. Since the league\u2019s first tweet, it found that including video photos and other interactive elements significantly increased fan engagement. By 2018, a tweet containing video of Derrick Rose scoring a career-high 50 points received more than 1.3 million views. A video of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver revealing the NBA jersey of the future at All-Star 2019 garnered 4.2 million views.

Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t look like he will be out of the mix for too long. This morning, the Lakers said the MRI Davis had revealed a gluteus maximus contusion. Davis is questionable for the Lakers\u2019 next game and will travel with the team. The Lakers face the Mavericks on Friday ( 9:45 p.m. ET, ESPN ) and Thunder on Saturday ( 8 ET, League Pass ). Shams Charania of The Athletic was the first to report that Davis would travel with the team on its road trip. Davis was knocked off balance and hit the floor while attempting to defend Julius Randle\u2019s drive to the basket with 2:45 remaining in the third. He remained on the court throughout the remainder of the ensuing timeout before gingerly making his way back to the dressing room. At the time, the Lakers announced Davis had suffered a sacral contusion, a bruise of the sacrum bone near the bottom of the spine and was due for an MRI on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go through additional testing, and we\u2019ll have an update for you guys (Wednesday),\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said after the game. \u201cFingers crossed, pray for the best.

Another 60-pointer from Harden? The last time James Harden saw the Hawks, he lit them up for a career-best 60 points on Nov. 30 . Even more amazing? He pulled off the feat in just 31 minutes with a shooting performance that included 16-for-24 overall, 8-for-14 on 3-pointers and 20-for-23 on free throws. As the Hawks host the Rockets tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), there could be reason for concern for another Harden outburst. From Oct. 22 to Nov. 29, Atlanta ranked 26th in Defensive Rating , a category they rank 28th in since the Harden 60-point game . The good news for the Hawks? At least Russell Westbrook is out for this game. 2. Heat, Pacers set for showdown Indiana hosts Miami ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and, frankly, needs to fare better against winning teams this season. The Pacers are 6-9 against teams over .500 with their last such win coming on New Year\u2019s Eve vs. the (Joel Embiid-less) Sixers . The Heat, on the flip side, are a stellar 14-7 against teams over. 500 \u2014 which is one of the best such records in the NBA. Pacers point guard Malcolm Brogdon is questionable with a lower back injury and keep an eye on an excellent in-the-paint matchup between the Heat\u2019s Bam Adebayo and the Pacers\u2019 Domantas Sabonis. 3. Nuggets end road trip in Dallas A mere two games separate the sixth place Mavericks from the second place Nuggets in the Western Conference. A looming showdown ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ) in Dallas means all eyes will be on Kia MVP types Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic. Denver\u2019s Jokic is rounding into form of late and, since Dec. 1 is averaging 21.9 points, 9.3 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game. As for Doncic, he already has 11 triple-doubles this season, including two straight and three in his last six games . Denver is looking to end its five-game road trip with a win, having logged victories in Atlanta and Indiana on the trip. 4. Jazz try to keep pace in West The West chase often provides little room to advance. Case in point? Try Utah. It has won six in a row, hosts the Knicks next ( 9 ET, League Pass ) \u2026 and has only moved from sixth to fifth place in the West during that time. The Jazz are seeing some serious improvement on offense during the win streak, though, which began on Dec. 26. Since then, Utah ranks No. 2 in Offensive Rating , No. 1 in Effective Field Goal percentage , No. 2 in True Shooting percentage and No. 2 in 3-point percentage . 5. Bucks look to get back in gear The Bucks got their season series with the Spurs out of the way, falling short in Monday\u2019s matchup in San Antonio . But beyond that hiccup, things have been superb for Milwaukee since Nov. 14 (it is 26-3 in that span). Draymond Green will be back for the Warriors tonight as they host the Bucks ( 10 ET, ESPN ) and will likely draw the unenviable task of guarding Giannis Antetokounmpo. Last season, Antetokounmpo had his way with the Warriors on the road (24 points, nine rebounds, four assists) and has been hot of late (27.8 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 4.8 apg in his last five games ).

(AP) \u2014 When Zion Williamson finished his first full-court, five-on-five work since returning to practice last week, he spent extra one-on-one time with assistant coach Fred Vinson on the free throw line. After all, the Pelicans are going to need Williamson to make free throws that matter sooner than later. Coach Alvin Gentry wasn\u2019t ready to specify a date when Williamson will make his NBA regular season debut \u2013 other than to virtually rule out Wednesday night\u2019s game against Chicago \u2013 but did say Williamson generally looked \u201cfine\u201d in practice. \u201cObviously conditioning is going to be the big thing there, but you know, you don\u2019t lose your feel for the game and he\u2019s a really good passer, a willing passer, so all of that stuff is going to be there,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get yourself in basketball shape, conditioning-wise, and that\u2019s going to be a process. \u201cHe\u2019s eager to be out there and all of his teammates are eager for him to be out there, but it\u2019s a step by step process that we\u2019ve got to take so that it\u2019s done the right way,\u201d Gentry addded. \u201cThere\u2019s no date, per se, but we\u2019re hoping that it\u2019s soon.\u201d After the Pelicans host the Bulls, they hit the road for games at New York on Friday, Boston on Saturday and Detroit on Monday before returning home to play Utah on Jan. 16.

Veteran guard E\u2019Twaun Moore described Williamson as a \u201cfreak athlete,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s good to see him back running, getting up and down on the court, mixing with the guys.\u201d"},{"id":29559,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-waive-marquese-chriss","date":"2020-01-07","title":"Warriors waive forward Marquese Chriss","content":" SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Forward Marquese Chriss was waived by the Warriors on Tuesday, providing room for Golden State to sign Damion Lee for the remainder of the season. Lee was in his final days of a two-way contract that allowed him to split time with the Santa Cruz Warriors of the G League. Chriss provided a boost for the injury-plagued Warriors after signing as a free agent in late September, but the team faced tough decisions given the constraints of trying to keep two-way players Lee and Ky Bowman.

But the six-time All-Star reportedly is not expected to leave Los Angeles. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes reports that Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 leading scorer, rebounder and shotblocker this season, recently declined a four-year maximum contract extension the team offered him. Davis is bypassing the in-season extension in favor of entering unrestricted free agency this summer, Haynes reports. The news was also reported by Tania Ganguli of the Los Angeles Times. According to Haynes, no one around the league expects Davis to leave the Lakers after just one season. The decision to decline the extension was made solely out of salary-cap implications and because Davis wants to focus on the 2019-20 campaign, Haynes writes. Davis holds a $28.7 million player option for the 2020-21 season that he is expected to decline. Per Haynes, Davis\u2019 agent Rich Paul delivered the news to the Lakers after the team\u2019s shootaround for tonight\u2019s game against the New York Knicks ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ). Last summer, Davis waived his no-trade clause in order to complete the blockbuster trade that sent him from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Lakers. In doing so, he was restricted from signing an extension for six months. That restriction was removed on Jan. 7. Davis is averaging 27.7 points, 9.5 rebounds, 2.6 blocks and 1.5 steals per game, stats which are more than on par with his career averages of 24 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.4 bpg and 1.4 spg. The Lakers, at 29-7, are the No. 1 team in the Western Conference and have the NBA\u2019s second-best record behind the 32-6 Milwaukee Bucks. The news of Davis opting into free agency in 2020 is hardly a surprise for those who have followed his saga closely over the years. In a 2019 interview with Sports Illustrated , Paul said his client would be going into free agency this summer regardless of where he played the 2019-20 campaign.

He was childish. \u201cI wasn\u2019t acting like a 31-year-old, I was acting like a 13-year-old,\u201d Love said. \u201cThat was not me.\u201d The Cavaliers star forward spoke openly and in depth Tuesday for the first time since an outburst on the bench in Toronto last week and for showing up his teammates and coaches during a loss to Oklahoma City on Saturday . Love threw his arms up in disgust several times on the floor, fired a hard pass in anger and had his back turned on defense as one of the Thunder\u2019s players streaked past him for a basket. Also, before that game, Love got into a verbal exchange with general manager Koby Altman because he was angry at being fined for losing his cool against the Raptors on Dec. 31 . Love said the situation was overblown in the media and that he and Altman spoke before Sunday\u2019s game against Minnesota and are on good terms. \u201cI went in there and talked to Koby about it in conversation,\u201d Love said following the morning shootaround as the Cavs prepared to host Detroit. \u201cCame to the arena, Koby and I were great, gave him a (fist) pound right when I came in. There was no altercation, there was no screaming match, you can ask him, that\u2019s what it was.\u201d Love has been the subject of trade rumors almost since the moment he arrived in Cleveland five years ago, and it\u2019s likely the young and rebuilding Cavs will deal him before the Feb. 6 deadline to add future assets. Not long after LeBron James left as a free agency following the 2017 season, the Cavs signed Love to a four-year, $120 million contract . They wanted him to be the center piece of their rebuild but things haven\u2019t gone exactly as planned as the team has made a coaching change and move several veteran players. Love could be next. But he has no regrets about staying with Cleveland. \u201cNo,\u201d he said when asked if he wished he hadn\u2019t signed the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s there. Everybody wants to paint a narrative that I didn\u2019t want to be here and just signed it because it was there. No, I\u2019ve always wanted to be here. I don\u2019t know what the next few weeks are going to hold and this has been a frustrating situation and I know this is a team that\u2019s rebuilding and wants to go young. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted that. Let the chips fall where they may.\u201d Love has been open in the past about his struggles with anxiety and depression. He\u2019s become a national advocate for mental wellness. The stress of the past two seasons have taken a toll, but he said he\u2019s learning to cope when faced with challenges. \u201cI think you have to see all sides of it, and I\u2019ve had to take a step back the last number of years and do that as well,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing things in their entirety when things are bad, when things are kind of not at a place where you want them to be is super hard. I think that transcends the basketball court, professional sports, any walk of life. I think we can all be better.\u201d Love acknowledged his failings over the past weeks and vowed to learn from them. He\u2019s had a hard time coping with the reality that he\u2019s not going to win another NBA title with Cleveland, but that can\u2019t affect the ways he acts toward teammates, coaches, fans and media members.

The svelte and determined Jokic on display against the Atlanta Hawks looks much more like the player many tout as the NBA\u2019s best passing big man and a matchup nightmare who can control the action for his team without scoring at a high clip. He did that, too, on Monday, finishing with a career-high 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block in the Nuggets\u2019 123-115 win . \u201cJust the efficiency in which he does it: 16-25 (shooting overall), 4-8 from three, if he would\u2019ve made some more foul shots he would have had his first 50-point game,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201c[I] just liked how aggressive he was. Obviously we force-fed him, tried to get him the ball in the post. He had it going, from all areas, from earlier on in the game so that was great to see. And the best part about it too, was that all his teammates were finding him.\u201d Malone is just happy to see Jokic get back to what made him so effective last season, when Denver earned the No. 2 seed in the West before losing Game 7 of the conference semifinals at home to Portland. Jokic, of course, is working in the moment \u2026 especially after Denver was humbled in Washington on Saturday . \u201cI like the win for us more because we are kind of inconsistent right now, and I think that winning is more important than my career high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I was aggressive, I was making shots, and I scored a lot, but I think that the win is more important.\u201d Jokic\u2019s unselfish nature sometimes makes him a reluctant scorer on a Nuggets team that has plenty of other scoring options. (Will Barton smoked Atlanta for a season-high 28 on his 29th birthday, improving Denver to 21-4 when he has 13 or more points.) The Hawks tried to bait Jokic into taking shots that he missed the first time they played, a 125-121 loss on Nov. 12 when Jokic shot 7-for-19. He didn\u2019t need a push from Malone or his teammates the second time around. \u201cYou know what\u2019s funny? I don\u2019t think you have to tell Nikola that,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHonestly, you could see early on that Alex Len, they were kind of giving him \u2018dare shots\u2019 and they dared him to 47 (points). \u201cThat\u2019s not a knock on them. First time against them, they let him shoot those shots and he wasn\u2019t making them. Tonight, he was and that was a big reason we were able to pull this one out.\u201d If the Nuggets hope to recapture last season\u2019s magic, they\u2019ll need more yeoman-like work from Jokic. They\u2019ll need more of what they got against an Atlanta team that had no answers for this slimmer, trimmer and much more aggressive version of \u201cThe Joker.\u201d Odds and ends: Devin Booker\u2019s improvement in his fifth NBA season has been evident, even if the Suns\u2019 record hasn\u2019t reflected his gains. Booker has become more of a complete player without sacrificing any of the scoring prowess that has made him one of the league\u2019s toughest covers. He broke a franchise record in a loss to Memphis Sunday , becoming the first player in franchise history to record six consecutive games of 30 or more points. Charles Barkley and Charlie Scott shared the previous mark \u2026 Keep an eye on Markelle Fultz in Orlando. The former No. 1 overall pick appears to have found his game again. He scored a career-high 25 points to lead the Magic past Brooklyn Monday, their third win in four games. Fultz has started 15 of the 19 games he\u2019s played in and is averaging a career-best 26.4 minutes . While points and assists are usually the most pertinent numbers for point guards, playing time is the focus for Fultz \u2026 Good luck figuring out what\u2019s going on with the Philadelphia 76ers these days, even after they snapped a four-game losing streak with Monday\u2019s win over Oklahoma City . There\u2019s chatter from everywhere, which makes it hard to know who is directing their comments where. Joel Embiid had his say in the finger pointing (before that nasty dislocation Monday night ), and Al Horford, Josh Richardson and coach Brett Brown have all weighed in, too. The one guy who hasn\u2019t had much to say is Ben Simmons, the presumed target of much of the scrutiny \u2026 Yes, those were \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants you heard in Washington Monday for Wizards backup point guard Ish Smith (technically no relation, but we\u2019re always open to new members of the family). For the second straight game, Smith led the Wizards\u2019 bench mob as they pulled of an upset. This time, they beat the a Celtics squad playing its third straight game without All-Star point guard Kemba Walker. Smith dropped 27 on the Celtics and 32 on Denver Saturday. Over the past two games, Washington\u2019s bench has outscored foes 141-55. Journey into Luka-land: Just a quick reminder that Luka Doncic does things that apparently only Luka Doncic does. The Mavericks star picked up his league-leading 11th triple-double of the season in Monday\u2019s win over Chicago. He has nine 30-point triple-doubles this season. The rest of the league combined has eight. His 19 (and counting) career triple-doubles \u2014 all of which have come before turning 21 \u2014 is more than Magic Johnson (7) and LeBron James (5) combined. How many more will Doncic pile up before he turns 21 on Feb. 28? Players of the Week : T he committee didn\u2019t have to deliberate over its selections this week, as Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James are no-brainers. They\u2019ve both been at their wicked best from the start of the season and started 2020 in style. Forget their individual numbers (which are outstanding, of course). Look instead at the numbers both of them are focused on: wins and losses. The Bucks (32-6) and Lakers (29-7) are locked in a season-long chase for the NBA\u2019s top record and the home-court advantage throughout The Finals that comes with it. That\u2019s a real prize.  Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . From:  Zaya Jan. 5, 2020 | 2:07 a.m. I want to confidently vote LeBron James for 2019 MVP. This is because he is now at 35 years old and has played 17 seasons whilst always being contested by high-level fellow candidates. Although I know the rest of the guys are all outstanding players, however, they\u2019re all too young and lacking experience. They are not qualified enough this time and don\u2019t make the cut simply because they don\u2019t match the basketball mindset LeBron has. For the last 25 years I\u2019ve been playing, watching, and analyzing basketball players. I have always thought that LeBron was a star player that was ahead of the game, and I have no doubt that he is worthy of 2019 MVP. * * * My response: Happy New Year, Zaya. As you might already be aware, you are not the first person to correspond here in support of LeBron James. It is an outstanding group of MVP candidates we\u2019re working with this season. And given the injuries to regulars \u2014 such as two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry and fellow Kia MVP Kevin Durant \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to see guys like Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker and others join the party. But LeBron rejoining the top group after an injury-plagued 2018-19 season should have been expected. From: Doreynoldstx Jan. 1, 2020 | 5:31 p.m. I have to laugh at all the idiotic rhetoric used against Harden in this list. \u201cAbusing the power of free throws\u201d \u2026 LOL. Giannis is averaging more free throws per drive! Take away Harden\u2019s free throws and he still is the scoring leader. I\u2019m tired of this stuff you media shills spin. He\u2019s the best player in the NBA and it\u2019s laughable it\u2019s even close to you guys. He\u2019s averaging more points per game since Wilt Chamberlain on incredible efficiency! His field goal percentage was low to kick off the season, but has been scorching since \u2014 despite being full-on double teamed every game. The media is missing out on the best player since Michael Jordan because it\u2019s cool to spew garbage non-facts. Stop hating the best. The only reason he doesn\u2019t have rings right now is because of the legendary stacked Warriors teams. Remove your blinders and do some actual fact-searching. Nobody is touching Harden this year \u2014 and he\u2019s also playing respectable defense, too. * * * My response: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the rhetoric being used against Harden that is behind the backlash you are talking about. And we \u201cmedia shills\u201d are not united in our belief that there are others who are more worthy of the Kia MVP hardware based on anyone\u2019s rhetoric. Harden\u2019s greatest successes ( his MVP , leading the Rockets to the best record in the league and the West finals two years ago ) have all been tempered by the fact that he\u2019s seemed to come up short at the end of those seasons. You can debate it all you want, blame whoever you\u2019d like and cry foul forever. But the facts are the facts. And as good as Harden is and has been, your assertion that he\u2019s the \u201cbest player since Jordan\u201d is a statement I\u2019m sure plenty of folks would love to debate you on. From:  Hollis Pettway Dec. 31, 2019 | 10:19 p.m. My issue is the non-specific nature of the MVP award. The criteria is so subjective that it\u2019s hard, as a fan, to be satisfied with the result most of the time. Harden should be going for his second or third MVP right now. The process is more frustrating than satisfying. Such a prestigious award should have more clearly defined guidelines for the voters, who are often all over the place when expressing the reasons for their choice. What are your thoughts \/ explanation? * * * My response: You nailed it, Hollis. The biggest frustration for voters such as myself and many of my fellow voters is that we don\u2019t have a set criteria to use as an evaluation tool or guideline.  We\u2019re all coming from different value sets to try and come up with the right choice. No one\u2019s viewpoint is wrong necessarily, but each of our definitions for what constitutes a true MVP is going to be wildly different when you are talking about a constituency of 120 or so voters.  For the most part I think we get it right. How we get there, though, remains the murkiest part of the process.  Thanks for bringing up such a salient point. From: Happy Jan. 1, 2020 | 1:50 p.m. It is going to be hard this season to determine which player is gonna win MVP this year. Luka Doncic is putting up crazy numbers every night. James Harden is practically putting up 40-plus points a night. And Giannis leading the Bucks to the No. 1 seed the East. Here is my list for MVP: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Luka Doncic 3. James Harden 4. LeBron James 5. Anthony Davis 6. Jimmy Butler 7. Pascal Siakam 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Kemba Walker 10. Donovan Mitchell Lastly, do you think the Bucks could pull off winning the championship this year? * * * My response: Solid list, Happy. And yes, the Bucks absolutely could win it all this season. The Raptors showed us last season that a team with a single superstar (Kawhi Leonard) and a supporting cast cooking at the right time can get there and do the unthinkable. You need a willing dance partner in The Finals, too. The Warriors literally crumbling under the weight of five straight Finals trips certainly worked in the Raptors\u2019 favor. From: Noam Eber Jan. 1, 2020 | 11:56 a.m. I get that you want to praise LeBron for how good he is playing at his age. But the MVP is the best player \u2014 not the player that is doing the best for their age or height. You also have completely disrespected Harden, too. I like most of your lists, but I think you sometimes over-highlight rising stars for public opinion and you overlook those who are actually in their prime. I think you should probably swap Harden and LeBron and your list would be good. I also think you need to look at people who are good \u2014 not those who have potential or are good for their age. * * * My response: I hear you, Noam. The top group can get a bit stagnant. But there\u2019s a reason for that; those are the best players, the guys who do it night in and night out. It\u2019s difficult to crack into that top group of candidates because not everyone is as consistently great. I say it all the time, people don\u2019t have an adequate appreciation for just how difficult it is to play at an elite level over a sustained period of time, let alone year after year. Ask some of the players who flash, guys who have a good five or six game stretch but cannot consistently perform at the highest level. There are levels to this stuff. From: David Rosen Jan. 1, 2020 | 11:31 a.m. I am a big fan of your MVP ladders. My only concern is that this week you put LeBron at No. 5. He is the anchor of the team and he orchestrates the Lakers\u2019 offense. Then, you have Anthony Davis at No. 4 \u2026 I don\u2019t believe AD is doing more than LeBron to have him ahead of him in the rankings. Here is my ladder: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Kemba Walker 7. Anthony Davis 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Paul George 10. Domantas Sabonis * * * My response: David, I\u2019m not going to argue the AD\/LeBron issue, not after looking at your list. It\u2019s obvious there is little that could be done to change your mind. In fact, given the number of players you have ranked ahead of Davis, there\u2019s little that anyone could say or do to convince you otherwise. I believe Davis and LeBron belong in the top tier of candidates. The Lakers\u2019 overall success with those two superstars is at the center of everything they do. I\u2019ll continue to let their results prove the point. From: Trace Edinborough Dec. 31, 2019 | 1:26 p.m. Good afternoon. Firstly, season\u2019s greetings and a prosperous New Year to you and yours. Just a quick comment pertaining to the current and ongoing NBA MVP discussion. (As a disclaimer, I am a huge LeBron fan for both his efforts on and off the court.) I firmly believe that at this stage in the season, LeBron should the leading candidate for MVP. Firstly, although he is playing with AD, his \u201cteam\u201d is basically brand new without a legitimate third opinion. He has become their point guard and his defense is significantly better this year. The Lakers are No. 1 in the Western Conference and many reporters (including you) have always factored the importance of the leading team in the West when considering the MVP.  Equally important, what he is doing at this stage of his career is simply amazing. LeBron\u2019s team with its current roster needs him more than they perhaps realize. I am not taking anything away from Giannis and James Harden, but what LeBron is doing \u2014 and if it continues \u2014 should solidify his selection as the MVP. I would also like to note that he has been robbed in previous years. Thus, I hope writers truly give this man a fair and reasonable chance on this year\u2019s MVP selection. * * * My response: Not a whole lot to argue with there, Trace. I can imagine there are others who would love to debate you point for point. Some people love a good fight above all else. I\u2019m about peace this year and not arguing for the sake of arguing. I\u2019ll let the community speak on it \u2026 From: Bas Ali Dec. 31, 2019 | 6:20 p.m. Hold the heck up! Here is my MVP Ladder 1.LeBron James 2.Luka Doncic 3.Giannis Antetokounmpo 4.Anthony Davis 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Kemba Walker 8. Paul George 9. Joel Embiid 10. Chris Paul I didn\u2019t put Harden in it because he travels and flops and the refs don\u2019t care. * * * My response: Short and sweet, huh? Back at you, Ali. From: Christopher Habrelewicz Dec. 31, 2019 | 7:25 p.m. This is Christopher Habrelewicz (known as Madness With A Twist on YouTube ) and I feel as if most people are overrating some of these players on this list and not giving others their just due. My MVP list would be as follows: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Anthony Davis 3. Luka Doncic 4. James Harden 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. LeBron James 7. Paul George 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Jayson Tatum Honestly, this ranking is based on everyone being healthy and playing how they currently are. Giannis is unstoppable and a monster. Anthony Davis deserves more love based on how improved his stats are becoming by being on a playoff-caliber roster. Luka is having an incredible sophomore season, despite most players during their second year going through a sophomore slump. James Harden\u2019s numbers are incredible \u2026 and also kinda overrated based on the fact of him getting to the free-throw line so much. Kawhi Leonard should be top 5 for his great defense and incredible efficiency. LeBron is deserving of No. 6 because AD is making him the best passer so far in the league. Paul George was an MVP candidate last season and is doing great on this Clippers team alongside Kawhi. Jokic is highly underrated and on this Denver Nuggets team, they might be heading for a better record than last season. Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum are also under the radar a lot because of their numbers and media coverage, but Jayson especially deserves his fair share of the credit for how well he has come into his playing style this year. Any thoughts on this list? It would be greatly appreciated if you can do so. * * * My response: Great nickname, MWAT (we need a shorter nickname or at least an acronym). Excellent breakdown on who you have where and why. You didn\u2019t seem to struggle with the one thing that I do every week, which is trying to weigh the contributions of stars on the same team. You went with the same set of teammates in your top 10 that I have in my top 15. Some people would argue that it\u2019s too much. However, I tend to agree with you, particularly with the pair we are talking about (LeBron and AD, Kawhi and PG). You went with Tatum and I\u2019ve got Kemba Walker on my list. I don\u2019t see much to quibble with otherwise. Each of us is allowed to bring our own set of values to the process and you did that. From: Justin Gabriel  Wibisono Jan. 4, 2020 | 12:19 a.m. My name is Justin and I am a big fan of your articles here in Indonesia. I want to express my thanks to you for the amazing work you\u2019ve done with your interesting writings. First, I want to say that I am a Donovan Mitchell (and Utah Jazz) fan. That being said, I\u2019m so excited to see my man Donovan climb your ladder in the last few weeks. However, finishing outside the top 5, I think, won\u2019t show the full potential he has. What do you think Mitchell has to do to climb to that top five spot? * * * My response: Thanks for the email, Justin. And shout out to you and all the NBA fans in Indonesia. Donovan always seems to turn it on the second half of the regular season (same as the Jazz the past couple seasons), so it remains to be seen how he\u2019ll handle the next few critical weeks. He\u2019s certainly in that MVP mix and there is still a pretty big group of guys who can legitimately make that claim. We\u2019ll know more about who is legit as we get closer to All-Star weekend next month. From: Dylan Miller Jan. 1, 2020 | 3:31 p.m. I feel you can make a case for LeBron ahead of any of the top 5. For example: Anthony Davis: LeBron has been the best player and most valuable player on the Lakers. He passes, he scores, he rebounds, he plays defense, he leads in assists and is still averaging 25 points per game. I feel that\u2019s better than Davis averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and playing defense. James Harden: I feel all Harden does is score. He doesn\u2019t pass he, he doesn\u2019t get his teammates involved and he doesn\u2019t play defense. Last year, no one produced for him so he got away with not passing. But now, he has Westbrook. LeBron gets Davis, Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma and other guys involved while still scoring and playing defense. And, he is the best player on the No. 1 team in the West. Luka Doncic: LeBron is the focal point of a team with more than one star. He is the best player on the West\u2019s best team. Luka, who is the best player on his team, doesn\u2019t have another star to give him competition. Plus, the Mavs aren\u2019t as good as the Lakers. Luka and LeBron have similar stats, but these separate them in my opinion. Voters put Harden over LeBron for the MVP because Harden won more. Giannis Antetokounmpo: I feel like it is Giannis vs. LeBron this year for the MVP \u2026 it\u2019s very similar to LeBron vs. Harden in 2018. They\u2019re both putting up strong numbers and both teams are winning. I know Giannis is winning more, so this case is weaker and would lead to LeBron being No. 2. Here\u2019s my top 5: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Luka Doncic 4. James Harden 5. Anthony Davis Do the right thing this week and put LeBron at No. 2. * * * My response: I\u2019m going to take your advice, Dylan, and do my best to do the right thing on the next Kia Race to the MVP Ladder (Friday in this same space). That same case you claim can be made for LeBron over anyone in the top five is the same case I could make for each and every guy. We can bend the numbers and narrative all we want. The fact that the same five guys are mentioned most often is an indicator that the race is coming into focus as the season goes on. The more season we chew up, the easier it is to identify the strongest candidates. I still think we need another month or so to see who of this current group can keep up the pace. but we\u2019re close \u2026 so close. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Thunder, Nets set to square off Even after losing on the road to the Sixers last night , the Oklahoma City Thunder remain one of the hottest teams in the NBA. The same cannot be said for the Brooklyn Nets, who fell on the road in Orlando on Monday and now host the Thunder ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ). The Nets\u2019 starters have been slumping lately to say the least. Since Brooklyn\u2019s six-game losing streak began on Dec. 26, its starters are averaging 62.3 points per game ( which ranks 26th in the NBA ). 2. What happens next in Detroit? The Pistons have found themselves in the headlines lately, and not for winning games. There have been persistent trade rumors about Andre Drummond , as well as star forward Blake Griffin now out indefinitely and Detroit being blocked (literally) 20 times by the Lakers on Sunday night. The Pistons visit the Cavs ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and have to try to keep all these storylines out of mind. Despite all this off-court drama, the Pistons are just 4 1\/2 games back of the Orlando Magic for No. 8 in the East. 3. Knicks showing signs of life Under new coach Mike Miller, New York is 6-8 since the firing of David Fizdale in early December. While few are expecting the Knicks to make a serious run at the playoffs, they are improved of late. A game in L.A. against the West-leading Lakers ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) is one of many tests New York faces in the coming days ( in Utah on Jan. 8 , vs. Miami on Jan. 12 ). Keep an eye on Julius Randle for the Knicks, who has been pivotal in the team\u2019s success under Miller. Per our John Schuhmann, the Knicks are 7-4 (5-1 under Mike Miller) when Randle has scored more than 20 points . 4. Lakers\u2019 historic run in 1972 On Nov. 5, 1971, the Lakers beat the Baltimore Bullets 110-106. By Jan. 7, 1972, those winning ways continued to an NBA-record 33 straight games with a 134-90 drubbing of the Atlanta Hawks. The Lakers would lose their next game (a 120-104 decision to the Milwaukee Bucks), but were unstoppable once the playoffs got rolling. They reached The Finals and beat the New York Knicks in five games to secure the franchise\u2019s first title in Los Angeles.

No problem. Pop it back in, put me back in, coach. That was the long and short of the All-NBA big man\u2019s brief and visually jarring injury to his left hand on Monday night against Oklahoma City. Embiid, merely annoyed at the severely bent digit on his left hand, exited the floor with 1:26 left in the first quarter. It was promptly popped back into place \u2014 and Embiid simply returned to start the second quarter for the 76ers. \u201cIt was pretty bad,\u201d Embiid said after the game. \u201cI was basically playing with one hand.

The gruesome injury was something Embiid\u2019s teammates were both put off by and concerned about. \u201dI nearly threw up when I saw that,\u201d 76ers guard Ben Simmons said after Monday\u2019s 120-113 win . \u201dI\u2019m glad he came back out.

It looked pretty bad. I was relieved once I saw him come in so quickly and be able to go for the start of the second quarter.\u201d The injury prevented Embiid from playing with his usual force on the glass and he lost a bunch of rebounds to Steven Adams. \u201dI felt my finger snapping and I thought I fractured it,\u201d Embiid said. \u201dThey did some X-rays and said it was nothing.\u201d Embiid said there was a chance he might not play Thursday against Boston ( 7 ET, TNT ). \u201cYou know I want to play,\u201d he said . \u201cIt is a big game.

As his first return game there as a visitor looms this week, the Houston Rockets are doing what they can to ensure he\u2019ll play in his homecoming game. The Rockets visit the Thunder on Thursday ( 9:30 p.m. ET, TNT ), but before that they visit the Hawks on Wednesday ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). Westbrook has been held out of one game in back-to-back sets this season, but that strategy will be slightly altered this week. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni told reporters Monday that Westbrook will miss the game vs. Atlanta to ensure he\u2019ll play against Oklahoma City. Previously this season, the Rockets had held Westbrook out of the second game of back-to-backs (and Houston has gone 2-2 in those situations). \u201cRussell\u2019s out that game (vs. Atlanta), but will play the OKC game.\u201d D\u2019Antoni said . This season, Westbrook is averaging 24.1 points, 7.9 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game for Houston. The Rockets are 24-11, have won seven of their last nine games and are 4 1\/2 games behind the Los Angeles Lakers for the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. From 2008-19, Westbrook played for Oklahoma City, amassing 18,859 points, 5,760 rebounds, 6,897 assists and 1,442 steals. He ranks as the all-time leading scorer in Thunder history, while ranking third in rebounds, second in assists and third in steals. (The Thunder share their franchise history with the team\u2019s Seattle era.) Westbrook was the only remaining player from the Thunder\u2019s first season in Oklahoma City after the franchise moved from Seattle in 2008, earned All-NBA Third Team recognition in 2018-19 after logging his third consecutive season averaging a triple-double (this time: 22.9 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 10.7 apg). While with the Thunder, Westbrook was the Kia NBA MVP in 2016-17. He was also an eight-time All-Star, a two-time All-Star Game MVP, an eight-time All-NBA selection (First Team twice, Second Team five times, Third Team once), and won an Olympic gold medal with Team USA in 2012.

This marks the final regular-season installment between the teams and could be viewed as a preview for a potential postseason series between them. Doncic set Dallas\u2019 franchise-record for triple-doubles in a season with his 10th during a loss Saturday to the Hornets. The Mavs came into this week on a six-game home stand but had lost three of their last four. The Lakers entered Sunday\u2019s games with the best record in the West, riding a four-game winning streak, with James having racked up six consecutive points and assists double-doubles, averaging 21 points, 9.2 rebounds and 12.8 assists over that span. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 12, 2019 Best friends, Porter and Young captured a Peach Jam title together in 2016 as headliners of the Mokan Elite AAU squad, and now get a chance to go head-to-head on the game\u2019s biggest stage. They\u2019ve matched up previously in the NBA, but Porter played sparingly and scored just two points on Nov. 12 in a loss to the Hawks. Porter racked up a career-high 25 points in 22 minutes on Jan. 2 and followed that up with just seven Saturday in a loss at Washington (he played just 12 minutes). Young, meanwhile, put up his fifth 40-point outing of the season on Saturday, giving him the second-most 40-point performances of the season behind James Harden (14) . Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Oct. 28, 2019  The past meets the future when Westbrook makes his first trip back to Oklahoma City \u2014 where he spent 11 seasons as the face of the franchise and earned eight trips to the NBA All-Star Game \u2014 to take on Gilgeous-Alexander and the revamped Thunder. OKC finished the week capturing its fifth straight win, and it has won nine of its last 10. The Rockets are 15-2 this season when Westbrook shoots 42% or better and 7-7 when he shoots below 42%. The Thunder finished the week with a win against the Cavaliers, giving them a 13-4 record since Dec. 1 . That mark is tied for second-best in the NBA during that span. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Dec. 27, 2019  Potential first-time All-Stars go head to head in what should be a fun battle between a couple of this season\u2019s most productive bigs. Sabonis finished off last week racking up his 28th double-double of the season, which ranks third in the NBA . But the Pacers had dropped four of five to close out last week. Miami, meanwhile, came into the week having lost two of its last three after winning five in a row from Dec. 18-28 . Adebayo has logged double-digit rebounds in three of his last four games . Adebayo\u2019s Heat came out on top the last time these players met, but Sabonis had won the three prior matchups going back to November of 2018. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Dec. 21, 2019  Young players on the rise face off for just the second time this season, but Graham has logged only one start in the matchup against Mitchell. In that game, he scored 22 points to go with four assists in a December loss to the Jazz. Mitchell lit up Orlando for 32 points and six assists in Utah\u2019s fifth consecutive win to close out last week. Graham finished last week with 27 points and 13 assists in a win over Dallas to give Charlotte its second consecutive win after dropping a season-high six in a row in December. The Hornets are 5-9 this season against Western Conference opponents. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: March 1, 2019  It\u2019s always a fun night when a pair of All-Star guards meet, as we\u2019ve got here with Lillard vs. Lowry. Lillard entered the week having scored 30 or more in five of his last six games. The banged-up Raptors notched a dominant win against Brooklyn last Saturday to improve to 5-4 over their previous nine games. Toronto is 6-4 since Dec. 18, which is when it lost Marc Gasol (hamstring), Pascal Siakam (groin) and Norman Powell (shoulder) to injury.

There\u2019s no sense of urgency to upgrade rosters, or disgruntled players rattling the cage, or bloated player contracts that have yet to run their course, or \u201cmissing pieces\u201d needing to be found. Basically, no need for a trade deadline . (For the record, there still is one and it\u2019s Feb. 6 at 3 p.m. ET.) Of course, that\u2019s not how it works \u2014 in this or any other NBA season. Part of the challenge (and even the fun) of navigating through the 82-game grind is reaching a stage where a team can improve itself, for the short or long term, through deal-making. The first half of the season dictates this: Is your team progressing as planned? Or is it hopelessly stalled? Is a player on your roster worth more to you on another team? Maybe your team suddenly finds itself in the thick of the playoff chase and only needs a little extra help to solidify its place. That means it\u2019s time to buy at the deadline. Or perhaps, the flip side: Your team is faltering and it\u2019s time to bail and sell, sell, sell. Some trade deadlines are busier than others, and there\u2019s really no way to project or predict the amount of activity in the days leading up to when the bullhorn sounds. It just \u2026 happens. Which brings us to February 2020. What makes this deadline a bit different than those in the recent past is free agency timing. This summer, there will be fewer \u201cA-list\u201d players on the market, especially compared to last summer, when the earth shook . Under normal circumstances, teams would rather wait until summer to improve themselves instead of using the trade deadline. Therefore, with that significant pipeline all but closed this July, this trade deadline looms larger. But that doesn\u2019t mean there will be a hike in activity. If fewer players are being shopped, fewer deals will be made. It\u2019s that simple. Here\u2019s a look at the most likely buyers and sellers \u2014 11 teams total \u2014 along with the players who might want the moving companies on speed dial. * * * If the deadline passes and the Cavaliers remain untouched, something went seriously wrong. No team is begging to be parceled off more than the Cavs, who lead the league in salty veterans asking (privately, of course) to be traded. First-year coach John Beilein has been under siege, dealing with a deadly combination of losing and players who don\u2019t see a future on a team committed to rebuilding. And so, who\u2019s going to be tossed overboard: Kevin Love or Tristan Thompson? Or both? The Cavs got a jump on the process by shipping Jordan Clarkson to Utah last month, but Love and Thompson are better players and therefore will be a bit more challenging to move. It\u2019s really about how much the Cavs are demanding \u2014 or how little they\u2019ll settle for \u2014 in return. Love is owed roughly $91 million the next three years. That\u2019s a tough contract to swallow and demonstrates how weird it was for the Cavs to give him a four-year, $120 million deal after losing LeBron James 18 months ago. Either the Cavs must take back a slightly less-poisonous contract in a trade or essentially give Love away in a package for expiring contracts just to escape the contract. It\u2019s not an ideal situation. Love\u2019s hometown of Portland could be in the running, maybe for Hassan Whiteside\u2019s expiring contract. Thompson is having a solid season (12.4 points, 10.3 rebounds) and his contract is expiring. Still, how many teams will give Cleveland anything of value for a three-month rental?  As a surprise contender in the West and with Luka Doncic in the Kia MVP running , the Mavs could \u2014 and maybe should \u2014 turn into buyers and make an honest run at it. Anything can happen in the playoffs, if you\u2019re prepared to take advantage. While everyone seems ready to crown a Los Angeles team in the West, the Mavericks would be well-positioned to become a spoiler if they add another piece and the Lakers or Clippers stumble. Might the Mavericks sacrifice a protected first-rounder in a package that brings a rim protector next to Kristaps Porzingis, or a third scorer? Are they willing to gamble on Love or Thompson? It takes some rather bold thinking to roll the dice and add a piece mid-season. We\u2019ll learn soon if the Mavericks are waiting for next season, or ready to seize today.  They find themselves in a dicey situation with the pending return of Zion Williamson . Now within striking distance of the final playoff spot, the 2019 No. 1 overall pick could be the factor to push the Pelicans upward and onward in the second half. Or, because they\u2019ll most likely limit his minutes and play the load management card, maybe Williamson won\u2019t make much of a difference. In that case, the Pelicans could shop JJ Redick and\/or Jrue Holiday for future help and salary cap relief this summer. Both Redick and Holiday would be in demand with title contenders, especially Redick, given his team-friendly contract and 42% shooting from deep.  From the time they traded for Andre Iguodala and then told him not to bother showing up, the Grizzlies held a curious trade chip. That\u2019s still the case, although you wonder how much market depreciation, if any, was suffered by Iguodala in the process. There exist two schools of thought: 1. By not playing this season, Iguodala preserved his body and therefore will be fresh for a postseason run with whomever he plays. 2. By not playing this season, he\u2019ll be rusty and at best serving in spot duty as a back-end rotation guy on a good team. Last we saw him, Iguodala was fairly solid for the Warriors during The Finals . He\u2019s a championship-tested veteran who knows his way around the floor in the postseason. He\u2019s all but guaranteed to be moved. Question is, for what? And where? A return to Denver might be possible. Andre Drummond is somewhat prehistoric in today\u2019s game. He\u2019s a decent low-post big man in an era during which that species is all but extinct. Can he help someone, or merely get in the way? Also, where has he ever taken the Pistons? Drummond remains the game\u2019s best rebounder (NBA-best 15.9 rpg this season) and that counts for something even if the center position is being devalued in all but a few special cases. He has a $28 million player option for next season, which also makes it tricky for the Pistons, because there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll be anything more than a rental for someone. Truth be told, the Pistons would rather deal Blake Griffin. He\u2019s owed $74 million over the next two seasons, but his knees are betraying him and nobody\u2019s taking that contract without sending something equally horrific back to Detroit.  Julius Randle is averaging 18.7 points and 9.1 rebounds per game and his contract isn\u2019t too lethal ($37 million the next two seasons), which makes him the best trade chip for the Knicks. Here\u2019s another option: Should the Knicks consider cutting their losses with Kevin Knox? Yes, he\u2019s only 20 and was the No. 9 pick in the 2018 draft . But he hasn\u2019t improved much and, if anything, his confidence and role are suffering. He\u2019s still on his rookie contract and another team with a solid development program could make the Knicks a reasonable offer. Is it too soon to bail on a young-but-stalled talent? The Knicks have nothing to lose here either way.  Once the season began, the Hornets went all-in on their youth movement and their high-priced and low-producing veterans began collecting dust. Therefore, the phone lines are open in Charlotte. Problem is, there\u2019s not much of a market for someone such as Nicolas Batum and the $27.1 million he\u2019ll make next season. But Michael-Kidd Gilchrist and Marvin Williams are on expiring deals and could generate buzz. Williams is a low-maintenance vet who\u2019s great in the locker room, is a career 36.3% 3-point shooter and may be a good fit in certain rotations. Additionally, big man Cody Zeller is one of the few remaining vets who hasn\u2019t been tossed aside. In the right situation, Zeller \u2014 who has one year at $15 million left on his deal \u2014 could be a rotational front-line player on a contender.  They made not one, but two head-scratching additions last summer : Trevor Ariza and Dewayne Dedmon. To almost no one\u2019s surprise, neither is seeing significant minutes and Dedmon has already expressed public frustration . It makes you wonder what the Kings were thinking five months ago. Dedmon will be tough to move, in terms of getting anything of value, because he\u2019s an offensively challenged big man who\u2019s not a deluxe rebounder and is owed roughly $26 million the next two seasons. Ariza has one year left at $12.8 million (which is not fully guaranteed), and long valued for his defense and 3-point shooting. But how much is left in the tank of the 16-year veteran?  Let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: Chris Paul is all but guaranteed to stay in OKC at least another season. His contract is a deal-breaker (and a back-breaker for anyone trying to lift it) as he\u2019ll get $85.5 million over the next two seasons. Contending teams are usually strapped for cash and unwilling to part with a major piece to surrender in a trade for Paul unless that piece is a flawed asset. His final season is a player option, but raise your hand if you believe Paul will pass on taking $44 million at age 36. In a more realistic scenario, Paul will play out his deal in OKC and then go ring-chasing, maybe in L.A. with LeBron James. Meanwhile, the Thunder can dangle Danilo Gallinari, a still-functional shooter who\u2019s on an expiring deal. Or they could see what Steven Adams will bring. Or they can stay put as they\u2019re in the West playoff chase these days. They could enjoy their unexpectedly good run with Paul in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year here without Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Miami can actually qualify as both buyers and sellers by seeing what they can get for Dion Waiters and Justise Winslow, two players whose futures in Miami are questionable. Waiters hasn\u2019t been a factor since signing a contract extension three summers ago and lately has caused major headaches for the franchise with his questionable behavior. He\u2019s been suspended three times , and in any event, his position and role are being gobbled up by hungry young players. Of course, because of the baggage, the market for Waiters is cool. Plus, he\u2019s owed $12.6 million next season. Winslow remains a functional player, yet the swing position is populated by Jimmy Butler, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Derrick Jones Jr., all of whom weigh heavier in the Heat\u2019s resurgence . There also might be interest in Goran Dragic, who\u2019s on an expiring contract, if the Heat want to go that route.  All indications are the Golden State Warriors will wait until summer to decide on D\u2019Angelo Russell\u2019s fate rather than deal him at the deadline, unless someone blows them away. By waiting, they can judge that trade market and will also know where they\u2019ll select in the Draft lottery . * * * Shaun Powell  has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Thunder, Sixers head in opposite directions Barely a week into 2020 and the Thunder have won five in a row and are 4 1\/2 games back of the No. 4-seeded LA Clippers. On the flip side, the Sixers are 1 1\/2 games out of No. 4 in the East, falling into that spot because of their four-game skid. The teams meet tonight in Philly ( 7 ET, NBA TV ) and, as usual, the (recent) numbers don\u2019t lie about either team. Since Christmas Day, the Sixers are 19th in Defensive Rating and are struggling to make shots from just about everywhere. During that same span, the Thunder rank seventh in Defensive Rating and have been outstanding in clutch situations , piling up a 4-0 mark and 126.8 Offensive Rating. 2. Nets trying to end skid Brooklyn got some tough news over the weekend as guard Kyrie Irving may need surgery on his troublesome right shoulder. Add to that a blowout home loss to the Raptors on Saturday and the Nets are in the midst of a five-game skid as they travel to Orlando ( 7 ET, League Pass ). While Caris LeVert did play in Saturday\u2019s game, he\u2019s been ruled out vs. the Magic . As for Orlando, it is doing a little better of late (4-2 in its last six games) and is getting good play from Khem Birch and Terrence Ross of late. 3. Pelicans could test warming Jazz In each of the past five seasons, Utah has won six games in a row at least one time. The Jazz are on the cusp of that again as they visit the Pelicans ( 8 ET, League Pass ), who have improved of late themselves. New Orleans is 6-2 over its last eight games, ranking No. 4 in Defensive Rating since then while also finishing in the top 5 in Net Rating and Rebound Percentage as well. The Jazz may luck out tonight, though, as star guard Jrue Holiday (left elbow contustion) is questionable for the game . He\u2019s averaging 20 points, 4.3 rebounds and 5.6 assists over his last eight games. 4. Bucks falling in love with 3-pointers To date, Milwaukee ranks third in the NBA in 3-pointers made (518) and attempted (1,440), 13th in 3-point percentage (36%) and third in 3-point frequency (42.8%). It\u2019s clear the Bucks aren\u2019t about to stop shooting from deep as they face the Spurs ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) in search of their sixth straight win. San Antonio isn\u2019t the best at limiting opponents 3-pointers ( they rank 20th in 3-pointers allowed per game) and allowed the Bucks to hoist 45 of them in Saturday\u2019s loss in Milwaukee . 5. Kings are fading fast Back on Dec. 15, the Kings dropped the Warriors and moved to 12-14 as they held the No. 7 spot in the West. Life hasn\u2019t been the same since then and as the teams meet tonight ( 10 ET, NBA TV ), the hopes Sacramento had of a playoff run are just about squelched. Since Dec. 15, the Kings have lost nine of 10 games, are struggling on offense and defense despite only losing one of those games (a 105-87 loss to the LA Clippers on Dec. 31 ) by more than 15 points. 6. Has it really been 25 years? Back on Jan. 6, 1995, then-Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens passed Red Auerbach on the all-time wins list, collecting career win No. 939. Since then, nine other coaches \u2014 Bill Fitch, Rick Adelman, Larry Brown, Phil Jackson, George Karl, Pat Riley, Jerry Sloan, Gregg Popovich and Don Nelson \u2014 have surpassed Auerbach\u2019s mark. But Wilkens was the first to do so and we pay a bit of homage to that in this space."},{"id":29626,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/paul-george-patrick-beverley-active-kawhi-leonard-out","date":"2020-01-05","title":"Paul George, Patrick Beverley active against Knicks; Kawhi Leonard out","content":" LA Clippers forward Paul George and guard Patrick Beverley will return to the floor against the New York Knicks on Sunday ( 3:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), the team announced before the game.

Michael Jordan was the reigning league MVP when Carter, another 6-foot-6 guard out of North Carolina, was taken fifth in the 1998 Draft . Tim Duncan had just won the Rookie of the Year award while leading the Spurs to the first of 22 consecutive playoff appearances (and counting). Shaq and Kobe were still two years away from their first championship. LeBron James was about to enter eighth grade. Luka Doncic was not yet born. Carter has worn an NBA jersey through \u2014 and beyond \u2014 all those events while becoming one of, if not the , best dunkers in NBA history. Eight All-Star appearances, two All-NBA honors, an Olympic gold medal and countless posters highlight his resum\u00e9. Known as \u201cAir Canada\u201d, \u201cHalf-Man\/Half-Amazing\u201d or \u201cVinsanity\u201d in Toronto and New Jersey, Carter began taking on a reserve and leadership role later in his career. Now, with more than 25,000 points to his name ( 20th all-time ), Carter is making his final NBA lap.

Shams Charania and Joe Vardon of The Athletic write that Love expressed \u201chis displeasure and disgust with the organization,\u201d and that his outburst was directed toward general manager Koby Altman. The Athletic report adds that Love had been fined or threatened with fines for similar infractions, most recently during the Cavs\u2019 117-97 loss at Toronto on Dec. 31. A clip of Love angrily demanding the ball from second-year guard Collin Sexton made the social media rounds during Saturday\u2019s 121-106 loss to Oklahoma City.

Irving said Saturday he chose to get a cortisone shot late last month instead of having arthroscopic surgery, with the goal of playing for the first time since the middle of November. He said his shoulder problem began with overuse near the end of training camp and got worse early in the regular season. He finally stopped playing after a Nov. 14 game in Denver and the Nets have said his injury is an impingement. Irving said he also had bursitis in the shoulder. He said surgery would knock him out for at least a couple months, but he would prefer first to keep working toward playing this season, his first in Brooklyn. \u201cI want to go out and play,\u201d Irving said, \u201cso just continue to rehab and live the results of me going out there and giving it an actual shot, going out there, being with the guys, seeing where we can land and then move forward after the season.\u201d He signed with Brooklyn in July but was hurt even before training camp when he was hit in the face while scrimmaging with teammates. He was hit again when he returned for an exhibition game in China, forcing him back to the sidelines. Irving said he then tried to make up for lost time by doing extra shooting, even after games. \u201cIt got to the point where I had overused it,\u201d Irving said. The All-Star point guard kept playing as the Nets struggled at the beginning of the season, even as he said the pain worsened after a home game against New Orleans on Nov. 4. The Nets then went on a five-game road trip, where Irving continued to play until the pain got so bad he was having trouble lifting his shoulder. \u201cIt really is disheartening when you\u2019re working your tail off to be a certain level and then your shooting shoulder just starts to give out on you a little bit,\u201d Irving said. The Nets have given no timetable for his return, saying only that he had been able to do work on the court but nothing where he would absorb contact. Irving acknowledged the mental struggles he faced in Boston last season after the death of his grandfather. He said being injured will always be a mental strain, but he said he is in a better place after getting the shot. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life working to do at a very high level and I want to do it at the best level I can, which is greatness,\u201d Irving said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re injured and especially when your team needs you, yeah, of course you go home and you\u2019re like, \u2018Why am I not playing yet?

Never mind that the Bulls tied a 54-year-old franchise record by shooting exactly zero free throws in the first half. Or that they\u2019d given up more than twice as many points off turnovers prior to halftime. Or were shooting just 35% from 2-point range to that point. Chicago\u2019s shooters had attempted 24 shots from the arc, had hit 10 of them (41.7%) and were bothering the Bucks into 1-of-14 troubles from out there. No wonder the Bulls had erased an early 13-point deficit to trail by a mere three halfway through. \u201cThey hit a ton of 3s in that second quarter,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said, \u201cand sometimes that\u2019s hard to sustain for a game.\u201d Sure enough, the Bulls did \u201ccome back to\u201d the Bucks a little in the second half \u2013 they hit 7 of 20 \u2013 and Milwaukee\u2019s defense got a bit more successful. It helped, too, that the Bucks got even hotter (10 of 18) on 3-pointers than their hosts had been at United Center Monday. That made the outcome, a 123-102 Milwaukee victory, look like so many others in what has been the Bucks\u2019 march to the NBA\u2019s best record (now 31-5 ). But the before-and-after snapshots of that game pulled back the curtain on a Milwaukee weakness, a vulnerability that has shown itself in the Bucks\u2019 past nine defeats \u2013 dating back to the Eastern Conference finals against Toronto \u2013 and even in their two most recent victories. It\u2019s been cited or alluded to before, but it stands out more dramatically lately in contrast to all the wonderfulness emanating from Giannis Antetokounmpo and his crew this season. It goes like this: The Bucks\u2019 system is predicated on outshooting their opponents from 3-point range. Offensively, that spreads defenses and gives Antetokounmpo room to roam or romp to the rim. Symbiotically, the more havoc he is wreaking inside, the better looks his teammates get when launching from outside. Defensively, Milwaukee all but dares opposing shooters to do to them what they do to others. Contesting 3-point attempts is low on the priority list, and Bucks big men, like Brook and Robin Lopez, sink into the paint rather than let themselves get drawn far from the basket. And it mostly works, or has over the past season-and-not-quite-half, evident in their 91-27 record since Budenholzer installed his philosophy to start the 2018-19 season. The Bucks are satisfied to play the percentages and live with the results.  Even when things turn against them. Consider: 1. After being the only team to win 60 games last season and breezing along at 8-1 through the first two playoff rounds, life abruptly got harder for the Bucks in the East finals. The Raptors beat them at their own game six times in six tries, outscoring (258-213) and outshooting (.374-.310) Milwaukee on 3-pointers in the series. Over the final four games \u2013 all Bucks\u2019 losses, wiping out their 2-0 lead \u2013 Toronto went 61-of-156 (.391) from the arc to Milwaukee\u2019s 47-of-140 (.336). 2. The Bucks have been outshot on 3s in each of their five defeats this season. The disparity in those games? The Heat, Celtics, Jazz, Mavericks and Sixers were a combined 85-of-206 (.413) vs. Milwaukee\u2019s 65-of-209 (.311). 3. The stats have been flipped in Milwaukee\u2019s 31 victories. Opponents have shot 426-of-1,188 (.359) compared to the Bucks\u2019 436-1,186 (.368). 4. Similar to the game in Chicago, the Bucks ran into 3-point trouble at home against Minnesota Wednesday. They hit only nine of their 36 attempts (.250) to start the New Year, while the Timberwolves went 15-of-46 from deep. What happened? A Wolves squad missing both Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins hung surprisingly close on the road in a 106-104 loss. And now the Bucks are about to face San Antonio in a home-and-away pair of games Saturday and Monday. Though not known for their commitment to the 3-ball, the Spurs have gone 45-of-97 (.464) from out there in their past three games compared to 283-of-794 (.356) in their first 30. Even mid-range master LaMarcus Aldridge has been out of character, going 14-of-20 in his last five. You might think that adjustments would be in order. If not in the game plan Milwaukee takes into each of its contests, then at least coming out of the locker room at halftime when the stats tilt the wrong way. You would think wrong. The Bucks are the Bucks. It\u2019s how they play, it\u2019s how they win and it\u2019s what they do. \u201cWe say that fairly often: \u2018The worm is going to turn,\u2019\u201d Budenholzer said in Chicago. \u201cIf we\u2019re the team that hasn\u2019t made any, probably it\u2019s gonna change and we\u2019re gonna make some. If the other team has been super-hot, hopefully, some nights or most nights they cool off.\u201d No decisions as a group to shift the offense, the coach said, and few discernible temptations in individuals to shy away from what isn\u2019t working on a particular night. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna keep shooting,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna keep letting it fly. We do want to attack the paint and drive, but we should be doing that [anyway]. We should be shooting 3s whether we\u2019re 1-for-14 or 10-for-14. Our guys don\u2019t tend to change.\u201d Basketball coaches forever have preached that, if your jump shot isn\u2019t falling, pound the ball inside for a layup or a trip to the foul line. But not this coach for these players. Said wing Khris Middleton: \u201cIf we\u2019re forcing up shots \u2013 jump shots, bad 3s \u2013 then we have to force the issue more and get into the paint. But a lot of our looks we missed in the first half [at Chicago], they were great looks, wide open shots that we\u2019ve just got to knock down.\u201d \u201cNo, just trust the process,\u201d guard George Hill said. \u201cTeams get hot, but they know our defense is pretty good. We want to give up jump shots \u2013 we don\u2019t want guys in our paint.\u201d The trade-off might make acceptable what seems a little stubborn. Milwaukee ranks dead last in 3-point shots and 3-pointers allowed . But no defense allows fewer 2-pointers, on average, or at a lower percentage (.441). The Bucks also rank in the top five in fewest free throws bestowed, which means they\u2019re excellent at defending without fouling. \u201cIf there\u2019s an individual who gets hot, we may adjust to him, we may change up our coverage,\u201d Brook Lopez said. \u201cBut we try to be who we are at the defensive end. Our identity is who we are. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so good and able to repeat our success.\u201d So the Bucks keep playing the percentages, the most important of which for now is that .861 next to their 31-5 record. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

With the start of 2020, we are getting close to the midway point of the season. And with 42% of games complete through Thursday, here are some things of note as we head into the Week 11 weekend. Given their injuries and the departure of Kevin Durant, it\u2019s not a surprise that the Golden State Warriors have seen the league\u2019s biggest drop from last season (by a wide margin) in point differential per 100 possessions. What may be a surprise is the team that has seen the second biggest drop. After a 5-12 start, the Portland Trail Blazers had seemingly fixed themselves with a four-week, 9-4 stretch . But only one of those nine wins (Nov. 27 vs. Oklahoma City) came against a team that\u2019s currently over .500. And now the Blazers have lost five straight, with three of the losses coming to teams currently below .500. The Blazers rank 22nd defensively and, though it began with an ugly, 102-94 loss to New Orleans and though three of the five opponents have below-average offenses, the losing streak has been their worst five-game stretch of defense ( 119.4 points allowed per 100 possessions ) this season. Portland has to hope that the nadir was their loss in New York on Wednesday, in which they allowed the Knicks\u2019 27th-ranked offense (which has been playing better of late) to score 117 points on 100 possessions. It\u2019s not good when you give up four dunks on the Frank Ntilikina-Mitchell Robinson pick-and-roll\u2026 After the Knicks got the last two of those on their final two possessions of the third quarter on Wednesday, the Blazers blitzed the Ntilikina-Robinson pick-and-roll (with Anthony Tolliver, more mobile and less of a rim protector than Hassan Whiteside) on the first possession of the fourth. Robinson caught Ntilikina\u2019s pass at the elbow and, when met with weak-side help, kicked the ball out to an open Reggie Bullock . He then got rebounding position on the recovering Tolliver and tipped in Bullock\u2019s miss, on his way to a perfect, 11-for-11 night from the field. The Blazers have generally protected the rim decently. They rank fifth in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (58.5%). But while they rank 12th in opponent effective field goal percentage, they\u2019re in the bottom 10 in each of the other four factors on defense: 24th in opponent free throw rate (28.3 attempts per 100 shots from the field), 28th in opponent turnover rate (12.7 per 100 possessions), and 26th in defensive rebounding percentage (having allowed their opponents to grab 29.2% of available offensive boards). \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just one thing,\u201d CJ McCollum said Wednesday about the issues that have popped up over this five-game slide, before listing problems on just one end of the floor (even though his team just shot 39% against the Knicks). \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s transition. Sometimes, there\u2019s offensive rebounds. Sometimes, we\u2019re fouling. It\u2019s like there\u2019s something new every game.\u201d The Blazers\u2019 schedule is only going to get tougher. Their five-game trip continues in Washington on Friday ( 7 ET, League Pass ). But then they visit Miami (where the Heat are 16-1) on Sunday and Toronto on Tuesday. In total, they have the league\u2019s second toughest January schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage, with 10 of their 14 remaining games against teams currently over .500. After that loss in New York on Wednesday, the Blazers are 11-9 against teams currently under .500 and 3-12 against teams currently over .500. The Blazers\u2019 injuries \u2014 they\u2019re currently without Jusuf Nurkic, Zach Collins, Skal Labissiere and Rodney Hood (done for the season) \u2014 have certainly been a factor. But their issues go beyond that, and the tough schedule wouldn\u2019t be so daunting if they could figure out how to fix them. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Damian Lillard said. \u201cYou think, when you start slow, all right, it\u2019s just the beginning. It\u2019s going to take some time, and then you play better, and it don\u2019t work out. And you have another rough stretch and it\u2019s, like, ongoing. \u201cSo that part is the most frustrating, but I think we got to be prepared for even if it\u2019s this way, up and down the whole season. We got to make sure that we\u2019re in it to continue to fight, because even though it\u2019s like this, we\u2019re in the playoff race. That\u2019s the reason for us to keep on fighting.\u201d That\u2019s the thing. At 14-21, the Blazers are just a game out of a playoff spot and tied in the win column with the eighth-place Spurs, who have an even tougher January schedule.  The team that had the No. 1 defense last season has seen the league\u2019s sixth biggest drop in points allowed per 100 possessions. Having allowed just 101.2 per 100 through 36 games, the Milwaukee Bucks are comfortably in position to lead the league in defensive efficiency for a second straight year. One thing the Bucks didn\u2019t do last season is also lead the league in pace. Through Thursday, the Bucks have averaged a league-high 104.8 possessions per 48 minutes . It\u2019s somewhat counterintuitive to play great defense while playing fast. Over the last 23 years (since play-by-play data started being tracked in 1996), 30 teams have finished a season in the top five in both pace and offensive efficiency, but only 10 have done it in the top five in both pace and defensive efficiency. Only one, the 2014-15 Warriors, has led the league in both. Pace isn\u2019t just about how fast a team plays offensively, because for every offensive possession, there\u2019s a defensive possession. And you don\u2019t necessarily want the pace you play at offensively to be reflected on the other end of the floor. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the league has an effective field goal percentage of 59.0% in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 52.6% in the middle 12 seconds of the shot clock, and just 43.7% in the last six seconds of the shot clock. The Bucks have taken 19.2% of their shots, the league\u2019s highest rate, in the first six seconds of the shot clock. And according to Synergy tracking, 20.8% percent of their possessions, also the league\u2019s highest rate , have been in transition. They\u2019ve taken just 10.1% of their shots, the league\u2019s lowest rate, in the last six seconds of the clock. On the other end of the floor, their opponents have taken only 13.0% of their shots in the first six seconds, a rate well below the league average (14.7%). Only 14.6% of their opponents\u2019 possessions, the league\u2019s ninth lowest opponent rate , have been in transition. Milwaukee opponents have taken 13.7% of their shots in the last six seconds of the clock. The Bucks play fast, while managing to keep their opponents from doing the same. That\u2019s not an easy needle to thread, and it\u2019s a big reason why they\u2019re 31-5. Another reason is that they\u2019ve played one of the league\u2019s easiest schedules. But they\u2019ve taken care of business, going 22-0 against the 17 teams currently under .500 . They\u2019re playing 11 of their 13 January games against that group, and their next two are a home-and-home set with the Spurs, Saturday in Milwaukee ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) and Monday in San Antonio ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ).  The Bucks aren\u2019t the only team who has taken care of business. The 13 teams currently over .500 are 215-44 against the 17 teams currently below .500, with the Lakers (18-0) and Raptors (18-0) also undefeated against the bottom 17. The Lakers play their next three games against the bottom 17, but they host the Pelicans on Friday (10:30 ET, ESPN), and New Orleans comes to L.A. with a four-game winning streak . The Raptors play their next four against teams with losing records, but the shorthanded champs are in Brooklyn on Saturday, with the Nets just having fell below .500 and reportedly set to get Caris LeVert back from a 24-game absence. A couple of weeks ago, the Raptors came back from 30 points down in the third quarter to beat the Mavs. It was the first time in 10 years that a team won a regular season game it trailed by at least 30 points. The Clippers also came back from 31 down to beat the Warriors in Game 2 of their first-round series last year. Two 30-point comebacks in 10 years is not quite a trend. But there\u2019s a prevailing thought that a double-digit lead ain\u2019t what it used to be, because of the increase in 3-point shooting and the volatility that comes with it. This is the ninth straight season in which the league has seen increase in the percentage of its shots that have come from 3-point range. That number is 38%, up from 36% last season and 22% in 2010-11. And indeed, a double-digit lead isn\u2019t as safe as it was nine years ago. This season, teams have won 75.0% of the games they\u2019ve led by 10 points or more. That\u2019s the lowest mark of the last 10 seasons, down from 78.4% in \u201910-11. Just on Thursday, six different teams \u2014 Brooklyn, Chicago, Cleveland, Indiana, Memphis and San Antonio \u2014 lost games that they led by double-digits. But Thursday was a rare night, and the drop in overall winning percentage after leading by double-digits is not a huge dip. There hasn\u2019t been a drop with every season, as has been the case with the 3-point-rate increase. These numbers don\u2019t account for a team losing a 10, 15 or 20-point lead and still winning the game. They\u2019re solely about the final result. And one game (in which both teams held leads of 10, 15 or 20) could be accounted for twice in the numbers above. Still, a double-digit lead remains meaningful. This season, every team but one \u2014 the 6-7 Atlanta Hawks \u2014 has a winning record after holding a double-digit lead.  There\u2019s been a lot of talk about post-ups recently. After the Inside the NBA crew said that Kristaps Porzingis should post up more, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle answered by saying that \u201cthe post-up isn\u2019t a good play anymore.\u201d According to Synergy play-type tracking, Joel Embiid (1.14) and Andre Drummond (1.01) are the only players who have averaged a point per possession on at least three post-ups per game . Porzingis, meanwhile, has scored just 0.57 points per possession on post-ups, the worst mark (by a healthy margin) among 30 players who have averaged at least two post-up possessions per game , according to Synergy. The post-up isn\u2019t entirely dead, however. And while guys like Embiid and LaMarcus Aldridge post-up to score, others use the post-up to make plays. According to Second Spectrum tracking (which includes post-ups that don\u2019t end with a shot, free throw or turnover), 29 players have posted up at least three times per game. Three of those 29 have passed more than 50% of of the time \u2026 On the other end of the list , three players have passed less than 20% of the time they\u2019ve posted up\u2026 It\u2019s an interesting list in regard to both ends of it. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The players showed up and spent the night puffing cigars, eating well and laughing loud. By all accounts, the private black-tie affair was on the celebratory level of any post-Oscar bash. LeBron did playfully grouse how he \u201chad to pay for my own party\u201d but whatever cash he burned through was a small price for unforgettable fun and camaraderie. And yet, those very same players have benefitted far greater from LeBron\u2019s generosity in another way, specifically by how he treats them on game nights, from tip to buzzer. To put it simply: if they\u2019re open, the ball is finding them. The player who spent dollars for his party also drops dimes for his teammates. The assists this season are rising right along with his case for being the most complete player in NBA history . LeBron is pushing the limits of his ability to distribute the ball, which was remarkable even before 2019-20. His Laker mates are keeping their heads swiveling, realizing that a timely bounce pass or lob will come their way if they work hard enough to spring free. LeBron is leading the NBA in assists at 10.9 per game, the highest mark of his career (previous high: 9.1 in 2017-18 ), and is the only player averaging in double-figures so far this season. It\u2019s extremely rare for a scorer. In most cases, players who routinely get 25 or so points don\u2019t throw the ball \u2014 they ask for it. LeBron\u2019s style of play, however, is far from routine. His unselfish manner isn\u2019t anything new; LeBron has always been a willing passer \u2014 even while playing mainly power forward \u2014 and the career numbers reflect that. He\u2019s ninth all-time in assists (9,021) and will almost certainly pass Isiah Thomas (9,061) at No. 8 this season. The other seven ahead of LeBron (in order) are John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Mark Jackson, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson and the still-active Chris Paul. Perhaps next season he\u2019ll crack 10,000, especially if he remains in his current role and stays healthy. Since opening night, LeBron has been the Lakers\u2019 point guard. This comes somewhat as a surprise because the Lakers initially wanted to ease LeBron\u2019s multitasking, especially coming off a season where he suffered his first significant injury and missed 22 games. They also happen to have Rajon Rondo. Coach Frank Vogel, in his first interview after taking the job last summer, was initially cool on the idea of LeBron being the point man. But after consulting with LeBron and the coaching staff, he decided the Lakers were best with the ball in LeBron\u2019s hands as often as possible, especially after Rondo was injured to start the season. There\u2019s a hunch among some Lakers folks that LeBron will not only finish as the assists leader this season, but that he desperately wants the title. It would set him apart from other greats in that sense and give him a unique place in history. The only other unconventional assists leader was Wilt Chamberlain in 1967-68 . Wilt wanted to shatter the perception of him being a selfish scorer. (While Wilt did compile more assists than anyone that season, he did not have the highest per-game average. Back then, the league back then recognized total assists instead of average, something that changed three seasons later.) The only drawback is LeBron\u2019s hike in turnovers \u2014 his 3.8 per game ranks sixth in the NBA . The Lakers will live with that because, more often than not, something positive happens when the play starts with LeBron. Not only are LeBron\u2019s passes hitting the intended target, they\u2019re entertaining as well. His signature passes are the cross-court bullets to teammates standing behind the 3-point stripe in the corners, reaching them in time for open jumpers. It\u2019s also not unusual to see LeBron take risks, for the sake of flair, by throwing bounce passes in traffic to a teammate cutting toward the rim. Yet the most effective pass usually ends up in the hands of Anthony Davis, and it\u2019s not a coincidence that LeBron\u2019s assists are up in his first season with Davis. Per NBA Advanced Stats, Davis has been the recipient of 25.4% of LeBron\u2019s assists (102), more than double the No. 2 recipient (Danny Green, 17.6% and 44 assists). Last season, the player most targeted by LeBron was Kyle Kuzma (who is now a valuable reserve). Right from the start, LeBron said one of his goals is to connect with Davis and make him feel comfortable. One way is to feed him whenever possible, if only to cement a connection with a player who suffered losing seasons in New Orleans and manipulated a trade to L.A. chiefly to play alongside LeBron. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s fun, because you know he\u2019ll always find you,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is.\u201d LeBron says his goal is to make everyone comfortable, not just Davis, and elevate the play of L.A.\u2019s role players. He\u2019s had that gene almost from the time he first embraced the game. Not only is he a great passer, he\u2019s a willing passer. \u201cWhen I was a little kid I was somewhat better than some of my teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cMy coach said it\u2019s a much greater reward for you to get your teammates who can\u2019t dribble or score for themselves an open look. We won the championship and we kept winning and winning and I knew that was the right way to play.\u201d In LeBron\u2019s rookie season \u2014 when he had the weakest supporting cast of his career \u2014 he averaged 5.9 assists . That number perhaps would\u2019ve been greater with more accurate shooters around him. Still, that 5.9 apg is a career low. By comparison, Damian Lillard\u2019s career average is 6.4 apg. There were times in the last 16 years when LeBron was accused of being too unselfish, especially late in games. Even if it was the right basketball play to find the open man, critics demanded LeBron take the shot whenever the game was on the line. In the 2012 All-Star Game , Kobe Bryant playfully scolded LeBron for passing in the final seconds of a tight contest. Through it all, LeBron refused to change his mindset, then and now. \u201cHe\u2019s an underrated passer when you think about it,\u201d said Suns coach Monty Williams. \u201cI mean, how many guys in the history of the game, 6-8, 6-9, 265 pounds can throw full-court passes off the dribble? In today\u2019s game you think of Kevin Love throwing the standstill pass but nobody can throw off the dribble at that size. There\u2019s not a pass that he can\u2019t throw \u2014 lob pass, bounce pass, all of his passes are on the button. So when I see the numbers this season, I\u2019m not surprised. He\u2019s done it for a long time.\u201d LeBron is the only player in history to be top 10 in scoring and assists and the only player to crack 33,000 points, 9,000 assists and 9,000 rebounds. Only five players \u2014 Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Jerry West, Tiny Archibald and Oscar Robertson \u2014 have both scoring and assist titles to their name. LeBron would be the sixth if this keeps up. In a best-case scenario where he stays healthy and motivated, LeBron can pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time scoring leader and finish second to Stockton on the assists list. That would be a strong argument for being appointed as the game\u2019s premier player. Given his size and his true position, LeBron\u2019s closest comparison as a passer is Larry Bird. Although in a sense, Bird was slightly more impressive, given his era. He played when point guards dominated the ball and were appointed as the official quarterback. Bird almost never crossed midcourt with the ball, or dominated it as much as LeBron, or played point-forward. His assists, by and large, came in the flow of the game by instinct and through spontaneous creativity. As he ages and creeps into his twilight, the one element of LeBron\u2019s game that will suffer the least slippage is his passing. It\u2019s just another reason to suspect LeBron will find a way to thrive well beyond his 17th NBA season. * * * Shaun Powell  has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Sixers look for bounce-back win Philadelphia was decidedly flat in its final game of 2019, suffering an 18-point loss to Indiana as star center Joel Embiid sat out. It won\u2019t get too much easier for the Sixers tonight as they visit Houston ( 8 ET, ESPN ), which has the NBA\u2019s best Offensive Rating (116.6) since Nov. 30 and are 12-5 in that span. Additionally, Clint Capela should be ready to go tonight (he played in the win vs. Denver on New Year\u2019s Eve ), which could provide a capable stopper for Embiid (provided he suits up tonight). 2. Different flavor to this Pelicans-Lakers matchup? Anthony Davis and the Lakers made quick work of the Pelicans in their last matchup, a Nov. 27 game that saw Davis make his return to New Orleans and light up his old team . Another showdown looms ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) but it would be folly to expect it to go like the last one. There\u2019s an enticing matchup of Davis vs. Brandon Ingram and the Pelicans are nowhere near as bad as they were back in late November (when that loss was No. 3 in a skid that would reach 13 games). In fact, since that Nov. 27 game, Ingram ranks No. 8 in total points scored . 3. Young available to play tonight Among East guards, no one has more fan votes after the first balloting returns than Trae Young . Even better for Hawks fans is that Young is available to play against the Celtics ( 7 ET, League Pass ) after he missed Atlanta\u2019s last two games because of a right ankle sprain. He has yet to play Boston this season, but in 2018-19 , he averaged 14 points, four assists and two rebounds while shooting 38.5% against the Celtics. He could be in for a big night, though, especially since Celtics star guard Kemba Walker will miss tonight\u2019s game because of the flu. 4. A league-wide tribute to Stern NBA teams and players continue to express their thoughts regarding the recent passing of NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern. The NBA announced today that all players and referees will wear a commemorative black band on their uniforms for the rest of the season and playoffs. That new addition to the uniforms is expected to begin tonight as many teams will look to honor Stern\u2019s legacy in other ways, too.

The tributes about Stern\u2019s stewardship of the league will ring loud from all corners of the globe for years to come. It\u2019s only fitting to honor the man whose audacious vision for a truly global game came to fruition while he could appreciate it. The 108 international players from 38 countries and territories on NBA rosters to start this season punctuate Stern\u2019s vision. But the fact that the leading vote-getters in the first 2020 All-Star returns just happen to be the league\u2019s two biggest international stars shines a special light on the worldwide hoops ecosystem Stern spent so much time cultivating. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic retaining their top spots in the first Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of 2020 is also no coincidence. They represent the next international wave of stars and have taken the baton from previous generations to climb into the league\u2019s elite. It\u2019s a hardened fact of life these days in the NBA, where youth is being served daily and the international influence on the game is undeniable. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver captured it best in this passage from his statement following Stern\u2019s passing : \u201cDavid took over the NBA in 1984 with the league at a crossroads. But over the course of 30 years as Commissioner, he ushered in the modern global NBA. He launched groundbreaking media and marketing partnerships, digital assets and social responsibility programs that have brought the game to billions of people around the world. Because of David, the NBA is a truly global brand \u2013 making him not only one of the greatest sports commissioners of all time but also one of the most influential business leaders of his generation.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 30.4 points, 13.0 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.2 blocks, 1.2 steals After battling through some issues during the holiday week, Antetokounmpo was back at his brilliant best (32 points, 17 rebounds, four assists, two blocks) in Wednesday\u2019s win vs. Minnesota . The Bucks are in the frontrunner role in the Eastern Conference playoff chase provided Antetokounmpo \u2014 the reigning Kia Eastern Conference Player of the Month \u2014 continues to dominate the way he has since last season. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 29.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.2 steals Doncic took over late, scoring 15 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter to lift the Mavericks over the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday . He added 13 rebounds, seven assists and a block, playing through the lingering discomfort of a bruised thigh and turning in yet another monster night for a Dallas team challenging Houston for the top spot in the Southwest Division standings . Last week: No. 3 Season stats: 38.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, 7.5 assists, 1.8 steals Harden\u2019s appreciation for teams that double team him will be tested tonight ( 8 ET, ESPN ). The Philadelphia 76ers have a roster loaded with long and athletic defenders capable of handling the assignment of guarding Harden on their own. That challenge should in turn bring out the competitive best in the West\u2019s reigning Player of the Month . In his last 10 games , Harden is shooting 51.6% overall and 48.6% on 3-pointers. Last week: No. 4 Season stats: 27.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.5 blocks, 1.4 steals Davis is playing at an elite level despite struggling with his 3-pointer this season (28.8%). But Davis can still dominate on offense without needing to exploit perimeter mismatches because of his versatile game. The best part for the Lakers is he will be infinitely more difficult for opponents to deal with if (or when) he does heat up from distance. Last week: No. 5 Season stats: 25.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 10.9 assists, 1.3 steals Fresh off turning 35 , James is celebrating his birthday in style \u2014 on and off the court. The Lakers have won three straight games after dropping four straight games before that. After his latest triple-double (31 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists vs. Phoenix on Wednesday), he continues to bolster the argument some are making for him as the game\u2019s \u201cmost complete player\u201d ever. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

Like most NBA team owners, he\u2019s seeking success in the standings and playoff appearances as proof that things are headed in the right direction. At halftime of last night\u2019s 126-112 road loss to the LA Clippers, Gores sounded as though he\u2019s perhaps ready to seek a new direction with the franchise in terms of its players. Granted, injuries \u2014 including one to star forward Blake Griffin, who has missed 17 of Detroit\u2019s 35 games \u2014 have played a part in the Pistons\u2019 12-23 start. But Gores is also aware that those maladies aren\u2019t the only reason for Detroit\u2019s mark, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a hard time with health and everything else like that and we thought we could manage (injuries) a little better,\u201d Gores said at halftime, per Rod Beard of The Detroit News . \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. We\u2019re not winning, and the record is the record, so we just have to keep plugging away.\u201d The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 6 and Gores said Thursday that he and team executives will look to assess the state of the team in the coming month. \u201cWell, we have to look at everything because we\u2019re not winning, so you\u2019re not winning, to me, you have to assess everything. I think anybody would want to do that,\u201d Gores said. \u201cAnd probably in the next month or so, we\u2019re going to get together as an organization and just discuss things.\u201d In the loss to the Clippers, the Pistons were without Griffin, guards Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard and forward Markieff Morris. \u201cWell, it\u2019s very hard to filter through that and it\u2019s been unfortunate. We expected to manage minutes and all of that stuff for our players but we\u2019ve had some bad luck, but other teams had bad luck, too, and you\u2019ve got to work through it,\u201d Gores said. \u201cI just think injuries happen. We\u2019ve had more than our share this year, but we have to build a team that can handle it.\u201d Griffin missed the first 10 games of the season and has been off all season, averaging 15.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. He still has two years and $76 million left on his deal, but Gores indicated there\u2019s no plan of how to move forward with Griffin for the rest of 2019-20. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not that far, and we\u2019re just going to assess it in the next week or so,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a trooper. If he could play, you know he\u2019d be playing, so I think we just give him a few days of rest and see what happens.\u201d Center Andre Drummond has a player option for 2020-21 and has alluded to the fact he may enter free agency. Gores said Thursday the Pistons value Drummond, but will leave that option decision up to him. \u201cAndre is going to have to make his choice \u2014 I mean Andre is a great player,\u201d Gores said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll just see. All these things are unknowns and it\u2019s kind of difficult to filter through all this little bit of health bad luck.\u201d Detroit has yet to win more than two games in a row in 2019-20 and has lost nine of its last 11 games. Already, the Pistons have had two separate losing streaks of five games and rank 24th in Defensive Rating , 26th in opponent points off turnovers and 25th in opponent points in the paint . Despite those struggles, the Pistons are 11th in the Eastern Conference and are just 3 1\/2 games behind the Orlando Magic for the No. 8 seed. The Pistons have made the playoffs only twice in 10 years after advancing at least to the Eastern Conference finals six straight years (2003-08), winning the 2004 NBA title and falling a victory short of repeating as champions in 2005. Detroit missed the playoffs the final five seasons of Joe Dumars\u2019 tenure as team president, and Gores \u2014 who took over as owner in 2011 \u2014 eventually brought Stan Van Gundy in, giving him authority in the front office in addition to his coaching duties. Van Gundy served as Pistons coach and team president , but has was relieved of both roles by the team in May of 2018 after compiling a 152-176 record. Two months later, the Pistons hired Dwane Casey as coach shortly after he was let go as coach of the Toronto Raptors. The Pistons acquired Griffin during the Van Gundy regime and the forward had a bounce-back season in 2018-19. He was an All-NBA third team selection and, under Casey, led Detroit back to the playoffs (where it lost 4-0 to the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round). Griffin a career-best 24.5 ppg last season, along with 7.5 rpg and 5.4 apg.

The six-time All-Star finished with 12 points, three rebounds and three assists in 16 minutes of action. George went to the locker room shortly before halftime and was initially considered questionable to return to the game. After the game, the team said he will be evaluated on Friday. Reserve Rodney McGruder started the second half in George\u2019s place, finishing with four points in 14 minutes. \u201cNothing happened, he just felt tightness, said it at halftime and then we just decided not to bring him back,\u201d Rivers said, per the Los Angeles Times . \u201cHe\u2019s going to be evaluated, clearly. I think it\u2019s the back more than the legs.\u201d Acquired in the offseason via trade with Oklahoma City, George has missed 11 games this season while recovering from offseason shoulder surgeries.

The Nets are coming off their fourth consecutive defeat, a 123-111 loss at Dallas, that dropped them below .500 for the first time since Nov. 22. LeVert, who signed a three-year $52 million extension last summer, averaged 16.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists in nine games before his thumb injury.

The teams says that operative and non-operative treatments will be considered, adding that his return to action will depend on how he responds to treatment and rehabilitation. \u201cWhile this certainly is disappointing news, there was no damage to his ACL, MCL and PCL ligaments,\u201d said Orlando Magic President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman. \u201cAll signs point to a complete recovery and this should not impact his future growth.\u201d Isaac had stolen the ball with 10 minutes left and was heading down court for a layup when he made contact with Wizards\u2019 Bradley Beal. Isaac attempted to crossover with a Euro-step into the lane when he and Beal made contact. He then hit the floor and grabbed his left knee as he grimaced in pain. He sat up a few minutes later and was taken off the court on a stretcher. The third-year big man is averaging 12.3 points, 9.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game (which ranks third in the NBA ).

He never did. Instead he went to Europe, Asia and plenty of other places around the world, bringing with him a league that was previously an afterthought in the U.S. and turning it into a global powerhouse. Stern, who spent 30 years as the NBA\u2019s longest-serving commissioner and one of the best in sports history, died Wednesday. He was 77. > Adam Silver\u2019s statement on passing of Commissioner Emeritus David Stern \u201cWithout David Stern, the NBA would not be what it is today,\u201d Hall of Famer Michael Jordan said. \u201cHe guided the league through turbulent times and grew the league into an international phenomenon, creating opportunities that few could have imagined before.\u201d Stern suffered a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12 and underwent emergency surgery. The league said he died with his wife, Dianne, and their family at his bedside. \u201cThe entire basketball community is heartbroken,\u201d the National Basketball Players Association said. \u201cDavid Stern earned and deserved inclusion in our land of giants.\u201d Stern had been involved with the NBA for nearly two decades before he became its fourth commissioner on Feb. 1, 1984. By the time he left his position in 2014 \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t say or let league staffers say \u201cretire,\u201d because he never stopped working \u2014 a league that fought for a foothold before him had grown to a more than $5 billion a year industry and made NBA basketball perhaps the world\u2019s most popular sport after soccer. \u201cBecause of David, the NBA is a truly global brand \u2014 making him not only one of the greatest sports commissioners of all time, but also one of the most influential business leaders of his generation,\u201d said Adam Silver, who followed Stern as commissioner. \u201cEvery member of the NBA family is the beneficiary of David\u2019s vision, generosity and inspiration.\u201d Thriving on good debate in the boardroom and good games in the arena, Stern would say one of his greatest achievements was guiding a league of mostly black players that was plagued by drug problems in the 1970s to popularity with mainstream America. He had a hand in nearly every initiative to do that, from the drug testing program, to the implementation of the salary cap, to the creation of a dress code. But for Stern, it was always about \u201cthe game,\u201d and his morning often included reading about the previous night\u2019s results in the newspaper \u2014 even after technological advances he embraced made reading NBA.com easier than ever. \u201cThe game is what brought us here. It\u2019s always about the game and everything else we do is about making the stage or the presentation of the game even stronger, and the game itself is in the best shape that it\u2019s ever been in,\u201d he said on the eve of the 2009-10 season, calling it \u201ca new golden age for the NBA.\u201d One that was largely created by Stern during a three-decade run that turned countless ballplayers into celebrities who were known around the globe by one name: Magic, Michael, Kobe, LeBron, just to name a few. Stern oversaw the birth of seven new franchises and the creation of the WNBA and NBA Development League, now the G League, providing countless opportunities to pursue careers playing basketball in the United States that previously weren\u2019t available.  Not bad for a guy who once thought his job might be a temporary one. He had been the league\u2019s outside counsel from 1966 to \u201978 and spent two years as the NBA\u2019s general counsel, figuring he could always go back to his legal career if he found things weren\u2019t working out after a couple of years. Instead, after serving as the NBA\u2019s executive vice president of business and legal affairs from 1980-84, he replaced Larry O\u2019Brien as commissioner. Overlooked and ignored only a few years earlier, when it couldn\u2019t even get its championship round on live network TV, the NBA\u2019s popularity would quickly surge thanks to the rebirth of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry behind Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, followed by the entrance of Michael Jordan just a few months after Stern became commissioner. \u201cThere are no words that can really describe the far-reaching impact of Commissioner Stern\u2019s brilliance, vision, fairness and hard work over so many years,\u201d Bird said. \u201cWhen you think of all that he accomplished worldwide on behalf of thousands of players, so many fans, all of the jobs he created for team and arena employees and all of the people that benefitted from the many layers of growth in the sport and industry that David spearheaded and then passed on to others, there is no doubt Commissioner Stern lifted the NBA to new heights and he will be greatly missed by all of us.\u201d Under Stern, the NBA would play nearly 150 international games and be televised in more than 200 countries and territories, and in more than 40 languages, and the NBA Finals and All-Star weekend would grow into international spectacles. The 2010 All-Star game drew more than 108,000 fans to Dallas Cowboys Stadium, a record to watch a basketball game. \u201cIt was David Stern being a marketing genius who turned the league around. That\u2019s why our brand is so strong,\u201d said Johnson, who announced he was retiring because of HIV in 1991 but returned the following year at the All-Star Game with Stern\u2019s backing. \u201cIt was David Stern who took this league worldwide.\u201d He was fiercely protective of his players and referees when he felt they were unfairly criticized, such as when members of the Indiana Pacers brawled with Detroit fans in 2004, or when an FBI investigation in 2007 found that Tim Donaghy had bet on games he officiated, throwing the entire referee operations department into turmoil. With his voice rising and spit flying, Stern would publicly rebuke media outlets, even individual writers, if he felt they had taken cheap shots. But he was also a relentless negotiator against those same employees in collective bargaining, and his loyalty to his owners and commitment to getting them favorable deals led to his greatest failures, lockouts in 1998 and 2011 that were the only times the NBA lost games to work stoppages. Though he had already passed off the heavy lifting to Silver by the latter one, it was Stern who faced the greatest criticism, as well as the damage to a legacy that had otherwise rarely been tarnished. \u201cAs tough an adversary as he was across the table, he never failed to recognize the value of our players, and had the vision and courage to make them the focus of our league\u2019s marketing efforts \u2014 building the NBA into the empire it is today,\u201d the NBPA said.  David Joel Stern was born Sept. 22, 1942, in New York, where he grew up a Knicks fan and worked in his fathers\u2019 deli. A graduate of Rutgers University and Columbia Law School, he was dedicated to public service, launching the NBA Cares program in 2005 that donated more than $100 million to charity in five years. He would begin looking internationally soon after becoming commissioner and the globalization of the game got an enormous boost in 1992, when Jordan, Johnson and Bird played on the U.S. Olympic Dream Team that would bring the sport a new burst of popularity while storming to the gold medal in Barcelona. Stern capitalized on that by sending NBA teams to play preseason games against other NBA or international clubs, and opened offices in other countries. The league staged regular-season games in Japan in 1991 and devoted significant resources to China, and Stern\u2019s work there would pay off in 2008 when basketball was perhaps the most popular sport in the Beijing Olympics. Growth slowed near the end of his tenure. The worldwide economic downturn in the late 2000s all but wrecked his longtime hopes of expanding overseas and led to the second lockout, with owners wanting massive changes to the salary structure after losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year on their basketball teams, on top of losses in their personal businesses. He helped get them, and the league was thriving again by the time he left office. Stern said he felt the time was right, confident that he had groomed a worthy successor in Silver. Silver, who worked for Stern for 22 years, is praised for his achievements since becoming commissioner. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman also worked under Stern at the NBA, former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue called him a great friend and ally on important issues, and many other executives in and out of sports have said they learned from the way Stern did business. \u201cBest leader in sports history,\u201d Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis said. Stern stayed busy after leaving the league office, taking trips overseas on the NBA\u2019s behalf, doing public speaking and consulting various companies. He was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014. Stern and his wife had two sons, Andrew and Eric."},{"id":29718,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-20-kia-rookie-ladder-jan-2","date":"2020-01-02","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Denver gets glimpse of Michael Porter Jr.'s potential","content":" It\u2019s been a long time coming, but the Denver Nuggets are finally getting a good look at Michael Porter Jr.\u2019s breakout potential. Porter Jr., the No. 14 pick in the 2018 Draft who missed the entire 2018-19 season while recovering from back surgery , got his first start with the Nuggets on Sunday, and made the most of it. Porter scored 19 points on 8-for-10 shooting while playing a career-high 26 minutes, filling in for Gary Harris to lead Denver to a 120-115 win over the Kings. Porter scored in a variety of ways , hitting several easy shots in the lane, a few smooth jumpers and capping it off with an emphatic putback dunk. It was Porter\u2019s first start since 2017, when he was at the University of Missouri, but he felt right at home. \u201dI was just wanting to blend with that starting group and do what I could on the court,\u201d said Porter, who has struggled to find regular playing time. \u201dI feel less nervous starting just because you go straight from warming up into the game instead of sitting down and watching. It felt pretty natural.\u201d Porter has been a fan favorite in Denver , with the crowd cheering his every entrance as they look to grasp on any signs of him breaking out. Coach Michael Malone knows he\u2019s got a future star in Porter, and that his time will come. \u201cI knew that Michael \u2014 if he is given minutes and given a chance to play \u2014 he is just too talented, the game comes too easy for him, especially offensively. I\u2019ve seen a lot of growth recently on the defensive end of the floor,\u201d Malone said after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling rebounding the basketball. He is so tall, so long, he helps run the glass. He\u2019s coming along, I appreciate how patient he has been. I know it has not been easy, but he gets a chance to start tonight and I was excited about that opportunity for him. He went out and played great. That is just a glimpse of what is to come.\u201d Two nights later, Porter saw 11 minutes off the bench, scoring seven points and grabbing three rebounds in the Nuggets\u2019 130-104 loss to the Rockets. It\u2019s early, and the last three games might be an aberration, but the Nuggets will need a strong bench if they hope to make a deep playoff run. Porter Jr. could be just the guy they need to be contenders. * * * Last edition: No. 1 Morant has seen his scoring numbers dip, but the Grizzlies are in the midst of a winning stretch that has them two games out of the 8th spot in the West. Over his past three games , Morant is averaging 10.7 points and 6.0 assists while shooting 46.4%. Most importantly, he\u2019s playing under control: he\u2019s got a 2.1 assist\/turnover ratio in 2019-20. Last edition: No. 2 When you accomplish something faster than Dwyane Wade, you\u2019re doing things right. Nunn became the fastest rookie in Heat history to score 500 points this week, hitting 504 in 31 career game (Wade got to 508 in his 32nd game). Nunn also became the fastest undrafted rookie since 1976 to reach 500 points. Nunn has averaged 13.2 points over his past five games , but his 3-point shooting has dipped a bit (28.6% in that span), which is something to keep an eye on.  Last edition: No. 3 In the five games since our last Rookie Ladder, Herro has continued to put up efficient shooting numbers, hitting at a 43.6% clip overall and 44.4% on 3-pointers. His 13.7 ppg also ranks fifth among all rookies . Given that the Heat are in the thick of the Eastern Conference hunt, it\u2019s no wonder the team has reportedly made him untouchable in any potential trade talks. Last edition: Not ranked After missing two weeks with a fractured finger, Washington returned Dec. 27 and hasn\u2019t skipped a beat. In the three games back (all losses), Washington averaged 15.0 points and 4.7 rebounds while shooting 48.6% overall and 53.8% on 3-pointers. The Hornets are in a tailspin, having lost six straight, so Washington\u2019s return could be the boost they need. Last edition: No. 5 Clarke continues to put up big numbers while shooting at a ridiculously efficient rate. In his past four games, the No. 21 pick averaged 14.0 points while shooting 63.9% overall (3-for-6 on 3s). The Grizzlies finished December with an 8-8 record and are just two games out of 8th in the West, and Clarke is a big reason for that resurgence, thanks to his 64.5% shooting on the season.

NBA continues to mourn Stern\u2019s passing There\u2019s so much to be said about the legacy NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern left that a few sentences here can hardly do it justice. Tributes poured in on social media from NBA legends, the Knicks paid tribute to him last night and NBA stars-turned-analysts such as Charles Barkley , Kevin McHale , Isiah Thomas , Marques Johnson and more reflected on his impact on not just the NBA, but the sports world at large. More tributes are sure to pour in tonight \u2014 there are nine games on tap , after all \u2014 and we\u2019ll be watching for all of it. 2. Potential All-Star showdown in Indianapolis Nikola Jokic already has All-Star credentials to his name, having made the All-Star Game last season. But don\u2019t overlook the work Domantas Sabonis is putting in with the Pacers as his squad hosts Denver tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ). Indiana has the East\u2019s third-best record since Dec. 1 and during that span, Sabonis has been a beast \u2014 particularly on the glass ( 13.6 rpg since Dec. 1 ). He and Jokic have also been great playmakers in that span, too, with both ranking in the Top 4 in assists among centers since Dec. 1. 3. Another challenge for Raptors Toronto has kept it together since losing Pascal Siakam, Marc Gasol and Norman Powell to injury on Dec. 18, going 5-3 since then . A deeper look, though, shows that record is a bit hollow as the Raptors have gone 2-3 against teams over .500 during that stretch. As they host the Heat ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ), the onus is on Kyle Lowry to keep up the increased productivity he\u2019s enjoyed since Dec. 18 (24.5 ppg, 41.1% on 3-pointers). He\u2019ll be looking to bounce back after going 2-for-18 in a Dec. 3 road loss to Miami.  4. Star guards collide in Dallas A Kia MVP favorite (Luka Doncic) and a rising star (Spencer Dinwiddie) collide in Dallas ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) in what will be the third meeting of their careers . The squads are slumping a bit (Brooklyn has lost three in a row; Dallas is at two straight losses) with the Nets trying to keep things together despite a myriad of injuries. After ranking 12th in the NBA in rebounding in November ( 10.3 rpg ), Doncic ranked 29th in that category last month ( 8.7 rpg ). As for Dinwiddie, he ranks second in the NBA in scoring ( 31.5 ppg ) since Dec. 17. 5. Griffin heads back to L.A. (again) Right around this time last year, Blake Griffin made his first trip back to face the LA Clippers and had himself a game , finishing with 44 points in Detroit\u2019s win. The same scenario is here again ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) but Griffin is struggling through injury issues this season and the Clippers are a drastically different team . Griffin missed the Pistons\u2019 last game ( a 104-81 loss to Utah ) and overall, his play seems to be cratering this season. In short, there should be plenty of juicy subplots to watch at Staples Center tonight."},{"id":29699,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-darren-collison-mulling-nba-return","date":"2020-01-01","title":"Report: Darren Collison mulling return to NBA","content":" Point guard Darren Collsion shocked NBA followers with his sudden retirement last summer.

Additionally, the Clippers and Lakers are atop his wish list of teams he wants to play for. Several contenders have monitored Collison\u2019s interest in an NBA return and have stayed in touch with his agent, Wojnarowski reports. Collison is unlikely to return to the NBA before the Feb. 6 trade deadline, Wojnarowski reports. Grizzlies forward Andre Iguodala, whom Memphis acquired from Golden State last summer, is also a player the Lakers and Clippers are competing to acquire via trade, Wojnarowski reports. Last summer, Collison stunned the NBA by announcing via letter on ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated that he was retiring after a 10-year career. He cited religious reasons for his sudden NBA departure. \u201cWhile I still love basketball, I know there is something more important, which is my family and my faith. I am one of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and my faith means everything to me.\u201d Drafted out of UCLA in 2009, Collison played for the New Orleans Hornets, Indiana Pacers, Dallas Mavericks, LA Clippers and Sacramento Kings. Collison, 31, averaged 11.2 points, 6.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game last season, his second with the Pacers. He is a career 39.4 percent 3-point shooter and led the league with a 46.8 3-point percentage two seasons ago.

Now we know why. What Malone understood all along is you can trap the decade\u2019s leading scorer all you want, but it\u2019s an exercise in futility when the rest of the Rockets knock down shots the way they did on the final night of 2019 in a dominant 130-104 win at the Toyota Center. \u201cThe reality is this: if you put two on the ball, somebody else has to make a play,\u201d Malone explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t put two on the ball and guard the other guys. You have to give something up. Some guys [during the last matchup] were hesitant, and that\u2019s exactly what we want, and what they don\u2019t want.\u201d What the Nuggets got on this night though was a Houston supporting cast itching to make plays. \u201cWe\u2019re just more prepared,\u201d said Harden, who finished with a game-high 35 points, including 20 in the second half on just 10 shots. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that so many times now. We were just in attack mode. Guys were knocking down shots. They\u2019re very aggressive on their closeouts, so guys made the right plays as far as taking their shots, which is obviously making another play for somebody else.\u201d Take away Harden\u2019s 15 points in the first half, and the rest of the Rockets scorched the Nuggets for 54 points on 22-for-39 shooting as Houston took a 69-52 lead into intermission on the strength of crisp ball movement. Russell Westbrook and Eric Gordon \u2014 in his second game back since returning from arthroscopic knee surgery \u2014 combined for 28 points over the first two quarters. \u201cWe did a good job of making the right plays,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThe ball found the right person.\u201d With Gordon back in the mix, the Rockets not only have another solid shooter, but a secondary ballhandler and creator to pair with Westbrook and take pressure off Harden when teams double him. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to have Eric back,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHe\u2019s a knock-down shooter that got to the rim a couple of times. But I think overall, everybody from top to bottom that got in the game were energized on both ends of the ball, and it showed.\u201d While Denver\u2019s early-season success at trapping and doubling Harden might have provided a blueprint for the rest of the league to copy, it also gave Houston valuable reps at cracking the code against some of the defenses they might see down the road in the playoffs. Malone was the first coach in the league this season to trap Harden at midcourt from the opening tip to the final buzzer, and although the Nuggets tried to mix it up this go-round, they employed a very similar game plan yielding drastically different results. Malone mentioned that ever since that November victory, \u201cteams have double-teamed them in every way imaginable.\u201d That\u2019s changed the way Harden and the Rockets are attacking those varying looks. Malone noticed some of the changes on film. \u201cWith James, he\u2019s baiting that double team now,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s [like], \u2018O.K., [they] put two on the ball,\u2019 [and] he\u2019s trusting his teammates to make a play. It\u2019s probably frustrating for him, but he should take it as a sign of huge respect because people are game planning to get the ball out of the [hands] of the best scorer in recent memory.\u201d Harden validated Malone\u2019s observations in the second quarter by baiting the double-team, then tossing a cross-court dime to Danuel House Jr. standing in the weakside corner for a 3-pointer as the first-half buzzer sounded. The 3-pointer was one of the 16 drained by the Rockets on the night against a Nuggets squad that entered the game leading the NBA in 3-point defense, limiting opponents to just 31.4% from beyond the arc. In this outing, the Rockets connected at 47.1% on 3-pointers. Most importantly, Houston masterfully countered Denver\u2019s double teams on Harden after struggling in the previous meeting. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it a thousand times, every game,\u201d Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more comfortable with it. It shouldn\u2019t work in theory. If you just double him, he throws it to Russell [Westbrook] and it\u2019s 4-on-3. We should score every time. P.J. [Tucker] is getting that little lob now where he gets in the middle sometimes and he\u2019s making plays. I think they\u2019re getting better at it. We\u2019re not surprised by it. They don\u2019t rush. \u201cYou know, you see something that\u2019s kind of odd [at first]. Now it\u2019s not odd, so we should be able to handle it. The only time the doubles have really worked against us was when we were tired and we struggled with our legs. Then we try things, being tired and not real smart [decisions]. When that\u2019s happened, we\u2019ve struggled with it. If we have some energy, it\u2019s been pretty good.\u201d That certainly was the case against the Nuggets. In fact, Denver all but abandoned double teaming Harden in the second half, and it wasn\u2019t a decision made by the Nuggets coaching staff. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a question for our players because we never told them to go away from it,\u201d Malone said. \u201c Our guys got somewhat tentative, and I thought in Game 1 we committed to it. We were aggressive. It was effective. As I mentioned after Game 1, it was effective that night. By no means did we think we had figured out the riddle of the Sphinx. \u201cBut tonight was a different game, and [Harden] had answers for it. We just became very, very hesitant with trying to employ our game plan. And when you\u2019re hesitant in anything, bad things are gonna happen. Now you\u2019re caught in between, and you\u2019re giving up everything.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Joel Embiid will not play in Tuesday\u2019s matinee against the Indiana Pacers ( 3 ET, League Pass ) because of left knee soreness. Embiid played in the Sixers\u2019 last seven games , averaging 26.6 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.7 blocks in 31.8 minutes per game. Only one game separates Indiana from Philadelphia in the East standings. Philadelphia went 3-4 during Embiid\u2019s seven-game stretch, notching a big win against the Milwaukee Bucks on Christmas Day , but then losing its next two games ( against Orlando and Miami , respectively). The Sixers beat the Pacers 119-116 in the first meeting between the teams on Nov. 30 in Philadelphia. In that game, Sixers guard Ben Simmons sealed the victory with three big steals down the stretch. Embiid was particularly strong in that game as well, finishing with 32 points and 11 boards while going 15-for-15 from the free throw line. Embiid\u2019s absence means Al Horford will likely move over to center and other frontcourt adjustments will take place.

Matinee showdown in East The Sixers and Pacers are in the upper crust of the Eastern Conference, ranking fifth and sixth, respectively. Only one game separates Indiana from Philadelphia and the last time they played (Nov. 30), it was a thrilling game won by the Sixers. Indiana gets a bit of a break today ( 3 ET, League Pass ), though as Joel Embiid will not suit up for this game. In the last Pacers-Sixers game, Embiid had 32 points and 11 boards while going 15-for-15 from the free throw line. 2. Murray vs. Westbrook in spotlight The Nuggets have won nine of their last 10 games and seem to be on the rise out West. The Rockets have lost two of three games, including a stunning defeat Sunday in New Orleans (albeit without Russell Westbrook and James Harden). The teams meet tonight ( 7 ET, NBA TV ) for the first time since a Nov. 20 contest that Denver won 105-95 thanks to its aggressive defense . Westbrook and Harden should be OK to go tonight, but it will be worth watching Denver\u2019s Michael Porter Jr., who had a stellar showing in his first career start Dec. 29. 3. Clippers\u2019 depth takes a hit The LA Clippers continue to stay in the thick of the West playoff chase, standing a mere 3 1\/2 games behind the Lakers for the No. 1 spot. As they face the Kings this afternoon ( 5 ET, League Pass ), they will reportedly be without guard Patrick Beverley, who will reportedly miss several games with a sprained right wrist. His absence will likely push Lou Williams into a bigger role while Kawhi Leonard and others are also capable playmakers for the Clippers. 4. Closing out an NBA decade Hard to believe it, but at midnight ET the 2010s of the NBA will draw to a close. If you\u2019ve missed it, we\u2019ve had plenty of content to celebrate the decade that was from our All-Decade Team to a look back at broken records , past MVP winners , All-Star moments , playoff moments , LeBron\u2019s run of Finals appearances , big offseason moves and so much more .

It\u2019s his birthday week, after all ( he turned 35 on Monday ), so show the old man some love. Even if you don\u2019t root for him, you must appreciate what he\u2019s done. Instead of nit-picking his every move (on and off the floor), his game and legacy or complaining about him comping up short in a huge moment (as in the end of a Christmas Day showdown with the LA Clippers ), I\u2019m going to ring in 2020 with newfound appreciation for a man who has spent literally half his life providing memories for everyone. Where LeBron ranks in several key stats \u2014 before he turned 35 \u2014 is mind-blowing. He\u2019s second to Kobe Bryant (1,239) in games played at 1,230 . He\u2019s second to Tony Parker (830) in wins with 815 and ranks ahead of ranks first, ahead of Bryant, in points (33,347) and minutes (47,354) . James\u2019 career quality and longevity is something we might not see for generations, given all the things that can impact any career. Sure, you may not like the way he does some things. Or, you think putting him on par with Michael Jordan (or even Bryant) shouldn\u2019t be done due to his lack of titles or whatever. That\u2019s your prerogative. But there\u2019s no hate for LeBron as 2020 begins \u2014 despite what some of his most ardent supporters and admirers accused me of in the latest Kia MVP Ladder. Congratulate LeBron on a marvelous career to date and we\u2019ll see what he has left in the tank during the remainder of his 17th NBA season. Odds and ends:  Save the venom you\u2019ve been aiming at Chris Paul for someone else. While plenty assumed he wouldn\u2019t last this long in Oklahoma City, it\u2019s Paul who is getting the last word on how his Thunder career plays out. He\u2019s been vital to the development of youngsters like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder and led OKC on a thus-far improbable playoff chase. There is something to be said for a player who exudes class and professionalism in a tough situation \u2026 The sight of Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball draining 3-pointers like he was an honorary Splash Brother was a sight to see. His 27-point explosion in Sunday\u2019s win vs. Houston continues a hot stretch for Ball, who is shooting 39.7% on 3-pointers over his last 10 games. His outstanding game vs. Houston \u2014 seven 3-pointers, 10 rebounds, eight assists, two steals \u2014 was a reminder of why he went No. 2 overall in the 2017 draft . \u2026 Hands off Luka. That\u2019s the message sent loud and clear to Golden State\u2019s Marquese Chriss, who was fined $35,000 for shoving the Mavs\u2019 star in Saturday\u2019s game. As much as Draymond Green loved it, those high fives won\u2019t pay that fine. And the league is better with Luka healthy and on his feet. Players of the Week :  Youth is being served as Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown and New Orleans\u2019 Brandon Ingram collect the honors. Brown has been on a tear recently, scoring 30 points in a Christmas Day win in Toronto and then a career-high 34 in a win vs. Cleveland on Friday. Both he and Jayson Tatum should be strong contenders for All-Star honors this season. Ingram has been on fire during the Pelicans\u2019 four-game win streak. An otherwise tough season turned up with a win over Portland two days before Christmas. Three wins later, Ingram was huge in an upset of the Rockets (27 points, six rebounds, four assists, two steals). Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Jesse Heighway Dec. 28, 2019 | 6:21 a.m. 1. Can Kawhi or Paul George win MVP while playing just 60 odd matches \u2014 think of that as they start to tear up the court and dominate? 2. What does James Harden have to do to win the MVP? He\u2019s stepped up his defense, he\u2019s racking up dimes and collecting boards while ranking 6th in the NBA in steals . Do you reckon James Harden is taking too many shots and carrying too much of the load for the Rockets? And, do you reckon this style of play could work during The Finals? 3. Where would Ja Morant be ranked on your MVP ratings, cause I believe that he\u2019s ahead of a few of those players you\u2019ve put down (such as Chris Paul).What do you think of this? 4. In that Christmas Day game against the Warriors (and in many others where teams decide to double team Harden when he crosses half court), he flicks out passes to people like Russell Westbrook, Danuel House Jr. and Ben McLemore. They\u2019ve got open 3-point shots. But when they receive those sorts of passes, they don\u2019t usually look to take the open shot. Instead they unbearably drive into a clogged lane and either kick it out (to repeat all this) or they take unnecessary shots against taller opponents. Why do you think this happens? How should the Rockets counter this and what does a championship-winning or Western Conference finals-winning Rockets team look like? How will they have to play? Do they have the right players? And, lastly, would Chris Paul have been better beside Harden than Westbrook. * * * My response: Wow.  This feels like a test. But a nyone who comes up with all these questions should get some answers. 1. I think it\u2019s very difficult for Kawhi, PG or anyone to win MVP playing so few games, mostly because there are others in the field who will undoubtedly play more and that will carry more weight with voters. 2. Harden must keep doing what he\u2019s doing and hope for some serious slippage in Milwaukee to mount a serious challenge. He\u2019s stuck in that strange space where the MVP is concerned. People acknowledge his greatness \u2026 but it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s expected (and not celebrated) after all these seasons of seeing his crazy scoring feats. That said, if he averages 40 for the season, he\u2019ll sway some voters for sure. 3. Ja is having a monster rookie season and should be the frontrunner for Kia Rookie of the Year. He\u2019s not on my MVP radar yet, which is normal for a rookie. We need to see a whole lot more before we throw him into that Kia MVP mix. But he\u2019s clearly on the right track. 4. More Rockets stuff, huh? Cool. They play the way they do because that\u2019s what works around Harden. They are a team crafted specifically to function in Harden\u2019s orbit. The Rockets must be better defensively if they want to challenge for the West crown. Come the West finals (if they make it there), the defensive competition will be elite. Unfortunately for them, the Rockets\u2019 biggest deficiency is in that area. We know how successful the Rockets were a couple of seasons ago with CP3 and Harden together. There\u2019s nothing that tells me they can\u2019t be every bit as good with Westbrook and Harden. And yet it doesn\u2019t mean I think this group is capable of winning a championship. They\u2019re flawed but capable of the unthinkable under the right set of circumstances \u2014 like several teams in the league. * * * From:  Josh May Dec. 26, 2019 | 9:44 a.m. I\u2019m writing this after the Christmas Day games, so some things have changed but Joel Embiid clearly should be in the top 10 after the Sixers\u2019 convincing win over the Bucks . JoJo is back to his form from last season and is not letting people forget about him. In his last 16 games , the Sixers are 12-4, with Embiid averaging 23.2 points, 13.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.3 blocks per game on 46.1% from the field. Once the Sixers pass the Heat and Celtics in the standings, Embiid should be right there in the MVP conversation. Thanks again for your work on this and have a wonderful holiday season! * * * My response: You must be careful with your Embiid praise, Josh. Take it from someone who knows. Every time I get a good vibe from Embiid, he and the Sixers follow it up with the performance they delivered in that Friday night loss in Orlando . He was back to his focused best in Saturday\u2019s overtime loss in Miami . But the Sixers can\u2019t afford the sort of inconsistency they\u2019ve gotten from the big fella this season and expect to go beyond where they did in the 2019 playoffs. Embiid is on probation until further notice with the Kia MVP Ladder committee. From:  Coran B Dec. 26, 2019 | 11 a.m. First of all, Sekou, I would like to take a moment to agree with you. Giannis is obviously at the top, LeBron is averaging close to a triple-double, Luka is cooling down because of his injury and I don\u2019t see much room for Harden in the top 5. Harden may be good, but as we saw in the game against the Warriors that he can\u2019t do much if you actually defend him. The MVP is the most valuable player. Harden is valuable to the Rockets, but he is not more valuable than Kemba Walker is to the Celtics right now. I think that the Celtics are such a better team with him. Kemba\u2019s priority is winning and whatever he has to do to make that happen \u2013 scoring, getting assists or whatever \u2014 he is going to do it. He is taking the Celtics much farther than Harden will take the Rockets. I think that mentality \u2013 along with his skill \u2014 makes him an MVP candidate. From:  Cooper Hansen Dec. 27, 2019 | 1:44 p.m. Hi Sekou, my name is Cooper and I want to say that I think Kemba Walker should be higher up on this list! he has slightly lower numbers then a few people up there, but his impact on the Celtics is very good. He has led the team to the 2nd seed in the East \u2014 something Kyrie Irving couldn\u2019t do in Boston. * * * My response: Fellas, you are preaching to the choir about Kemba. (If you don\u2019t believe me, check out this Kia MVP Mailbag where I got grief for having him in the top 5). He\u2019s been everything the Celtics could have hoped when they went after him in free agency to replace Kyrie. The final grade, of course, comes in the postseason. Will he be able to take the Celtics somewhere Kyrie couldn\u2019t? There will be lingering questions no matter how well he performs between now and mid-April. From:   Cooper Hansen Dec. 24, 2019 | 12:12 p.m. I do think that James Harden should be above guys like LeBron. You could argue that LeBron has more talent and a more diverse game, but Harden is still handing out 7.5 apg while averaging almost 40 ppg. This is probably an unpopular opinion, but Harden has revolutionized the game as we haven\u2019t seen a great scorer like him for a while. To me, the rankings should be: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2 . James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Luka Doncic (provided he\u2019s healthy) 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Anthony Davis 7. Pascal Siakam 8. Kemba Walker 9. Paul George 10. Kawhi Leonard * * *  My response:  Coop, my man, (I hope I can call you that because Cooper sounds so formal). I don\u2019t know if I agree with Harden as a hoops revolutionary. He\u2019s pushed it, no doubt, with his singular approach to scoring in creative, new ways. But LeBron is far more revolutionary than Harden over the course of his career. And Harden\u2019s rise has come after and overlapped with a couple of other scoring revolutionaries (Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry) who might hear their names brought up before Harden\u2019s when we revisit this topic years from now. We\u2019ve got to stop with the blatant disrespect for LeBron. He\u2019s earned that much \u2026 hasn\u2019t he? From:  Ashton Phoenix Dec. 25, 2019 | 11:22 a.m. Hey Sekou, Ashton from the Philippines here. Just wondering \u2026 what place do you have Trae Young now? I mean the Hawks aren\u2019t winning, but where do you have him? If wins don\u2019t matter in the MVP race, will you put him in the top 5? * * * My response: His wicked numbers haven\u2019t moved the needle, Ashton. Those numbers with no context are tougher to evaluate for some folks. For me, the numbers and impact must correlate in some way. Otherwise, what are these guys playing for? From:  Emmett Dunn Dec. 24, 2019 | 5:30 p.m. Hey Sekou. I personally feel like the Lakers rely on AD much more than LeBron, and it\u2019s unfair to keep LeBron this high when he\u2019s not even the best player on his team. Of course, he\u2019s still a great player, but his impact and level of play isn\u2019t nearly as high as some of the other candidates. I also feel like we overlook Harden\u2019s greatness right now because of what some feel like is a poor style of play. Also, when Kawhi is on the floor he is a definite candidate, too. However, I understand punishing his rank for load management. My ladder would look like this: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. James Harden 3. Anthony Davis 4. Luka Doncic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. LeBron James 7. Jimmy Butler 8. Joel Embiid 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Spencer Dinwiddie * * * My response:  NOPE! I\u2019m not going through this again, Emmitt. Scroll back up and please read those words again. From:  Wizz PlayZ Dec. 24, 2019 | 3:54 p.m. I think that Butler and Harden should be higher on the list because of their value to their team. For example, without Butler, the Heat wouldn\u2019t even be a playoff team. Without Harden, the Rockets would be struggling for a playoff spot. Here\u2019s my list: 1.James Harden 2.Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LeBron James 4. Jimmy Butler 5. Anthony Davis Luka is injured, but if healthy, he would be on the list, too. * * * My response:  Luka has returned since you wrote this Wizz, so I\u2019ll give you a pass on that one. I disagree, though. I think Luka belongs in the top five. And you are correct, there is an extremely strong case to be made for Jimmy to join that top group as well. Come back Friday and see if that\u2019s the case. From:  Alexander Roedeske Dec. 24, 2019 | 4:23 p.m. Hello again, Sekou. Thank you for responding to my last MVP ladder mailbag question. I know that winning matters. That being said, Domantas Sabonis has been a star in Indiana. Not only is he posting 17.4 ppg, 13.4 rpg and 50.4% shooting , but the Pacers are 21-12 as December ends \u2013 all of this done without Victor Oladipo. I believe Sabonis should be ranked higher than 15. He may not reach the Top 10 yet, but from what he\u2019s doing he\u2019s ranked 12 in my ladder. Here\u2019s the Top 15 on my Ladder (it\u2019s my dream to be an NBA analyst \u2026): 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2 . Luka Doncic 3. James Harden 4. LeBron James 5. Pascal Siakam 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jimmy Butler 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Kemba Walker 10. Paul George 11. Donavan Mitchell 12. Domantas Sabonis 13. Joel Embiid 14. Nikola Jokic 15. Chris Paul The most difficult choice I had in this ladder was LeBron. Despite his age, he\u2019s still doing very well, and Luka\u2019s injury might hurt his chances. And it\u2019s hard to put Harden so high up knowing he\u2019s abusing the power of drawing fouls. But it\u2019s also smart. What should I change? I hope you can agree with most of the players on here and again thank you. \u2014 Xander My response: This is good stuff, Xander. And for the record, I need a little more time before you come take my job. But you were thorough here. I appreciate you putting your own spin on the MVP race. That\u2019s the point, after all. Happy New Year to you as well. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But through the first eight weeks of the season, the Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks were head and shoulders above the rest of the league, each winning 24 of their first 27 games. The Lakers were set to be the first top-five defense that LeBron James played for since the 2011-12 Miami Heat. The Bucks were picking up where they were before losing four straight games in the Eastern Conference finals. And then came Christmas, when the Clippers and Sixers knocked off the Lakers and Bucks, respectively. The Clips put the clamps on a Lakers\u2019 offense that ranks 24th in effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint. Philly took advantage of a Milwaukee defense that is on pace to set another record for 3-pointers allowed. But the Lakers and Bucks have remained the more consistent teams in their conference. The Clippers have lost four of their last seven games, while the Sixers have lost five of their last eight. Maybe the Christmas results are the most important, and maybe consistency matters more. Some increased parity (within the league\u2019s two distinct tiers) has made this, perhaps, the most difficult week of the season to put 30 teams in order from best to worst.
