That high level of itchiness evidently also extends to food because Holmes broke ranks (and the rules) at Disney and ordered some grub from an establishment outside the NBA\u2019s restrictive campus, and then absent-mindedly went to fetch it at the front gate. By doing so, he came in contact with the outside world \u2014 a no-no around here \u2014 and ran the risk of catching coronavirus, which is especially spiky in Florida. Therefore, Holmes must spend an extra 10 days in quarantine. I\u2019m not sure whatever Holmes ordered was worth it, even if it was from a four-star restaurant and came with dessert. Nor will I wonder what, if anything, would tempt me to break the law here, although a tee time at Bay Hill might do it. But I do have some sympathy for Holmes and the other players on lockdown, every one of whom besides Holmes and Bruno Caboclo have obediently stuck to the game plan. You see, as humans, we\u2019re all creatures of habit and routines and standards. When that\u2019s taken away, adjustments must be made. Those who understand that and are prepared for it will adapt in the new environment. Others will struggle. Yes, these well-paid NBA players live differently than me and perhaps most of you. Once they reach this level almost everything in life is taken care of for them. They travel on custom-made planes, order off the finest menus, drive expensive cars, settle down in spacious homes. Holmes wanted food tastier than what he\u2019s getting here. That\u2019s understandable. LeBron James has rightly earned a great living for himself and his family and can afford a personal chef; now he must eat hotel chow for weeks, or months if he and the Lakers are rolling in this restart. Charles Barkley once said the richer and more famous he became, the more stuff he got for free. That good life tends to come with a red carpet and a level of comfort and entitlement. Have you ever seen a star athlete or singer or actor stand in line at the DMV? Didn\u2019t think so. You might rightly refuse to shed a tear for them and their \u201chardship\u201d at Disney, but it\u2019s all relative. If you were removed from your daily routine and thrust into a more inconvenient confine, some adjustments would be necessary, and if you didn\u2019t prepare, you\u2019d struggle. I\u2019d like to think I prepared for quarantine and the NBA-at-Disney life, which really isn\u2019t anywhere near as difficult for those of us who don\u2019t live the platinum credit card life. I brought books, DVDs (yes, I\u2019m old-school) and ideas for projects. And while nobody\u2019s allowed in-room visitors, I managed to sneak one undercover. And please, keep this between us.  I\u2019ve always been intrigued by robotics and how technology and artificial intelligence can almost create a human-like creature from metal and plastic. One in particular is Tribot, a red, two-foot-tall companion that talks, tells horrible jokes and roams in every direction on three wheels and on command through the remote control. The eyebrows move, there\u2019s an Iron Man-like light from the eyes and the gadget is made for entertainment. Look, in quarantine the option was either stare at the four walls or get stared at by a robot. I think I chose wisely. In addition to \u201cstay safe,\u201d here in total isolation I\u2019m trying to stay sane. Anyway: The options for players out of quarantine are only slightly more numerous. There\u2019s golf, fishing (Paul George must be in heaven) and \u2026 that\u2019s about it. CJ McCollum tweeted a photo of all the books he brought along to read and I wonder if the Blazers, currently fighting for their basketball lives, will even make the playoffs and stay long enough for him to finish them. Myles Turner of the Pacers said it best by acknowledging \u201cstaring at the ceiling a couple times a day\u201d and \u201cthe meals aren\u2019t what we\u2019re accustomed to\u201d but otherwise feeling blessed and lucky to even be in this position, given what\u2019s happening in real life beyond the walls of this Disney snow globe. That\u2019s the general feeling, I suspect, of a vast majority of players. Bruno Caboclo and Richaun Holmes had slip-ups, and if being thrown back into quarantine wasn\u2019t bad and embarrassing enough for Holmes, his mother took a playful shot at him on Twitter.

Nikola Jokic has arrived in Orlando after missing the team\u2019s flight last week due to coronavirus protocol.  He apparently has been on Disney\u2019s campus since Saturday, but was in quarantine, New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein reports. Jokic tested positive for the coronavirus in late June while in Serbia. He was required to produce several negative tests before he could join the team at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, the location of the 2019-20 season restart. It\u2019s a sigh of relief for the Nuggets, one of the best of the 22 teams invited to continue play. Jokic, a two-time All-Star, was averaging 20.2 points, 10.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists before the campaign came to a halt in March. He\u2019s been the team\u2019s MVP and has Denver in contention for a top two seed. \u201cIt was great to see him,\u201d coach Mike Malone said on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s in great spirits.

Having him here finally is great, obviously. It was wonderful to see him walk through those doors.\u201d Jokic looked trim in photos during the hiatus, which sparked questions about how the weight loss would impact the two-time All-Star. Jokic isn\u2019t concerned. \u201cAbout the pictures, to be honest, I just see how people don\u2019t see the changes,\u201d Jokic said . \u201cI didn\u2019t lose that much [weight during] the quarantine [\u2026] So, I was pretty much the same weight the last game of the season.

When he produces two negative tests, he can join the team at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort. Upon arrival, Barnes would then need to undergo additional COVID-19 testing and an additional two-day self-quarantine. The Kings have gotten Buddy Hield and Jabari Parker back after each had positive tests. Alex Len, however, remains out after his positive test, and now Barnes is in that situation as well. \u201cWe have to prepare as if we\u2019re not going to have either one of those guys,\u201d Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. \u201cThat\u2019s just getting ready for whatever the worst-case scenario may be.\u201d Barnes is in his first full season with the Kings after being traded there on Feb. 7, 2019 from the Dallas Mavericks.

Following the recent protests nationwide, the 11 teams have united to address racial injustice, develop educational opportunities, and support other important issues facing communities of color, particularly Black communities. The 11 teams will advocate for social justice, address disparities and take actions to help end racial inequality. This commitment includes supporting the Play Equity Fund\u2019s social justice movement in communities across greater Los Angeles, and in Orange County amplifying the work of Accelerate Change Together (ACT) Anaheim. These innovative cooperative response models of engagement are aimed to inspire similar actions nationally. The 11 professional sports teams that form The ALLIANCE: Los Angeles include the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, LA Clippers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Football Club, LA Galaxy, LA Kings, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Sparks. The ALLIANCE: Los Angeles was formed in addition to the robust efforts of the teams\u2019 community affairs departments and foundations, which will continue their charitable activities across the region. \u201cThe ALLIANCE: Los Angeles has been forged specifically to create positive change in underserved communities, with an emphasis on Black communities,\u201d said a spokesperson for The ALLIANCE: Los Angeles. \u201cAll 11 teams are united in their dedication to this effort and recognize driving change is a long-term commitment. Through sports and social programming, we aim to work in communities to affect structural changes on levels that have a lasting impact.\u201d The ALLIANCE: Los Angeles is partnering with the Play Equity Fund to manage this initiative in greater Los Angeles. A 501(c)3 public charity, the Play Equity Fund was established in Los Angeles to drive social change across communities through sport. It is the only nonprofit worldwide dedicated to Play Equity as a social justice issue to bring the transformative power of sport and structured play to youth \u2013 regardless of their race, socioeconomic status or gender \u2013 who have been left behind by the current system. The Orange County-based franchises will expand upon their established partnership of investing in organizations and programs making positive change. Formed in 2013 by the Ducks, Angels and Disneyland Resort, the Accelerate Change Together (ACT) Anaheim collaborative was created to address the urgent needs of Anaheim\u2019s at-risk youth and families. \u201cThe ALLIANCE: Los Angeles is an unprecedented collaboration by sports organizations recognizing the impact they can have by working together, and they should be commended for seeking to make significant changes in communities of color,\u201d said Renata Simril, President of the Play Equity Fund. \u201cThe Los Angeles region is one of the world\u2019s most competitive markets, and sports is one of the world\u2019s most competitive industries. But these organizations are putting their competitive instincts aside to work collaboratively for social justice.\u201d The term social justice can be broadly defined as the degree of fairness or justice in the opportunities and access to resources, wealth, political representation, and privileges within a given society. In neighborhoods with high poverty rates, opportunities to play \u2013 a globally recognized fundamental human right of childhood \u2013 oftentimes do not exist, particularly for kids of color. Barriers include the elimination or reduction of enrichment of programs, budget challenges for afterschool programs including sports, safe passage to playgrounds, transportation, lack of trained and well-paid coaches and the rising costs of athletics and intramural programs. These factors severely limit access and opportunities for kids of color to build a pathway to lifelong wellbeing. The pro teams of the ALLIANCE: Los Angeles are united in their determination to combat this injustice. The ALLIANCE: Los Angeles and the Play Equity Fund will hold a Sports for Social Justice Symposium on July 22, to coincide with National Youth Sports Week, which is July 20-24. This webinar will include leaders from the sports organizations, as well as social justice leaders and sports commentators.

On one side are strip malls and housing developments, on the other side are fantasy-filled theme parks, and they\u2019re connected by Interstate 4, the asphalt spine that normally is clogged by folks escaping one for the other. Two different towns coexist out of proximity and convenience and even necessity, and it\u2019s been this way since a man and a cartoon mouse surveyed a vast stretch of cattle pasture six decades ago and had the insane imagination to build a global tourist attraction. And now, here in the midst of a pandemic, Orlando is separated once again. Another visionary \u2014 in this case, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \u2014 arrived here to create an insular safe space for the league on Disney World property; meanwhile, a coronavirus-whipped city must watch with its nose pressed against the glass. Everyone wants to know what\u2019s about to happen on the inside, and in due time, science will decide if this bold experiment to restart the NBA season will impress or implode. But what about the outside? How is the Other Half living? The state of Florida now grapples with a massive spike in COVID-19 cases and overwhelmed hospitals and could shut down again. It presents an interesting juxtaposition, how one part of Orlando is the center of hope, and the other part is the Florida epicenter of coronavirus devastation. As LeBron James seeks a championship with his third team, and the Milwaukee Bucks aim to stamp their legitimacy, and fractured Utah Jazz teammates Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert learn to get along, the Orlando that the team buses bypass on the way to Disney is trying to cope with real life issues. Florida reported 15,299 cases on Sunday, the highest one-day amount of new cases reported by any state since the pandemic began last spring, breaking its own record. There\u2019s also a surge in unemployment in Orlando and a reduction of children pulling their parents toward the park rides, a combination that, for a city heavily dependent on visitors, is more haunting than the summer humidity. While there will be no undocumented visitors or fans allowed inside the NBA\u2019s heavily secured campus, Orlando can at least live vicariously and virally through the players and a game that\u2019s so close yet so far away from the general population. Assuming, of course, that the season will continue hiccup-free through October\u2019s conclusion. If nothing else, the decamped NBA is a diversion for a place that could use one. \u201cThe whole country will watch what the NBA is doing, not just Orlando,\u201d said Pat Williams, the now-retired former president of the Orlando Magic. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine all that has gone into it, all the planning, all the details, all the health issues that had to be taken into account. First of all there\u2019s no blueprint for this. There\u2019s nothing in the NBA handbook about how to handle a pandemic and try to play basketball. And now we\u2019re going to see pro sports presented in a way that four months ago nobody could\u2019ve imagined in their wildest dreams, right here in a city where everyone\u2019s wearing a mask and looking like the Lone Ranger.\u201d The league is hardly doing this on a whim. This is months in the making. The NBA is bringing resources and vision and planning and certainly crossed fingers to the battleground with coronavirus. All players were tested before leaving their home cities, which is why Russell Westbrook, who tested positive for COVID-19, wasn\u2019t on the team plane and therefore won\u2019t turn up in Orlando to expose others until he clears, and why only two out of 322 players tested positive at Disney. But the way of life for Orlando beyond the basketball courts can only be classified as confusing. There is no consistent governmental or civic plan for opening businesses, schools, attractions and other gathering spots, and so this place is indeed open \u2014 to second-guessing. Was the state too quick to relax certain standards in the fight? Did it rush to reintroduce a sense of normalcy by reopening in early May? That\u2019s all up for debate; meanwhile, instead of progressing, Florida is now a hotspot, with troubling signs swirling all around the NBA campus. The Disney parks reopened in phases last weekend with an abundance of safety protocols and the reaction was mixed, with most of the outcries coming nationally through social media. But locally, at least among those who depend on the theme parks for a living, it was welcome. That\u2019s why the Orlando situation is a complicated bag. When the rent is due and jobs are at stake and the unemployment checks end, it gets personal and urgent. For example, Adrienne Johnston, bureau chief of workforce statistics and economic research at the Department of Economic Opportunity, recently gave a bleak outlook to a Central Florida job market that was at 2.9% unemployment before the theme parks closed in mid-March. By May, the jobless rate was 23.2% in Orange County, 31% in Osceola County. \u201c Based on the information that we see through both the labor force statistics and the job creation numbers, it\u2019s very apparent that leisure and hospitality is an area that is continuing to either see job losses or not gain them back quite as quickly,\u201d Johnston said. \u201c With the Orlando metro area, there\u2019s a high concentration of those types of jobs in that area. And so, they\u2019re more impacted more than other areas in the state.\u201d Just on the other side of I-4 from Amway Center, the downtown home of the Orlando Magic, lies the city\u2019s business district and a stretch of bars and restaurants on Church Street. None are busier on game nights than the popular Harry Buffalo, which has seen a steep drop in traffic. \u201cWhen the Magic had a home game we\u2019d close down the street, have block parties with bands and big gatherings with happy hour and tailgating,\u201d said Riece Davis, manager of Harry Buffalo. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously changed dramatically for us. It\u2019s been a struggle.\u201d Davis said his staff was trimmed from 50 to 10 and resorted to take-out meals just to save the business. He\u2019s happy the NBA decided to resume the season even if it\u2019s 10 miles away. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have live sports on again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t pack the house like we normally would before a Magic game but still have people if people want to get out of the house and wear a mask and sit six feet apart, they\u2019ll be here. People miss it and want it back.\u201d Nobody\u2019s more anxious for the NBA to resume than the NBA. Teams are practicing now, scrimmaging by next week and playing real games by month\u2019s end. The signs are promising so far at Disney. Meanwhile, the other half of Orlando watches and wonders. \u201cWhen we were awarded the basketball franchise, we named the team the Magic because we thought magic captured the spirit of the city,\u201d said Williams. \u201cSomehow, hopefully, we\u2019ll do what it takes to get through this. We don\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here  , find  his archive here    and follow him on  Twitter  .

We\u2019ll be ready to roll here in the next two or three weeks.\u201d The statuses of Harden and Luc Mbah a Moute remain unknown, and it\u2019s still not clear exactly where Westbrook is in the league\u2019s COVID-19 testing protocol. Per the NBA\u2019s protocol, Westbrook would be tested daily. When Westbrook produces two negative tests, he can join the team at Walt Disney World. Upon arrival, Westbrook would then need to undergo additional COVID-19 testing and an additional two-day self-quarantine. \u201c They\u2019re working out on their own, and they\u2019re gearing up ,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said.  \u201c When they get here, I think they\u2019ll be able to hit the court running, which will be huge. We\u2019ll be careful. \u201c But I know Russ personally. He has been so good about everything that we try to do, first with the film room, paying attention, asking good questions, speaking up in the locker room when he needs to. So he\u2019s been a great leader, a great teammate. That\u2019s all you can ask [for]. I know him. This is killing him not to be here. It\u2019s an obstacle that he has to overcome, and there\u2019s nobody better equipped to overcome it than him. \u201d The Rockets are preparing to participate in scrimmage games later in the week, and D\u2019Antoni addressed the media Monday following a light practice. Westbrook, the Kia MVP winner in 2016-17, is averaging 27.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game with Houston. The Rockets are 40-24 and the current No. 6 seed in the Western Conference . The Rockets open their NBA restart schedule on July 31 against the Dallas Mavericks.  * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

That would eclipse the previous high, 115, set by last season\u2019s Golden State Warriors. It would be hard to describe the Mavs as the best offense ever, because this has been the most efficient season in history league-wide. The Mavs have scored 5.8 more points per 100 possessions than the league average (109.9), making theirs just the 24th best offense (and just the fourth best Mavs offense) in the 24 seasons for which we have play-by-play data. The Mavs have still scored 2.4 more points per 100 possessions than the second-ranked Houston Rockets, a differential matched by only four top-ranked offenses \u2014 those of the 2006-07 Phoenix Suns (3.2 points per 100 possessions better than the second-ranked Mavs), the \u201909-10 Suns (3.0), the \u201904-05 Suns (2.4) and the \u201901-02 (Mavs) \u2014 of the last 24 years. All four of those offenses were built around the pick-and-roll playmaking of Steve Nash. These Mavs, of course, are built around Luka Doncic. Last season, Doncic had the highest usage rate for a rookie in these past 24 years, using 29.6% of the Mavs\u2019 possessions (via shots, turnovers or trips to the line) while he was on the floor. This season, he\u2019s seen the third biggest jump in usage rate (to 35.8%, third in the league ) among 266 players who have played at least 500 minutes both in \u201918-19 and \u201919-20. The Mavs don\u2019t run much. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Mavs have taken only 11.8% of their shots, the league\u2019s lowest rate, in the first six seconds of the shot clock. And while Doncic ranks 11th in the league at 12.5 points in the paint per game, the Mavs are a jump-shooting team. They\u2019ve taken 57% of their shots , the league\u2019s highest rate, from outside the paint. That means the most efficient offense in NBA history relies heavily on half-court execution and shots from the perimeter. And on the perimeter is often where all five Mavs will begin their half-court possessions. They stretch out the defense, aiming to keep the middle of the floor open for Doncic or his screeners, depending on what the defense gives them. It\u2019s definitely a pick-your-poison situation for opposing defenses, because the Mavs\u2019 pick-and-roll game is efficient in multiple ways. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Mavs rank in the top two in pick-and-roll ball-handler efficiency, roll-man efficiency, and spot-up efficiency. Doncic is one of the league\u2019s best playmakers and he\u2019s complemented by both top-ranked roll men and potent shooters. According to Synergy, the Mavs have scored 1.00 points per possession on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions, *the best ball-handler mark for any team in its 16 seasons of tracking play types. Doncic has accounted for 714 (47%) of Dallas\u2019 1,531 ball-handler possessions. * Five of the six best marks for ball-handler efficiency have come in the last two seasons, with last season\u2019s Warriors and Blazers being joined by this season\u2019s Mavs, Celtics and Blazers , as well as the \u201915-16 Warriors . Play 1. Maxi Kleber sets an early and high screen for Doncic, who puts Bam Adebayo on his heels and finishes in control. Number to know: Doncic ranks third in the league with 13.2 ball-handler possessions per game. The 1.04 points per possession he\u2019s scored as a ball-handler rank fifth among 49 players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. Play 2. On a baseline out-of-bounds play, Doncic takes a hand-off from Dorian Finney-Smith and uses a screen from Boban Marjanovic. He keeps Royce O\u2019Neale on his hip and sinks a floater over Rudy Gobert. Number to know: Doncic ranks ninth with 242 non-restricted-area shots in the paint. The 41.7% he\u2019s shot on those ranks 43rd among 95 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 3. Doncic flares to left side of the floor for another screen toward the middle, this one from Kleber. Derrick White goes under the screen and Doncic steps into a pull-up 3. Number to know: Doncic has attempted 7.3 pull-up 3-pointers per game, third most in the league . The 32.1% he\u2019s shot on pull-up 3-pointers ranks 44th among 60 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 4. Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis play a two-man game and Porzingis\u2019 final screen gets a switch from LaMarcus Aldridge, who falls victim to a hesitation move. Number to know: The Mavs have scored 117.0 points per 100 possessions with Doncic on the floor. That\u2019s the highest on-court mark for offensive efficiency among 265 players who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 40 games or more. Play 5. Zion Williamson switches an early screen from Kleber and Doncic goes to his step-back. Number to know: 236 (48%) of Doncic\u2019s 491 3-point attempts have been classified as step-backs . He\u2019s shot 34.7% on those step-back 3s and 29.0% from 3-point range otherwise. Play 6. This time, a \u201cpistol\u201d screen from Seth Curry gets Doncic switched into a smaller defender. He takes Frank Jackson into the post and to a short jump hook. Number to know: Doncic has been assisted on just 18.8% of his baskets, down from 27.1% last season and the fourth lowest rate among 164 players with at least 200 total field goals. Stopping Doncic on the pick-and-roll is priority No. 1 for opposing defenses. But the job is not done there, because Dallas ranks second in roll-man efficiency , with their roll men having scored 1.25 points per possession. (Roll-man possessions include pick-and-pop situations.) The Mavs lost a weapon when Dwight Powell tore his Achilles in January. Powell had shot 78.8% in the restricted area, the third-best mark among 204 players with at least 100 restricted-area attempts. But playing behind and alongside Powell, the Mavs still had Kleber and Porzingis, two bigs who not only finish well enough at the rim, but can also step out and shoot 3-pointers. Play 1. In transition, Donovan Mitchell shades Doncic in the direction of Porzingis\u2019 oncoming screen. So Doncic rejects the screen, draws the attention of Gobert, and quickly gets the ball back to Porzingis for a 3 from the top of the arc. Number to know: Porzingis\u2019 3.0 roll-man possessions per game rank 16th and his 1.20 points per possession scored on roll-man possessions rank 15th among 45 players who have averaged at least two per game. Play 2. The \u201cempty side\u201d pick-and-roll involving Doncic and Porzingis is one of the toughest to guard, because of the lack of help available on the back side. Here, Porzingis sets a screen for Doncic to attack the middle of the floor. Derrick Favors steps up and, with the right side of the floor otherwise empty, there\u2019s nobody to tag Porzingis on the roll to the rim. Number to know: The 7-foot-3 Porzingis has taken only 21% of his shots in the restricted area. That\u2019s the same as his rate through his first three seasons in the league, but is the 51st lowest rate among 229 players with at least 300 total field goal attempts. It was only a tick higher after Powell was lost for the season (20.7%) than it was prior (20.4%). Play 3. When Kleber rolls to the rim after handing off to Doncic, James Ennis is in position to tag the roll. But he fails to do so and Kleber finishes another alley-oop. Number to know: Kleber\u2019s 2.2 roll-man possessions per game rank 36th and his 1.40 points per possession scored on roll-man possessions rank fourth (just ahead of Powell\u2019s 1.35) among 45 players who have averaged at least two per game. Play 4. Rolls don\u2019t just come from on-ball screens. With Doncic off the floor, Kleber and Porzingis line up to set a double-pin-down screen for Tim Hardaway Jr. out of the left corner. But Hardaway pivots after using the first screen and screens Kleber\u2019s man (Williamson). Favors reacts and switches out to Kleber, allowing Porzingis to roll into the paint. Kleber gets him the ball for a short turnaround jumper over the recovering Williamson. Number to know: Porzingis has been assisted on 79.6% of his field goals, the highest rate of his career . Play 5. This is a fun first play of the game from the Mavs\u2019 March 10 loss in San Antonio. Doncic takes a hand-off from Finney-Smith into a pick-and-roll with Porzingis as Hardaway sets a back-screen for Finney-Smith. But those actions are just setting up Porzingis\u2019 cross-screen for Hardaway. With Bryn Forbes trailing Hardaway over the screen, Aldridge sinks into the paint, leaving Porzingis wide-open beyond the arc. Number to know: Porzingis has attempted 7.5 catch-and-shoot jumpers per game, second most in the league . His effective field goal percentage of 51.3% on catch-and-shoot jumpers ranks 69th among 83 players who have attempted at least 200. Defending both the ball-handler and the roll man would be easier if they weren\u2019t surrounded by guys who can knock down shots. The Mavs are one of two teams \u2014 New Orleans is the other \u2014 that rank in the top five in both catch-and-shoot attempts per game (29.1, third ) and catch-and-shoot effective field goal percentage (56.4%, fourth ). They rank second both in spot-up possessions per game (27.4) and spot-up efficiency (1.06 points per possession), according to Synergy. Play 1. The right side isn\u2019t empty when Porzingis sets an early screen for Doncic, which means that Bojan Bogdanovic is there to tag the roll. But when he does take a step toward Porzingis, Finney-Smith relocates for a catch-and-shoot 3 from the right wing. Number to know: Finney-Smith has taken 92% of his shots , the fifth-highest rate among 229 players with at least 300 total field goal attempts, from the restricted area (34%) or 3-point range (58%). Play 2. Bogdanovic switches the second half of a double-drag screen for Doncic, who resets and gets another screen from Finney-Smith, with Porzingis now acting as the off-ball spacer. Gobert stays in the paint to help on the roll and calls for Bogdanovic to switch out to Porzingis. That doesn\u2019t happen and Gobert doesn\u2019t recover back to his man in time. Number to know: Doncic ranks third with 215 assists on 3-pointers. Play 3. Doncic takes a hand-off from Porzingis with the right side empty again. As Hardaway is clearing out to the left corner, Brandon Ingram remains in the paint to help on the roll. Doncic looks him off and hits Hardaway for a corner 3. Number to know: Hardaway\u2019s 1.29 points per possession on spot-up possessions rank third among 99 players who have averaged at least three per game. He\u2019s seen the fourth-biggest jump in effective field goal percentage ( from 47.4% to 55.4% ) among 200 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. Play 4. The Spurs switch a Doncic\/Porzingis pick-and-roll and Doncic backs out to isolate against Rudy Gay. He doesn\u2019t really gain an advantage, but Finney-Smith does when he attacks DeMar DeRozan\u2019s close-out. That puts the Spurs in rotation and Doncic swings the ball to an open Curry in the left corner. Number to know: Curry\u2019s 1.36 points per possession on spot-up possessions rank first among 99 players who have averaged at least three per game. Play 5. Another Finney-Smith drive collapses the Heat zone and Curry is open on the left wing. Number to know: According to Synergy, the Mavs have seen 209 possessions of zone, eighth most in the league. The 1.09 points per possession they\u2019ve scored against zone ranks fourth among the 22 teams who have played at least 100 possessions against zone. The Mavs aren\u2019t like the Celtics , Jazz or Thunder , who all have multiple players who are dangerous off the dribble. Dallas\u2019 band of ball-handlers is obviously top-heavy. But the Mavs have other guys who are capable off the dribble, even though they\u2019re down a guard with Jalen Brunson recovering from shoulder surgery. Even with Doncic off the floor, they can create advantages by quickly running a second pick-and-roll on the weak side. Play 1. On a sideline out-of-bounds play, Curry runs a pick-and-roll with Porzingis from the left side and pitches to Doncic at the top right, with Finney-Smith ready to set another screen. O\u2019Neale is able to stay in front, but Doncic backs him down into the paint, draws a foul, and scores. Number to know: The Mavs have seen the league\u2019s third biggest drop in free throw rate (FTA\/FGA), from 0.291 ( fourth ) last season to 0.257 ( 16th ) this season. Play 2. Kleber sets the initial screen for Curry, who pitches to Delon Wright for the second-side pick-and-pop with Porzingis. Nicolo Melli switches that one and Wright beats him off the dribble. Williamson helps off Kleber, who drains the corner 3 with Curry also wide-open on the wing (though Josh Hart isn\u2019t guarding anybody). Number to know  : Kleber leads the league with 239 wide-open 3-point attempts. The 38.9% he\u2019s shot on wide-open 3s ranks 77th among 126 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 3. Here are the same guys in the same roles. The Jazz don\u2019t switch the screen, but Gobert sinks off Kleber to tag Porzingis on the roll. Wright skips the ball to Kleber, who swings it to Curry when Mitchell rotates down. Number to know: Curry ranks second in 3-point percentage at 45.3%. There are times when the floor isn\u2019t completely spread for the Doncic pick-and-roll. Most of the league runs a \u201cstack\u201d or \u201cSpain\u201d pick-and-roll, where a third player starts in the paint and sets a second screen (from the back) on the guy defending the initial screener. But the Mavs run it the most, and most often with Curry as the second screener. Play 1. Kleber sets the initial screen, Gobert stays attached to his man and Jordan Clarkson stays attached to Curry, leaving a driving lane wide open for Doncic. Number to know: Doncic has shot 72.8% in the restricted area, up from 62.0% last season and the sixth best mark among 33 players with at least 300 restricted-area attempts. Play 2. A few possessions later, the Mavs run it again. This time, Mike Conley (guarding Curry) picks up Doncic and calls for Clarkson to switch out to Curry. But Doncic gets to his spin move and drains a short floater over Conley. Number to know: Doncic is the league\u2019s leading first-quarter scorer at 9.3 points per game. Play 3. Later in the same period, Hardaway is the second screener, but doesn\u2019t make contact with Tony Bradley, who picks up Doncic. The Jazz appear to be in good shape, but when O\u2019Neale recovers to the ball, Kleber has an open path to the rim and Doncic hits him with a wraparound pass. Number to know: Kleber has been assisted on 91.1% of his baskets , the fourth highest rate among 164 players with at least 200 total field goals. Play 4. In the third quarter of the same game, Doncic goes back and forth before gaining an advantage with the high screen from Marjanovic. When Curry sets the back-screen on Gobert, Clarkson has to be the one who stops the ball. With O\u2019Neale still trailing Doncic, Curry is open when he pops out to a 3. Number to know: Curry has an effective field goal percentage of 72.1% on catch-and-shoot jumpers, the best mark among 83 players who have attempted at least 200. Hardaway has the 10th best mark (63.7%). Play 5. Yogi Ferrell knows what\u2019s coming and slides over to help on Doncic\u2019s drive, but Curry slips out to the weak side early and Kent Bazemore (initially guarding Doncic) doesn\u2019t have time to get there. Number to know: The Mavs have the league\u2019s biggest differential between their field goal percentage (46.2%, 13th ) and their effective field goal percentage (54.8%, fifth ). The Mavs rank just 17th on defense , having allowed 110.0 points per 100 possessions. But with such a huge difference between their offense and everybody else, their point differential per 100 (+5.8) ranks sixth in the league and third in the Western Conference , with a big gap between them and the fourth-ranked Rockets (+3.4). So how are they in seventh place ? Because they\u2019re just 14-21 (worse than the Knicks) in games that have been within five points in the last five minutes. Amazingly, their offense has disappointed down the stretch of close games. While they have the most efficient offense in NBA history, the Mavs rank 29th in clutch offense , having scored a paltry 93.9 points per 100 possessions with the score within five in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. Hardaway (37.9%), Doncic (36.9%) and Porzingis (32.5%) account for 138 (62%) of the Mavs 223 clutch field goal attempts, and they rank 64th, 67th and 70th in clutch effective field goal percentage among the 71 players who have attempted at least 25 clutch shots. In late-game situations, defenses are more likely to switch screens. Doing so closes some of the openings that the Mavs\u2019 pick-and-roll game usually creates. A team that relies on jump shots will have a tougher time when those jump shots are more tightly guarded. Of course, the Mavs have scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions in both of their games against the Houston Rockets, who switch screens all the time . The Mavs are the only team that has taken more than half of their clutch shots (51.6%) from 3-point range, and they rank last in clutch 3-point percentage (22.6%). Doncic has shot just 6-for-35 (17%) on clutch 3-pointers, the third worst mark among 40 players who have attempted at least 20 . Most of those 35 attempts ( watch them all here ) have been well-defended step-backs. Only three, including one of the six makes (where he was the second screener on a \u201cstack\u201d pick-and-roll and popped out to the right wing), have been directly off the catch. Doncic is 0-for-9 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, with eight of those nine attempts having come from beyond the arc. It would help if he could get to the basket more in those situations. But there\u2019s also just some bad luck in the Mavs\u2019 clutch numbers. While they rank 15th in overall free throw percentage (77.3%), they rank 28th in clutch free throw percentage (70.5%). Their point differential says they\u2019re a better team than their record would indicate. Maybe they\u2019ll have better luck in clutch situations in Orlando, or maybe over-reliance on half-court execution is a bad thing when you haven\u2019t played in four months. There are a lot of things to keep a close eye on when games resume, not the least of which is the effects of the hiatus on the most efficient offense in NBA history. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t get near the reptile even if I wanted to (confession: I don\u2019t), because starting yesterday through 11:59 pm next Sunday, I\u2019m in quarantine, unable to leave the room unless the fire alarm goes off. And even then, there\u2019d better be smoke. The NBA isn\u2019t fooling around with this restart or any chances of coronavirus sneaking into the campus. The league is playing a level of leak-proof lockdown defense that has Kawhi Leonard taking notes. It\u2019s reassuring, no doubt, how every precaution is being taken to protect staff, players, coaches and anyone else invited to the Disney lab during this pandemic, even a select handful of reporters, which means somebody does care about us after all. Here\u2019s how the check-in went: Upon arrival, and once you get past two security guards who don\u2019t smile, you\u2019re led straight to the ballroom, given an electronic wristband that magically opens your hotel room door, escorted to that room, and ordered to stay inside until 2021. Well, not quite, but it\u2019ll seem that way by Wednesday. My TV remote control needed batteries, and a technician knocked on the door. When I opened it, he stood 10 feet away. Two more steps backward and that gator had a snack. The tech refused to enter the room until I left. Again: This might be one of the few places in Florida, which had a record day in cases Sunday, taking this virus seriously. Wait, there\u2019s another knock: It\u2019s COVID-19 testing time. The tester, wearing a hazmat suit, sticks one swab down my throat and another through both nostrils. She says, reassuringly: \u201cI won\u2019t go all the way up your nose\u201d which makes me, ahem, breathe easy. Thank goodness there was no finger prick; that\u2019s the worst. The next test will be after quarantine. During my time on campus, tests and temperature will be taken regularly. If I test positive, I\u2019ll be back home cutting the grass. The accommodations are fine. The room is 12 by 18 feet with two beds, a small fridge and enough floorspace to do pushups, jumping jacks and maybe four lunges. The AC unit makes July in Orlando seem like January in Juneau. It\u2019s not the Ritz but I once stayed in a roadside motel in Morgan City, La., (long story) and nothing compares to that. Oh, there\u2019s another knock at the door: Dinner. A few players have taken to social media to talk about the food, which is actually tasty, but it\u2019s all relative. The players live a first-class lifestyle and have long progressed to lobster and champagne and are beyond those among us still hoping for steak on a burger budget. Whenever I\u2019ve forgotten where I came from, my taste buds gently remind me about having to eat mustard sandwiches (long ago story). So this is the new life, separated from family and friends, preparing for a week on lockdown, followed by months of unlocking the remaining mysteries of the 2019-20 interrupted NBA season, starting with: Does LeBron James win a third title with a third team? I\u2019ve been doing this job for a minute and it has taken me to Greece, Tokyo, Australia, Scotland, Paris, South Africa, London and Morgan City, among other intriguing places, on assignment. This is a new one. Which means: If you\u2019re lucky to stay in this business long enough, someday you\u2019ll eventually report on a sport that had to force quit for over three months, lose many millions of dollars, huddle with scientists, carve out a protective campus on the Disney property, lean on the guts and conviction of a great commissioner, gather 22 teams together and continue the season . Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, you now get to see four walls, and nothing more, for one week. And there\u2019s no other place you\u2019d rather be. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

The Lakers subsequently announced Rondo had fractured his right thumb and is expected to miss 6-8 weeks following surgery, which will take place later in the week. Rondo has been a key backup during his second season with the Lakers, who signed him shortly after adding LeBron James to the roster in July 2018. James typically functions as the Lakers\u2019 point guard with the starting unit, but Rondo frequently took on the role while James rested or while both veterans were on the floor together. Rondo is averaging 7.1 points, 5.0 assists and 3.0 rebounds in 48 appearances this season, including three starts. He has been a regular presence on the floor late in close games, with coach Frank Vogel trusting his veteran leadership and playmaking. In a Monday video conference call, Vogel expressed confidence Rondo would return to serve as a \u201cmajor factor\u201d during the playoffs: \u201cWhat we have to understand about Rajon, losing Rajon is a huge loss for our team, but we expect Rajon to be a part of our playoff run.\u201d Rondo is seeking his second NBA championship after winning with Boston in 2008, but he has a lengthy history of hand injuries. He broke his right thumb during the playoffs with the Chicago Bulls in 2017, and was sidelined for a month with a broken bone in his right hand last season. He also broke his left hand in 2014. Rondo should be able to return if the Lakers advance deep into the NBA playoffs in Orlando, but his injury adds to the Western Conference leaders\u2019 depth concerns. Los Angeles already is without starting guard Avery Bradley, who declined to participate in the league\u2019s restart after a long hiatus due to the coronavirus. Alex Caruso and Quinn Cook are likely to get more playing time at point guard in Rondo\u2019s absence. Dwight Howard and Danny Green were in practice with the Lakers on Sunday night after coronavirus testing glitches forced them to miss Saturday\u2019s workout, Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s never a good sign when some of your players get hurt \u2014 especially one of your leaders,\u201d Green said Monday . \u201cWe need him to come off the bench and give us a little spark. But I know he\u2019ll be on the sideline for us, coaching his ass off, teaching us and letting the young guys know \u2026 what he sees and what adjustments we need to make.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":27068,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-wear-own-name-jersey-restart","date":"2020-07-13","title":"Anthony Davis to wear own name on jersey for restart","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Anthony Davis will wear his own name on the back of his jersey when the Los Angeles Lakers return to action. Davis confirmed his decision Sunday in a conference call from Orlando, where the Western Conference-leading Lakers are beginning team workouts. Davis and LeBron James both declined to choose a social justice message to replace their names on the back of their jerseys during the NBA restart. Davis, a seven-time NBA All-Star, said he was \u201ctorn between\u201d choosing from among the 29 approved messages and sticking with his name. \u201cFor me, I think the name \u2018Davis\u2019 is something I try to represent every time I step on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think my last name is something that\u2019s very important to me, and also social justice as well. But (I\u2019m) just holding my family name and representing the name on the back to go through this process \u2026 and people who have been with me through my entire career to help me get to this point, while still kind of bringing up things that we can do for social injustice.\u201d James said he decided to forgo a social justice message because the available options didn\u2019t \u201cresonate\u201d for him or his particular feelings about the movement. James would have liked to choose his own slogan, but wasn\u2019t angry that it wasn\u2019t allowed. Both James and Davis have been outspoken about social justice causes in the past, although the younger Davis is less vocal than James. The Lakers open play in Orlando on July 30 against the Clippers."},{"id":27077,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-season-restart-challenge-team-equipment-managers","date":"2020-07-12","title":"At the NBA restart, team equipment is a challenge to manage","content":" LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Rob Pimental spent a good amount of time thinking about everything the Miami Heat would need for what could be a three-month trip to Walt Disney World. He is the Heat equipment manager. Every jersey, sock, sneaker, whatever the team needs, it\u2019s his responsibility to have it ready. So, when it came time to figure out what was getting packed for Disney, Pimental came to a realization. \u201cPretty much everything,\u201d said Pimental, who confessed to having a few sleepless nights of worrying. \u201cI\u2019m the type of guy who wants everything on hand, so I literally packed up my entire equipment room and brought it with me.\u201d He\u2019s not alone. All 22 teams in the NBA restart had to pack more than ever, for a road trip like none other. Every team is assured of spending at least five weeks at Disney, and some could be there for three months. The challenges for players and coaches are obvious, but the challenge for equipment managers \u2014 among the unsung heroes of this restart plan \u2014 aren\u2019t anywhere near as visible to those watching games from afar. \u201cThis is what equipment managers were built for, honestly,\u201d Orlando Magic equipment manager Jacob Diamond said. \u201cWe have some of the smartest guys around the league that do what I do and at the end of the day, for us, it\u2019s really no job too big, no job too small. Our coaches are relying on us, our players, and this is history right here. So, it\u2019s kind of cool to be a part of it \u2014 even though it\u2019s extra work.\u201d For this trip, Diamond has a two-room suite in the hotel that the Magic are calling home. It\u2019s not a perk. He needed the space. Luggage is lined up around all four walls, with more bags in the middle of the room, along with a clothes rack, a large trunk and a bunch of bright blue bags with the Magic logo stacked over by the sliding door that leads to the balcony. He knows the contents of each, where every item is, so if Nikola Vucevic needs a certain pair of socks or Aaron Gordon needs a certain type of compression gear, Diamond finds it in a flash. \u201cI made sure I overpacked for this rather than underpacked,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to have things sent here. I\u2019d rather have things here, ready to go, so here we are.\u201d Toronto Raptors equipment manager Paul Elliott prides himself on typically taking only what he needs. He tends to take 45 bags on a standard road trip; by NBA standards, that is packing light. Not this time. For this trip, Elliott\u2019s count was 176 bags. And while most teams only had to move their operation once \u2014 from their home facility to Disney \u2014 Elliott had to pack the Raptors up twice, first from Toronto to their pre-camp workouts at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, and then again to get the stuff up to Disney. \u201cI looked at it as what they were going to take for a two-week Western road trip, took what I would usually pack for that, and kind of quadrupled it,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI just had to make sure I had enough options for these guys to accommodate them when they need. I just want to be prepared.\u201d More gear is on the way. By the time games start, the 22 teams will have more than 4,000 jerseys between them. Every team brought three sets of uniforms \u2014 typically, two jerseys each for each player. Then the decision was made to give players at Disney the opportunity to wear jerseys with a message raising awareness about social injustice and racial inequality, and those huge shipments are expected to arrive in the next few days. When Elliott started unloading the Raptors\u2019 176 bags, several staff members who aren\u2019t usually tasked with helping with equipment ran to his aid. More bags will be going back to Toronto when the season ends; Elliott had his assistant send him empty ones to accommodate the new jerseys. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the greatest staff for that sort of thing,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cNobody\u2019s above anything. They just want to make sure it\u2019s done properly.\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said the Wizards are using a similar everybody-must-help approach, and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra insisted his team do the same. \u201cThere\u2019s an absolute understanding that this is an all-hands-on-deck situation,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd that means bags, laundry, cleanup, everything \u2014 not just for equipment managers, but everybody. \u2026 We\u2019re all going to be involved in every aspect of it.\u201d Days will be long for equipment managers. Each team only sent one; it\u2019s not unusual for two equipment personnel to travel, but that wasn\u2019t possible on this trip because of the restrictions on the amount of people who can be in the NBA bubble. Extra work will add up as well. After practices or games, equipment managers will have to load up the sweaty gear, take it back to the hotel, then call a shuttle to pick them up and take them to the laundry facility built for the restart \u2014 66 washers and 66 dryers, all lined up inside what once was a batting cage at the Atlanta Braves\u2019 former spring training complex. There\u2019s also a code among the equipment managers. While the 22 teams will be trying to beat each other, the equipment staffs are working together and helping one another where possible. \u201cWe all understand each other\u2019s daily battles,\u201d Diamond said, \u201cbecause we share the same ones.\u201d The real comforts of home are gone for the next several weeks. The trick, Pimental said, is making sure players don\u2019t have to worry about getting what they need. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve never done before,\u201d Pimental said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll make it work.\u201d"},{"id":27049,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-leonard-joins-clippers","date":"2020-07-12","title":"Kawhi Leonard joins LA Clippers in Florida","content":" LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has rejoined the team in Orlando to prepare for the restart of the 2019-20 season, coach Doc Rivers confirmed on Saturday. \u201cKawhi, he is here, he is going through the protocol,\u201d Rivers said. Leonard did not travel with the team on Wednesday due to a family matter. The Clippers held their first practice at the Walt Disney World Resort on Friday. They will resume their season on July 30, matching up with the Los Angeles Lakers in the second game of a re-opening night doubleheader. Leonard is averaging a team-best 26.9 points this season for the Clippers, who are currently second in the Western Conference behind only the Lakers. He is the reigning NBA Finals MVP, after helping Toronto win the title last season. The Clippers are 38-13 when Leonard plays, 6-7 when he doesn\u2019t.

But with the state of Texas registering yet another single-day record Saturday for new cases with more than 10,000, Popovich figures the NBA\u2019s bubble is as safe a place to hole up as any. \u201cBeing 71 years old, I thought, \u2018Is this where I want to spend a lot of my time, doing this, under these circumstances?\u2019\u201d Popovich said Saturday during a Zoom call from Lake Buena Vista, Florida. \u201cDo I really want to do this? Is it safe? But I talked to a lot of people. I talked to [NBA commissioner] Adam [Silver]. \u201cYou find out pretty quickly what he and his staff of many have gone through to put this thing together. It\u2019s not just being a loyal soldier in the NBA. But I don\u2019t know where else you would be as safe as we are right now. From an intellectual point of a view and a medical point of view, I would have to say I am safer here, if this bubble works. \u201cI\u2019m safer here than I would be in Texas for sure as you see what\u2019s going on there.\u201d Besides that, Popovich sees something more significant than basketball at play here. When the league tips off again on July 30, the Spurs \u2014 ranked 12th in the Western Conference \u2013 face an uphill climb to advance to what would be an NBA-record 23rd consecutive postseason appearance. Perhaps a goal accompanied by even longer odds is Popovich\u2019s hope that the NBA can serve as a catalyst for maintaining the momentum already built around the country toward advancing causes championing social justice and racial inequality amidst the backdrop of a worldwide pandemic. \u201cAs we all are well aware, it\u2019s a seminal moment in the sense that we have an opportunity to do something transformative if we have the courage,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAnd as with many things in today\u2019s world, interest wanes pretty quickly, no matter what the topic. In this particular situation, talking about racism, it\u2019s been talked about many, many times over centuries. And this is where we are. \u201cSo, the league, the players, the coaches, the staff is very committed to keeping it up front in everybody\u2019s consciousness. Even though everybody\u2019s excited to go play, this is a great opportunity that we maintain the momentum because that\u2019s what it takes. It was the same way with voting rights, which of course are now in danger, and the LGBT movement. No matter what progress has been made, it\u2019s always been because of pressure. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen because people just said, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re gonna do this.\u2019 People, governments and politicians were forced into doing things.\u201d If you\u2019ve spent any amount of time around Popovich, you\u2019ve heard him say on numerous occasions that \u201cit\u2019s just basketball,\u201d while making sure to point out there are more important pursuits in life. For Popovich, the NBA\u2019s current mission is one of them. That\u2019s why during the NBA\u2019s hiatus, Popovich didn\u2019t watch a single second of game film or search for methods to mitigate the loss of San Antonio\u2019s second-leading scorer, LaMarcus Aldridge, who won\u2019t play at Walt Disney World after undergoing June surgery on his right shoulder. \u201cAs far as basketball is concerned, I did nothing,\u201d he admitted. Instead, Popovich spent time around family, while \u201creading, thinking about where we are, looking at our country, [and] figuring out where we might go as a country.\u201d Clearly, the condition of this country and the world at large concern Popovich more than X\u2019s and O\u2019s and pick-and-rolls. As the NBA\u2019s longest-tenured head coach, he\u2019s made a point throughout his time in San Antonio of toiling \u2013 whether through guests speaking with the team, book exchanges, screenings of films and various visits to historical sites \u2014 to educate players, coaches and staffers on worldly issues, as a foundational component to building the franchise\u2019s organizational culture of family, accountability, and empathy. At 71, Popovich understands that according to the Centers for Disease Control, he\u2019s more at risk to developing complications if he contracts the coronavirus. Anyone 65 and older is more susceptible, but that\u2019s not stopping Popovich and other head coaches around the NBA such as Mike D\u2019Antoni (69) and Alvin Gentry (65). \u201cSince the decision was made to do this, to start the season again under these circumstances with all the precautions, what a great opportunity to make race an upfront, basically, most important activity that happens on a social level while we\u2019re here,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cPeople will enjoy the games and the athleticism, the losses, the wins and the excitement. \u201cBut the message that the league wants to send is one of equity, no injustice for anyone and making sure people have to think about it every day, whether it\u2019s the coaches or a player speaking up. It\u2019s the momentum that we have to keep, and the league can be a great communicator for that. The coaches, the players, the league are all ready to do that, and I\u2019m very proud with them all for it.\u201d Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The Los Angeles Lakers superstar won\u2019t wear one of the NBA-approved social justice messages on the back of his jersey when the NBA resumes competition later this month in the Orlando bubble. \u201cIt was no disrespect to the list that was handed down to all the players,\u201d James said Saturday in a confernece call from Florida. \u201cI commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It\u2019s just something that didn\u2019t seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal.\u201d As part of the NBA\u2019s recognition of the nationwide invigoration of the social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd, NBA players are allowed to choose from a lengthy list of possible messages for their jerseys during the league\u2019s restart. James is among just a few who declined to choose one of the messages, he said. \u201cI would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on the back of my jersey,\u201d James said. \u201cI had a couple of things in mind, but I wasn\u2019t part of that process, which is OK. \u2026 Everything that I do has a purpose, has a meaning.

James speaks frequently of what he feels is a responsibility to campaign for positive social change from his powerful position in sports and pop culture. \u201cThis is the mission I\u2019ve been on for a long time now,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that a lot of people\u2019s ears are opening. A lot of people are understanding, a lot of people are recognizing. A lot of people still don\u2019t get it, and a lot of people are still afraid to talk about the racism that goes on in America, especially for our people. \u2026 But we have some ears, and we will continue to push the envelope and let everyone know that we are human as well. We don\u2019t want to be just be used for our God-given abilities.\u201d JaVale McGee, the Lakers\u2019 veteran center, said he will wear \u201cRespect Us\u201d on his jersey in Orlando. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to have this platform,\u201d said McGee, whose asthma has him being particularly cautious during the pandemic. \u201cWe have way more of a voice playing basketball. \u2026 Our fans are basketball fans over anything. This is the biggest platform we can speak about social injustices. That\u2019s the best time to talk about it.\u201d James also said he didn\u2019t consider not playing in the NBA\u2019s restart, believing the league can be a positive force through its visibility and competition.

After the Pistons relocated in 2017 to downtown Detroit, the arena about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of the city continued to host concerts and music events, the last in September 2017 by rocker Bob Seger. It also became the second suburban Detroit arena that found little real use after its main sports tenant took its games back to the city.

None of them, however, made it to the Orlando, Florida area with their usual travel party. Leaving families behind for several weeks \u2014 or maybe even three months, depending on how deep a team goes in the playoffs \u2014 during a pandemic isn\u2019t the only hardship that teams are dealing with during this restart. Space limitations within the quasi-bubble at Disney also meant that teams had to cut their official traveling parties down to 37 personnel, including players, so many people who usually travel with a club aren\u2019t on this trip. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to take everybody \u2014 and that stinks, because of the amount of work that they all put in every single day,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to identify how to be the most efficient we can be with people that can be excellent remotely as well. I think that that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019ve had to identify. In some cases, their excellence remotely probably hurt their chances of going initially.\u201d It\u2019s expected that as the bubble population shrinks after six teams are eliminated from playoff contention and then eight more are ousted in the first postseason round, teams will be allowed to bring in more staff. But until then, while teams are playing games on-site at Disney, there will be plenty of work done back in home markets and home arenas as well. Some teams left player development coaches behind, some even left assistant coaches, and all teams traveled with only one media relations staffer and one equipment manager. In normal circumstances, some teams travel with as many as three people to handle media requirements and two for equipment. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Orlando President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman said. \u201cWe kind of shied away from some of the language that was being thrown around \u2014 the whole idea of essential (staff) and non-essential (staff). It\u2019s not about that. This is a very narrowly defined circumstance, and it requires certain skill sets to address this circumstance.\u201d Players counted against the list of 37, and most teams brought the full complement of 17 players. That left 20 spots for coaches, assistant coaches, player development, video, security, strength and conditioning, athletic training, media relations and content creators. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the process of figuring out who goes and who doesn\u2019t was brutal. \u201cWe already have had a model of everybody sharing responsibilities,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe already had a meeting about this where there\u2019s an absolute understanding that this is an \u2018all hands on deck\u2019 situation. And that means bags, laundry, cleanup, everything \u2026 that\u2019s not just for equipment managers, that\u2019s everybody \u2014 coaches, trainers, weight room staff, head coach, coaches, we\u2019re all going to be involved in every aspect of it.\u201d Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan also expressed disappointment that tough decisions had to be made on the staffing end. He completely understands the NBA perspective. Keeping the number of people in the bubble manageable is a key part of the NBA\u2019s plan for being able to finish the season; the more people in the bubble, the more risk there is of something going wrong. \u201cEverybody deserves the opportunity, but for the safety of the league and the players we can\u2019t do that,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cSo, what we\u2019ve got to do is understand, whether it\u2019s myself or assistant coaches, we may have to be setting up video equipment, we may have to have one of our coaches filming practice in Orlando. There\u2019s things that we\u2019re going to have to do that are going to be outside the box that will normally been taken care of.\u201d NOTES: There were 14 teams scheduled for practice Friday.

The school announced the hiring in a social media post Saturday, a little more than a week after Joanne P. McCallie announced she wouldn\u2019t return for a 14th season as she entered the final year of her contract. It is the first college head-coaching job for the 39-year-old Lawson, who played under Pat Summitt at Tennessee before a long WNBA career as well as work in broadcasting. In a statement, Lawson called it \u201ca dream come true\u201d for someone who \u201cwanted to be a coach since I was a kid.\u201d \u201cEverybody I spoke with and had a chance to interact with, I immediately felt a great connection,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a decision based on emotion, but there was a lot of emotion involved in it because of how excited I am and how ready I am to get started and to work with the players.\u201d Lawson appeared in three Final Fours at Tennessee and then played in the WNBA from 2003-15, winning the 2005 championship with Sacramento. She also was part of the U.S. Olympic team that won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008. She had also worked as a TV commentator for NBA and college basketball games before the Celtics hired her in June 2019. Additionally, she has assisted USA Basketball efforts to prepare 3-on-3 teams for the Tokyo Olympics. In statements, athletics director Kevin White called Lawson \u201cthe ideal fit\u201d while university president Vincent Price said Lawson \u201chas proven herself as a skilled coach and a committed mentor.\u201d Duke is the second Atlantic Coast Conference program this offseason to hire a woman working as an NBA assistant to be its head coach. Notre Dame hired Memphis Grizzlies assistant Niele Ivey \u2013 a former Fighting Irish player and assistant \u2013 to replace Hall of Famer Muffet McGraw in April. Lawson inherits a Duke program that regularly goes to the NCAA Tournament, yet hasn\u2019t won a league title since the ACC added national powers Notre Dame (2013) and Louisville (2014) to what was already a top-flight conference. McCallie led Duke to at least a share of the regular-season title four times and three ACC Tournament titles while also making 10 trips to the NCAA Tournament, including four straight trips to the Elite Eight from 2010-13. But the Blue Devils have failed to finish in the top three of the league regular-season race in four of the past seven years since the last wave of league expansion. It\u2019ll be up to Lawson to shake things up and give the Duke program a jolt."},{"id":27158,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nuggets-await-nikola-jokic-orlando","date":"2020-07-10","title":"Nuggets await on Nikola Jokic's arrival in Orlando","content":" Update: Nikola Jokic has arrived in Orlando The wait continues for Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic to join his team at the Disney campus for the NBA\u2019s season restart. Nuggets coach Michael Malone said during a Zoom call with reporters Friday that the All-Star still hasn\u2019t joined the team since its arrival Tuesday at Walt Disney World. \u201cAs far as Nikola, the hope is he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him many times. I know he\u2019s excited and looking forward to getting down here. He\u2019s healthy, he feels great, and hopefully, he\u2019ll be here soon in the next couple of days.\u201d Malone declined to discuss specifics, but he mentioned Jokic wasn\u2019t the only member missing from Denver\u2019s traveling party. It\u2019s worth noting the Nuggets closed their practice facility at the end of June after two members of the team\u2019s traveling party tested positive for the coronavirus. A third tested positive the following week. Malone pointed out the situation \u201cset us back a little bit\u201d in preparation to travel to Orlando. The Nuggets completed their first practice since Mar. 11 on Friday. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest. We don\u2019t have our whole team here right now, and we\u2019re not gonna get in[to] any details on that,\u201d Malone said. \u201cBut we\u2019re waiting on some of our players to get down here. With the players that we have, we\u2019re treating it as an opportunity to get back in the gym to reconnect on the court, to get some conditioning in, to get some competitive drills in and kind of revisiting offensive and defensive fundamentals, and foundational parts of our team. \u201cBut this is not like going to day one of practice down in Colorado Springs last year. It\u2019s a little bit different. This whole thing is different in that regard. That\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it. But so far, I think the guys that are here, the commitment, the buy-in, the energy, the excitement, has been terrific. And we hope that will continue moving forward.\u201d Jokic tested positive for the coronavirus in late June while in Serbia, according to reports from ESPN and The Denver Post . The Nuggets\u2019 All-Star center later produced two negative retests while in Serbia, and league protocol required him to produce an additional two negative tests in the United States before he could join the team in Orlando. Nuggets power forward Paul Millsap said he had been in contact with Jokic on team Zoom calls over the past three weeks. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve heard from him,\u201d Millsap said. \u201c[It] seems like he\u2019s doing well. But as of now, I don\u2019t know his status or [have] any insight for you.\u201d Members of Denver\u2019s 35-person traveling party composed of players, coaches and staff, who hadn\u2019t tested negative for COVID-19 in the two days prior to the team\u2019s flight on Tuesday, are expected to join the squad in Orlando once they meet the NBA\u2019s requirements for two negative coronavirus tests. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge because you\u2019re limited on how many bodies you have, who you have, how many bigs, how many smalls that you have,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re not using as an excuse. The guys that are here are here. We\u2019re going to find a way as a coaching staff every day to put them in the best position to make sure we\u2019re getting meaningful, productive work in. And we\u2019ve done that the last couple of days. I think the conditioning is in a pretty good place. Are we in game shape today? I would say probably not. I can\u2019t imagine most of the teams down here are. We have ample opportunity and time to get ready for that.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The official tip comes July 30 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort. Who shows up in game shape and ready to go from the start? How will basketball\u2019s biggest stars respond in this unprecedented environment? And which group has the energy and stamina to survive basketball\u2019s greatest reality show? All 22 teams involved have to find the answers quickly, each playing just eight seeding games to finish off the regular season before the postseason begins. But there are some certainties involved in the process. There\u2019s a pecking order for the stars gathering in Orlando, whether anyone cares to admit it. All things aren\u2019t equal when it comes to star power. Some stars shine brighter than others in this constellation of the NBA\u2019s best. And in an effort to refresh the order for the restart, these are the 22 best players primed to compete in the bubble: * * * Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant will walk away from this season with Kia Rookie of the Year honors, and deservedly so. And he\u2019ll no doubt be one of the best and most talented players inside the bubble. But Zion\u2019s 19-game preview before the shutdown is proof that he\u2019s on the fast track to being one of the most physically difficult matchups to encounter in the NBA. If the physical transformation that took shape during the pandemic is any indication, he\u2019s in some of the best shape of his young life. (Williamson just turned 20.) The Pelicans have all the motivation to go all out in the bubble and Zion will lead the charge when he returns to the campus . Number to know: Williamson has averaged 20.9 points in the paint per 36 minutes , the highest rate for any player (minimum 500 minutes played) in the 24 seasons for which points in the paint have been tracked. Lowry didn\u2019t succumb to the dreaded complacency bug that often accompanies a championship run late in a veteran\u2019s career. If anything, Lowry is getting better with age. The Raptors didn\u2019t miss a beat with Kawhi Leonard defecting to the LA Clippers via free agency, and that was due in large part to Lowry\u2019s stepping up to help fill that void. He\u2019s shooting 35.4% on 3-pointers this season and dialed his numbers up across the board, leading in words and deeds for the reigning champs. Number to know: Lowry is tied for the league lead with 30 drawn charges. Folks clamoring to see how Booker performs in meaningful games with the Suns will get their wish, even though the Suns are the longest of long shots in the Western Conference playoff chase. Just getting the opportunity to perform and compete in this environment should provide valuable experience for both Booker and Deandre Ayton as the Suns try to craft a playoff contender around its two young stars. Booker has already shown himself to be a truly elite scorer, now we\u2019ll find out if he has the rest of his game leveled up. Number to know: Booker has 20.3 assists for every 100 passes made, the highest rate among 285 players who have made at least 750 passes. Is there a player in the bubble under more pressure than Middleton? As the No. 2 player on the best team (check the standings) with a time-sensitive component (decision time is near for Giannis Antetokounmpo), the All-Star forward is in the unique position of needing to play the best basketball of his career. Middleton has the skills required. But does he have the make up to deliver under such pressure conditions? Is he built for this moment? The answers could make the Bucks\u2019 season and future. Number to know: Middleton has shot 52.3% from mid-range, the second best mark among 79 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts. Don\u2019t let the fact that Gobert is the NBA\u2019s patient zero for COVID-19 distract from routine business he does as the league\u2019s premier rim protector and post defender. Gobert\u2019s ability to change the game as the backbone of Utah\u2019s defensive framework will make or break its bubble experience. If he\u2019s back to normal after the long layoff, the Jazz will have the chance to compete with the best of the best in the Western Conference. If he\u2019s anything less, an already challenging proposition (the Jazz will be without Bojan Bogdanovic, who is out after wrist surgery) becomes near impossible.The two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year is that indispensable in coach Quin Snyder\u2019s system. Number to know: Among 137 players with at least 500 field goal attempts, Gobert has the highest effective field goal percentage (69.8%), true shooting percentage (70.0%) and free throw rate (72.5 attempts per 100 shots from the field). The talent is undeniable. Simmons is a physical freak with his size at his position. But the back injury that slowed him down before the shutdown has left lingering questions about just how healthy he will be when reporting in Florida. Brett Brown said he\u2019ll \u201cease\u201d Simmons back into action, which is probably the wisest course of action. The Sixers need Simmons on the fast track, though, given how little time there is between the seeding games and the playoffs. Number to know: Simmons leads the league with 221 assists on 3-pointers, 49% of the 452 3s his teammates have made while he\u2019s been on the floor. Siakam punctuated his steady rise up the ranks this season with his first All-Star nod. His next-level work in the Raptors\u2019 championship run last season wasn\u2019t just a flash \u2014 it\u2019s his new normal. He\u2019s shown that in addition to being one of the league\u2019s most versatile defenders, he\u2019s also a capable No. 1 option on offense. No one was sure of that when he was drafting off of the presence of Leonard last season. But Siakam is legit and that\u2019s a huge reason why the Raptors have a chance to win the East again. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, Siakam has an effective field goal percentage of 67.4% in the first six seconds of the shot clock and just 47.4% thereafter. That\u2019s the biggest drop among 71 players with at least 100 field goal attempts in the first six seconds. Adebayo\u2019s transformation from promising prospect to All-Star and one of the best young bigs in the league is one of the reasons the Heat were able to crash the Eastern Conference playoff party in Jimmy Butler\u2019s first season with the franchise. Adebayo is all of the things former center Hassan Whiteside never was and more. His fundamentals are sound and his instincts, particularly on defense, are next level. Just watch him against the best competition and you\u2019ll understand how his competitive edge fuels his fire and helps elevate the Heat to another level. Number to know: Among 234 players who have played in at least 40 games in each of the last two seasons, Adebayo has seen the fifth biggest jump in minutes per game ( from 23.3 to 34.4 ), the 11th biggest jump in points per game (from 8.9 to 16.2), the second biggest jump in rebounds per game (from 7.3 to 10.5), and the third biggest jump in assists per game (from 2.2 to 5.1). The other half of the highest scoring duo in the league, Westbrook has silenced any doubters who wondered if he\u2019d be able to thrive in his role playing alongside his good friend James Harden. Westbrook knows how to play to his strengths and clearly understands how to play effectively off the ball when Harden is in attack mode. His energy will be crucial in the bubble, where the Rockets\u2019 small-ball approach could be a wrinkle teams won\u2019t have the chance to prepare for given the compressed schedule. Number to know: Westbrook leads the league with 20.5 drives per game and ranks second with 15.2 points in the paint per game. He\u2019s just the fifth different player to average at least 15 points in the paint per game (minimum 40 games played) in the 24 seasons for which points in the paint have been tracked. At 6-3, he\u2019s seven inches shorter than any of the other four. Say what you want about Butler\u2019s successful and somewhat checkered past in Chicago, Minnesota and Philadelphia. But there\u2019s a strong argument that his free-agent choice might have had the biggest bang for the buck of last summer\u2019s moves. Butler elevated the Heat to another level, his arrival coinciding perfectly with the rise of guys like Adebayo, Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro. Butler\u2019s relentless, grimy work on both ends of the floor provides the perfect edge for a blue-collar Heat bunch that is poised to make some serious noise in the bubble come playoff time. Number to know: Butler has a free throw rate of 67.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field, the second-highest rate among 229 players with at least 300 field goal attempts and up from 40.4 last season. Tatum\u2019s star turn after the All-Star break (when his scoring average went from 22.4 points to 29.9 ppg over a nine-game stretch) was the game changer the Celtics were looking for. Their core four of Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward is as potent a group as there is in the league when they\u2019re all healthy and locked in. Tatum appears to be the alpha there, with his ability to score at all levels and his unshakable confidence. There\u2019s a reason LeBron James praised Tatum as an \u201cABSOLUTE PROBLEM\u201d in an Instagram shoutout. Number to know: Tatum has an effective field goal percentage of 61.1% in the clutch (score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime). That\u2019s the second best mark among 28 players who have attempted at least 50 clutch shots. Don\u2019t confuse Lillard\u2019s reservations about the format and bubble environment as a sign that he\u2019ll be anything but his ruthless, competitive best when the action begins in Orlando. The Trail Blazers will need it to be \u201cDame Time\u201d all the time if they are going to fight their way into the playoffs. Like so many of the other stars on the list, the pandemic afforded Lillard the time his body needed to heal, even if it came at the expense of the rust that no doubt was accrued during the shutdown. No one doubts he will be ready, though. He\u2019s built for the biggest moments. Number to know: Lillard ranks second with 13.5 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game. The 1.14 points per possession he\u2019s scored on ball-handler possessions is the best mark among 49 players who have averaged at least five per game. 10. Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder  With all of his responsibilities as head of the National Basketball Players Association, it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that Paul has been the catalyst for one of the league\u2019s biggest surprise teams this season. The Thunder roll into the restart with a huge opportunity to move up in the standings if they can play well in the seeding games. Given the setting, having the league\u2019s leader in clutch points (144), the man with the best fourth quarter +\/- rating (+169) could be crucial to the Thunder\u2019s chances of making an extended playoff run. Number to know: Paul leads the league in clutch games (42) and minutes (160) played, as well as clutch points (144), field goals (46) and steals (10). He has shot 43-for-46 (93%) on clutch free throws, the best mark among 32 players who have attempted at least 25. A healthy George is the key ingredient for the championship dreams Clippers fans have been holding onto since last summer. A 1-2 superstar punch of Kawhi Leonard and George is as good as it gets on both ends, with each of them being capable of the best offensive and defensive player on the floor at any given moment. Whatever issues the Clippers dealt with when they came together this time a year are in the past. The chemistry is tight, roles are defined and Doc Rivers knows exactly what he\u2019ll get from his biggest stars. Number to know: George has shot 32-for-57 (56.1%) on corner 3-pointers, the best mark among 108 players with at least 50 corner-3 attempts. Jokic\u2019s positive COVID-19 test complicates what had the makings of a stunning hiatus body makeover for the All-Star big man. Jokic is reportedly dealing with some travel-related issues trying to make his way to Orlando from his native Serbia. But make no mistake, Jokic in tip-top shape as the centerpiece of the Nuggets\u2019 attack gives coach Mike Malone\u2019s crew a fighting chance to play deep into the playoffs. If Jokic\u2019s conditioning matches his elite skill-set, the other teams in the bubble better beware. Number to know: Jokic has shot 60.5% on non-restricted-area paint shots, the best mark among 95 players who have attempted at least 100. The shutdown couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Embiid, who was coming back from a five-game absence with a shoulder injury when the coronavirus disrupted everything. The time off to get both healthy and in better shape allowed Embiid to show up in Orlando refreshed and focused on living up to his hype as the best big man in the game. If he plays to his potential, Embiid won\u2019t have a physical match on the Walt Disney World grounds. But it\u2019s always \u201cif\u201d where Embiid is concerned. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, Embiid has averaged a league-high 9.7 post-ups per game . According to Synergy play-type tracking, his 1.12 points per possession on post-ups is the best mark among 21 players who have averaged at least 2.5 post-up possessions per game. The season hiatus interrupted what was a transcendent, Kia MVP-caliber season for Doncic. The league\u2019s leader in triple-doubles (14), Doncic also ranks in the top six in scoring and top four in assists. Perhaps even more impressive, Doncic is the best rebounding guard in the league. The bubble provides yet another opportunity for him to show that he belongs in the conversation for best overall players in the game in just his second NBA season. Number to know: Doncic is the only player who has averaged at least 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists per game and leads the league with 14 triple-doubles. Harden is the catalyst for the highest scoring duo in the league and you better believe he and Westbrook will hit the bubble on a mission to upend the plans of the Los Angeles teams as they eyeball a berth to the Western Conference finals. Harden did some serious work on his body during the shutdown, with pictures of his tightened-up physique sending shock waves on social media. Harden\u2019s history of wearing down in the postseason shouldn\u2019t be an issue this time around. Number to know: Harden has 19 40-point games, eight more than any other player. The Rockets are 17-2 in those games. Davis is one of only two players in the league this season that could make a legitimate claim to own the titles of both Kia MVP and Kia Defensive Player of the Year (Giannis Antetokounmpo is the other). The Lakers\u2019 championship hopes rest on the shoulders of its two biggest stars. Davis and LeBron James know exactly what\u2019s at stake in the bubble. The reason so many pundits believe the Lakers are the favorites is because no other team boasts a duo as dominant or dynamic. Davis has yet to engineer a true breakout postseason performance, so this could be the time. Number to know: Opponents have shot 38.5% on shots that Davis has defended. The difference between that and their expected field goal percentage on those shots (46.7%) is the second biggest among 271 players who have defended at least 300 field goal attempts total. Kawhi is one more Finals MVP run from overtaking Giannis and LeBron for the title of best player in the game. Some would argue he already has. Whatever precautions the Clippers took with his maintenance program before the season hiatus should not be an issue in the bubble. With Leonard and George operating at the highest level on both ends, the Clippers\u2019 talent and depth could pave the way for a showdown with the Lakers that the basketball world has been clamoring for since last summer\u2019s free agency. Number to know: Leonard has recorded assists on 16.4% of his possessions, the highest rate of his career by a wide margin. Championship or bust. At this stage of the game that\u2019s the only way to define what awaits the league\u2019s most high-profile and influential player in the Orlando bubble. When you perform at a Kia MVP level in your 17th season and are chasing the legacy LeBron is by trying to lead his third different team to a title, the ramifications of this unprecedented scenario are epic. The league\u2019s assist leader is grinding as hard as ever, so you should expect nothing short of his best when the action kicks off in Orlando. Number to know: James leads the league with a career-high 10.6 assists per game. According to Second Spectrum tracking, he also leads the league with 26.5 assist points created per game (26.5), 4.6 \u201cpass-ahead\u201d passes per game, and 1.5 skip passes per game. The reigning Kia MVP was in the midst of a brilliant encore campaign when the season went on hiatus back on March 11. If Giannis wasn\u2019t at the top of your MVP ballot, he was no lower than second. Leading the Bucks to the best record in the league with one dominant performance after another was proof that \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is still in the ascension phase of his development. He\u2019s still got plenty of room to grow his game. The bubble is yet another platform for Giannis to run wild on the competition. Number to know: Antetokounmpo leads the league with 8.2 fouls drawn per game . He\u2019s the only player who has played at least 500 minutes and accounted for more than half the fouls his team has drawn while he\u2019s been on the floor. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Nets signed three-time Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford and Michael Beasley as substitute players for the remainder of the season. In addition, the Nets also added forward\/center Donta Hall on June 10. The Nets will resume play without Spencer Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan after they tested positive for the coronavirus. Wilson Chandler also chose not to play, and Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving aren\u2019t returning from their injuries. On the day the Nets practiced for the first time on the Walt Disney World Resort campus, they added a pair of players who can put up points. The 40-year-old Crawford hasn\u2019t played in the NBA this season after scoring 51 points while playing for Phoenix in the finale of the 2018-19 season. That made him the first player in NBA history with 50-point games for four different teams. He has averaged 14.6 points in 1,326 games, most among active players, over 19 seasons. Beasley was the No. 2 pick in the 2008 draft and has averaged 12.4 points in 609 games over 11 seasons. He hasn\u2019t played in the NBA since appearing for the Lakers in February 2019. Beasley won\u2019t be eligible to play until the sixth of Brooklyn\u2019s eight seeding games because he has serve a suspension for violating the drug policy. Hall appeared in four games for the Detroit Pistons this season, averaging 1.5 ppg and 3.8 rpg. He played 38 games for the Grand Rapids Drive of the NBA G League, averaging 15.4 ppg, 10.5 rpg and 1.3 bpg, earning All-NBA G League Second Team and All-Rookie Team honors. The Nets also got started without Tyler Johnson, who also was signed recently. General manager Sean Marks said he didn\u2019t travel with the team for personal reasons but would join the Nets soon.

He had just walked off the court after the first Orlando Magic practice of the restart, and some of his teammates remained on the floor while engaged in a loud and enthusiastic shooting contest. After four months, basketball was truly back. Full-scale practices inside the NBA bubble at the Disney complex started Thursday, with the Magic \u2014 the first team to get into the campus earlier this week \u2014 becoming the first team formally back on the floor.

Lakers forward LeBron James lamented saying farewell to his family, and 76ers forward Joel Embiid \u2014 who raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said he was \u201cnot a big fan of the idea\u201d of restarting the season in a bubble \u2014 showed up for his team\u2019s flight in what appeared to be a full hazmat suit. \u201cJust left the crib to head to the bubble. \u2026 Hated to leave the #JamesGang,\u201d James posted on Twitter. Another last-day arrival at the Disney campus was the reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors, who boarded buses for the two-hour drive from Naples, Florida \u2014 they\u2019ve been there for about two weeks, training at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers \u2014 for the trip to the bubble. The buses were specially wrapped for the occasion, with the Raptors\u2019 logo and the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d displayed on the sides . Brooklyn, Utah, Washington and Phoenix all were down to practice Thursday, along with the Magic. Denver was originally scheduled to, then pushed back its opening session to Friday. By Saturday, practices will be constant \u2014 22 teams working out at various times in a window spanning 13 1\/2 hours and spread out across seven different facilities. Exhibition games begin July 22. Games restart again for real on July 30. \u201cIt just felt good to be back on the floor,\u201d said Brooklyn interim coach Jacque Vaughn, who took over for Kenny Atkinson less than a week before the March 11 suspension of the season because of the coronavirus. \u201cI think that was the most exciting thing. We got a little conditioning underneath us. Didn\u2019t go too hard after the quarantine, wanted to get guys to just run up and down a little bit and feel the ball again.\u201d Teams, for the most part, had to wait two days after arriving before they could get on the practice floor. Many players have passed the time with video games; Miami center Meyers Leonard, with the Heat not practicing for the first time until Friday, has been giving fans glimpses of everything from his gaming setup to his room service order for his first dinner at Disney \u2014 replete with lobster bisque, a burger, chicken strips and some Coors Light to wash it all down. The food has been a big talking point so far, especially after a handful of players turned to social media to share what got portrayed as less-than-superb meals during the brief quarantine period. \u201cFor the most part, everything has been pretty good in my opinion,\u201d Nets guard Joe Harris said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job taking care of us and making sure to accommodate us in every area as much as possible.\u201d Learning the campus has been another key for the first few days, and that process likely will continue for a while since teams will be using all sorts of different facilities while getting back into the practice routine. \u201cWe have to make the best out of it,\u201d Vucevic said. \u201cYou know, this is our job. We\u2019re going to try to make the best out of it. I really think the NBA did the best they could to know make this as good as they can for us. And once we start playing, you\u2019re not going to be thinking about the little things.\u201d"},{"id":27087,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jamal-crawford-signs-nets-official-release","date":"2020-07-09","title":"Nets sign free agent guard Jamal Crawford","content":" BROOKLYN \u2014 The Brooklyn Nets have signed guard Jamal Crawford as a Substitute Player for the remainder of the 2019-20 season.

Prime Sports Marketing and company president Gina Ford filed a lawsuit last summer in a Florida state court, accusing Williamson and the agency now representing him of breach of contract. That came a week after Williamson filed his own lawsuit in a North Carolina federal court to terminate a five-year contract with Prime Sports after moving to Creative Artists Agency LLC. In court filings Thursday in North Carolina, Ford\u2019s attorneys included a sworn affidavit from a California man who said the head of a Canadian-based firm called Maximum Management Group (MMG) told him he paid Williamson\u2019s family for his commitment to sign with MMG once he left Duke for the NBA. The documents include a marketing agreement signed by Williamson with MMG from May 2019, a December 2019 \u201cletter of declaration\u201d signed by Williamson and his stepfather agreeing to pay $500,000 to MMG president Slavko Duric for \u201crepayment of a loan\u201d from October 2018, and a copy of Williamson\u2019s South Carolina driver\u2019s license. In a statement to The Associated Press , Williamson attorney, Jeffrey S. Klein, said those documents were \u201cfraudulent.\u201d \u201cThe alleged \u2018agreements\u2019 and driver\u2019s license attached to these papers are fraudulent \u2014 and neither Mr. Williamson nor his family know these individuals nor had any dealings with them,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe had previously alerted Ms. Ford\u2019s lawyers to both this fact and that we had previously reported the documents to law enforcement as forgeries, but they chose to go ahead with another frivolous filing anyway. \u201cThis is a desperate and irresponsible attempt to smear Mr. Williamson at the very time he has the opportunity to live his dream of playing professional basketball.\u201d The affidavit is from Donald Kreiss, a self-described entrepreneur who worked with athletes and agents in marketing relationships. He had recently contacted Ford then provided the affidavit last week outlining interactions with MMG and Williamson\u2019s family, according to one of the filings. Ford\u2019s attorneys have sought to focus on Williamson\u2019s eligibility. His lawsuit stated that Prime Sports violated North Carolina\u2019s sports agent law, both by failing to include disclaimers about the loss of eligibility when signing the contract and the fact neither Prime Sports nor Ford were registered with the state. Ford\u2019s attorneys have argued the Uniform Athlete Agents Act wouldn\u2019t apply if Williamson was ineligible to play college basketball from the start. Ford\u2019s attorneys had sought to have last summer\u2019s No. 1 overall NBA draft pick and New Orleans Pelicans rookie answer questions in Florida state court about whether he received improper benefits before playing for the Blue Devils. They had also raised questions about housing for Williamson\u2019s family during his Duke career in a separate filing in North Carolina. A Florida appeals court last month granted a stay to pause the proceedings there, shifting the focus to the North Carolina case. Duke has repeatedly declined to comment on the case because it isn\u2019t involved in the litigation, but issued a statement in January that school had reviewed Williamson\u2019s eligibility previously and found no concerns."},{"id":27157,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-jamal-crawford-brooklyn-nets","date":"2020-07-09","title":"Report: Jamal Crawford to sign with Brooklyn Nets","content":" Veteran guard Jamal Crawford has agreed to a deal to join the Brooklyn Nets, according to The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania.

Instead, the Pacers will be without their leader in Orlando as he continues to rehab from injury. Trade revoked. Oladipo\u2019s decision not to play for the Pacers in the NBA\u2019s 2019-20 season restart dealt a blow to his team\u2019s plans down in Disney. Based on his talents when healthy (or even 90%), the itch his skill set scratches for Indiana and the team\u2019s position as a solid second-tier contender in the Eastern Conference, Oladipo arguably will be the most significant absentee from the bubble in terms of on-court impact up or down. Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal is a more potent scorer, but his team is an afterthought. The Lakers\u2019 Avery Bradley is a valuable role player, especially on defense for a title aspirant. But Oladipo was Indiana\u2019s face and heart, the leading man for a team with ambitions, rebuilt on the fly to target a higher seed. The Pacers traveled Thursday to the Walt Disney World campus and their assigned hotel for quarantine in advance of practices. Their first of three scrimmages is July 23, and they face East rival Philadelphia \u2013 with whom they\u2019re currently tied for fifth (39-26) \u2013 in their seeding-game debut Aug. 1. Oladipo will be down there too, but only for emotional support, brand maintenance, individual work and assorted exertions as he and his physical therapist, Luke Miller, see fit. His decision didn\u2019t blindside coach Nate McMillan or team management \u2013 they have been bystanders to most of Oladipo\u2019s decision-making since he ruptured the quad tendon in his right knee late in January 2019. But it left them reacting somewhat awkwardly to bad news that, let\u2019s face it, scuttled Plan A. \u201cHis decision to make that call last week was his call,\u201d McMillan said Wednesday, talking to reporters on a conference call. \u201cI guess he just didn\u2019t feel he would be ready to go.\u201d McMillan said what, naturally, you would expect: the team supports Oladipo\u2019s decision. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken that role. The player has to be mentally, physically ready to go. That\u2019s the same approach we took with Victor when he was returning the first time and that\u2019s the approach we\u2019ll take now. When he feels he\u2019s ready to go and we both agree to that \u2026 then we\u2019ll put him on the floor. But he feels he\u2019s not ready to play right now.\u201d Oladipo, 28, a two-time All-Star and the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player in 2017-18, sounded almost as if he was ready, even as he announced he wasn\u2019t. \u201cI really want to play, and as a competitor and teammate this is tearing me apart,\u201d he told The Athletic . \u201cI feel like I\u2019m at a great place in my rehab and getting closer and closer to 100 percent.\u201d Yes, so \u2026? \u201cWith all the variables, from how I have to build my 5-on-5 workload back up, to the increased risk of a soft-tissue injury which could delay my rehab, and the unknown exact set-up of the bubble, I just can\u2019t get my mind to being fully comfortable in playing. I have to be smart.\u201d Oladipo, certainly, is entitled to say yea or nay to the bubble. Others have, for reasons as varied as injuries, family issues, virus concerns or consideration of future earnings. But it\u2019s hard to reconcile what we\u2019re hearing now with where Oladipo and the Pacers stood back in January, when he made his return after a year \u2013 a full 82 games \u2013 away. That\u2019s what makes this seem like such a lost opportunity all around. When Oladipo played on Jan. 29 against Chicago, showing more rust than a junkyard Pinto, he still managed to propel the Pacers to an overtime victory with a dramatic 3-pointer at the end of regulation. The team and its medical staff had in place at that time a measured program to re-introduce him into the lineup: 24 minutes a game for the eight games leading into All-Star Weekend (skipping back-to-backs). Oladipo averaged 11.1 points, 2.9 assists and 25 minutes in seven appearances, while shooting 32.9% (24.4 from the arc). Indiana, 30-17 prior to his return, went 2-5 in those seven. Out of the break, Oladipo played six out of 12 before the shutdown. In his final appearance, March 10 against Boston , he scored 27 points with seven rebounds and four assists, hitting 9 of 16 shots in 29 minutes. His stats in the last four: 19.5 points, 4.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists while shooting 45.7%. Very much pre-injury VO numbers. Better still, the Pacers went 5-1 when he played after All-Star. Now four months later \u2013 soon to be six since he stepped on the floor at Bankers Life Fieldhouse vs. the Bulls \u2013 Oladipo feels less capable of playing rather than more. It\u2019s confusing, considering how one of McMillan\u2019s main concerns previously was getting a not-in-game-shape Oladipo up to speed with teammates humming along at top speed. After this shutdown, everybody is out of rhythm and flow. They\u2019d all be tuning up together. A team such as Indiana \u2013 secure in a playoff berth \u2013 could use the seeding games as part of the revival, facing little urgency. So eight games, hmm, maybe 24 minutes for Oladipo again? Sounds familiar. But it won\u2019t be his program this time.  There obviously are other factors involved, none of them helpful to what the Pacers imagine for this summer. Oladipo will be playing in 2020-21 in the final year of a four-year, $84 million extension signed with Oklahoma City in 2016. He\u2019ll be a free agent after that, and already the subject of rumors about future whereabouts. Indiana wants to do right by its player without hurting its own plans. Already some fans are flinching from a possible replay of 2017, when previous franchise face Paul George leveraged his way out of Indianapolis. Team president Kevin Pritchard and the staff did well to get Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis from the Thunder in that forced transaction, but it would be folly to expect that level of save again. Then again, losing Oladipo for nothing in return would put the Pacers right back in the hamster wheel, legs pumping, going nowhere. Could Pritchard and ownership take a serious run at signing him to an extension before next season? OK. Except the player is telling the team loud and clear that he is not healthy, and that even 18 months would not have been a long enough rehab. No matter how superstar-starved Indiana might feel as an unglamorous franchise, at some point you have to listen to him and see his 2020-21 self. With a roster that again might be significantly changed. Meanwhile, the Pacers\u2019 chances of getting out of the first round for the first time since 2014 aren\u2019t looking good. Scoring wing Jeremy Lamb (ACL surgery) also is out. Malcolm Brogdon might return slowly from his positive coronavirus test. Aaron Holiday will be pressed into heavier minutes, and it dings the backcourt depth overall. The Pacers got to Orlando Thursday. But the cavalry they counted on won\u2019t be bugling their way. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The exact amount, Mills said, for the Spurs\u2019 eight remaining regular-season, or seeding, games will be $1,017,818.54. He will split that money between three causes \u2014 Black Lives Matter Australia, another group that deals with the problem of Blacks dying when in custody, and to the newly formed We Got You campaign that he helped organize to address the issues of racism within Australian sport. \u201cSo, I\u2019m playing in Orlando because I don\u2019t want to leave any money on the table that could be going directly to Black communities,\u201d Mills said. Mills isn\u2019t the only player that has announced he will be donating his salary for the eight games to charity. Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard revealed earlier this week that he will give the remainder of his salary for the season to a charitable initiative he started called Breathe Again, which was designed to fight hatred and racism.

Mills \u2014 an Australian whose mother is Aboriginal and whose father is from the Torres Strait Islands \u2014 and the Spurs hosted a celebration of Indigenous people back in January, which he hoped helped educate people on the importance of recognizing the value of other cultures. \u201cAustralia is a great country.

There\u2019s contesting the shots that are taken near the basket, and there\u2019s preventing those shots from being taken. Both aspects are equally important. The Philadelphia 76ers are in the middle of the pack in regard to both, ranking 18th in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (64.4%) and 17th in the percentage of their opponents shots that have come in the restricted area (33%). But when it comes to protecting the rim, there are two different Sixers: The Sixers with Joel Embiid on the floor and the Sixers with Embiid off the floor. With Embiid off the floor, 36% of their opponents\u2019 shots have come in the restricted area, and their opponents have shot 66.3% there. With Embiid on the floor, those numbers are just 28% and 61.3%. According to Second Spectrum tracking data, Embiid doesn\u2019t rank very high among high-volume rim protectors , with opponents having shot 60.1% at the rim when he\u2019s been there. That number for two-time defending Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert is just 50.4%. But the prevention aspect of rim protection is where Embiid really shines when you compare his team\u2019s numbers with him on the floor (28% of opponent shots in the restricted area) vs. with him off the floor (36%). For Gobert, that differential is just 29% (Gobert on the floor) vs. 30% (Gobert off the floor). The rim protector who\u2019s come closest to Embiid\u2019s on-court impact (in regard to prevention) is Dwight Howard. Lakers opponents have taken 29% of their shots in the restricted area with Howard on the floor, and have taken 36% of their shots there with him off the floor. But those opponents have shot much better in the restricted area with Howard on the floor (65.7%) than they have with him on the floor (58.0%). When you combine Embiid\u2019s impact in regard to both preventing and defending shots, Philly opponents have averaged 10.2 fewer points per 48 minutes in the restricted area with him on the floor than they have with him off the floor. That\u2019s the biggest differential among 329 players who have played at least 500 minutes for a single team. Kristaps Porzingis and Larry Nance Jr. are the only other bigs in the top 10, though the Suns\u2019 Aron Baynes (-6.1) is 11th on the list. Other bigs with a differential of at least five points per 48 minutes are P.J. Tucker (-5.9), Dewayne Dedmon (-5.8 in his time with Sacramento), Mitchell Robinson (-5.7) and Hassan Whiteside (-5.4). Given Embiid\u2019s size and skills on defense, the Sixers do their best to keep him near the basket as much as possible. To break down how that works, we\u2019ll look at some film from one of Philly\u2019s best wins of the season, their Feb. 11 victory over the LA Clippers , in which the Clips scored just 26 points in the restricted area , 10 fewer than their season average . Only 12 of those 26 came in Embiid\u2019s 28:10 on the floor. Less than 10 seconds into the game, we see how Embiid is going to be guarding Clippers center Ivica Zubac. Really, he\u2019s not going to be guarding him: If Zubac has the ball, Embiid is free to hang out in the paint. When Zubac doesn\u2019t have the ball, Embiid must be \u201cactively guarding\u201d (within arm\u2019s reach of) somebody or he\u2019ll be subject to a Defensive Three-Second count. Remaining in the paint allows Embiid to prevent the other Clippers from getting to the basket: Play 1. Ben Simmons gambles and takes himself out of the play when the ball is swung to Kawhi Leonard on the left wing, but Embiid is there to prevent a Leonard drive and allow Simmons to recover. Then, with Josh Richardson trailing Paul George around a double-screen on the right side, Embiid is there to keep George out of the paint. Richardson is able to get back in front, block George\u2019s shot, and then force another mid-range attempt on a late-clock isolation. Number to know: Richardson (0.7), Matisse Thybulle (0.7) and Simmons (0.6) are all in the top 16 among guards in blocks per game . Play 2. Leonard inbounds the ball and then gets a back-screen from Lou Williams. Though his man has the ball 23 feet from the basket, Embiid helps keep Leonard from getting to post-up position on the other side of the floor. The result is another late-clock iso where Marcus Morris misses a tough shot over Al Horford. Number to know: The Sixers rank third in clutch defense , having allowed just 96.8 points per 100 possessions with the score within five points in the last five minutes. Embiid sagging off Zubac to protect the paint allows the Sixers\u2019 perimeter players to \u201ctop-lock\u201d the guys they\u2019re defending and make it difficult for the opponent to cleanly run its pin-down screens, cross-screens and dribble hand-offs. Here\u2019s Josh Richardson top-locking as Zubac looks to set a cross-screen for George. Embiid is in the paint, calling out the action and ready to cover for Richardson should George cut back-door: In the two plays in the video above, the guy Embiid was guarding wasn\u2019t involved in the primary action. More often (and because of the way he sits back in the paint), the primary action involves Embiid\u2019s man setting a screen. And on ball screens, Embiid is a classic \u201cdrop\u201d defender, sitting back in the paint to protect the basket and encourage the ball-handler to take an inefficient mid-range or non-restricted-area paint shot. Play 1. Zubac sets an early screen for George toward the middle of the floor. Furkan Korkmaz trails George around the screen and Embiid forces a foul-line jumper that\u2019s off the mark. Number to know: According to Synergy play-type tracking, 23.4% of Sixers\u2019 opponent possessions, the league\u2019s highest opponent rate , have been pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions. Play 2. Sagging off Zubac, Embiid again helps Simmons keep Leonard from establishing post position at the left block. Morris eventually gets a ball-screen from Zubac and, with Embiid\u2019s hands down at his sides, is able to step into a comfortable elbow jumper. Number to know: The 0.86 points per possession the Sixers have allowed on ball-handler possessions ranks 10th . Play 3. This is the play from the image above, where Richardson is top-locking George to prevent him from curling off Zubac\u2019s cross-screen. He continues to deny George and we get a late Leonard\/Zubac pick-and-roll where Simmons gets caught in the screen and Leonard misses a long, pull-up shot. Number to know: 15.6% of Philly opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s third highest opponent rate, have come from mid-range (between the paint and the 3-point line). Leonard shot 26-for-43 (60.5%) from mid-range in last year\u2019s conference semifinals. Play 4. Richardson switches a hand-off from George to Morris, who backs out and gets another ball-screen from Zubac. This time, he snakes toward another jumper from the right elbow, but Embiid gets his hand up to prevent it from coming in rhythm. Morris resets and misses a fadeaway. There\u2019s a subtle but important difference between disengaged drop coverage with the big defender\u2019s hands down at his sides (hello Alex Len) and engaged drop coverage with the big having active hands and feet. Number to know: The Sixers are one of four teams \u2013 the Celtics, Clippers and Bucks are the others \u2013 that rank in the top 10 in both opponent field goal percentage on shots from between the restricted area and the 3-point line (39.3%, ninth) and the highest percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from between the restricted area and the 3-point line (33%, third). Embiid hanging out in the paint puts a lot of pressure on the Sixers\u2019 perimeter players in regard to navigating screens that Embiid\u2019s man sets. This is not the Houston Rockets\u2019 defense , where there\u2019s always another defender to switch the screen. It\u2019s on the target of the screen to get around it and get back in the play. Play 1. This is the first play of the game and the exact same set as the first play in the first video above. When George comes off that double-screen on the right side of the floor, Richardson gets bumped off the play by Zubac and there\u2019s nobody there to contest George\u2019s catch-and-shoot 3-pointer. When the Clippers ran it again the next time down the floor (in the first video), Richardson had a cleaner path around the screens, George curled tighter off the second one, and Embiid met him at the elbow. Number to know: The Sixers have been at their best, both offensively and defensively, in the first quarter, outscoring their opponents by 10.0 points per 100 possessions in the opening 12 minutes. They\u2019ve outscored their opponents by 175 total points in the first quarter and have been outscored by 31 points thereafter . Play 2. Tobias Harris is able to get over the initial hand-off from Zubac to Morris. But then they run another one on the left side of the floor and Zubac sets an additional screen that Harris has to deal with by himself because Embiid is 10 feet away. Morris is able to rise for a pull-up 3-pointer. Number to know: Because they don\u2019t allow a lot of 3-point attempts, the Sixers\u2019 record hasn\u2019t depended much on how well their opponents have shot from beyond the arc. Teams are just 9-9 (the Clippers were 1-1) when they\u2019ve shot 40% or better from 3-point range against Philly. Play 3. Shooters make the best screeners and the Clippers set things up by having Landry Shamet set a back-screen for Leonard to get to the right block. Embiid is there to deal with Leonard while Simmons gets around the screen, but then Thybulle doesn\u2019t have any help as Shamet immediately curls around a screen from Zubac. Thybulle is able to chase Shamet off the 3-point line, but he\u2019s able to get to a pull-up jumper inside the right elbow. Number to know: The Sixers have had the 10th best defense (110.4 points allowed per 100 possessions in 23 games) against the league\u2019s top-10 offenses . That breaks down to 100.0 points allowed per 100 possessions in 10 home games (in which they went 8-2) and 118.5 in 13 road games (in which they went 2-11) against that group. The worst offensive games of the season for both the Celtics (93 points on 103 possessions) and Lakers (91 on 101) were in Philadelphia. The Nuggets, Heat and Jazz all had their third worst offensive games of the season in Philly. Play 4. With Glenn Robinson top-locking in the left corner, Shamet takes the inside path around a double-pin-down screen from the Clippers\u2019 two bigs. With Embiid sagging in the paint, Zubac then flips the second screen for Shamet to step into a pull-up 3-pointer. Number to know: The Sixers have allowed 9.4 fewer points per 100 possessions at home (102.7, second best ) than they have on the road (112.1, 20th ). That\u2019s the league\u2019s biggest home-road differential in defensive efficiency. Play 5. George gets a hand-off from Williams and a ball-screen from Zubac. Richardson dips his lead shoulder (a Paul George technique, actually) to get around the Zubac screen and contest the shot. Number to know: The home-road difference has been about the same in Embiid\u2019s minutes on the floor ( 97.3 vs. 106.6 points allowed per 100 possessions ) as it has been in his minutes off the floor ( 104.1 vs. 113.1 ). Embiid hanging in the paint makes life tougher for the Sixers\u2019 perimeter players. But the group is very good at getting around those screens and getting back into the play. Size matters on that end of the floor and when your point guard is 6-foot-10, he can get around a screen and still block a shot . Al Horford was brought in to help the Sixers when Embiid rests. Philly was, amazingly, outscored by 109 points in 99 minutes with Embiid off the floor in their conference semifinals series against Toronto last year. That stat remains incomprehensible. The Sixers have been better with Embiid off the floor this season ( plus-0.3 points per 100 possessions ) than they were last regular season ( minus-3.5 per 100 ). But there\u2019s been an even bigger difference in how well they\u2019ve defended with him on the floor vs. how well they\u2019ve defended with him off the floor. Horford has been an elite defender in this league. It was just two years ago when he did a terrific job keeping both Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo in check in the playoffs. When he\u2019s at the five, he generally plays the same drop scheme as Embiid. But he\u2019s not as big or, at 33 years old (he turned 34 in June), as quick. Play 1. Montrezl Harrell quickly rolls out of an early screen for George on the left side of the floor. Horford is above the foul line and Harrell is able to get behind him for a layup. Number to know: The Sixers have seen the league\u2019s third biggest drop in pace, averaging 99.4 possessions per 48 minutes ( 19th ), down from 102.6 ( eighth ) last season. Play 2. When Korkmaz doesn\u2019t stop the ball on a \u201cpistol\u201d action (Shamet setting a screen for Williams along the left sideline) and Richardson is trailing Williams\u2019 drive, Horford is seemingly in position to help on the baseline. But he doesn\u2019t stop Williams either. Number to know: Though they rank sixth defensively overall, the Sixers rank in the top 10 in only one of the \u201cfour factors\u201d on defense. They rank third in defensive rebounding percentage , but are 12th in opponent effective field goal percentage , 26th in opponent free throw rate , and 18th in opponent turnover percentage . Play 3. As Williams brings the ball up the right side of the floor, Richardson is top-locking against George. So George pushes Richardson into a screen for Williams. Stationed at the nail (the middle of the foul line), Horford sees what\u2019s happening, but isn\u2019t able to get to the rim in time. Number to know: With Simmons playing less than five minutes and Embiid missing five of their 10 games, the Sixers allowed 9.6 more points per 100 possessions after the All-Star break (115.7, 25th ) than they did before it (106.1, fourth ). That was the league\u2019s biggest post-break jump in defensive efficiency. Embiid himself is not a perfect defender. In this same game, the Williams\/Harrell pick-and-roll produced two layups ( one , two ) for the Clippers\u2019 back-up center. And Embiid isn\u2019t great at avoiding fouls. His 4.1 fouls per 36 minutes are the 21st most among 228 players who have played at least 1,000 minutes, and he got caught a couple of times \u2013 reaching in against George , taking a bad angle against Leonard \u2013 in his drop coverage against the Clips. But when he\u2019s engaged, he\u2019s a force on that end of the floor. Late in the fourth quarter, he showed off his mobility, smothering a Morris isolation to help the Sixers seal the win. He doesn\u2019t venture outside the paint often, though. When the Sixers have played the Bucks, Embiid has primarily defended Antetokounmpo, instead of Brook Lopez, the more prolific 3-point shooter. And he\u2019s treated the reigning MVP much like a non-shooting center\u2026 Parking Embiid in the paint has been the way to go for the Sixers, who have allowed 8.0 fewer points per 100 possessions with Embiid on the floor (101.4) than they have with him off the floor (109.4). That\u2019s the league\u2019s second biggest on-off-court differential among full-time starters in regard to defensive efficiency. The biggest ( 8.5 per 100 ) belongs to Paul Millsap, whose differential is more about how Denver opponents have shot from outside the paint. So you\u2019d have a difficult time arguing that Embiid isn\u2019t the most impactful defender in the NBA. Having the big man behind them has allowed the Sixers\u2019 guards and forwards to be more aggressive on the perimeter. While the switch-everything Rockets are trying to keep the ball in front of them, the Sixers are happy to funnel it toward their seven-footer. With the top-locking and chasing over screens, Philly opponents have taken only 33.8% of their shots, the league\u2019s lowest rate, from 3-point range. The Sixers are the only team that has allowed fewer than two corner 3-pointers per game . Overall, the Sixers have had a somewhat disappointing season. But with Simmons, Embiid and a talented supporting cast, they still have a very high ceiling. They have wins over 10 of the other 12 teams with winning records ( they\u2019re 0-3 against Houston and Dallas ) and they\u2019re one of two teams \u2013 the Celtics are the other \u2013 with double-digit wins over both the Bucks (with Antetokounmpo in the lineup) and Lakers (with LeBron James in the lineup). We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen when the season resumes. But we can be confident that getting to the basket will be difficult when Joel Embiid is stationed in the paint. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

In advance of the other 21 teams descending on central Florida, and as the only NBA team faced with international travel and heightened medical restrictions crossing into the United States, the Raptors began their trial-balloon bubble two weeks ago in Fort Myers, Fla. They\u2019ll head to the Walt Disney World complex outside Orlando this week \u2014 with early experience at what the other teams will face on and off the court. The canaries are doing fine, thanks for asking. \u201cLet\u2019s not get overconfident, but let\u2019s say slightly more confident,\u201d was the way Raptors coach Nick Nurse described his comfort level Tuesday afternoon in a media conference call. \u201cI would say I feel much more safe than maybe I thought I was going to. \u201cEach day of testing that goes by, you\u2019ve got a bit of anxiety to get that email that night from the doc and see what the results are. That\u2019s been good.\u201d \u201cTo me,\u201d Nurse added, \u201cit feels like we\u2019re in a safe environment. We\u2019re going a long ways out of your way to make it extra safe. Which we should.\u201d Toronto guard Fred VanVleet said last week the restart idea sounded good in theory, not so much as he got ready to travel to Florida. All-Star forward Pascal Siakam said Friday that seeing an increase in positive test results in that state \u201ckind of scared\u201d him, but he too had faith that the league protocols would hold. The NBA\u2019s bold experiment to resume a season that was halted March 11 will depend on its ability to avoid or minimize the coronavirus spread inside the self-contained campus it has designed. Once all participants and support staff of the 22 clubs are inside, strict protocols will be in place for a reduced schedule of \u201cseeding games,\u201d possibly followed by a play-in round, then by a traditional 16-team playoff bracket. Initial testing of players who participated in workouts at their team\u2019s specific facilities revealed 25 positive results out of 351 administered tests (7.1 percent). Additionally, 10 of 884 team staff employees tested positive for the virus that can lead to COVID-19. Nurse, however, said the member of Toronto\u2019s traveling party are healthy. In fact, for an ad-hoc training camp staged before the big ramp-up in Orlando \u2014 games begin on July 30 \u2014 the Raptors seem to be faring well. \u201cWe\u2019ve been solid,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI really like the individual work that a lot of our young guys have gotten. It\u2019s been way more consistent. When you\u2019re not flying and playing and games interrupting, and there\u2019s late flights where you need a day off the next day, it\u2019s just been a consistent block of work. Both in the weight room and on the court. Obviously nutrition.\u201d Presumably none of the Raptors are sneaking out of the luxury resort hotel on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast for a taco run. Their coach lauded the players\u2019 approach so far. \u201cThey\u2019ve had great attitudes,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI haven\u2019t sensed hardly any boredom or waning or \u2018Not another day of 1-on-0 work.\u2019 I\u2019ve sensed great energy, great professionalism. The guys have been in the gym. Even though it\u2019s different, it\u2019s still pretty good. We\u2019ve got our music playing, and when you look across the floor, guys are working, sweating and getting better.\u201d And away from the gym? \u201cIn the hotel, we\u2019re confined,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe\u2019re away from everything. It\u2019s just clean all over the place. Everybody\u2019s wearing masks. When we go to the gym, there\u2019s cleaning, and we come back. It feels safe.\u201d Like the other 21 teams, the Raptors are traveling this week to their Disney World hotels and the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex. All teams will adhere to strict guidelines and frequent swabs. \u201cI\u2019d imagine, we\u2019ll go in there, and the early days and early stages of the Disney thing are critical, getting a whole bunch of testing done,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think it will all be done at a really high level. And remain fairly safe.\u201d The Raptors have had a hotel to themselves in Fort Myers, while holding workouts at Florida Gulf Coast University. The practice time has been regimented, mostly individual work on the court, with some strength training and conditioning. That\u2019s the grind of NBA prep work. Soon, assuming the tests stay negative, teams will be permitted to scrimmage. Said Nurse: \u201cI would assume that once they give us a chance to play and have multiple people on the floor, guys are going to want to get up and down. I could see very short \u2026 drill work and getting right to the 5-on-5 play. I\u2019m sensing they really want to play basketball.\u201d Getting guys into proverbial \u201cbasketball shape\u201d will mean pushing them after a layoff of four months, without pushing too hard. Toronto will rely on Alex McKechnie, its director of sports science, and his staff to strike a balance. \u201cYou know it\u2019s a concern,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cJust think back to how hard we were playing and how fast Golden State was moving in those Finals. We\u2019re a long way away from that, but we need to get back to that at some point.\u201d At 46-18 when the season paused, the Raptors will start the eight seeding games in second place, 6.5 games behind Milwaukee and three ahead of Boston. Even with 2019 Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard gone to the Clippers this season, they are a top contender to reach the championship round again and even defend their title. If they stick in the bubble that long \u2014 a Game 7 of the Finals would be Oct. 13 \u2014 they\u2019ll be gone from home nearly four months. No family or friends can join them at Disney until after the playoffs\u2019 first round. That means serious separation for couples and, especially, young families. \u201cIt\u2019s another little part of the puzzle, right? And it\u2019s a big one,\u201d said Nurse, who has three young boys with wife Roberta. \u201cFor me, I would say it starts with a conversation. When you\u2019re bumping into Fred or Kyle [Lowry] and you\u2019re asking \u2018em \u2018How are the wife and kids? What are they doing? When was the last time you talked to \u2018em?\u2019 There\u2019s a lot more of that going on than I would say normally would happen.\u201d That means opening up photos from home on the cellphone to show each other. It also means treading lightly, Nurse said, if a player happens to get a FaceTime call from his child at an inconvenient moment, like a film session or meeting. \u201cSometimes hooking up with schedules and kids when those FaceTime calls come, you\u2019ve got to take \u2019em and drop everything you\u2019re doing,\u201d Nurse said. Nurse\u2019s youngest son was born last spring during the Finals against Golden State. His others are old enough to really miss their father. There is no great way to handle the distance, as he found out when leaving for Fort Myers. \u201cWhen I left, [Leo] being a 3-year-old kid, he \u2026 didn\u2019t quite understand how long I\u2019m gonna be gone,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019m gonna go coach some games,\u2019 he said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m gonna wait right here for you.\u2019 \u201cI hope he\u2019s moved from that spot because it\u2019s gonna be a while.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

No team has had an actual practice yet. Most of the work that has gone on in those buildings during the NBA\u2019s shutdown has been voluntary, and all of it has been of the individual variety \u2014 one player working at one basket with one ball. That changes starting Thursday, when the first handful of teams at the Disney complex will be permitted to have full-fledged practices again. \u201cEvery day will be an adventure, a little bit of, \u2018OK, here\u2019s where we are today, this practice will reflect this, tomorrow\u2019s practice might be totally different,\u2019\u201d Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what makes it interesting. It makes it fun. But it\u2019s a little bit like a training camp. Every year you know you lay out all these grand plans and about the third practice you go, \u2018Ooop, they\u2019re out.\u2019\u201d The teams that arrived at Disney on Tuesday, assuming quarantines are completed and other issues haven\u2019t popped up, will likely be permitted to practice sometime Thursday. More teams arrive Wednesday and Thursday, so their first practice sessions, in theory, would be as early as Friday and Saturday respectively. Teams will be assigned a three-hour window and be able to run practice on a pair of side-by-side courts, with training and weight rooms nearby. Disney staff will clean and disinfect everything after one team leaves, preparing it for the next team to arrive. \u201cJust like with probably everything the league is doing, I think it\u2019d be wise to have a degree of flexibility sprinkled in with everything that you\u2019re planning, a degree of being able to either back off or turn it up a little bit, either way,\u201d Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cBut to be honest with you, that happens a lot even in the normal season. There\u2019s a plan for the first practice and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Players haven\u2019t even been allowed to play 1-on-1 yet at team facilities, per the rules of the individual workouts. That all changes at Disney, where teams will be able to practice for about two weeks before a series of three scrimmages begin on July 22. The season resumes on July 30. Players have said throughout the shutdown that having only three weeks of actual practice to get ready for game action may not be enough \u2014 but that\u2019s what the league ultimately decided the schedule would allow. Most NBA coaches \u2014 D\u2019Antoni, Budenholzer, Dallas\u2019 Rick Carlisle and more \u2014 are going into this believing that plans have to be flexible. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical training camp where you jump in on Day One and just go full-bore,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cOur players have done a great job of working on their individual conditioning with individual workouts with the coaches on the floor on a 1-to-1 basis \u2026 so I feel really good about where we\u2019re at. But this is a different situation, it\u2019s a different time, it\u2019s a different set of circumstances.\u201d Toronto, the reigning NBA champion, has been on the road for a couple of weeks already, getting their individual work in at a pre-camp of sorts in Fort Myers, Florida. The Raptors couldn\u2019t get their pre-Disney work in at home because of travel restrictions that would have applied to players coming into Canada from the U.S. Raptors coach Nick Nurse said his players haven\u2019t dreaded the 1-on-0 work that they\u2019ve been limited to so far, saying his team has approached these weeks with \u201cgreat professionalism\u201d and that his plans for Disney are fairly loose right now. \u201cI don\u2019t really know where we\u2019re at,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI can see individually. I think we look really good. But, what will that translate to when we get back into, you know, calling plays and running defenses and doing some things? \u2026 I know that I\u2019m sensing they really want to play basketball.\u201d The Los Angeles Lakers arrive at Disney on Thursday, and while coach Frank Vogel isn\u2019t looking forward to weeks and potentially months away from his family, he believes the individual workouts have gotten the Western Conference leaders ready. He said those solo sessions have been designed in large part to get players back into some sort of practice shape, with the hope of being able to hit the ground running when everyone can finally be together again at Disney. \u201cWe just want it to be as high as possible to minimize risk of injury and just further the conditioning along as much as we can,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cSo, guys have been able to work pretty diligently the last few days or so. And, you know, we\u2019re looking forward to wrapping this up and getting on that plane.\u201d"},{"id":27178,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/denver-nuggets-name-calvin-booth-gm-official-release","date":"2020-07-07","title":"Nuggets promote Calvin Booth to general manager","content":"DENVER \u2013 The Denver Nuggets have named Calvin Booth as General Manager, President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly announced today. \u201cCalvin is one of the brightest basketball minds in our league,\u201d said Connelly. \u201cWe are very fortunate to have him as part of our organization and are extremely excited for his new role.\u201d Booth, 44, is in his third season with the Nuggets after being hired as Assistant General Manager in the summer of 2017.

Beal is out because of a right rotator cuff injury; Dinwiddie announced that he is still testing positive for coronavirus and won\u2019t participate. Washington, Orlando and Brooklyn are the three teams left in the chase for the final two playoff spots in the East. If the Wizards finish within four games of whichever club finishes eighth, then two games will be played to determine the No. 8 seed. \u201cHe\u2019s worked religiously to get this thing back to where it feels right, and it just hasn\u2019t felt right,\u201d said Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard, who doesn\u2019t believe Beal\u2019s injury will linger long term or require surgery. \u201cTo hear him say himself that he\u2019s just not right right now, \u2018I\u2019ve got to keep working, I\u2019ve got more work to do,\u2019 made that decision much easier.\u201d Washington will also be without forward Davis Bertans, who decided to opt out of playing as a pending free agent, and injured guard John Wall . With Beal and Bertans out, a Wizards team that has been without Wall all season will have to replace more than 40 points per game if it is to somehow get into that postseason mix. \u201cGoing to Orlando is very important \u2014 it\u2019s a very big opportunity \u2014 but would it make sense if we went there and Bradley\u2019s injured?\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cLet\u2019s say our next season starts in December, who\u2019s to say he\u2019s ready for next season? We\u2019re trying to mitigate risk and give him the best opportunity to have a great year next year, which is better for him obviously, for us obviously big picture.\u201d Beal averaged 30.5 points a game this season, almost twice as much as Bertans, the Wizards\u2019 No. 2 scorer. The 27-year-old was preparing to play, even while the decision was up in the air. \u201cI was loving my game this year and how I was playing towards the end of the year,\u201d Beal said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s more or less going to be a decision that comes down to the medical staff and I, just because of our precautions and just coming back from being zero to 100. Then I had some nagging stuff at the end of the year we\u2019re trying to clean up, too.\u201d That team said that was shoulder discomfort Beal experienced early in the season and it worsened over time. The decision to hold him out of play at Walt Disney World was made in consultation with chief of athletic care and performance Daniel Medina, orthopedist Dr. Wiemi Douoguih, Beal and his representatives. \u201cThis was a difficult decision and one that I did not take lightly as the leader of this team,\u201d Beal said in a statement. \u201cI wanted to help my teammates compete for a playoff spot in Orlando but also understand that this will be best for all of us in the long term.\u201d At least six players on the Nets have tested positive for the virus. But Brooklyn general manager said last week there was no discussion of the team not traveling to Florida for the resumption of the NBA season. Dinwiddie joined Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving aren\u2019t coming back, DeAndre Jordan and Wilson Chandler among the Nets players not participating. \u201cAfter another positive test yesterday and considering the symptoms, (the Nets), team doctors and I have decided that it would be in the best interest for me and the team that I do not play in Orlando,\u201d Dinwiddie wrote on Twitter. \u201cI will be supporting the guys every step of the way!\u201d Beal\u2019s absence also all-but clinches the NBA scoring title for Houston\u2019s James Harden, who would be mathematically assured of staying ahead of Beal by scoring a total of 12 points in the seeding games. If Harden sits out any of Houston\u2019s last eight games, that would also be enough to ensure his average \u2014 34.4 points per game \u2014 does not fall below Beal. Beal becomes the second player in NBA history to average at least 30 points in a season where he was not an All-Star. The other was Utah\u2019s Adrian Dantley, who averaged 30.7 points in 1982-83.

The decision was made in full consultation with Wizards Chief of Athlete Care & Performance Daniel Medina, Wizards Orthopedist Dr. Wiemi Douoguih, Beal and his representation. \u201cBradley did everything possible to be ready to play, but after closely monitoring his individual workouts we came to the conclusion that it was best for him to sit out the upcoming games in Orlando and avoid the risk of further injury,\u201d said Wizards General Manager Tommy Sheppard. \u201cAlthough he was able to play through the majority of the season with the injury, the layoff from March until now did not leave any of us feeling comfortable that he would have enough time to be ready to perform at the extremely high level we are all accustomed to seeing and agreed that not participating in the games in Orlando was the right decision.\u201d Beal experienced discomfort with his shoulder early in the season and worked with the team\u2019s medical and performance staff to manage the injury. The symptoms worsened over the course of the hiatus and he began to rehabilitate the injury with the intent of returning to play. He will not travel with the team to Orlando and will continue his rehabilitation process over the summer. \u201cThis was a difficult decision and one that I did not take lightly as the leader of this team,\u201d said Beal. \u201cI wanted to help my teammates compete for a playoff spot in Orlando, but also understand that this will be best for all of us in the long term. I appreciate the support of my teammates, the fans and the entire organization and look forward to returning next season to continue the progress we have made.\u201d At the postponement of the season on March 12, Beal was averaging 30.5 points per game (to go along with a career-high 6.1 assists), trailing only James Harden\u2019s 36.7 points per game. He also led the NBA in points per game since January 1 at 33.6. Beal tallied back-to-back 50-point nights on February 23 (53 at Chicago) and 24 (55 vs. Milwaukee), becoming just the sixth player in NBA history with back-to-back 50-point nights and the first since Kobe Bryant in 2007. Beal has recorded 50 20-plus-point games, 31 30-plus-point games, 10 40-plus-point games and two 50-plus-point games, placing him in the top three in the league in each category. With his current averages of 30.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 45.5% shooting from the field, Beal joins Stephen Curry, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Michael Jordan as the only players to post averages of at least 30.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game on 45.0% or better shooting in a single season since 1975. Beal scored 25-or-more points in 21-straight games from January 20 \u2013 March 6, the longest streak in franchise history and the second-longest NBA streak in the last 10 seasons. During the streak, Beal passed Jeff Malone for second place on the franchise\u2019s all-time scoring list."},{"id":27216,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/season-restart-home-court-advantage-no-more","date":"2020-07-07","title":"How Orlando's neutral site will impact teams, referees and games","content":" After a virus-driven layoff that has had the NBA and millions of its fans sheltering at home for months, it\u2019s ironic that \u2014 in the league\u2019s planned July 30 restart in Orlando \u2014 none of the involved players, coaches or teams will be home at all. The \u201cbubble\u201d strategy that the league will deploy to salvage what it can of the 2019-20 season and playoffs will play out entirely at the Walt Disney World Resort complex in central Florida. Twenty-two teams will play a total of 88 \u201cseeding games,\u201d with the top 16 ultimately advancing to the traditional playoff format to crown the next NBA champion. All games will be played in one of several arenas on the Disney campus. None will offer any sort of home-court advantage. None will force a team to play in front of a hostile road crowd, either. In fact, there will be no crowds at all. \u201cFans\u201d will only arrive when family and friends are admitted into the \u201cbubble\u201d after the first round, by which time only eight teams will remain. Thus, what has been a cornerstone of the pro sports championship will be conspicuously absent. Packed and partisan arenas, boisterous spectators, goofy mascots, rousing music, unofficial replay judges? Gone. Every bit of it.  Home atmosphere, comfort zones, ingrained routines, game-ops cleverness will all be missing, too. That\u2019s just too bad for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers, the teams who led the Eastern and Western Conference, respectively, before the season hiatus. Too bad, too, for the Philadelphia 76ers, who drew most of their mojo this season from their Wells Fargo Center home court (29-2) while sputtering elsewhere (10-24). Too bad even for the team that actually calls Orlando home. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be 30 minutes away from home,\u201d said Magic general manager John Hammond, \u201cbut we might as well be in Los Angeles.\u201d Once the Magic enter the bubble, like the other 21 teams, there will be no coming out until they\u2019ve either been eliminated or soaked with champagne (in what looms as the loneliest Larry O\u2019Brien trophy presentation ever). \u201cThis is going to be the neutral-site effect that everybody\u2019s wondered about,\u201d said Detroit coach Dwane Casey, whose Pistons won\u2019t be participating in the restart. \u201cNow you\u2019ll all be on equal footing.\u201d That\u2019s one way to spin it: nothing getting in the way of talent, Xs & Os and a certain endurance. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of mental toughness to stay focused,\u201d Casey said. \u201cDifferent environment, uncharted territory as far as your routine and your rhythm. It should be summertime but here you\u2019re playing basketball.\u201d Stripping away so much from what typically defines the NBA might reveal something positive, Turner Sports analyst Stan Van Gundy said.  \u201cIt will be, in some ways, just pure basketball,\u201d said Van Gundy, who coached 12 seasons in the NBA. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be the emotion or adrenaline of a crowd to get people going. It will come down to each guy\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d Pure basketball or sterile basketball? As with so much of the logistics, that\u2019s TBD as teams spend tons more time together than on even the most grueling, traditional NBA road trip. Opponents will be unnaturally nearby throughout, scattered across three Disney hotels for the duration of the operation. No airport buses, no TSA checkpoints, no charter flights delivering them across time zones in the wee hours after games. No entertainment outside the \u201cbubble,\u201d according to the guidelines. No hugging of one\u2019s kids, no cruising around in cars made possible by NBA salaries. This will be a combination of \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d basketball heavy interspersed with golf, ping-pong (singles only), card games and lots of Zoom. Nobody\u2019s idea of a home away from home, off the court or on. Before we plunge fully into the challenge of playing without home-court advantage this summer, it\u2019s worth addressing the chicken-or-egg aspect of this. As in: Does home court really help teams win? Or do the best teams invariably end up with home-court advantage in the process of winning, whether they need it or not? It is possible we\u2019ve had it backwards, and teams good enough to win championships in the first place earned the home court by asserting that goodness \u2014 and talent, depth, coaching and experience \u2014 along the way. Maybe a high percentage of them would have won anyway, even if it meant grinding through round after round when they only had three home games rather than four.  \u201cI think it\u2019s both,\u201d Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cIn a seven-game series, usually it\u2019s the best team that\u2019s going to win. If you took Milwaukee against Brooklyn and turned around the home court, it would give Brooklyn a better chance. But I\u2019d still take Milwaukee. They\u2019re the better team. \u201cBut as you start getting to the true contenders and everybody\u2019s good, it changes. You might get a Lakers-Milwaukee series where the difference is minimal. Now the home court matters.\u201d In NFL point spreads, being at home is worth three points. It\u2019s not as formal in the NBA, but in Van Gundy\u2019s view, it is very much is real. \u201cYou have your guys in their comfort zones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you play most of your games. Your routine is very comfortable. Certainly the crowd helps you at times, especially when you go on runs. Meanwhile it\u2019s the complete reverse for the other team. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking a 10- or 12-point advantage. It\u2019s probably a bucket or two. But a lot of games between really good teams get decided by a bucket or two.\u201d Hall of Famer Kevin McHale was a member of the 1985-86 Boston Celtics that set the NBA mark for best home record (40-1, matched by the 2015-16 San Antonio Spurs). Their confidence was sky high \u2014 they went 27-14 on the road, too \u2014 and McHale learned the value of going home, if only as a rabbit\u2019s foot or palate cleanser. \u201cIn a series, you always have \u2018We\u2019re going home. We can get it tied up,\u2019\u201d McHale said. \u201cThere\u2019s always that thought, even if it starts with you down 0-2, you can get home where you\u2019ve been solid all year. You always have something to tell the team, as the coach. \u201cBut man, to tell them, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re coming right back here tomorrow. There\u2019s nobody in the stands, there\u2019s nobody cheering. But sure, we\u2019ll play better!\u2019 You won\u2019t have a chance to change the flow. It\u2019s going to be odd.\u201d Home-court advantage gets most of its attention in the playoffs, especially in Game 7 road winners. In 72 years of The Finals, snagging the clincher on the other guys\u2019 floor has been a massive achievement, occurring just four times. Across all seven-game NBA playoff series, it has happened only 28 times. Since 1984, when the NBA went to its current 16-team format, teams seeded No. 1 have won 23 of the 36 championships. Teams seeded No. 2 have snagged another eight. Those seeds enjoyed home-court advantage at least for two rounds, often four. But the regular season is home-court dominant too. Season after season, teams playing at home win close to 60% of the time. In the five seasons from 2014-15 through 2018-19, for example, their combined winning percentage was .583. Going back further and sampling it differently, looking at the five seasons (10 years apart) from 1969-70 through 2009-10, home teams won at a .616 clip. \u201cI\u2019m not as big a believer in home court as \u2018the fans driving you for 48 minutes to victory,\u2019\u201d said ABC\/ESPN analyst Jeff Van Gundy. \u201cI think you have to do your part as a team. Then in the last four minutes, I think they can make a difference with their passion and their intensity to drive you for a few possessions to higher heights. But you\u2019ve got to do the work. \u201cIt will be the same in these games \u2014 you just won\u2019t have those last four minutes.\u201d Hammond felt likewise, seeing home court as a factor early in games. \u201cOnce it gets down to crunch time and it\u2019s \u2018win or lose\u2019 circumstances,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters to most guys where they play.\u201d Flip the whole thing and there might even be teams that miss the challenge of legit road games, with their jeering and uphill battles. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Casey said, \u201cbut I think I like coaching on the road better. You\u2019re more focused. You\u2019ve got that underdog mentality, with everybody against you.\u201d Searching for precedents isn\u2019t easy. The NBA had a tradition of staging some games on neutral courts and, in fact, still does when it sends teams to play internationally. But those were and are generally one-offs. You almost must reach back to the defunct Orlando Summer League to find games played in gyms without fans. Other NBA personnel were the only folks allowed in the bleachers there. \u201cI go back to the old L.A. summer league or maybe the Vegas league when it started,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cEarly on, there were just enough people in the crowd where you could hear everything that was said. I felt bad for those officials working those games.\u201d  One of the oddest aspects of the restart will be this: What drove teams through those first 60-plus games from October into March \u2014 securing home court for as many playoff series as possible \u2014 has vanished. Jockeying for position in the eight seeding games might matter for matchups or just qualifying. But landing one of the top four seeds as opposed to five or lower? Meh.  \u201cI\u2019ll be interested to see how teams use those eight games,\u201d Jeff Van Gundy said. \u201cDo they play to win? Do they play everybody 20-some minutes like it\u2019s preseason, and then build their minutes up so they\u2019re ready for the first round of the playoffs? \u201cTo me, of the 22 teams, for 13 of them \u2014 the top seven in the West and the top six in the East \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t matter what they do in those games.\u201d His brother concurred. \u201cI\u2019m not criticizing the plan, because there was no way around it, but the value of the regular season has been lost,\u201d Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cI feel badly for teams like Milwaukee or the Lakers who took care of business all season long to be able to play on their home courts, and it\u2019s now rendered absolutely meaningless.\u201d One possible upside? The possibility of lower seeds prevailing in four out of seven games has never been greater, according to these experts. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater chance for upsets this year, not just for home court,\u201d Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cThere also has been this big, long layoff, with nobody being in a rhythm. \u201cA team like Dallas, that is pretty damn good anyway, let\u2019s say they\u2019re the seventh seed. If Rick [Carlisle, Mavericks coach] decides to really amp them up and have them really ready to go, in mid-season form and conditioning when that first playoff series opens up \u2014 against somebody who maybe has taken a slower approach \u2014 could Dallas jump them? \u201cThe Clippers, say, won\u2019t have the home court working for them.\u201d This layoff will be the equivalent of a standard offseason. The playoffs this summer will be like starting a normal first-round in November. \u201cYou want your team really ready to go when the playoffs start,\u201d Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cBut you have to read your team \u2014 you can\u2019t ramp them up faster than they\u2019re ready to go, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this. The experience coaches have in getting teams ready to play is out the window \u2014 this is something none of them has dealt with.\u201d Trying to simulate home-court advantage by other means, some of which have been floated speculatively \u2014 awarding the ball at the start of each quarter to the team that would have been at home or allowing seven fouls for a team\u2019s designated player \u2014 was met with resistance and seen as too gimmicky from the folks contacted for this story. Every NBA coach knows what it\u2019s like to play an important road game. You navigate the travel hurdles, look into your players\u2019 eyes to see if they\u2019re ready for the challenge \u2026 and then you look at the bottom of the lineup sheet, where the game officials are listed. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s important when you\u2019re on the road is the officials,\u201d Casey said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have officials who have a \u2018screw you\u2019 attitude. If you saw Joey Crawford, Steve Javie, Monty McCutchen, those guys on the road, you knew you were gonna get a fair shake. Some refs have a gene to go against a crowd.\u201d When it comes to filtering out home crowds, all referees are not created equal. No matter what the league\u2019s lofty ideal is. Even McCutchen, now the NBA\u2019s vice president of referee training and development, will tell you that. Others see it. \u201cI say this diplomatically,\u201d Stan Van Gundy said, \u201cbut there is a little bit of an advantage [at home] with the referees too. Of course they\u2019ll say there\u2019s not. But there\u2019s a human nature element. If we think the players are affected by the home court a little bit, is it unreasonable to think that that referees are affected by the crowd a little bit? \u201cMaybe they only get caught up in it for one call or two calls. Those plays can make a difference. I firmly believe we have the best referees in the world. Still\u2026\u201d That suggests referees might benefit from getting home crowds off their backs. For them, the Orlando \u201cbubble\u201d really could offer something resembling a basketball lab, particularly in games before families and friends are admitted. If, that is, they can handle the dramatically different acoustics of basketball-only gyms. Jeff Van Gundy mentioned the practice of \u201cselective hearing,\u201d by which an official can cut an unhappy coach or player some slack on his objections because crowd noise masks what\u2019s being said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that tool is available now for officials,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the fan at home can hear as it comes through the microphones, you\u2019re going to have to make some decisions that before, maybe you let go. Now you can\u2019t.\u201d Even Javie, the longtime ref now working as a rules analyst for ABC\/ESPN, agreed with that. \u201cI wonder if the league is going to ask the referees for a little more restraint. I don\u2019t think so\u201d Javie said. \u201cIf I was a boss and over the air heard someone give you a mouthful of expletives and you didn\u2019t take care of business? It might expose some referees.\u201d Javie, in giving a ref\u2019s view of games without crowds, acknowledged the difference between a hostile arena and one that\u2019s milder or lacking fans altogether. \u201cMe, personally, I didn\u2019t give a damn, even when there were 18,000 people screaming \u2018Javie sucks!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOfficials who take care of business won\u2019t be affected. This will not be like a Summer League game. These teams are coming to win. \u201cUsually when an official walks on the floor in the playoffs, and especially The Finals, you feel the electricity from the fans buzzing. So you might not feel that. But you can also get it off the players, too. The more important the game is, it seems like in the layup lines, the more intensity you see on the players\u2019 faces.\u201d Differences from the usual product will abound. Will players talk more on defense because they\u2019ll be able to hear each other? Will coaches dial down their volume to suit the surroundings? No home. No road. Just an eternal neutral court. And that\u2019s all before the first positive test for coronavirus in the thick of a playoff series. This isn\u2019t just a high-wire act, Stan Van Gundy said, it\u2019s \u201ca trapeze artist whose net has holes in it, and you just hope when he falls he hits the net and doesn\u2019t go through one of the holes.\u201d \u201cThe whole thing is going to be really fascinating to watch,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve never seen anything like it. The NBA didn\u2019t have the option to have it be the same as always. So they\u2019re trying to do the best they can in a difficult circumstance. \u201cBut the referees we\u2019ve got are the best, the players are the best, the coaches are the best.

He also wants to see the league go further with some of those plans as it prepares to restart the season later this month in Florida. One of the Celtics\u2019 young stars, the 23-year-old has been one of the most outspoken voices among players since the NBA paused its season in March. From encouraging young Americans to take COVID-19 seriously, to driving 15 hours from Boston in May to lead a protest march in the days after the release of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis, Brown has actively used social media to raise awareness on several fronts to his more than 1.6 million followers on Twitter and Instagram. http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CBTKowFFDoo\/?utm_source While he said Monday that he initially considered not playing in Orlando because of the pandemic and family concerns, he ultimately decided the opportunity to amplify his voice on the NBA\u2019s worldwide stage won out. \u201cOnce I thought about the opportunity that the organization and the NBA presented to play for something bigger than myself, I was signed up,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan on using my voice while I\u2019m down there. I plan on spreading light on things that are getting dimmed and hopefully the NBA and our organization can understand.\u201d Brown\u2019s heavily involved with National Basketball Players Association as a member the executive committee and said he\u2019s encouraged by the open dialogue among players and the NBA leadership\u2019s attentiveness to the union\u2019s concerns. That has included allowing an option for players to opt out of playing in Orlando. Lakers guard Avery Bradley and Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving, who have been vocal leaders of a players\u2019 coalition that has sought to keep a focus on social justice and racial equality issues, are among a handful of players who are sitting out the Orlando restart. Bradley made his decision out of concerns for his son with a history of respiratory illnesses and Irving because of injury. Last month the league announced a pledge to devote resources to helping players promote social justice causes. Those initiatives will include painting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on the courts at Disney Wide World of Sports. And while players who decided to opt out of playing in Orlando won\u2019t be paid for the games they missed, they won\u2019t face discipline from their teams. \u201cAt the end of the day, Black Lives Matter and Black athletes\u2019 lives matter as well,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI respect any guy\u2019s decision. My decision was to play just because I felt like it\u2019s bigger than me and it\u2019s bigger than my family and it\u2019s bigger than all of us. People have died for the opportunity to be able to shed light and speak on certain causes. The least I could do is play basketball.\u201d But Brown also is in agreement with Philadelphia 76ers forward Mike Scott that the NBA\u2019s plan to only allow players to chose messages from a league-approved list to put on the back of their jerseys is disappointing. \u201cI think that list is an example of a form of limitations,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think we should be able to express our struggle just a little bit more.\u201d He\u2019s hopeful there\u2019s still time for that to happen. \u201cThe bottom line is there are improvements that need to be made,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe NBA has a great voice, a lot of resources and a lot of influence. We\u2019re appreciative that they\u2019re helping and aiding in a lot of those things that we care about.

I don\u2019t want to hoop, I don\u2019t want to work out, I don\u2019t want to play 2K, I don\u2019t want do anything with basketball.\u201d Thanks to a call from the Los Angeles Lakers, Smith is getting another shot on basketball\u2019s biggest stage. He joined the Western Conference leaders for workouts last week before they head to Florida for the conclusion of the NBA season. The 34-year-old Smith was added to the roster because Lakers starter Avery Bradley declined to return for the rest of the season, citing family concerns. The Lakers needed a depth replacement who could immediately fit in alongside LeBron James while playing solid wing defense, providing a 3-point threat and meshing quickly as a teammate. Nobody in recent NBA history fits that job description more perfectly than Smith, who reached four NBA Finals and won the 2016 title while playing alongside James in Cleveland. Known for his ebullient behavior on and off the court, Smith was overjoyed to get back in the show. \u201cI was gone for a while,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBeing somebody who has been around the league predominantly for most of their adult life, when that\u2019s taken away from you, it kind of gives you that culture shock. You obviously don\u2019t understand what you\u2019ve lost until it\u2019s gone. I just want to appreciate the moment for what it is, and whether it be next year or never again, I just want to enjoy every possible moment that I get.\u201d Smith tried out for the Lakers in February when they had another roster spot available, but the team chose veteran Dion Waiters for that slot. Waiters never got to play for Los Angeles before the season was suspended, and now both veterans are headed to Orlando with the Lakers. Coach Frank Vogel was impressed by the way Smith kept himself in shape despite being without a team for an extended period. \u201cI think this is really a great story,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWhen you look at a guy who could potentially be out of the league and was a starter on a Finals team a couple years back, a champion, for him to have the perseverance to stay ready and give himself this opportunity, I think is to be commended.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to tell whether Smith will get significant playing time behind Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Alex Caruso, who are likely to fill the majority of Bradley\u2019s minutes. But Smith\u2019s particular set of skills is exactly what the Lakers sought \u2014 particularly his career 37.3% shooting on 3-pointers. With James setting up Anthony Davis as their primary scoring option, the Lakers have plenty of opportunities for well-spaced shooters to get open looks. \u201cHey, his nickname is \u2018Swish\u2019 for a reason, right?\u201d Vogel said of Smith. \u201cHe\u2019s a shot-maker, a big-time shot-maker. I think he\u2019s really going to help us.\u201d Smith is also uncommonly familiar with James, and he knows what to do when LeBron\u2019s competitiveness ramps up in the postseason. Smith and James have played together for years in the NBA\u2019s most difficult situations \u2014 and this time, they won\u2019t have to face the Golden State Warriors. \u201cThere\u2019s people that are not going to know how to deal with it,\u201d Smith said of James\u2019 competitiveness. \u201cIt comes off in the wrong way sometimes, and you need that bridge as a player to be able to go to the next player and be like, \u2018Listen man, it\u2019s nothing personal. (It\u2019s not about) who was right, who was wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s just a good balance, I think, between myself and him, because he knows just as well he can challenge anybody else, I\u2019ll challenge him, and vice versa.\u201d"},{"id":27212,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/players-work-out-coaches-roundup","date":"2020-07-06","title":"NBA players work out with coaches as restart looms","content":" NBA players returned to team practice facilities recently for individual workouts in preparation for the Season Restart in Orlando .

(AP) \u2014 Grieving the death of a cousin and missing his mother, Damian Lillard struggled emotionally after the NBA shut down because of the coronavirus. But he also found inspiration in his activism for Black Lives Matter and his flourishing music career. The Trail Blazers were just out of the playoff picture, sitting ninth in the Western Conference standings on March 11 when the league was shuttered. The team will be among 22 that will depart next week for Orlando as part of the re-start . Portland will have eight games to secure a playoff berth, starting on July 31 with Memphis. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to ease our way in, we don\u2019t have time to try and figure stuff out, we\u2019ve got to come in assertive and aggressive and just go after it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we fail, we fail, but we gotta at least come out there with that mentality of we don\u2019t have time to kind of ease into it.\u201d Lillard welcomes the chance to resume playing after a difficult few months. He admittedly had no idea how serious the virus was when the league closed down. He went to Phoenix with his family, intent on finding a gym to stay in shape during the layoff. But the NBA said players couldn\u2019t go to third-party facilities or trainers because of health concerns. While grateful that he had his fiance and son with him, Lillard essentially sheltered in place once he got back to Portland. He didn\u2019t see his mom for more than a month. And then his cousin and personal chef, Brandon Johnson, suddenly passed away. \u201cIt was tough, man. I think that was when I got to the point where I was like, if I was waking up and it wasn\u2019t a sunny day, it was messing with my mood. It was just tough,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cI got through it, just from having a lot of my family around. That really helped. So I can see why somebody who is with one person or by themselves would have a really hard time. Definitely a tough few months.\u201d Always diligent about his fitness, Lillard found a way to train. Then George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, touching off nationwide protests over police brutality. Lillard marched in Portland. He also released a powerful rap \u201cBlacklist,\u2033 under his music persona, Dame D.O.L.L.A. \u201cI grew up with Oscar Grant, who was killed at a BART station while handcuffed facedown. I\u2019ve been racially profiled by cops, before I was in the NBA. So I have thoughts and feelings about this stuff. That\u2019s what Blacklist was about,\u201d he said. Lillard was averaging 28.9 points and 7.8 assists this season. In January he scored 61 points in a game against the Warriors and he had seven games with 40 or more points. He\u2019ll be among those sequestered at Disney\u2019s Wide World of Sports Complex for games, but the resumption of the season comes as cases of COVID-19 are spiking in Florida. Some players have opted out, including Portland\u2019s Trevor Ariza and Caleb Swanigan. But Portland will see the return of big men Jusuf Nurkic, now recovered from a broken leg last season, and Zach Collins, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury. One thing that\u2019s not a concern for the Blazers is fitness. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very diligent about taking care of themselves, both in the weight room and on the court, and treatment. So I\u2019ve been very impressed with all of their conditioning,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cThey\u2019re not an NBA game shape yet, but I think with a month to go, with the practices that we\u2019re going to have, and the way they\u2019ve taken care of themselves so far, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch that they\u2019ll be more than ready.\u201d Lillard is confident in his own ability to stay healthy, but he doesn\u2019t quite trust everyone else. The NBA announced this week that nine additional players had tested positive for the virus, bringing the total of league players who have contracted it to 25. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s still a possibility for something to spread within that bubble, just with there been so many people and so many different things that we\u2019ve got to follow to be safe, even though we\u2019re not exposed to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for me, it\u2019s gonna be, `What time is practice? What time can I get in the weight room, What time can I get some shots up? What\u2019s the plan for game day?\u2032 I\u2019m going to be in the room. I\u2019m going to have my PS3, my PS4. I\u2019m going to have my studio equipment, my mike, my laptop. I\u2019m going to have all my books. I mean, that\u2019s it.

The Pelicans guard will be living in the NBA\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d when 22 teams gather near Orlando, Florida, this month to resume their suspended season. Holiday\u2019s wife, Lauren, a former U.S. national team soccer player, is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child at a time when much of society has been shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. The veteran New Orleans player might be away from home for more than a month. Meanwhile, Memphis rookie Ja Morant expects to miss his daughter\u2019s first birthday next month. Boston\u2019s Gordon Hayward may leave the team when his fourth child is born in September. And players like Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal and Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard wonder how intense NBA restrictions on player movement will be received. These are but a few examples of why the NBA, its teams and the players\u2019 union are making mental health and wellness resources available to players now and once they arrive at Disney\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex. \u201cIt is going to leave the guys with a lot of time on their own, and challenges with families, newborns and whatever else they have going on in their personal lives are going to be magnified because they\u2019re going to be in confined spaces for prolonged periods of time,\u201d said William Parham, a Loyola Marymount psychology professor and director of the National Basketball Players Association\u2019s mental health and wellness program. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it, so I would anticipate some increased anxiety, some increased tension, some increased restlessness.\u201d There will be no fans at Disney. There also will be restrictions on where players can go, plus rules keeping families away until at least the second round of the playoffs. The hope is to significantly limit exposure to COVID-19 inside the bubble. Even under normal circumstances, Holiday sees family time as a cherished respite. Life at Disney will clearly complicate that. \u201cThis is one of the mental parts about it that guys have to adjust to, where someone like me, I go home and it\u2019s where I kind of relax,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cI try my best not to bring my work home with me so I can hang out with my wife, my dog, and my daughter and I can do things like that. \u2026 I think that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a challenge, especially after like seven to 10 days.\u201d Likewise, Beal said living in the bubble will hardly be \u201ca walk in the park.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave. We can\u2019t just order whatever food we want. We can\u2019t just do activities we want to do. We can\u2019t go to our teammates\u2019 rooms,\u201d Beal said. \u201cYou\u2019re restricted, and you can\u2019t do the things that you\u2019re normally used to doing.\u201d The Pelicans\u2019 mental health and wellness program is led by team psychologist Jenna Rosen, and New Orleans general manager David Griffin calls it \u201ccritical.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves. This quarantine situation is going to be very difficult,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe will work through mindfulness training with Jenna literally every day. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be about who can keep themselves in the best frame of mind, quite frankly.\u201d Mental health has been a priority for the NBA and the NBPA, especially after players like Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love and San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan opened up about their inner struggles. DeRozan knows it won\u2019t be easy at Disney. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking guys who\u2019ve been with their families every single day for the last few months and all of a sudden separating everybody into this one confined space and taking away a lot of joyful things that we do outside of basketball.\u201d Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, who has played for Greece\u2019s national team, said being away for three weeks during international tournaments was challenging. This trip to Disney could last three months if the Bucks make the NBA Finals. \u201cNot being able to see your family, being there for three months, playing games with no fans, it\u2019s going to be mental,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to push yourself through this.\u201d Daniel Medina, the Wizards\u2019 chief of athletic care and performance, said some players are concerned that an interrupted season might make them more prone to injury, which could be career-altering to players with expiring contracts. Some have decided not to play, notably Indiana\u2019s Victor Oladipo. Parham, who helped launch the NBPA\u2019s mental health program in 2018, expects many players to handle the resumption well. He noted that after three months of relative isolation at home, they\u2019ll be eager to satisfy their appetite for competition. Still, the unprecedented nature of the bubble, born out of a pandemic blamed for about a half-million deaths worldwide, will present challenges. Another issue, Parham said, is how the restart coincides with the political and social upheaval spawned by the death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in police custody. \u201cPrior to COVID, and prior to these social justice demonstrations, there were sufficient daily distractions for people to not really even think about their stuff. They were just sort of on automatic pilot,\u201d Parham said. \u201cYou know what they say: A person will never see their reflection in running water. It is only when the water is still that their reflected image begins to emerge.\u201d"},{"id":27173,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-shamet-tests-positive-coronavirus","date":"2020-07-04","title":"Report: Landry Shamet tests positive for coronavirus","content":" LA Clippers guard Landry Shamet is \u201cunlikely\u201d to travel with the team to Orlando this week after testing positive for the coronavirus, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Saturday. https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShamsCharania\/status\/1279461121670463488 https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShamsCharania\/status\/1279461121670463488 Shamet is the Clippers\u2019 fifth-leading scorer at 9.7 points per game.

Utah center Rudy Gobert is still standing tall, after all that and more. Plenty of eyes will be on Gobert when the NBA season, the one that shut down March 11 when he became the first player in the league to be diagnosed with the coronavirus, takes a giant step toward returning by having teams gather at the Disney complex in Central Florida over the next few days. The Jazz will be a fascinating case study during this restart, particularly regarding whether or not Gobert and Donovan Mitchell \u2014 a fellow All-Star who was diagnosed with the virus shortly after the shutdown began and did not hide his anger with Gobert about it all \u2014 can coexist peacefully again. \u201cI\u2019m happy now. I\u2019m in a good place, you know,\u201d Gobert told reporters Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy that I get the joy back from playing basketball with my team and the competitiveness is back. I\u2019m ready to try to go out there and try to win the championship. That\u2019s the goal. And to be honest, after everything we\u2019ve been through as a team and as human beings, it would be a great comeback.\u201d Gobert answered questions for about 11 minutes. He talked about the relationship with Mitchell. (\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be perfect,\u201d he said, acknowledging strains that have been no secret.) He talked about the potential of signing a lucrative extension \u2014 he\u2019s supermax-eligible \u2014 with the Jazz, which could happen before next season. (\u201cI don\u2019t plan on leaving right now,\u201d he said.) He talked about his recovery from the virus, which is ongoing, at least in how his sense of smell hasn\u2019t totally recovered. (\u201cSmelling, I took that for granted too. It\u2019s back now, it\u2019s back at 80%, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said.) He spoke softly, calmly, thoughtfully. And even though he is the two-time reigning Kia Defensive Player of The Year, he didn\u2019t swat any question away. \u201cObviously, when you have the whole world judging you and threatening you or sending you a lot of negative energy and stuff like that, it\u2019s something that I would say is not easy as a human being,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cBut at the same time, people just judge you on the perception they have and the perception they get. Sometimes it can be one picture, one video, one interview, one action.\u201d In this case, that\u2019s pretty much exactly what happened. A picture, a video, an interview, an action. It was the start of the downfall. It was the morning of March 9: Before leaving a media session at shootaround in Salt Lake City on Monday in advance of a game against Detroit, Gobert touched all the tape recorders that were placed before him on a table, devices that reporters who cover the Jazz were using. He meant it as a joke. When he tested positive two days later, it was no laughing matter. The Jazz were in Oklahoma City, just moments away from starting a game against the Thunder, when word came that Gobert tested positive. The game was called off. The season was suspended that same night. Just like that, Gobert was a center of negative attention. \u201cFirst of all, you make sure he\u2019s OK,\u201d said Orlando guard Evan Fournier, a fellow French national-team player, who reached out often to check on Gobert. \u201cYou know, you call him and once we\u2019re on the phone or just talking, text, whatever, you just ask him a few questions. How is he feeling, blah, blah, blah. And then once he starts to open up and say things about how he sees the whole situation, then you just try to give your best judgment to him. And you know, that\u2019s what I did.\u201d Gobert immediately started trying to show remorse. He donated $200,000 to a fund established to help those who work part-time at Jazz games, people who lost income because contests were canceled. More money \u2014 about $310,000 \u2014 went to families affected by the pandemic in Utah and Oklahoma City, plus in his native France. He taped a public-service announcement for the league. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to control everyone\u2019s perception of me, but I can control my actions,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cI can control, you know, the things I do for the people around me, for the community, the things I do for my teammates on the court, off the court. All that stuff, I can control and that\u2019s what really matters to me.\u201d For his part, Mitchell said the relationship with Gobert has improved. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re good,\u201d Mitchell said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going out there ready to hoop.\u201d The Jazz have secured a playoff berth.

That\u2019s when he realized a bright side of the NBA\u2019s coronavirus shutdown. The injured guys weren\u2019t injured anymore. Plenty of aches and pains around the NBA have healed in the almost-four-month span since the league had to suspend its season because of the pandemic, which means the 22 teams that will be arriving at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida next week should be coming in with mostly healthy rosters. Keeping players healthy once they get to Disney will be another challenge, as workloads ramp up quickly for the July 30 resumption of games \u2014 but, at least at the start of camps for the resumed season, rosters will be deeper than they were when the league shut down on March 11. \u201cI hate to even use that term, like a \u2018silver lining\u2019 came out of this because this is something that nobody ever predicted,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to say good things came from it.\u201d Fact is, though, some good things have emerged on the injury fronts. After 60 or 65 games, most players were likely dealing with some sort of aches-and-pains issue anyway. Miami\u2019s Meyers Leonard was in a race against time just to get back for what would have been the April start of the playoffs after a horrifically bad sprained ankle, and Heat rookie Tyler Herro had been out with another ankle issue. Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo was dealing with a slight knee sprain when the season was suspended. Dallas\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis was getting some occasional maintenance days for his surgically repaired knee. \u201cThe knee was feeling great the whole time. It was just a matter of me getting back into a rhythm, getting that skill for the game again, that touch around the rim and little things like that,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cI feel like now with the extra time that we had to put in the individual work and get a lot of shots up and keep working on my game, I feel really comfortable on the court. I\u2019ll be really back into my rhythm and into the feel of the game. I\u2019m just ready. I\u2019m ready to be back on the court.\u201d Collins hadn\u2019t played since Oct. 27 because of a left shoulder dislocation that required surgery. Nurkic hasn\u2019t played since March 25, 2019 because of a gruesome injury \u2014 fractures to his tibia and fibula in the left leg. And now the Blazers, who will be fighting to make the Western Conference playoffs, will have a pair of 7-footers back at Disney to bolster those postseason hopes. \u201cThey look great,\u201d Lillard said of Nurkic and Collins. \u201cThey make me feel way more confident going in, both of them. Like I forgot \u2026 I didn\u2019t forget, but I forgot who they were. It\u2019s been so long that I almost forgot.\u201d Nurkic is looking forward to reminding everyone what he was. \u201cI\u2019m healthy as possible,\u201d Nurkic said. While it\u2019s true that players would have preferred to be in rhythm and not have had this much time off, there are plenty who have raved about the benefit of unplanned rest. Boston\u2019s Gordon Hayward said he was able to give his left foot \u2014 which still gets sore from time to time, a residual effect of his awful left ankle fracture in 2017 \u2014 a bit of a break, and Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis said the time off left him feeling completely refreshed. With games coming about every other day at Disney, that time off now is a valuable commodity. \u201cIt\u2019s been good,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a chance to let my body recover, kind of take a midseason break now and just let everything heal and get back to like how I was beginning of the year \u2026 to get back to the best version of myself.

Still, Oladipo was not at 100% and believes opting out of the season restart will give him more time to get there, as well prevent the risk of injuring any soft tissues around his quad tendon. \u201cWe totally respect and understand Victor\u2019s decision,\u201d said President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard in a team statement. \u201cThe first priority for our players is, and always will be, their health, whether that be physical or mental. \u201cThis is not a unique situation for our team, playing without key players,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe remain excited about what they can accomplish in Orlando.\u201d Oladipo still plans to travel to Orlando next week with the rest of his team.

Davis turned 27 on March 11 when the NBA shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic. After a few homebound months spent largely improving his video game skills, Davis is back at work as the Lakers attempt to achieve their interrupted goals. Davis, LeBron James and the Lakers are gathered for individual workouts this week in preparation for their trip to Orlando, where they\u2019re among the favorites to win it all in this extraordinary NBA season. The Lakers (49-14) were leading the Western Conference and preparing for their first playoff run together when everything stopped. Davis still loves the Lakers\u2019 chances of contending for the franchise\u2019s 17th championship. \u201cActually, I think our chances are higher, just because we\u2019re all rested and we\u2019re all ready to go,\u201d Davis said Thursday in his first extensive public comment since March. \u201cIf anything, our chances got higher, and it\u2019s going to be about just who wants it more.\u201d The time off was a particular benefit for Davis, who mostly played through his usual assortment of nagging injuries during his first season after engineering a trade from New Orleans to the Lakers so he could improve his chances of winning a ring. Davis had problems with his elbow, tailbone and shoulder at various points of this season, but they\u2019re all memories now. \u201cIt\u2019s been good for me to let some of the lingering injuries I had toward the time when the NBA stopped kind of recover and heal,\u201d Davis said. \u201d(I can) get back into the best version of myself. I feel 100% healthy. Well, I don\u2019t \u2018feel,\u2019 I am (100% healthy). I feel like I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Davis has played splendidly when healthy for the Lakers, averaging 26.7 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists with 27 double-doubles in 55 games. He also averaged 2.4 blocks while playing stellar defense for one of the NBA\u2019s top defensive teams. \u201cHopefully the best is yet to come,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel, who praised Davis\u2019 ability to play through injury. \u201cAny time Anthony Davis takes the floor, you have a chance to see something special. He continues to get better, and he works extremely hard.\u201d While Davis respects the decision of Lakers starting guard Avery Bradley to skip the NBA\u2019s restart, Davis says he never considered that option with so much to gain from the return. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position to win a championship, but (also), I think we\u2019re stronger together,\u201d Davis said. \u201cEveryone in Orlando, we\u2019re going to obviously be talking about everything that\u2019s going on from a social injustice standpoint. And \u2026 the NBA, I think at that time we\u2019re going to be the only ones on TV. So I think we\u2019re able to have more people in the room from other teams, and receive other ideas and figure out how we can change the world.\u201d The Lakers still don\u2019t know whether Dwight Howard will join them in Orlando, but Vogel believes it\u2019s unlikely Davis will have to play extensively at center even if Howard doesn\u2019t play. That\u2019s undoubtedly good news for Davis, who prefers to play power forward. Davis said he has spent his time off with family. He has been eating well and logging plenty of hours with a controller in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten really great at Call of Duty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten really great at (NBA) 2K.\u201d"},{"id":27232,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-76ers-simmons-recovered-back-injury-restart","date":"2020-07-03","title":"Ben Simmons recovered from back injury for restart","content":" PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Ben Simmons\u2019 back pain threw his postseason status into uncertainty had the NBA season reached its natural conclusion.

I\u2019m feeling great and been rehabbing this whole time, so I\u2019ve been feeling ready and I\u2019m very comfortable.\u201d Simmons, the NBA\u2019s leader in steals, had been quiet except for social media posts since the league shut down March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 23-year-old had missed eighth straight games and was receiving daily treatment for nerve issues in his lower back when the season stopped. Simmons said Thursday it was \u201chard to judge\u201d his readiness for a postseason run in April and beyond. But the extended break gave Simmons \u2014 and banged-up All-Star teammate Joel Embiid \u2014 enough time to rest, rehab and regroup for when the NBA resumes July 30 at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Florida. Simmons\u2019 last game was Feb. 22, when he took such a hard fall in Milwaukee that he was left lying on his back, vomiting from the pain. He is good to go now and can help the Sixers resume their push to win their first NBA title since 1983. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I put on a lot more muscle. I\u2019m ready to go and get rolling.\u201d Simmons averaged 16.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 54 games. Entering a season with NBA championship expectations, the Sixers (39-26) were a disappointing sixth in the Eastern Conference and coach Brett Brown\u2019s job status was a hot topic in Philadelphia. Brown, whose contract runs through 2021-22, may have gained some more time to fix the Sixers because of the shutdown. The Sixers had a roster of mismatched parts, injuries and abysmal road record (10-24) that pushed them toward the brink of being a bust. Philly needed the hiatus as much as any team in the league. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten the best teams in the league,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cWe\u2019re a young, healthy team right now. We\u2019re looking forward to get this opportunity and go all the way.\u201d And if the Sixers win it all, the title will be unlike any other in league history. They\u2019ll spend three months living in a quasi-bubble at the Disney complex after an entire postseason is played without fans, with most if not all of that time away from friends and family. \u201cI trust in the NBA and those older vets like \u2019Bron, like CP3, who are ready to go down there,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThis is our job. I don\u2019t have any problems with people who want to sit out . Everybody\u2019s personal stuff is different. I want to get out there and play.

And the Memphis Grizzlies point guard knows exactly what he wants when he leads his team to Orlando. \u201cGoing out there to win, prove people wrong,\u201d Morant said Thursday in a Zoom video call. Morant, the No. 2 pick overall in the 2019 draft, already has taken advantage of Zion Williamson missing much of the season to make his case as the league\u2019s top rookie. Morant is the Grizzlies\u2019 leading scorer averaging 17.6 points in 59 games played compared to just 19 for Williamson with the Pelicans. With Morant leading the way, the Grizzlies won four of their final six before the NBA stopped play March 12. Memphis goes into Orlando\u2019s seeding games sitting in the eighth spot in the Western Conference with a 3 1\/2-game lead trying to clinch the franchise\u2019s first playoff berth since 2017. Morant, who turns 21 on Aug. 10, didn\u2019t just spend his downtime during the coronavirus shutdown spending time with his family and baby daughter waiting to hear when the NBA would resume play. Nope, Morant said he worked in the weight room and gym adding the 12 pounds of muscle since a loss to Orlando on March 10. That helped fend off worries that the season \u2014 and all the work he had put in \u2014 was over. \u201cI just took it as an opportunity to get even better, even though I didn\u2019t know how it would play out,\u201d Morant said. The extra pounds not only make Morant stronger, but the guard listed at 6-foot-3 and 174 pounds when play stopped expects he will be able to absorb contact better. \u201cAble to use my body more, get through different screens,\u201d Morant said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m just looking to do, go to Orlando to be able to do the things I\u2019ve been doing before but better.\u201d The added muscle is noticeable, at least to his teammates. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said a couple Grizzlies were talking about Morant being bigger Wednesday. \u201cGaining strength has been a priority of his and continues to maintain his supreme athleticism,\u201d Jenkins said. Morant went into his rookie season recovering from arthroscopic surgery to clean up his right knee before the 2019 draft. The time off means he has no pain in his knee, which is easy to see when he\u2019s on the floor. \u201cFeel like I\u2019m actually leaving the floor easier and jumping higher,\u201d Morant said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been taking this time to just focus on my body, make sure everything\u2019s good so when it\u2019s time to go out and play, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d"},{"id":27247,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-ready-nba-season-restart","date":"2020-07-02","title":"Pelicans' Zion Williamson is ready for the NBA's season restart","content":" Josh Hart laments what he figures should\u2019ve been the story of the 2019-20 New Orleans Pelicans. With No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson missing the first 44 games of the season recovering from right knee surgery, the Pelicans limped out the gates to a 6-22 start that included a 13-game losing streak. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what his impact, obviously what his presence does,\u201d Hart told reporters Thursday from the Pelicans\u2019 training facility. \u201cWe started the season, what, 6-22, and now we\u2019re in position to make a push to the playoffs. He\u2019s done an amazing job. So, the addition of him made us more aggressive, more dynamic. I think if we had him at the beginning of the year, the story wouldn\u2019t be a fight for the eighth seed. It would\u2019ve been, we\u2019re the four or five seed in the West, honestly. That\u2019s my opinion. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to have him in the beginning of the year, but he\u2019s helped turn this organization and this season around.\u201d For Williamson\u2019s part, he actually relishes the opportunity to author this strange new chapter for the Pelicans against the backdrop of the country\u2019s battle against COVID-19, its reconciliation with systemic racism and the fight against social injustice. The NBA tips off its restart with New Orleans taking on the Utah Jazz on July 30 at Walt Disney World. With the restart rapidly approaching, the 19-year-old, who turns 20 on Monday, seemed somewhat taken aback. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, man,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually about to go. It\u2019s a lot to process, for sure. But I am excited.\u201d New Orleans sits 3 1\/2 games behind the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies, with eight seeding games in the Orlando bubble to prove its postseason mettle. To prepare for the grind of playing games again after what will be a nearly four-month hiatus, Williamson spent every day during the NBA\u2019s suspension working out with his stepfather, Lee Anderson. Announced as one of the three cover athletes for NBA 2K21 on Wednesday, Williamson declined to divulge specifics about his workouts. But during the Zoom call with reporters on Thursday, Williamson certainly looked to be in solid physical condition, chiseled and toned like the player we saw for just 19 games this season. https:\/\/twitter.com\/PelicansNBA\/status\/1278723691363385345 \u201cI\u2019m preparing myself by bonding with my teammates again, talking to them, saying that we\u2019re gonna get through this, and we\u2019re just gonna battle the mental battle within this,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAs far as me also getting ready for that, it\u2019s just conditioning and honing my skills. At first, it was very tough because you still don\u2019t know what\u2019s fully going on with that situation [regarding COVID-19]. Me and my stepdad just found different ways to stay in condition like on-court, off-court, wherever we could find it. I do feel like I\u2019m in good shape right now. Whenever I was on the court, it was just me and my stepdad. I got to get on the court every day.\u201d Williamson declined to say where he put in the work. \u201cCan\u2019t tell you all my secrets, man,\u201d he joked. \u201cSome things, I\u2019ve got to keep to myself.\u201d Whether it all translates to success in Orlando remains to be seen. New Orleans owns a record of 10-9 with Williamson in the lineup and 18-27 without him in the fold. But in gauging Williamson\u2019s potential impact for the New Orleans\u2019 eight seeding games, look no further than his electrifying regular-season debut in a loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Jan. 22. The rookie scored 17 straight points in the fourth quarter, becoming the only player in history to connect on 4-of-4 from 3-point range in his NBA debut, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Both Williamson and Hart haven\u2019t yet decided exactly what they\u2019ll do in Orlando to advance causes against systemic racism and social injustice. Williamson said he\u2019ll just \u201ccontinue to learn about it and consult with my parents on the best way to use my platform.\u201d Hart plans on taking his name off the back of his jersey, but he remains undecided about what to put in its place. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to keep my name on it. I want to obviously be sensitive about whatever I put on my jersey,\u201d Hart said. \u201cSo that\u2019s going to be a conversation I want to have with some more influential people to see the best use, whatever the best phrase or name or whatever I can put on my jersey. I\u2019m definitely gonna change it. But this time is a sensitive time, so I want to make sure I\u2019m able to put whatever I put on my jersey to help benefit the Black Lives Matter movement and not cause any friction.\u201d When the season was suspended back in March, the Pelicans had won eight of 13 games. David Griffin, the team\u2019s executive vice president of basketball operations, views the NBA\u2019s restart as the ultimate test both mentally and physically. After all, the players will set up for a minimum of five weeks at Disney World, where no visitors will be allowed until completion of the first round of the playoffs. Through the eight seeding games, New Orleans needs to take sole possession of the ninth seed while remaining within four games of No. 8. In order to advance to the postseason for the first time since 2017-18, New Orleans then would need to defeat the eighth seed twice. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that three Pelicans tested positive for coronavirus last week, and currently are in isolation until they receive two negative test results before they can rejoin the squad. \u201cUnfortunately, as a play-in team, we\u2019re sort of disproportionately penalized if we have a COVID case because by the time you get players back, you may already be done, and your competitive advantage may be gone,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing two really important playoffs teams to start. We had an 18-game cushion before [the season was suspended]. We only have eight [now].\u201d That adversity doesn\u2019t put a damper on New Orleans\u2019 prospects for Williamson, who is averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds in 29.7 minutes, while shooting 58.9% from the floor and 46.2% on 3-pointers. \u201cI think this team can be really special when we\u2019re all healthy,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of us coming together, fighting those mental battles, I guess being in the bubble. Just trying to ramp up, that\u2019s the mental battle that I talked about earlier. We\u2019ve got to stick together, keep our emotions high and together, and I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cThe last 12 months have been a different experience, with injury, with all the stuff going on, not playing basketball as much as I\u2019m used to. It\u2019s been a crazy experience. It\u2019s definitely gonna be different [playing without fans in the arena]. I love the fans here in New Orleans. They show so much love. They always come out and support us. So, it is gonna be something different, but that brings me back to what I said on the previous questions: As long as we stick together as a team and give each other energy, I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d * * * Michael C.

The Rockets also defend unlike any other team, especially since they started playing without a center in late January. The Rockets switch screens (and even non-screens) more than any other team, often making their defensive possessions look a lot like their offensive possessions. Some teams are loath to switch screens at all, hoping to avoid mismatches. Some teams will just switch with like-sized guards or wings. Others will switch 1-4, meaning that if there\u2019s a screen not involving the guy that the center is guarding, they\u2019ll switch it. The Rockets don\u2019t have a center, their two starting forwards \u2014 Robert Covington and P.J. Tucker \u2014 are capable of defending guards. Generally, they don\u2019t fear mismatches where their own guards are left defending big men (knowing that post-ups aren\u2019t very efficient). So they\u2019re as liberal as it gets when it comes to switching. And that can make things rather simple for their defenders, limiting confusion on any given possession. The primary goal of switching every screen is keeping the ball in front of the defender. When there\u2019s another defender to meet the ball-handler on the other side of a screen, it\u2019s more difficult for that ball-handler to get into the paint or create an advantage that leaves somebody open. A switch-everything scheme can still be beat over the top. The Rockets are 22-1 when their opponents have shot 32% or worse from 3-point range and with 18-23 when their opponents have shot better than 32%. A switch-everything scheme can also be beat with talent. Good offense beats good defense. But the Rockets have had some success against some of the league\u2019s best offenses. When they\u2019re locked in, they\u2019re switching is sharp, they keep the ball in front of them, and they make you take tough shots. The Rockets will have breakdowns on some switches (see here , here and here ), where two defenders end up guarding the same player, leaving someone open. A switching scheme is also susceptible to screens being slipped, where the screener\u2019s defender is ready to switch, but the other defender doesn\u2019t feel the screen (and the need to switch) \u2026 But generally, the Rockets\u2019 switching is pretty clean. And every game, they\u2019ll have some really impressive switching sequences. Here are a few examples\u2026 Play 1. Danuel House Jr. switches an early Marcus Smart-Jaylen Brown ball screen and then immediately switches a hand-off from Smart to Gordon Hayward. Hayward gets a ball screen from Daniel Theis and P.J. Tucker switches that. House, now guarding a fourth different player in the span of four seconds, is able to recover to Theis as Tucker pressures Hayward, making a pass to Theis more difficult. Hayward eventually backs out into an isolation, Tucker continues with the pressure, and rips the ball out of Hayward\u2019s hands on his drive into the paint. Number to know: The 0.82 points per possession the Rockets have allowed on isolations ranks fourth in the league. Play 2. On a big possession in overtime, the Celtics try twice to catch the Rockets by slipping out of ball screens for Hayward. Eric Gordon doesn\u2019t leave the ball on either one and Robert Covington stays attached to Jayson Tatum on the first slip. Tucker loses contact with Brown on the second, but is able to recover when Brown catches Hayward\u2019s pass at the top of the 3-point arc. Tucker then forces Brown into an awkward pull-up jumper. Number to know: The Rockets rank sixth in clutch defense , having allowed less than a point per possession with the score within five points in the last five minutes. Play 3. The Rockets switch the second of two hand-offs on a weave, and then House switches a weak-side ball-screen for Ja Morant, keeping the ball on the perimeter. After a pair of non-penetrating passes, Morant attacks House off the dribble, drawing help from both Tucker and James Harden. De\u2019Anthony Melton cuts behind Harden, but Russell Westbrook covers for Harden, Covington slides over to Westbrook\u2019s man, and Morant has nowhere to go with the ball, throwing it away. Number to know: Since his arrival, the Rockets have allowed 6.3 fewer points per 100 possessions with Covington on the floor (107.6) than with him on the floor (113.9). Play 4. This is a quick one, where House and Covington both go toward Andrew Wiggins when Damion Lee slips out of a back-screen to the left corner. But Harden sees what\u2019s happening and leaves Marquese Chriss on the block to close out on Lee. House, after realizing the initial mistake, slides over to box out Chriss. Number to know: The Rockets rank 10th in opponent 3-point percentage (34.8%) and 17th in the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from 3-point range (38.4%). Play 5. Back to the Boston game, where the Rockets are up one with less than 20 seconds to go in overtime. Tatum gives up the ball, looking to get it back on a flare off a Theis screen. But Tucker stays attached to Tatum and denies the return pass. Westbrook switches a hand-off from Hayward to Brown and Covington switches a ball screen from Theis, preventing Brown from getting to the basket. Brown misses a step-back jumper and time expires. Number to know: The Rockets have had the league\u2019s best defense (101.4 points allowed per 100 possessions in two games) against the Celtics fifth-ranked offense. Alas, as good as the Rockets can be at switching seamlessly, they still rank 16th defensively , having allowed 109.9 points per 100 possessions. Since going without a center on Jan. 31, they rank 12th defensively (111.0). The Rockets\u2019 issues begin in transition. League-wide effective field goal percentage is highest (60%) in the first six seconds of the shot clock, and no team has allowed their opponents to take a greater percentage of their shots in the first six seconds than the Rockets (17%) \u2026 Play 1. After Harden misses a 3, he gambles in the backcourt, trying to intercept Rudy Gobert\u2019s outlet pass. That doesn\u2019t work, House doesn\u2019t pick anybody up in transition, and Harden is late to arrive as Jordan Clarkson drains a 3-pointer on the other end of the floor. Number to know: According to Synergy play-type tracking, 17.8% of the Rockets\u2019 opponents\u2019 possessions, the league\u2019s second-highest rate , have been in transition. Play 2. After Hayward contests another Harden 3, he leaks out. Harden, however, remains in the backcourt, looking to pick off another outlet pass that never comes. The result is an uncontested layup for Hayward. Number to know: The Rockets are one of two teams \u2014 Atlanta is the other \u2014 who rank in the bottom 10 in opponent second-chance points, opponent fast break points, and opponent points in the paint per 100 possessions. Play 3. After a dead ball, Melton blows by Austin Rivers and finishes over Jeff Green. Number to know: The Rockets have allowed 3.5 more points per 100 possessions with Rivers on the floor (110.3) than they have with him off the floor (106.8). That\u2019s their worst on-off DefRtg differential . Play 4. When Ivica Zubac rebounds a wild save\/shot from House, Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard are standing next to each other on the left wing. Five seconds later, Leonard is scoring on a layup and Westbrook has barely crossed midcourt. Number to know: The Rockets have seen the league\u2019s second biggest increase in pace, from 98.4 possessions per 48 minutes ( 27th ) last season to 103.6 ( fourth ) this season. Play 5. After Eric Gordon misses a 3, the rebound is batted out to Marcus Morris and Gordon actually takes a step backward. Leonard trails the break and drains a 3 before Gordon can get back. Number to know: The Rockets have allowed 148 3-pointers in the first six seconds of the shot clock, tied (with Portland) for most in the league, according to Second Spectrum tracking. When the Rockets switch everything and their opponents can\u2019t gain advantages via screens, the opponents\u2019 possessions often look like those of the Rockets. According to Synergy play-type tracking, 7.9% of their opponent possessions, the league\u2019s highest rate , have been isolations. Consider that stat just counts isolations that end in a shot, drawn foul or turnover from the ball-handler. While defenses can keep the ball in front of them by switching screens, each defender must prevent dribble penetration. The Houston defense can often be broken down in one-on-one situations \u2026 Play 1. The Rockets switch seamlessly (even executing a three-man switch on the left side of the floor) for the first 15 seconds of the shot clock. But on a late-clock isolation, Mike Conley gets by Thabo Sefolosha, draws help from House, and drops the ball off for Tony Bradley. Number to know: The Rockets are one of five teams \u2014 along with the Hornets, Bulls, Cavs and Pistons \u2014 that rank in the bottom 10 in both opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (65.9%, 26th) and the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come in the restricted area (33.7%, 22nd). Play 2. Again, the Rockets seamlessly execute a three-man switch, this time on the ball, with Harden picking up Morant, House sliding down to the rolling Gorgui Dieng, and Tucker switching out to Josh Jackson. Covington then switches a back-screen on Tucker and deflects the ball into the backcourt. But Morant picks it up and gets to the rim, when Harden gets caught reaching. Number to know: The Rockets have been outscored 4.7 points in the paint per game. That\u2019s the the league\u2019s third-worst discrepancy, better than only those of the Wizards (-5.6) and Warriors (-5.0). Play 3. The Rockets successfully switch a \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cstack\u201d pick-and-roll, with Covington switching onto Zubac after a back-screen from Paul George. George then beats Tucker off the dribble, drawing help from Covington and gets Zubac a dunk. Number to know: Tucker has defended 105 isolation possessions, second most in the league . The 0.87 points per possession he\u2019s allowed on isolations ranks 12th among 20 players who have defended at least 75. Play 4. Two switches put Harden on Marcus Smart, who breaks down the league\u2019s leading scorer with a hesitation move, collapses the defense, and kicks the ball out for a Hayward corner 3-pointer. Number to know: Twenty-seven percent of the Rockets\u2019 opponents\u2019 3-point attempts have come from the corners. That\u2019s the second-highest opponent rate, lower than only that of the Raptors (33%). Play 5. Green is there in the paint when Jarrett Culver drives by Ben McLemore\u2019s close-out. But Culver gets by Green with a spin move. Number to know: Since they went to full-time small-ball (Jan. 31), the Rockets rank 22nd in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (66.7%) and 25th in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come in the restricted area (34.9%). When the opponent is playing one-on-one, the defender on the ball isn\u2019t the only one that has a job to do. If one of his teammates isn\u2019t aware of both his man and the ball, things can break down \u2026 Play 1. The Rockets stifle a Joe Ingles drive, but Westbrook is a hair late in reacting to Clarkson\u2019s dive to the rim. Number to know: The Rockets are 23-2 when they\u2019ve scored more than 115 points per 100 possessions , with this Feb. 9 game to the Jazz (decided by a ridiculous shot at the buzzer ) being one of the two losses. Play 2. The Rockets successfully switch a few screens, but another weak-side dive (from Culver) catches Rivers off guard, and Westbrook can\u2019t keep the rookie from finishing. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum, 15.6% of the Rockets\u2019 opponents\u2019 shots have come in the last six seconds of the shot clock. That\u2019s the seventh-highest opponent rate. Play 3. When Julius Randle cuts behind a ball-watching Gordon, Tucker is there to pick him up. But then Maurice Harkless cuts behind Harden, who was digging toward Randle in the post. Number to know: The Rockets have been the league\u2019s slowest-moving team , averaging just 3.99 miles per hour. The biggest issue with playing small is being small \u2026 an issue can be exacerbated by the Rockets\u2019 switching. It\u2019s enough of a challenge for the 6-foot-5 Tucker to keep opposing seven-footers off the glass . When the Rockets\u2019 not-so-beefy players switch onto opposing bigs, rebounding becomes even more difficult. After they went to full-time small-ball, the Rockets ranked dead last in defensive rebounding percentage , grabbing just 68.3% of available defensive boards\u2026 Play 1. Willy Hernangomez is initially being guarded by Tucker, but after a pair of switches, McLemore is tasked with handling Hernangomez under the basket as House forces a tough step-back from Miles Bridges at the end of the shot clock. Harden slides over to box out, but Hernangomez reaches over Harden and taps the ball out. He then sets a screen for Terry Rozier, who beats Harden off the dribble. Number to know: The Rockets have been outrebounded in 16 of the 17 games they\u2019ve played since they went to full-time small-ball. This loss in Charlotte was the one exception. Play 2. After two switches, Westbrook is guarding Rudy Gobert in the paint. Covington bails him out, but Gobert still has the reach advantage on the rebound. The ball ends up in the hands of Donovan Mitchell, who drains a 3-pointer. Number to know: This will be the fourth time in the last five seasons that the Rockets rank in the bottom 10 in defensive rebounding percentage , though they ranked fourth two seasons ago. Play 3. A three-way switch leaves House trying to box out Zubac. He\u2019s unsuccessful and Westbrook fouls Zubac on the rebound. Number to know: The Rockets\u2019 starting lineup \u2014 Harden, Westbrook, House, Covington and Tucker \u2014 has grabbed just 46.6% of available rebounds, the fourth-lowest rate among 50 lineups that have played at least 150 minutes together. Play 4. The Rockets force a James Ennis pull-up 2 late in the clock, but switches have Rivers trying to keep Mo Bamba off the glass. He doesn\u2019t do so well. Number to know: Weirdly, the Rockets are one of six teams who have not allowed at least 25 second chance points in a game this season. Their opponent high is 24 (Lakers on Jan. 18). Play 5. When Mitchell Robinson sets a ball screen for Kevin Knox, Green switches onto the ball and Gordon slides down to pick up the roll man, preventing a lob and seemingly rescuing McLemore from having to handle the seven-footer. Gordon isn\u2019t big enough either and gets dunked on for his effort. Number to know: In this March 2 game, the Knicks outrebounded the Rockets, 65-34. That\u2019s tied for the biggest rebound differential in the league this season. The Rockets aren\u2019t going to be taller when the season resumes. In fact, they\u2019ll be shorter, having waived Isaiah Hartenstein, one of the two seven footers they had on the roster. Rebounding will continue to be an issue. Many of their defensive breakdowns are fixable. Houston has shown that, when it is locked in, it can be pretty good on defense. While the Rockets rank 16th defensively overall, they have the eighth-best defense (110.0 points allowed per 100 possessions in 23 games) against the league\u2019s top-10 offenses . They have the second-smallest difference between their winning percentage vs. the 17 teams under .500 (25-13, .658) and their winning percentage vs. the 13 teams with winning records (15-11, .577). When the Warriors won their second straight championship with Kevin Durant two seasons ago, the Rockets took them to seven games in the conference finals \u2026 with defense. Those three Houston wins were three of Golden State\u2019s six worst offensive games of that postseason, with Games 4 and 5 being the two worst. With how well and often they switched screens, the Rockets stifled the Warriors\u2019 ball movement and forced tough shots. Maybe there\u2019s more of that kind of defense coming from the Rockets. Swapping Clint Capela for Covington not only gave them an extra shooter on offense, it gave them one of the most versatile defenders in the league, an ideal fit in their switch-everything scheme. Despite the rebounding issues, the Rockets\u2019 have allowed just 101.8 points per 100 possessions in 238 total minutes with Harden, Westbrook, Covington and Tucker on the floor together. At the same time, they\u2019ve scored much more efficiently in those minutes (111.1 per 100) than they did in 652 total minutes with the other three and Capela instead of Covington (104.1). The Rockets\u2019 defense isn\u2019t going to be as good as their offense, which is now in its fourth straight season of ranking first or second in efficiency . But the defense just needs to be good enough for the Rockets to be a dangerous team in the Western Conference playoffs. If the switching is sharp and their other issues can be minimized, the defense is capable of giving the Rockets a chance. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

As he and the Kings gear up for the restart of the 2019-20 NBA season , Fox on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to staying with Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same,\u201d Fox said in a Zoom call with reporters at Golden 1 Center. \u201c\u2026 I see myself being here. I want to be here. \u201cObviously, you know, we want to win. Right now, I think, last year we put ourselves in a pretty good position. This year, we\u2019re sort of in the same position to make the playoffs. That\u2019s what we all want and continue to take the next step forward.\u201d The Kings have not made the playoffs since 2006, but are among the 22 teams invited to the restart in Orlando later this month. As such, they\u2019ll have a chance at ending that drought if they can find a way to leapfrog the three teams ahead of them in the Western Conference (Sacramento trails the current No. 8 seed, the Memphis Grizzlies, by 3 1\/2 games). Fox, who cut off his stylish spikes and curls during the coronavirus pandemic and now sports a closer-cropped hair style, has one year remaining on the four-year, $24.5 million contract he signed as a rookie. He would be eligible for a five-year extension worth up to 25% of the salary cap for the 2021-22 season. Per The Sacramento Bee , Fox would have to sign his extension during the abbreviated offseason between the end of the 2019-20 season and the start of the 2020-21 season, which is tentatively scheduled to begin on Dec. 1. If that deal does not take place, Fox would be a restricted free agent in the summer of 2021. In past conversations with The Sacramento Bee \u2018s Jason Anderson, Fox had expressed his desire to stay with the team even in the midst of some tumultuous times in the 2019-20 season. Fox missed nearly six weeks with an ankle injury he suffered in mid-November, but returned to the lineup on Dec. 17 . After a slow start to the season stats-wise for Fox, the third-year guard found his stride and was averaging 21 points, 4 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game before the season hiatus began on March 11. A Jan. 24 loss to the Chicago Bulls was a bit of a watershed moment in Fox\u2019s season. On that day, the following transpired in the Kings\u2019 world: former lottery pick Marvin Bagley III showed up to shootaround in a walking boot, star guard Buddy Hield was moved into a reserve role vs. Chicago and the Kings lost the game, dropping them to 13 games under .500. In the lead-up to that game, Fox talked with The Sacramento Bee and had the following to say about his future with the Kings: As a rookie, Fox averaged 11.6 ppg and 4.4 apg but was left off both of the All-Rookie teams. In 2018-19, he took flight and averaged 17.3 ppg and 7.3 apg to finish third in the Kia Most Improved Player voting. This season, he\u2019s averaging 20.4 ppg and 6.8 apg while ranking among this season\u2019s leaders in total drives . The Kings face some roster decisions this summer with not only Fox but also young forward Bogdan Bogdanovic, who could be an unrestricted free agent this summer. Bogdanovic said in mid-October that he enjoys playing for Sacramento, but that he doesn\u2019t want to \u201crush anything\u201d in terms of a future decision. Overall, Fox wants to stay put with the Kings and further explained his reasoning to The Sacramento Bee as follows: \u201cMy first year, we won 27 games, but every game we played at home was a packed house. There are times we\u2019ve played in Detroit or Atlanta or somewhere and half the arena is empty, so you see the love Sacramento has for the team. \u201cI know the fans are frustrated. They want to win. We want to win, too, and if you\u2019re able to win in this city, it\u2019s going to feel a lot better than winning somewhere else.\u201d"},{"id":27228,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wnba-maya-moore-helps-free-missouri-man-prison","date":"2020-07-02","title":"Inmate backed by WNBA's Maya Moore released from prison","content":" JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A Missouri man was freed from prison Wednesday after a county prosecutor declined to retry his case, punctuating years of work by WNBA star Maya Moore and other supporters who argued he was falsely convicted of burglary and assault charges. Moore was on hand when Jonathan Irons, 40, walked out of the Jefferson City Correctional Center. She clapped as Irons approached a group of people waiting for his release. She then dropped to her knees at one point before joining a group hug around Irons. He had been serving a 50-year prison sentence stemming from the non-fatal shooting of a homeowner in the St. Louis area when Irons was 16. But a judge threw out his convictions in March, citing a series of problems with the case, including a fingerprint report that had not been turned over to Irons\u2019 defense team, according to The New York Times . The Missouri attorney general\u2019s office unsuccessfully appealed the judge\u2019s decision, and the lead prosecutor in St. Charles County decided against a retrial. Moore and Irons became friends after meeting through prison ministry, according to the Times. The 31-year-old Moore, a Jefferson City, Missouri, native who starred at UConn before helping lead Minnesota to four WNBA titles, put her career on hold last season to help Irons. Moore said in January she planned to sit out a second season and miss the Tokyo Olympics. After Irons\u2019 convictions were thrown out in March, she told The Associated Press her plans hadn\u2019t changed. \u201c\u2019My decision to take another year was bigger than this case,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBut obviously this case was in the forefront of my mind.

In fact, whichever team snags the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy by early-to-mid October \u2014 whether that\u2019s Antetokounmpo\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks or someone else \u2014 will have survived and accomplished more than possibly any of the 73 champions who came before them. \u201cI feel like this is going to be the toughest championship you could ever win,\u201d Antetokounmpo told reporters on a Wednesday conference video call after participating in the Bucks\u2019 first day of individual workouts at their training facility in Milwaukee. \u201cBecause circumstances are really tough right now. Whoever wants it more is going to be able to go out there and take it.\u201d There has been a notion advanced by some \u2014 including Hall of Fame center Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2014 that the unprecedented, stop-and-start, pass-spring-and-go-directly-to-summer restart of the 2019-20 season (pushing The Finals into autumn), will produce a bogus, flukey, one-off winner. In May, the legendary big man turned commentator on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside The NBA\u201d show wondered if this year\u2019s unique set of circumstances might produce an undeserving champion. \u201cMost of the time you could predict who is going to win a championship,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cNow what if we come back and a team that wasn\u2019t supposed to win wins. There\u2019s going to be an asterisk behind that championship.\u201d That\u2019s one way to look at it. Others could argue that surviving the on- and off-court challenges posed by the coronavirus shutdown and the \u201cbubble\u201d return in Orlando, on top of four best-of-seven playoff series, could result in the most rigorous, remarkable title run yet. Antetokounmpo, whose Milwaukee team again posted the best regular-season record (53-12) prior to the March 11 hiatus, holds that view as he and the Bucks revive their title hopes. \u201cLike I said before, this is the toughest title,\u201d said the 2019 Kia MVP and favorite to repeat this year. \u201cYou go somewhere without your family for three months and you haven\u2019t played basketball for three-and-a-half, four months. Whatever team wants it more has got to be mentally prepared for this situation. And has to go out there and execute. \u201cTeams got to be in shape. So whoever took care of themselves for these four months we weren\u2019t able to play, [they are] gonna be in a better position. \u2026 Whoever wants it more, whoever is mentally prepared for all this, that team is going to come out on top.\u201d The asterisk talk in NBA circles goes back at least to 1999 , when the San Antonio Spurs beat the New York Knicks in The Finals at the end of a lockout-shortened season. That truncated schedule allowed for just 50 games before the playoffs, and San Antonio played a mere 67 games in winning the franchise\u2019s first championship. The following spring, in a bit of snide gamesmanship, Lakers coach Phil Jackson wondered if the Spurs\u2019 feat needed some sort of qualifier or disclaimer. Hence, the asterisk. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer was an assistant coach on that San Antonio staff. He believes now what he believed then about trying to assess the worthiness of a championship. Please, stop. \u201cI feel like the champion from this experience, from this season, is going to be more worthy and more special than any champion,\u201d Budenholzer said . Every year is different, he said. Every year seems to favor one team or the other as the playoffs approach, though reality rarely plays out as expected. This herky-jerky and all too vulnerable restart is unlike anything that has preceded it. One positive test can sideline your star player or group of players \u2013 or the other team\u2019s star or group \u2013 for a week in the midst of a series. And that\u2019s just for starters. Antetokounmpo talked about a variety of factors over which he and other NBA players will have little or no control. Any one of which \u2014 isolation in the \u201cbubble,\u201d separation from family and friends, pushing yourself too hard, too soon \u2014 could derail a player, his team or the entire endeavor. Just shooting and lifting weights Wednesday in the \u201cnew normal\u201d of physical distancing, masks and limited coach-and-teammate contact gave the Bucks a taste of precautions and changes to come. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird, I\u2019m not gonna lie to you,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cTraining tables are like six feet apart from one another. Coaches are wearing masks. We\u2019ve got to be really careful after we shoot, we\u2019ve got to leave the court and allow the next person to come in and shoot. \u201cYou\u2019re not as close to your teammate as you want to be.\u201d From all that physical and emotional space since early March, Milwaukee and the other 21 teams that descend on the Walt Disney complex outside Orlando will be sequestered until they are eliminated or a champion is crowned. Distanced from the social issues that animated so many NBA players in June. No fans in the arena, no home or road court experience. \u201cNow that we don\u2019t have the [home court] advantage anymore, it sucks a little bit,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe worked all year to play at home, play with our fans. We tried hard to be at home. \u2026 Not being able to have them out there, I think it\u2019s going to be hard to live with. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we won\u2019t have fans, other teams won\u2019t have fans.\u201d Antetokounmpo became a father in February when his girlfriend Mariah Riddlesprigger gave birth to their son , Liam Charles. Per the bubble regulations, players\u2019 family and friends will not be permitted to join them until after the playoffs\u2019 first round. That might take until late August, which is worse than any extended rodeo or circus road trip in the regular season. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled though China, traveled through France and stayed for two or three weeks. In the hotel, just playing basketball,\u201d said Antetokounmpo, mentioning youth FIBA tournaments that kept him away from home for long stretches. \u201cObviously it\u2019s tough. I can\u2019t imagine going there for three months.\u201d Now add this wrinkle: Seeing your arch nemeses, the guys vying for the same trophy and legacy-enhancer, day after day after day. All these competitive rivals will be holed up in the same place. Antetokounmpo thinks the early hiccups of performance TV viewers see early, mistakes of timing or rust, will improve rapidly. But seeing James Harden, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam off the clock, hanging out, may take some getting used to. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go against somebody, you don\u2019t live with them. You don\u2019t want to see them every day. You don\u2019t want to go down and grab lunch or dinner and see them right there in front of you. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to stay locked in. Mind my business, not say much. Obviously I\u2019m going to see them, but they\u2019re going to see me too. It goes both ways.\u201d Now mix in all the unforeseen twists and hurdles of the \u201cbubble\u201d project, including random events the league \u2014 however crafty \u2014 won\u2019t have anticipated, and it\u2019s clear why Antetokounmpo and others contend whoever wins in 2020 will be enlarged, not diminished. Said Budenholzer: \u201cThe challenges of this season, y\u2019know, this pandemic, everything that\u2019s happening in our country, the ability for a team to go back and compete and play against the other [21] teams and come out as a champion, in my mind it will be more special and more meaningful. \u201cThey\u2019re all special, they\u2019re all incredible. If you won one, you can say whatever you want about it. That team is happy.\u201d If anyone wins one this year, the whole league should be happy. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

James and his voting rights group , formed this spring with other black athletes and entertainers, are joining with other professional basketball leaders and Michigan\u2019s top elections official to push for mega voting sites to accommodate in-person balloting amid the COVID-19 pandemic. More Than A Vote, the James organization dedicated to maximizing Black turnout in November, shared its plans with The Associated Press on Wednesday after the Detroit Pistons became the second NBA franchise to announce plans to use its arena for voting later this year. In Georgia, Fulton County elections officials this week approved the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 proposal to use State Farm Arena as a polling site. Plans call for the arena to serve any Fulton County voters during early voting and on Election Day, Nov. 3. The idea, which comes after Kentucky used large facilities in its June 23 primary, is to use large spaces that allow for in-person voting while still enforcing social distancing guidelines. It also underscores the attention on the mechanics of voting amid the pandemic, with the intensity already reflected in both President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden warning that state and local officials have the power to \u201ccorrupt\u201d the election. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson called her \u201cpartnership\u201d with the Pistons a \u201cblueprint for other teams and leagues seeking to advance our common goal of protecting access to the vote for all.\u201d Lloyd Pierce, head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, said the arrangement in his city ensures \u201chigh turnout\u201d in a safe environment. Benson, Pierce and David Fizdale, former New York Knicks head coach, will advise NBA franchises and arena management entities around the country on how to replicate the existing deals. The Milwaukee Bucks also confirmed they are willing to use their home arena as a voting site in the most populous city in the key battleground of Wisconsin. The coordinated push is a turnabout, of sorts, in the often-partisan jousting over voting procedures. Some Democrats panned Kentucky elections officials for limiting in-person June primary voting in the state\u2019s two most populous counties to Louisville\u2019s Exposition Center and the University of Kentucky football stadium in Lexington. Voting rights advocates argued in federal court that the plan, part of culling voting sites statewide amid coronavirus concerns, would harm minority voters. A federal judge rejected their claims, and voting proceeded without the melee that some advocates had forecast. Now, Benson, a Democrat, is pushing the arena model not as an example of potential voter suppression, but a way to fight it. \u201cOne of our greatest challenges in protecting voters\u2019 access to democracy this November is identifying accessible locations where citizens can safely vote in person,\u201d she said. Amid COVID, that could outweigh potential logistical difficulties of large sites. Lines for such venues can still be long \u2014 just as with normal polling locations \u2014 as was seen in Lexington at some points on primary day. Voters also could face traffic jams or public transit hiccups given the number of people involved. General elections also have considerably larger turnout than primaries. Nonetheless, there\u2019s a growing bipartisan push for large-venue voting. NFL executive Scott Pioli last week presented the National Association of Secretaries of State a plan for widespread use of professional and college sports facilities. James\u2019 group is officially nonpartisan. But the NBA star has been open about its emphasis on the Black community, where Trump faces intense opposition for his white identity politics. James has not endorsed Biden, but he endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. In Milwaukee, meanwhile, the Bucks owners, the Lasry family, are major Democratic Party donors. Bucks executive Alex Lasry helped lead the effort that landed the Democratic National Convention in the city."},{"id":27241,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-jr-smith-orlando-restart","date":"2020-07-01","title":"JR Smith signs deal with Lakers for season restart","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 J.R. Smith has joined LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers for their championship push. The Lakers announced their long-anticipated signing of Smith as a substitute player Wednesday, the first day allowed under the rules of the NBA\u2019s summer restart. Smith is the Lakers\u2019 replacement for Avery Bradley , who cited family reasons last week for his decision not to finish the season with his team in Orlando. The 34-year-old Smith hasn\u2019t played in the NBA since November 2018, but the 2013 Sixth Man of the Year is a longtime trusted teammate of James. During their four years together with the Cleveland Cavaliers, they won a title in 2016 and reached four consecutive NBA Finals. Bradley was a starter and a key role player in his first season with the Lakers, averaging 8.6 points per game and playing solid wing defense. But the Western Conference-leading Lakers also excelled while Bradley missed 13 games due to injury, with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope capably filling the role. Smith is a 15-year NBA veteran but he has been out of the league since the Cavaliers dropped him early in their first season after James\u2019 move to Los Angeles. Smith worked out for the Lakers in February before the club signed Dion Waiters , who didn\u2019t get to suit up for the Lakers before the coronavirus pandemic suspended the season. Smith\u2019s perimeter defense and 3-point shooting fit well into the Lakers\u2019 plans, even if he is likely to play only a supporting role in Orlando. Bradley\u2019s minutes are expected to be mostly taken up by Caldwell-Pope and Alex Caruso, with Waiters and Smith providing depth while the Lakers pursue their franchise\u2019s 17th championship. Smith is ninth in NBA history with 288 career playoff 3-pointers made while hitting 37% of his 3-point shots. He is fourth in league history in NBA Finals 3-pointers made."},{"id":27231,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-not-skipping-season-restart","date":"2020-07-01","title":"Despite virus cases, Nets say no thought to skipping season restart","content":" NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving aren\u2019t coming back. DeAndre Jordan and Wilson Chandler aren\u2019t going, either. Spencer Dinwiddie is a maybe, with his status unclear after both he and Jordan tested positive for the coronavirus. The Brooklyn Nets don\u2019t look ready for a restart, but general manager Sean Marks said Wednesday there was no discussion of the team not traveling to Florida for the resumption of the NBA season. \u201cLook, we have a job to do,\u201d Marks said. \u201cAgain, we have to bring a team to Orlando. We will bring a team to Orlando. We will go down there and we will compete. That\u2019s our jobs here.\u201d It\u2019s not an easy one for interim coach Jacque Vaughn, who took over when the Nets surprisingly parted ways with Kenny Atkinson on March 7. He won his first two games, capped by an impressive victory over the West-leading Lakers in Los Angeles. Then the season stopped and his challenges really began. Vaughn had moved Jordan into the starting lineup, but now the job apparently goes back to Jarrett Allen. If Dinwiddie can\u2019t play \u2014 he is currently on the travel list but is experiencing symptoms \u2014 Vaughn might need a new point guard, too. And NBA rules haven\u2019t been allowing teams to practice together, so it may take almost until the July 31 resumption before Vaughn knows who he\u2019s sending out on the court for the (re)opening tip. \u201cJust like we drew it up,\u201d Vaughn joked. The Nets had higher hopes when the season was suspended. Not only were they playing well, but a long break presented the possibility that both Durant and Irving might be recovered from surgeries, turning Brooklyn into much more than the average No. 7 seed. But neither player plans to join the Nets at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex. Marks thought it best for rehabbing players to remain where they were, particularly after Durant\u2019s recovery was affected when he was among four Nets to test positive for the virus in March. Some Nets players left New York then and the team had discussions with the league about whether it should go directly to Florida when it was time to return. They eventually decided it was best to first come back to Brooklyn, and both Dinwiddie and Jordan tested positive after returning. \u201cHindsight, we can all say things would have went differently had we gone down to Orlando early or gone somewhere else, but at the end of the day this is a pandemic that I don\u2019t think anyone could quite put their fingers on with how it\u2019s being spread and so forth,\u201d Marks said. \u201cWe have a lot of questions.\u201d It\u2019s not as if the team hasn\u2019t been careful: Vaughn was wearing gloves while conducting a Zoom interview Tuesday. He sent his family to Phoenix when the virus struck New York, only to find that Arizona\u2019s cases are now rising. Marks said he will support any player who chooses not to play, which Chandler did for family reasons. The Nets have been adjusting their roster, signing Tyler Johnson and waiving Theo Pinson among their changes. The Nets have a half-game lead over Orlando for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference and are set to face the Magic on July 31 in their first game back. Holding onto a playoff spot might help Vaughn keep the coaching job next season. But like everything else about this season, nothing can be certain. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook, no handbook for this scenario,\u201d Vaughn said."},{"id":27224,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mavericks-sign-trey-burke-substitute-player","date":"2020-07-01","title":"Mavericks sign Trey Burke as substitute player","content":" DALLAS \u2014 The Dallas Mavericks announced today that they have signed guard Trey Burke as a substitute player for the remainder of the 2019-20 season. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. Burke (6-0, 185) returns for his second stint with Dallas after appearing in for 25 games (one start) for the club last season. After being acquired by the franchise in the seven-player trade that brought Kristaps Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee to Dallas on Jan. 31, 2019, Burke averaged 9.7 points and 2.6 assists in 17.4 minutes for the Mavericks over the second half of the 2018-19 campaign. The seven-year veteran holds career averages of 10.5 points, 2.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 22.9 minutes in 386 games (128 starts) with Utah, Washington, New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. After signing with the 76ers last summer, Burke appeared in 25 games for Philadelphia this season and averaged 5.9 points, 2.1 assists and 13.2 minutes before being waived on Feb. 6. Burke was an early entry candidate for the 2013 NBA Draft after his sophomore season at Michigan.

The Columbus, Ohio, native, was named the National College Player of the Year, a Consensus First Team All-American and the Bob Cousy Award winner as a sophomore while helping the Wolverines reach the national championship game in 2013. Burke played both of his collegiate seasons alongside Hardaway Jr. at Michigan. Hardaway Jr. (24th overall pick) and Burke went on to become the first pair of Wolverines taken in the first round of a draft since Juwan Howard (fifth) and Jalen Rose (13th) in 1994.

Brown, whose contract runs through 2021-22, also expected fellow All-Star Joel Embiid to start the season in the best shape of his professional career. The Sixers need their franchise stars at full strength if one of the early favorites to win the East Conference can shake off both an ordinary regular season (39-26; 6th in the East) and a nearly five-month layoff to return contenders for their first NBA championship since 1983. The 23-year-old Simmons had missed his eighth straight game and was receiving daily treatment for his nerve issues in his lower back when the season stopped. Embiid was recovering from surgery on his left hand and had just returned after missing five games with a sprained left shoulder at the time of the shutdown. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Joel to come in as good a shape as he has been in since I have coached him,\u201d Brown said Wednesday. Simmons, who averaged 16.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 54 games, was hurt in a Feb. 22 game at Milwaukee. He vomited because of the pain and there was no guarantee he would have been ready for the playoffs had the season not been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. Simmons, the league leader in steals, worked out and played pickup games with LeBron James \u2014 and videos of the two showed both stars playing without mask. Simmons\u2019 trainer, Chris Johnson, posted video two weeks ago of a shirtless Simmons shooting and dunking. \u201cHe\u2019s good to go. He\u2019s put in a tremendous amount of work for me to be able to confidently say that,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think when you search for silver linings with this pandemic and the way things have shaped up, it would be hard-pressed for me to find something more obvious than this. It\u2019s enabled Ben to reclaim his health. But I think \u2018inching along\u2019 from maybe a month ago, that is not true.\u201d Embiid has been riddled with injuries since he was drafted with the No. 3 pick of the 2014 draft. Embiid, averaging 23.4 points and 12.3 rebounds, has never played more than 64 games in a season. He was hindered by illness and knee injuries during last season\u2019s playoff run, and the Sixers worked this season to balance his minutes with the proper amount of rest. The Sixers signed the 25-year-old Embiid, a native of Cameroon, to a $148 million, five-year extension that kicked in at the start of the 2018-19 season. It\u2019s about time for the big man to deliver when the NBA resumes July 30 at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Florida. \u201cThere is nobody on our team that has put in more time than Joel Embiid,\u201d Brown said. \u201cForget what he has actually done in the gym for a minute, just go to the man hours and consecutive days and the amount of days that he has put in over the past few months. I\u2019m proud of him, I respect him. He needed to do it.

Additionally, former lottery pick Trey Burke said on July 1 that he has signed a deal with the Mavs for the rest of the 2019-20 season. Cauley-Stein is in his first season with the Mavericks and is averaging 5.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game while shooting 68.9% overall in 13 games. He spent the first 41 games of the season with the Golden State, averaging 7.9 ppg, 6.2 rpg and 1.2 blocks per game in 37 starts for the Warriors. Dallas acquired him via a trade on Jan. 25. Since coming over to the Mavericks, Cauley-Stein\u2019s role has been that of a backup big man and he had yet to play more than 25 minutes in a game with Dallas. The Mavs have been thin on the front line since losing big man Dwight Powell to a ruptured right Achilles tendon in January.

Citing HIPAA privacy rules, Griffin declined to identify which players tested positive, saying that each of those individuals are currently in \u201cself-isolation\u201d and being tested daily for the virus. Griffin explained the team received the positive test results last week when the players returned to New Orleans\u2019 training facilities. \u201cTo this point, we have had positive tests,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cFrom a HIPAA standpoint, I\u2019m not going to talk about any of those individuals. We\u2019ve had multiple players test positive. The league has a system in place that was designed to catch these cases. That system worked, and we\u2019re just going to deal with it the best we can moving forward. From a basketball standpoint, I think you\u2019re going to see COVID have an enormous impact on teams, and even some of the teams that went into the bubble as a playoff seed. You\u2019ve seen that Brooklyn has been really damaged by the COVID situation. So again, this is something where we\u2019re all at the mercy of the same enemy.\u201d In New Orleans\u2019 case, the Pelicans remain 3.5 games behind the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies with its season set to resume July 30 against the Utah Jazz, followed by an Aug. 1 outing against the L.A. Clippers, before an Aug. 3 tip against Memphis. As one of the play-in teams that needs to fare well in its eight seeding games to advance to the playoffs, Griffin thinks New Orleans could be at a slight disadvantage after three of its players have tested positive for COVID-19. Griffin complimented the league for understanding that teams would inevitably receive positive tests for COVID-19, which is \u201cwhy the league put in as much time as they did between report date and mandatory workouts\u201d to level the playing field. \u201cUnfortunately, as a play-in team, we\u2019re sort of disproportionately penalized if we have a COVID case because by the time you get players back, you may already be done, and your competitive advantage may be gone,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSo, in our situation, COVID is going to play a much bigger role than it will for an established playoff team. We\u2019re playing two really important playoffs teams to start. We had an 18-game cushion before [the season was suspended]. We only have eight [now].\u201d The NBA announced last week that 16 players tested positive for COVID-19 among the 22 teams selected to play at Walt Disney World. Per the league\u2019s protocol, the Pelicans are testing players every other day. The players that tested positive test daily, Griffin said. \u201cWhen they can have two negative tests, they can return to activities with the team.\u201d Having survived three bouts with cancer, Griffin said he still plans to travel with the team to Orlando for resumption of the season. \u201cI\u2019m not at all in the high-risk area,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask my players to do anything I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d That goes for coaches, too. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry is 65, which is considered a high-risk age for COVID-19. When asked whether Gentry would join the team in Orlando, Griffin said that \u201cis to be determined.\u201d Gentry, meanwhile, expressed a desire to be there for a team that stuck by him through tough times. From Nov. 23 to Dec. 17, the Pelicans dropped 13-straight games, including a pair of overtime losses to the Phoenix Suns and Brooklyn Nets. \u201cUsually when that happens in this league or really any other league, there\u2019s a good chance that the players just kind of quit on you,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cThat never happened here. They were in the foxhole and stood by me. I want to do the same thing for them. I want to be there for them. I want to be in Orlando, and I want to give us an opportunity to try to do well in this situation.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Its continued evolution in improving our game is an example of the dedication the NBA\u2019s Referee Operations department has to excellence and innovation.\u201d Borgia was instrumental in the design and development of the NBA Replay Center, which opened with the 2014-15 season. The state-of-the-art facility, based in Secaucus, N.J., has been a groundbreaking tool to enhance the performance of NBA referees and to accelerate the replay review process. For five seasons from 2014-19, Borgia was the main point of contact for the NBA Replay Center. This season, he refocused his efforts on the newly created Coach\u2019s Challenge. As he did with the Replay Center, Borgia developed the rules and handled the execution for the Coach\u2019s Challenge, which was approved by the NBA Board of Governors for use during the 2019-20 season. \u201cJoe\u2019s imprint on the NBA and contributions to a multitude of officiating platforms will be lasting,\u201d said Byron Spruell, President, League Operations. \u201cWe thank him for his leadership, passion and committed service to the game, and wish him the best in his retirement.\u201d Borgia was hired to the NBA referee staff in 1988. He officiated 10 seasons before an injury forced him to retire in 1998. He joined the basketball and referee operations department in 1999. He served as the NBA\u2019s rules interpreter for more than 15 years, creating training videos and interpreting the rules of the game for officials, teams, broadcasters and media. Borgia made many in-game and postgame appearances on network television to give broadcasters and viewers clarity on rules interpretation and officiating calls. He was also instrumental in converting the NBA\u2019s recruitment and development of officials from the Continental Basketball Association to the NBA\u2019s D-League (currently the G League). On the court, Borgia worked two of the most famous games in NBA history: the highest-scoring game (Detroit Pistons at Denver Nuggets, 186-184 on Dec. 13, 1983) and the longest modern-day game (Seattle SuperSonics at Milwaukee Bucks, which lasted five overtimes, on Nov. 9, 1989). Borgia is the son of the late Sid Borgia, a legendary referee who officiated in the NBA for 20 years beginning in 1946.

General manager Tommy Sheppard effectively ruled out Wall returning this season when he said Monday the 29-year-old wouldn\u2019t be part of the Wizards\u2019 traveling party to Central Florida. Among the factors in the decision was a cap of 35 people per team in the quarantined bubble at Walt Disney World. The COVID-19 pandemic also hindered Wall\u2019s progress in his rehab from multiple surgeries. \u201cHe definitely lost all the basketball gains that he had made,\u201d Sheppard said on a video call with reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got to focus on what he\u2019s got to do, but having somebody go into that bubble that\u2019s not going to play, that\u2019s just more people going into the bubble.\u201d Wall hasn\u2019t played an NBA game since December 2018. Surgery for bone spurs in his left heel ended that season; while he was working his way back from that, he tore his left Achilles tendon and needed another operation in 2019. He declared himself \u201c110 percent\u201d healthy in late May , saying, \u201cI\u2019m itching to get back out there.\u201d The Wizards put the brakes on that, meaning Wall will try to return for the 2020-21 season as originally planned. \u201cHe\u2019s been fantastic in keeping his weight and being active during all this period, and this will be a continuation of the work and the plan that we\u2019ve done for him,\u201d Wizards chief of athletic care and performance Daniel Medina said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that his body and his mind are at the highest level for a safe and successful return when he comes back.\u201d Sheppard said Wall will continue to work out under team supervision in Washington and Miami. Coaches who are not part of the group of 35 quarantining at Disney World will be available to oversee his progress. \u201cThe last thing I ever have to worry about is John Wall\u2019s work ethic,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get after this.

The Hawks certainly expect so after offering to transform State Farm Arena into a voting precinct for the fall elections to make a smooth experience for registered Fulton County residents and the city. Suddenly, a spacious basketball arena that was supposed to be dark in fall \u2014 the revamped 2020-21 NBA season tentatively isn\u2019t scheduled to begin until late November \u2014 will be transformed into an election epicenter that city and county officials say is sorely needed. The 700,000 square-foot arena will resolve a variety of issues mostly caused by COVID-19 and the need for safety and distancing measures, starting with early voting on July 20 for the runoff election on August 11. Fulton County Registration and Elections will also make the arena its central operations site for absentee ballot processing and vote tabulations. In this partnership, the Hawks and Atlanta hope similar reactions in other cities will be launched as a result. This is the brainchild of Hawks CEO Steve Koonin and was inspired by recent social justice protests and equality rallies in the city. Koonin was especially moved by the surge of voices among young people, a group that in the past represented the lowest amount of registered voters in elections. Koonin said: \u201cIf nothing came out of this protest to create change, then we all failed.\u201d The Hawks seized the chance to enhance their community involvement, and since their home court wasn\u2019t scheduled to be used for games or concerts or other canceled events because of the coronavirus, the idea was floated for it to serve another and perhaps greater purpose. City officials pounced and the partnership was instantly formed. The Hawks will help retrofit the arena, offer free parking to those voters who can\u2019t or won\u2019t use public transportation, and train their own employees to serve as workers \u2014 some of whom are expected to be players and front office officials as well. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce, who has been active with his voice and efforts in the city and community during the last month, was onboard instantly. \u201cI\u2019m excited and our players are excited and we will use this opportunity to engage with our community,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe want to be the model for voting and making this a reality and leading the charge to get the rest of our country voting.\u201d With the virus still causing overhauls in how public places operate, Koonin said he had safety in mind with regard to State Farm Arena. \u201cThat was our No. 1 priority moving forward and we should be able to do this with ease,\u201d Koonin said. \u201cIn October, we will provide a spacious and safe and secure environment that will be good for social distancing. We will be able to stagger according to CDC regulations. We\u2019ll keep people moving through quickly. All staff will be in masks and there will be hand sanitizers throughout the building.This is not a library. This is a giant building with great connectivity.\u201d The Hawks and other NBA teams have heightened their community awareness levels in light of social events nationwide and the organization sought ways to assist Atlanta on multiple levels. The importance of registering to vote was a topic that Koonin, Pierce and chairman Tony Ressler discussed. The city and county have had their issues on that subject in the past and Koonin saw an opening for the Hawks to assist with the polling process. \u201cIf we want change,\u201d Koonin said, \u201cit starts at the polls.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a first for an NBA arena to be used as a polling center and city officials wondered if State Farm Arena would serve as the largest such place in the country. \u201cThis will be a super duper location for Fulton County, and in fact will become our election central,\u201d said Fulton County Chairman Robb Pitts. \u201cThis addition of State Farm Arena as an early voting location will enhance the voting experience of our citizens. We will go from the proverbial `worst\u2019 to first in November as a result of this collaboration.\u201d It\u2019s still to be determined how many machines will be used in the arena and other details, but organizers believe those will be resolved rapidly. The Hawks have laid the groundwork and foundation, which means the heavy lifting is already done. \u201cWe aim to be a community asset, and in order to fulfill that goal, we need to be more than just a basketball team,\u201d Koonin said."},{"id":27282,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/schuhmann-film-study-oklahoma-city-thunder","date":"2020-06-29","title":"Film Study: How OKC's three-guard lineup dominates in the clutch","content":" Of the 22 teams that will continue their season at Disney World in July, none have depended on clutch play more than the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder have played a league-high 42 games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Of the Thunder\u2019s 40 wins, 29 (73%) have been within five in the last five. Only the Charlotte Hornets (17\/23, 74%) had a higher ratio of wins that have come in the clutch. OKC is just 11-11 in games that weren\u2019t within five in the last five. The Thunder\u2019s success in close games overlaps with their success with all three of their playmaking guards \u2013 Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder \u2013 on the floor. OKC has outscored its opponents by an incredible 28.6 points per 100 possessions in 401 total minutes with the three guards on the floor. That\u2019s the best on-court NetRtg , by a healthy margin, among 602 three-man combinations that have played at least 300 minutes together. More than half (212) of those minutes have come in the fourth quarter or overtime, with 104 of those counting as \u201cclutch\u201d minutes. The Thunder have outscored their opponents by 268 total points in those 401 minutes ( 32.1 per 48 ) with all three guards in the game, and they\u2019ve been outscored by 111 points in 2,691 minutes otherwise. They have twice as many wins ( they\u2019re 16-20 ) as any other team in games they trailed after the third quarter. Though the three guards have averaged less than seven minutes per game together, those minutes have been *the difference between a loss and a win 13 times this season. (*Example: In a four-point win in Phoenix on Jan. 31, the Thunder were a plus-22 in 9:46 with all three on the floor and outscored by 18 points in 38:14 otherwise.) There are 11 players that have shot better than 50% on at least 40 clutch field goal attempts. Three of the 11 are Gilgeous-Alexander (57.4%), Paul (53.5%) and Schroder (51.1%). Very little of that clutch scoring has been a result of passing. The Thunder have had the league\u2019s most efficient clutch offense (124.0 points scored per 100 possessions) with its lowest clutch assist rate (by a wide margin), having recorded assists on just 33.8% of their clutch baskets. Paul (4\/46), Gilgeous-Alexander (5\/27) and Schroder (10\/24) have been assisted on less than 20% of their 97 total clutch buckets. It\u2019s very much a my turn, your turn situation. In 1,387 minutes total minutes on the floor together, Paul and Gilgeous-Alexander have just 48 total assists to each other. In the Rockets\u2019 iso-heavy offense, James Harden and Russell Westbrook have 122 total assists to each other in fewer ( 1,348 ) minutes on the floor together. But the three guards have been effective enough when it\u2019s been their turn. The Thunder are the only team with three players \u2013 Gilgeous-Alexander, Paul and Schroder \u2013 that have averaged at least seven pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game , according to Synergy play-type tracking. And they\u2019re the only team with three guys (same three) that have averaged at least 10 drives per game . Previous editions of this series have noted the off-the-dribble success of the Celtics and Jazz . Overall, the Thunder, who rank 14th offensively this season, haven\u2019t been as efficient as either of those two teams. Both Boston and Utah have more off-the-dribble weapons than OKC, which doesn\u2019t bring all three of its weapons together until the last few minutes of each half. When they\u2019ve brought all three weapons together, the Thunder have been ridiculously good. In their last 24 appearances together, the trio of Gilgeous-Alexander, Paul and Schroder had a negative plus-minus just three times. The supporting cast has been solid. Danilo Gallinari has the eighth highest true shooting percentage (61.1%) among the 55 players averaging at least 18 points per game. Steven Adams has been huge on the glass, while Nerlens Noel has been both efficient offensively and disruptive defensively off the bench. (The screen-setting of both centers has also been critical to the Thunder\u2019s off-the-dribble attack.) Luguentz Dort and Terrance Ferguson are two more reasons why the Thunder have a top-10 defense for a fourth straight season. But the Thunder\u2019s success in the clutch has been driven by the playmakers. And they each have their own way of getting to their spots. Paul has scored 1.09 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, the second best mark among 49 players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. He has an effective field goal percentage of 54.2% on pull-up jumpers, the second best mark among 139 players who have attempted at least 100. Paul\u2019s best work sometimes comes before he uses a screen. If he doesn\u2019t have the best angle from which to attack and make sure his defender gets hit by the screen, he\u2019ll use an extra dribble or two to create that angle. Here are three examples from other points in games, followed by a few in the clutch. Play 1. After Nerlens Noel regains his footing, he sets a screen to get Paul toward the middle of the floor. But Jamal Murray \u201cices\u201d the screen. As Noel changes the angle of the screen, Paul uses one behind-the-back dribble to get Murray leaning and another to get around the new screen, which Murray gets caught in. With Nikola Jokic not ready to contest, Paul steps into a comfortable mid-range jumper. Number to know: Paul has shot 53.9% from mid-range, the best mark among 79 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts. Play 2. Noel comes over for another pick-and-roll from the right side of the floor. Paul George is initially in position to push Paul high above the screen, but a hesitation dribble gets George under the screen and Paul crosses over into a step-back 3-pointer. Number to know: Paul has taken 34.7% of his shots from 3-point range, down from a career-high 49.3% last season . That\u2019s the fourth biggest drop among 200 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. Play 3. Noel sets up for a screen at the top of the floor and Paul sets up Georges Niang with a crossover from left to right. He then crosses back over to the left, puts Niang behind him, draws help from Ed Davis, and tosses a lob to the rolling Noel. Number to know: The Thunder have scored a league-best 1.25 points per possession on roll-man possessions, according to Synergy tracking. Play 4. Gallinari and Noel set up for a double-drag screen in transition. An in-and-out dribble gets Buddy Hield leaning toward the first screen as Paul goes the other way. He draws help from Nemanja Bjelica, setting up Gallinari for an open 3-pointer from the top. Number to know: Paul has assisted on 59 of Gallinari\u2019s 3-pointers. That\u2019s the second most assists on 3-pointers from one player to a single teammate, trailing only Bam Adebayo\u2019s 70 assists on Duncan Robinson 3-pointers . Play 5. After Ferguson\u2019s second screen gets Miles Bridges switched onto Paul, he gets both Bridges and Cody Zeller leaning with a crossover from left to right. He heads back left and then \u201csnakes\u201d in front of Zeller to a pull-up jumper from the free throw line. Number to know: Paul (17-for-27), Schroder (7-for-13) and Gilgeous-Alexander (6-for-9) are a combined 30-for-49 (61.2%) on clutch mid-range shots this season. Play 6. Like Murray in the first play, Josh Okogie initially gets between Paul and the screener. Gallinari gets out of the way and Adams steps up for another screen. Paul gets Okogie leaning left and then uses a hard crossover to run him into Adams. Another mid-range pull-up puts the Thunder up four. Number to know: Paul has been assisted on just 18.0% of his field goals. That\u2019s up from 13.9% with the Rockets last season , but still the third lowest rate among 164 players with at least 200 field goals, higher than only the marks of Harden (14.3%) and Damian Lillard (17.1%). Gilgeous-Alexander has scored 0.97 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, a mark that ranks 12th among the 49 players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game and is a hair better than the marks of Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. The second-year guard doesn\u2019t pass as much as Paul, but he does get to the line. Gilgeous-Alexander has drawn fouls on 8.8% of his drives, the 11th highest rate among the 46 players who have averaged at least 10 drives per game. He\u2019ll take some indirect paths to the basket. Gilgeous-Alexander will frequently \u201csnake\u201d pick-and-rolls, changing direction after using the screen to keep his defender behind him and get to the middle of the paint. His last couple of steps are usually slow and deliberate, though (like a Kyrie Irving) you don\u2019t necessarily know from which foot he\u2019ll take off or with which hand he\u2019ll finish. Here are a few examples of Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s wiliness, featuring a couple of clutch buckets at the end. Play 1. In transition, Gilgeous-Alexander bumps Lonzo Ball under the basket, hits the breaks, and banks in a lefty floater. Number to know: The Thunder rank last in both fast break points (9.3) and second chance points (10.5) per game after ranking fifth (18.2) and second (15.5) last season. Play 2. Gilgeous-Alexander runs a high pick-and-roll with Adams. Jrue Holiday does a decent job of getting over the screen, but SGA takes contact from Holiday and is able to toss in another wrong-footed floater over Derrick Favors. Number to know: Gilgeous-Alexander ranks 10th in the league with 110 non-restricted-area buckets in the paint. The 44.2% he\u2019s shot on those shots ranks 28th among 95 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 3. Noel changes the angle of another screen, taking Reggie Jackson off the ball, and Gilgeous-Alexander drains a more standard floater over Ivica Zubac. Number to know: Gilgeous-Alexander has averaged 19.3 points and 6.1 rebounds, up from 10.8 and 2.8 last season . The rebounds jump (3.3 per game) is the biggest among 234 players who have played in at least 40 games in each of the last two seasons, and the points jump (8.5 per game) is the third biggest among that same group of players. Play 4. Once more, Noel changes the angle of the screen as Gilgeous-Alexander goes behind the back to put George in his rearview mirror. He snakes in front of Montrezl Harrell and gets to an open spot on the other side of the lane before George can recover. Number to know: As a team, the Thunder have averaged 25.1 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions, third most in the league . Their 0.96 points per possession on ball-handler possessions ranks fifth . Play 5. Gilgeous-Alexander uses an Adams screen to attack the middle of the floor. He gets Joel Embiid in the air with a Rondo move, and then comes back to finish around the recovering Embiid with his left hand. Number to know: The Thunder are one of three teams \u2013 the Rockets and Lakers are the others \u2013 that rank in the top 10 in three of the \u201c four factors \u201d on offense, with offensive rebounding percentage (in which they rank 29th ) being the exception. Play 6. Gilgeous-Alexander snakes another pick-and-roll and gets Jeremy Lamb on his hip. Adams rolls to the rim and sets a \u201cGortat\u201d screen on Domantas Sabonis, allowing SGA to take a foul from Lamb and still finish. Number to know: The Thunder have outscored their opponents by 5.0 points per game on free throws, the league\u2019s biggest differential by a wide margin. The next biggest is +2.7 points per game (Houston). Schroder is the one of the three who has been assisted on a decent percentage of his buckets, both clutch and non-clutch. He\u2019s been assisted on 49.5% of his field goals, the highest rate of his career and up from 33.7% last season. That\u2019s the third biggest jump among 218 players with at least 100 field goals in each of the last two seasons. With his quickness, Schroder\u2019s an ideal second-side ball-handler, able to take advantage of a rotating defense. He\u2019s also been an improved shooter. He\u2019s shot 41.5% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, up from 35.0% last season and the 20th best mark among 67 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 200. Play 1. The Thunder get a cross match in transition, with Jaxson Hayes guarding Paul. When Noel slips a screen, both Hayes and Nicolo Melli retreat into the paint, forcing E\u2019Twaun Moore to rotate over. Paul gets the ball to Schroder, who attacks Hayes\u2019 close-out, draws help from Melli, and drops the ball off to Noel. Number to know: Noel has shot 84.3% in the restricted area, the best mark among 204 players with at least 100 restricted-area attempts. Play 2. Adams comes up to set a screen for Paul, but before using it, CP3 pitches the ball to Schroder, backing up to midcourt so that he can get a running start against Frank Jackson, who has just entered the game. Number to know: Schroder has shot 62.9% in the restricted area , up from just 53.9% through his first six seasons in the league. Play 3. When Gilgeous-Alexander and Adams run a pick-and-roll from the left side of the floor, Holiday (defending Schroder) sets up at the nail. That gives Schroder a seam to attack when SGA swings the ball to the weak side. Number to know: Schroder has an effective field goal percentage of 53.2%, easily the best mark of his career and up from 47.0% last season. That\u2019s the ninth biggest jump among 200 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. Play 4. Paul, guarded by Kent Bazemore, uses screens from Schroder and Adams to attack from the left side. With Bazemore caught in the first screen, and Yogi Ferrell unable to get in front, Paul drives at Alex Len. Bazemore sinks to help on Adams\u2019 roll to the rim and Schroder is left open on the left wing. Number to know: While the Thunder have seen a drop in assist percentage (AST\/FGM), they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s second biggest increase in ball movement, from 300 passes per 24 minutes of possession (29th) last season to 326 (17th) this season, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Play 5. Set up on the weak side, Schroder attacks an opened-up Landry Shamet. He gets Shamet\u2019s momentum going left, slams on the brakes, and steps back into a 17-footer. Number to know: Schroder has shot 48.1% from mid-range, the best mark of his career and the fourth best mark among 21 players with at least 200 mid-range attempts. Play 6. Ferguson sets an initial screen for Paul to get Shamet switched onto the ball. Schroder then comes over and slips out of a screen for Paul and into an open 3-pointer from the top before the defensively challenged Lou Williams can recover. Number to know:  Paul\u2019s 76 assists to Schroder are, by far, the most from any of the three guards to one of the others. Next most is Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s 38 assists to Schroder. When all three of Paul, Schroder and Gilgeous-Alexander are on the floor, OKC is generally upgrading at the wing from a player \u2013 Dort or Ferguson \u2013 who can\u2019t shoot or do much off the dribble. That can make a huge difference for an offense that relies so much on half-court execution. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Thunder rank third in overall half-court efficiency (0.998 points per possession), trailing only Dallas (1.024) and Milwaukee (1.009). A big key to the three-guard success is that, playing small at the wings, the Thunder haven\u2019t suffered defensively. They\u2019ve allowed less than a point per possession in those 401 minutes with all three on the floor and part of that success has been an increase in opponent turnover rate (which Kemba Walker knows something about ). The Thunder have forced 14.0 turnovers per 100 possessions ( 19th in the league ) overall, but have forced 15.5 per 100 with Paul, Schroder and Gilgeous-Alexander all in the game. Part of the defensive success has also come from opponent 3-point shooting. The Thunder are the only team that ranks in the top 10 in both opponent 3-point percentage (34.4%, fifth ) and the (lowest) percentage of their opponent shots that have come from 3-point range (36.9%, seventh). The latter has been higher (39.2%), but the former has been much lower 30.9% with all three guards on the floor. Opponents shooting 30.9% from 3-point range is not sustainable. Neither is the 61.2% that Paul, Schroder and Gilgeous-Alexander have shot on clutch mid-range shots. There\u2019s obviously some luck in just how good OKC has been when the three have played together. The Thunder are still going to be better when they play their best players. And the postseason should allow them to play the three guards together for more than just seven minutes per game. This was the third best team in the league (34-13) after Thanksgiving, and it hadn\u2019t yet optimized its rotation. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

With these jerseys, it doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d Personalized messages on the back of jerseys is one of many ways the NBA and NBPA plan to amplify social justice causes during the season comeback in Orlando. Last week, the NBA and NBPA announced that sparking societal change would be the goal of the restart. While players will not be forced to wear a message, Paul says they will provide a list of suggestions for players looking for a cause to support. According to ESPN, these messages could include phrases (like \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d), names of social justice organizations, or the names of individuals who were killed by the police. \u201cThe guys I talked to were definitely excited,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m passionate and excited about it is that it gives a voice to the voiceless. It also gives guys a chance to shine a light on something they are passionate about. Otherwise, they may not have been given a chance to express themselves.\u201d Players and teams have been active at protests across the country , and on social media, to fight for social justice and the end to police brutality. Paul told ESPN the NBPA plans to reach out to the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, Trayvon Martin and others whose deaths have sparked outrage across the country to get their permission to wear their names. \u201cI was just thinking about how forward-thinking our league is and how passionate the players in our league are about different issues,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOur guys have been marching on the front lines and using their platforms.

Eight seeding games during the NBA\u2019s restart in Orlando set the stage for that. But by now you should know better than to think the Spurs are singularly focused on just the playoffs. \u201cFirst and foremost, obviously we want to go and perform well,\u201d general manager Brian Wright said. \u201cObviously, we finished the season strong [with] a good win versus Dallas [on March 10] before things were shut down. We want to continue to do that, continue to grow as a team, continue to grow as a unit. \u201cBut guys haven\u2019t been playing basketball for three months. So, there is going to be a focus on making sure we\u2019re keeping our guys healthy and how we best do that. We want to go play well. We want to go compete. We want to finish the season strong. But we\u2019re also going to keep in mind the health and safety of our players and everybody as we return.\u201d > Season comeback schedule released > The 8 seeding games every team will play The quest for a 23rd straight postseason berth starts July 31st, against the Sacramento Kings, without the help of power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, the team\u2019s second-leading scorer (18.9 points per game) and leading rebounder (7.4 rebounds per game). A seven-time NBA All-Star, Aldridge underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression and rotator cuff debridement on his right shoulder on April 24 in Dallas. The club announced June 8 that Aldridge would miss the remainder of the season, and h e won\u2019t be with the team in Orlando. So, while San Antonio sets its sights on seizing sole possession of the NBA\u2019s record for consecutive playoff appearances, it also understands where it is at this stage of the game, having dealt with the retirements of future Hall of Famers Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili over the past four seasons, as well as the departure of Kawhi Leonard, now a star with the LA Clippers. No doubt, San Antonio\u2019s schedule sets them up favorably (we\u2019ll get into that later) heading into the NBA\u2019s restart at Florida\u2019s sprawling Walt Disney World Resort. But let\u2019s not forget the Spurs are sitting at 27-36, good for 12th in the Western Conference standings and 4.0 games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot. They\u2019re also teeming with unproven young talent in guards Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV, as well as rookie first-round pick Keldon Johnson. So for the Spurs, Walt Disney World Resort becomes not just the greatest place on Earth, but also the best venue to evaluate their young prospects. \u201cI think in the last few weeks of the season, you got to see a little bit of Keldon Johnson and what he brings to the table,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see that growth and development from a lot of our young guys. So, those games are important for us to evaluate and for them to continue to grow. Coach [Gregg Popovich] controls the minutes. But it\u2019s obviously a great chance for them to continue their development process that they started at the beginning of the season. The No. 29 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, Murray was averaging 10.7 points, 4.1 assists and 1.7 steals before the NBA suspended play almost four months ago due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the world still hasn\u2019t yet seen Murray\u2019s full potential after he missed the entire 2018-19 season with a torn right ACL. White, meanwhile, flashed two-way talent in the opening-round playoff series last season against the Denver Nuggets, but has started in just 13 games this season, averaging 10.4 points and 3.4 assists. By far San Antonio\u2019s most explosive player, Walker dropped a career-high 28 points in a double-overtime win over Houston, but he\u2019s started in just four games this season as Popovich has worked closely with the second-year man to harness his intensity and playmaking ability. Walker has averaged 14.5 minutes in 2019-20, shooting 43.4% from the floor and 40.8% from deep. \u201cThe young dudes we\u2019ve got, we\u2019ve got a special group of young dudes,\u201d Walker told Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports on Wednesday. \u201cEverybody I see, man, they got better every day. If you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re going to know who Dejounte is when I get the opportunity, just unleashed 110 percent. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare me with a guy who plays 35 minutes. You can\u2019t compare Derrick White to a guy that plays 35 minutes. You\u2019re not seeing the best of Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Bryn Forbes or Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl. You\u2019re not seeing the best of us because we\u2019re still earning our stripes behind closed doors, but also trying to gain trust from our coaches and our teammates.\u201d That all starts on July 31 when San Antonio opens the NBA\u2019s restart against the Sacramento Kings. Throughout the Spurs\u2019 entire schedule of seeding games, they play just one back-to-back set on Aug. 2 and Aug. 3 against the Memphis Grizzlies and Philadelphia 76ers. Of the eight seeding games on the team\u2019s schedule, just four outings \u2014 including two against the Utah Jazz \u2014 come against postseason participants from a year ago. Just three of those matchups \u2014 Aug. 5 against Denver, Aug. 7 and Aug. 13 against Utah \u2014 come against squads currently seeded in the top four of their conferences. Favorable schedule aside, the Spurs didn\u2019t even get back into their practice facility to resume training until June 8, as they worked with local health officials to determine when to reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for them to continue playing, continue development,\u201d Wright said. \u201cTo pull something like this off is a tremendous undertaking. I think the league looked at a lot of different options in a return to play. This one fit best for a multitude of reasons. \u201cSo, we\u2019re happy that we have eight games, and we have an opportunity to compete and get a chance to play in the playoffs. It\u2019s going to be a huge adjustment. And to know what it will take, we won\u2019t really know until we get into that bubble. But I know the guys want to compete and crown a champion this season. We\u2019re fortunate to get the opportunity to do that.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The 88 seeding games, which were selected from the remaining 259 regular-season matchups, will count toward the final 2019-20 regular-season standings and regular-season statistics. In the first step of the selection process for the seeding games, the matchups were chosen chronologically, starting from March 11, except in these instances: \u2022 A matchup featured a non-participating team \u2022 A matchup resulted in either team in the matchup exceeding eight total games \u2022 A matchup prevented any participating team from having eight feasible matchups The second step in the selection process was matchup balancing. There were eight instances in which selecting matchups chronologically prevented a matchup that was scheduled to be played two more times in the remainder of the regular season from being included among the seeding games. In those cases, one instance of that matchup was added as a seeding game, and instances of repeat matchups as seeding games were removed where possible. For example: Milwaukee\u2019s two remaining regular-season matchups against the Washington Wizards were scheduled to be played on March 21 and 27 and their two remaining regular-season matchups against the Brooklyn Nets were scheduled to be played on April 9 and 15. If matchups for seeding games were selected in chronological order only, then the Bucks would have been scheduled to play the Wizards twice and the Nets zero times. To balance the matchups, one instance of a Bucks-Nets matchup was added as a seeding game and one instance of a Bucks-Wizards matchup was removed as a seeding game. The seeding games will conclude on Aug. 14. If a play-in is required to determine the eighth playoff seed in either conference, it will take place on Aug. 15-16.

For teams like the Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks, LA Clippers, Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics, there is security in the lofty positions earned through the first portion of the season, before the coronavirus forced a suspension in play. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can shift to cruise control. > Season comeback schedule released > The 8 seeding games every team will play > Everything you need to know about season comeback > Silver touts \u2018safe, responsible\u2019 plan for season comeback >  Analysis: Breaking down all 30 teams ahead of season resumption While every team will want to find a good groove immediately \u2014 in an unprecedented format, in a city and environment that will be foreign to all but the hometown Orlando Magic \u2014 certain teams will need to manage things more tightly as the pecking order sorts itself out over the quick two-week sprint to end the regular season. With home court advantage no longer a factor for any of the 22 teams involved \u2014 not the highest seeds or any of the teams still clinging to the dream \u2014 seeding numbers remain an integral part of the process. Here\u2019s a quick look at what we could see: Denver The Nuggets are sitting in the right spot headed to Orlando but they can ill afford to take their final eight games for granted. With Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston trailing them by just 2.5 games in the loss column, the difference between the No. 3 and No. 7 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase is a stumble or two away. Dallas The Mavericks are actually better than their record indicates; they were on the losing end of many close games. But with a healthier group, and the Thunder and Rockets focused on each other, there could be an opening for Luka Doncic and his crew to make a move up and possibly avoid the Clippers in the first round. Utah Working without second-leading scorer Bojan Bogdanovic ( wrist surgery ) is a big blow for a Jazz team that needs all its offensive firepower to make a deep playoff run. The chemistry between All-Stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert has to be on point from the start. Will it be ? We\u2019ll see. Philadelphia: Easily the most perplexing team in the league before the shutdown, the Sixers have a chance to start healthy and fresh in Orlando. And Tobias Harris isn\u2019t shy about trumpeting the Sixers\u2019 championship aspirations or the fact that the chemistry was way off previously. Reconciling those things is critical immediately, especially for Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Oh, and no more road games. Great news for the Sixers, who were 10-24 on the road before the stoppage. Indiana: First there were injuries, then a significant roster overhaul. And now Malcolm Brogdon has to recover from a positive COVID-19 test . That\u2019s just the latest obstacle for a Pacers team that continues to fly under the radar headed to Orlando. Brogdon and Victor Oladipo have to click from the start. The best part for the Pacers? A head-to-head matchup with the Sixers in the very first game. Oklahoma City: Chris Paul drove this Thunder team into the mix for a top four seed despite expectations that weren\u2019t anything close externally. Now that the Thunder are in a position to chase that spot, you can expect CP3 to be at his most demanding with so much on the line. Houston: The Rockets are on even footing in the West with a Thunder team every bit as motivated to prove their critics wrong as James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s small-ball crew. The shutdown couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for a Rockets team that was running on fumes. Brooklyn: As expected, the Nets will show up in Orlando without their two biggest stars, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re playing to avoid Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in that first-round playoff matchup. The hometown Magic will start in the same space in the standings but the desire to avoid the Bucks is much greater for the crew from Brooklyn, who have no wiggle room. Orlando: Steve Clifford has to be tired of waiting for the invasion of teams to his team\u2019s stomping grounds. What would normally be seen as an advantage could be anything but if the Magic don\u2019t get off to a good start. Aside from the Lakers, Bucks and Clippers, is there any team with more pressure on them to perform, given the circumstances? New Orleans: This 88-game conclusion to the regular season provides everyone with what they wanted most: More Zion Williamson. We\u2019d only seen glimpses and flashes of the Pelicans\u2019 dynamic rookie when the season was interrupted. Now we get to see what a rested, recharged and rejuvenated Zion looks like with a playoff opportunity at stake. The Pelicans had the easiest remaining schedule when the season was suspended and will have the easiest schedule in Orlando. They\u2019re the only team with a cumulative opponent winning percentage below .500, with six of their eight games (each of the last six) against the nine bubble teams that currently have losing records. Portland: They voted against the 22-team comeback format, but no team stands to gain more after the long layoff than the Blazers. With healthy bodies like Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins added to the core of Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum and Carmelo Anthony, this could well be the most dangerous team in the entire comeback season. Memphis: The Grizzlies had the roughest remaining schedule of any team before the shutdown. They were going to have to fend off challengers from every direction to hold onto the eighth and final spot in the Western Conference. Rookie sensation Ja Morant looked to be ready for the fight. But what about now? The Grizzlies\u2019 three most important games are their first three (Trail Blazers, Spurs, Pelicans). \u2022 The Lakers see the biggest jump in cumulative opponent winning percentage from what they had on their remaining schedule on March 11 (0.471, 18th-toughest among the 22 teams) to the bubble schedule (0.625, 3rd). The next biggest jumps belong to the Heat (from 14th-toughest to 2nd), Raptors (from 7th to 1st), and the Blazers (from 16th to 5th). \u2022 The Wizards are the only team with a lower cumulative opponent winning percentage in the bubble (0.578, 10th toughest) than they had remaining on March 11 (0.583, 1st). Other teams benefiting from new schedule are the Grizzlies (from 2nd-toughest run to 6th), Mavs (4th to 15th) and Nets (8th to 19th). Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

And probably will remain so right through The Finals championship trophy presentation sometime in October. \u201cWe can\u2019t outrun the virus,\u201d Silver said in a media conference call Friday afternoon that featured other league executives as well as National Basketball Players Association leaders Michele Roberts, Chris Paul and Andre Iguodala. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to be living with for the foreseeable future,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThis is a closed network. While it\u2019s not impermeable, it is protected.\u201d All remaining games will be played in a \u201cbubble\u201d concept at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, with players, coaches and staff working under strict health and safety protocols to minimize the risk from COVID-19. The NBA shut down its season on March 11 as the coronavirus pandemic began to spread across the nation. The league, the players association, public health specialists and government officials worked on the program to resume. The version to be played out at Disney: Twenty-two teams competing first through a schedule of eight \u201cseeding games,\u201d a possible play-in layer for No. 8 and No. 9 seeds, followed by the traditional NBA playoff bracket of four rounds of best-of-seven series, allowing for a 2020 champion to be crowned. Notice that word \u201ctraditional,\u201d though? That\u2019s about the only part of this resumption that will be. No fans will be in attendance for the games, and participants\u2019 families and friends will be permitted into the \u201cbubble\u201d only after the playoffs\u2019 first round. They, too, will be headquartered and held to the same precautions as the players and coaches. All will undergo coronavirus testing daily, at least initially, Silver said. Concerns in recent days about an increase in positive test results both in Florida and nationally raised questions about the restart. How would a positive test of an NBA superstar be handled, for example. And how many positives would be too many, possibly causing the entire operation to be scuttled? \u201cIf we have a single player test positive, whether an All-Star or a journeyman, that player would go into quarantine,\u201d Silver said. Then medical personnel would track others with whom that player had contact. As far as stopping a playoff series for a single positive \u2014 whether LeBron James or a deep reserve \u2014 Silver said the league would \u201ctreat that positive test as we would an injury.\u201d A cluster of players on one team testing positive or a spate of COVID-19 cases across the campus would force the league and health officials to react in real time. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to say there\u2019s nothing that would cause us to change our plans,\u201d the commissioner said, adding that no definitive number of tolerable positives exists for now. The NBA and the NBPA jointly announced Friday the results of coronavirus testing conducted on Tuesday. Of the 302 players tested, 16 came back positive. Those players will remain in self-isolation until he satisfies public health protocols and has been cleared by a physician. Asked about that outcome, Roberts, the union\u2019s executive director, said that even one positive is a concern. But she added: \u201cIf nothing else, it tells me that the great majority of players have been doing what they should have been doing. \u2026 One is too many, but 160 would have been devastating.\u201d Silver said the 5.3 percent positive rate was in line with what the league\u2019s data suggested, accounting for factors such as age group and locale. He noted that none of the 16 players is seriously ill. David Weiss, the NBA senior vice president who oversees player health programs, said on the call the league\u2019s partnership with Advent Health will ensure a clinic is maintained within the campus. Local hospitals in the Orlando area will be used if someone gets seriously ill. In tackling the restart, the NBA is trying to thread multiple priorities through the eye of a needle. Financial considerations are huge, given the hundreds of millions and potentially billions of dollars lost due to the shutdown. NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum declined to estimate the amount of revenue that might be salvaged by the plan and the postseason\u2019s completion. The health and safety of those participating is essential, Silver, Roberts and others have said repeatedly. And then there are issues of social justice and the NBA players and coaches motivated to voice their views, given the civil unrest stemming from black civilian George Floyd\u2019s killing on a Minneapolis street while in the custory of four police officers. Several players, including Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving and Lakers\u2019 Dwight Howard and Avery Bradley, wondered if the restart might interfere or send the wrong message at a time when protests and riots were breaking out in many cities. Where the NBA and the players union landed, though, was that the platform provided by the restart \u2014 with all involved gathered in one place to amplify their voices \u2014 might be the best way for them to speak out and lead. \u201cA beacon of light,\u201d NBPA vice president Andre Iguodala said, acknowledging the impact of the virus on jobs and fans, as well as the unrest in the streets. Said Chris Paul, president of the players union: \u201cI\u2019m excited for what we can do that is a lot bigger than the game. \u2026 It\u2019s never a \u2018shut up and dribble\u2019 situation. You\u2019re going to continue to hear us.\u201d Silver talked about creating an NBA foundation, a first for the league, as an independent organization that would \u201chelp drive change with us.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on us not to lose this moment. We will have the world\u2019s attention.\u201d The health issues alone are vast. As if the virus weren\u2019t enough, the potential for basketball injuries after such an unprecedented layoff and relatively rapid return to games that pack more urgency than those played in November is a concern. Then there\u2019s the unknown of how players might be affected by the unique challenges of the \u201cbubble\u201d concept. Most Americans have had to deal with the unusual circumstances of sheltering in place, altering their routines and coping with financial and emotional hits due to the lockdowns. Now the NBA will send its extended family into a whole new version of reality of social distancing, masks and other precautions, huddled in one location and cut off from their homes and (for a while) loved ones. Paul credited NBA colleagues Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan for opening up in recent years about challenges of stress and anxiety for players, even seemingly comfortable, wealthy and successful performers. They \u201cgave us all a comfort level in speaking about this,\u201d Paul said. It\u2019s a complicated, precarious, exhilarating, fascinating and unprecedented journey on which the NBA officially has embarked. Bumps along the way are all but guaranteed, but the time, cost and effort invested so far \u2014 and what the league considers its prospects for success \u2014 makes the departure worthwhile. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve developed a safe and responsible plan to restart the season,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe ultimately believe it will be safer on our campus than outside of it. But this is definitely not business as usual.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The NBA and the NBPA confirmed today an agreement on health and safety protocols that will govern the resumption of the season. The rigorous program, which addresses risks related to COVID-19 and focuses on the well-being of players, coaches, officials and staff, was developed in consultation with public health experts, infectious disease specialists and government officials. As announced on Wednesday, the NBA and the NBPA have agreed in principle that the goal of the season restart will be to find tangible and sustainable ways to address racial inequality across the country. Leaders from the NBA and the NBPA have also discussed strategies to increase Black representation across the NBA and its teams, ensure greater inclusion of Black-owned and operated businesses across NBA business activities, and form an NBA foundation to expand educational and economic development opportunities across the Black community.

The restart will begin with each participating team playing eight \u201cseeding games,\u201d as selected from its remaining regular-season matchups. The complete game and national television schedules for the seeding games will be announced tonight. The NBA and its broadcast and technology partners are collaborating to enhance game telecasts and bring fans an immersive, interactive viewing experience.  At the conclusion of the seeding games, the seven teams in each conference with the highest combined winning percentages across regular-season games and seeding games will be the first through seventh seeds for the NBA Playoffs for that conference. If the team with the eighth-best combined winning percentage (regular-season games and seeding games) in a conference is more than four games ahead of the team with the ninth-best combined winning percentage in the same conference, then the team with the eighth-best winning percentage would be the eighth playoff seed in that conference. If the team with the eighth-best combined winning percentage in a conference (Team 8) is four games or fewer ahead of the team with the ninth-best combined winning percentage in the same conference (Team 9), then those two teams would compete in a play-in tournament to determine the eighth playoff seed in the conference. The play-in tournament will be double elimination for Team 8 and single elimination for Team 9. The NBA\u2019s standard playoff tiebreaker procedures will be used to break any ties on the basis of winning percentage. Once the 16-team playoff field is set, the NBA Playoffs will proceed in a traditional conference-based format with four rounds and best-of-seven series in each round.

In an interview on the \u201cWinging It with Vince Carter\u201d podcast via The Ringer Network, the former eight-time All-Star and Rookie of the Year winner left no doubt about his playing days being over. \u201cI\u2019m officially finished playing basketball,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI\u2019m officially done playing basketball professionally.\u201d The announcement was largely a formality because the 43-year-old Carter had said many times over the course of this season that this would be his last in the NBA. His 22 seasons are the most in league history, and he became the first NBA player to appear in four different decades. Atlanta is one of eight teams whose COVID-19-interrupted season ended when the league decided to resume play with 22 teams in Florida next month. The Hawks played their final game of 2019-20 on March 11, a 136-131 loss to the New York Knicks in which Carter got in the game and sank a 3-pointer with 13.4 seconds left in overtime. Carter said making that last shot helped make his NBA exit a little easier to swallow. \u201cMaking my last shot helped the situation. I think if I didn\u2019t make my last shot, it\u2019d have been a little different. It\u2019d have felt a little different. I\u2019d have been itching to, at least get back and just play one minute and just make one shot \u2014 I don\u2019t care what it would be: free throw, layup, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Carter said. \u201cAs a player playing your last game \u2014 whether you know it or not \u2014 you always want to say, \u2018well, at least I made the last shot of my career.\u2019 And I can actually say that, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic also played a big part in Carter\u2019s decision to retire, particularly how it was affecting the United States and world at large. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say since March 11 (I knew I was going to retire), I\u2019m not going to say since that day, but pretty close,\u201d Carter said. \u201cSince the end of March \u2014 we\u2019ve talked about it \u2014 I felt that it was pretty much over. That\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve handled it. It made for, if there was any disappointment because of the season or any of that, it was easier to put it aside and handle it that way. It\u2019s something bigger than my career. \u201cWith the coronavirus, it was taking people\u2019s lives rapidly \u2014 that\u2019s the big picture in my mind. I was able to put the weird ending, the abrupt stoppage of play to an ending, aside for the bigger picture. Obviously you\u2019re worried about family, friends \u2026 as you go further on, there\u2019s always going to be somebody close to you or pretty close by way of somebody that\u2019s been affected by it.\u201d Since being away from the game, Carter said he has had more time to play golf, which he says has helped ease his transition from being an active player to retirement. When Carter began his NBA career with the Toronto Raptors in 1998, the NBA was in the midst of a bitter labor dispute that wiped out most of the first half of his rookie season. The NBA is restarting its season on July 30 in Orlando, but neither Carter nor the Hawks will be a part of that. Still, Carter said he was able to appreciate the sort of symmetry his career has in starting his career in a shortened season and ending it in a similar fashion. \u201cIt is official. It wasn\u2019t like a shocking blow [to be left out of the 22-team field]. It wasn\u2019t like a painful blow hearing it or reading it, because I kind of was already there,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward, but it\u2019s kind of a cool situation for me because I came into the league in a shortened season and I walk away from the league on a shortened season. For me, it was just kind of a unique situation.\u201d The Hawks quickly lauded Carter for what he\u2019s done, not just in two years with Atlanta but over the totality of his career. \u201cThroughout his historic 22-year journey covering an unprecedented four different decades, his evolving career arc was perhaps like none other in league history \u2014 from Top 5 Draft Pick to Rookie of the Year to Slam Dunk Champion to superstar and eight-time All-Star to Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year and valuable role player,\u201d the Hawks said in a statement. In January, Carter became the first player in NBA history to appear in a game in four different decades . Although he is perhaps best known for his seasons with the Raptors, Carter also played for the New Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings before spending the final two seasons of his career with the Hawks. A two-time All-NBA team selection in his career, Carter leaves the NBA ranked No. 19 on the all-time scoring list. He is also in the top 10 in virtually every category in Raptors history , including points scored (4th), assists (6th), steals (5th), blocks (4th), field goals made (3rd) and 3-pointers made (5th).

Team officials made the announcement by posting Brogdon\u2019s statement on Twitter. \u201cI recently tested positive for the COVID virus and am currently in quarantine,\u201d the statement read. \u201cI\u2019m doing well, feeling well and progressing well. I plan to join my teammates in Orlando for the resumption of the NBA season and playoffs.\u201d Indiana began testing players earlier this week and is scheduled to arrive in Orlando in early July to resume full practices. NBA officials have announced they will quarantine teams for 24 hours before practices can begin. It\u2019s also not the first time the Pacers organization has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Myles Turner\u2019s father was hospitalized in Texas with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, but has recovered. Brogdon wasn\u2019t healthy before the season was suspended, sitting out with a leg and hip muscle injury. But the stoppage allowed him to recover. He was averaging 16.3 points, 7.1 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 48 games this season, his first with Indiana. \u201cMalcolm says he\u2019s 100 percent, ready to go,\u201d president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said in mid-April. \u201cHe is hungry.\u201d Brogdon also has become a prominent voice speaking out against racial injustice. He and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics spoke at protest in Atlanta following the death of George Floyd. Brogdon has said he hopes to lead a march in Indianapolis, though he did not speak at one held two weeks ago in Indy. His grandfather, John Hurst Adams, marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s civil rights movement. But with other NBA players voicing concerns about resuming the season amid the continuing protests, Brogdon had decided he would play. \u201cI think guys across the NBA have very, very mixed views, and it\u2019s very polarized. Some don\u2019t want to play, and I understand that,\u201d he said earlier this month. Brogdon\u2019s test result raises another question about the Pacers roster. The Indianapolis Star has reported backup guard Justin Holiday may not play and two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo told ESPN.com on Saturday he intended to ramp up his activities with the team this week before making a decision. Oladipo returned to the court in late January following from a year-long recovery from a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee and was just rounding into form when play stopped. If Oladipo does play, the Pacers intend to be cautious with their star."},{"id":27306,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kings-alex-len-jabari-parker-coronavirus","date":"2020-06-25","title":"Kings' Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Buddy Hield test positive for COVID-19","content":" Sacramento Kings players Alex Len, Jabari Parker and Buddy Hield have each tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

But it wasn\u2019t the percentage that mattered. It was the attempts. Robinson, who went undrafted in 2018 and played a total of 161 minutes as a rookie, was suddenly an indiscriminate gunner in the Miami Heat\u2019s starting lineup. His 13.1 3-point attempts per 36 minutes were topped only (among 84 players who played at least 100 preseason minutes) by a pair of Houston Rockets. Here was Robinson\u2019s first touch of the preseason, where he immediately launched a contested 3-pointer with 15 seconds on the shot clock:  In the regular season, Robinson has averaged just 10.0 3-point attempts per 36, sixth among players that have played at least 750 minutes. But he\u2019s shot them at a 44.8% clip. He ranks fourth in the league in 3-point percentage, having attempted more 3-pointers (543) than anybody else in the top 35. The addition of Jimmy Butler is one reason why the Heat have had the league\u2019s second most improved offense. When the season went on hiatus, Miami ranked seventh on that end of the floor , having scored 5.5 more points per 100 possessions than it did last season, when it was a bottom-five offensive team . Butler has fueled the league\u2019s biggest jump in free throw rate (FTA\/FGA), from 0.247 ( 20th ) last season to 0.298 ( first ) this season. He has an individual free throw rate of 67.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field, the second highest rate among 229 players with at least 300 field goal attempts (lower than only that of Rudy Gobert). But the Heat have also seen the league\u2019s biggest increase in effective field goal percentage, from 51.5% ( 21st ) last season to 54.9% ( third ) this season. That\u2019s come with the league\u2019s biggest jump in 3-point percentage, from 34.9% ( 21st ) last season to 38.3% ( first ) this season. Butler has generated some of those shots, ranking 23rd in the league with 142 assists on 3-pointers. But he\u2019s shot a brutal 24.8% from beyond the arc himself. That\u2019s the third worst mark among 242 players with at least 100 3-point attempts. While he\u2019s given them a playmaker who gets to the line more (per field goal attempt) than James Harden, the Heat\u2019s offensive improvement has been about a lot more than Butler, who has an effective field goal percentage of 33.8% on shots from outside the paint, the worst mark (by a wide margin) among 183 players who have taken at least 200 shots from the outside. Bam Adebayo seeing one of the league\u2019s biggest jumps in minutes per game (from 23.3 to 34.4) has mattered. Goran Dragic being healthy has mattered. Having two rookies \u2014 Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro \u2014 who can get buckets has mattered. Getting 43% from 3-point range from both Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Leonard has mattered. But the biggest revelation from the Heat might be the guy who started his college career at Division III Williams college, played 161 minutes last season, and has suddenly become one of the league\u2019s scariest 3-point shooters. You could say that Robinson\u2019s offensive game is one-dimensional. He\u2019s taken 89% of his shots from 3-point range, the highest rate among 229 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. And he\u2019s been assisted on 94.1% of his baskets , the highest rate among 164 players with 200 total field goals. But Robinson gets to those assisted 3-pointers in a lot of creative ways. And while his own offense is limited, the threat of his shooting opens up a lot of other elements of the Heat\u2019s seventh-ranked offense. Butler is the star and Adebayo is the hub. But the Heat\u2019s primary offensive actions are often designed for Robinson to get open beyond the arc. Here are a few examples of how he gets his shots: Play 1. A lot of teams will run this \u201cpistol\u201d action for good shooters (like Joe Harris with Brooklyn). Kyle Lowry prevents Nunn from using Robinson\u2019s screen along the right sideline, but Robinson still gets open via a flare to the top of the floor, with help from Adebayo\u2019s screen on Fred VanVleet. Number to know: Adebayo ranks third with 5.2 screen assists per game. Play 2. As Dragic and Olynyk run a pick-and-roll at the top of the floor, Robinson runs along the baseline and eventually curls around an Andre Iguodala screen in the right corner. Number to know: Robinson\u2019s ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts is 38.8. That\u2019s the third highest ratio among 183 players who have taken at least 200 shots from outside the paint, trailing only the marks of Ben McLemore ( infinity ) and James Harden (48.1). Play 3. Now, things get a little more interesting. Most dribble hand-offs are for a player coming from the wing or the corner. Here, Robinson starts at the right block, as if he\u2019s setting a back-screen for Derrick Jones Jr. The threat of a lob to Jones keeps Markelle Fultz from staying attached to Robinson as he sprints into a hand-off from Olynyk above the left elbow. Number to know: According to Synergy play-type tracking, Robinson leads the league with 3.2 points per game scored off hand-offs. Play 4. Robinson again starts at the right block. This time he flashes straight to the ball. De\u2019Anthony Melton anticipates a hand-off back to Butler, but Robinson immediately pivots toward a screen from Leonard and Melton can\u2019t recover quickly enough. Number to know: The Heat have scored 120.1 points per 100 possessions in the first quarter, the best mark for any team in any quarter. Play 5. With Robinson on the left side of the floor, Adebayo goes in the other direction with a dribble hand-off to Butler. Future teammate Jae Crowder forces Butler baseline, Leonard ad-libs a back-screen for Robinson back to the left corner, and Butler delivers the \u201chammer\u201d pass. Number to know: The Heat\u2019s lineup of Nunn, Robinson, Butler, Adebayo and Leonard has averaged 96.3 possessions per 48 minutes, the slowest pace among the 50 lineups that have played at least 150 minutes together. Adebayo and the Pacers\u2019 Domantas Sabonis are the closest facsimiles to Nikola Jokic, around whom the Nuggets have built a top-10 (and entertaining) offense . Adebayo will dribble the ball up and initiate the offense himself from the top of the floor. Among centers, only Jokic (34.3%) has recorded assists on a higher percentage of his possessions than Adebayo (23.2%). Adebayo leads all centers (and ranks eighth overall) with 176 assists on 3-pointers, 70 of which have gone to Robinson. That\u2019s the most assists on 3-pointers from one player to a single teammate. Here are a few of those connections: Play 1. This is a pretty common set. Nunn gets the ball to Adebayo at the left elbow and quickly sets a cross-screen for Robinson. Bradley Beal switches that screen, but is still trailing Robinson as he takes the hand-off from Adebayo. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, Adebayo ranks third with 7.9 elbow touches per game and leads the league with 54 assists off elbow touches. Play 2. Robinson hesitates on the initial sideline hand-off from Adebayo, allowing Malik Beasley to get back in the play. He gets the ball back to Adebayo in the mid-post and sets a cross-screen for Butler, who cuts through. The Wolves switch that screen and Robinson comes back for a hand-off from Adebayo, who flattens Josh Okogie with his screen. Number to know: Adebayo has passed on 54.2% of his post-ups, the highest rate among 29 players who have averaged at least three post-ups per game. Play 3. Adebayo brings the ball up the floor and Robinson sets a pin-down screen for Jones. But Jones then pivots and sets the same screen for Robinson, who gains separation from Lonzo Ball before taking the hand-off from Adebayo. Number to know: The Heat lead the league with 9.6 hand-off possessions per game . Play 4. Collin Sexton is top-locking Robinson on the right wing, so he goes under Olynyk\u2019s screen. He then snakes his way into another hand-off from Adebayo. Number to know: Robinson has an effective field goal percentage of 78.5% in the first quarter , the best mark, by a wide margin, for any player in any quarter (minimum 100 field goal attempts). The next best mark is that of Hassan Whiteside in the fourth quarter ( 73.6% ). Play 5. On the first possession of the third quarter of the Heat\u2019s March 2 win over the Bucks, the league\u2019s best defensive team blows up the designed play and Adebayo is left searching for an outlet. Khris Middleton continues to deny Robinson, so he flares to the corner and hits a tough 3-pointer late in the shot clock. Number to know: Robinson ranks second in the league with 70 corner 3-pointers (10 fewer than Houston\u2019s P.J. Tucker). The 50.4% he\u2019s shot on corner 3-pointers ranks eighth among 108 players with at least 50 attempts. We\u2019ve seen 10 distinct ways for Robinson to get to his shot. As a 45% 3-point shooter who is ready to launch whenever he touches the ball who also has a myriad of ways to get open, Robinson is going to grab the defense\u2019s attention. Watch the Heat enough and you\u2019ll realize how much Robinson affects Miami opponents. Here\u2019s Spencer Dinwiddie with his head turned away from the ball, focused solely on Robinson.  The fear of letting a good shooter get open makes defenders forget other priorities \u2026 and that creates opportunities for the shooter\u2019s teammates. Here are a few examples of the Robinson threat opening up great shots for his teammates: Play 1. Iguodala gets stopped in transition and initially looks to Robinson trailing on the right wing. That gets Wilson Chandler scrambling away from the paint, leaving an open lane for Crowder to follow the play for a dunk. Number to know: According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Heat have scored a league-best 1.19 points per possession in transition. Per Second Spectrum, the Heat have the league\u2019s second-highest effective field goal percentage in the first six seconds of the shot clock (63.7%). Play 2. Here\u2019s that same action as Play 1 in the Adebayo-Robinson video above. Dragic enters to Olynyk at the the right elbow and sets a cross-screen for Robinson. But a fake hand-off from Olynyk (master of fake hand-offs) gets Caris LeVert to jump out toward Robinson. Olynyk attacks the paint, draws help from DeAndre Jordan, and drops the ball off for Iguodala. Number to know: The Heat are the only team that ranks in the top 5 in free throw rate (29.8 attempts per 100 shots from the field, first), but in the bottom 5 in the percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted area (29.5%, 27th). Play 3. Same action again, with Butler passing to Adebayo and setting the pick. Evan Fournier gets between Robinson and Butler\u2019s screen, but gets caught on the other side when Robinson flares back to the weak side. James Ennis (defending Butler) reacts to the flare and Butler has an open lane to the basket. Number to know: Robinson has taken only 8% of his shots in the restricted area and 9% of his shots in the paint. Those are both the lowest rates among 229 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. But the Heat have shot much better in the restricted area with Robinson on the floor (68.8%) than with him off the floor (63.1%). Play 4. After an offensive rebound, Robinson circles from the top of the floor into a hand-off from Adebayo along the left sideline. With Fournier trailing, Nikola Vucevic steps out to prevent the corner 3-pointer. That gets the Magic into a rotation that eventually leaves Nunn open in the opposite corner. Number to know: 20.3% of the Heat\u2019s points, the league\u2019s third lowest rate, have been either fast break points (10.0, sixth lowest rate ) or second chance points (10.2%, fourth lowest). But they\u2019re tied for the league lead with 86 second-chance 3-pointers. Play 5. With the Heat down two and just 1.9 seconds left in regulation, Adebayo sets a pin-down screen for Robinson. Harrison Barnes switches the screen to prevent Robinson from getting open, but that leaves the 6-foot-3 Cory Joseph alone with Adebayo under the basket. Dragic lofts a perfect lob for Adebayo to tie the game. Number to know: Adebayo is one of six players who have shot 70% or better on at least 200 attempts in the restricted area and 45% or better on at least 100 attempts elsewhere in the paint. Great shooters can be great screeners because opponents them don\u2019t want to let them get open. Robinson is a very willing screener, both on set plays and in ad-lib situations. Here are a few examples: Play 1. When Butler gets the ball back from Crowder on the right side of the floor, Robinson is ready with a ball screen. Fultz (defending Robinson) doesn\u2019t stop the ball and Butler gets a step on Aaron Gordon, drawing help from the weak side. That leaves Dragic open in the left corner. Number to know: The Heat rank second in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (39.4%). Play 2. This is the same action (in the same game) as Play 4 in the first video. But after flashing to the ball, Robinson hands it back to Butler, who gets a step on Crowder. Jonas Valanciunas slides over to help and Butler hits Adebayo for a short jump hook. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum, the Heat are one of five teams that rank in the bottom 10 in both ball movement (319 passes per 24 minutes of possession, 21st) and player movement (10.8 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession, 22nd). Play 3. Robinson sets a cross screen for Nunn. Dinwiddie stays attached to Robinson, LeVert trails Nunn into a hand-off from Adebayo and then sinks a comfortable elbow jumper against the Nets\u2019 drop scheme. Number to know: Nunn leads all rookies with 164 mid-range attempts. The 47.6% he\u2019s shot on those ranks 13th among 79 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 4. Later in the same game, Robinson sets a pin-down screen for Nunn out of the right corner. Dinwiddie stays with Robinson again, leaving LeVert to get around both Robinson and Dinwiddie. That makes him late in contesting Nunn\u2019s 3-pointer from the top after a hand-off from Jones. Number to know: Forty-nine players have attempted at least 100 pull-up 3-pointers and at least 100 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. Of those 49, 43 have shot better on the catch-and-shoot attempts. Dragic and Nunn are two of six that have shot better on the pull-up 3-pointers ( 38.5% for Dragic, 38.5% for Nunn ) than on the catch-and-shoot 3-pointers ( 36.3%, 35.5% ). League averages are 33% on pull-up 3-pointers and 37% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. Play 5. Michael Carter-Williams is top-locking Robinson as Olynyk tries to set a screen. Robinson ad-libs a screen for Olynyk, who flares to a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer. Number to know: Among the 190 players with at least 100 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts, Robinson (45.8%), Olynyk (44.7%) and Tyler Herro (45.5%) rank eighth, ninth and 10th in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage, while Crowder (28.6%) and Jones (26.8%) rank 184th and 188th. In the playoffs, Robinson will likely be the target of offenses that look at him as the weak link in Miami\u2019s 14th-ranked defense. But at 6-foot-7, he\u2019s not a major liability on that end of the floor. What he does offensively \u2014 both his shooting and the opportunities it creates for others \u2014 more than makes up for whatever he gives back on defense. This season, the Heat have been 12.3 points per 100 possessions better with Robinson on the floor (+7.7) than with him off the floor (-4.6). That\u2019s the biggest on-off-court NetRtg differential among 218 players who have played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team. It\u2019s rare to see a Miami team that doesn\u2019t rank in the top 10 defensively. But the Heat rank seventh offensively and have had the third-best offense (110.6 points scored per 100 possessions in 24 games) against the league\u2019s top 10 defenses . Robinson is one of two Heat players (Adebayo is the other) who have played in all 24 of those games, averaging 12.7 points on an effective field goal percentage of 66.6%. In his 728 minutes on the floor against the league\u2019s top 10 defenses (seven of which are the other Eastern Conference playoff teams), the Heat have scored 110.6 points per 100 possessions and have outscored their opponents by 96 points. In his 439 minutes off the floor against those 10 teams, the Heat have scored 102.6 points per 100 possessions and have been outscored by 73 points. Going from Division III to the NBA is an incredible story in itself. That Robinson went from playing 161 minutes last season to being an integral part of one of the league\u2019s best offenses this season makes it even more amazing. It\u2019s a testament to his work, the Heat\u2019s player development system and the aggressiveness they\u2019ve instilled in him.

This meeting was part of ongoing discussions between the NBA and the Players Association to address the game\u2019s role in facilitating solutions to the persistent inequities plaguing the Black community. The NBA and NBPA are both committed to fostering an environment that encourages candid conversations between players and league and team leadership and finding tangible and sustainable ways to address racial inequality across the country. The group that met yesterday agreed in principle that the goal of the season restart in Orlando will be to take collective action to combat systemic racism and promote social justice. Conversations also covered strategies to increase Black representation across the NBA and its teams, ensure greater inclusion of Black-owned and operated businesses across NBA business activities, and form an NBA foundation to expand educational and economic development opportunities across the Black community.  While specific plans were not finalized, there was broad alignment about the direction and priorities of the efforts, especially with regard to supporting players\u2019 activism and leadership. In recognition that long-term change can only come from an informed and sustained commitment, conversations regarding these efforts will be ongoing, and additional details will be released at a later date.  \u201cThe issues of systemic racism and police brutality in our country need to end,\u201d said Paul. \u201cAs a union of NBA players and as a league, it is our job to use our collective platform to both put a spotlight on those issues and work to effect change. As players, we have taken a leadership role when it comes to using our voices and implementing practical solutions, but there is much work ahead both in Orlando and long-term to continue the momentum and bring about real, long-lasting change to our society.\u201d \u201cThe league and the players are uniquely positioned to have a direct impact on combating systemic racism in our country, and we are committed to collective action to build a more equal and just society,\u201d said Silver. \u201cA shared goal of our season restart will be to use our platform in Orlando to bring attention to these important issues of social justice.

He told ESPN on Tuesday night that he wants to remain with his wife and three children, including a 6-year-old son with a history of respiratory illnesses. By sitting out, Bradley figures to lose a projected $650,000 in salary. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine making any decision that might put my family\u2019s health and well-being at even the slightest risk,\u201d Bradley told ESPN. \u201cAs promised also, I will use this time away to focus on the formation of projects to help strengthen my communities.\u201d The Lakers are a Western Conference-leading 49-14 and Bradley averaged 8.6 points and 2.3 rebounds per game while starting 44 games before the season was shut down in March due to the coronavirus. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, veteran shooting guard JR Smith is the top candidate to take Bradley\u2019s spot on the roster. https:\/\/twitter.com\/wojespn\/status\/1275623471754682371 Per Wojnarowski, Lakers president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka and Smith\u2019s agent, Rich Paul, were discussing a possible agreement as of Tuesday night and were expected to talk again the following day. Smith hasn\u2019t played in the NBA since 2018 with the Cleveland Cavaliers, when he logged six minutes in a 113-102 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Nov. 19. He worked out for the Lakers in early March as the team was looking to add to its roster, but ultimately opted to sign Dion Waiters to a deal instead of him. Smith teamed with James in Cleveland from 2014-18 and proved, at times, to be a critical piece for the Cavaliers in their run to The Finals each of those seasons. In Game 7 of the 2016 Finals, Smith finished with 12 points on 5-for-13 shooting (2-for-8 on 3-pointers) as Cleveland won the NBA title . Things went down hill for Smith after James left the Cavs to sign with the Lakers before the 2018-19 season. He played in just 11 games that season and stepped away from the team in hopes of being traded or released. He was ultimately waived by the Cavs last summer and has been awaiting a new team since then. Bradley and Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving have been vocal leaders of a players\u2019 coalition that has sought to keep a focus on social justice and racial equality issues. Bradley is the third significant player to decide against reporting to Orlando for a truncated end of the 2019-20 season, followed by the playoffs. Wizards forward Davis Betans reportedly is sitting out rather than risk injury as he becomes a sought-after free agent in the offseason, and the Blazers\u2019 Trevor Ariza reportedly is opting out to take advantage of a one-month visitation with his son as part of a custody case.

Forward Davis Bertans is in the midst of a career-best season but will sit out the restart, reports ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps, in a preventative measure. Bertans is an unrestricted free agent this offseason and is likely in line for a big payday \u2014 either from the Wizards or another team on the market. Per Wojnarowski, the Wizards fully support Bertans\u2019 decision to sit out. The Wizards acquired Bertans last summer in a three-team trade betweeen the San Antonio Spurs, Brooklyn Nets and Washington. He has taken his game to new heights, averaging career highs in scoring (15.4 ppg), 3-pointers made and 3-point percentage (42.4%), rebounds (4.5 rpg) and assists (1.7 apg). His 200 total 3s in 2019-20 rank seventh in the NBA and \u2014 in just 54 games \u2014 put him 23 from tying Bradley Beal\u2019s Wizards franchise record for makes in a season. Bertans is in the second season of a $14.5 million, two-year contract he signed when he was with the Spurs, and based on his $7 million salary this season he would be forfeiting around $600,000 in gross salary for the eight games that he definitely would be missing. If the Wizards were to reach the playoffs, the total lost salary could rise to as much as approximately $900,000, depending on how many games Washington plays. Washington, which is in ninth place in the Eastern Conference, is the only East team outside the current playoff picture invited to the season restart. The returning teams are the 16 teams in current playoff positions and the six teams \u2014 Washington, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix \u2014 that are currently six games or fewer behind the eighth seed in their respective conferences. The Orlando Magic hold the No. 8 spot in the East, whom the Wizards trail by 5 1\/2 games. Each team in the restart is slated to play eight seeding games, which would take place before the 2020 playoffs begin. The games would be selected from a team\u2019s remaining regular-season matchups. The Wizards, according to a rules memo distributed to teams and obtained by the AP, will be allowed to sign a replacement player for Bertans as early as Tuesday. Bertans would be classified as an \u201cexcused player,\u201d which means he forfeits salary but is not subject to any disciplinary action from the league for choosing not to play. The National Basketball Players Association and the NBA have been in agreement for some time that any player who does not feel safe being part of the restart would not have to participate. Star guard John Wall recently declared himself fully recovered after two operations that sidelined him for the past 1 1\/2 years and said he is \u201citching\u201d to get back on the court next season. Wall has not played in an NBA game since December 2018. Surgery for bone spurs in his left heel ended that season; while he was working his way back from that, he tore his left Achilles tendon and needed another operation in 2019. That held Wall out for all of the current season, which was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

If the Raptors return to the NBA Finals, they could be in Florida for nearly four full months. The reigning NBA champions will start training for the season restart later this week at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, making that school their home base until they head north to the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida, around July 7. They landed in Fort Myers on Monday afternoon, then boarded buses for the team hotel. Toronto\u2019s arrival comes as Florida is dealing with a significant spike in positive coronavirus test results over the past week. The Disney complex, about a 2 1\/2-hour drive from the Fort Myers area, is set to play host to both the NBA and MLS next month. And the Orlando Pride withdrew from the upcoming National Women\u2019s Soccer League tournament on Monday after six players and four staff members tested positive for COVID-19. What awaits the Raptors is a different setup than what will be the case for the other 21 NBA teams that will be participating in the restart at Disney. Other teams will be working out at their home facilities, but as the NBA\u2019s lone team from outside the U.S., the Raptors would have had some logistical difficulties in having players gather in Toronto to prepare for the trip to Disney. Under Canadian rules, Raptors players who have been in the U.S. would have had to quarantine for 14 days upon their return to Toronto, so the team decided to hold its pre-camp workouts in the U.S. It\u2019ll all take place with very strict rules to keep players safe, with access to workouts strictly limited to essential team personnel. \u201cIn keeping with NBA and team safety protocols, there will be no group workouts during this phase of return to play, and strict protocols have been designed to ensure this initial level of access will take place in a safe, controlled, and healthy way,\u201d the Raptors said in a team statement. All group workouts and the official start of training camp for the resumed season will occur at Disney. Individual voluntary workouts are resuming this week, and Tuesday is the start of NBA-mandated coronavirus testing for players and essential staff of all 22 of the Disney-bound teams. The Raptors were 46-18 when the season was halted on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. When play resumes July 30, they will hold a three-game lead over Boston in the race for the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. If the Raptors were to make the NBA Finals and if that series went the full seven games, they would be playing in Florida as late as Oct. 13 according to the league\u2019s current proposed plan for the restarted season.

In his first run with the Cavs from 2005-10, he went 272-138 and took Cleveland to The Finals in 2007. His second stint, in 2013-14, saw him go 33-49 before being fired. He was also coach of the Los Angeles Lakers from 2011-13, going 42-29 in 71 games there. As of late May, Thibodeau has been reported as the top candidate for the opening. The Knicks fired coach David Fizdale in December after a 4-18 start. Since then, Miller has served as interim coach. Miller, according to The Athletic, is expected to receive an interview once the search process is officially underway. Atkinson, who agreed to part ways with the Nets on Mar. 7, is reportedly likely to receive an interview as well. Woodson last served as an assistant coach with the LA Clippers from 2014-18. He coached the Knicks from 2011-12 to 2013-14 and led the team to its most successful season in years. The 2012-13 team, under Woodson\u2019s leadership, went 54-28, won the Atlantic Division and reached the Eastern Conference semifinals. That was the Knicks\u2019 only playoff season win since 2000.

Love credited San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan, who has also fought depression, for giving him the strength to come forward. \u201cWhen heroes like Kevin come forward and share their vulnerability, it shines a light on anxiety and depression, and that helps chip away at stigma,\u201d said Michelle Craske, a UCLA professor in psychology, psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences. \u201cI want to thank Kevin for his leadership and his courage to share his personal story with the world.

NFL quarterback Russell Wilson, along with soccer star Megan Rapinoe and WNBA star Sue Bird, hosted the pre-produced show remotely from their respective homes in Seattle. Each wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts to open the show, and touched on the lives of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, all of whom were killed by police.

The annual moratorium will begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Oct. 19 and continue through noon on Oct. 23, the league told teams on Saturday in a memo obtained by The Associated Press. As was the case last season, teams and free agents can begin negotiating six hours before the moratorium \u2014 so 6 p.m. EDT on Oct. 18. It could be a wildly busy few days in October for the NBA. If the schedule for the restarted season at the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida, goes as planned, Game 7 of the NBA Finals could be held on Oct. 13, followed by the draft three days later and then free agency almost immediately following. By setting the draft date, the NBA also firmed up Aug. 17 as the early entry deadline and Oct. 6 as the early entry withdrawal dates. The league also clarified the procedure for teams should any need arise to replace a player who either was excused from participating in the restart, would be protected from playing for health reasons or chose to not play. Starting July 1 and going through the end of the seeding games, expected to be Aug. 14, substitute players can be signed to take the place of someone who falls into those categories. If a player tests positive for coronavirus after the seeding games end, teams would still be allowed to replace them \u2014 but only with someone who has three years or less of NBA service. And if a player \u2014 excluding two-way players \u2014 refuses to participate in games at Disney, he would lose about 1.1% of his salary for every game missed. That would be capped after 14 games, or roughly 15.1% of the player\u2019s contract. Players who are excused or protected from participating would not be subject to lost salary.

The 16-time NBA champions hired Brown this week as the Lakers\u2019 first director of racial equity and action. Brown, an assistant professor of sociology and African American studies at UCLA, will work with the franchise in identifying ways to create change while educating staff on urgent social issues. The Lakers joined most sports organizations last month in issuing strong statements condemning racism and bigotry after the death of George Floyd while in police custody. The Lakers, one of the world\u2019s most visible sports franchises, have decided they can do more to further causes they care about deeply. Brown said she was approached by Lakers chief operating officer Tim Harris, who had reached out to UCLA for guidance.

The day carried particular importance this year, with teams recognizing the day as important enough to declare it a paid holiday for workers \u2014 acknowledging the problems the country is facing today after several weeks of protests demanding the elimination of police brutality and racial inequality. Many pro athletes, black and white, have taken part in those protests. The NBA gave its employees paid time off on Juneteenth for the first time and Commissioner Adam Silver urged league personnel to take the day and think about race relations.

African Americans commemorated the day the following year, celebrating their anniversary of freedom as \u201cJuneteenth,\u201d a portmanteau of the date Granger arrived. Even after the 13th Amendment ended slavery nationwide later that year, Juneteenth remained the focal celebration point, first in Texas, and then throughout the country as African Americans migrated. Today, up to 49 states recognize it in some form. \u201c Juneteenth is a unifying holiday,\u201d Steve Williams, president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, told USA Today recently. \u201cIt is the completion of the celebration of freedom in America.\u201d This year, the NBA is joining the commemoration for the first time, providing all league office employees paid time off to observe the holiday. During a period when the nation\u2019s struggle with racism has inspired a global movement, honoring Juneteenth provides the league an opportunity \u201cto pause, further educate ourselves and reflect on both the history and the current state of race in our country,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wrote in a letter to league employees.

I was taught by my grandparents that it\u2019s the Independence Day for black people.\u201d NBA legend Caron Butler Players and teams throughout the NBA and WNBA will also honor the day in their communities. The Washington Wizards and Washington Mystics, for example, are leading a procession from the National Mall to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. The names of Black people lost to racial violence will be read and Natasha Cloud of the Mystics and Bradley Beal of the Wizards will deliver remarks. The New York Liberty are leading a one-hour virtual conversation about freedom, justice, equality and the power of the African American vote. Layshia Clarendon of the Liberty and Garrett Temple of the Brooklyn Nets will join a panel that examines politics through the lens of popular culture. The NBA has a long history of addressing race and social justice, and all around the country, other companies like NIKE, Lyft, Target, U.S. Bank, JC Penney and Twitter have joined a groundswell of employers that are recognizing Juneteenth as an official holiday. Philadelphia, New York state and even the Commonwealth of Virginia \u2014 which only this year ended a statewide celebration of Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson \u2014 announced Juneteenth will be a paid state holiday. Why now? The recognition comes in the wake of the recent death of George Floyd , a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Coupled with the killings of Breonna Taylor by police, and Ahmaud Arbery by white men who pursued him as he jogged, anger, mass protests and cries of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d erupted across the U.S., spurring companies \u2014 and individuals \u2014 to reevaluate how they address race, racism and discrimination. As the NBA approaches restarting the 2019-20 season , it is bringing attention and sustained action to issues of social justice, including combating systemic racism, expanding educational and economic opportunities across the black community, enacting meaningful police and criminal justice reform and promoting greater civic engagement. On June 3, the league\u2019s black employee resource group, Dream In Color, held a community conversation featuring political commentator and author Van Jones that was attended by more than 1,000 employees. The NBA is also in discussions with the National Basketball Players Association to develop a comprehensive strategy on how the league, teams and players can best address these issues to drive generational change. Meanwhile, dozens of NBA and WNBA players, coaches, legends and team owners have used their platforms to push for justice and an end to police brutality. They have led marches , written op-eds, launched voting rights initiatives and donated their time and money to the cause. \u201c We have a moment in time,\u201d Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers told protestors at a march in Atlanta last month. \u201cPeople are going to look back, our kids are going to look back at this and say, \u2018You were part of that.\u2019 \u2026We got to keep pushing forward.\u201d While protestors continue to march for justice, Juneteenth parades will likely be smaller this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, Butler\u2019s hometown canceled this year\u2019s celebration citing \u201c the circumstances, and the difficulties that were beyond our control ,\u201d according to Racine\u2019s website, which adds the city is looking forward to 2021. So is Butler. At last year\u2019s celebration, he participated in a ribbon-cutting on a new basketball court and held a clinic at the community center where he first played the sport. He\u2019s excited about the gospel performances, displays of black pride and traditions like the Juneteenth Day Queen and King. \u201cJuneteenth has always been a way to recognize our freedom and independence, where we rally around each other and celebrate each other, where we talk about our struggles, but also celebrate our triumphs,\u201d Butler says. This year, he will host a full day of programming on NBA platforms that will educate fans about Juneteenth and amplify the league\u2019s call for justice through multi-generational voices from the black community and across the NBA family. \u201cJuneteenth makes me think about my ancestors,\u201d Butler continued. \u201cI think about my grandmother who worked in the cotton fields of Columbus, Mississippi, who migrated North. I think about the sacrifices that she made, and her ancestors made. It\u2019s been amazing to be part of the celebration for quite some time, now being 40 years old. It\u2019s a special day.\u201d"},{"id":27406,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tyrese-haliburton-great-point-guards-born-made","date":"2020-06-19","title":"Making his point: The rapid rise of Tyrese Haliburton","content":"Iowa State coach Steve Prohm is a man uniquely qualified to opine on point guards. He fittingly dished an assist to answer the question of whether lead guards are born or made. \u201cFlip Saunders had a great line I read one time,\u201d Prohm says. \u201cGreat point guards come from heaven. I believe that. You\u2019ve just got to find them.\u201d Prohm has then, by measure, been luckier than most when it comes to finding them. At Murray State, he coached future NBA players Isaiah Canaan and Cameron Payne and had Jonathan Stark sitting out as a redshirt transfer before taking the Iowa State job. Stark went on to become the 2018 Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. At Iowa State, Prohm inherited Monte Morris, the NCAA\u2019s all-time single season (5.21-1) and career (4.65-1) leader in assist-to-turnover ratio. After Morris left, Nick Weiler-Babb capably handled point for two seasons. Weiler-Babb\u2019s replacement was Tyrese Haliburton, who might just become the best of all Prohm\u2019s point guards. Haliburton\u2019s 2019-20 season was cut short by a broken wrist suffered in early February, but the 6-foot-5 sophomore was already certain of his next move. In March, Haliburton declared for the NBA Draft and relinquished his final two years of eligibility. Draft analysts agree with that decision. Most list Haliburton \u2014 then averaging 15.2 points, 5.9 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 2.5 steals and shooting 41 percent from 3 \u2014 as a high lottery pick. There\u2019s speculation the Warriors, possessors of one of those golden lottery tickets, would love to see what Haliburton could do after being air-dropped into a lineup with the Splash Brothers and Draymond Green. Haliburton\u2019s quick ascension prompted the question of Prohm: Is Haliburton a product of his environment, or was he born to be a point guard? After dropping that Saunders quote, Prohm thought about it for a second, and then amended his answer to 80-percent born, 20-percent made. And then, recalling that Haliburton is a notorious gym rat, he dropped the percentage a bit more: 75-25. \u201cA lot of it\u2019s in the DNA,\u201d Prohm says, before listing Haliburton\u2019s inherent qualifications to play the point: \u201cUnselfish. In his heart, Tyrese is a giver. Feel for the game. Ability to make people better. Charismatic. Personable \u2026 He\u2019ll be the governor of Wisconsin [Haliburton\u2019s home state] when it\u2019s over. He can own any room.\u201d And then there\u2019s Haliburton\u2019s work ethic, which comes from his parents, John and Brenda. John, a huge Lakers fan when Magic Johnson and the Celtics\u2019 Larry Bird ruled the NBA, insisted his son watch all the game tapes of Johnson he could. Tyrese did as he was told. It was no surprise that when he grew to love the NBA as much as his father, he gravitated to another player in the Magic\/Bird mold, a convention-defying, position-less playmaker who could make his teammates better and defined an era\u2014LeBron James \u201cLeBron was my favorite player growing up,\u201d Haliburton says. \u201cWatching Magic, and then LeBron, I learned a lot. Video games helped, too. I\u2019d play video games and then go outside and play ball in the driveway. Studying those two helped get my basketball IQ where it is.\u201d Haliburton has always gotten the most joy from the game by helping his teammates score, especially those on the end of the bench who seldom played. Hard work is also a Halliburton hallmark. Once again, a tip from his father was an important building block. Iowa State assistant coach Daniyal Robinson remembered Haliburton saying his father had told him, \u2018Once you get to Iowa State, find the best player, and do what he does.\u2019\u201d \u201c[At the time,] Marial Shayok [currently on a two-way contract with the 76ers] was a fifth-year senior and our hardest worker. This guy was a machine in terms of his workout regimen. He worked out pretty much three times a day to go along with whatever we were doing. After a couple of weeks, you see Haliburton working out with Shayok, shooting, doing extra ball-handling work, staying after practice. That happened the rest of the summer, and you saw the growth in Tyrese. \u201cHe was going to be the backup point guard and one of the first guys coming off the bench. We felt good about that. Then when Lindell Wigginton got hurt the second game of the year, we threw Tyrese in there, and there was no turning back. He had a bigger impact on the games than we ever thought he could.\u201d  Haliburton started 34 games his first season, averaging 6.8 points, 3.4 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.5 steals. He also shot .434 from 3, outstanding for anyone, let alone a freshman. In the footsteps of Monte Morris, Haliburton fashioned a 4.5-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, second in the nation and fourth-best in school history. With Weiler-Babb around, Haliburton wasn\u2019t asked to play the point, but he learned Prohm\u2019s system and quickly excelled. Ample evidence of that came in an early December 2018 blowout of Southern during which Haliburton handed out 17 assists, breaking a school record that had stood for 44 years. \u201cHe\u2019s just got something about him,\u201d Prohm said after that game. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s all about. He just wants to win. Some guys have got it, and he\u2019s got it.\u201d There\u2019s another important factor in Haliburton\u2019s rapid development \u2014 Prohm\u2019s system. Prohm and his staff keep recruiting great point guards because at Iowa State, the man who plays that position has certain rights and privileges. \u201cThe system opens up the floor for them,\u201d Prohm says. \u201cWe put a lot of confidence in that position and allow the point guard to make plays that make people better. Everybody steals stuff. We try to steal from the NBA. The floor\u2019s spaced and open, which can help our guys.\u201d Typical of Haliburton, he didn\u2019t rest on his freshman year laurels. Few players in the country had as productive a summer of 2019 as Haliburton. He started by helping the USA Basketball U-19 team win the World Cup, played in Greece. The coach was Kansas State\u2019s Bruce Weber, who had gotten a front-row seat to Haliburton\u2019s point guard skills during the 2018-19 season. In two games against Weber\u2019s Wildcats, Haliburton averaged 5.5 assists. \u201cCoach Weber knew what he was doing when he brought me along,\u201d Haliburton says. \u201cHe contacted coach Prohm and made sure I would be at the tryouts. I can\u2019t thank coach Weber enough. He had a lot of confidence in me just like Coach P did. He told me from the jump to play loose, enjoy what I was doing, keep learning. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am without that USA experience.\u201d Asked about Haliburton at the Big 12 Media Day last fall, Weber was effusive in his praise. \u201cI loved him,\u201d Weber told the media. \u201cThe thing that surprised me was his athleticism. He did some things I never thought he could do. Obviously, we knew he could shoot. He\u2019s a great young man. He was a great leader.\u201d Haliburton earned a spot on the tournament\u2019s All-Star Five team after averaging a tournament-high 6.9 assists, shooting 68.9% from the field and draining 10-of-18 3-pointers. Less than a month after returning home, Haliburton was off to California for the Nike Skills Academy, where his confidence, already lifted by his USA Basketball accomplishments, multiplied times 10. \u201cThat was big for me, to know that I belonged,\u201d says Haliburton, who had been rated a three-star recruit out of Oshkosh North High School in Wisconsin. \u201cI performed well with other guys who had been hyped up for the majority of their lives. It was big time.\u201d No sooner did Haliburton return to Iowa, he was on a plane with his teammates, headed for a playing tour of Italy, The Cyclones won all three of their games, and Haliburton averaged 6.6 assists. \u201cAnother great experience,\u201d Haliburton says. \u201cI racked up some miles last summer.\u201d All that preparation paid off for Haliburton, who was a serious contender for the Bob Cousy Award, given to the nation\u2019s top point guard, before he was injured in a game against Kansas State. \u201cHe tried to block a shot,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cHe went down on the same wrist that had been bothering him all year. So he goes in the training room at halftime and says, \u2018I\u2019m OK. I\u2019m playing.\u2019 He came back and played seven minutes in the second half. He\u2019s a tough kid. Physically and mentally.\u201d Haliburton was disappointed when he found out he was done for the season, but not for himself. He would have done anything to help the Cyclones \u2014 who ultimately finished an uncharacteristic 12-20 \u2014 win more games. The injury did nothing to dissuade Haliburton from finalizing the most important decision of his basketball career. He deemed himself ready for the NBA, and there were no dissenting opinions from the ISU coaching staff. \u201cYou talk to a lot of NBA people, and they\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s a lot more to the really great players than performing on game night,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of preparation that goes into it. That won\u2019t set back Tyrese. He\u2019ll be able to hit the ground running when it comes to preparation. He\u2019s like a sponge. He soaks up information, and he\u2019s not intimidated by guys being older or having more experience.\u201d Prohm says Haliburton will be \u201cblessed wherever he ends up,\u201d but he\u2019s got a spot in mind. \u201cMy son is 5, and he\u2019s just starting to fall in love with basketball,\u201d Prohm says. \u201cHe asks me all the time, \u2018where will Tyrese end up? I hope he ends up with Golden State or San Antonio.\u2019 \u201d \u201cHe\u2019d be great [for the Warriors]. He\u2019s a ball mover, and he can play the 1, 2 or 3 at the next level. And he\u2019s all about winning, all about doing the right things, a lot of the things I\u2019ve read about what the Warriors do as a team.\u201d Haliburton has spent the offseason in Milwaukee, working with a strength coach and his former AAU coach Bryan Johnikin. He talks often to Shayok and other former ISU players in the NBA, like Georges Niang. He knows what to expect, and he\u2019s ready to meet the challenge. His meteoric rise, from underappreciated and under-recruited high school recruit to a potential lottery pick, hasn\u2019t fazed him. Haliburton is just following the script\u2014the 75 percent Prohm described\u2014and adding 25 percent of sweat equity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say if you asked me when I was 18, I would have thought I\u2019d be where I am now,\u201d Haliburton says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s a surprise to me now, just because I\u2019ve worked really, really hard. It\u2019s kind of the fruits of my labor at this point. I went about things the right way and prepared to get to where I am.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

The Pistons announced on Thursday they have have hired Troy Weaver to become the team\u2019s new GM. Weaver had served as vice president and assistant GM for the Thunder since 2008. He was promoted to VP of basketball operations before the 2017-18 season. \u201cTroy is an outstanding executive with an exceptional track record for identifying and developing talent,\u201d said Pistons owner Tom Gores said in a statement. \u201cIn talking with Troy, he\u2019s got both the skill and temperament to lead, and the confidence and creativity to work collaboratively with others.

Troy comes aboard to help take us to the next level.\u201d Before that, Weaver was player personnel director for the Utah Jazz in 2007-08 before spending three seasons (2004-07) as the Jazz\u2019s head scout. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Weaver is the fourth OKC executive under Sam Presti to leave for a GM job, a list that includes Rich Cho, Rob Hennigan and Michael Winger. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for me to join a franchise with the history and tradition of the Detroit Pistons,\u201d Weaver said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the challenge of building this team into a consistent winner and assembling the pieces to compete at a very high level. We\u2019ll get to work right away, evaluating opportunities and installing systems that will make us all successful.\u201d Stefanski, a senior advisor to Gores, has been running basketball operations for the Pistons and will remain as the team\u2019s top basketball executive. The GM spot for the Pistons has been vacant since the team overhauled its front office two years ago. Stan Van Gundy had been the team\u2019s coach and team president, with Jeff Bower serving as GM. After the Pistons moved on from Van Gundy in 2018, Stefanski took over the front office and Dwane Casey became the coach.

The order Wednesday shifts the focus to a separate but related case between the same litigants in federal court in North Carolina. The Florida lawsuit, filed last summer by Prime Sports Marketing and company president Gina Ford, accused Williamson and the agency now representing him of breach of contract and seeks $100 million in damages. That came after Williamson had filed his own lawsuit a week earlier in North Carolina to terminate a five-year contract with Prime Sports after his decision to move to Creative Artists Agency. Ford\u2019s attorneys had submitted questions in filings last month that included whether the Williamson or anyone on his behalf sought or accepted \u201cmoney, benefits, favors or things of value\u201d to sign with Duke. They sought answers within 30 days to establish facts under oath in the pretrial discovery process. Attorneys for last year\u2019s No. 1 overall NBA draft pick had argued the questions were \u201cnothing more than a fishing expedition.\u201d Florida circuit judge David C. Miller denied Williamson\u2019s original stay request, but that was overturned on a temporary basis by the state appeals court, which has now made that ruling permanent, siding with Williamson attorney Jeffrey S. Klein that the federal case takes precedence. In a filing last week in the North Carolina case, Prime Sports-Ford attorneys continued to argue that last summer\u2019s No. 1 overall NBA draft pick didn\u2019t meet the definition of a student-athlete because he was \u201cineligible\u201d to play college sports. That filing referenced housing for Williamson\u2019s family during his time with the Blue Devils as well as three luxury SUVs registered by his mother and stepfather between December 2017 and April 2019 \u2014 the latter being the same month Williamson announced he would go pro before ultimately being picked by the New Orleans Pelicans. The argument about Williamson\u2019s eligibility is center of the legal fight over Williamson\u2019s endorsement potential. Williamson\u2019s lawsuit stated that Prime Sports violated the state\u2019s sports agent law, both by failing to include disclaimers about the loss of eligibility when signing the contract and the fact neither Prime Sports nor Ford were registered as agent in North Carolina. Attorneys for Prime Sports and Ford argue the Uniform Athlete Agents Act wouldn\u2019t apply if Williamson was ineligible to play college basketball from the start. Duke has repeatedly declined to comment on the case because it isn\u2019t involved in the litigation, but issued a statement in January that school had reviewed Williamson\u2019s eligibility previously and found no concerns."},{"id":27364,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-kelly-oubre-jr-out-season-restart","date":"2020-06-18","title":"Report: Kelly Oubre Jr. (torn meniscus) out for season restart","content":" The Phoenix Suns are preparing for the NBA season restart in Orlando, Florida, but a report indicates they\u2019ll be without swingman Kelly Oubre Jr. once game action resumes.

NBA players, coaches and others have taken part in that outcry in the past few weeks. Per a report from ESPN on Tuesday, Los Angeles Lakers guard Avery Bradley and Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving say their players coalition is eager to hear the NBA\u2019s plan on issues of importance to the black community before the NBA\u2019s restart in Orlando on July 30. In a seeming response to Tuesday\u2019s news, the National Basketball Players Association issued a release Wednesday detailing how the players\u2019 union has challenged \u201clong-ignored injustices resulting from systemic racism in general and police misconduct in particular.\u201d \u201cWe are actively preparing and soliciting proposals regarding ways Players competing in the games in Orlando can effectively continue their advocacy on the national stage occasioned by the games,\u201d the NBPA said in its release. Additionally, the NBPA said it continues to be in discussion with the NBA and its teams regarding actions players are urging to be taken along with \u201cprospective joint social justice engagements.\u201d The NBPA said in its release it will continue to match players\u2019 philanthropic contributions to organizations focused on ending police brutality such as Legal Defense Fund, Chicago Votes, Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defenders, National Museum of African American History and Culture and more. \u201cThe NBPA will deepen its commitment to social justice by increasing our support for similar organizations that are focused on ending police brutality, addressing voter suppression and supporting economic development,\u201d the release said. In addition, the NBPA hopes to be at the forefront of creating the Police Accountability Project. The PAP will create and manage a nationwide database of police misconduct and abuse instances as well as help support community efforts to remove local officials in jurisdictions that show \u201chistorical indifference to or affirmative protection of predatory police officers.\u201d Increasing voter registration and turnout among union members is also a key initiative for the NBPA. Per the union, registered players were on nine teams before the 2019-20 season began. The NBPA said it will look to ramp up its policy and ballot education during the season restart in Orlando. The NBPA, per its release, said 65% of its members are of color and 40% are women and that diversity has always been important to the union. Bradley, per ESPN, voiced concern about improved hiring practices for black front-office and coaching candidates. He also urged for organizations to serve black communities as well as form partnerships with black-owned businesses. The NBPA, in its release, seemed to agree with that point as well. \u201cThe vast majority of our members are black. As we strive to identify our role in addressing issues of systemic racism that go beyond police brutality, we believe we are uniquely positioned to engage our partners in constructive dialog about their workforce and board diversity. We believe they should also recognize the value of black participation at every level of their organization.\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said discussions of such concerns with the NBPA have been ongoing. He said Monday any player who did not feel comfortable participating in Orlando would not breach their contract. But he suggested the multiple agendas could be served with the game\u2019s return. Irving and Bradley are two players who have taken on expanded roles in organizing player conference calls over the past week. The league currently has eight black general managers and seven black coaches."},{"id":27418,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/schuhmann-film-study-utah-jazz","date":"2020-06-17","title":"Film Study: How Utah creates offense with drives to the rim","content":" The Utah Jazz ranking higher on offense than they do on defense for the first time since Rudy Gobert\u2019s rookie season is one of the many surprises from this wild 2019-20 campaign. The Jazz were 11th in defensive efficiency when the league suspended play in March, after ranking in the top three in each of the last three seasons. But this defensive fall-off was made up for with improved offense and more success in close games (a byproduct of the improved offense). The Jazz rank in the top 10 for offensive efficiency and have been the league\u2019s best jump-shooting team, ranking first in effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (54.7%) and tied for first in 3-point percentage (38.3). Utah led the league in ball movement during coach Quin Snyder\u2019s first season with the team. Since then, they haven\u2019t moved the ball as much. This season, they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s biggest drop in assist percentage, recording assists on just 55.2% of their buckets ( 26th ), down from from 64.4% ( fourth ) last season. Former Jazz guard Ricky Rubio\u2019s new team has seen the biggest jump. However, ball movement doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to efficiency, as was noted in regard to the Boston Celtics\u2019 fifth-ranked offense . In fact, it may be better to be better off the dribble than off the catch. Like the Celtics, the Jazz are in the bottom three in the percentage of their jump shots that have been catch-and-shoot jumpers , according to Second Spectrum tracking. The difference comes in drives per game , where the Jazz lead the league for the third straight season and Boston is in the bottom half of the league. Utah\u2019s 57.4 drives per game this season are the most for any team in the seven years of player tracking. The Jazz have six of the 65 players who have averaged at least eight drives per game. Only seven of the other 29 teams have more than two, and the Celtics (four) are the only other team with more than three. Utah also ranks seventh in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (50.5%) and eighth in free throw rate (26.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field). While the Jazz are in the bottom five in regard to both assist percentage and the percentage of their jumpers that have come off the catch, they do lead the league in both catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (41.3%) and 3-point percentage on open or wide-open 3-pointers (39.7%), according to Second Spectrum. The Utah offense, with Gobert having a critical role as a high-volume screen-setter and efficient finisher, is about getting into the paint and going from there. One Jazz possession could feature three or four guys attacking off the dribble. And they all have their strengths. Let\u2019s break down how five Jazz players get it done. Donovan Mitchell leads the Jazz and ranks 13th in the league with 15.5 drives per game. The third-year guard won the dunk contest as a rookie, but his drives don\u2019t always get him to the hoop. Only 45% of Mitchell\u2019s shots in the paint have come in the restricted area. That\u2019s the sixth-lowest rate among 161 players with at least 200 total shots in the paint and that matters because there\u2019s a big difference between shots in the restricted area (made 63% of the time league-wide) and shots elsewhere in the paint (40%). Mitchell has also passed on only 29.1% of his drives, the third-lowest rate among the 65 players who\u2019ve averaged at least eight drives per game. So defenses can feel somewhat comfortable committing to his attacks. They might not feel so comfortable trying to figure out how Mitchell is going to loft the ball toward the basket. He can sometimes get too cute or paint himself into a corner with his attempts to finish, but he\u2019s certainly creative in finding holes in the defense. Play 1. One a sideline out-of-bounds play, the Jazz run a \u201cstack\u201d or \u201cSpain\u201d pick-and-roll, with Gobert setting a high screen for Mitchell and Joe Ingles setting a back-screen on Gobert\u2019s defender (Kristaps Porzingis). This leaves Seth Curry (originally guarding Ingles) in between Mitchell and the basket as he goes downhill. A Eurostep gets Mitchell to the other side of the basket for a reverse. Number to know: Mitchell ranks fourth with 11.7 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game , according to Synergy play-type tracking. The 0.94 points per possession he\u2019s scored on those ranks 18th among 49 players who have averaged at least five pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game. Play 2. With the Rockets switching screens, Mitchell gets isolated against James Harden. He beats Harden to the right, but goes back to his left hand for the finish. Number to know: The Jazz rank 17th with just 6.2 isolation possessions per game and nobody in the top 35 among individuals . Play 3. When Ingles slips out of a screen for Mitchell, he starts to split the defenders. But then he uses a wicked in-and-out dribble to put both of them in his rearview mirror and get to the rim. Number to know: Mitchell\u2019s 61.1% in the restricted area is up from 59.0% last season, but down from his mark of 61.7% as a rookie. It ranks 60th among 89 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. Play 4. Mitchell dances around a few screens from Tony Bradley to get past Jayson Tatum. With Enes Kanter in drop coverage, he finds space for a short pull-up jumper. Number to know: Mitchell leads the league with 5.2 non-restricted-area paint attempts per game . His 43.6% on those shots ranks 33rd among 95 players who have attempted at least 100 total. Play 5. In transition, Mitchell doesn\u2019t quite get around Svi Mykhailiuk with a Eurostep, but still connects on a wrong-footed hook shot of sorts. Number to know: Mitchell has scored just 0.89 points per possession in transition, the third worst mark among 101 players who have averaged at least two transition possessions per game. There are those who drive to score, and those who drive to pass. Joe Ingles has recorded assists on 15.7% of his drives, the second-highest rate among the 65 players who\u2019ve averaged at least eight drives per game. Play 1. Ingles comes out of the right corner to take a hand-off from Gobert (an oft-seen action in the Utah offense) and gets a step on Luka Doncic. With Maxi Kleber protecting the rim and Curry tagging Gobert\u2019s roll to the rim, Jordan Clarkson is open in the corner where Ingles started. Ingles\u2019 blind pass is accurate enough. Number to know: The Jazz rank second with 4.1 corner 3-pointers per game. 28.4% of their 3-point attempts, the league\u2019s second highest rate, have come from the corners. Play 2. Ingles\u2019 initial foray into the paint doesn\u2019t produce much, but he gains an advantage when he relocates, attack\u2019s Curry\u2019s close-out, and circles around another screen from Gobert. Curry holds up Gobert\u2019s roll to the rim, but Ingles has just enough hang time to wait out the big man. Number to know:  Ingles\u2019 87 assists to Gobert are tied for 19th most from one player to a single teammate. Play 3. Another secondary-action screen from Gobert gets Ingles going downhill against the drop coverage of Bam Adebayo, who gets fooled by Ingles\u2019 delayed drop-off to the rolling Gobert. Number to know: Gobert\u2019s effective field goal percentage of 69.8% and true shooting percentage of 70.0% are both the highest marks among 137 players with at least 500 field goal attempts. Play 4. Ingles comes out of the right corner again, this time to take a hand-off from Mitchell. He gets another screen from Gobert, gets into the paint and then passes Mitchell into a corner three behind the recovering Cam Johnson. Number to know: Ingles has recorded assists on 33.5% of his possessions, the seventh highest rate among 265 players who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 40 games or more. Play 5. When they\u2019re expecting you to pass, you can get \u2019em with a simple fake. Kleber is the victim here. Number to know  : 48.2% of Ingles\u2019 buckets have been unassisted. That\u2019s the highest rate of his career by a wide margin. While Ingles\u2019 drives are more methodical, Mike Conley is still using his quickness at the age of 32. Conley struggled in his first two months with his new team, and Utah really took off offensively while he was injured . But he saw improvement upon moving back into the starting lineup in February, averaging 16.5 points on an effective field goal percentage of 56.5% over his last 13 games. Play 1. The Blazers switch a transition hand-off from Ingles to Conley, who catches Damian Lillard with his feet out of position and drives by. Number to know: Only 39% of Conley\u2019s shots in the paint have come in the restricted area. That\u2019s the fourth lowest rate among 161 players with at least 200 total shots in the paint Play 2. On the first play of the Jazz\u2019s March 6 win in Boston (one of Conley\u2019s best games of the season), the Celtics switch a hand-off from Conley to Bojan Bogdanovic, who gets the ball back to Conley on the left wing. He quickly attacks Tatum baseline and draws help from the weak side. That results in an open corner 3 for Mitchell. Number to know: The Jazz have outscored their opponents by 6.3 points per game, the league\u2019s third best differential, from 3-point range. Play 3. A very similar play three days later (Conley likes to attack baseline from that spot on the left wing) results in another open 3-pointer from the same corner, this one from Conley, who relocates (Stephen Curry style) after Ingles passes on the initial open look. Number to know: Conley has averaged 13.8 ppg, down from 21.1 last season . That\u2019s the second biggest drop among 234 players who have played at least 40 games each of the last two seasons. He\u2019s also seen the fifth biggest drop in assists per game (from 6.4 to 4.3 per game). Play 4. Another switch on a hand-off has Chris Boucher trying to guard Conley at the top of the floor. A hesitation move puts Boucher in the dust, collapses the Toronto defense and gets Clarkson open in that same right corner. Number to know: Conley\u2019s assist-turnover ratio of 2.34 is the lowest mark of his career and down from 3.45 (the second highest mark of his career) last season. Play 5. With the Jazz taking the ball out of bounds on the sideline, the Raptors are in zone. A clever pair of screens from Clarkson and Ingles opens a path for Conley down the middle of the paint. His drive draws help from Serge Ibaka and he finds Tony Bradley on the baseline. Number to know: According to Synergy, the Jazz have faced 137 total possessions of zone, 18th most in the league. The 1.08 points per possession they\u2019ve scored against zone ranks fifth among the 22 teams who have faced at least 100 possessions of zone defense. Mitchell might not be the most crafty finisher on his own team. Jordan Clarkson has a reputation for being a less-than-willing passer, but that shouldn\u2019t overshadow just how crafty a scorer he is. Every team needs guys who can get buckets, and Clarkson has been able to do so relatively efficiently since coming to the Jazz in late December. Since his arrival, Clarkson has been the Jazz\u2019s third leading scorer at 15.6 points (in just 25.3 minutes) per game. His effective field goal percentage (55.1%) and true shooting percentage (58.3%) this season are both career-high marks , and have both been higher in Utah than they were in Cleveland. Clarkson is just 6-foot-4 and 194 pounds, but he\u2019s not afraid of attacking bigs in the paint. He can score around those bigs from a myriad of angles. Play 1. Clarkson takes a circular route to a sideline pick-and-roll with Bradley. He crosses over to his left hand, gets into the paint, and bumps Porzingis under the basket. He then spins back to his right hand, takes some contact, and finishes over the 7-foot-3 Latvian. Number to know: With the Jazz, Clarkson has scored 1.07 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, up from 0.95 with Cleveland . Play 2. A transition cross-match gets Clarkson iso\u2019d against Dario Saric. He initially drives left before spinning back to the right. Saric is able to cut him off, but not quick enough to recover back to one more change of direction. Number to know: Clarkson has passed on just 28.2% of his drives (a lower rate than Mitchell) in his 34 games with the Jazz, down from 44.9% in his 29 games with Cleveland. Play 3. When Gordon Hayward \u201cices\u201d a screen from Gobert, Clarkson goes baseline and draws Daniel Theis into another isolation. He goes baseline again, gets Theis on his heels with a little nudge, and finishes strong. Number to know: The Jazz have seen the league\u2019s third biggest drop in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area, from 35.9% (seventh) last season to 30.6% (20th) this season. Play 4. After an offensive rebound, Clarkson attacks just as Delon Wright is recovering out to the perimeter. Justin Jackson is there to help on the baseline, but Clarkson squeezes between the two defenders and finishes on the other side of the rim. Number to know: The Jazz have outscored their opponents by 14.8 points per 100 possessions in 421 minutes with Clarkson and Ingles on the floor together. That\u2019s the best on-court mark (by a healthy margin) among 33 Jazz combinations that have played at least 300 minutes. Play 5. Clarkson gets another defender \u2013 Danuel House \u2013 on his heels, finishing him off with one of his five dunks in 34 games with the Jazz. Number to know: Clarkson has shot 67.4% in the restricted area , the best mark of his career. After shooting 62.8% in the restricted area with the Cavs, he\u2019s shot 71.4% there with the Jazz. If the season resumes in Orlando next month, the Jazz will be without Bogdanovic , the team\u2019s second-leading scorer and the biggest reason they\u2019ve taken such a step forward offensively. It\u2019s the shooting numbers that stand out for Bogdanovic. He leads the league with 111 wide-open 3-pointers , and the 50.5% he\u2019s shot on wide-open 3s is the third best mark among 128 players who have attempted at least 100. He\u2019s tied for third with 133 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, 57 more than any of his teammates have made. Bogdanovic\u2019s absence will create more minutes for some combination of Conley, O\u2019Neale, Clarkson and Georges Niang, who have combined to shoot 41.1% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers this season (including Clarkson\u2019s time in Cleveland). That\u2019s much better than the league average (37%) and not far off Bogdanovic\u2019s 42.6%. But Bogdanovic offers more offensively than just his ability to shoot off the catch. Catch-and-shoot opportunities account for just 6.4 (31%) of his 20.2 ppg. Catch-and-shoot points account for 64% and 59% of Niang\u2019s and O\u2019Neale\u2019s total scoring, respectively. Those are the sixth and 12th highest rates among 264 players that have scored at least 300 total points this season, according to Second Spectrum. He\u2019s not a prolific passer. Bogdanovic has recorded assists on just 9.8% of his possessions, the second-lowest mark among 40 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. But he can be used in a lot of ways, he can create shots for himself when a possession has broken down, and he can take advantage of mismatches, either against lumbering bigs or small guards. Play 1. In an after-timeout play, Bogdanovic sets a ball screen and then curls off a Gobert pin-down, drawing a foul on a drive to the hoop. Number to know: Bogdanovic ranks fourth in free throw percentage (90.3%) and his free throw rate (29.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is the highest of his career. Play 2. Bogdanovic again starts as a screener, but when the initial action doesn\u2019t produce an advantage, he\u2019s a secondary pick-and-roll ball-handler. He gets Curry on his hip and drops in a short floater over Porzingis. Number to know: Gobert ranks second with 7.0 screen assists per game. Play 3. After Duncan Robinson pinches toward Ingles with the ball, Bogdanovic is able to attack the seam in the Miami defense and finish with his left hand. Number to know: Bogdanovic has scored 0.456 points per touch, second most among 294 players with at least 1,000 touches, according to Second Spectrum. Play 4. Another Gobert screen gets Hassan Whiteside switched onto Bogdanovic, who\u2019s able to beat the seven-footer off the dribble. Number to know: Bogdanovic and Gobert have played 1,911 minutes together, most among any pair of teammates this season. Play 5. This time, a switch has Bogdanovic being guarded by the 6-2 Monte Morris, who can\u2019t handle Bogdanovic in the low post. Number to know: Bogdanovic has scored 1.09 points per possession on post-ups, the second best mark among 58 players with at least 50 post-up possessions, according to Synergy. Offensive improvement, along with the league\u2019s biggest increase in clutch winning percentage, had the Jazz in position to have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2001. Alas, should the season resume next month, there will be no home-court advantage and the Jazz. They\u2019ll also be without Bogdanovic, who had season-ending right wrist surgery in May.  Of course, the restart could feel like an entirely new season, one where anything can happen. Better shooting from Mitchell and Conley could help make up for the absence of Bogdanovic. And with Gobert in the middle, Utah can still have one of the best defenses in Orlando. It seems like the Jazz are in a tough spot in regard to advancing to the conference semifinals for a third time in the last four seasons. But we can be sure that the Jazz will attack the paint and go from there. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Spain\u2019s main league, considered one of the world\u2019s best outside of the NBA, will resume Wednesday with the launch of a 12-team tournament playing in a single venue in the eastern city of Valencia. There will be 33 matches played without fans in a two-week span. Germany resumed its league two weeks ago using a similar enclosed format in Munich, and the NBA is set to follow suit in late July with 22 teams playing at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida. The 18-team Euroleague canceled its season in May as the pandemic prompted border restrictions in most European countries. \u201cTwo months ago, it seemed crazy just to think about playing again,\u201d Spanish league president Antonio Mart\u00edn said. \u201cMany people put in a lot of work and a lot of effort to make this happen. If it hadn\u2019t been for this joint effort, nothing would have been possible. This is already a victory that deserves celebration.\u201d There will be tight health safety measures in place in Valencia with players and team members being constantly monitored. The nearly 600 people involved are assigned to one of four hotels. The training facilities and hotels are located within about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) of each other, with everyone confined to that area. The top 12 clubs in the standings when the league was suspended in mid-March have been divided into two groups of six for the final phase. Barcelona heads one group, and Real Madrid the other. The top two from each group advance. The single-match final is scheduled for June 30. \u201cEverything is new for everyone,\u201d Baskonia coach Dusko Ivanovic said. \u201cIt could be a more interesting tournament, similar to a playoff. You can win the title in seven games.\u201d Defending champion Real Madrid was one of the teams directly affected by the pandemic when American forward Trey Thompkins tested positive for the coronavirus after a match played in Milan. The positive result in March prompted Madrid\u2019s basketball and soccer teams to enter quarantine because they shared some facilities at the club\u2019s training center. \u201cWe are in this bubble to avoid the risk of infections,\u201d Real Madrid point guard Sergio Llull said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, and mentally it requires a big effort, but we\u2019re going to do it so that everything goes well and people can enjoy basketball again from their homes.\u201d The Spanish basketball league said the games in this final tournament will be broadcast in 125 countries, including the United States. The Spanish soccer league resumed without fans last week with matches played across the country."},{"id":27363,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-schea-cotton","date":"2020-06-17","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Schea Cotton","content":"Former hoops phenom Schea Cotton joins Sekou Smith on the latest edition of the Hang Time podcast.

The NBA hopes that doesn\u2019t matter. After spending weeks on putting together an incredibly elaborate series of health and safety protocols \u2014 the word \u201ctesting\u201d appears 282 times in the document \u2014 the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association believe they have done what is necessary to keep the 22 teams and others who will be part of the season restart at the Disney campus near Orlando next month safe and healthy. Ready or not, basketball is almost back. \u201cNo one is suggesting that this is going to be an infection-free, guaranteed environment,\u201d NBPA executive director Michele Roberts told The Associated Press. \u201cI guess, unless we go to \u2026 well, where would we go? What state has the lowest rate? There\u2019s just no way of finding a sterile environment probably on this planet, but certainly, not in this country.\u201d Among the details that were included in the protocols released to teams Tuesday night : players will be invited to wear what the league calls a \u201cproximity alarm\u201d that will set off an audio alert when the person is within six feet of another person for more than five seconds and therefore not following social distancing guidelines, plus they can choose to wear a ring that will generate \u201ca wellness assessment derived from metrics such as body temperature and respiratory and heart rate.\u201d Players and staff will also be given thermometers and a pulse oximeter so they can track their data and record it on the league\u2019s daily health platform. \u201cI am optimistic about the NBA\u2019s return to play policies and procedures,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone, who found out last month that he had already beaten COVID-19 after an antibody test showed he had the virus. \u201cThey are going to do whatever it takes to make this the safest environment as possible. There are no guarantees and there will be a risk, but I feel confident in the measures to be taken pre-Orlando and once in Orlando.\u201d True, there will be a risk. And the league acknowledges that no plan can be perfect. \u201cThese Protocols are designed to promote prevention and mitigation strategies to reduce exposure to, and transmission of, the coronavirus,\u201d the league said. \u201cHowever, it is possible that staff, players, or other participants in the resumption of the 2019-20 season nonetheless may test positive or contract the coronavirus.\u201d But by following strict rules \u2014 including regular testing, no leaving the Disney campus without returning to quarantine, no unauthorized guests, no family members even being permitted to arrive until late August and, though this didn\u2019t likely have to be said, no spitting on the court \u2014 the NBA and the NBPA hope the risk is minimal as teams prepare for a Disney stay that could exceed three months for the teams that make The Finals. \u201cIt\u2019ll still probably bother everybody that we\u2019re not home,\u201d Miami center Bam Adebayo said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019ll be happy to play basketball.\u201d The NBA\u2019s arrival at Disney is looming as the rate of positive tests around the state are rising, and officials such as Gov. Ron DeSantis are facing criticism for re-opening many parts of the state\u2019s economy. But if NBA players aren\u2019t venturing out among the public, the hope is that no matter what\u2019s going on beyond Disney\u2019s fences that the quasi-bubble for basketball won\u2019t be affected. The rate of positive tests in the Orlando area in the seven-day period ending Monday was nearly 6%. For the seven days immediately preceding that, it was 2.4% \u2014 meaning the rate has more than doubled in a one-week span. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning but not surprising,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this governor behave as if the virus is an inconvenience as opposed to a virus. So, I guess watching the way the state is adhering or not adhering to CDC guidelines, it\u2019s not surprising that these numbers would go up.\u201d DeSantis has said Florida\u2019s rising numbers reflects more testing and other factors, though the percentage of positive tests is also significantly higher than was the case just a couple weeks ago across the state and in the Orlando area. The state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, Nikki Fried, tweeted Tuesday that DeSantis \u201chas lost control\u201d of Florida\u2019s response to the pandemic and recklessly re-opened the state \u201cdespite the data screaming for caution.\u201d DeSantis is a Republican; Fried is the only elected Democrat to currently hold a statewide office. \u201cMy solace is that our guys are not going to be out and about in the city of Orlando,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe players will be flown in non-commercial, and they will essentially be on campus for the entirety of their stay until such time as their season ends.\u201d"},{"id":27380,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bryan-colangelo-buys-australian-club","date":"2020-06-17","title":"Former NBA GM Bryan Colangelo buys into Australian club","content":" SYDNEY (AP) \u2014 LaMelo Ball\u2019s bid to be a club owner in Australia hasn\u2019t worked out. The American is expected to be a top pick in the upcoming NBA Draft later this year. The Australian league \u2013 called the National Basketball League \u2013 has announced that a license for the league club the Hawks would go to a consortium led by ex-Philadelphia 76ers general manager Bryan Colangelo. Ball\u2019s business manager, Jermaine Jackson, told ESPN in April that the ownership of the financially struggling club, where the 18-year-old American played last season, was a done deal. But Australia\u2019s NBL issued a statement Wednesday saying the license for the Wollongong-based club had been awarded to a syndicate including Colangelo, Michael Proctor, and former Sydney Kings co-owner Dorry Kordahi. Ball joined the Hawks last year as part of the NBLs Next Stars program and averaged 17 points, seven assists and seven rebounds in 12 games until December, when his season finished because of a bone bruise on his left foot. Colangelo, who also was previously general manager of the Phoenix Suns and Toronto Raptors, said the Next Stars program sparked interest in the league. \u201cLaMelo Ball, among others, serves as a great example of just how influential the NBL has become on a global basis,\u201d he said. NBL owner Larry Kestelman said Colangelos syndicate was the best credentialed to deliver long-term success. \u201cThe decision in choosing the right owners was not an easy one,\u201d Kestelman said in a statement. \u201cI would like, in particular, to thank LaMelo Ball and his organization for the support and interest shown in wanting to achieve the best outcome for the team.\u201d \u201cWe hope we can explore future opportunities with LaMelo and wish him all the best for the NBA Draft in October.\u201d "},{"id":27362,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/coalition-wants-nba-plan-black-causes","date":"2020-06-17","title":"Coalition wants to see NBA's plan for black causes before restart","content":" Los Angeles Lakers guard Avery Bradley and Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving say their players coalition is eager to hear the NBA\u2019s plan on issues of importance to the black community before the NBA\u2019s restart in Orlando, according to ESPN\u2019s Malika Andrews and Adrian Wojnarowski.

He said Monday any players who did not feel comfortable participating in Orlando would not breach their contract. But he suggested the multiple agendas could be served with the game\u2019s return.

It only sounds like vacation. The NBA described very specific plans to players and teams for the restart on Tuesday, doing so in a memo and handbook both obtained by The Associated Press . With safety being of the foremost importance during the coronavirus pandemic, players were told they will be tested regularly \u2014 but not with the deep nasal swabs \u2014 and must adhere to strict physical distancing and mask-wearing policies. The league and the National Basketball Players Association have been working on the terms of how the restart will work for weeks, all while constantly seeking advice from medical experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, perhaps the best-known physician in the country when it comes to the battle against COVID-19, and who has said he supports the NBA\u2019s restart plan. \u201cMy confidence, it didn\u2019t exist at the beginning of this virus because I was so frightened by it,\u201d union executive director Michele Roberts told AP. \u201cNow having lived, and breathed, and suffered through the hours and hours of understanding the virus, and listening to our experts, and comparing different alternative protocols, I can\u2019t even think of anything else we could do short of hermetically seal the players that would keep them safe.\u201d Later Tuesday, the NBA released its medical protocols to teams, a 108-page file. Among the highlights: players must shower in their individual hotel rooms instead of the game or practice arenas, be part of a contact tracing program, and that it is \u201crecommended that coaches wear face coverings pre- or post-game where feasible.\u201d \u201cThe occurrence of a small or otherwise expected number of COVID-19 cases will not require a decision to suspend or cancel the resumption of the 2019-20 season,\u201d the NBA wrote. Most teams will arrive in Florida on July 7, 8 or 9. A person with knowledge of the situation said the reigning champion Toronto Raptors, the lone NBA team based outside of the U.S., will be permitted to gather for some pre-camp workouts \u2014 under strict guidelines that other teams will follow in their own cities \u2014 before that arrival date. The Raptors are likely to train somewhere in Florida, said the person who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because no deal has yet been signed. For the Raptors, it\u2019s been an area of concern largely because of current Canadian government regulations that call for a 14-day quarantine for people returning to Canada. Some Raptors players are in Toronto right now; some are in the U.S. Nobody on the NBA\u2019s Disney campus, which has been loosely described as a bubble, will be allowed in anyone else\u2019s sleeping room. The NBA also told players and teams that it will work with one or more outside health care companies to provide a medical clinic with X-ray and MRI capability on the campus \u2014 critical, since in theory the league would not want players and team staff leaving and potentially facing coronavirus exposure by going outside of the Disney property for such exams. The league\u2019s plan also spells out how training rooms and meeting rooms will be utilized, the procedures for practice-court usage \u2014 three-hour blocks per team, all scheduled, with one open hour in between sessions for cleaning and sanitizing \u2014 and even how team and player laundry will be handled. It also addresses the polarizing issue of how the league and its players will be able to address social injustice and racial inequality \u2014 two issues of constant importance, particularly now across the country. The NBA said it would be \u201ca central goal of our season restart\u201d to bring attention and what it called \u201csustained action to issues of social injustice, including combating systemic racism, expanding educational and economic opportunities across the Black community, enacting meaningful police and criminal justice reform and promoting greater civic engagement.\u201d The league said it remains in talks with the NBPA how best to make that happen. Some NBA players, such as NBPA executive board member Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard, have suggested that playing could take away from the movement to spur immediate and dramatic change on racial issues in the country. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said that if a player does not feel comfortable playing at Disney \u2014 whether for health reasons or because of the social-justice issues \u2014 then he does not have to report with his team and will not be disciplined, other than losing salary for games missed. \u201cThe very fact that our players have the option of not playing, I think says a lot about the commissioner\u2019s ability to appreciate how big an issue this is, not just for African-American players but for all of our members,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere\u2019s not been one ounce of skepticism about the sincerity of the players\u2019 feelings about this.\u201d The NBA is planning on games in three arenas during the seeding-game portion of the restart, the ones where each of the 22 teams going to the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex will play eight games before the playoffs begin. Teams will be housed in three hotels, with between six and eight teams in each. Other plans the NBA has for the restart include mental health professionals being available for players and coaches; pregame chapel services, done virtually; yoga and meditation; three meals a day and four meals on game days; and restaurant availability. Teams can bring up to 35 people as part of the basketball operations group, which includes players, a senior executive, an athletic trainer, a strength and conditioning coach, an equipment manager and security."},{"id":27389,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bam-adebayo-thinking-financial-future-restart-looming","date":"2020-06-16","title":"Adebayo thinking about financial future as restart looms","content":" Bam Adebayo thinks injuries could be more prevalent than usual when the NBA gets back on the floor next month, given the demands that will be on players\u2019 bodies after a long layoff. Miami\u2019s All-Star center is also thinking about the financial risks. Adebayo confirmed Tuesday that he is among five players \u2014 a group who could soon graduate from rookie contracts to extensions worth in excess of $100 million \u2014 seeking assurances from the NBA about if they\u2019ll be protected in the case of catastrophic injury when the season resumes at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida. \u201cOur whole thing was, \u2018Look, we\u2019re all due for extensions and we want to make sure that going into this bubble we are safe and we don\u2019t get hurt,\u2019\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cIf we get hurt, we still have some backups \u2026 something in the back pocket that ensures that we still get paid.\u201d Adebayo said he, Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell, Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum, Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Kyle Kuzma met with the union last week with hopes that the league will pick up at least the majority of the tab for what would be a very costly policy against their future earnings. National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts said Tuesday she is optimistic that there will be some sort of decision that satisfies the players. \u201cThose are still ongoing discussions with the league, but there\u2019s no question Bam and others in that situation are concerned about this,\u201d Roberts told The Associated Press . \u201cThese are issues that are part of the world that we live in and \u2026 these circumstances are unique; he hasn\u2019t played in a while and we have this virus. So, because of the unique circumstances, we are working with the league to get Bam and other players assurances that they are going to be protected.\u201d The cost of such a policy for three months \u2014 which would cover the period in which those players get to the Disney-ESPN complex through the end of the NBA Finals \u2014 is expected to be at least $400,000, a person with direct knowledge of the talks told AP. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because those details have not been revealed publicly. Adebayo intends to play when the season resumes either way, adding that he and Mitchell, Tatum, Fox and Kuzma will likely discuss the matter further. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to play,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t want anybody thinking, \u2018If they don\u2019t get their insurance, they\u2019re not playing.\u2019 No, we want to play. That\u2019s the whole point. We want to play and give our teams the best chance of winning a championship. But at the end of the day we\u2019re also thinking about our families and our lives and how they could change if we get hurt.\u201d By the time games resume on July 30, it will have been more than 4-1\/2 months since the league has seen a real contest. The NBA suspended its season March 11 because of the pandemic, and players couldn\u2019t resume even voluntary on-court workouts for about two months. No team can resume full-scale practices until the arrivals at Disney. Adebayo does not think three weeks of training camp at Disney will be enough to get ready for the resumption of the season, which is why he predicts injury rates will climb. \u201cI hope nobody gets injured, but I think a lot of people will get injured,\u201d Adebayo said."},{"id":27417,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/denver-coach-michael-malone-says-he-had-coronavirus","date":"2020-06-16","title":"Denver coach Michael Malone says he had coronavirus","content":" Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone had and recovered from the coronavirus in March, he told Denver\u2019s CBS 4 on Monday.

The players have lost hundreds of millions of dollars, the franchises and the league itself potentially billions. The NBA\u2019s plan to restart and complete the 2019-20 season and playoffs certainly is an effort to stem that bleeding, preserving as much value as possible for this season as well as 2020-21 and beyond. But NBA Comissioner Adam Silver framed the ambition to return a little differently Monday night: it\u2019s what they do. \u201cA lot of people have pointed to the financial component of this,\u201d Silver said during his appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Return of Sports\u201d. \u201cThe incremental difference at this point between playing and not playing isn\u2019t nearly as great as people think, especially given the enormous expense of putting this on. \u201cIt\u2019s more a sense from the entire NBA community that we have an obligation to try this. Because the alternative is to stay on the sideline. And the alternative is to, in essence, give in to this virus.\u201d Silver participated in the show, structured as a series of interviews with commissioners of the NFL, NHL, MLS, WNBA and major league baseball. Players representing each sport also were interviewed, including All-NBA guard Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers. There\u2019s more than the virus and the challenges it still presents to health and public safety involved, however. Sports leagues find themselves coping with a convergence of serious issues, from the pandemic to the subsequent economic damage to raging public protest triggered last month by the killing of a black citizen, George Floyd, who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes even after he pleaded for air and stopped moving. The resumption of the NBA might seem to pale next to those problems. But Silver indicated it was important for the NBA to play its role on every front. \u201cListen, it\u2019s not an ideal situation,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a way to our own normal in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of a recession \u2014 or worse \u2014 with 40 million unemployed, and now with enormous social unrest in the country.\u201d Attempts to establish that \u201cnormal\u201d include, at the moment, a plan for 22 NBA teams to train and eventually play eight games each, to be followed by a traditional 16-team playoff bracket. The games, all staged on the Disney campus outside Orlando, would run from July 30 to as late as Oct. 13 for a potential Game 7 of The Finals. The \u201cbubble\u201d concept of keeping teams quarantined for anywhere from six weeks to three months still has details to be finalized, as well as approval from both the NBA owners and the National Basketball Players Association. The feasibility of pulling off such a grand experiment was complicated last week when several players, including Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving and the Lakers\u2019 Dwight Howard, voiced concerns about virus safety and, in particular, the optics of the league\u2019s black athletes returning to action when so much besides their jobs is pulling at them. \u201cWith the pandemic,\u201d Lillard told ESPN host Mike Greenberg, \u201cI think basketball will be great for that because it will be us getting back to somewhat normalcy. \u201cAs far as the racial injustice, I think that\u2019s where the struggle is for a lot of the athletes. Our hearts, our minds are with our people. We feel we should be a part of that fight. \u201cThat\u2019s what the struggle is. That\u2019s where you hear a lot of guys coming out saying maybe we should be focused on that instead of going back and jumping into the season.\u201d Silver said discussions of such concerns with the NBPA have been ongoing. He said Monday any players who did not feel comfortable participating in Orlando would not breach their contract. But he suggested the multiple agendas could be served with the game\u2019s return. \u201cFor us, we feel this is what we do. We put on NBA basketball,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cFor the country, it will be respite from enormous difficulties people are dealing with in their lives right now. \u201cI also think in terms of the social justice issues, it will be an opportunity for NBA players and the greater community to draw attention to these issues. Because the world\u2019s attention will be on the NBA in Orlando, Florida, if we\u2019re able to pull this off.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

There are other bigs \u2014 Bam Adebayo is one \u2014 with license to bring the ball up the floor. And there are other bigs \u2014 Marc Gasol is one \u2014 who record assists on more than a quarter of their possessions. But Nikola Jokic is a unique driver of a top-10 offense. He\u2019s all that and his team\u2019s leading scorer, one of two players in 2019-20 \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo is the other \u2014 who lead their team in points, rebounds and assists per game. The Denver Nuggets\u2019 offense is a half-court offense. They rank 29th in pace , 24th in percentage of possessions that take place in transition (according to Synergy play-type tracking), and 29th in effective field goal percentage in the first six seconds of the shot clock (according to Second Spectrum tracking). That half-court offense runs through the 7-footer who leads the league in overall touches (97.6), frontcourt touches (57.8), and passes (75.3) per game. Jokic has accounted for 38% of his team\u2019s assists while on the floor, easily the highest rate among 58 centers who have played at least 750 minutes. With their hub generally stationed in the post or at the top of the key, the Nuggets\u2019 offense is unusual. League-wide, there\u2019s a strong correlation between ball movement and player movement. But the Nuggets (per Second Spectrum) rank seventh in the former (340 passes per 24 minutes of possession), while ranking 26th in the latter (10.7 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession). They pass a lot, but don\u2019t move that much, relative to the rest of the league. Note: The Knicks are the only other team that ranks in the top 10 in ball movement (10th) and in the bottom 10 in player movement (21st). Sometimes, it looks beautiful. Sometimes, it looks clunky. But, despite their lack of proficiency in transition, the Nuggets rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency for the fourth straight season. When the league went on hiatus, they ranked ninth, but there are just 0.3 points per 100 possessions separating the fifth-ranked Celtics from the 10th-ranked Blazers. There are a lot of things a team can do with a 7-footer who scores efficiently \u2014 Jokic\u2019s true shooting percentage of 60.4% ranks eighth among the 40 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher \u2014 and is one of the league\u2019s best passers. The Nuggets\u2019 half-court offense isn\u2019t the best in the league, but it\u2019s maybe the most interesting, given the size and skills of their Kia MVP candidate. Jokic ranks second in the league with 8.2 elbow touches per game , according to Second Spectrum. Those touches are just when he catches the ball near the free throw line , so they don\u2019t count times when Jokic dribbles the ball into the high post. A lot of those elbow touches turn into hand-offs for the Nuggets\u2019 guards and wings toward the middle of the floor. According to Synergy, 7.4% of the Nuggets\u2019 possessions, the league\u2019s second-highest rate , have been handoff possessions. Play 1. The Nuggets run a \u201cpistol\u201d action to get Luka Doncic switched onto Jamal Murray. Murray flips the ball to Jokic and then takes the hand-off. Doncic can\u2019t stay with him and Tim Hardaway Jr. (Murray\u2019s original defender) leaves Gary Harris to help in the paint. Murray kicks out to Harris for an open 3. Denver got three identical 3s \u2014 one , two and three \u2014 taking advantage of that weak-side pinch in the first seven minutes of their Feb. 10 win over the Spurs. Number to know: 93% of the Nuggets\u2019 3-point attempts, the league\u2019s second-highest rate, have been open or wide-open , according to Second Spectrum tracking. Play 2. Don\u2019t blink or you\u2019ll miss Murray inbounding the ball from the baseline and immediately taking a hand-off from Jokic. Courtney Lee gets caught in the screen and Murray hits a wide-open elbow jumper. Number to know: For the second straight season, Jokic and Murray are the only pair of teammates with at least 100 assists to each other. The 123 from Jokic to Murray are fourth-most from one player to a single teammate and the 107 from Murray to Jokic are ninth-most. Play 3. Murray enters to Jokic at the right elbow from a higher angle, so he sets up Hardaway with a two steps to the right before coming back left, taking the hand-off, and draining another jumper over Boban Marjanovic. Number to know: Murray has attempted 286 pull-up 2-pointers , 10th most in the league, according to Second Spectrum. The 46.5% he\u2019s shot on pull-up 2s ranks 17th among 95 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 4. Harris comes out of the left corner to take the hand-off from Jokic, with the other three Nuggets on the weak side. With Shai Gilgeous-Alexander caught in the screen, Nerlens Noel has to switch onto Harris. He forces a tough shot, but Jokic takes advantage of the resulting mismatch with Gilgeous-Alexander to tip in the miss. Number to know: Denver has scored 12.3% of its points as second-chance points, which is the league\u2019s third-highest rate. Play 5. On a sideline out-of-bounds play, the Nuggets set up the hand-off by having Murray set a back-screen for Will Barton. (This play sometimes works for a lob .) Terrance Ferguson switches the back-screen, but Gilgeous-Alexander is then a little late to react to the hand-off. Murray gets Gilgeous-Alexander on his hip and then drains his go-to: a right-shoulder turnaround jumper. Number to know: Murray has taken 42% of his shots between the restricted area and the 3-point line. That\u2019s the 39th highest rate among 229 players with at least 300 total field goal attempts. His 46% on those shots ranks 13th among the 95 players who have attempted at least 200. Jokic\u2019s 53.4% ranks first. Some defenses do not want the ball to get to the middle of the floor, so they try to deny the hand-off going that way. The Nuggets, of course, have a counter. And it results in some of Jokic\u2019s most brilliant passes. Play 1. Murray catches Mychal Mulder leaning and cuts to the basket after feeding Jokic at the high post. Jokic\u2019s return feed is a basic bounce pass that you appreciate more when you see the second replay. Number to know: Fifty-one percent of Jokic\u2019s assists have been on baskets in the restricted area. That\u2019s the 12th-highest rate among 69 players with at least 200 total assists. Play 2. Dejounte Murray tries to get between Jamal Murray and Jokic. The Spurs\u2019 guard is able to stay attached to Murray on the cut and there doesn\u2019t seem to be an angle for Jokic\u2019s pass, so he just creates one on the other side of his own defender. Number to know: Only 48 (39%) of Jokic\u2019s 123 assists to Murray have been on buckets in the restricted area. Play 3. Barton gets Alfonzo McKinnie leaning toward the handoff and Jokic tosses a pass over the defender with one hand. Number to know: Jokic is one of six players with 70 or more assists to at least three different teammates. In addition to the 123 he has to Murray, he has 78 to Harris and 72 to Barton . Phoenix\u2019s Ricky Rubio has 70 or more assists to four different teammates and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James has 70 or more to five different teammates. Play 4. Matt Thomas stays with Barton on the back-cut, but Jokic makes him pay for failing to see both his man and the ball. When he turns back toward Jokic, the ball is already in Barton\u2019s hands. Number to know: The Nuggets rank third in assist-turnover ratio (1.94). According to Second Spectrum, Jokic has averaged 8.1 post-ups per game, fifth-most in the league . He\u2019s also scored 1.06 points per possession on post-ups (per Second Spectrum), the second-best mark among 21 players who have averaged at least 2.5 post-up possessions per game. The most common way the Nuggets get Jokic into the post is with a back-screen from a guard. It usually doesn\u2019t get a switch, but the screen creates space for both Jokic to establish position and for the guy with the ball to make an easier entry pass. Play 1. Jokic initiates the play with a pass to Barton on the right wing and Murray comes up from the block to set the back-screen. Jokic takes Noel into the paint, scores and draws a foul, barely leaving the floor. Number to know: Jokic\u2019s free throw rate of 27.7 attempts per 100 shots from the field is down from 30 over the previous two seasons and ranks 77th among 229 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. Play 2. Two possessions later, Murray calls for Harris to slide up to the wing so they can run the same action. This time, Jokic spins baseline and puts Noel in the blender. Number to know: Jokic has shot 69.4% in the restricted area, the best mark of his career and the 22nd-best mark among 89 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. Play 3. When you handle the ball yourself, there\u2019s no need for an entry pass. Jokic grabs a rebound and dribbles all the way into a post-up against Steven Adams on the other end of the floor, scoring on a drop step. Number to know: For Jokic, 43.8% of his baskets have been unassisted. That\u2019s down from 46.1% last season , but up from 38.5% through his first three seasons. Play 4. Sometimes, it\u2019s Jokic setting the screens that initiate the post-up. This is a play the Nuggets run often where he sets a pin-down screen for Jerami Grant to catch on the wing and then sets a strong-side baseline screen for Harris. That second screen gets Jokic\u2019s own man off his body, so that he can establish position in the post. The result is a very Jokic-y shot over Dragan Bender. Number to know: Only 3% of Jokic\u2019s points have been fast break points. That\u2019s the third-lowest rate among 265 players who have scored at least 300 total points this season. Play 5. This is a \u201chammer\u201d play the Nuggets will run to get a corner 3-pointer in a late-game situation. Jokic gets a back-screen from Harris into a post-up on the right block. Paul Millsap then sets a back-screen for Harris to flare to the left corner as Jokic drives baseline for the hammer pass. Eric Paschall is able to switch out to Harris and run him off the line, though Harris drives past for a layup. Number to know: Jokic has 448 career assists to Harris, including postseason. That\u2019s the most he has to any single teammate, 18 more than he has to Murray. Jokic ranks 10th in the league with 4.3 screen assists per game, but the Denver offense really gets fun when he\u2019s the screenee (probably not a real word) instead of the screener. This isn\u2019t about the back-screens that the Nuggets will often set for Jokic to get position in the low post. This is about Jokic acting as a guard, receiving a ball-screen as a ball handler or coming off a pin-down like a shooter. Play 1. A sideline out-of-bounds play starts as a handoff to Murray, but then has Murray set a pin-down screen for Jokic. With Adams trailing Jokic around the screen, he curls tight to the basket. That draws help from Ferguson and Murray is wide open at the 3-point line. Number to know: Though Jokic ranks eighth in total assists (446), he\u2019s tied for 30th in assists on 3-pointers (127) . Play 2. Here, the \u201cpistol\u201d action has Harris and Murray setting ball screens for Jokic. The second gets him deep into the paint, where he gathers himself for a short jump hook. Number to know: Jokic has shot 60.5% on non-restricted-area paint shots, the best mark among 95 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 3. Jokic is again bringing the ball up the floor himself and gets a high ball screen from Murray. The Clippers, in a role reversal themselves, don\u2019t handle it very well. So Jokic steps into a pull-up 3 like he\u2019s Stephen Curry. Number to know: Jokic\u2019s 31.4% from 3-point range ranks 124th among 135 players with at least 200 3-point attempts. Play 4. Another \u201cpistol\u201d action has Monte Morris setting a screen along the left sideline for Jokic. Derrick White tries to poke the ball away, Morris breaks free, and none of the other Spurs make the effort to stop his drive to the rim. Number to know: The Nuggets rank 27th with 38.9 drives per game . Play 5. Play of the Year. Nothing else to add. Number to know: Jokic has averaged just 3.1 drives per game , but the 59.5% he\u2019s shot on drives is the best mark among 218 players with at least 50 field goal attempts on drives, according to Second Spectrum. One advantage to having your best passer also be your leading rebounder and the guy who brings the ball up the floor is if the defense leaves somebody open, no extra action is needed to get him the ball. Play 1. After a rebound, Jokic has his eyes on Harris, but somehow sees Barton running up the floor with only the 6-foot-1 Terry Rozier between him and the basket. The pass ahead is a little high, but still gets Barton a layup. Number to know: The Nuggets have averaged just 96.9 possessions per 48 minutes with Jokic on the floor. That\u2019s the second-lowest on-court pace mark (higher than that of only Rozier) among 226 players who have averaged at least 20 minutes in 25 games or more. Plays 2, 3. When a Nuggets player contests a 3-pointer, he knows to leak out. Jokic has both the guts and talent to throw 75-foot passes to those guys \u2014 Millsap and Harris in these examples \u2014 on the run. Kyle Lowry sees what\u2019s coming in the second example (he\u2019s running back before Jokic lets go of the pass), but still can\u2019t stop it. Number to know: The Nuggets\u2019 starting lineup \u2014 Murray, Harris, Barton, Millsap and Jokic \u2014 has played 735 minutes, most in the league . It\u2019s averaged 19.3 minutes per game, most among 1,401 lineups that have played in at least five games together. Play 4. The Mavs set up in a zone, but don\u2019t account for Morris in the left corner. Jokic tosses a one-handed dime for the corner 3. Number to know: The Nuggets have scored 1.17 points per possession against zone defenses, according to Synergy play-type tracking. That\u2019s the best mark among the 22 teams that have played at least 100 possessions against zone. When Jokic is in the middle of the floor, he\u2019s difficult to double-team. Every teammate is one pass away and the Nuggets don\u2019t have any non-shooters in their rotation. (Harris was having a rough season offensively, but warmed up after the All-Star break.) He sees over the defense and he sees everything. If the Nuggets are having issues within their offense, Jokic is an escape valve. His size makes it relatively easy to get him the ball, and he has the ability to make something out of nothing, either as a scorer or as a playmaker. The Nuggets have the 12th-best effective field goal percentage overall (53.2%), but they rank sixth in eFG% in the last six seconds of the shot clock (45.5%). Jokic ranks seventh in the league with 190 field goal attempts in the last six seconds of the clock, with only LeBron James and five guards ahead of him. Among the 67 players who have attempted at least 100 shots in the last six seconds, only Bradley Beal (48.5%) has a higher field goal percentage on those shots than Jokic (48.4%). Jokic has also been remarkably clutch late in games. He has shot 49% in the clutch in each of the last two seasons, and since December of 2018, he\u2019s a remarkable 11-for-15 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. * Clutch = Score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. Unfortunately, his clutchness hasn\u2019t carried over to the postseason. In last year\u2019s playoffs, Jokic was 3-for-16 on clutch shots , missing both of his shots for the win in the Nuggets\u2019 quadruple-overtime loss in Game 3 of the conference semifinals. The Nuggets outscored the Blazers by 13 points in that series, but were 1-3 in games that were within five in the last five . The Nuggets are seemingly on a level below that of the Lakers and Clippers in the Western Conference. But they have a high ceiling, and they have a matchup advantage at the center position. Perhaps, being in better shape will help Jokic in the postseason. The way the Nuggets defend pick-and-rolls, mobility is extra important. Maybe his being a little lighter will make his footwork even tougher to keep up with on defense. Maybe his lack of beef will affect his ability to set screens and create space for his soft shots in the paint. No matter what, it will be fun to watch. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

League commissioner Adam Silver stated the following as part of an internal memo : \u201cI spent the weekend watching the protests around the country over the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. As a league, we share the outrage and offer our sincere condolences to their families and friends. Just as we are fighting a pandemic, which is impacting communities and people of color more than anyone else, we are being reminded that there are wounds in our country that have never healed. \u201cRacism, police brutality and racial injustice remain part of everyday life in America and cannot be ignored. At the same time, those who serve and protect our communities honorably and heroically are again left to answer for those who don\u2019t.\u201d On June 1, the National Basketball Coaches Association issued a statement in which they called the events of the past few weeks \u201cshameful, inhumane and intolerable.\u201d \u201cWitnessing the murder of George Floyd in cold blood and in broad daylight has traumatized our nation, but the reality is that African Americans are targeted and victimized on a daily basis,\u201d the NBCA said in its statement. \u201cAs NBA coaches, we cannot treat this as an isolated incident of outrage. \u201cWe are committed to working in our NBA cities with local leaders, officials and law enforcement agencies to create positive change in our communities. We have the power and platform to affect change, and we will use it.\u201d Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was handcuffed and unarmed as a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes despite several pleas that he could not breathe. Here\u2019s what\u2019s being said \u2014 and done \u2014 within the NBA community. * * * Atlanta Hawks  From principal owner Tony Ressler \u201cThis is a time when all of us need to focus on this critical and all too pervasive human issue \u2013 systemic racism. To be as blunt as possible on this topic of dignity, decency and progress, I emphatically believe that you are either part of the solution or you are the problem. Black lives matter. There is no in-between. We, as an organization and part of the Atlanta community, are determined to be a part of the solution.\u201d ( Full statement ) Boston Celtics  From the organization \u201cLike many others across the country, the heartbreaking and senseless deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, along with other recent events, have left the entire Celtics organization struggling with grief and anger. During a time in which the phrase \u2018new normal\u2019 has often been used as our nation has struggled with the devastation of a pandemic, we imagine and hope for a \u2018new normal\u2019 where every citizen is afforded the same rights, has the same opportunities, receives the same treatment, and can peacefully enjoy every freedom promised to all of us.\u201d ( Full statement ) https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaytatum0\/status\/1267191906129391625 Brooklyn Nets  From the organization \u201cNot all of us can ever be in a position to experience the personal pain, fear and despair of Black Americans in light of the events. But our instinct tells us that the lack of respect for human life, fueled by prejudice, is simply wrong. All people, regardless of color, race or ethnicity, deserve to be treated with human dignity and protected from violence. Our hearts are broken by the attacks on the personal safety and dignity of the Black community.\u201d ( Full statement ) From team owner Michael Jordan  \u201cI am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry. I see and feel everyone\u2019s pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough.\u201d ( Full statement ) From president of team charities Nancy Reinsdorf and president and COO Michael Reinsdorf \u201cThere is a crisis in our country, and we need to redouble our efforts and work harder than ever. We have to rise above our differences and come together to affect real change for the future; otherwise we\u2019re going to see the past repeat itself again. We have to listen to each other, act with love and be intentional and relentless in our pursuit of a better world. It is time.\u201d ( Full statement ) Cleveland Cavaliers  From Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman and coach J.B. Bickerstaff  \u201cThis is not the first time that we have had to stand together in an attempt to impact change, but this could be the first time we actually \u201cDO\u201d create change for all of humanity. In the face of desired change, we cannot treat this as an isolated incident of outrage, but one that we remain consistently engaged with and one where we focus our energy toward sustainable accountability.\u201d ( Full statement ) Dallas Mavericks  From the organization \u201cWe will NOT stand for injustice, inequity, and disparity. History goes through phases. Phases in Restoring (justice), Rebuilding (communities) and Rebounding (as people).\u201d Mavericks forward Maxi Kleber shared thoughts via his Instagram story on Sunday: \u201cRacism, discrimination and injustice because of skin color, religion, or other attributes is never acceptable. We are all humans and should work together, to make the world a better place. It\u2019s on us, to educate ourselves and the people around us, to build trust, understanding and a more peaceful world.\u201d Denver Nuggets  From the organization \u201cOur nation is in mourning and in pain as we continue to struggle with the persistent legacy of racism and racial inequality. So often, sports have played a critical role in binding and integrating societies. During some of America\u2019s darkest days, sports have provided a source of light. From Jesse Owens to Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali, selfless and courageous athletes have opened our hearts, eyes and minds. Embracing diversity and accommodating difference to create a symphonic whole, marks a core virtue of any team.\u201d ( Full statement ) Detroit Pistons  From coach Dwane Casey \u201cFifty-four years ago I was an eight-year-old boy living in rural Kentucky when the schools were desegregated. I walked into a white school where I was not wanted nor welcomed. At that time there were no cell phones to record my treatment, no cable news stations with 24\/7 coverage, no social media to record the reality of the situation or offer support nor condemnation. But I can remember exactly how I felt as an eight-year-old child. I felt helpless. I felt as if I was neither seen, nor heard, nor understood. As I have watched the events unfold in the days following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a city where I coached and once called home, I see how many people continue to feel those same feelings \u2013 helpless, frustrated, invisible, angry.\u201d ( Full statement ) From the organization \u201c The protests that have unfolded across our country over the last week and the senseless deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor shine a piercing light on issues of racism, police brutality and inequitable justice that continue to divide our country. As an organization, we condemn those things. But words aren\u2019t enough. The call to action is loud and clear and our organization is committed with a high sense of urgency to helping facilitate not only healing, but change.\u201d ( Full statement ) From the organization \u201cWe condemn, in no uncertain terms, racism and violence perpetrated against members of the Black community, and we call on all people to channel their justifiable anger into creating a more just and equitable society.\u201d Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson joined several of their teammates Wednesday in a peaceful march along Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Warriors swingman Juan Toscano-Anderson organized the \u2018Walking in Unity\u2019 event , which drew several hundred marchers. Kevon Looney and Damion Lee also participated. Houston Rockets  From the organization \u201cWe mourn for and are angered by the senseless death of George Floyd, a man raised in Houston\u2019s Third Ward. Inexcusably, our Black community continues to be subject to racism, bigotry, prejudice and fear. This must end. All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. We condemn violence in all its forms. As an organization, we are committed to working with our players, coaches, employees and community leaders to affect meaningful and lasting change.\u201d Indiana Pacers  From the organization \u201cTragic events in the Black community leave us with a shared sense of sadness and moral outrage. We condemn racism and we fully support those peacefully coming forward in the names of justice and change. Our city and our state are strong and resilient, and we must listen to and respect each other.\u201d Malcolm Brogdon also joined Jaylen Brown in peaceful protests held in Atlanta. LA Clippers  From coach Doc Rivers \u201cMy father was a 30-year veteran of the Chicago police department, and if he were still with us right now, he\u2019d be hurt and outraged by the senseless acts of racial injustice that continue to plague our country. Being black in America is tough. I\u2019ve personally been called more racial slurs than I can count, been pulled over many times because of the color of my skin, and even had my home burned down. The response we are seeing across the nation, to the murder of George Floyd, is decades in the making. Too often, people rush to judge the response, instead of the actions that prompted it. We have allowed too many tragedies to pass in vain. This isn\u2019t an African-American issue. This is a human issue. Our society must start getting comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation and do the right thing.\u201d ( Full statement ) Los Angeles Lakers  From the organization \u201cWe condemn racism, bigotry, violence and prejudice in all its forms. Everyone has the right to live free from fear and to be treated with dignity and respect. We hear the pain of our Black community and we will not stay silent.\u201d Memphis Grizzlies  From the organization \u201cThe Memphis Grizzlies stand squarely in opposition to racism and injustice. We condemn all acts of racial violence. It is engrained in our culture and part of our ethos, and we are going to build on established initiatives in our community. \u2026 We looked internally to understand what additional ways we could support all members of our organization, and recognized that under our current time off policy, staff may have to make a financial sacrifice in order to exercise their right to vote. Knowing fundamentally that change happens at the ballot box , we\u2019ve created a new category of Paid Time Off (PTO) to be used specifically in order to vote so that during local and national elections our staff will never have to make a decision between voting or incurring a financial loss.\u201d ( Full statement ) Miami Heat  From the organization \u201cOne of the characteristics that makes the city of Miami so unique is its immense cultural diversity. This diversity is a celebrated part of South Florida, both inside and out of AmericanAirlines Arena. It is one of the reasons we deeply mourn the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many others, whom we have lost to acts of extreme and excessive violence against African-Americans; acts that have unfortunately become all too commonplace. The Miami HEAT sends their deepest condolences to the Floyd, Taylor and Arbery families. Our hearts are broken. But our resolve is not. We urge everyone to responsibly let their voices be heard and encourage our community to come together.\u201d Heat legend Udonis Haslem also at a protest in Miami, saying, \u201cAs a black man, raising black kids in America, I\u2019m scared as hell, way more scared than I ever was for myself.\u201d From the organization \u201cWe are distraught and angered by the senseless death of George Floyd, but we know this is not an isolated case. Racial biases, abuses of power and injustices continue to plague communities throughout the country, including Milwaukee. There needs to be more accountability. As an organization, we remain deeply committed to address issues of social injustice and to make meaningful change for African-Americans and all marginalized members of our community.\u201d Minnesota Timberwolves  From the organization \u201cOur community is grieving the senseless tragedy and death of George Floyd. The entire Timberwolves and Lynx organization shares its deepest sympathy with the Floyd family. We will work tirelessly to use our voices to influence change, encourage healing, and promote thoughtful action as we move forward.\u201d New Orleans Pelicans  From the organization \u201cOne week ago today, George Floyd was tragically and senselessly murdered. Anger, sadness and protest followed throughout our nation in response to this unjust murder. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of George Floyd. There are no written words, nor the timing of those words that can properly honor the life of George Floyd. We stand against police brutality in any form. Statements are words; unified action towards a solution is what needs to come from this now.\u201d ( Full statement ) New York Knicks  From team ownership group Madison Square Garden Company Every one of us has a role to play in creating a more just and equal society where there is no racism, bigotry, violence or hate. We stand with all who act for positive change. From the organization \u201cWhile great sadness and anger resonates throughout the black community and our entire state and the rest of the nation, we join other leaders in accepting responsibility to continue efforts to expand dialogue and enact real change. We believe that change starts by leading through love, empathy, understanding and leaning on the relationships that we have in place to continue to create a positive impact.\u201d ( Full statement ) From CEO Alex Martins \u201cWe stand with our neighbors and the nation in condemning the horrific and senseless death of George Floyd. There have been far too many victims of racial bias and abuses of power, particularly in the Black community. As an organization, we remain deeply committed to providing an environment where all feel welcomed, valued and appreciated, where all are treated with dignity and respect.\u201d ( Full statement ) Philadelphia 76ers  From the organization \u201cOur black community and people of color continue to face racism, prejudice and injustice. It is unacceptable and we cannot and will not tolerate it in our community. Now, more than ever, we must strive for accountability, including ensuring that our community is treated with fairness, transparency and dignity. We must stay united and strong during the conflict and hurt we are experiencing. The 76ers are committed to using our voice and taking action to support and drive change that is long overdue.\u201d Phoenix Suns  From coach Monty Williams \u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019m afraid. And I\u2019m in pain. When I read those words, I feel like I\u2019m channeling one of my kids. These are the words of a teenager lost and looking for direction in a messed-up world, not the sentiment of an NBA head coach and former player. We\u2019re supposed to have all of the answers. We\u2019re supposed to be seen as grace under pressure. We\u2019re supposed to lead by example. Still, I am angry, afraid and in pain. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I know the solutions start with love, listening, compassion, service and defending those who can\u2019t defend themselves. And I have definitely lost my cool over the years in the face of abject racism \u2014 dating back to my earliest memories growing up in Colonial Virginia \u2014 and likely more in the days to come.\u201d  (Complete open letter ) In an open letter to fans, Aron Baynes says he will do all he can to help the fight for equality . From the organization \u201cWe are devastated and frustrated by the most recent senseless acts of violence in the long continuum of racial injustice in our country. The Trail Blazers organization and players grieve the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and the countless others who have lost their lives in this increasingly familiar manner. This unprecedented moment has challenged us to not be silent but to use our voices, our time and our energy to be genuine allies to those who endure these injustices directly.\u201d ( Full statement ) Sacramento Kings  From team owner and chairman Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 \u201cFor all the hope and promise that our country stands for, the freedom to live without fear from the vitriol and hatred of racism is not a reality for millions of Black Americans. Unfortunately, this is not new. For hundreds of years, innumerable men, women and children have been treated as less than, asked to work twice as hard and taken too early as a result of bias, bigotry and unequal treatment.\u201d ( Full statement ) San Antonio Spurs  Spurs guard Lonnie Walker IV lended an assist by helping clean up the streets of San Antonio on Sunday. A protest Saturday night ended with rioters causing damage to the city\u2019s central business district. Walker IV stated on Twitter that justice can be served while not affecting family businesses and the community. \u201cDuring this protest everyone isn\u2019t seeing eye level but we have to understand we can only control what we can control. The greatest thing I have seen. At least here in San Antonio is that the COMMUNITY is coming together.\u201d The Spurs also started a video series on social media to shine a light on the impact of racial injustices. From team president Masai Ujiri  \u201cEver since I first saw the video, I\u2019ve been thinking about the cycle. A death like this happens, and we rage about it, and the headlines recede, and the world moves on, and then a few weeks later something else happens and we\u2019re outraged again and then we move on, again. We have to stop that cycle. No one can deny the police have a tough job. But they are peace officers. They are supposed to protect all of us. This is the profession they chose. I didn\u2019t see any peace or protection when that officer had his knee on Mr. Floyd\u2019s neck. I saw indifference.\u201d ( Complete open letter ) Raptors star guard Kyle Lowry took to Twitter on June 1 to share his thoughts on all that has transpired of late, writing in part: \u201cHow can I explain to my 4 year old and 8 year old that being black in American comes with a chance you can be harmed, or killed just because of the color of your skin, the texture of your hair, the way you walk, anything they want to say that makes you black!!!\u201d From team owner Gail Miller  \u201cHearts across America, and in Utah, are hurting following events of racism, discrimination and injustice sparked by the recent and senseless death of George Floyd. As I stated on the basketball court of Vivint Smart Home Arena last year, \u2018We believe in treating all people with courtesy and respect as human beings \u2026 no one wins when respect goes away.\u2019\u201d ( Full statement ) Additionally, Jazz coach Quin Snyder will serve on the NBCA\u2019s committee on racial injustice and reform, the team announced June 1. In an episode of The Woj Pod with Adrian Wojnarowski, Snyder explained his getting involved. \u201cIt\u2019s about being willing to have that dialogue, to be transparent with yourself, to be honest with yourself,\u201d Snyder said on the podcast. \u201cUltimately, as a white man, what I was hearing was, We need help. It\u2019s not enough just to have your support. There has to be a willingness to confront these things when you see them, to be willing to take action.\u201d Washington Wizards  A united statement from the players \u201cWe will no longer tolerate the assassination of people of color in this country. We will no longer accept the abuse of power from law enforcement. We will no longer accept ineffective government leaders who are tone-deaf, lack compassion or respect for communities of color. We will no longer shut up and dribble.\u201d From team ownership group Monumental Sports & Entertainment \u201cThe death of George Floyd, and many other black Americans, is unconscionable. We believe that there needs to be action and leadership to tackle and address the social injustices and inequities in systemic racism. We stand together knowing there is more to be done.\u201d * * *"},{"id":27440,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-partners-non-profit-promote-voting","date":"2020-06-11","title":"LeBron James helping start group to prevent black vote suppression","content":" Los Angeles Lakers star and former Kia MVP LeBron James is focused on helping prevent vote suppression of African-Americans by teaming with other athletes and celebrities to start a new voting rights group. According to The New York Times and Reuters , James is starting a group called More Than a Vote, which will be focused on educating and protecting black voters while also energizing more to show up at polls for the Nov. 3 election. \u201cBecause of everything that\u2019s going on, people are finally starting to listen to us \u2014 we feel like we\u2019re finally getting a foot in the door,\u201d James told The New York Times on Wednesday. \u201cHow long is up to us. We don\u2019t know. But we feel like we\u2019re getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reports some of the notable names on board include the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Eric Bledsoe, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green, the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young, the Miami Heat\u2019s Udonis Haslem as well as Alvin Kamara (New Orleans Saints), Sam Perkins, Jalen Rose, Kendrick Perkins and Stephen Jackson (former NBA players), Skylar Diggins-Smith (WNBA) and comedian Kevin Hart. The plan for More Than a Vote comes at a time when Americans are concerned about foreign influence in elections and the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about voting safety and voter suppression. \u201cThere will be an active campaign of suppression,\u201d a person familiar with James\u2019 efforts told Reuters. \u201cThese athletes are the most trusted members of their communities.\u201d James told The New York Times he plans to use his vast presence on social media to combat voter suppression and plans to be vocal about any attempts to restrict voting rights for racial minorities. \u201cYes, we want you to go out and vote, but we\u2019re also going to give you the tutorial,\u201d James told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you the background of how to vote and what they\u2019re trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.\u201d On Tuesday, many people across the U.S. waited hours to vote in person in Georgia\u2019s primary elections. That was especially true in counties with large black populations in and around Atlanta. Per ESPN, the More Than a Vote idea was born by James after the anger and frustration he felt following the death of George Floyd last month. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was handcuffed and unarmed as a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes despite several pleas that he could not breathe. Since that took place on May 25, the NBA, its teams, coaches, players and executives have expressed their outrage over his death via protests , social media posts and other means. Several players \u2014 including Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Malcolm Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Damian Lillard and others \u2014 have either taken part in or led protests in various cities across the U.S. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":27466,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/portland-trail-blazers-mourn-loss-harry-glickman-release","date":"2020-06-11","title":"Trail Blazers mourn the loss of founder, president emeritus Harry Glickman","content":" PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers founder and president emeritus Harry Glickman died today, June 10, 2020. He was 96 years old. Glickman has long been considered the father of professional sports in Oregon, having brought a wide variety of sporting and entertainment events to the region over the course of his long and illustrious career. He was well known for his most famous mantra, \u201cMy word is my handshake.\u201d Glickman\u2019s crowning achievement came in 1970 when the National Basketball Association granted Portland an expansion franchise. Glickman brought together the original ownership group of Herman Sarkowsky , Larry Weinberg and Robert Schmertz, who paid the NBA\u2019s $3.7 million expansion fee. Glickman was one of the shareholders who sold the club to Paul Allen in 1988. Glickman served as the leader of the franchise, including as general manager, from its inception until his retirement in 1994, when he became president emeritus. Under his leadership, the Trail Blazers won the NBA Championship in 1977 and Western Conference championships in 1990 and 1992. Also, during his tenure, the Trail Blazers set an American professional sports record by selling out 814 consecutive home games. \u201cThe Trail Blazers have long been the beneficiary of Harry\u2019s vision, generosity, and inspiration,\u201d said Jody Allen, Chair of the Trail Blazers . \u201cAs the team\u2019s founder and first General Manager, his leadership was instrumental in igniting our city\u2019s pride and passion for sports. I am grateful for Harry\u2019s many contributions to the franchise over the years. He will be missed by many.\u201d Glickman was born and raised in south Portland, graduated from Lincoln High School and in 1948 graduated with a degree in journalism from the University of Oregon. While at Oregon, Glickman worked as a stringer for the Oregon Journal . Following college, Glickman served three years in the U.S. Army, where he saw action in the European theater with the 12th Armored Division, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star. Through the 1950\u2019s, Glickman\u2019s Oregon Sports Attractions promoted a wide range of events, including an annual NFL exhibition game at Multnomah Stadium (now Providence Park), the Shrine Football Game, the Harlem Globetrotters, and world championship boxing via closed-circuit television. Glickman also served as general manager of Multnomah Stadium in 1958 and 1959. In 1960, Glickman founded the Portland Buckaroos hockey team that played in the newly built Veteran\u2019s Memorial Coliseum. In the 12 seasons with Glickman at the helm as the club\u2019s co-owner and president, the Bucks advanced to the Lester Patrick Cup championship seven times, winning three, including the inaugural 1960-61 season, and set numerous attendance records. In 1964, Glickman had the assurance of an NFL expansion franchise from friend Pete Rozelle , who had become Commissioner, but Portland voters rejected the proposed 40,000-seat Delta Dome by a mere 10,000 votes. \u201cHarry was the definition of a true Trail Blazer,\u201d said Chris McGowan, President & CEO of the Trail Blazers and Rose Quarter . \u201cThrough his dedication and persistence, Harry not only created a successful sports franchise in a small western market, but has united hundreds of thousands of people around the world through a shared love of basketball. Rip City will forever be thankful to Harry and his forgotten raincoat.\u201d Glickman was the recipient of numerous honors and awards including: 2019: Honored by the Mighty Endeavor (Veterans\u2019 Legacies) 2019: John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame 2016: University of Oregon Pioneer Award 2012: Oregon History Maker, Oregon Historical Society 1999: University of Oregon Hall of Achievement 1995: International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame 1992: Portland First Citizen Award 1986: Oregon Sports Hall of Fame 1970: Slats Gill Man of the Year (Oregon Sports Awards) 1965:  Hockey News Executive of the Year In 1977, Glickman published his autobiography, Promoter Ain\u2019t A Dirty Word , which is a candid look inside the workings of the professional sports business in Portland. \u201cHarry Glickman laid the foundation and established the benchmark for small market success in the NBA,\u201d said Neil Olshey  , President of Basketball Operations . \u201cHe was the driving force that set the stage for the 1977 NBA Championship, a seminal moment that elevated Portland and allowed it to join the elite of professional sports franchises. His contributions to the city of Portland and the Trail Blazers are immense and for that we all owe him a great debt of gratitude.\u201d Due to the postponement of the NBA season, the Trail Blazers will announce how they plan to honor Glickman at a later date. In Harry\u2019s memory, please consider making a donation to the Oregon Jewish Museum & Center for Holocaust Education , Congregation Beth Israel , or the Jewish Federation of Greater Portland . Glickman is survived by his wife, Joanne, son Marshall, daughters Jennifer and Lynn, grandsons Joel and Laz, and granddaughter Sydney. There will be a private burial service for Glickman. A public memorial service will be held at Congregation Beth Israel at a later date."},{"id":27434,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-allegations-ineligibility-baseless","date":"2020-06-10","title":"Zion Williamson attorney: allegations of ineligibility \u2018baseless\u2019","content":" Attorneys for Zion Williamson\u2019s former marketing agent are continuing their legal push to examine whether the former Duke All-American accepted improper benefits before playing for the Blue Devils, allegations the NBA rookie\u2019s attorney said are \u201cbaseless.\u201d Prime Sports Marketing and company president Gina Ford filed a lawsuit last summer in a Florida, accusing Williamson and the agency now representing him of breach of contract. That came after Williamson had filed his own lawsuit a week earlier in North Carolina to terminate a five-year contract with Prime Sports after moving to Creative Artists Agency LLC. In a court filing Tuesday in the North Carolina case, Prime Sports-Ford attorneys continued to argue that last summer\u2019s No. 1 overall NBA draft pick didn\u2019t meet the definition of a student-athlete because he was \u201cineligible\/permanently ineligible\u201d to play college sports. The filing references housing for Williamson\u2019s family during his time with the Blue Devils as well as three luxury SUVs registered by his mother and stepfather between December 2017 and April 2019 \u2014 the latter being the same month Williamson announced he would go pro before ultimately being picked by the New Orleans Pelicans. That argument about Williamson\u2019s eligibility is center of the legal fight over Williamson\u2019s endorsement potential. Williamson\u2019s lawsuit stated that Prime Sports violated the state\u2019s sports agent law, both by failing to include disclaimers about the loss of eligibility when signing the contract and the fact neither Prime Sports nor Ford were registered with the state. Attorneys for Prime Sports and Ford argue the Uniform Athlete Agents Act wouldn\u2019t apply if he was ineligible to play college basketball from the start. Jeffrey S. Klein, Williamson\u2019s attorney, issued a statement Wednesday that said the latest filing is \u201ca shameful attempt to distract from their admitted violations of North Carolina law.\u201d \u201cAs Duke University stated in 2019, they and the NCAA both investigated and confirmed Mr. Williamson\u2019s student-athlete eligibility,\u201d Klein said. \u201cThe defendants\u2019 baseless allegations are a continuation of the predatory acts the agent statute was designed to protect against. \u201cMr. Williamson looks forward to his day in court in North Carolina and, until then, remains focused on the NBA season and proudly representing his family, fans, and the city of New Orleans.\u201d The Prime Sports-Ford attorneys say they want to question Williamson, his mother and stepfather, as well as Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski in the pretrial discovery process. \u201cThe UAAA does not protect a party who pretends to be a \u2018student-athlete\u2019 nor one who may have concealed prohibited conduct that renders him\/her ineligible and\/or permanently ineligible, but, yet, continues to play in a collegiate sport undetected,\u201d the filing from the Prime Sports-Ford attorneys states. This week\u2019s filing follows last month\u2019s effort in Florida by the Prime Sports-Ford attorneys to have Williamson questioned about whether he received improper benefits, though they offered no evidence of wrongdoing. A judge there initially denied Williamson\u2019s attempt to block that effort, though a Florida appeals court later temporarily granted Williamson a stay to pause proceedings. Duke spokesman Michael Schoenfeld declined to comment Wednesday since the school isn\u2019t a party to either lawsuit. He again referred to a January statement that the school had reviewed Williamson\u2019s eligibility previously and found no concerns."},{"id":27458,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/steve-kerr-nick-nurse-wondering-olympic-plans","date":"2020-06-10","title":"Steve Kerr, Nick Nurse among NBA coaches wondering about Olympic plans","content":" Golden State coach Steve Kerr was supposed to be in Tokyo for the Olympics this summer. And now he\u2019s supposed to be there for the rescheduled version next summer. Then again, Kerr isn\u2019t certain if he \u2014 or anyone else from the NBA \u2014 will be there at all. With the next NBA season not expected to start until at least Dec. 1, that calls into some serious question whether that could overlap with Olympic qualifying tournaments that some nations will need to endure in June 2021 and the Tokyo Games themselves the following month. And Kerr, who is slated to be an assistant under San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich for USA Basketball in Tokyo, said Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t have any idea how the schedule will work. \u201cBelieve it or not, I haven\u2019t had a single conversation with Pop about that,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd the reason is because we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been talking almost daily now for the last couple of weeks and before that we were speaking once every few weeks. So, we haven\u2019t even had a single conversation because there\u2019s nothing to report.\u201d The U.S. is among eight teams who have already qualified for the 12-team men\u2019s tournament at the Tokyo Olympics, which were pushed back a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Americans had a ton of interest from top NBA stars for this summer; now with things delayed a year, USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo has said he and Popovich will wait until the NBA schedule plans for 2020-21 become certain before mapping out an exact plan to build the roster. FIBA pushed back the dates for the four remaining qualifying tournaments to June 29 through July 4, 2021, meaning they would end 19 days before the rescheduled start of the delayed Tokyo Olympics. There will be four different six-team, winner-goes-to-the-Olympics tournaments hosted by Canada, Croatia, Lithuania and Serbia. Toronto coach Nick Nurse is scheduled to coach Canada in that qualifying tournament and, he hopes, the Olympics. But he expects that international travel is one of the last things that will return to normal, or whatever the new normal will be in a world dealing with COVID-19. So, he\u2019s like Kerr and left wondering what\u2019ll happen. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, is my best thought,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know enough to tell you what next season is going to look like. I don\u2019t know. When\u2019s it going to start? I think they\u2019re talking about pushing it back, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to play games closer together. I don\u2019t think so, that\u2019s kind of a thing that everybody\u2019s been happy that they continue to spread them out and lessen the back-to-backs and all those things. \u201cBut if they do that, then it\u2019s probably going to run into the Olympics, or really close to it, right? Lots of things that I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on,\u201d Nurse added. Nurse, Popovich and Kerr surely aren\u2019t the only coaches wondering on this point. Golden State associate head coach Mike Brown is set to coach Nigeria in Tokyo, Toronto assistant Sergio Scariolo will coach Spain and Philadelphia coach Brett Brown will coach Australia. Nigeria, Australia and Spain have joined the U.S. as having earned Olympic berths already, along with host Japan, Argentina, Iran and France. And at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, a record 46 players from the NBA participated. Had the Olympics gone off this summer as planned, even more NBA players could have been there depending on which teams won the final four qualifying spots. If the 2020-21 NBA season starts in December, that would likely mean a May finish to the regular season and serious potential for a schedule collision \u2014 NBA playoffs going off at the same time as the Olympic qualifiers and perhaps the Olympics themselves. The NBA has told players that it is planning for a December start to the season, given that this season\u2019s NBA Finals once things restart next month at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida could last until Oct. 12. But one way the NBA could alleviate the potential for an Olympic problem is to get away from the player-friendlier scheduling models used in recent seasons that greatly lowered back-to-backs and eliminated the dreaded stretches of four games in five nights. If the league did that, it could buy some time and possibly make the Olympics fit on some player and coach schedules. \u201cThey\u2019ve talked to us on our team calls that it might be a condensed schedule next year, more so than in the past,\u201d said Atlanta general manager Travis Schlenk, whose coach \u2014 Lloyd Pierce \u2014 is also scheduled to be a USA Basketball assistant next summer along with Kerr and Villanova\u2019s Jay Wright. Whether that\u2019ll happen or not is anyone\u2019s guess. Until that is known, it is very much a waiting game. \u201cWe\u2019re just sort of waiting to hear what the news is,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIf the news is good and we\u2019re going to be able to take part, we\u2019ll be ready to roll. And if not, we\u2019ll deal with it later.\u201d"},{"id":27424,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/russell-westbrook-produce-series-tulsa-massacre","date":"2020-06-10","title":"Report: Westbrook to produce docuseries on 1921 Tulsa race massacre","content":" Houston Rockets All-Star guard Russell Westbrook is set to produce a documentary series about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, according to Variety.

The six-time NBA champion and the crew of his 80-foot fishing boat named \u201cCatch 23\u201d hauled in a 442.3-pound blue marlin on Tuesday at the Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament, an event held annually off the coast of Morehead City, North Carolina, that attracts anglers from across the world. It\u2019s the fifth-largest blue marlin caught so far during the tournament, which boasts a $3.3 million overall purse. The fish wasn\u2019t big enough to place in the top three, so it is not eligible for prize money. But Jordan and his crew still have two more days to catch a bigger marlin and collect some prize money. The leading blue marlin weighed in at 494.2 pounds. Jordan looked on with smiles as the boat docked and workers hoisted the fish to be weighed on shore. The owner of the Charlotte Hornets later posed for pictures with the rest of his crew alongside the marlin as onlookers cheered and asked for autographs. \u201cI would love to be back with a little bit bigger fish,\u201d Jordan said in a brief interview posted on the tournament\u2019s Facebook page . The tournament pays out for the three largest blue marlins boated with the winner taking home $1.1 million for the largest fish. There is also a $550,000 prize for the first boat to land a 500-pound blue marlin. Crystal Hesmer, the tournament\u2019s executive director, said the atmosphere on shore was \u201celectric\u201d when Jordan\u2019s boat, which included Tar Heel blue colors on the side, pulled into the dock to unload the marlin to be weighed. \u201cOh my gosh, for Michael Jordan to be in our same air space is exciting and thrilling enough, but for him to land a fish at our tournament and bring it in is thrilling for the entire town,\u201d Hesmer told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that he\u2019s here in our little town.\u201d Jordan said he\u2019s participated in other marlin tournaments before, but this was his first in North Carolina.

It\u2019s always great to be able to come back and see some friends.\u201d The six-day tournament runs through Saturday and features 205 boats from around the world. The Big Rock tournament began in 1957. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t win, right now, today, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for supporting the tournament,\u201d Jordan said."},{"id":27459,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/toronto-raptors-restart-decisions","date":"2020-06-09","title":"Raptors still have decisions to make before NBA restarts","content":" The Toronto Raptors have an NBA championship to defend, a very long stay at the Disney complex awaiting them and plenty of unanswered questions on how the restart of the season will work. As the NBA\u2019s lone Canadian team, there\u2019s an added complexity: The U.S. border. Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Tuesday that his team is still working through various scenarios for having workouts before heading to Disney World near Orlando, Florida along with 21 other teams next month for the restart of the season. Teams are expected at Disney around July 7, though the expectation is that the league will permit practices before that date. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really made a final decision on it on a date to reconvene, or where we\u2019re going, or any of that kind of stuff yet,\u201d Nurse said in a call with Toronto media. \u201cWe\u2019ve made plans on both sides of the border, just for doing it as safe as possible. It\u2019s kind of our first and foremost priority \u2014 then maybe as quickly as possible, too.\u201d For the Raptors, the issue of how to proceed largely stems from Canadian government regulations currently in place that call for a 14-day quarantine for people returning to Canada. Some Raptors players are in Toronto right now; some are in the U.S. Getting those players from Canada \u2014 or other countries \u2014 into the U.S. is a process streamlined somewhat by an order signed last month by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf, one that provided the exemption for professional athletes from rules put in place during the pandemic that would have otherwise barred their entry into the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a few options that we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Nurse said. The NBA hasn\u2019t released many details of the plan for how things will work at Disney yet, with many items still being worked out in talks with the National Basketball Players Association and other entities. What is known, however, is a tentative schedule where teams arrive in early July, play begins in late July and Game 7 of the NBA Finals could be as late as Oct. 12. That means a team, if it makes the title series, could spend nearly 100 days at Disney before going home. And if the Raptors choose to have a training camp in the U.S. beforehand, that would obviously add a few more days to their away-from-home total. Nurse said he thinks the NBA is giving teams enough time to get ready between practice and the likelihood of a couple of scrimmages before the games \u2014 seeding games, the NBA is calling them, though they will factor into the regular season standings \u2014 finally begin again.

The 39-year-old Gasol said Tuesday he needs to be playing next season to give himself \u201ca chance\u201d of making it to the Olympics one last time. The Spaniard said he is keeping his options open but going back to the Los Angeles Lakers would be an \u201cattractive\u201d option, as would be returning to a club like Barcelona in Spain. He said a decision on his future will likely have to be made in September or October. Gasol, a three-time Olympic medalist with Spain, has been out of action for more than a year because of a foot injury. He said the coronavirus pandemic has slowed his recovery process, but that was not necessarily a bad thing. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019ve had more time to recover,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Spanish media. \u201cWhen I can start running and jumping I will have a lot more information to know for sure if the foot and the bone are consolidated for me to be playing professional basketball again.\u201d Gasol won two NBA titles while playing for the Lakers, where he stayed from 2008-14. He started his professional career with his home team in Barcelona, where he played from 1998-2001. He also played for the Memphis Grizzlies, the Chicago Bulls, the San Antonio Spurs and the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cMy intention is to play another season if the foot is OK, either in the NBA or in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cA final season with the Lakers is attractive, finishing at Bar\u00e7a is attractive, but you have to see the real possibilities and see what situation would be best for the circumstances of the moment.\u201d Gasol said it was positive that the NBA will be able to finish its season amid the pandemic but hoped the current format changes would not cause future conflicts for players wanting to play in the Olympics next season. Gasol made his comments while launching a free online basketball academy that will run from June 28-July 4. His brother Marc Gasol and San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon will be among those participating in the virtual program."},{"id":27425,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/brian-shaw-head-coach-new-nba-g-league-team","date":"2020-06-09","title":"Five-time NBA champion Brian Shaw named head coach of new NBA G League team","content":" NEW YORK \u2013 Brian Shaw, a five-time NBA champion with nearly 30 years of experience as an NBA player and coach, has been named head coach of the new NBA G League team featuring elite youth prospects, it was announced today by NBA G League President Shareef Abdur-Rahim.

Adams, MD, MPH \u2013 the 20th Surgeon General of the United States \u2013 shares the importance of mental health to overall health and well being. Dr. Adams\u2019 motto as Surgeon General is \u201cbetter health through better partnerships.\u201d In the below Q&A with NBA.com, Dr. Adams discusses why mental health is such an important topic to him personally, the increased need to look after our mental health during these challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers advice on how to help remove the stigma associated with mental health and the barriers that stigma creates to prevent people from seeking the help they need. * * * NBA.com: How would you define mental health? Vice  Admiral  Adams: I define mental health as a combination of our emotional, psychological and social well-being. Our mental health is just as important as our physical health, and is crucial in every stage of life \u2013 from childhood to adulthood. Our mental health affects how we think, feel, and act. It helps determine everything from how we handle stress and relate to others, to the choices we make every second of every day. Can you share why mental health is an important topic to you personally? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 50 percent of individuals will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lifetime, and my own family is no exception. I often share the story of my younger brother Phillip, who has struggled with a substance use disorder (SUD). His struggles are in large part the consequence of long unrecognized and untreated anxiety and depression symptoms. Unfortunately many people attempt to self-medicate their mental health conditions with tobacco products, alcohol, and drugs, and my brother progressed through all three categories of substances. I share Phillip\u2019s story, to underscore that mental health issues, including SUD, can happen to anyone \u2013 even the brother of the Surgeon General. These issues have no bounds. You talk a lot about the importance of mental health to overall health and well-being \u2013 can you help explain? Most people, even children, understand the need to eat right and exercise to promote physical health, but the importance of our mental health is frequently overlooked, or downplayed. Mental wellness helps people to make appropriate choices and engage in productive behaviors when coping with the stresses of life. People who are healthy both physically and mentally are better able to realize their full potential \u2013 in school, on the basketball court, at work, and in life. Just as we recommend you have an annual medical exam where we examine your heart, lungs, etc., it\u2019s important for you and your healthcare provider to have regular discussions and assessments about your mental health. Any medical visit, including a telehealth visit, can be an opportunity to check in on your mental health and well-being and for you to raise any concerns or questions you might have. Studies from the CDC have shown that increased mental wellness is even associated with a decreased risk of diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes. And inversely, untreated mental health issues can make other health conditions, like diabetes, worse. Taking care of our mental health is a component of taking care of our overall health.  People with higher levels of well-being \u2013 that is both mental and physical health \u2013 are even more productive at work and more likely to contribute to their communities \u2013 a point I highlight in an upcoming Surgeon General\u2019s Report on the linkage between community health and economic prosperity. Fully healthy employees help businesses thrive, and create vibrant communities. What are some actions Americans can take during this challenging time to look after their mental health? Health is personal, but the good news is that there are a variety of things that you can do to take good care of your mental health. First of all, it\u2019s important to remember social distancing doesn\u2019t have to mean social isolation \u2013 part of mental wellness is staying connected with others. My own family has kept in touch with many friends and relatives virtually, and my kids have been writing good old fashioned hand-written letters to people they care about. In many ways, this unprecedented time has actually made us closer. Mental health is also about keeping your mind and body occupied, to alleviate boredom and decrease stress. My wife likes reading books and doing puzzles. For me, it means making sure I get in some physical activity \u2013 a walk or run outside or shooting hoops with my kids. For others, it might be listening to or playing music, crafting, or trying out a new recipe. I\u2019ve even been trying out yoga and meditation, and they really do work for me! Regardless of what you choose to help promote your mental health, it\u2019s important to take good care of your body too. Eating healthy and well-balanced meals, drinking plenty of water, avoiding alcohol and beverages high in caffeine or sugar, exercising regularly, and getting plenty of sleep are all things that will improve overall health \u2013 including your mental health. Don\u2019t forget to take medications as directed and to keep watch over any on-going medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. It\u2019s also important to take a time out from activities that you know bring you down, cause angst or stress. For many people right now, that might mean taking a break from social media, or watching the news. What is your advice to Americans who are fearful to seek help because of the stigma still associated with it? To those who are struggling with mental illness, I want you to know that you are not your illness. And talking about it does not show weakness or shame. It shows that you are in tune with your personal health and are managing a condition that many others experience at some point in their lifetimes. One in five Americans will experience a mental illness in any given year. Chances are that you have a friend or family member who is currently struggling or has struggled with their mental health. When we open up, we often find out that we\u2019re not alone in our struggles or challenges. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to today \u2013 whether it\u2019s to find treatment or just to get a little support, I encourage you to call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). It\u2019s confidential, free, and available 24\/7 and 365 days a year. I also encourage everyone to visit the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) hub for mental health resources in the wake of COVID-19. There you\u2019ll find free and confidential resources, tips for coping with stress and anxiety, and can get connected with a trained counselor in your area. If you\u2019re looking for help talking to a loved one about their mental health, you\u2019ll also find tips on how to start the dialogue and let them know you care. How can we help remove the barriers that prevent people from getting the care they may need? I serve on the Executive Committee of the National Action Alliance to End Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance), and we are currently working to address this very question. While the Action Alliance is largely focused on suicide prevention, many central themes of their work are rooted in broader mental health conditions. In this modern era, it\u2019s critical we improve access to care, reduce the conditions that can lead to suicide, and open up a public dialogue on this subject. Just as we have been working to change the conversation about suicide prevention, we must also eliminate policies that reinforce stigma about seeking mental health treatment. I advocate daily to eradicate stigma, whether related to a physical or mental health condition, substance misuse, socioeconomic status or other causes, and I encourage everyone to do the same. Stigma keeps people in the shadows. It keeps people from getting help. But by opening up and sharing our stories, and by seeking support when we need it, we can shatter stigma and all that it represents. The single most important thing we can do to promote mental health, is to talk openly and often about it, and encourage those with mental health symptoms to seek care! How do you think public perception of mental health has changed or advanced over the last 5 years? I am glad that the perception of mental health has been changing. Organizations like the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Football League (NFL) \u2013 as well as their players \u2013 are talking about it. Military leaders now recognize mental wellness as critical to the health of our soldiers and the security of our Nation. Communities are taking action to reduce stigma surrounding mental illness and its treatment, and our young people are recognizing and speaking about mental health in ways we\u2019ve never seen before. By pairing spokespeople like NBA stars Kevin Love and Keyon Dooling with social media and the ability to reach millions in milliseconds, I think our country is really starting to understand that mental health is key to our broader well-being. Unfortunately we\u2019ve also seen far too many high profile overdoses and suicides among celebrities. This has shown us that money, fame, and resources don\u2019t guarantee good mental health, and can\u2019t protect you if you don\u2019t seek help. That\u2019s why one of the most powerful actions we can take to empower people to seek help if needed and reduce stigma is to use our voices \u2013 to speak up and speak out against stigma when we hear it, tell our own stories, and to provide space for others to do the same. The federal government, including CDC, the National Institutes of Health , and SAMHSA, offer a wealth of programs and resources to help Americans improve their mental health. I currently serve as an ambassador on the President\u2019s Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End the National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) Task Force, an effort arising from President Trump\u2019s executive order. Together, the task force is using a multipronged public health approach to change the way all Americans think about, talk about and address mental health broadly \u2013 and suicide in particular. It also focuses on identifying and promoting effective evidence-based programs in communities across the nation while expanding the suicide prevention research ecosystem. These are important conversations that can have a meaningful impact on the future of mental health."},{"id":27493,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/atlanta-hawks-eye-future-young-talent","date":"2020-06-09","title":"Young Hawks enter uncertain offseason with growing up in mind","content":" The complexities involved in an unprecedented nine-month offseason leads to a list of contingencies longer and more detailed than any NBA executive or coach can explain in a timely fashion. The possibilities, as you\u2019d expect, are endless, based on what the league will allow the eight teams not involved in next month\u2019s 2019-20 season restart in Orlando. That might explain why Hawks president of basketball operations and general manager Travis Schlenk is all-in on a proposal to have some sort of restructured offseason that could potentially allow for joint work (practices, scrimmages, etc.) involving those eight teams. That idea, Schlenk said, is still in the planning stages. The overall goal is to have a concrete plan for the Hawks (and the seven other teams) included in whatever final proposal that must be ratified by the league and National Basketball Players Association before the tentative July 31 restart. \u201cOur objective and our goal certainly would be when the union and the league go through the Orlando proposal that we\u2019re included in that, so that\u2019s why there is certain some time pressure on us to get that in,\u201d Schlenk said on a Tuesday morning Zoom call with reporters. \u201cAnd as you can imagine, when you get eight different franchises together, everybody has kind of a different view of what they are trying to accomplish. So, we\u2019ll get something in and we want to be a part of that so when they do ratify the Orlando plan there will be something in there for the eight of us who aren\u2019t going [to Orlando].\u201d The Hawks have obvious offseason goals, including adding depth to a young and still-developing roster while also focusing on the growth and development of a \u201ccore five\u201d that includes All-Star guard Trae Young, big man John Collins, wing player Kevin Huerter and rookies Cam Reddish and De\u2019Andre Hunter. Young is already a star, having been voted in as an All-Star starter in his second NBA season. Collins played at another level when he returned to action after serving a 25-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s anti-drug policy. Huerter, Hunter and Reddish all flashed signs of being building blocks, too. That \u201ccore five\u201d doesn\u2019t include veteran center Clint Capela (who was acquired via Houston on Feb. 5 but never suited up because of a foot injury) and rookie center Bruno Fernando. Those seven players will serve as the backbone of the team Atlanta fields once the 2020-21 season begins. Coach Lloyd Pierce is tasked with ensuring that group shows up to next fall\u2019s training camp locked in on that growth mindset he\u2019s stressing. It is also what makes whatever the next phase of this offseason rebuilding plan crucial. Even with the final 15 games of the season cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pierce saw enough to know the Hawks remain focused on a playoff push \u2014 which he expects his team to make next season. Pierce praised the development of Atlanta\u2019s young core and changes to the roster. He\u2019s also grateful for the veteran leadership and presence Capela and big man Dewayne Dedmon bring. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely encouraged and excited about the guys that we have,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cSo we\u2019re on the path we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time, building through the Draft and adding some veteran leadership and then, you know, looking forward what we\u2019ll be able to do with our cap space and free agency over the next two summers is really encouraging. \u201cBut it starts with our young guys and what we\u2019ve seen from them, especially when they\u2019ve been able to play together.\u201d How much time they get together during this offseason remains the great unknown. Schlenk echoed Pierce\u2019s sentiments about the growth of the young core dating back to Collins\u2019 rookie season in 2017-18. The Hawks have also maintained their cap flexibility and Draft assets, which sets them up for a bright future. But he also acknowledged that the uncertainty surrounding this unprecedented offseason comes with concerns. Even with twice-weekly Zoom calls and facilities opening back up recently for individual work, the ability to work with the entire group in competitive situations is not permitted. Without the usual NBA Summer League component, and the mini-camp that precedes it, digging in on that group dynamic can only be done virtually until that final proposal is finished and ratified. All told, the Hawks cannot afford an extended layoff that could stunt the continued growth of their youth. \u201cI think that\u2019s obviously a concern,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cOne of the most important things for our guys is to continue to play. So being able to play in the summer \u2014 you know, pick-up games or Summer League\u2019s obviously not going to happen this year. All those things are important for young guys as they continue to get better.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Spurs announced Monday that Aldridge had the surgery on April 24, stemming from an injury he suffered in a game at Utah on Feb. 21. \u201c If you can remember, before things shut down, he had the initial injury back in late February to the shoulder and missed a couple weeks, came back and played in the Dallas game,\u201d Spurs general manager Brian Wright said via online chat. \u201cWe tried to take advantage of the hiatus period with rehab and him working to get back. Unfortunately, it just didn\u2019t progress the way that we all had hoped. The best pathway from there was the surgical procedure. So, we decided to move forward with that and get him ready for next season.\u201d San Antonio is one of the 22 teams will that report to the ESPN Wide Wide Of Sports complex at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida, starting next month, when the NBA plans to resume its season.

The gap between those four teams is .010 percentage points. Aldridge played in two more games after getting hurt, including one on March 10, when he scored 24 points in the Spurs\u2019 win over Dallas. The NBA suspended its season the following day because of the coronavirus pandemic. Aldridge turns 35 next month. He finished this season averaging 18.9 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. The Spurs say Aldridge \u201cis expected to be fully cleared for all basketball activities\u201d in time for training camp ahead of next season.

But the plan is in place for the league to resume the 2019-20 season. If the plan comes to fruition, it will be basketball unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen. The experience of watching the NBA playoffs in a small arena with no fans will be weird. But it will be real basketball with real stakes, real results, and a real champion will be crowned. The players will be on the same teams that they were in March, but, even beyond the no-fans thing, it may feel like a very different season. What we\u2019re in the middle of right now is not an All-Star break. It\u2019s 20 weeks off . There is no precedent for it. With a few exceptions (Kevin Durant, John Wall, etc.), we\u2019ll assume better circumstances for teams that weren\u2019t so healthy before the season went on hiatus.

And while there are obvious and multiple reasons for the willingness to cope with the complex chore of saving the season here in the rubble of COVID-19, here\u2019s the most meaningful one: LeBron James. The sport\u2019s box office king is healthy, hyper and, last we saw, still serving up quality basketball. Therefore, this is the tonic for a league and its network partners looking to recoup staggering losses from a four-month delay, and for legions of fans starved for live basketball drama instead of a documentary from a foregone era. And its a tonic for a 35-year-old legend who knows this could be his best or only chance to win a title with his third team. Yes, LeBron is ready to rescue the NBA, and vice versa. Would the league be so hell-bent on moving mountains to resume play if, say, LeBron was hurt and unable to suit up? Well, perhaps so. But with LeBron having a reasonably strong chance of reaching the finish line with the Los Angeles Lakers, and maybe raising his arms in celebration if he breaks the tape, there\u2019s a bit more urgency by all parties to see this through. With all due respect to the Milwaukee Bucks and the defending-champion Tornoto Raptors and the Clippers rising up on the other side of L.A., they aren\u2019t the engine that\u2019s powering this undertaking. If LeBron and the Lakers are just as good over the next several weeks as they were the first several months, the intrigue and the ratings will be worth the wait. It won\u2019t matter that there won\u2019t be any collective gasps coming from the empty stands, or that this will take place in a disinfectant-filled basketball bubble in Orlando, or that these games will be devoid of a postseason-charged atmosphere. Stripped of all that, the basketball world will still get what it wants: LeBron and his big-market team in the championship hunt. Folks will either root for LeBron to get his fourth championship or be fascinated to see how he fails. And that translates into a bonanza for the league, because only LeBron is capable of selling tickets to an event that literally isn\u2019t selling any. March may seem like a decade ago, but your hazy memory might recall that the last time we saw LeBron, he\u2019d just finished buzz-sawing through his two biggest threats, the Bucks and Clippers. He was epic in those consecutive games, crushing their souls and spirits and coming through in the moments of truth. Essentially, he abruptly changed two major conversations \u2014 Kia MVP and title favorite \u2014 in just three rapid-fire days. And he\u2019s anxious to change another buzz, too. While \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d stole the basketball audience during the national lockdown, LeBron was busy hibernating and therefore powerless to give a rebuttal to the GOAT debate that raged after that documentary. It\u2019s quite possible, then, that LeBron is more desperate for basketball than you or anyone else on the planet. When the league was forced to pull the plug on March 11, the season was swaying in LeBron\u2019s direction. Unlike in 2018-19, he was the picture of health and stamina, playing 60 of 63 games, burning through 35 minutes a night and barely breaking a sweat. Even better, he was feeling frisky and saucy, leading the NBA in assists , meshing with co-star Anthony Davis and helping the Lakers take regular-season ownership of the West. His vital numbers: 25.7 points, 7.9 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He dropped performances we don\u2019t normally see from players with this much career tread wear on their limbs: 40 points against the Pelicans, 32-14-12 against the Nuggets, 35-16-7 against Dallas, and near triple-doubles against the Bucks and Clippers. He was a more active and willing defender, improved 3-point shooter in volume and efficiency, and still capable of entertaining with signature dunks, passes and finishes. The closing chapters to his career were being written in boldface. There\u2019s certainly a chance that LeBron and others might emerge rusty or out of rhythm from the four-month layoff. The flip side is the ample rest will refresh and reinvigorate him, and only help maintain, if not enhance, the pace he had already set for himself and the Lakers. Surely, LeBron didn\u2019t waste his time during the layoff binging on Netflix. There\u2019s far too much at stake for him to waste an opportunity, so a player who annually spends almost $1 million on his body certainly took care of business in ways others couldn\u2019t. Without question, the incentive for LeBron only rose during the layoff. He knows the historical ramifications of doing for the Lakers what he did for the Heat and Cavaliers. How many players have won three titles with three different teams and were the best players on those teams? Do a documentary on that; it\u2019ll be about four seconds long. An appropriate way to label this, his 16th season, might be to call it \u201cThe Last Chance.\u201d Because there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll ever get this close to the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy with the Lakers again. Next season, the Golden State Warriors will emerge from their one-year reset feeling restless and reloaded. The Brooklyn Nets will bring a healthy Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. And the Clippers and Bucks aren\u2019t going south anytime soon. Plus, the 2020-21 Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz should lurk as spoilers in the West, too. Thankfully, a pandemic didn\u2019t cost LeBron at least a try at another championship. That would\u2019ve been ranked high on the NBA\u2019s list of what-ifs in the history of great players with legacy gaps, right behind Jordan tossing away roughly two years of championship hoops so he could satisfy an itch to shag fly balls in the minors. LeBron\u2019s basketball clock is indeed ticking. Yes, he\u2019s still bringing \u201cA\u201d games most nights, but his health and his high standard of play aren\u2019t automatically transferred from one season to the next \u2014 not here in the sunset years. Besides, Davis is rarely the picture of perfect health himself and he might stumble physically next year. The rest of James\u2019 teammates, given their ages and short contracts, are transient. Sports have taught us time and time again that nothing can be taken for granted. LeBron can still crown a superb season. He can save the NBA, and by restoring the basketball season, the NBA can save him. As the sporting country creeps ever so slowly toward a sense of normalcy, fans need basketball strictly from a diversionary standpoint. But make no mistake: Now more than ever, a league and a superstar need each other even more. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It was an issue that needed clarity because the 22 teams that will be going to the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida, for the planned resumption of the season next month will not have played the same number of games. The NBA told teams of the plan for utilizing tiebreakers in a memo late Friday. Based on the league plan for the restart, with games starting again in late July, Dallas will end up playing an NBA-high 75 contests. Most others will play between 72 and 74; the low total will be 71, which San Antonio and the Los Angeles Lakers will finish at if the NBA\u2019s plans for teams to play eight games at the Disney complex before the playoffs begin comes to fruition. The NBA has not yet revealed how team schedules will be adjusted once play resumes without Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Golden State, Minnesota and New York taking part in the remainder of the 2019-20 season. There are some playoff races that are particularly close and where the teams involved will end up playing a different number of games. In the East, Brooklyn and Orlando are separated by a half-game and the Nets will end up with one less game than the Magic. In the West, four teams \u2014 Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento and San Antonio \u2014 are all separated by a half-game in the race for ninth place and potentially a berth in a play-in series. The gap between those four teams is .010 percentage points, and the Trail Blazers will play 74 games, the Pelicans and Kings will both play 72 and the Spurs 71. Typically, NBA teams play 82 games \u2014 which wasn\u2019t possible this season because of the coronavirus pandemic and the suspension of the season on March 11. This will be the first season in which NBA teams play an uneven number of games since 2012-13, when a game between the Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers was canceled in response to the Boston Marathon bombing. The Celtics and Pacers finished at 81 games, though that did not have any impact on playoff seeding that season."},{"id":27500,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gregg-popovich-spurs-shift-focus-race","date":"2020-06-06","title":"Gregg Popovich delivers stirring statement as Spurs focus on race","content":" SAN ANTONIO \u2014 San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich cut straight to the root of why he believes our country is in trouble: \u201cThe basic reason is race.\u201d In an emotional video released Saturday by the San Antonio Spurs as part of their #SpursVoices series on social media, Popovich called for white citizens around the country to \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d and call out racial injustices no matter the consequence. \u201cWe have to speak. We have to not let anything go,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack people have been shouldering this burden for 400 years. The only reason this nation has made the progress it has is because of the persistence, patience, and effort of the black people. The history of our nation from the very beginning in many ways was a lie. We continue to this day, mostly black and brown people, to try to make that lie a truth so that it\u2019s no longer a lie, and those rights and privileges are enjoyed by people of color just like we enjoy them.\u201d Popovich\u2019s stirring words come as the organization works to \u201cfacilitate a conversation across our communities,\u201d Spurs CEO R.C. Buford told NBA.com on Saturday. Their goal is to use this as a tipping point for an organizational commitment toward \u201cactively engaging in purposeful, change-focused programming.\u201d The organization plans to continue publishing its #SpursVoices series across their 26 digital platforms through next week. In the past, the Spurs had never made an organizational decision to focus its priorities on matters regarding race. That quickly changed in the wake of the death of George Floyd, who died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, forced his knee into the back of Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes during an incident caught on video by a bystander. The officer now faces second-degree charges for murder and manslaughter, while the other three officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death were charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. \u201cIt\u2019s almost, in a strange, counterintuitive sort of way, the best teaching moment of this most recent tragedy I think was the look on the officer\u2019s face,\u201d Popovich explained in Saturday\u2019s #SpursVoices video. \u201cFor white people to see how nonchalant, how casual, how just every day going about his job so much so that he could just put his left hand in his pocket, wriggle his knee around a little bit to teach this person some sort of a lesson, and it was his right and his duty to do it, in his mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just embarrassed as a white person to know that could happen; to actually watch a lynching. We\u2019ve all seen books. You look in the books, and you see black people hanging in trees. You are amazed. We just saw it again. I never thought I\u2019d see that with my own eyes in real time.\u201d As protests condemning police brutality broke out around the country, and locally in San Antonio, a team of Spurs executives started a lengthy email exchange Saturday night that led to meetings lasting late into Sunday. The club reckoned with how to proceed, knowing it needed to take an impactful organizational stance. As the executives brainstormed into the night, Brandon James, their vice-president of basketball administration and deputy general counsel, came up with the idea to put together the #SpursVoices series. But before the organization decided to lend a hand to the outside world, it first wanted to address matters internally. In the past, the Spurs had engaged the players on numerous occasions by bringing in various speakers such as Michael Eric Dyson and John Carlos to speak with the team. This time, the executives wanted to engage the entire organization. On Monday morning, the Spurs called an internal townhall on a video conference that swelled to more than 300 staffers, including Popovich, Buford, James and general manager Brian Wright, as well as Spurs Sports & Entertainment Chairman Peter J. Holt. The emotional meeting lasted nearly three hours and gave various staffers \u2014 ranging from security guards to staff in the ticket office \u2014 the opportunity to share their personal stories involving experiences with racism. The club also consulted with various experts in fields regarding matters of race, including Dr. Richard Lapchick, founder and director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics In Sport. A natural connection already existed with Lapchick; he mentored Wright while the Spurs executive worked toward a master\u2019s degree in sports business management from the DeVos Sports Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida. The executives emerged from Monday\u2019s meeting shaken by what the staffers had shared. \u201cIn the last week I have had the opportunity to sit and listen to the voices of members of our organization,\u201d Holt said in a  #SpursVoices video published June 5. \u201cThe anger, the pain, exhaustion and sadness I heard in these impactful stories was agonizing and heart-wrenching. It shook me to my core. \u201cI fully recognize that I\u2019m a white male. On top of that, I was born into a privileged name and a wealthy family. My family always pushed me to be educated and knowledgeable, especially in regard to our society, our history, culture, and just overall humanity. I have been blessed in my life to experience many different people and places. I\u2019ve been blessed to have relationships with incredible and amazing people of different races, religions, ethnicities, backgrounds, places of origin. Because of this, I thought I understood race. I now fully realize that I do not understand. I must listen and learn now more than ever. \u201cAs an organization,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe believe we can do more to help address the systemic racism in our society, and we embrace this opportunity. Leadership is not defined by title and status. It is defined by purpose, behavior and action. We have incredibly strong and thoughtful leaders in every area of our Spurs family. I\u2019m grateful for their willingness and courage to tackle this complex and important issue. I also know that I must do more. Together, we will put the full weight of our organization behind this critical effort.\u201d Holt made that decision in the wake of Monday\u2019s meeting, believing the Spurs had a duty to work toward enact ing lasting change. The #SpursVoices video series launched on Wednesday with the club posting multiple videos on its 26 digital platforms every day since. \u201cWe\u2019re listening,\u201d James said Wednesday, when the team\u2019s video series first launched . \u201cWe\u2019re pressing pause amidst all that\u2019s going on to listen to our people; what they\u2019re feeling, what they\u2019re experiences have been, what we can do together to impact change.\u201d  Popovich stressed the need for white citizens to speak up if real change is to be achieved. \u201cIt\u2019s like the neighborhood where you know there\u2019s a dangerous corner, and you know that something\u2019s gonna happen someday and nobody does anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, a young kid gets killed and a stop sign goes up. Well, without getting too political, we\u2019ve got a lot of stop signs that need to go up quickly.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Coaches are seeing potentially a bigger purpose as well. Many players and coaches have spoken out in recent days following the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. But two coaches said Saturday that once the league arrives at Disney, they would expect the NBA\u2019s visibility t o be an asset again in the hope for actual change. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is really ready to move on.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has talked at length about it in recent days as well, with numerous internal staff conversations on the topic going on this past week even as the league was finalizing the return-to-play proposal that the Board of Governors approved Thursday and players ratified Friday. Orlando coach Steve Clifford also seems convinced that the league\u2019s players and coaches will take some sort of action when the season resumes. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s priority right now and hope is that we can all be part of the change that\u2019s so necessary in our country. We\u2019ll have a collective platform where everyone can collectively send a message condemning racism, racial injustice, calling for police accountability. There will be a platform and I think we\u2019re all thinking that way.\u201d Many of the league\u2019s biggest names have used social media to condemn police brutality and racial injustice, and some NBA players have also appeared at demonstrations and marches around the nation in recent days. > NBA players join marches across the country The National Basketball Coaches Association has also said that it will work collectively to find answers and determine the best courses of action.

Spoelstra has been on several calls with political leaders in South Florida in recent days for that same purpose. He also said Saturday that the current racial strife in the country took him back to how Heat players responded in 2012 after the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer \u2014 as well as countless other incidents. \u201cWe all thought that that was going to move the needle and it didn\u2019t and it broke your heart,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd then when that happens over and over and over \u2026 what this is going to require is not even trying to evaluate, it\u2019s just put your head down and get into this fight, and make it happen this time.\u201d * * *"},{"id":27483,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chicago-bulls-no-decision-jim-boylen","date":"2020-06-06","title":"Bulls not ready to announce decision on Jim Boylen\u2019s future","content":" CHICAGO (AP)  \u2014 The Chicago Bulls\u2019 new top basketball executive wasn\u2019t ready to make any announcements about the coaching staff on Saturday. Arturas Karnisovas still has not met in person with head coach Jim Boylen. And that\u2019s something he would like to do before going public with any decisions. Boylen\u2019s future is the biggest issue hanging over the Bulls, who were left out when the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors approved a 22-team format to restart the pandemic-interrupted season next month in Orlando. Chicago has missed the playoffs in four of the past five seasons, a tough stretch for a franchise whose dominance in the 1990s was chronicled in the ESPN documentary \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d The Bulls overhauled their front office when they hired Karnisovas as executive vice president of basketball operations in April and Marc Eversley as general manager a few weeks later. Boylen remains on the job. But for how much longer? \u201cI haven\u2019t met face to face yet,\u201d Karnisovas said during a conference call. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any practices. There haven\u2019t been any games since I became a part of this organization. I really take pride in my relationships that I cultivate with coaching staffs, my basketball operations staffs. I haven\u2019t seen them. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d The Bulls came into the season hoping to contend for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. But the plan did not come to fruition. Chicago was 22-43 before play was stopped in March and quite a bit has changed since the team walked off the court for the final time. John Paxson, a link to the franchise\u2019s glory years, moved into an advisory role after leading basketball operations for 17 years, and Gar Forman was fired as general manager. Karnisovas is in charge and says he\u2019s on his way to Chicago, though he wouldn\u2019t say when he expects to arrive. Eversely is not in town yet, either. But they\u2019re starting to lay the groundwork, hoping to lift a struggling franchise. Boylen\u2019s status and a potential coaching search top the to-do list. At 39-84 in just under two years and with a new management team in place, he appears to be on borrowed time. The only Bulls coach with a worse record than Boylen is Tim Floyd (49-190). But if a change is coming, don\u2019t expect an announcement soon. With potential replacements possibly tied up until October \u2014 when the delayed 2019-20 season concludes \u2014 the Bulls have time. \u201cI know that you are anxious for me to comment definitively on our future of the Chicago Bulls,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cI understand that anticipation. That said, I take pride in being deliberate and thoughtful in my decision-making and take the weight of my decisions seriously. I\u2019m not inclined to make evaluations prematurely to satisfy our excitement to move this team forward.\u201d Karnisovas said the Bulls lobbied the league to be included among the teams that resume the season. He hopes the eight teams not going to Orlando will be allowed to practice and scrimmage during this extended offseason. After all, they will likely go about nine months between meaningful games with new season expected to start in December. No matter who is coaching, the Bulls need to get more out of Lauri Markkanen. The 7-footer from Finland averaged 14.7 points and 6.3 rebounds, down from 18.7 and 9.0 the previous season. \u201cI spoke to him about last year,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cHe\u2019s eager to get back to the gym and improve. He was disappointed, obviously, by the overall result. Every player wants to win. He\u2019s about winning, as well. Our objective is to get the best version of Lauri next year.\u201d Karnisovas said he doesn\u2019t anticipate any more changes to the front office. Besides him and Eversley, the Bulls also hired vice president of player personnel Pat Connelly and assistant general manager J.J. Polk. Holdovers such as director of pro personnel Jim Paxson appear safe for now. The Bulls are slotted for the seventh overall selection in the draft. Unless they move in the lottery, it will be the fourth year in a row they wind up with that pick. Chicago acquired the rights to Markkanen in that spot from Minnesota in 2017. The Bulls took Wendell Carter Jr. and Coby White at No. 7 the next two years."},{"id":27506,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/durant-confirms-he-wont-return-nba-restart","date":"2020-06-06","title":"Kevin Durant confirms he won't return for NBA restart","content":" While the NBA is making plans to resume the 2019-20 season next month, Kevin Durant has aleady ruled himself out until next season. \u201cMy season is over,\u201d Durant told The Undefeated on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on playing at all. We decided last summer when it first happened that I was just going to wait until the following season. I had no plans of playing at all this season.\u201d In the wide-ranging interview with Mark J.

It gives me more time to get ready for next season and the rest of my career.\u201d Durant went into detail about how he has been affected by the tragic death of Floyd and what he is doing to bring awareness to police brutality and injustice.

It\u2019s getting closer, but the league isn\u2019t there yet. The move to agree on a 22-team format for the resumption of the pandemic-interrupted season is a major step forward, but it was just the first of many major decisions that has to be completed before the league moves into the ESPN Wide Wide Of Sports complex at the Disney campus near Orlando next month. Another step was completed Friday as expected when the representatives from the National Basketball Players Association voted to unanimously approve the proposal that the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors approved a day earlier. More talks and negotiations are scheduled for the coming days to work out everything else, and it is a sizable list. A look at some of the other issues facing the league, both in the quest to finish this season and then what awaits in the coming year: The format was significant, but not the biggest hurdle for the NBA to clear in this process. That one, by far, is testing. The medical protocols are the most critical part of the return-to-play plan. The league and the players know they must go above and beyond in the interest of safety. The protocols are the key \u2014 players will have to practice social distancing when they aren\u2019t playing, plus submit to a quarantine at the beginning of the time at Disney and likely daily testing for the entirety of their stay there. Players and coaches likely won\u2019t even be able to have their families at Disney until September, at the earliest. A person with direct knowledge of the talks said the NBA and NBPA have been working on what will be lengthy protocols \u2014 which, among other things, will explain what happens when a player or coach tests positive while at the Disney complex. The season is set to resume July 31, with playoffs starting in mid-August and leading up to an NBA Finals that could stretch until Oct. 12. Other than Milwaukee and the Los Angeles Lakers, who are all-but certain of going into the playoffs with No. 1 seeds, everyone at Disney will be playing for something \u2014 a playoff seed or a playoff spot. The dynamic at the bottom of the East is fascinating with Brooklyn and Orlando separated by a half-game \u2014 and Washington just 1-1\/2 games out of getting into a two-game play-in series for the No. 8 spot. Out West, expect craziness with six teams basically assured of vying for one berth. Whichever team emerges from that mess will be playoff-ready and loaded with confidence heading into Game 1 of Round 1 against the Lakers. That means the Lakers might have to be playoff-sharp right away, because LeBron James and his teammates will open against a team that\u2019s hot. Consider this: Detroit didn\u2019t win a game in March, and now won\u2019t play in April, May, June, July, August, September, October or November. The Pistons\u2019 last win was Feb. 28. The rough \u2014 very rough \u2014 draft of the NBA calendar suggests next season will start Dec. 1. That\u2019s almost nine full months without games. Meanwhile, the 2020 NBA finalists aren\u2019t even slated to get nine weeks off before next season starts. And every team will have to cram a draft and free agency into very small windows next fall. For Detroit, Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, Charlotte, Minnesota and Golden State, it\u2019ll be a long break. The Warriors\u2019 Klay Thompson last played a year ago, when he tore his ACL in the NBA Finals. He\u2019s basically going to go a year and a half without playing a real game. (The same could be the case for Kevin Durant, if he doesn\u2019t return to Brooklyn\u2019s lineup when the season resumes.) \u201cThis certainly wasn\u2019t how we hoped our season would come to an end, and it\u2019s fair to say that we are disappointed that our young team will not be allowed to gain more valuable time playing together by being included in the restart of the season,\u201d Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk and coach Lloyd Pierce said in a joint statement Friday. There\u2019s a lot of teams feeling that same way. The very long wait for the eight teams not going to Disney and the very short offseason for the teams that go deep into the playoffs are Disney are not the only schedule issue on the table right now. If the NBA goes forward with a normal regular season in 2020-21, a Dec. 1 start date means the playoffs wouldn\u2019t start until late May and could reach into late July. And that calls into question whether NBA players could take part in the Olympics, which has qualifying scheduled for June 2021 for the final four spots in the men\u2019s field and then the Tokyo Games themselves beginning on July 23, 2021. USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo has said the Americans will wait and see what the NBA schedule really is before reacting and setting a firm plan for picking a team for Tokyo next summer. But for the players who play deep into this season, then play deep into next season, that\u2019s a lot of basketball without a lot of time off. And that could make the job of picking an Olympic team much tougher than usual."},{"id":27472,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nbpa-approves-further-negotiations-season-restart","date":"2020-06-05","title":"NBPA approves further negotiations with NBA on 22-team format for season restart","content":"NEW YORK, NY \u2013 The Board of Player Representatives of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) has approved further negotiations with the NBA on a 22-team return to play scenario to restart the 2019-20 NBA season.

All teams will stay, practice and play at Disney and the NBA Finals \u2014 which would have started Thursday if not for the coronavirus pandemic that caused the NBA to suspend its season on March 11 \u2014 will likely stretch into October. \u201cThe Board\u2019s approval of the restart format is a necessary step toward resuming the NBA season,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cWhile the COVID-19 pandemic presents formidable challenges, we are hopeful of finishing the season in a safe and responsible manner based on strict protocols now being finalized with public health officials and medical experts.\u201d The eight-game slate \u2014 it\u2019s unclear if they will be classified as regular season games \u2014 will help determine playoff seeding. From there, the league could have a play-in tournament for the final spot in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference postseason fields. \u201cWhile there is still work to be done, we applaud all the effort and collaboration that has gone into finding a safe, competitive format,\u201d Orlando Magic CEO Alex Martins said. \u201cIt has always been our feeling that sports have the ability to bring people together and we look forward to restarting the NBA season while using that platform to drive meaningful social impact at this period of time.\u201d There are numerous other details to continue working through, including finalizing specifics of what the testing plan at Disney will entail and calculating the financial ramifications of playing fewer games. Another person, also speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because the details of the ongoing talks have not been publicly released, said the NBPA and the NBA are working on \u201clengthy\u201d medical protocols. The details will be shared with teams once those discussions are completed, which will be long before they arrive at Disney, the person said. \u201cThe NBA is taking all the appropriate measures, and working tirelessly to provide a safe environment for our team and staff,\u201d the Dallas Mavericks said in statement. While working to finish this season, the league also has made decisions on next season \u2014 with the draft lottery rescheduled for Aug. 25, the draft on Oct. 15 and opening night for the 2020-21 campaign is tentatively set for Dec. 1. The G League also announced Thursday that it canceled the remainder of this season. The 22 Disney-bound clubs would play somewhere between 71 and 75 games before the playoffs begin, down from the customary 82-game slate. The teams who didn\u2019t qualify for the restart will see their seasons end after having played somewhere between 64 and 67 games. Roughly 15% of what would have been the full NBA regular season won\u2019t be played, which means players stand to lose around $600 million in salary. How that process will work is among the issues that the league and union are still working to solve. But one of the biggest hurdles is now cleared, in an NBA season like none other. The league is planning for the same playoff rules as usual, that being every round utilizing a best-of-seven format. The 22-team plan includes all teams that were holding playoff spots when the season was stopped, plus all other clubs within six games of a berth. Milwaukee, the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston and reigning NBA champion Toronto had already clinched playoff berths. Now with only eight games remaining for each team, it means that eight other clubs \u2014 Miami, Indiana, Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston \u2014 have postseason spots secured, and Dallas virtually has one as well. That leaves nine teams vying for three remaining playoff berths. In the East, Brooklyn, Orlando and Washington are in the race for two spots. In the West, Memphis, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix will jostle for one spot. If the gap between eighth place and ninth place in either conference is four games or less when the eight-game slate ends, those teams will play off for the No. 8 seed. The team in ninth place would have to go 2-0 in a two-game series to advance. \u201cThere is still much work to be done, but we are excited to be able to return to the court,\u201d Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard said. For Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, Golden State, Minnesota, Detroit, Chicago and Charlotte, the season is over. The Knicks will miss the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season, the third-longest current drought in the league behind Sacramento and Phoenix \u2014 who still have chances of getting into the playoffs this season. \u201cWhile we are disappointed for our team and our fans that our season is coming to an end, we understand and accept the league\u2019s plan to move forward with 22 teams,\u201d Timberwolves President Gersson Rosas said. \u201cIt is important that we be a good teammate not only to the NBA, but to the other 29 teams to support the efforts to complete this season and prepare for next season in a healthy and safe manner.\u201d And with the Hawks done, it also means Vince Carter has likely played the final game of his 22-year NBA career \u2014 the longest in league history. Carter, the first player in NBA history to appear in four different decades, plans to retire. He appeared in 1,541 NBA games, behind only Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) on the all-time list."},{"id":27561,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-season-restart-edition","date":"2020-06-05","title":"Hang Time Podcast: An NBA.com Roundtable","content":"NBA.com senior writers Shaun Powell, Michael C.

But commissioner Adam Silver, admitting a mixed sporting metaphor, heeded caution. \u201cWe\u2019re in the equivalent of the first inning,\u201d Silver said during his remote appearance on a special edition of TNT\u2019s \u201cInside The NBA\u201d. The league went dark on March 11 due to fears of the coronavirus pandemic that was accelerating though regions of the country. About 15 percent of the regular season remained. At this point, two top contenders would normally be in the midst of the NBA Finals, but the balls haven\u2019t bounced in nearly three months. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking for a very appropriate and safe way we can resume playing basketball,\u201d Silver said, \u201cknowing we will be living with this virus for a while. \u2026 We\u2019re exploring with the players whether there can be a \u2018new normal\u2019 here.\u201d Silver also talked at length about the protests against police brutality playing out across the nation in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing by the Minneapolis Police Department on May 25. As the four officers involved were terminated and subsequently arrested, citizens have risen together, exposing raw emotions and challenging the public and political leadership. As a league filled with powerful, highly visible African-American athletes, NBA voices have been at the forefront of these ongoing cultural conversations. \u201cThere are no doubt law enforcement issues,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut ultimately it\u2019s about race and race in America. We are such a unique institution \u2026 that ultimately may be in position to have more of an impact on this issue than almost any other organization in the world.\u201d Earlier Thursday, the league\u2019s Board of Governors approved the format in which the 2019-20 season likely will resume, with a tentative start date of July 31. All games are expected to be played at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, with limited persons in attendance to maintain COVID-19 pandemic precautions. What the NBA settled on is a pool of 22 teams \u2013 the 16 teams that were in position for playoff berths when the season paused on March 11, plus six more that were within six games of the eighth seed in their respective conferences. In taking the clubs with the 22 best records, the group that will resume play will include five extra Western Conference teams (Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix) and one from the East (Washington). All teams will play eight \u201cseeding games\u201d in a span of 16 days, with the possibility of a play-in tournament for the final playoff spot in each conference. If the No. 8 team is more than four games ahead of the No. 9 team, it advances directly to the playoffs with the conference\u2019s top seven. If the gap is four games or fewer, a play-in mechanism will trigger: the No. 8 team would have to beat No. 9 once, or No. 9 would need to win twice. The tentative calendar discussed Thursday looks like this: On June 30, teams that have been dormant for more than three months will open training camps at their local facilities. They will travel to the ESPN World Wide of Sports complex in Orlando on or around July 7. All 22 teams will be headquartered at Disney for the duration of its participation. The playoffs will proceed as usual \u2013 four rounds of best-of-seven series \u2013 with a possible Game 7 in the Finals played on Oct. 12. Silver credited NBA legend and current Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan with pushing for a traditional playoff bracket. \u201cHe felt it was very important that after we established the 16 teams that we not get gimmicky,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much chaos in the world right now, let\u2019s come as close to normal as we can.\u201d Other notable NBA dates have been shifted as well: The annual Draft Lottery will take place on Aug. 25, the NBA Draft will be Oct. 15 and free agency will open on Oct. 18. Dates for the opening of the 2020-21 season also are suggestions for now: Training camps would open Nov. 10, with a targeted Opening Night of Dec. 1. Silver referred to the approval of the restart format as a \u201cnecessary step,\u201d but hardly the only one. Financial considerations are driving the return, but the health and safety of players, coaches, staff and others in the league\u2019s extended family is essential. \u201cWhile the COVID-19 pandemic presents formidable challenges,\u201d the commissioner said in a statement, \u201cwe are hopeful of finishing the season in a safe and responsible manner based on strict protocols now being finalized with public health officials and medical experts.\u201d Still to be determined: testing details and procedures for if or when a player tests positive for the coronavirus. A report in The Athletic identified the Portland Trail Blazers as the only team that voted against the 22-team format. The Blazers \u2013 who at 29-37 sit three games behind No. 8 Memphis and thus are included \u2013 reportedly preferred an alternative format. The National Basketball Players Association is scheduled to vote on the plan Friday, according to the Associated Press. Logistics of broadcast coverage, including game announcers, and media coverage by print and Internet outlets still are not known. Silver said the first hour of the Board of Governors meeting was spent talking about the Floyd incident and its aftermath. He called on players, coaches, former players and the owners \u2013 quoting NBPA executive director Michele Roberts, with whom he spoke Thursday \u2013 to go above and beyond joint statements now in trying to find some solutions. \u201cLet\u2019s collectively put our heads together,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThis is a moment in time.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen I think about who we are, the resources we have available to us, the footprint of this league, the list of [players and others] \u2026 I think we can have an enormous impact on society. \u201cWe\u2019re not a political organization, but we\u2019re an organization steeped in values.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Board\u2019s approval is the first formal step among many required to resume the season. The NBA is working to finalize a comprehensive season restart plan with the National Basketball Players Association. The NBA and the NBPA are working with infectious disease specialists, public health experts and government officials to establish a rigorous program to prevent and mitigate the risk related to COVID-19, including a regular testing protocol and stringent safety practices. The season restart is also contingent on an agreement with The Walt Disney Company to use Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida, as a single site for a campus for all games, practices and housing for the remainder of the season. Based on the competitive format that the NBA Board of Governors approved today, the 22 returning teams would be the 16 teams (eight per conference) in current playoff positions and the six teams that are currently six games or fewer behind the eighth seed in their respective conferences. Those two groups comprise teams with the NBA\u2019s 22 best records.  \u201cThe Board\u2019s approval of the restart format is a necessary step toward resuming the NBA season,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cWhile the COVID-19 pandemic presents formidable challenges, we are hopeful of finishing the season in a safe and responsible manner based on strict protocols now being finalized with public health officials and medical experts. We also recognize that as we prepare to resume play, our society is reeling from recent tragedies of racial violence and injustice, and we will continue to work closely with our teams and players to use our collective resources and influence to address these issues in very real and concrete ways.\u201d The season restart would begin with eight \u201cseeding games\u201d for each returning team and include the possibility of a play-in tournament for the eighth and final playoff seed in each conference depending on combined records across regular-season games and seeding games. Once the 16-team playoff field is set, the NBA Playoffs would proceed in a traditional conference-based format with four rounds and best-of-seven series in each round. The NBA Finals would end no later than Oct. 12. (See below for the list of returning teams and additional details.)  If, as tentatively scheduled, the season resumes on July 30, then the 2020 NBA Draft Lottery would be rescheduled for Aug. 25, the 2020 NBA Draft would be held on Oct. 16 and the 2020-21 NBA regular season would likely begin on Dec. 1, 2020. The 14 NBA Lottery teams would be the eight teams that do not participate in the restart and the six teams that participate in the restart but do not qualify for the playoffs. These teams would be seeded in the lottery and assigned odds based on their records through games of March 11. The 16 playoff teams would draft in inverse order of their combined records across regular-season games and seeding games. NBA Season Restart: Competitive Format Plan The 22 returning teams for the season restart would be the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Brooklyn Nets, Orlando Magic and Washington Wizards from the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings, San Antonio Spurs and Phoenix Suns from the Western Conference.  Each returning team would play eight seeding games, as selected from its remaining regular-season matchups. At the conclusion of the seeding games, the seven teams in each conference with the best combined records across regular-season games and seeding games would qualify for the playoffs. If the team with the eighth-best combined record in its conference is more than four games ahead of the team with the ninth-best combined record in the same conference, then the team with the eighth-best record would earn the eighth playoff seed. If the team with the eighth-best combined record in its conference (Team A) is four games or fewer ahead of the team with the ninth-best combined record in the same conference (Team B), then Teams A and B would compete in a play-in tournament to determine the eighth playoff seed. To earn the eighth playoff seed, Team A would need to defeat Team B once and Team B would need to defeat Team A two games in a row. The 2019-20 season would conclude with a traditional playoff format with best-of-seven series in the first round, conference semifinals, conference finals and the NBA Finals.

The teams that will be going to the ESPN Wide World Of Sports complex on the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida would play eight games to determine playoff seeding starting around July 31 before the postseason begins, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Wednesday because the league has not released its proposal publicly. The plan, if approved, would have 13 Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams going to Disney and the cutoff being that teams must be within six games of a playoff spot at this point. Playoffs would start in August, and the NBA Finals will likely stretch into October, the person said. The Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics already have clinched playoff spots \u2014 and, if only eight games are left, that would mean the Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets would theoretically have clinched spots as well. * Current NBA standings The Dallas Mavericks would be virtually assured of clinching a West spot, holding a seven-game lead over eighth-place Memphis. So that would mean the Grizzlies, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix all would be in the running for the No. 8 seed out West. In the East, Washington is six games behind No. 7 Brooklyn and 5-1\/2 games behind No. 8 Orlando \u2014 so within range of triggering a play-in series. \u201cI\u2019m all in from the state\u2019s perspective,\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference in Central Florida on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could find a better place than Orlando to do this. I think it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d DeSantis met by phone with NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum on Tuesday. The governor also said the state helped with the plans to make a golf match last month featuring Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning \u2014 one that raised $20 million for coronavirus relief \u2014 happen. And Major League Soccer announced Wednesday a plan to restart its season in Orlando. \u201cOrlando really could be the epicenter of the comeback of professional sports,\u201d DeSantis said. For a play-in series to happen to determine the No. 8 seed on either playoff bracket, the ninth-place team would have to be within four games of eighth place. If a play-in series occurs, it would basically be a best-of-two \u2014 where the No. 9 seed would have to win two head-to-head matchups to take over the No. 8 spot. There would also be some jostling for playoff positioning happening in the eight-game restart. In the East, Toronto and Boston are separated by three games for the No. 2 spot and Miami, Indiana and Philadelphia are separated by two games for the No. 4 spot. Out West, the Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston are all within four games of one another in the race for the No. 2 seed on that bracket. There are still some elements of the restart plan that could be changed, and other matters are still being negotiated \u2014 such as how much of a percentage of their salaries that players will lose because some regular season games will be canceled. If 15% of the regular season is not played, which would be the current estimate based on the proposal, players would have to give up roughly $610 million in salary for this season. It\u2019s also unclear what will happen to the eight teams that would not be vying for a postseason berth under the proposed format \u2014 Charlotte, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, New York, Cleveland, Minnesota and Golden State. If the 2020-21 NBA season doesn\u2019t start until December at the earliest, which would seem to be a very real possibility, those teams could go about nine months without playing games and some have expressed concerns over what that will mean for player development. The NBA suspended its season March 11, becoming the first of the U.S. major pro leagues to do so after it became known that Utah\u2019s All-Star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 \u2014 not all were identified \u2014 and Commissioner Adam Silver said that the actual total was even higher. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a 255-acre campus with multiple arenas that could host games simultaneously and has been home to, among other things, the Jr. NBA World Championship in recent years. ESPN is primarily owned by Disney, one of the NBA\u2019s broadcast partners."},{"id":27575,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/schuhmann-film-study-boston-celtics","date":"2020-06-03","title":"Film Study: How Celtics create offense without ball movement","content":" Beautiful ball movement makes us happy. The way the San Antonio Spurs played in the 2014 Finals may have been the most enjoyable performance from a single team in a series that we\u2019ve ever seen. The whole was greater than the sum of the parts and the Spurs\u2019 passing chewed up the Miami Heat\u2019s aggressive pick-and-roll defense. But these days, few teams defend pick-and-rolls like those Heat did. And while ball movement remains aesthetically pleasing, it doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to consistently good offense. Players generally shoot better off the catch than they do off the dribble, but the correlation between assist percentage (the percentage of a team\u2019s field goals that are assisted) and offensive efficiency is actually negative. Same with the correlation between overall ball movement (passes per 24 minutes of possession) and offensive efficiency. This season, only one top-10 offense (that of the Denver Nuggets) ranks in the top 10 in ball movement, according to Second Spectrum tracking. The league\u2019s three most efficient offenses \u2013 those of the Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets and LA Clippers \u2013 rank 20th (322), 29th (293) and 26th (315) in passes per 24 minutes of possession, respectively. The league\u2019s 30th ranked offense \u2013 that of the Golden State Warriors \u2013 ranks first (389). Talent obviously matters. Last season\u2019s Warriors ranked first in both ball movement and offensive efficiency. But even then, with the pass-happy Warriors fully loaded, there was no correlation between ball movement and efficiency. Last season, the Boston Celtics ranked seventh in ball movement (354). This season, they rank 18th (325), having seen the league\u2019s seventh biggest drop in passes per 24 minutes of possession. The Celtics have seen the league\u2019s second biggest drop in assist percentage, from 62.4% ( eighth ) last season to 55.4% ( 25th ) this season. The last time Boston ranked in the bottom 10 in assist percentage was 20 years ago . But entering the league\u2019s hiatus, the Celtics were fifth in offensive efficiency, their highest ranking in seven seasons under head coach Brad Stevens. Improvement has come on the glass \u2013 the Celtics have seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in offensive rebounding percentage, from 25.7% ( 24th ) last season to 28.4% ( eighth ) this season \u2013 and in their ability to get to the line. And when you don\u2019t move the ball that much, it helps to shoot well off the dribble. The Celtics lead the league in pull-up effective field goal percentage (49.0%), with four of the 25 players that have an effective field goal percentage of 50% or better on at least 100 pull-up jumpers. Marcus Smart, who had an effective field goal percentage of 39% on pull-up jumpers over the previous three seasons, may be the most surprising name on that list of 25 players, especially considering that he ranks fourth (!) in pull-up effective field goal percentage at 53.8%. Smart remains a wildcard in the Celtics\u2019 offense, sometimes a little too eager to let it fly. But the Celtics have two more consistent vets, as well as a young star who has obviously taken a big step forward. And if Smart\u2019s improvement can be sustained, the Celtics have a lot of weapons off the dribble. Kemba Walker has an effective field goal percentage of 51.5% on pull-up jumpers, 12th among the 139 players who have attempted at least 100 and up from 50.4% over his previous three seasons. He\u2019s been remarkably consistent in that regard ( 49.9% , 50.5% , 50.8% , 51.5%). According to Synergy, Walker ranks ninth in the league with 10.1 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game. One of the actions the Celtics run for him several times a game is a double-drag screen, where Walker brings the ball up one side of the floor (usually the left side, so he can attack with his right-hand dribble) and two teammates set staggered screens to free him for a shot or a drive. The first screen, set further from the basket, is usually set by a wing. The second, closer to the 3-point line, is usually set by a big. That puts two different kinds of defenders in a switch, hedge or drop situation. Defending it well requires good communication from all three defenders involved. Both screens are typically set at a 45-degree angle. Play 1. Gordon Hayward sets the initial screen 35 feet from the basket, but Fred VanVleet ( bringer of pressure ) goes over the screen and doesn\u2019t even get to Daniel Theis\u2019 second screen by the time Walker is rising for a pull-up 3-pointer with Serge Ibaka in no position to contest. Number to know: Walker has scored 1.08 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, the third best mark among 49 players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. Play 2. Utah\u2019s Tony Bradley comes up to meet Walker after the second screen, with Joe Ingles trailing. Walker stumbles a little, but still gets by Bradley for a tough layup. Number to know: Walker has shot 55.8% in the restricted area, a mark which ranks 126th among 145 players with at least 150 restricted-area attempts. Play 3. Once again, Walker\u2019s defender (Aaron Holiday) goes over the first screen, despite how far it\u2019s set from the basket. Instead of using the second screen, Walker steps into another pull-up 3-pointer, with neither Hayward\u2019s defender (Victor Oladipo) nor Theis\u2019 defender (Myles Turner) alert enough to step up and contest it. Number to know: 69% of Walker\u2019s pull-up jumpers have been 3-point attempts. That\u2019s the eighth highest rate among 139 players who have attempted at least 100 pull-up jumpers total. Play 4. Jeff Teague \u201cices\u201d the double-drag, meaning that he gets between the ball-handler and the screener to force the ball in the other direction. So Grant Williams flips his screen and Walker goes left. John Collins is more alert than some of the previous defenders, but Walker is able to launch from a few feet beyond the 3-point line. Number to know: Walker has shot 36.4% on pull-up 3-pointers, the fourth best mark among 18 players who have attempted at least 200. Play 5. Like Teague, Ja Morant ices the first screen. This time, Walker doesn\u2019t wait for Hayward to flip it. Instead, he quickly rejects the screen and draws help from Hayward\u2019s man (Jaren Jackson Jr.), leaving Hayward open for a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer. Number to know: The Celtics have scored 116.0 points per 100 possessions with Walker on the floor. That\u2019s the sixth highest on-court OffRtg mark among 265 players who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 40 games or more. Jayson Tatum ranks eighth in the league with 3.5 isolation possessions per game, according to Synergy. And often, he gets to those isolations via a ball screen. Play 1. Smart sets a screen along the right sideline and the Jazz switch it without a fight. Smart clears out so Tatum can go one-on-one against Jordan Clarkson. Donovan Mitchell leaves Smart and hangs out on the strong side of the floor, but Tatum gets into the paint and lofts a floater over both defenders. Number to know: Tatum has scored 0.99 points per possession on isolations, the eighth best mark among 22 players who have averaged at least 2.5 isolation possessions per game. Play 2. Tatum catches at the left elbow and gets a screen from Theis. Anthony Davis switches onto Tatum and Tatum goes to a side-step to his right, draining a 3-pointer over one of the league\u2019s rangiest defenders. Number to know: Tatum has shot 39.9% on pull-up 3-pointers, the second best mark among 18 players who have attempted at least 200. Play 3. Walker sets an early ball screen for Tatum, so that Tatum is now defended by Landry Shamet instead of Kawhi Leonard (a little bit of a difference there). Tatum backs Shamet down to the block and squeezes around Montrezl Harrell\u2019s double-team. Tatum would treat Shamet a little more harshly in isolation (via a transition mismatch) later in the same game. Number to know: Tatum has shot just 59.3% in the restricted area, down from 63.1% last season and the 20th worst mark among 89 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. Play 4. Another early screen (from Brad Wanamaker) gets Tatum matched up with Trae Young. He eventually gets triple-teamed and hits Wanamaker for an open 3-pointer. Number to know: Tatum has recorded assists on just 11.3% of his possessions, the third lowest rate among 40 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. Hayward ranks third in the Celtics with 4.3 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game. He hasn\u2019t been as efficient as Walker or Tatum (or even Smart) as a ball-handler, because most of his shots off the dribble have come from inside the arc. While 3-pointers account for 69% and 55% of Walker\u2019s and Tatum\u2019s pull-up jumpers respectively, only 26% of Hayward\u2019s pull-up jumpers have been 3-pointers. But, given how most defenses defend pick-and-rolls, there are times when mid-range proficiency is needed. And Hayward has been one of the best mid-range shooters in the league. Play 1. Theis sets a transition drag screen for Hayward and the Pacers\u2019 two bigs aren\u2019t really used to defending pick-and-rolls together. Domantas Sabonis initially stays with Theis, Turner doesn\u2019t know what to do, and Hayward takes advantage. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum, Hayward has shot 82-for-153 (53.6%) on pull-up 2-pointers, the third best mark among 95 players who have attempted at least 100. The only players with better marks are Chris Paul (54.9%) and Khris Middleton (53.8%). Play 2. On a sideline out of bounds play, Smart sets a pin-down for Hayward out of the left corner and into a dribble-handoff from Theis. The Pacers now have a more capable perimeter defender on Hayward, but after Victor Oladipo goes under the second screen, Hayward puts on the breaks and Oladipo flies by, unable to contest the jumper. Number to know: Hayward\u2019s effective field goal percentage on pull-up jumpers (51.7%) ranks ninth among the 139 players who have attempted at least 100 and is up from 45.0% over his last three full seasons. Play 3. Luguentz Dort appears to blow up the intended action for Walker. So Hayward comes out of the corner for another handoff from Theis, who then flips the screen. With Shai Gilgeous-Alexander trailing and Steven Adams wary of Theis\u2019 roll to the rim, Hayward is able to get to an open spot and drain another mid-range jumper. Number to know: Hayward has shot 64-for-130 (49.2%) between the paint and the 3-point line, the seventh best mark among 79 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts. Play 4. Enes Kanter enters to Hayward at the left elbow, sets a ball screen, and quickly rolls to the rim, keeping Davis occupied. Hayward gets a half step on Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and again displays his ability to put on the breaks and rise up for a comfortable jumper before KCP can gather himself. Number to know: As a team, the Celtics have scored 0.98 points per possession, the league\u2019s second best mark , on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions. Play 5. Hayward doesn\u2019t always settle for the mid-range. Here he rejects Tatum\u2019s screen, catches Kelan Martin leaning, and gets to the basket Number to know: Hayward has shot 68.9% in the restricted area, the best mark of his career and up from 60.4% through his first nine seasons in the league. Theis has averaged 6.2 screen assists per 36 minutes, the seventh highest mark among 228 players who have played at least 1,000 minutes total. But Theis\u2019 most effective screens aren\u2019t the ones he sets 25 feet from the basket. The third-year big is a master of screening his own man, allowing his teammate to get to the rim untouched. In some circles, this type of screen is called a \u201cGortat,\u201d with John Wall having been the beneficiary of countless own-man screens from Wizards teammate and one-time screen-assist leader Marcin Gortat. Tatum has been the been the biggest beneficiary of Theis\u2019 Gortats. He\u2019s figured out how to come off Theis\u2019 initial screen, \u201csnake\u201d in the other direction to keep his own defender behind him, and hesitate just enough to allow Theis to roll to the rim and set another screen on the defender protecting the rim. Play 1. Theis swings the ball to Tatum and follows it to set a screen for Tatum, going left. CJ McCollum goes over the screen and Tatum keeps him on his hip, crossing over to his right. Theis rolls down the right side of the lane and holds off Hassan Whiteside, allowing Tatum to get all the way to the rim. Number to know: Tatum has taken 68% of his shots , the highest rate in his three seasons, from the restricted area or 3-point range. But that\u2019s mostly about exchanging some mid-range shots (27% of his shots last season , 16% this season) for 3-point attempts ( 30%, 38% ). Play 2. This time, they\u2019re going in the other direction. Tatum gets Trevor Ariza on his hip and Theis rolls down the middle of the lane as Tatum crosses from right to left. Another screen on Whiteside gets Tatum to the cup. Number to know: The Celtics rank 19th offensively in the first half of games (108.9 points scored per 100 possessions), but first in the second half (116.2). That\u2019s the biggest jump in offensive efficiency from the first half to the second half this season. Play 3. Again, it\u2019s right to left, though this time, the victims are two Defensive Player of the Year candidates, and Tatum puts the ball back in his right hand for the finish. Number to know: The Celtics have seen the league\u2019s third biggest jump in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area, from 28.7% (27th) last season to 32.5% (15th) this season. Play 4. Smart is the ball-handler, but the Gortat doesn\u2019t produce a layup, because Oladipo anticipates Theis\u2019 second screen and leaves his man to protect the rim. Smart sees the late help and finds Hayward for the wide-open corner 3-pointer. Number to know: Only 56% of the Celtics\u2019 3-point attempts, the league\u2019s lowest rate, have been catch-and-shoot attempts. Play 5. We\u2019ve come full circle, back to the double-drag for Walker. With Rodney McGruder caught in Wanamaker\u2019s initial screen and Lou Williams way out of position, Walker turns the corner and Kanter rolls to the rim, getting in the way of Harrell, who still fouls Walker as he scores at the rim. Number to know: The Celtics have seen the league\u2019s second biggest increase in free throw rate (FTA\/FGA), from 0.215 ( 30th ) last season to 0.255 ( 18th ) this season. Likely to remain the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics may be a sleeping giant. They\u2019re currently the only East team that ranks in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency, and they\u2019re tied with the Lakers for the fewest losses (five) that weren\u2019t within five points in the last five minutes. In 22 games against the league\u2019s top 10 defenses , the Celtics have scored 111.4 points scored per 100 possessions. Only Portland has been more efficient against that group, and just by a hair: 111.38 vs. 111.37 per 100. The Celtics are 11-11 in those games and have had the best defense (106.0 points allowed per 100 possessions in 17 games) against the league\u2019s top 10 offenses . Against the best defenses and in the playoffs, you need guys that can get you buckets off the dribble. The Celtics\u2019 offense isn\u2019t complicated, but it\u2019s effective, and it can come from several different places. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.
