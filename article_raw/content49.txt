Will they get the reset right this time? That\u2019s up to new basketball ops chief Jeff Weltman and new GM John Hammond, the surgical team busy checking the body for any parts worth salvaging as they move forward. It\u2019s time, again, to develop the young and steer away from moves that\u2019ll put the future in jeopardy or cause the team to take a step backward. Perhaps more than most in the NBA, the Magic lack the identity and pop needed to carve a nice niche and begin rising in the league\u2019s pecking order. What\u2019s especially disturbing is they haven\u2019t made up much ground, if any, since separating themselves from Dwight Howard , their last meaningful franchise piece and link to the good times.  It\u2019s almost six years now and there\u2019s no All-Star or apparent young beast in the making on the roster, or anyone who\u2019ll make a trade feel like a franchise-changing blockbuster. Those are the tools needed to roust confidence in the blueprint and convince folks the club is on the up-and-up. That\u2019s the challenge this season, to once and for all put something in place that gets traction and makes a solid impression. Hammond is a seasoned basketball guy with successful stops in Detroit and Milwaukee. Weltman was the right-hand man of the respected Masai Ujiri in Toronto and Denver. They put the Magic in experienced hands. The catch, though, is the new guys need patience and time, too. For now, the Magic own the award for surprise of the early season, after they beat the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road by 21 on Saturday and, for a fleeting moment, gave their fans the hazy memory of when Orlando, not Cleveland, was the kingpin of the conference . But after those peak Howard years and great returns, the Magic failed to upgrade the talent around him. Howard and ex-coach Stan Van Gundy had their fallout , then the Magic lost both of them, and now this. This would normally all be OK (because every good run eventually comes to an end), yet the Magic have lost a half-decade under former GM Rob Hennigan. Essentially, the Magic are starting over. Again. When the new regime arrived last spring and conducted an in-house inspection, they saw what everyone knew, that this would be no quick fix. \u201cJeff and I both liked players on the roster,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cWe realized we had players who had value to us and value around the league. We understand it\u2019s going to take some time. Do we want to win today? Of course. But not doing so at the sacrifice of the future. We want to make sure, as we try to build this, we build something that can sustain winning and reach the goal of playing for a championship.\u201d While Hammond and Weltman liked the roster enough to refrain from wholesale changes right away, their actions spoke louder: There were no contract extensions at the deadline for Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton, a pair of 23-and-unders who normally would inspire confidence as former top-10 picks. To be fair, only fellow 2014 first-round picks Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid and Gary Harris snagged extensions. It makes sense for the Magic to wait, protect their salary-cap room and reassess next summer when the two hit restricted free agency and get a better idea of their true value. Payton hasn\u2019t shown enough consistency as a shooter or playmaker to be the long-term answer at point guard, and the bigger surprise is Gordon, an immensely-gifted athlete who\u2019s still working on being an immensely gifted basketball player. Gordon isn\u2019t a volume scorer or rebounder, but has done just enough of both in his three years to keep planting hope that he\u2019ll be more than just the best Slam Dunk Contest runner-up we\u2019ve ever seen. With Gordon, the questions are many. Is he a power forward or small forward? Is he a classic \u2018tweener? Can he ever average 20 points despite a 29.7 percent career mark on 3-pointers? Gordon was helped by the in-season trade of Serge Ibaka in 2016-17 and, for now, is fitting at power forward with solid production so far . \u201cHe\u2019s an improved player,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cEvery player should have the goal to come back better every year. Players should come back and improve at least one area of their game. Sometimes it\u2019s a major and sometimes it\u2019s not. One thing Aaron has done is improve his improvement shooting and his range. He has the ability to be a very good player. He\u2019s already a premier athlete in this league. To play above the rim, speed and quickness, he has those God-given traits and his skills are improving.\u201d That\u2019s really what Weltman, Hammond and coach Frank Vogel will do this season: See who\u2019s staying and who\u2019s going among the young core, and how much veteran carryover from the last regime is worth salvaging. One in particular is rim protector Bismack Biyombo, a desperation signing by Hennigan two summers ago with a cap-clogging four-year, $17-million-a-season deal . Orlando rolled the dice on Biyombo, thinking his 2015-16 season and playoff performances were career-changers . Instead, Biyombo has failed to duplicate that in Orlando so far.  On the flip side of the economic divide is Jonathon Simmons, an energy guy poached from the San Antonio Spurs this summer at a very reasonable $18 million over three years, proof that Weltman and Hammond are careful not to threaten their most valuable resource: Future cap room. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to have patience in trying to make some decisions,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cWe don\u2019t overreact. If an opportunity presents itself, or opens today and in the future, we look at it. Right now, it\u2019s the time for us to have patience and try to learn as much as you can about your team first.\u201d The real goal is to nail the high No. 1 picks that will likely be coming Orlando\u2019s way, or any pick for that matter. Hammond was in Milwaukee when the Bucks took Giannis Antetokounmpo with the 15th pick, and as we\u2019ve see, the correct call in the Draft (and a bit of luck) can make all the difference. \u201cI would be disingenuous if we knew he would be this type of player,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cHe\u2019s got extremely high character, and he works extremely hard and he\u2019s got great gifts. You put all those three together and that\u2019s the formula for success. Milwaukee is excited about him and the team is in position to move forward.\u201d It\u2019s far too early to tell if Hammonds\u2019 first draft decision in Orlando will fall anywhere in that same zip code, though he\u2019s high on Jonathan Isaac who\u2019s just 20 and brings the same length and basketball instincts. The immediate issue is Isaac getting enough playing time on a front line with Simmons and Gordon and touches with Evan Fournier and Nikola Vucevic; other lottery picks don\u2019t have that problem. \u201cHis strength is going to be an issue early in this first season, but he does have a good feel for the game,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cHe knows how to play, can handle it, can pass it, can shoot it some. You can put him on the floor without hurting your team. Frank has shown that confidence in him.\u201d The NBA team that owes its history to being lucky in the draft lottery needs a repeat of that, along with some front office skill, to recharge a franchise that\u2019s fallen off radar. Since leaving the Magic, Dwight Howard has changed teams four times, roughly matching the number of Magic rebuilds. Coincidence, no?

What impresses you most about the Sixers\u2019 Ben Simmons?  * * * David Aldridge :  He plays at his own speed. He\u2019s never rushed. And because of that, he can get to his skill set in the flow of an offense, rather than rushing to it. He\u2019s got amazing quickness in traffic; that first step seems to get him into the paint in an instant. Now, eventually, teams will pack it in and make him consistently make jumpers, and that\u2019s where he\u2019ll have to show he\u2019s capable. But what a beginning. May God give us four or five years of uninterrupted Simmons-Joel Embiid goodness. Steve Aschburner : What I find most intriguing about Simmons is, he\u2019s a legitimate 6-foot-10 and he\u2019s playing a true point guard, not just a point-forward variation. We\u2019ve been waiting a long, long time for Magic Johnson\u2019s baton to be handed off in full \u2014 remember how we allegedly were going to get a parade of 6-foot-8 and 6-foot-9 playmakers? \u2014 yet we essentially had to settle for Jalen Rose and, er, crickets. It obviously is taking time for Simmons\u2019 individual game to translate into team success but he\u2019s off to a terrific, Rookie of the Year-type start. Shaun Powell :  Yes, he brings the necessary goods to rack up the stats and help in multiple ways. Yet, Simmons most impressively is a cool customer. I\u2019ve never seen him rattled or bothered by the moment (so far). He\u2019s comfortable with the ball everywhere except beyond the arc and perhaps in time he\u2019ll be OK there as well. The next test will come when he has a bad stretch or hits the rookie wall; how will he respond? You find out a lot about a person during tough times. Anyway, the long wait caused by a lost rookie season has made him anxious and eager to prove he belongs. Well, he does. John Schuhmann : Being a 6-foot-10 point guard is certainly unique. But it goes beyond that, because he has a great feel for the game. Along with his great vision, he plays in control and at the right speed, which is special for a rookie. And from what I\u2019ve seen, he\u2019s not a liability on defense, which is really special for a rookie.  Sekou Smith : The triple-double this early into his playing career is impressive enough, but it\u2019s the ease Simmons is operating with right now that\u2019s perhaps most impressive. He is clearly temperamentally fit for the role he\u2019s being asked to play in \u201cThe Process.\u201d Sure, he had a redshirt year. And doesn\u2019t every rookie wish he had a paid first-year internship to get ready for life in the NBA? Simmons, however, seems to have used his observation season to figure out exactly how his skill set could best serve the young Sixers\u2019 journey from the lottery to their goal of becoming a playoff player in the Eastern Conference. They still have a ways to go. But with Simmons and Joel Embiid, two physical specimens at their respective positions locked in as your cornerstones, the future in Philly is indeed bright."},{"id":43541,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-surprised-dwyane-wade-move-bench-3-games-season","date":"2017-10-25","title":"Blogtable: Are you surprised by Dwyane Wade's move to the bench?","content":"* * * The Cavs have moved J.R. Smith back into the starting lineup , with Dwyane Wade coming off the bench. Are you surprised by this move, just three games into the season?  * * * David Aldridge :  No. They couldn\u2019t run the risk of losing Smith; he was brooding over getting benched, and not without some justification. More importantly, Wade and Derrick Rose (pre-ankle injury) simply was not going to work long-term playing off of LeBron James. He needs multiple shooters on the floor to maximize his impact. Smith, at this stage, is just a better perimeter shooter than Wade. And Wade could stand to have his minutes cut back at this point in his career, anyway. Right move. Steve Aschburner : Wade should have been appointed captain of the Cavs bench upon his arrival. What with Kevin Love getting mostly early touches there and Derrick Rose as a ball-reliant point guard, there was too much competition for shots in that starting lineup. Off the bench, though, Wade can play with a green light against other teams\u2019 second units. Smith, meanwhile, has taken pride in his improvement as a defender, while retaining the 3-point potency that earns him his keep. So I\u2019m not surprised at all \u2014 this should have been Plan A. Shaun Powell :  This makes sense on all levels. J.R. was angry about coming off the bench? Then keep him happy. You need him to be productive and instead of pouting. Dwyane Wade, at this stage of his career, should be OK with a Sixth Man role, especially since he\u2019s likely to be on the floor in the fourth quarter when it counts. Does he really need the ego-gratifying gesture of starting, or is he more secure than that? I thought this should\u2019ve been the plan from the get-go; if it took three games to get it right, better late than never. John Schuhmann : It has always made sense. It was just a matter of how long pride and deference (to a future Hall of Famer) would get in the way. It was still interesting to see no nominal point guard (meaning no Jose Calderon, with both Isaiah Thomas and Derrick Rose injured) in the Cavs\u2019 rotation on Tuesday , with LeBron James acting as the point guard with the starters, Wade running the offense when James was on the bench, and the two of them only playing eight minutes together . That configuration puts the maximum amount of shooting around those guys and, not coincidentally, the win over the Bulls was the Cavs\u2019 best offensive game (127 points scored per 100 possessions) of the season so far .  Sekou Smith :  I am a little surprised the move came as soon as it did. Just watching the way the Cavaliers operated early on this season it was clear that not everyone was comfortable with the starting lineup and playing rotations. I know there are plenty of theories as to whose idea it was to make the change now. I don\u2019t feel like playing that game. I\u2019ll just go ahead and commend Dwyane Wade for recognizing that he wasn\u2019t a good fit in the first five and making the move sooner rather than later. It eases the pressure on all involved, Wade in particular. He knows he isn\u2019t the player he was as recently as four years ago. There\u2019s no shame in a future Hall of Famer making an adjustment to a reserve role at this stage of his career. And if and when he\u2019s needed in April and beyond, you know coach Tyronn Lue can count on getting the best from his starting group and his reserves.

What\u2019s next for these once-proud Phoenix Suns? Where do they go from here? * * * David Aldridge : They\u2019ll trade Bledsoe, sooner rather than later. But that doesn\u2019t really matter in the long run. The Suns have to get more out of their recent Lottery picks. T.J. Warren showed some promise last season, and I can\u2019t kill Phoenix for extending him rather than letting him become a restricted free agent. And we obviously don\u2019t have much data yet on rookie Josh Jackson, so he gets the benefit of the doubt. But they have to accelerate the development of Alex Len, Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss. No one made Phoenix take, at the time, a 19-year-old (Chriss) and an 18-year-old (Bender) in the first round in 2016 . When the Suns hired Watson, they spoke glowingly about his \u201cnatural leadership qualities and ability to connect with and motivate\u201d his young players. If that didn\u2019t work, it\u2019s an indictment of their choices as much as his. I know management and ownership scaled back and decided on a rebuild after their disappointing 2014-15 season, and fairness dictates they get enough time to try and see it through. But that\u2019s a difficult ask of a fan base that hasn\u2019t seen much winning for a while. Owner Robert Sarver and GM Ryan McDonough have to look at themselves, too, when addressing what\u2019s gone wrong there. Steve Aschburner : Geez, the days of Phoenix being a destination market and even something of a country club for veteran free agents seem way in the past. The Suns need to make a smart hire as coach , assuming Jay Triano has the job on an interim basis only. Earl Watson wasn\u2019t ready to be rushed into that spot in the wake of Jeff Hornacek\u2019s firing. Maybe opt for a career coach rather than a former player this time, to focus mostly on teaching in a real commitment to rebuilding. There are no shortcuts anymore for a franchise that has lost its luster for proven NBA stars. Shaun Powell :  The worst the Suns and GM Ryan McDonough can do is panic. This was going to be another year of rebuilding anyway, even with Watson and Bledsoe. Stay the course. Get reasonable value for Bledsoe (Denver would be my first phone call). Let the kids play and develop , meaning Devin Booker, Josh Jackson and Marquese Chriss. Find a taker, if possible, for Tyson Chandler, who never should\u2019ve been signed in the first place, who may have value to a contender. And if Jay Triano isn\u2019t the answer, then get a coach who works well with youth. John Schuhmann :  They have to continue to play the long game, focus on player development, and try to add more assets. It\u2019s kind of crazy to say this, but they should follow the models of Philadelphia and Brooklyn, two teams that found the right kind of coach for this phase of rebuilding. And part of player development has to be on the defensive end of the floor, because you can\u2019t just flip the switch when it comes time to compete for a playoff spot. The right habits need to be formed.  Sekou Smith : It\u2019s been so long since the Suns were a factor in the Western Conference. I wonder if many of the younger fans have any idea that, at one time, Steve Nash, Shawn Marion, Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, Quentin Richardson and Joe Johnson formed the core of a 62-win team that seemed destined to be a power for years to come. Where do the Suns go from there current predicament (coach fired, star on the trading block)? You turn to the one thing that always rescues a bad situation: your star player \u2014 and you move heaven and earth to surround him with the proper pieces. That player is Devin Booker. And if the Suns can\u2019t get this part right, then they deserve whatever eternal lottery fate awaits them. Booker has the game and star power to be the face of your franchise, but you have to go all-in building around him now. You have to bet on his future much the way the Golden State Warriors did with Stephen Curry when Monta Ellis was still on the roster. And no, I\u2019m not comparing Booker and Curry as players, but I am comparing the situations. You have to start somewhere with a franchise turnaround. And for the Suns, it all starts with Booker and whatever other quality pieces you put around him. * * *"},{"id":43538,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-shootaround-john-wall-no-mercy-lonzo-ball","date":"2017-10-25","title":"John Wall plans to show rookie Lonzo Ball 'no mercy'","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Wizards vs. Lakers (10:30 ET) Seven years ago, the Washington Wizards were fresh off a 26-win season and had the No. 1 pick in the 2010 Draft, John Wall , on the roster for 2010-11.

(AP) \u2014 Michigan approved $16 million in tax incentives Tuesday to aid the Detroit Pistons\u2019 construction of a practice facility and headquarters in downtown Detroit, money the team said is needed to defray expensive work removing contaminated soil. The Michigan Strategic Fund Board acted at the request of the city of Detroit\u2019s Brownfield Redevelopment Authority. The $107 million, four-story building will be jointly constructed by Pistons Performance LLC and the Henry Ford Health System, and will also include retail\/restaurant space, a parking deck and a sports medicine and medical office facility. \u201cThis to us is bigger than the arena that we play at because this is going to be our home for our basketball team and our company,\u201d said Richard Haddad, vice president and general counsel for the Pistons. The Pistons broke ground on the project Monday and last week opened the season in Little Caesars Arena, a new facility that was funded in part with public money and drew the team downtown from the suburbs for the first time in nearly four decades. The Detroit Red Wings also play hockey there. More than 200 Pistons employees will work at the downtown headquarters, which is expected to open in 2019. About 40 new full-time jobs with an average hourly wage of $15 will be created in the retail space, according to state economic development officials. Public subsidies for the arena totaling hundreds of millions of dollars have come under criticism in a city that declared bankruptcy in 2013. But Richard Barr, a lawyer who is working as a consultant on the project, said unlike other recent brownfield redevelopments, \u201cthis site really has an environmental history\u201d and has been used as nothing more than a tax-free parking lot for the past 30 years because it was owned by a hospital. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a facility with a $100 million investment, a substantial amount of income taxes, a substantial amount of property taxes,\u201d Barr said. Beneath the existing parking lot and bus garage, there is contaminated soil that will have to be excavated and removed, according to a memo prepared by the Michigan Economic Development Corp. Without the $16 million tax incentive, the cost to address the contamination would \u201cmake the project financially unfeasible,\u201d the memo said. The team has agreed to hire Detroit residents for 51 percent for construction jobs and Detroit contractors for 30 percent of construction work."},{"id":48739,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chicago-bulls-just-starting-long-road-rebuilding-team","date":"2017-10-24","title":"Long road to rebuilding just starting for Chicago Bulls","content":" * Tonight on NBA TV:  Bulls vs. Cavaliers (7 ET) Gregg Popovich pulled off one of the NBA\u2019s earliest, and undeniably fastest, examples of losing to win \u2014 suffering through such a lousy season that extra Draft lottery chances were the only reward. Early in the 1996-97 season, the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 future Hall of Fame center, David Robinson, went down with injuries . He played just six games in a span of two weeks in December, by which time coach Bob Hill was fired. The man who replaced Hill? Popovich, San Antonio\u2019s general manager. He took over on the day a presumably healthy Robinson returned, only to lose the big man before Christmas. With that, the Spurs\u2019 direction was set. Hill unwittingly had shown the path with that 3-15 start and Popovich, more knowingly, stomped on the gas. San Antonio went 17-47 the rest of the way, finishing with a better record than only Vancouver (14-68) and Boston (15-67). Then the Spurs caught the break and snagged the No. 1 pick in the 1997 draft .  Several good prospects, from Keith Van Horn to Chauncey Billups to Antonio Daniels to Tim Thomas to prep phenom Tracy McGrady, went anywhere from No. 2 to No. 9 overall . But there was only one Tim Duncan. Popovich grabbed him, teamed him up front with a healthy Robinson and never looked back. San Antonio went from 20 victories to 56 \u2014 a bigger improvement by one game than when Robinson arrived in 1989 \u2014 and has made the playoffs, with five NBA championships, every year for two decades since. Scrapping that 1996-97 season was like a boxer spitting out a tooth in the first round, then dominating the rest of the fight. It remains the gold standard for tank jobs and quick bounce-backs, which Popovich talked about over the weekend. \u201cGood fortune always helps, and we certainly had that,\u201d Popovich said before Saturday\u2019s game against Chicago at the United Center. \u201cAnd you hope you\u2019ve done your homework. That you\u2019ve done enough research into what kind of character guys have and how they\u2019re going to adjust to team play, and if they have the mental ability to grow and to learn and to become better players. Because lots of times, it\u2019s not a question of physicality, it\u2019s between the ears. And that\u2019s a function of character.\u201d While Popovich was talking, Cameron Payne \u2014 a point guard who is part of the Chicago Bulls\u2019 deep dive into lotteryland this season \u2014 came rolling down the hall. His right leg, bent at the knee, rested on the scooter while he pushed off with his left. The 23-year-old has played in 88 games in three-plus seasons and in 11 of a possible 25 since being acquired in February. He glided toward the home dressing room as essentially a poster guy for the risks and unpredictability of losing with a purpose. When a team\u2019s world gets intentionally turned upside down the way Chicago\u2019s has, every take must flip-flop as well. Payne\u2019s unavailability while he recovers from offseason foot surgery normally would be a drag; now it\u2019s a good thing, since it thins the herd of potentially available players. (Never mind that Payne struggled so obviously when he did appear for the Bulls late last season that losing might be easier with him on the floor.) Zach LaVine ( left ACL rehab ) and Kris Dunn ( left index finger dislocation ) are two more players whose injuries allegedly have hobbled Chicago \u2014 unless their inexperience and mistakes could accelerate the losing. That Bobby Portis-Nikola Mirotic incident last week was an organizational embarrassment. One thing Chicago had hoped to do this season was to stay below most NBA fans\u2019 radar, discreetly coughing up games while demonstrating only flashes of pluck and potential. Portis\u2019 practice-court haymaker to Mirotic wrenched an unwanted spotlight in the Bulls\u2019 direction. Then again, it sure was an effective way to handicap coach Fred Hoiberg and his coaching staff as far as available bigs. Rookie Lauri Markkanen has demonstrated skills and nerve, but he got thrown into the tank, so to speak, against the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Serge Ibaka and San Antonio Spurs\u2019 LaMarcus Aldridge in his first two NBA games. Chicago\u2019s first two games also served as examples of what the remaining 80 might look like. Against the Raptors, things were fine in the first, third and fourth quarters. But oh, that second quarter, a 33-14 blowout . Then the Bulls hung in with the Spurs for much of their home opener, except for San Antonio\u2019s 17-4 run through the middle of the third . That figures to be the best the Bulls can hope for \u2014 and presumably even desire \u2014 on most nights: Six to 12 minutes where they get swatted down like the pests they hope to be. Many nights will be worse, of course, in wire-to-wire dismantlings. But securing defeats in mere portions of games would allow them to claim *cough* moral victories, good energy and learning moments in an otherwise cynical and unfulfilling season. It\u2019s head-spinning to realize how recently the Bulls had ambition. Chicago native Derrick Rose became the league\u2019s youngest-ever Kia MVP in 2011 and, in and around his injuries, was part of a five-year window with coach Tom Thibodeau where winning mattered. Even last spring, Chicago grabbed the No. 8 spot in the East and built a 2-0 lead on No. 1 Boston until truculent point guard Rajon Rondo got hurt. Rondo\u2019s gone now, as are Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade. Wade nearly had to suffer through this rebuild until he worked out a buyout of $23.8 million salary , leaving cash behind to exit early and sign with Cleveland. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not there,\u201d Wade said in Milwaukee the other night. \u201cI\u2019m turning 36 years old this year. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of figuring it out. I wanted to be a part of something like this, where it\u2019s about winning and winning only. That\u2019s why I gave up a million dollars.\u201d Rose, Wade\u2019s new teammate in Cleveland, said of the Bulls: \u201cThat don\u2019t have anything to do with me. I\u2019m paying no attention to \u2018em, to be honest. I\u2019ve been focused on what I\u2019ve got going on here. Trying to stay away from that, that\u2019s my hometown. There\u2019s nothing to say about it \u2014 I don\u2019t even have a feeling about it. That\u2019s business.\u201d OK, so if the Bulls came calling next summer when Rose is a free agent, might he \u2026? \u201cNo,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey\u2019re rebuilding. I\u2019m trying to win a championship.\u201d When players are willing to give up serious dough to get or stay out of a situation that a team has to sell to fans accustomed to so much better, it isn\u2019t \u2014 and won\u2019t be \u2014 pretty. In this \u201cnew direction\u201d staked out by VP John Paxson and GM Gar Forman with bosses Jerry and Michael Reinsdorf\u2019s blessing, Chicago looks to be stocked mostly with players who talents will top as role players. Markkanen has a Kristaps Porzingis Lite feel to him, and LaVine seems to have the personality and leaping ability to sell some tickets. Dunn was a disappointment as a rookie. Justin Holiday currently might be prospering because of the limitations of players around him. Robin Lopez might be traded by the February deadline. The Chicago futures of Mirotic and Portis are unknown since their skirmish. And Paul Zipser, Denzel Valentine, Cristiano Felicio, Jerian Grant and the others are fortunate to have their names on the backs of their own jerseys, never mind any that get sold in the team shop. The Bulls are on the clock, too, with lottery rules that will change after the 2018 Draft to discourage these deep dives. They will have salary cap space next summer, in the vicinity of $38 million, but with a track record of being used for leverage rather than landing the brightest stars. No one, either, is promising that college basketball\u2019s current top prospects will have a Duncan-like impact. In short, this might take a while, and it already feels long. Popovich was asked about his friend and former assistant coach Brett Brown (now coach of the Philadelphia 76ers). Brown endured four miserable seasons of \u201cThe Process\u201d before being permitted to get serious about winning this season. \u201cI\u2019d have cried and moaned and gotten fired a long time ago if I was in his position,\u201d Popovich said.

After making the All-Rookie Second Team during his rookie season, Garnett skyrocketed to stardom in his next two seasons with averages of 17.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.5 steals. He made his first of 15 All-Star teams at age 20, and his first of nine All-NBA teams at age 22. Garnett saw plenty of individual and regular season success in Minnesota, but the postseason got the best of his squad. Garnett, fresh off winning the 2004 NBA MVP, advanced past the first round for the first time during 2003-04, leading the Timberwolves all the way to the Western Conference finals. Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and the Lakers were too much for the Timberwolves, though, eliminating Garnett and Co. in six games. Garnett was traded to the Boston Celtics in July 2007 to join forces with Ray Allen and Paul Pierce. The trio quickly gelled, winning 66 games during the 2007-08 season before powering through the playoffs to claim the 2008 championship. That season, Garnett won his only Defensive Player of the Year award and also finished third in MVP voting. In The 2008 Finals, he averaged 18.2 points, 13.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.7 steals. Garnett played six more seasons in Boston before being traded to Brooklyn in 2013. He finished his career back in Minnesota, spending his final two seasons as a veteran mentor for the team. The NBA legend retired in 2016 with career averages of 17.8 points, 10.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.3 steals. He ranks within the top 20 in NBA history for points, rebounds, blocks, steals, games, and minutes.

Two games into the 1994-95 season, Smith was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, where he would play some of the best basketball of his career. Smith averaged 18.6 points and 3.6 assists over four-plus seasons in Atlanta and his first and only All-Star team in 1997-98. Smith was traded to Portland during the summer of 1999, joining forces with one of the best teams in the West.

The Greek Freak\u2019s 32 points against the Hornets on Monday marked his worst outing yet. It was still just enough to give him a remarkable if esoteric achievement: a franchise-record 147 points through four games, one more than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar recorded in 1969. Combined with his usual all-around impact \u2014 a season-high 14 rebounds, along with six assists, one steal and two blocks \u2014 and it was yet another masterpiece for the blossoming young superstar. If it\u2019s too early to start talking about the Kia MVP award, let\u2019s just say that whenever that time does come, Antetokounmpo will be No. 1 with a bullet barring a drop-off that, so far, seems almost impossible. Monday\u2019s outing was another edition of Antetokounmpo\u2019s special brand of jaw-dropping, long-limbed bully ball. In a league that continues to emphasize outside shooting, just four of his 21 shots came outside the restricted area, and only one outside the paint. Despite that one-dimensionality, the Hornets \u2014 like the Celtics , Cavs and Blazers before them \u2014 were powerless to stop him as he converted 13 shots and drew eight free throws. If not quite as spectacularly as Saturday\u2019s win over Portland, which he sealed with a steal, slam and blocked shot in the final 12.1 seconds, Antetokounmpo saved his best for last against the Hornets. He dominated the fourth, scoring 11 points with six rebounds and a pair of blocks. His lone assist in the period set up Khris Middleton for the biggest shot of the game, a 3-pointer that put the Bucks up five with 43 seconds left. Antetokounmpo is now averaging 36.8 points, 10.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists, joining Russell Westbrook as the only players to reach those thresholds through four games. That represents just five percent of the marathon that is an NBA season.

Shaking off his early season shooting woes, the rookie picked his spots while sinking 8 of 11 shots from the floor. The rest of his production on Monday was down to his unique combination of size, skill and IQ, attributes that have led Sixers coach Brett Brown to give Simmons the keys to the Sixers\u2019 offense and let him go as their de facto point guard at 6-foot-10. While not as athletic or explosive as the aforementioned James, Simmons bore more than a little similarity to the four-time MVP as he routinely used his size to look over Detroit\u2019s defense and pick out the open man with simple-but-smart passes. That\u2019s not so say the rookie doesn\u2019t have some flash \u2014 far from it. Witness his behind-the-back pass to Joel Embiid for an early 3-pointer, or his lefty power slam off a crossover late in the third quarter.

He came to me and said, `You know what coach? What you said was right. I\u2019d be able to be featured more in the second unit and be able to handle the ball more, so let\u2019s make that move and make that adjustment.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s what professionals do. No ego. He saw it was best for the team for him to come off the bench. It was his call and here we are.\u201d The Cavs are going through some early, expected growing pains as Lue tries to blend new players into the team\u2019s systems. Wade felt taking on a different role would accelerate the process. \u201cThe biggest thing is, man, we\u2019re three games in the season,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all figure it out. We\u2019re all figuring it out together. The one thing is, you want to be healthy enough so that we can play the lineups that we want to play together and then the rest of it will come. Shots will go in for guys, rhythm will come for guys.\u201d The 35-year-old Wade has spent virtually his entire 15-year pro career as a starter, and as fate would have it, the 12-time All-Star will come off the bench on Tuesday night when the Cavs host the Chicago Bulls. Wade spent last season with his hometown team following 13 years in Miami, where he was teammates with LeBron James on four Heat teams that made the NBA Finals. James expected Wade to go through an adjustment period. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good place,\u201d James said of his close friend. \u201cI think the first week, like he told y\u2019all, was a long week for him just trying to adjust to a new system, adjust to what we\u2019re trying to do. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just him. I mean, obviously he has the name but a lot of guys are trying to adjust as well. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out, how can we help these guys get acclimated as quickly as possible? But this is a marathon. And he knows it. He\u2019s been a part of it and it\u2019s not a sprint. So, Week 2 is going to be much better than Week 1 for all of us.\u201d The Cavs will be without starting point Derrick Rose, who is still recovering from a sprained ankle. Lue expects the former league MVP to be out a week. Jose Calderon will start until Rose is back."},{"id":43600,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-golden-state-warriors-coach-steve-kerr-outspoken-willing-listen","date":"2017-10-23","title":"Coach Steve Kerr more than willing to speak up -- and listen, too","content":" The times in which he lives created Steve Kerr. If he had become the Golden State Warriors\u2019 coach 10 years ago, he wouldn\u2019t have the NBA\u2019s highest profile coaching gig, and he wouldn\u2019t be working in a time where the most polarizing president (perhaps ever, and certainly since Lincoln) was in the White House. And there wouldn\u2019t be 7,961 media outlets at every practice, and every game, asking him his opinions. Or, if Kevin Durant had decided not to take another job last summer, many of those 7,961 media outlets could very well be in Cleveland right now, asking the two-time defending NBA champion Cavaliers if they\u2019ll be able to three-peat. And, Kerr hadn\u2019t been so bad at his job in Phoenix as the Suns\u2019 general manager, he might have changed the NBA world then, rather than now. And, if his world hadn\u2019t been shattered in 1984 , none of this would matter to him so much. The horrific and the humanity and the humor all have molded Steve Kerr, at 52, into what and where he is today, a coach atop a leviathan, the irresistible force and the immovable object. His Warriors are the biggest favorites to repeat since Grandmaster Flash started scratching . And, rather than making the media an enemy \u2014 the MO of seemingly every Power Five football coach in America \u2014 or denouncing original thoughts or statements by his players as \u201cdistractions,\u201d Kerr not only embraces both, but says what he actually thinks about what\u2019s happening in the world, too. \u201cI think some people probably think I spend all my time studying politics, and I don\u2019t,\u201d he said last week. \u201cI spend most of my time watching basketball and planning practice for the next day and thinking about the game. That\u2019s my true passion. But I do read a lot about politics and I follow what\u2019s going on, and I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m worried about our country. That\u2019s really the gist of my feeling comfortable about speaking out.\u201d The Warriors entered this season feeling they didn\u2019t need to make any gestures during the playing of the national anthem, because they\u2019d been free to speak their minds all summer about just about everything. Their coach didn\u2019t muzzle them; their organization didn\u2019t threaten them. So Stephen Curry said he didn\u2019t really feel like going to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump , and the President disinvited the team, and the team shrugged. Kerr, who wanted his players to, as he put it, \u201cfill their cups\u201d in decompressing fully from their season\u2019s pursuit, told them not to show up at the team\u2019s practice facility in Oakland until the day before Media Day. So Curry finished his golfing summer, which included stops in London and Paris and the Hamptons (\u201cthe only time I\u2019d been there was last year, for about 12 hours,\u201d Curry said, but that\u2019s another story ). And Klay Thompson made fun of himself \u2014 and, probably, eleventy billion dollars \u2014 in China. And Draymond Green\u2019s family grew by one. And Nick Young, aka \u201cSwaggy P,\u201d grabbed a uni \u2014 because he can shoot, and the Warriors are always looking for shooters. But also because Kerr has created an environment that embraces a player\u2019s past rather than questions it (see JaVale McGee\u2019s seamless arrival last season), and because Kerr and GM Bob Myers have created a seamless partnership (much like Gregg Popovich and R.C. Buford in San Antonio). And in the process, Myers and Kerr have become closer friends than either thought possible when Kerr took the job in 2014 . \u201cThe thing that attracts people to Steve is he\u2019s very gracious,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Steve; it\u2019s about the players. And I think maybe, that\u2019s who he is; you can say that\u2019s just who he is. He\u2019s learned compassion from what he\u2019s gone through in his life. And also, he\u2019s played in and won five championships. So he\u2019s not chasing the Holy Grail of a championship; he wants it for these players. He\u2019s done it five times (as a player). \u201cSo I think players, more than anybody else, can feel when a coach makes it about them as opposed to him. And I think that\u2019s when you have people following a coach, when they believe, you know what? He\u2019s just trying to help us win a championship. That\u2019s his whole agenda. And Steve, on those two fronts, has been pretty unbelievable.\u201d Kerr may not have known for sure he would coach during his 15-year NBA playing career, but he certainly had tossed the idea around, even before he became a pro.  \u201cHis choices were always made for him, based on his playing. That was what he was going to do until he finished,\u201d said Warriors assistant Bruce Fraser, who\u2019s known Kerr since their days at Arizona playing under Lute Olsen \u2014 and whose nickname, \u201cQ\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cQuestion Man\u201d \u2014 came from Kerr. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he always said \u2018I\u2019m going to be a coach,\u2019 but we talked about coaching,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cWhen he first went into the NBA with the Suns, his first year (1988), he wasn\u2019t playing much , and he started saying \u2018I\u2019d rather be where you are.\u2019 And I was a grad assistant (at Arizona). And I was saying, \u2018I\u2019d rather be where you are \u2014 playing.\u201d Kerr started this season with a three-year regular season mark of 207-39, which sounds like the record of a high school football coach who\u2019s lorded over a rural district for 30 years with no real competition for miles. By contrast, Kerr\u2019s team is playing in the best league in the world and puts up those kinds of cartoonish numbers. His team plays with joy ( well, most of the time ), and its dominance in the playoffs last season forced teams to go all in this summer to even have a chance against them next spring. And they expect to be even better this year than last, even though they lost on ring night last week at home. \u201cMy mind\u2019s a little bit more relaxed now,\u201d Durant said Tuesday, after the loss to the Rockets . \u201cIt sucks to lose, but we see the big picture, and we know we have to get better. When we have setbacks, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the end of the world; it\u2019s all right, let\u2019s lock in and see what we have to do to get better. It\u2019s a long season. Just keep growing. Last year was more of a panic for me if we lost, because it was like, man, this team is so good, we\u2019re not supposed to lose.\u201d Durant would stand on the weakside often last season and wait for the ball, which was antithetical to the best practices of the Warriors\u2019 offense. The secret sauce is in the constant movement of all five players. The four players on the floor in a given time without the ball are the important ones, not the guy dribbling. But now, Durant screens away, sets a veer screen or cuts to the basket. Whether he winds up with the ball is almost irrelevant; if he doesn\u2019t, someone else will, and likely with a better shot, because of what his movement forces the defense to do. And that\u2019s why Kerr, like Popovich, always thinks if a player makes it to the second season in the system, his growth is exponential. \u201cKD is so much more comfortable with what we do,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cLast year his head was spinning the first couple of months. (He was) still getting 25 a night because he\u2019s KD. But everything now is instinctive. It\u2019s just understood, and he\u2019s comfortable \u2026 he understands that what we\u2019re trying to do is constant movement and screening and cutting \u2014 and no waiting. No waiting for an iso. And last year it took him a while to figure that out. This year, he\u2019s dialed in.\u201d But Kerr has had more than his star player\u2019s disposition on his mind lately. After a sniper opened fire on people at a concert in Las Vegas earlier this month , leading to the deaths of 59 people, Kerr referenced the assassination of his father, Malcolm Kerr, then the president of the American University of Beirut, in 1984, in advocating for stronger gun control laws . He mocked Trump\u2019s disinvitation in September, comparing it someone dumping his or her significant other before they got dumped first. He took Colin Kaepernick\u2019s side on the issue of kneeling to protest police brutality , after last year denouncing the police killing of motorist Terence Crutcher, an unarmed African-American man, in Oklahoma. Kerr says he\u2019s not speaking to hear himself talk, that the times demand responses. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t that outspoken 10 years ago, maybe because nobody asked me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it seemed like the country was more comfortable and there wasn\u2019t this divide. I haven\u2019t seen this kind of divide in my lifetime. I\u2019m sure it existed during Vietnam, but I was five years old and six years old when that came to a head. And the fact that there\u2019s so much media now means that I\u2019m getting asked about current political divide. \u201cI get asked about it all the time. But I feel comfortable talking about it because I feel like it\u2019s important. I feel really strongly about the issues that are going on right now. It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s a very scary time right now for our country. And I think it\u2019s important for everybody to speak their mind. I just happen to have a very big platform.\u201d Kerr believes social media outlets like Twitter have helped further fuel the divide. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ll give you the Jemele Hill example,\u201d Kerr says, referencing the ESPN anchor disciplined twice in the last month, First, in September, Hill sent out a tweet that, in her view, President Trump was a white supremacist . She was then suspended for two weeks Oct. 9 after returning to Twitter , and saying that football fans who disagreed with Dallas Cowboys\u2019 owner Jerry Jones\u2019 assertion that he\u2019d discipline any of his players that \u201cdisrespected the flag\u201d had the option of, among other things, boycotting Jones\u2019s companies. \u201cIn the past, 20 years ago, Jemele Hill would have been at a cocktail party, and she would have said all of those things that she tweeted at the cocktail party,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd she would have gone home and she would have gone to her job the next day, and nobody would have known. Same thing with me, when I\u2019ve said what I said criticizing Trump. I would have done it at a dinner party. I didn\u2019t have access to social media.  \u201cAnd I try to avoid tweeing now, for several reasons. But the fact is, now, everything\u2019s out there. And there\u2019s a lot of sort of spontaneous conversation that happens. And you get really angry. I get pretty angry when I\u2019m on Twitter, and I read what people are saying, either to me, or publicly. And there\u2019s an impulse to just (respond). But 20 or 30 years ago, you didn\u2019t have that constant back and forth, and so it wasn\u2019t as divisive, it wasn\u2019t as angry.\u201d Obviously, Kerr coaches in a league where almost all of the game\u2019s superstars and many of power wielders are black, and black people as a whole tend to be much more liberal than whites on most social issues. So Kerr, clearly liberal, isn\u2019t exactly swimming upstream with his positions on social issues, as he a) coaches a team with four of the league\u2019s biggest superstars, all men of color, b) coaches in the Bay Area, one of the most liberal enclaves on earth, and c) now has seven NBA titles as a player or coach after picking up his second with Golden State, giving him gravitas that, say, Sacramento Kings coach Dave Joerger does not yet have. Yet there are many liberal coaches in the NBA who don\u2019t speak out or speak up. Popovich and Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy are among Kerr\u2019s brethren who have been crystal clear in their denouncements of Trump over the last year. But everyone doesn\u2019t speak up or speak out. Kerr does. He says that the NBA\u2019s recent commissioners, Adam Silver and David Stern, helped set the tone that makes NBA coaches more comfortable speaking out than coaches in other sports. Kerr also credits NBA owners. \u201cI think our owners are more tolerant, much more capable of saying \u2018you know what? You guys (have) the First Amendment \u2014 right to free speech, freedom of expression. You guys express yourselves. But let\u2019s talk about it as a team,\u2019\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI know we\u2019ve done that as a group. We\u2019ve talked to (Warriors co-owner) Joe Lacob as a group. We\u2019ve talked about what it would mean to kneel, how we want to address social issues. So it\u2019s just much more out in the open. We don\u2019t have an owner who says \u2018if you guys kneel you\u2019re not going to play.\u2019 Like, what is that? To me, that\u2019s insane.\u201d Myers says that the whole \u201cstick to sports\u201d idea is, in today\u2019s hot take world, a myth, anyway. \u201cTo really say no one wants to hear what Steph Curry or Steve has to say about anything outside of basketball, that\u2019s not true,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. Even the narratives around our sport, so much of it revolves around the humanity around it more than the box scores. \u201cThe fans of the NBA want to hear about story lines. They love free agency. They love the Draft. They love the trade deadline. These are stories about the people, these are stories about situations. They\u2019re not stories about who won and who lost that game. So when you talk about Steve Kerr, we encourage an organization where, you know what, be authentic.\u201d Myers says there\u2019s a \u201cbalancing act\u201d between speaking your mind and being authentic to yourself and what you believe, and also understanding you\u2019re an employee of a company whose purpose is to put an orange ball through a basket, not conduct trade talks with China. \u201cWe get that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a political machine; we\u2019re a basketball team. But we don\u2019t want to muzzle someone and have someone who feels they have something to say, but they\u2019re not afforded the opportunity to say \u2026 the best thing about going to work here is, you get to be who you are. \u201cWho wants to go to work in an environment where they don\u2019t get to be authentically themselves? And by the way, one thing that I always say about Steve speaking on what he speaks about, whether it\u2019s gun violence or anything in the political world, he lost his father to a violent, political, gun-related death. I would allow anyone with that kind of standing to speak on an issue that\u2019s that dear to them. This isn\u2019t just a guy on a soapbox. This is a guy that was personally affected by something. So as an organization, who am I to say \u2018just talk about pick and roll coverage, Steve?\u2019 \u201d  If the times have pushed Kerr to be more vocal, his own past errors pushed him to be more collaborative. \u201cI was not a good GM in Phoenix,\u201d he says. \u201cI made some mistakes. We had a great coach in Mike D\u2019Antoni. We had some differences. There were some things that I regret that happened. When I got to Golden State as head coach I went straight to Bob and I said \u2018Bob, I know you\u2019ve been through your share of adversity the last couple of years. You probably have some regrets. I know I\u2019ve got regrets. I\u2019ve seen this with Pop and R.C., and we have to be tied at the hip.\u2019 And Bob agreed, and we talked about that right away.\u201d Warriors president Rick Welts, who held a similar position in Phoenix at the time Kerr was there, saw a different guy than he sees in the Bay today. \u201cHe looked like a train wreck more days than not, to tell you the truth,\u201d Welts said. \u201cThere were some decisions that, in the moment, he regretted making. And I think ultimately, inside, he wanted to be on the sidelines. This was not the same. It was a different environment, dealing with different things than what he dealt with before. And, as knowledgeable as he is about the game, and as knowledgeable as he was about the game then, it wasn\u2019t joyful. And Steve needs to be in a situation where his joy can add to the chemistry of the team.\u201d In the Bay, there\u2019s been no pitting the coach against management. Not when management asked the coach to drive past his house after practice just to look at the goofy holiday decorations outside. Independent of one another, Kerr and Myers cited, for different reasons, the exact moment their business relationship began to become a close personal relationship: after Game 3 of the 2015 conference semifinals against Memphis , when the Grizzlies had taken a 2-1 series lead. Myers remembers Kerr earnestly asking him, \u2018Bob, what do you think,?\u2019 as Myers walked into the quiet locker room; Kerr remembers Myers trying to lessen the pressure he was feeling. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018you\u2019re a rookie coach. You\u2019re not supposed to win the championship your first year,\u2019\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd it was total BS. But he was saying it. It was the right thing to say.\u201d Myers worried about the frictional nature of the coach-GM relationship: either the coach didn\u2019t coach the players given to him correctly (often, the GM\u2019s view) or the GM didn\u2019t provide the right players conducive to winning (often, the coach\u2019s view). If their relationship was merely transactional in that way, it may not have worked. But, it wasn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been through some stuff (Myers\u2019s brother-in-law, Scott Dinsmore, was killed in a rockslide while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in 2015), with my wife\u2019s family, and he\u2019s been through some stuff,\u201d Myers said. \u201cAnd how he reacted to that, I will never forget. Sadly, in life, it takes great loss to understand great loss. And it doesn\u2019t mean that people who haven\u2019t had tragedy aren\u2019t equipped to empathize. They are. But it\u2019s a bad club to be in. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in the club, it\u2019s the only way to really know loss-personal loss, like immediate, sudden tragedy. So whether we ever win or lose any more games, that moment, when he reached out to my wife\u2019s family, those are what makes relationships. That\u2019s why, when we won, I cried. I cried with my wife and my kids, because you put a lot into this. Every GM does. It\u2019s not just me. Every GM. And when I hugged Steve, I cried. That\u2019s what makes sports so beautiful. It\u2019s the relationships.\u201d Before the end came last season, though, Kerr to adjust his rearview mirror. Curry was on board with bringing Durant in, because it would make the team better. But that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t struggle in stretches last season. The first two months, Curry couldn\u2019t find his way, but especially in December, when his scoring average dropped almost six points, and he shot 42.7 percent from the floor and 37.5 percent on 3-pointers \u2014 a perfectly fine percentage from deep for most mortals, but not for him. The nadir for Curry came on Christmas Day in Cleveland against the Cavaliers. He only got 11 shots, scored just 15 points , and was on the floor when the Cavs mounted a furious fourth-quarter comeback to steal the game. The Warriors were 27-5, but their two-time Kia MVP wasn\u2019t all that happy, and Kerr knew it. \u201cWe just got back from Cleveland, and I didn\u2019t have a great game, and obviously we lost a tough one on the road, and that was kind of the first moment that he realized, for me, the change in the dynamic of the team was kind of in my head a little bit,\u201d Curry said. \u201cAnd he made a point to see if I was around the next day \u2014 we had an off day the next day \u2014 and see if I was around. He came over. We sat in my living room and we talked for about an hour, hour and a half. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if anything groundbreaking was said, but just the gesture of him coming over, laying everything on the table, what I saw, what we could do differently, from a playcalling standpoint or just from my mindset standpoint. We hashed some stuff out, and if you look at the direction of our team after that game, it was pretty solid.\u201d After Kerr\u2019s seemingly endless back problems caused him to miss the first 11 games of the playoffs , leaving associate head coach Mike Brown in charge, Kerr came back for the last four games of The Finals. He didn\u2019t put Brown back in a proverbial corner. He listened to him. \u201cOne of the things I thought offensively that would help us against Cleveland was, they were doing a lot of switching when it came to pick and rolls defensively,\u201d Brown recalled. \u201cI thought, hey, let\u2019s run a side pick and roll, and let\u2019s send two guys on a \u201cdouble drag \u2014 a double ball screen, which would space two shooters on the backside, and put Cleveland in some different types of split action , with guys who weren\u2019t used to guarding it. \u201cI brought that to his attention, and he thought about it, and the next thing you know, we ran it. And we not only ran it, it became a staple of what we were doing offensively from that point going forward the rest of the series against Cleveland. What that does for me is, it makes me want to continue to find different ways to help us win, and throw ideas at him. Because you know he\u2019s listening.\u201d It was similar to what Kerr did when he came back midway through the 2015-16 season , after then assistant coach Luke Walton had coached the Warriors to a 39-4 record. (Because Walton was \u201cacting\u201d head coach and not officially the Warriors\u2019 coach, Kerr got credit for all those wins.) It is what he did when his assistant and analytics guy, Nick U\u2019Ren, suggested the Warriors bench starting center Andrew Bogut in Game 4 of The 2015 Finals , with Golden State down 2-1, in favor of Andre Iguodala, to make the Warriors smaller but faster, and better equipped to defend the Cavaliers. It is what he does with Fraser. \u201cIn business, regular business, people always say, \u2018don\u2019t work with friends,\u2019 \u201d Fraser said. \u201cI think this is a different business. One of my values to him is he wants my voice, because he trusts that at least it will be the truth, right or wrong. Maybe I\u2019ve overstepped my voice at times, but I think he wants truth.\u201d Myers cites the U\u2019Ren story as the best example of Kerr\u2019s ability to, as Myers says, deflect. \u201cThe best part about that, I think, that has never been written, is that had we lost that game, Steve Kerr would have never mentioned Nick U\u2019Ren\u2019s name,\u201d Myers said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have heard it. Because when they asked Steve, \u2018why\u2019d you start Iguodala?,\u2019 he would have never said \u2018you know, I shouldn\u2019t have listened to Nick U\u2019Ren. Why the hell did I listen to him? He\u2019s a 27-year-old guy.\u2019 You would have never heard it. And so the beauty of Steve, if you want to know about Steve, it\u2019s in that moment, when something worked that wasn\u2019t his idea. He absolutely praised that person. Had it not worked, the better story would have been, you would have never heard about it.\u201d The Warriors have started out 1-2 after Curry and Durant got ejected in Saturday\u2019s loss to Memphis. They\u2019re pretty sanguine, still. They lost their opener at home last year, too, and proceeded to win 82 of their next 98. It\u2019s pretty sanguine in the home of the champs. When Durant got his ring Tuesday, he walked back toward his coaches and teammates who\u2019d lined up together. But his mind was wandering. \u201cJust reflecting and thinking about how hard it is to be in the NBA,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be on a good team, and then a winning team, and to win a championship, that\u2019s hard, too. Just thinking about what it just took to get to this point, and how much work I have to keep doing.\u201d Whatever is after \u201cprohibitive favorites,\u201d that\u2019s where Golden State remains. Assuming his back pain doesn\u2019t return to the point where it\u2019s permanently debilitating (\u201cI\u2019m coping,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can probably tell; I\u2019m uncomfortable\u201d), Kerr\u2019s planning to be studying film, and breaking the occasional clipboard, and cracking that Curry \u201cendangered hundreds of spectators\u201d by flinging his mouthpiece at the ref Saturday, and calling out the President of the United States if he thinks he deserves it, for a long time. \u201cIf I retired at 60, I think I\u2019d be like, now what do I do?,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cMaybe things will change.

No one had to ask Avery Bradley to do it; that\u2019s what he did in Boston, as the Celtics rebuilt their franchise from the championship contending days through the dark years, taking what he\u2019d learned from KG and Pierce and dropping that knowledge on Boston\u2019s younger players. Bradley played 413 games over seven seasons in Boston from 2010, when the Celtics took him in the first round out of Texas , until last July 7, when Boston traded him to Detroit so that the Celtics could clear cap room to sign free agent Gordon Hayward. He wasn\u2019t exactly shocked; even though he\u2019d provided Boston with great perimeter defense \u2014 breaking on the scene in 2012 when he stuffed Dwyane Wade at the rim in a nationally televised game  \u2014 and gradually improved his offensive game the last few seasons to be a complement to Thomas in the Boston backcourt last year, he knew Boston had been building for this moment, when it could attract an impact free agent. Yet another one of the stream of players from the Seattle-Tacoma area, Bradley played much of his early ball in the same backcourts in the area with Abdul Gaddy, a star guard in his own right that wound up going to the University of Washington. But Bradley went to Findlay Prep in Vegas before going to Texas as a one-and-done. Again starting over, now at 26, Bradley will take over for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope at the two for the Pistons, with Stan Van Gundy needing proven veteran voices in his still-relatively young locker room. Bradley\u2019s looking to show he can score and defend, and earn a big payday as one of the top two-way guards available in free agency, whether in Detroit or elsewhere. Me: I wonder if it\u2019s easy to turn the page on Boston now that the games have started, or is there a part of you that\u2019s still processing what happened? Avery Bradley: Yeah, part of me still is. But I\u2019m just taking it day by day, game by game. I\u2019m just going out there trying to compete, playing the way that I know how to play, and not thinking about it. At the end of the day, this is a business. I understand that. The Celtics made some decisions that they needed to make to better their organization, so I respect that. Now I\u2019m here and I\u2019m part of a great organization. I have some great teammates and a great coach, and I\u2019m just looking forward to keep growing as a player and a person. I continue to say that. I think I\u2019m definitely going to continue growing here. Me: Did Stan say specifically that they want you to grow and evolve here as a player and a leader? AB: Yes, they have. That\u2019s something that me and Stan talked about over the summer, and now once the season\u2019s started, you can see that he\u2019s given me the opportunity. I\u2019m taking it day by day as far as leadership. I don\u2019t want to just come in here and boss people around. I\u2019m trying to lead by example. But I\u2019m definitely challenging myself to be a better player, the player I want to be. Me: Where do you think you need to improve? AB: Offensively, I feel like I have a chance to show more of my game. And defensively, I just want to continue to grow as well. I want to give myself a chance to not only make first team (all defense), but be in the Defensive Player of the Year conversation. Me: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the debates about you as a defensive player among the analytics community and players , with some in the advanced numbers community saying you\u2019re overrated on D. What do you think of that? AB: I think basketball, you know, it\u2019s all about what your peers think, the guys you\u2019re actually playing against. I respect the numbers as well, \u2018cause numbers don\u2019t lie. But there\u2019s a lot of other things that factor into numbers as well. It\u2019s all about respecting the game, to me. Respecting the game is giving credit where credit\u2019s due, and I feel like I should always be in that conversation every single year. No matter who I\u2019m playing against, they\u2019re going to say that I\u2019m one of the toughest guys they play, for sure. Me: So what\u2019s important to you as a defensive player \u2014 about what do you say \u2018if I\u2019m doing this well, then I\u2019m doing my job?\u2019 AB: I think making every possession hard. This is the NBA; you can\u2019t stop everybody from scoring 30. But that 30? They\u2019re going to work for every point they get. And that\u2019s my mindset. Me: This team is a veteran squad in some ways, but they\u2019re still kind of young in important spots. What do you see that they need to take the next step? AB: The number one thing is to all buy in to what Stan\u2019s trying to do. That\u2019s the first thing. And just being mature, being professionals, understanding that we have to go out and do our job each and every night, and make some sacrifices. Because on a young team, you have guys trying to prove themselves. At the same time, if you make sacrifices, it\u2019s all about winning. Once you\u2019re able to win, you\u2019re able to be more established as a player as well. It\u2019s hand in hand. And then you can show more parts of your game. As long as guys can understand that, I feel like this could be a fun year for us. We could definitely give ourselves a chance to make the playoffs, and maybe get out of the first round and have a good year. Me: Have you talked to Isaiah? AB: Yeah. We spoke, I texted him actually just after the Gordon (Hayward) incident. I was just like, man. That\u2019s unfortunate. Me:  You and Isaiah are from Tacoma , and so many guys are from Seattle. Why does there continue to be so many really good players from that relatively small area? AB: Maybe it\u2019s the rain. Maybe it\u2019s keeping us inside on the courts. I don\u2019t know, man. We do have a lot of talent. Even (Spurs\u2019 second-year guard) Dejounte Murray played well the other night. We just have a lot of talent. I think it\u2019s all about heart. A lot of players up there, it\u2019s all about heart, going out there and proving yourselves every night. You can see that in all the players. Me: Chip on your shoulder, like Jet (Jason Terry) and Nate Robinson. AB: A little chip on your shoulder \u2014 Nate. Even Zach LaVine. When he comes back, he\u2019s going to play with a chip on his shoulder. Me: The Celtics decided to blow up last year\u2019s team, even though it was successful. Is there any part of you that wonders why? AB: There\u2019s a lot of what ifs. But like I said, it\u2019s a business, and that\u2019s not our decisions to make \u2014 it\u2019s Danny (Ainge) and the guys up there in the front office. All you can do is respect that and move on. One thing I understand about this league is you have to do what\u2019s best for you, as players and as organizations. So I respect every decision they made. Me: You still talk with Gaddy? AB: Yeah, we talk every day. I talk to him every day before practice. Me: What\u2019s he doing now? AB: He\u2019s playing in Germany. He played in Italy, and he played in Latvia. Now he\u2019s in Germany. Me: I asked because y\u2019all played so many years together growing up, and then, all of a sudden, your last year in high school, you split up. And I wondered if having that kind of experience early kind of prepares you for a sudden changes like this summer? AB: Yeah, exactly. And, you want to know something? Once I left Abdul, I grew as a player. So I believe God puts us into situations to be the people we\u2019re supposed to be. So maybe this is the same thing. Me leaving Isaiah, somebody I\u2019m used to playing with. We learned how to play off of each other. Maybe this is a chance for me to show more of my game. \u2014 JaVale McGee ( @JaValeMcGee34 ), Wednesday, 10:43 p.m., displaying the hardware that was given out Tuesday before the Warriors\u2019 regular season opener.

Portis apologized to the team for the fight on Friday. \u201cFor 50 years I shut the world out. Everything became second. Now, as much pressure as I have here, I\u2019m not going to allow it to do to me what it used to. It was toxic. Negative.

From A.J. Jaramillo: Unfortunately, A.J., you don\u2019t get to decide which championships are \u201clegitimate\u201d and which are not. Every team that wins a title, no matter how it was constructed or who is on it, has earned it. You can\u2019t devalue any of LeBron\u2019s titles any more than you can any of Bill Russell\u2019s 11. They earned all of them. If James had gone to Chicago and played with a healthy Derrick Rose and gotten Dwyane Wade to come, and they\u2019d won two titles, those wouldn\u2019t be real? Come on. And Kevin Durant\u2019s pursuit of a title is of no concern to you, me or anyone else. He\u2019s a grown man who had the right to pick where he wanted to go; he wasn\u2019t required to keep banging his head against the proverbial wall to pass some kind of \u201cpurity\u201d test. If he\u2019d chosen Boston instead, and the KD\/Horford\/Isaiah Thomas Celtics were the defending champs, that narrative is somehow better than the one he wrote in the Bay? I don\u2019t buy that. NBA teams are, increasingly, owned by billionaire owners who staff front offices filled with Ivy Leaguers or equivalents who have mastered analytics and think they can unpick the lock of success. They are accountable for the teams they put on the floor as much as the players. You want to beat the Warriors? Build a better team than they have, and pay for it. Prescient. From Alex Burg: Alex wrote this before the Suns fired Earl Watson on Sunday and named Jay Triano interim head coach. The short answer to his question, though, is found in that firing. There isn\u2019t anyone outside Phoenix\u2019s management that thinks the Suns\u2019 awful, awful start \u2014 0 and 3 out of the gate, including 48- and 42-point shellackings by the Blazers and Clippers, respectively \u2014 is just Watson\u2019s fault. Ownership, in the form of Robert Sarver, and management, in the form of GM Ryan McDonough, will be on their third head coach together since the improbable 48-34 season of 2013-14. They\u2019re the ones that have traded Goran Dragic and Isaiah Thomas, and gave Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight $70 million extensions, and gave Tyson Chandler $52 million (yes, in pursuit of LaMarcus Aldridge, but gambles that don\u2019t pay off aren\u2019t celebrated), and have seen none of their Lottery picks look like budding superstars yet. And they\u2019re the reason, I\u2019m told, that Bledsoe wants out. Bledsoe\u2019s \u201cI Dont wanna be here\u201d tweet , posted Sunday afternoon, just before news of Watson\u2019s firing broke, was not directed at Watson, a source said. Yet another source that\u2019s been around the team put more blame \u2014 70 percent, the source said \u2014 on Watson. And that\u2019s why a decision to rebuild through the Draft and\/or young players is such a major one for a franchise. It\u2019s damn near impossible for a team filled with kids to consistently win in the NBA when playing against veteran teams that know what they\u2019re doing and have continuity among their core players. Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss are very talented young players. But it takes so long for kids to grow up, and they don\u2019t grow up at the same pace, and they often get injured as they try and build up their bodies to get used to the six-month grind of the NBA. And \u2014 not unimportantly \u2014 the Suns play in the West. There are almost no easy marks. In fact, they\u2019re the easy mark. But Sarver and McDonough have to start owning this, too. So the guy with the .662 lifetime winning percentage, and who directly produced 16 world championship teams in a 29-year span, and after whom the Coach of the Year award is named, just outspent everyone for all those rings. Got it. From Anil Moni: You are aware that Wilt Chamberlain, not a Celtic and not Bill Russell, was the first person to make $100,000 in the NBA, right? In 1965? And that that is the reason why Russell demanded his salary for 1965 be \u2026 $100,001? And that every team in the league, including the Celtics, needed the gates of the Ice Capades and the Harlem Globetrotters in their buildings to survive financially? And that Auerbach didn\u2019t pay Sam Jones or K.C. Jones or Tom Heinsohn or Satch Sanders or anyone not named William Felton Russell big dollars? And that John Havlicek took half of what the ABA was offering him to jump in 1969 out of sheer dumb loyalty to Auerbach? But, I will relay your theory to Jerry West and Elgin Baylor and Oscar Robertson and Al Attles and Lenny Wilkens and Chet Walker and Bob Lanier and Bob McAdoo and Bernard King and Marques Johnson and some of the other people that tried and failed to beat Boston over those years Auerbach was in charge and report back to you.

If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! It\u2019s back! A weekly compilation of the top five candidates for the Maurice Podoloff Trophy. Weekly averages in parenthesis: 1) Giannis Antetokounmpo (38.3 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 5 apg; .672 FG, .750 FT): Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m feeling pretty, pretty good ( Larry David voice ) about the preseason Giannis MVP prediction. 2) Anthony Davis (34 ppg, 17.5 rpg, 1 bpg; .545 FG, .727 FT): Extreme Browage out of the gate. 3) James Harden (27.7 ppg, 4 rpg, 8.7 apg; .444 FG, .867 FT): Back to the Future for the Rockets with Chris Paul out indefinitely \u2014 \u201cThe Beard\u201d on the ball. 4) LeBron James (25 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 6.3 apg; .600 FG, .917 FT):  Still causing poor Kyrie Irving all kinds of agita . 5) John Wall (27 ppg, 4 rpg, 9 apg; .450 FG, .850 FT): Calling his 2017-18 campaign the \u201cwolf season.\u201d Which is\u2026fine. 17 \u2014 Consecutive games the Magic had lost to Cleveland before breaking the streak Saturday in a surprisingly dominant 114-93 road win at the Q. Orlando\u2019s losing streak even predated LeBron James\u2019s return to Cleveland; the Magic\u2019s last win over the Cavs was on Nov. 23, 2012. And Orlando\u2019s 37-game lead over the Cavs in the fourth quarter marked just the second time since 2012 that a team was up by 37 points on Cleveland; Golden State accomplished the feat on Jan. 18, 2016. 828 \u2014 Career games for newly signed Pelicans guard Jameer Nelson, picked up by New Orleans after Denver waived the 35-year-old guard last week. 6-7.23 \u2014 Average height of a player in the NBA this season, per the league\u2019s annual roster survey, released Friday. According to the league\u2019s calculations, the average NBA player weighs 220.45 pounds, is 26.56 years old and has played 4.77 years in the league. The player that most resembles those averages, according to the league, is Milwaukee forward Tony Snell. 1) Eric Bledsoe to the Knicks . Courtney Lee to the Sixers; Jerryd Bayless to the Suns. Jahlil Okafor to Phoenix. Does this not make sense for everyone involved? 2) I would completely back Mark Cuban\u2019s Lottery proposal that, unfortunately, he didn\u2019t officially put on the table for the league\u2019s Board of Governors at its meeting last month. \u201cWorst and You\u2019re Third\u201d is a great anti-tanking solution, and frankly, it\u2019s better than the one that Cuban actually did propose. Owners are never going to get rid of the Draft because the Rookie Scale artificially depresses salaries for so long; if you get an impact player right away, you basically get at least close to half of his playing prime for sub-market value. That\u2019s a return on investment that is too good to give back. But the notion that finishing with the worst record is not only of no value, but will end up hurting your chances in the Draft is a great idea. It could potentially change everything; instead of bad teams giving away their best players at the trade deadline to enhance their odds of finishing last, bad teams might actually become buyers and try to make a playoff run. And there\u2019s absolutely no downside to that for anyone. 3) Grindfather , getting me all up in my feelings. 4) Marshawn Lynch, American Treasure . 1) It\u2019s so awful when a player\u2019s season ends before it really begins. You remember when it happens \u2014 Nene in 2005, Julius Randle in 2015. And we\u2019ll unfortunately remember this awful first week of the season, when Gordon Hayward and Jeremy Lin went down with horrific season-ending injuries in Game 1. 2) I can tell you that the Warriors love them some Jordan Bell. Which, again, makes the Bulls\u2019 decision to agree to trade his rights to the Warriors on Draft night beyond perplexing. Chicago isn\u2019t exactly lousy with talent these days, and the franchise is among the most profitable in the league; as I said in June, the Bulls didn\u2019t need the $3.5 million they got from Golden State in the deal. Didn\u2019t make sense then; doesn\u2019t make sense now. 3) Not sure what the deal is with Markelle Fultz\u2019s shoulder,  but the free throw form \u2026 yikes . * * * MORE MORNING TIP: Kerr willing to speak out \u2014 and listen | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Q&A: Avery Bradley * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

And for the Boston Celtics, it did so less than six minutes into the season. Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury (in addition to being heartbreaking) essentially changes much of what the Boston Celtics were trying to do offensively this season. They\u2019ve lost one of their two primary ball-handlers, one of their best perimeter shooters, and probably their best decision-maker. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to stay within somewhat of the base we put in,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Friday in Philadelphia, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to have to do some significant tweaks with what we\u2019re emphasizing.\u201d Al Horford has to take on a bigger role in the offense. After Friday\u2019s win, Stevens called Horford\u2019s 16 shots (after 18 total in the first two games) \u201ca good step in the right direction.\u201d And Horford won\u2019t be the only Celtic asked to make plays out of the post. \u201cWe\u2019ll look to play through the post a little bit more at a bunch of different positions,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll look to get Kyrie off [the ball] and then back to it. It\u2019ll be something that hopefully we\u2019ll get better at as the season goes along, but there are some things we need to tweak to be the best that we can be.\u201d For every team, whether they go through significant injuries or not, the season is a continuous evolution on both ends of the floor. The Celtics\u2019 offense can\u2019t undergo a complete overhaul right away, but it will surely look much different in February and March than it does now. \u201cI imagined that any ways,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cbut now I really imagine that.\u201d Some teams are off to a great start and some need more tweaks than others. * * * Pace : Possessions per 48 minutes (League Rank) OffRtg : Points scored per 100 possessions (League Rank) DefRtg : Points allowed per 100 possessions (League Rank) NetRtg : Point differential per 100 possessions (League Rank) The league has averaged 102.7 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes and 103.6 points scored per 100 possessions this season. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings, released every Monday during the season, are just one man\u2019s opinion.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * Wiggins. Westbrook. Towns. Carmelo. Wiggins. The final 37 seconds of play between Oklahoma City and Minnesota on Sunday night featured the kind of star-powered drama the best regular season games contain. Big shot after big shot was made, each one trumping the last until, as is fitting, the last word won the day. Andrew Wiggins made sure he had that last say, burying a 3-pointer well behind the top of the arc as time expired to give the Timberwolves a dramatic 115-113 victory over the star-studded Thunder. The fourth-year forward capped off the kind of all-around night that his potential promised when he was drafted No. 1 overall in 2014, finishing with 27 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two steals in 39 minutes of play. It\u2019s the final play that will be remembered most, however, and it was one that could signal to the rest of the NBA\u2019s elite that Wiggins has arrived. DIFFICULTY: Wiggins had to take the ball on the run from the backcourt, as Minnesota had no timeouts after Carmelo Anthony\u2019s clutch 3-pointer put the Thunder up by one with 4.7 seconds remaining. A big assist goes to Karl-Anthony Towns, whose physical screen took Paul George out of the defensive equation long enough for Wiggins to get a clear north-south running start in the dead-center portion of the court. Two Thunder defenders closed in, but Wiggins still had plenty of daylight to get the shot off. That being said, pulling up on a dime from 30 feet out and using glass is no mean feat. The real question is, did he call bank? We\u2019re guessing not. GAME SITUATION: It says something big about Wiggins that he went toe-to-toe with far more established clutch-time performers in the game\u2019s final minute. Watching Westbrook and Anthony plunge daggers into his team only to say, \u201cI\u2019ll raise you,\u201d says a lot about Wiggins\u2019 potential to carry a team when it\u2019s needed. Don\u2019t forget, this was at Oklahoma City, one of the toughest places to play in the league. Minnesota\u2019s young forward deserves a lot of credit not just for making the shot, but for acting decisively in the time and situation he was facing. CELEBRATION: Wiggins was the hero, but this was a team win. Towns and Taj Gibson each finished with big double-doubles, while Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague also stuffed the stat sheet and made big play after big play. Wiggins lets out a gutteral roar and a low fist pump before immediately embracing Gibson at midcourt, where they\u2019re joined by an immediate mosh pit of teammates and coaches. This was a big win for a young team hoping to take a big step, and that couldn\u2019t have been more evident in the way they celebrated the victory. GRADE: It\u2019s game three of the regular season, so the Thunder will likely be over this by the time the calendar flips to 2018. For Minnesota, however, it\u2019s the kind of victory that could inject some tangible belief into the promise this season held for them. Towns put up historic numbers last season, and Butler was the team\u2019s marquee offseason acquisition. Wiggins was the big x-factor, one on which the Timberwolves gambled by signing him to a maximum multi-year extension less than two weeks ago. Give the kid credit for rewarding that faith with the biggest shot of his career in a quality Western Conference matchup. Three-and-a-half Horrys .

The Suns announced the firing Sunday night after hours of meetings at the team\u2019s headquarters. Assistant coach Jay Triano, a former head coach of the Toronto Raptors, was named interim coach. Triano was an assistant at Portland before coming to Phoenix last year. Watson was promoted from assistant to interim coach of the Suns after Jeff Hornacek was fired Feb. 1, 2016. The interim tag was removed on April 19 of that year. With an extremely young team, the Suns struggled under Watson. He compiled a 33-85 record. Watson\u2019s only full season was 2016-17, when the team went 24-58. The 38-year-old Watson played collegiately at UCLA and in the NBA for 10 seasons. He often spoke of his long talks with John Wooden, emphasized togetherness and a family atmosphere to nurture the young squad but wins were hard to come by. And owner Robert Sarver apparently didn\u2019t like what he saw. Phoenix is 0-3 and two of the losses were especially ugly. The Suns were blown out 124-76 by the Portland in their season opener Wednesday night, the most one-sided loss in franchise history and the most one-sided season opener for any NBA team. Phoenix was routed by the Clippers in Los Angeles 130-88 on Saturday night. \u201cI Dont wanna be here,\u201d point guard Eric Bledsoe tweeted Sunday, just as the news of Watson\u2019s firing surfaced in an ESPN report. The tweet by Bledsoe, a former Clipper, was followed by one from the Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan saying \u201cCome back home bro.\u201d Bledsoe has been rumored in possible trades for months. Watson\u2019s dismissal is the first NBA coaching change in well over a year. Hornacek\u2019s hiring by the New York Knicks, which was finalized in June 2016, had been the most recent change \u2013 and the irony there is that Watson got the job in Phoenix with 33 games left in the 2015-16 season, after the Suns fired Hornacek. Watson was the league\u2019s second-youngest active coach behind the Lakers\u2019 Luke Walton, and the Suns were tied with the Chicago Bulls as having the youngest opening-night roster in the NBA this season. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the fight be a little bit more,\u201d Watson said after the blowout loss to the Clippers. \u201cOr a lot more, until you know they\u2019re just fatigued.\u201d The Suns came into this season with only four losses by 40 or more points in franchise history. They\u2019ve had two in the first three games of this season. Phoenix has not made the playoffs in seven years, the longest drought in the franchise\u2019s 49-year history. Watson was the 17th Suns coach in the franchise\u2019s history. This was the first NBA season where every coach who started one year had the same job to begin the next. Per Elias, the Suns making a coaching change just three games into the season is tied for the second earliest coaching change in NBA history \u200e Fewest games into a season before a head coaching change: 1971-72: Buffalo Braves fired Dolph Schayes after 1 game. 2017-18: Phoenix Suns fired Earl Watson after 3 games. 1952-53: Baltimore Bullets fired Chick Reiser after 3 games."},{"id":43612,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-kyrie-irving-fined","date":"2017-10-22","title":"Boston Celtics' Kyrie Irving fined $25,000 for using inappropriate language toward fan","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving has been fined $25,000 for using inappropriate language when responding to a fan, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

It doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. Crawford, who retired this summer after working Game 5 of the Finals between Cleveland and Golden State in Oakland, spends his time now reconnecting with old friends. They go to movies together in the suburban Chicagoland, and he meets up with different ones for breakfast a couple times a month. And yet he\u2019s more fit now? \u201cI weigh less than I did when I got hired by the NBA 32 years ago,\u201d Crawford said at halftime Saturday of the San Antonio-Chicago game at United Center. He had been honored with a video tribute during a timeout in the first quarter, and was acknowledged by the crowd when he was introduced on the court with his family and some NBA executives. \u201cThe reason why, I\u2019m not spending all that dead time in hotel rooms and eating hotel food and eating at different times of the day. I\u2019m on a better schedule now. Working out every morning, dabbling in the stock market and eating dinner at 5:30. I\u2019ve got a routine going now and it\u2019s really a wonderful thing. I can get to 12 o\u2019clock every day with no problem at all. My goal is, what do I do between 12 and 5?\u201d Such is life for the retired. Crawford, who worked more than 2,000 regular season games, more than 300 NBA playoff games and in 23 consecutive Finals after being hired in 1985-86, left one year after Joey Crawford, who ended his 39-year stint in 2016. That makes this the first Crawford-less season, in terms of the whistleblowers, since 1976. As the league did for Joey and Bennett Salvatore when they called it quits, the NBA worked with teams in the referees\u2019 home market to stage a tribute. A video showed clips of Crawford working and interacting with some of the game\u2019s biggest stars. A bespectacled Crawford, looking studious, was joined front-and-center by his wife Claudia and daughter Lia (son Drew, who played at Northwestern, has been playing overseas). Also on the court with him: Bob Delaney, longtime NBA ref and until recently a VP for referee development and performance; Mike Bantom, NBA head of referee operations from 2012 to 2017; and Joe Borgia, senior VP of replay and referee operations. Of the respectful applause Crawford got at the end of the brief ceremony, Crawford laughed and said, \u201cAll of a sudden they love you. \u2026 I never won a game but it was always my fault.\u201d Before Crawford left the floor, Spurs coached Gregg Popovich waved him over for a handshake and a hug, exchanging \u2013 no, really, unlike many of their other conversations \u2013 a few pleasantries. Now that Crawford was a civilian, might Pop have a story or two he could share? \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s booted me before \u2013 of course I deserved it \u2013 but he\u2019s always been a class act,\u201d said the San Antonio coach, known for getting a little combustible on the sideline. \u201cSomebody who had great judgment and also a great demeanor. He knew how to handle coaches, when to tell you to go sit down, when to talk to you and not talk to you. Losing guys like him hurts, because it takes young referees a while to get as comfortable in their own skin as Danny did, for sure.\u201d Spurs veteran Pau Gasol explained why Crawford was considered one of the best and most respected game official during his run: \u201cHe always kept his composure. He was very approachable. He handled the emotions really well, not just from himself but also the players. Always, he just kept his poise. He might miss a call like anyone else, but he would tell you why he called what he called. It\u2019s an intense game, for the referees too, but he was never out of line. He was an example, I think, for a lot of younger referees.\u201d Of course, refs are refs, something some players never let them forget. Consider Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s teasing him when he learned in August that Crawford was leaving. O\u2019Neal arrived six seasons after Crawford and retired six seasons before him, which made the ref\u2019s life a little easier down the stretch.  \u201cI think the game is an easier game to referee, because it\u2019s a jump-shot shooting league now,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cRefereeing Shaq, Karl Malone, Buck Williams in the post, that would test your officiating ability. All the contact and deciding when to call a foul, when not to call a foul. \u201cNow a jump shooter either gets hit on the arm or the defender walks underneath him. It\u2019s easier to referee. But it\u2019s tougher in terms of the pace. One of the reasons I left was, the players are getting younger and faster and I\u2019m going in the opposite direction. The pace is unbelievable.\u201d Crawford cited the dead time between games on the road and the 22 or 23 nights each month during the season he was away from home and family as reasons for tapping out. He didn\u2019t blame the scrutiny that NBA referees face, both unofficially from fans and officially in league reviews, instant replay and last-two-minute reports. But he admitted that\u2019s tough and getting tougher. \u201cDo we make mistakes? Yes,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeking perfection, which is OK. But Danny Crawford, 32-year-vet, can tell you: \u2018They will not find perfection.\u2019 \u201cI understand the data and the analytics and the technology, that\u2019s where we are in this day and age. But from an officiating standpoint, you can only squeeze so much out of that lemon. I believe that what you\u2019re seeing now [in accuracy] is what you\u2019ll be seeing 10 years from now.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Embiid was in the starting lineup for the home opener Friday night against Boston. Embiid, the wildly talented and oft-injured 7-foot center, has yet to play in consecutive games over his brief NBA career. Embiid missed his first two seasons because of surgeries on his right foot and played only 31 games last year before he was shut down after surgery on his left knee. The Sixers kept Embiid on a tight minutes restriction last season that dominated the season. Embiid was told his minutes in the season opener this week at Washington would be limited to the teens but instead he has 18 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes. He said he expected to eventually play in both ends of one of Philadelphia\u2019s 14 sets of consecutive games (down from 18 last year). \u201cI just want to feel like an NBA player,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not an NBA player because I can\u2019t play back-to-back.\u201d Embiid is certainly paid like an NBA player \u2013 more like, an NBA superstar. Embiid, the No. 3 overall pick of the 2014 draft, signed a $148 million, five-year contract extension in the preseason. There\u2019s little cause-and-effect in Embiid\u2019s situation; if he sits out one game, he doesn\u2019t get to play more minutes in the other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how my body feels on the court. If I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve got to get out.\u201d Embiid hasn\u2019t complained much about his use, saying, \u201cthere\u2019s a plan in place and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to follow.\u201d Does the former Kansas star feel ready to go in two straight? \u201cI think I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the NBA, I never played back-to-back. I can\u2019t really say.\u201d The Sixers want Embiid to play around 20 minutes against the Celtics. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid thing,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cIt is a range more than it is a rigid number. I think we\u2019re going to have this conversation for a while.\u201d Brown said he does not have final say in deciding Embiid\u2019s minutes total. Brown said before Embiid spoke that Saturday\u2019s decision was not yet decided. The Sixers hired C. Daniel Medina Leal away from Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona and put him in charge of athlete care. The Sixers have made Embiid the centerpiece of a lengthy rebuilding effort dubbed \u201cThe Process,\u201d and fan enthusiasm leading into the opener was as high as it has been since the Allen Iverson era. The Wells Fargo Center was sold out and fans tailgated in the parking lot hours before tipoff, giving it a Philadelphia Eagles feel. \u201cI was like, what is this? Is this a football game,\u201d Embiid asked, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something going. We\u2019ve got to keep on going and win some games.\u201d Philly won\u2019t win many without Embiid. Embiid\u2019s career has been riddled with injuries dating to his college career at Kansas and all three seasons with the Sixers. Embiid played only 31 games last season and had minor surgery in March to repair a torn meniscus in his knee. He averaged 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds last season. \u201cI want to get in there and jump in the stands and dive for every loose ball,\u201d Embiid said."},{"id":43635,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/detroit-pistons-stan-van-gundy-speaks-out-again-support-protesting-athletes","date":"2017-10-20","title":"Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy speaks out again in support of protesting athletes","content":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy used his team\u2019s trip to Washington to again voice his support for athletes who kneel during the national anthem and his opposition to President Donald Trump. Van Gundy was asked before Friday night\u2019s game against the Wizards what he hoped would result from the president\u2019s criticism of NFL players who refuse to stand for the anthem and the resulting national dialogue about political activism by professional athletes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what good can come out of anything the president has said,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cAs far as the athletes\u2019 protest, I hope people would pay attention to the issues that caused the protest in the first place and realize that we have problem disproportionately with police brutality towards men of color.\u201d Van Gundy also criticized fans who have booed those athletes because they believe the gesture is disrespectful to the United States military. \u201cI thought that one of the things the military is fighting for is the American way of life and our values, which I think starts with freedom of speech,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cOur country was founded on protest. Otherwise, we would still be a colony of England. You would think people would appreciate non-violent protests that will be made. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stand for freedom of speech and you don\u2019t think those players have the right to freedom of speech, what American values are you for?\u201d It was not the first time Van Gundy has spoken out on these issues. When Trump was elected last November, Van Gundy told the Detroit Free Press it was the first time he had been \u201cashamed\u201d of his country. Last month on the team\u2019s media day, he read a prepared statement in support of athletes who use their visibility for political purposes, including protests during the anthem. The NBA has a policy requiring that players stand for the anthem.

For the first time, he did so as a visitor. The Twin Cities were Rubio\u2019s home away from home for the first six seasons of his NBA career, and the unexpected bond that formed between a Spanish point guard and a cold Midwestern city was one of the few endearing qualities to cling to during a downtrodden period in the franchise\u2019s history. \u201cLast night, I was walking around the city and I felt like I never left,\u201d Rubio said Friday before his Utah Jazz faced the Timberwolves. \u201cA lot of fans and a lot of friends here.\u201d The Timberwolves traded Rubio to Utah in July to clear room to sign free agent Jeff Teague, a scoring point guard who better fits coach Tom Thibodeau\u2019s offensive system. So ended the fan favorite\u2019s six-year run with the team that drafted him in 2009, waited two years for him to agree to come over from Spain and at one time believed he would eventually become the face of the franchise. That never happened, and a promising pairing with Kevin Love dissolved as well. But Rubio\u2019s work in the community, his infectious optimism and those unparalleled no-look passes left many a fan disappointed when he was shipped away. \u201cThey were amazing when I was here and they\u2019re still amazing,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSince the first day I came to the airport and get out of the gates, I started feeling the love. It\u2019s amazing having that feeling. I appreciate it.\u201d \u201cRicky\u2019s definitely the first one to make me feel comfortable in Minnesota,\u201d Wolves center Karl-Anthony Towns said. \u201cRight after I was drafted he was taking me out to dinners and lunches, making sure I was comfortable, showing me around Minnesota. \u201cBeing able to play with him was a huge honor. I became a smarter player and learned a lot from him.\u201d A torn ACL short-circuited an electric rookie season and the Wolves never were able to sniff the playoffs during Rubio\u2019s time here. Thibodeau was brought in last summer to expedite the latest in a long line of rebuilding plans, and the coach and the point guard never seemed to be able to get on the same page. Thibodeau wanted a more consistent and accomplished shooter to run his offense, spread the floor and take some of the scoring pressure off of Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Rubio wanted a more open line of communication with a coach who also holds the role of president of basketball operations and is known for his all-business approach. So when the Wolves concluded the season with a 31-51 record, missing the playoffs for the 13th consecutive season, it was clear that something had to give. Rubio was tired of hearing his name come up in trade rumors and let the organization know that he would welcome a move. The Wolves sent him to Utah for a future first-round draft pick, then signed Teague to a three-year, $57 million contract to take over the offense. Jazz GM Dennis Lindsey and coach Quin Snyder have taken pains to make Rubio feel included in the conversations that surround the team. \u201cThey were amazing from Day 1,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been texting me, emailing me, calling me almost every week through the process all summer long. Since I came here to Utah, it was amazing having that feeling, that connection and knowing they really are on the same page.\u201d When Gordon Hayward chose to leave for Boston in free agency, Rubio became even more important as a pass-first point guard who gets everyone involved. \u201cHe\u2019s been aggressive,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cHe\u2019s capable of making plays defensively. There\u2019s not a whole lot we didn\u2019t know. The passing is something that we saw and is as good as advertised.\u201d Rubio had nine points, 10 assists and five rebounds in his debut with the Jazz, a comeback victory over Denver on Wednesday. It was a decidedly Rubio performance, short on shooting and long on playmaking. Fans showing up to Target Center on Friday night to see their point guard will recognize his game but not much else. He has a full, thick beard, long hair that he ties up in a man-bun and a tattoo sleeve on his right arm. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a much more mature player, more confidence,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different Ricky.\u201d"},{"id":43628,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/atlanta-hawks-f-deandre-bembry-has-fractured-right-wrist","date":"2017-10-20","title":"Atlanta Hawks F DeAndre' Bembry out with fractured right wrist","content":"CHARLOTTE, N.C.

He had grown up in Lagos, Nigeria, a contemporary of Hakeem Olajuwon, whose soccer moves became part of a dreamy repertoire that helped Olajuwon earn two NBA championships and eventually a spot in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Charles and his wife, Veronica, moved in 1991 from Lagos to Athens, Greece, as part of a wave of immigrants seeking better lives. They left their son, Francis, with his grandparents, then gave birth to and raised four more boys: Thanasis, Giannis, Kostas and Alexandros. Times were tough in Sepolia, the neighborhood where the family lived, and as the economy grew worse, Greek citizens looked for somebody to blame. First up, the immigrants. Charles and Veronica struggled to find steady work, which made it tough to put food on the table and tougher still to keep a roof over their heads. The couple labored where they could, picking oranges, selling beads and purses on street corners, some babysitting for her, random handyman jobs for him. \u201cHe just wanted us to be happy. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, to be honest with you,\u201d said Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 young star. \u201cHe never cared about nothing else. No material stuff. I tried to buy my parents a car last year. He told me, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want one.\u2019 He never asked for nothing. He was just happy seeing me at All-Star, seeing my older brother [Thanasis] play for the Euro championship, seeing my younger brothers growing up. He was just full of joy.\u201d Basketball fans want to know more every day about Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee\u2019s lanky, do-everything forward and a trendy pick for this season\u2019s Kia Most Valuable Player award. But Giannis wants you to know about Charles, who died suddenly of a heart attack Sept. 29 at the family home in Milwaukee . He was only 54 years old. \u201cThere was never a day in my life that I called him and he wasn\u2019t there for me,\u201d said Giannis, 22. \u201cI could be sitting on the couch being lazy and then I\u2019d ask him to get me some food. And he\u2019d always be, \u2018Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u2019 Always at the game, never missed a game since the day that he came here. And he was happy. Really happy. For all of the kids.\u201d Eight months after the Bucks\u2019 then-general manager John Hammond selected Antetokounmpo with the No. 15 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft \u2014 he\u2019d likely go No. 1 now within that class \u2014 Charles and Veronica moved to Milwaukee with their two youngest sons (Alex still is a student-athlete at a Milwaukee high school, while Kostas was a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton recovering from a summer leg injury) to be with Giannis. Barely two years later, when he signed a four-year, $100 million contract extension in September 2016 , he talked of the security it assured them all, how free they were from worry. \u201cThe way we started and where we are right now, it\u2019s great,\u201d he said. One year after that, their father and Veronica\u2019s husband was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. Losing someone you love is tough,\u201d Giannis said, staying late as the Bucks\u2019 locker room emptied after a preseason victory over Detroit just two weeks after Charles\u2019 death. \u201cLosing someone who\u2019s been there since Day 1. Especially for our family, because we\u2019re so close.\u201d The Bucks cut him loose immediately, giving Antetokounmpo all the time he needed to deal with the loss. He missed the team\u2019s first preseason game, but unbeknownst to the public, actually was showing up at their new practice facility, getting work in, staying close. \u201cDay by day, we\u2019re getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be sad. We loved our dad. My mom loved her husband. But at the end of the day, I think, he did what he was supposed to do in this world. He had five kids and raised us right. That\u2019s the most important thing. \u201cI hope one day when I leave this world too that I can leave to my kids the impact that my dad is leaving now.\u201d Antetokounmpo would settle for that, yet he has a chance to touch lives and inspire strangers well beyond his father\u2019s reach. Beginning his fifth NBA season, he has gone from \u201cthe Greek Freak\u201d whose improbable bundle of length and skills produced one or two \u201cdid-you-see-that?\u201d highlights each game to a franchise player who unofficially looms as the league\u2019s Next Big Thing. His rapid development from an 18-year-old rookie who averaged 6.8 points on 41.4 percent shooting in 2013-14 turned him last season into the first player in NBA history to rank in the top 20 in total points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals . He joined just four others who ever led their teams, over a full season, in those five categories on a per-game basis. Antetokounmpo was voted an All-Star starter , was named to the all-NBA and all-defensive second teams and earned the 2016-17 Kia Most Improved Player Award . No longer the skinny 6-foot-9 teen with pipe-cleaner arms, Antetokounmpo stands a skosh under 7-feet, with a barrel chest and a ripped upper body. He has added strength, too, to his base, though he still looks coltish zig-zagging downcourt in long, frenetic strides. At full tilt, he can spring from midcourt to either baseline in about five steps. \u201cRight now he\u2019s gotten better at everything,\u201d teammate Malcolm Brogdon said. \u201cShooting. His passing\u2019s improved. His ball handling. His finishing at the rim \u2013 instead of dunking everything, he\u2019s finishing high off the glass. \u2026 When you\u2019re running next to a guy who\u2019s about to lay it up in transition, you just get out of the way because you know Giannis is coming to block it.\u201d Antetokounmpo\u2019s length, wingspan and vertical leap produce plays that appear to defy physics. He can soar like Julius Erving and, with massive hands to manipulate the ball, he throws down drive-by dunks reminiscent of Hall of Famer Connie Hawkins . The book on Antetokounmpo, for those unfortunates charged with defending him, has focused on his strength and his shooting. But he addressed the former again this summer, while improving little by little at the latter (his effective field-goal percentage has ticked up from 46.3 as a rookie  to 54.1 last season , thanks mostly to his 2-point accuracy). \u201cThere wasn\u2019t something specific I worked on,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI got a little bit stronger. I changed my diet. No sugar. No fast food. Just eating five times a day, every two to three hours. High protein. A lot of nasty food that doesn\u2019t taste good but I\u2019ve just got to eat it because it\u2019s good for my body. Yogurts. Coconut milk.\u201d It\u2019s one thing for fans and media folks to drool over Antetokounmpo\u2019s remarkable feats and vast potential but quite another for coaches and especially fellow players to do the same. Yet there was Lakers legend Kobe Bryant over the summer, challenging the Bucks player to become MVP . And only a few days ago, Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant chimed in with the stunning suggestion that this kid could become the best player (gulp) in NBA history . \u201cThe Greek Freak, I think, is a force. I\u2019ve never seen anything like him,\u201d Durant said on his YouTube channel. \u201cHe could end up being the best player to ever play if he really wanted to. That\u2019s pretty scary to think about. He\u2019s by far my most favorite player to watch.\u201d When that outrageous notion was relayed to Antetokounmpo, the enormity of it hit him hard. \u201cOoof! Ooof!\u201d he said, bringing a hand up to his mouth and looking a bit embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s a big compliment. But I\u2019ve got a long way to go. The only thing I can do is keep working hard. But listening to that, a compliment from a great player as KD, what can I say? It\u2019s big-time.\u201d Antetokounmpo wasn\u2019t inclined to delve too deeply into the front end of that suggestion. But the \u201cif he really wanted to\u201d qualifier was unnecessary, he said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be, I wouldn\u2019t even talk about it. I wouldn\u2019t even try,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d probably hide behind the scenes. To e one of the best to ever play the game? I think I have the ability to do that. But I\u2019ve got to work hard. If I just keep talking and don\u2019t put some work in, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d So much goes into Greatest of All Time status, from All-Star selections and annual awards to stats titles, with championships weighing especially heavy in the NBA. It\u2019s hardly worth discussing, given Antetokounmpo\u2019s absence of individual hardware and team accolades. Then again, he has discussed requirements he\u2019ll face if he wants to be the league\u2019s best player this season. And next. And the one after that. \u201cIt definitely can happen,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cBut the most important thing is, I\u2019ll try to help my team win. I think MVP will take care of itself. It might not be this year, it might not be next year, but I know eventually we\u2019re going to be a winning team as we get older and get better. It\u2019s gonna come.\u201d In Antetokounmpo\u2019s time in Milwaukee, the Bucks went 15-67 when he was a rookie. Over the next three seasons, they went 116-130 with first-round exits against the Chicago Bulls (2015) and Toronto Raptors (2017) . Against the Raptors, he averaged 24.8 points, 9.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 2.2 steals, 1.7 blocks and 40.5 minutes in six games. \u201cJust got to be mentally tough and do whatever it takes for a team to win,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to act like [winners] when you\u2019re out there playing. It doesn\u2019t matter how you\u2019re playing, you\u2019ve got to be vocal, you\u2019ve got to be aggressive, if you really want to be one of the best in this league.\u201d Sean Sweeney, the Bucks\u2019 youthful assistant coach who has taken on a mentor\/confidante role with Antetokounmpo, works individually with him all season long. Each summer, he travels to Greece, California and back to Wisconsin for sessions both physical and mental. Sweeney has become, in the player\u2019s words, \u201clike having a big brother on the team.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve talked to him about greatness and what that means. Why not? Why wouldn\u2019t you go for that if you were him?\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cNow the component for him that\u2019s huge, just like any young player, is how do you establish yourself within your team that coincides with winning? That\u2019s a huge step.\u201d The Bucks\u2019 and Antetokounmpo\u2019s agendas synched up nicely in their opener in Boston Wednesday, when he got 37 points with 13 rebounds in Milwaukee\u2019s 108-10o victory. Said Celtics coach Brad Stevens: \u201cYou saw the way Giannis played. \u2026 You thought, \u2018That\u2019s an MVP candidate, for sure.\u2019\u201d The Bucks are going to want to hit the \u201cV\u201d in that hard and wring every bit of value out of their versatile young star. With Jabari Parker again on rehab island, working back from his second ACL surgery , and with a limited number of reliable perimeter shooters, Antetokounmpo\u2019s ability to attack the rim and either finish or kick to Khris Middleton, Tony Snell or Matthew Dellavedova in space is essential. So, too, the Bucks need Giannis to transition from \u201cleading by example\u201d to leading in more overt, intentional ways. He\u2019s the closest thing to a constant now in Milwaukee, second in tenure to backup big man John Henson not just in the locker room but in the coaches\u2019 offices and in the executive suites. No fan of change, Antetokounmpo at least is grateful the Bucks top the league in percentage of players returned from last season. That should make him comfortable speaking up more. \u201cHe\u2019s taking more of a leadership role,\u201d said Bucks point guard Malcolm Brogdon, the 2017 Kia Rookie of the Year. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s taking his craft even more seriously now. There\u2019s a new level of focus. His dedication has always been there, his focus has been there. But his confidence has gone to another level this year.\u201d Leading his team might be just a variation on leading his family, a task that has grown with his father\u2019s passing but one Antetokounmpo initially embraced at an early age. As a boy, he and Thanasis sold sunglasses and tote bags on the streets of Athens . They hustled to bring home cash to supplement Charles\u2019 and Veronica\u2019s spotty paychecks. \u201cI\u2019ve been a leader since I was 12 for my family,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cSo it\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s not hard if you want to do it. I had to take care of my mom and take care of my brothers since I can remember. It\u2019s easy for me. They know that I love being there for them, and whatever they need, I\u2019m there. They know that.\u201d  The family was there for each other late last month when Charles died, \u201cthere\u201d being the practice courts of the Bucks\u2019 new facility in downtown Milwaukee. That evening, racked by grief, the Antetokounmpos sought refuge there. They came together to lean on the game that had carried them this far, asking it to take them a little further. \u201cThe day my dad passed away, I \u2026 came to the court,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cMe and my whole family. We shot hoops. Even my mom. She is strong. She\u2019s a beast. \u201cBasketball has been that way since I\u2019ve been a little kid, y\u2019know. Something that makes me happy.

Conley, you see, was already a favorite son, the billboard face of a beloved basketball team and most importantly, able to immediately keep producing on a high level because of good health. The soaring salary cap, helped by bloated TV contracts, trickled down and lavished Conley and others with the same insanely great timing in free agency that year. One was Chandler Parsons, who leveraged a solid season in Dallas to score an instant jackpot with these same free-spending Grizzlies. They gave him roughly $94 million over four years , the most possible under the cap. Some NBA brows were arched, yet the reasons were clear-cut: Memphis needed scoring at small forward and Parsons, a good shooter and just 28, was available. And all it cost them was money instead of assets in a trade. That\u2019s where the link between Conley and Parsons ends. Parsons was an outsider who came to the Grizzlies off a second knee surgery. Then his first season in Memphis was interrupted twice, by a bone bruise and finally a meniscus tear. He averaged six points in 34 games for that $23 million he made. The guy the Grizzlies wanted him to replace, Vince Carter, had more giddyup at 40. This led to Wednesday\u2019s season opener, when some impatient home fans let Parsons have it after an uninspiring six-point debut that began with a pair of missed free throws. The short honeymoon was because Parsons lacks the advantage of tenure like Conley and Marc Gasol and he\u2019s coming off a washout season. Mainly, and this is the real issue, he cost Memphis some serious cheddar; if Parsons was getting by on $7 million a season he\u2019d be ignored because fans equate paychecks with performance. Frustrated and feeling betrayed, Parsons ripped back, describing their response as \u201ctasteless\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re athletes, we\u2019re human beings\u201d and how he\u2019ll treat home games like road games if that\u2019s what the fans want. Well, what they want is the old Parsons, a 6-10 big who could stretch the floor and shoot with range, who revved offenses in Houston and then Dallas, and who might be resting under a tombstone at this point. That\u2019s what Parsons wants, too, more than anyone, a fair chance to demonstrate that a summer of hard rehab work can lead to a rousing comeback and somehow justify the weight of that paycheck. Will he get that chance? \u201cMemphis invested in me four years and a lot of money so I want to show them that I\u2019m worth it and I can live up to that expectations they have for me and the expectations I have for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI have so much to prove. Before my injuries I was one of the better players in the league and on the right path to have a great career. I still have that chip on my shoulder that I can be that player.\u201d At his best prior to arriving in Memphis, he was a secondary scorer who could make threes and mid-range jumpers and help on the glass, a 15-point, five-rebound player whose J.Crew looks and good-guy personality allowed him to enjoy a measure of popularity in Houston and briefly in Dallas. More famously, he kept stumbling into money; Mark Cuban stole him from the Rockets with a three-year, $46 million offer sheet which was rather substantial for 2014, and then came the Memphis deal. Quite telling, both the Rockets and Mavericks passed on matching those enormous deals. And now, it\u2019s possible Parsons might put the Grizzlies in the position of buying him out next summer if he\u2019s nothing more than a backup forward who can\u2019t stay on the floor or hit the open jumper. It\u2019s not his fault that his body has betrayed him, and chronically injured players do get unfairly stigmatized and criticized for something beyond their control. That\u2019s why Parsons was upset at being booed. He didn\u2019t purposely wreck his knees or force the Grizzlies to give him a max contract. He did put in the work this summer precisely to avoid a relapse. At the Grizzlies\u2019 request, he went through drills with renown physical therapist John Meyer in Los Angeles; Meyer has worked with a number of pro athletes, Blake Griffin among them. Every fiber of Parsons\u2019 body was examined and strengthened in rehab and all the poking and prodding was new to him. \u201cJust doing different non-impact workouts,\u201d he said. \u201cI never done pilates in my life, never boxed, all these swimming workouts and cardio to keep me lean but not putting the pounding on my knees. I worked with Blake almost every day so it was cool to have a guy who went through the same struggles as I did. \u201cI never had to cancel a workout this summer because I was sore. I did that last season. I couldn\u2019t play back to back, had minutes restrictions. I\u2019m not naive. I know there will be some restrictions this season, but it\u2019s nice knowing that I\u2019m free and can just focus on basketball and not have to worry about my knees all the time.\u201d As anyone would, Parsons is understandably sensitive about missing so much time and dealing with expectations, given his contract, and feels a great debt to his teammates, especially Conley and Gasol. Both have supported him and even defended him from the opening night treatment. \u201cBooing Chandler is just like booing Mike or booing myself,\u201d said Gasol. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with it at all.\u201d Gasol and Conley are good soldiers who want and need to boost Parsons\u2019 confidence in order to get the max from him, because once again, the Grizzlies lack a killer at small forward, a problem area ever since they traded Rudy Gay. Also, coach David Fizdale is doing his part, sampling Parsons at power forward to help reinvent a team that using up-tempo and shooting to replace the grittiness it lost with Zach Randolph and Tony Allen gone. \u201cLook, the last three years basketball wise hasn\u2019t been too fun,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cNo one likes being hurt and although I do still have my days when I\u2019m extremely sore, I finally feel like I can do most things I usually could do. I\u2019m not thinking about my knees or my health when I\u2019m playing. Just to be able to be in the gym, be on the road and involved in everything again is a great feeling. Hopefully I can sustain this and keep it going the whole season.\u201d He\u2019s more optimistic than those who\u2019ve declared his contract the most poisonous in basketball and a burden on the Grizzlies and especially a thorn in the side of GM Chris Wallace, who signed him. Parsons has the support of the locker room and perhaps a segment of sympathetic Memphis fans, but professional sports doesn\u2019t wait long for anyone, regardless of the circumstances. In the quest to win games, bodies are thrown aside to find the right formula, and even Parsons is aware of how the system works. He can\u2019t have the opener back, but he will get as many cracks at redemption as his talent and body allows. What encourages Parsons is he feels his mechanics are as good as ever. That never went away, he claims; it just needs real-game reps. And about the tough road it took to arrive here? \u201cIt does challenge you,\u201d he said, \u201cand it will make it that much sweeter when I get back to where I was.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

He came up hobbling and grabbing at his knee, putting quite a scare into Golden State\u2019s faithful. The Warriors got some good news today, though, as an MRI of the knee sprain came back negative, reports ESPN.com\u2019s Chris Haynes : Anthony Slater of TheAthletic.com, Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle and Mark Medina of The Mercury News say Green is likely doubtful for Friday\u2019s road game against the New Orleans Pelicans . Omri Casspi\u2019s Warriors debut was cut short after he sprained his left ankle late in the third quarter. He had come into the game questionable with a mild sprain of his right ankle. Casspi did some shooting but didn\u2019t practice. \u201cHe just slipped on the floor,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he\u2019s OK. It was a tough break, he\u2019s sprained both ankles in the last week.\u201d Andre Iguodala, meanwhile, practiced Wednesday after missing the opener with a strained back. Kerr remains hopeful he will play on the road trip that includes the team\u2019s first back-to-back with Friday\u2019s matchup against the Pelicans followed by a game Saturday at Memphis. Golden State plays Monday at Dallas before returning home for three games next week. The Warriors are being extra cautious at this stage with Iguodala, who is such a valuable contributor off the bench. Kerr has said his team still must get in better shape \u2013 mentally and physically \u2013 and that led to foul trouble throughout the game. Kevin Durant\u2019s baseline jumper at the end went in just too late and Golden State squandered a big lead on the night it received its championship rings. The Warriors only spent about 30 minutes practicing on the court Wednesday with the focus on skill work, instead using more time to study film. \u201cWe were not ready mentally to play that game, even when we weren\u2019t tired,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhen I say we\u2019re not in great shape, I can\u2019t come in here today and run them because they\u2019re tired from last night.

The crowd that bought tickets to see him make his Boston debut chanted his name. A few miles away, Hayward was being wheeled into surgery to repair the ankle he mangled in the season opener. Hayward\u2019s agent said the surgery Wednesday night \u201cwent really well.\u201d Mark Bartelstein said Thursday that doctors \u201cgot everything sort of fixed and put back in the right place. So that\u2019s great. There\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ll get him back to be better than he was before. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind about that.\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said the situation is difficult for him personally, but Hayward will have lots of support. \u201cHaving known him as long as I\u2019ve known him, it\u2019s tough to see him go through this,\u201d said Stevens, who was also Hayward\u2019s college coach at Butler. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure he knows that we\u2019ve got our arms around him.\u201d After signing a four-year, $128-million free agent contract to come to Boston from the Utah Jazz, his only professional team, Hayward\u2019s Celtics career was less than six minutes old when an awkward landing in Cleveland on Tuesday night left him with a broken left tibia and dislocated ankle. Bartelstein didn\u2019t have details on a timeframe for Hayward\u2019s recovery. \u201cIt will be awhile,\u201d Bartelstein said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll play this season. But we\u2019re not even thinking about a timeframe right now.\u201d Players on both teams reacted in horror to Hayward\u2019s gruesomely bent leg. Stevens said he couldn\u2019t watch the replay. The Celtics, who trailed the Cavaliers by 16 at halftime, lost when Kyrie Irving missed the potential tying 3-pointer at the buzzer. Unable to attend the home opener against Milwaukee a night later, Hayward recorded a video message from his hospital bed before heading into surgery, telling Boston fans: \u201cIt\u2019s hurting me that I can\u2019t be there.\u201d In the 30-second message, which was also sent out by the team on Twitter, Hayward thanked the fans for all the messages of support. \u201cI\u2019m going to be all right,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting me that I can\u2019t be there for the home opener. I want nothing more than to be with my teammates and walk out on that floor tonight. But I\u2019ll be supporting you guys from here, and wishing you the best of luck.\u201d Boston fell to 0-2 when Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 16 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter, adding 13 rebounds to help the Milwaukee Bucks to a 108-100 victory. Irving scored 17 points for Boston on 7-for-25 shooting, and Jaylen Brown scored 18. Stevens said it\u2019s going to take them a little more time to figure this all out. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can find the right combinations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t anticipate going maybe this far into the bench this early.\u201d Hayward was expected to make a full recovery, but Stevens did not know if he would be able to return this season. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been tough,\u201d said rookie forward Jayson Tatum. \u201cWe\u2019re just keeping Gordon in our prayers, hoping everything is all right.\u201d Hayward\u2019s acquisition was part of a near-complete roster overhaul for the team that finished first in the East last season before losing to the Cavaliers in the conference finals. The team also traded fan favorite Isaiah Thomas to Cleveland for Irving and shipped out regular starters Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder. In all, just four players on the roster finished last season with the team. \u201cAs you saw in the Cleveland game, they fought back,\u201d Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to quit.\u201d"},{"id":48805,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/russell-westbrook-8-best-triple-doubles-2016-17-season","date":"2017-10-19","title":"Eight great Russell Westbrook triple-doubles from last season","content":"* Tonight on TNT:  Knicks vs. Thunder (8 ET) * Smith:  Westbrook refueled for another Kia MVP run Russell Westbrook\u2019s NBA-record 42 triple-doubles provided more raw data than can be analyzed in a condensed amount of time. While it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the number-crunching, it\u2019s even more fun to relive the moments from his magical Kia MVP season . Here are just a few (including his 43rd, a playoff triple-double) of the most memorable ones: The result?: 115-113 win vs. Houston Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  32 points (11-24 FG, 3-8 3-point FG), 12 rebounds, 11 assists Why it stood out: The Thunder\u2019s lone playoff win came on the back of, what else, a Westbrook triple-double. It was his third straight in the series and saved the Thunder from a sweep at the hands of James Harden and the Rockets. The result: 106-105 win vs. Denver Nuggets Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  50 points (17-32 FG, 5-12 3-point FG), 16 rebounds, 10 assists Why it stood out: Westbrook set the triple-double record and ended the Denver Nuggets\u2019 playoff dreams on the same night, nailing a 36-footer at the buzzer for the win. The result: 114-106 overtime win vs. Orlando Magic Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  57 points (21-40 FG, 6-15 3-point FG), 13 rebounds, 11 assists Why it stood out: Westbrook led the Thunder to their largest comeback in team history with the highest scoring triple-double in team history on the road in Orlando.

The result: 118-109 win vs. Cleveland Cavaliers Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  29 points (11-27 FG, 2-6 3-point FG), 12 rebounds, 11 assists Why it stood out: While the Cavaliers made headlines before the game because they were questions about coach Tyronn Lue resting LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, Westbrook led the ambush. (All three Cavs stars played, by the way.) The result: 117-112 win vs. Boston Celtics Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  45 points (13-25 FG, 5-7 3-point FG), 11 rebounds, 11 assists Why it stood out: In a stretch of three straight 40-point games , Westbrook dazzled in this win over Boston by scoring eight straight points to end the first half and the final 15 of the game, including two deep 3-pointers in the final 75 seconds to finish the Celtics off. The result: 114-101 win vs. Phoenix Suns Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  26 points (9-17 FG, 1-2 3-point FG), 11 rebounds, 22 assists Why it stood out: Who said Westbrook didn\u2019t trust his teammates? He piled up a career-high 22 assists to collect his 50th career triple-double against the Suns, willing the Thunder past another team with a force and energy the Magic couldn\u2019t match. The result: 126-115 win vs. Washington Wizards Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  35 points (12-35 FG, 1-6 3-point FG), 14 rebounds, 11 assists Why it stood out: On a rough shooting night (he started 7-for-28) Westbrook saved his best for last to turn back the John Wall, Bradley Beal and the Wizards.

The result: 113-110 OT win vs. Phoenix Suns Westbrook\u2019s stat line:  51 points (17-44 FG, 2-10 3-point FG), 13 rebounds, 10 assists Why it stood out: The triple-double that started it all. Westbrook posted the first 50-point triple-double the league had seen since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it in 1975. It was also the Thunder\u2019s (and Westbrook\u2019s) first home game without Kevin Durant on the roster. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Westbrook, the reigning Kia MVP , has been here before, Harden insists, a star serving as the connective tissue for two other stars. Harden, Westbrook and Kevin Durant were young guns in Oklahoma City six seasons ago , the bright core group of a franchise poised for years of title contention in the rugged Western Conference. They were the faces of a new generation and an organic super team in the making. Their post-practice shooting games were the stuff of legend, three young stars all bound for greatness. That trip they made to The Finals in 2012 , where they fell to the Miami Heat\u2019s star trio of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh was just the beginning. \u201cWe were all talented and we had that work ethic so we knew something positive would come out of that,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it would get to this level. I think all three of us are at the top and doing our own things individually and in our own way. But we knew it was something special.\u201d Special indeed. Fast forward to the start of this season. The Thunder open up tonight at home against the New York Knicks and the destinies of Durant, Westbrook and Harden have been fulfilled \u2026 albeit apart rather than together. Durant won a title with the Golden State Warriors in 2017, earning Finals MVP honors along the way. Westbrook averaged a triple-double ( the first time in 55 years that happened ) while breaking Oscar Robertson\u2019s single-season triple-doubles record (42) . Night after night, he was turning himself into a must-see attraction for fans everywhere. And Harden, the leader of a Houston Rockets team with designs on challenging the Warriors, finished as the runner-up to Westbrook in the MVP race . It\u2019s easy, then, for Harden to reflect on what his good friend Westbrook can do for an encore. \u201cDo it again,\u201d he said. \u201cGet back to the grind and do it again.\u201d That\u2019s easier said than done. \u201cCome on, numbers wise, guys just don\u2019t do this all the time,\u201d Boston Celtics center Al Horford said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t expect it and I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with not matching those numbers. I know LeBron does it every year, basically, and that\u2019s impressive in its own right. But I don\u2019t expect Russell to average a triple-double again. \u201cIf he is able to repeat anything close to that \u2026 it\u2019ll be crazy, absolutely crazy. Because that was a once-in-a-lifetime season.\u201d Navigating the balance with George and Anthony, developing the sort of chemistry he and Harden and Durant once enjoyed, is the top priority for Westbrook. And moving from the bottom half of the Western Conference playoff field in 2016-17 and into the air held by the Rockets, San Antonio Spurs and Warriors ranks ahead of any individual goals anyway. Sharing the load, the way he did earlier in his pre-MVP days, is the priority now. How that affects Westbrook\u2019s game remains to be seen. But make no mistake, it\u2019s on the minds of all involved. \u201cI say it all the time, I wanted to make this game easier for him,\u201d George said. \u201cUltimately, making him better at what he does is difficult to do for a guy that averages triple-doubles. I mean, how do you top that? But I think all of our games complement each other. And I don\u2019t want him at any point to feel the pressure that he has to do everything or that it\u2019s all on his shoulders.\u201d That feeling was inevitable last season, when Westbrook toiled for the first time without Durant, who preceded him in bringing MVP hardware to Oklahoma City in 2014 . Westbrook\u2019s MVP narrative started the day Durant left the Thunder for Golden State via free agency in 2016 . It gained steam with every breathtaking Westbrook performance, every triple-double that followed. By the time Westbrook\u2019s tank went empty, during a first-round playoff loss to Harden and the Rockets , two things were clear: Westbrook would soon claim that MVP, and operating as a one-man wrecking crew in today\u2019s NBA is not sustainable. Thunder GM Sam Presti set out to rectify the situation by trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis for George on July 6 and, later, engineering a trade for Anthony on the eve of training camp , sending Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a second-round draft pick to New York. \u201cSomething had to be done,\u201d said Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst Tracy McGrady, who knows a thing or two about trying to tote the load the way Westbrook did last season. \u201cYou do it because you\u2019re great, you love the game and you\u2019re never satisfied. And when you\u2019re built like that and you love to compete \u2026 you\u2019re young, hungry and ambitious, you want it all. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to do. It\u2019s hard to do what Russ did because he plays so (expletive) hard. Every single night he expends so much energy. That\u2019s not good for longevity. It\u2019s fun to watch, no doubt. Fans love it. We all love to see it. But it takes a toll on you. Its tough on the body to play that way every night. Trust me, it happened to me.\u201d With George and Anthony around to help share the responsibilities, McGrady said there is perfect opportunity for Westbrook to take a step back while improving at the same time. Thunder coach Billy Donovan will have more options to work with and Westbrook won\u2019t have to carry as heavy a burden as a scorer and playmaker. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any doubt it will be scaled back a little bit because he has other great players with him,\u201d McGrady said. \u201cHe had to do that last year. If he didn\u2019t, they don\u2019t win, point blank period. Once KD left, that was a big hole to fill, man. Oladipo couldn\u2019t fill it. I thought he was going to be better. I was disappointed in his play because he\u2019s talented as hell. I thought he would bring more. But Russ had to do that, he had to grind like that. Having Melo and PG with him changes everything.\u201d Westbrook and George in a pick and roll with Anthony waiting to shoot on the other side of the floor is a wrinkle the Thunder didn\u2019t have last season. Three elite players with the versatility to play all five positions allows the Thunder to match up and cause mismatches their personnel could not last season. It\u2019s enough for guys like Paul Pierce to bet on the Thunder as a legitimate championship contender this season, even with the Spurs, Warriors, Rockets, Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics on most people\u2019s lists. \u201cYou need minimum three All-Stars to win a championship,\u201d said Pierce, an analyst for ESPN, said on a Monday media conference call. \u201cWhat other team outside of OKC, Golden State, and maybe Cleveland can produce three All-Stars? So they have the criteria that you need to win a championship.\u201d Pierce was in the Westbrook role, of sorts, as the incumbent star in Boston, back when Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen arrived in Boston and led the Celtics to a championship in their first season together (2007-08) . He understands, probably better than most, what sort of sacrifices needed to be made for this to work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got guys that can play multiple positions,\u201d said Pierce, who spent the last few seasons of his career with the Nets, Wizards and Clippers. \u201cYou can put Russ at the two. You can put \u2018Melo at the three, four or five. You can also put George at the two, three, four. So they really have the versatility to match up with anybody in the NBA.\u201d What about fears that the chemistry between Westbrook, George and Anthony won\u2019t develop or happen so slowly they all recede into bad habits? All a waste of time, says Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale. \u201cBilly Donovan is a hell of a coach. He manages egos well, and that\u2019s going all the way back to his days at Florida with those championship teams he had,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cHe made it work with Russ and KD. It wasn\u2019t that it wasn\u2019t working with those guys. They took Golden State to the brink with that team. So let\u2019s be real about this. Once they figure out quickly that they can help each other and start sharing the game and not taking a step back as individuals, they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Donovan, for his part, has done his best to clear up any misconceptions about what drives Westbrook and how he plays the game. That\u2019s something his coaches, teammates and Thunder front office personnel have done without fail over the years. Westbrook\u2019s record usage rate last season was out of necessity and not necessarily about a guy playing to his stat-stuffing alter-ego, as some critics suggested. He did it all because he had to and the Thunder needed that from their lone star. \u201cClearly for us last year, somebody creating and generating a shot for himself or someone else, it was Russell,\u201d Donovan told ESPN. \u201cBut obviously now with Carmelo and Paul being here, I think it\u2019s about making the right play and right decision. \u201cRussell\u2019s never been like, \u2018Hey I want the ball, give me the ball.\u2019 He\u2019s never been that way. He\u2019s always trying to figure out what\u2019s best for the team and I\u2019ve always admired that and respect that as a coach.\u201d Whatever is said, what\u2019s done is what matters. And ultimately, the onus falls on Westbrook, now that he\u2019s ended the suspense about his future with the franchise by signing that five-year, $205 million extension . You don\u2019t want him to change, too much. You need to him to keep his edge, to keep that fire burning. \u201cIf you\u2019re Russ or any guy in that position, I think the only thing you can really focus on is winning,\u201d said Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley. \u201cJust win as much as you can. There\u2019s nothing else to prove individually. And I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s out to do, he\u2019s said as much. \u201cRuss will be the same player he\u2019s always been, which is relentless. But in those games, in certain situations the ball could be in Paul\u2019s hands or Carmelo\u2019s hands. And the thing that worries us all is he\u2019s going to have more energy now. He doesn\u2019t have to do it all, so it\u2019s going to be tougher on us all to figure out new ways to try and slow him down.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Lin was hurt midway through the fourth quarter of the Nets\u2019 140-131 loss at Indiana on Wednesday in their opener. He landed hard behind the baseline after a drive to the basket and was in tears as he clutched at his knee. The former Harvard guard was hoping for a stronger second season with the Nets. He was limited to just 36 games in 2016-17, mostly because of a left hamstring injury, while Brooklyn finished with the NBA\u2019s worst record. \u201cJeremy worked tremendously hard during the offseason and in training camp and was excited for the prospects of the team this season,\u201d general manager Sean Marks said Thursday in a statement. \u201cWe feel awful that the injury will cost him the season, however our entire organization will be there to support Jeremy in every way possible throughout his recovery. Jeremy remains an important part of this team and will continue to contribute in a leadership role.\u201d Lin scored 18 points before he was hurt while starting alongside fellow point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, the former No. 2 pick acquired from the Lakers in an offseason trade.

Bartelstein told the Globe that Hayward\u2019s surgery Wednesday night and that there are positives on the horizon for Hayward. Mark Murphy of the Boston Globe has more : Prior to the Celtics\u2019 home opener, Hayward sent a video message from his hospital bed before, telling Boston fans: \u201cIt\u2019s hurting me that I can\u2019t be there.\u201d The crowd at the TD Garden for the Celtics\u2019 game against the Milwaukee Bucks cheered when Marcus Smart directed fans\u2019 attention to the scoreboard, where Hayward appeared wearing a hospital gown and sitting up in bed. The arena hushed to hear the brief message, then erupted in another cheer when it was over. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, everybody? Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who\u2019s had me in their thoughts and prayers,\u201d Hayward said in the 30-second message, which was also sent out by the team on Twitter . \u201cI\u2019m going to be all right,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting me that I can\u2019t be there for the home opener. I want nothing more than to be with my teammates and walk out on that floor tonight. But I\u2019ll be supporting you guys from here, and wishing you the best of luck.\u201d After signing with Boston in the offseason as a free agent, Hayward was injured in the sixth minute of his first game for the Celtics, crumpling to the floor Tuesday in Cleveland with a gruesome ankle injury. Players on both teams reacted in horror on at the site of Hayward\u2019s leg bent unnaturally, but coach Brad Stevens said he did not see the injury live and has avoided watching replays. \u201cHaving known him as long as I\u2019ve known him, it\u2019s tough to see him go through this,\u201d said Stevens, who was also Hayward\u2019s college coach at Butler. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure he knows that we\u2019ve got our arms around him.\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said before Wednesday\u2019s 108-100 loss to the Bucks that Hayward was \u201cdown\u201d after the injury that occurred a little more than five minutes into his Boston debut. \u201cI was [at the hospital] for a minute last night and also again today for an hour or so. He\u2019s down,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s a physical pain to it, but I think it\u2019s also doubled by the emotional pain of, you know, he put a lot of effort into trying to start this, his career, out well in Boston. \u201cBut this is a setback; we\u2019re expecting a full recovery. And we know there are going to be a lot of tough days ahead on that recovery but, at the same time, hopefully he\u2019ll improve day to day. But it\u2019s been tough. It\u2019s been tough for him.\u201d Former NBA player Shavlik Randolph, who spent 1 1\/2 seasons with the Celtics in his career , suffered a similar injury in his career. He told ESPN.com\u2019s Jeff Goodman he would not be surprised if Hayward were able to be healed before the season\u2019s end : Per ESPN.com, Stevens said that the Celtics are now trying to figure out how to best fill Hayward\u2019s vacancy on the roster. \u201cI think that we will probably look at the roster spot,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe are bringing [rookie] Jabari Bird back and using one of his [G-League] two-way days today. I think we will at least be actively looking for that roster spot, just because, obviously, the standpoint of the youth, but also because you lose one of your better shooters and more versatile players. A guy who can put the ball in the basket for you. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that works itself out. We haven\u2019t really gotten into it too much because we have our hands full tonight.\u201d Through it all, though, Hayward\u2019s teammates continue to keep him in their thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been tough,\u201d said rookie forward Jayson Tatum. \u201cWe\u2019re just keeping Gordon in our prayers, hoping everything is all right.\u201d Fans who never got to see Hayward in a Celtics uniform lined up before Wednesday night\u2019s game to sign a banner imploring him to get better and \u201ccome back stronger than ever\u201d from the injury. Other fans held up hand-made signs wishing him well. Celtics forward Daniel Theis wrote \u201cGH20\u201d on his shoe, and a fair number of Hayward\u2019s No. 20 jerseys were visible in the crowd. After playing his first seven years with the Utah Jazz, Hayward signed a four-year, $128 million contract this offseason to rejoin Stevens in Boston \u2013 part of a near-complete roster overhaul for the team that finished first in the Eastern Conference last season. The team also traded fan favorite Isaiah Thomas to Cleveland for fellow All-Star Kyrie Irving and shipped out regular starters Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder. In all, just four players on the roster finished last season with the team. Taking Hayward\u2019s minutes, Smart scored 12 points and had nine rebounds on Tuesday night. Smart moved into the starting lineup on Wednesday night against the Bucks. \u201cHe put a lot of effort into starting his career well in Boston,\u201d Stevens said of Hayward. \u201cThis is a setback, but there\u2019s going to be a full recovery.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":43657,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavs-celtics-game-second-most-watched-opener-tnt","date":"2017-10-19","title":"Cavs-Celtics game second most-watched opener on TNT","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2013 \u2013 Cleveland\u2019s victory over Boston in the first game of the NBA season was TNT\u2019s second most-watched telecast ever on opening night.

(AP) \u2014 Warriors forward Draymond Green underwent an MRI exam on his strained left knee and his status for an upcoming road trip is unclear. Golden State expected to release results of the test Wednesday or early Thursday prior to departing for a game Friday at New Orleans. Green got hurt in the closing seconds of the third quarter of Tuesday\u2019s season-opening 122-121 home loss to Houston when he drove left to the basket, took an off-balanced shot and landed awkwardly. He came up hobbling and grabbing at his knee. Golden State missed his presence down the stretch and Green finished just shy of a triple-double with nine points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious but we\u2019ll see,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said after Wednesday\u2019s practice, in which Green didn\u2019t participate. Omri Casspi\u2019s Warriors debut was cut short after he sprained his left ankle late in the third quarter. He had come into the game questionable with a mild sprain of his right ankle. Casspi did some shooting but didn\u2019t practice. \u201cHe just slipped on the floor,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he\u2019s OK. It was a tough break, he\u2019s sprained both ankles in the last week.\u201d Andre Iguodala, meanwhile, practiced Wednesday after missing the opener with a strained back.

Golden State plays Monday at Dallas before returning home for three games next week. The Warriors are being extra cautious at this stage with Iguodala, who is such a valuable contributor off the bench. Kerr has said his team still must get in better shape \u2013 mentally and physically \u2013 and that led to foul trouble throughout the game. Kevin Durant\u2019s baseline jumper at the end went in just too late and Golden State squandered a big lead on the night it received its championship rings.

Shaun Powell :  Golden State Warriors Oklahoma City Thunder Houston Rockets San Antonio Spurs Minnesota Timberwolves Portland Trail Blazers Denver Nuggets LA Clippers The weird teams are the Clippers and Grizzlies. Both are in transition and appear weaker than the last five years when they were playoff fixtures. They\u2019ll flip a coin for the eighth spot. The real intrigue lies with the Spurs and whether they\u2019re still a top-three team in the West, especially after a flat and inactive off-season while others fortified themselves. John Schuhmann :  Tier 1: Golden State Warriors Tier 2: Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs Seeds 5-8: Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz over LA Clippers, Memphis Grizzlies and New Orleans Pelicans. The Clips, Grizzlies and Pelicans have a chance, but it\u2019s hard, at this point, to believe in LA\u2019s durability (Danilo Gallinari is already hurt), Memphis\u2019 talent beyond Mike Conley and Marc Gasol, and New Orleans\u2019 offense on the perimeter. Sekou Smith :  Golden State Warriors San Antonio Spurs Houston Rockets Oklahoma City Thunder Portland Trail Blazers Minnesota Timberwolves Denver Nuggets LA Clippers The mighty Warriors continue their dominance in a retooled Western Conference with San Antonio, Houston, Oklahoma City, Portland, Minnesota, Denver and the Los Angeles Clippers filling out the playoff field. With apologies to LaVar Ball, I don\u2019t see the Los Angeles Lakers having the tools to make good on that playoff prediction. There is too much ground to make up and not enough playoff-ready players in the fold. I love the energy, enthusiasm and the youth movement that is already in motion. But I need to see them in action before I buy a ticket for that bandwagon. The Nuggets are my Western Conference surprise team. The addition of Paul Millsap changes things dramatically for a team that I thought was on the cusp last season. He and Nikola Jokic could be a major problem for opposing teams on a nightly basis. Add a solid supporting cast and you have the makings of a nightmare squad to deal with for a higher seed in the first round of the playoffs. It pains me, by the way, to look at my list and realize Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins and the New Orleans Pelicans didn\u2019t make the cut."},{"id":43658,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-eastern-conference-playoff-teams-2017-18","date":"2017-10-18","title":"Blogtable: Which Eastern Conference teams will make the playoffs in 2017-18?","content":" * * * These eight teams will make the playoffs in the Eastern Conference.  * * * Steve Aschburner : Boston Celtics Cleveland Cavaliers Washington Wizards Toronto Raptors Milwaukee Bucks Miami Heat Detroit Pistons Charlotte Hornets The Kyrie Irving\/Isaiah Thomas trade should energize both the Celtics and the Cavaliers all season \u2013 assuming Gordon Hayward\u2019s brutal misfortune doesn\u2019t torpedo Boston. The Wizards, Raptors and maybe the Bucks will make the East more interesting and competitive than some folks might have expected. Shaun Powell :  Cleveland Cavaliers Washington Wizards Boston Celtics Toronto Raptors Milwaukee Bucks Philadelphia 76ers Charlotte Hornets Miami Heat This is really a nine-team conference, because the only other team with a legit chance to make the playoffs are the Pistons. All the others (Hawks, Nets, Bulls, Pacers, Knicks, Magic) are rebuilding. This allows the Sixers to overcome inexperience to make the cut. And the playoff fence will be far more suspenseful than the opposite end, where the Cavs remain clearly the class of the East. John Schuhmann :  Tier 1: Cleveland Cavaliers (playoff version) Tier 2: Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers (regular season version), Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Washington Wizards Tier 3: Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat The 8 seed: Philadelphia 76ers over Detroit Pistons The playoff Cavs should be a clear favorite to get back to The Finals, but the regular season Cavs are very different from the playoff Cavs and not a clear favorite to get the 1 seed, even after Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury. So, no order of the top five teams (except one that has Cleveland fourth or fifth) would really surprise me come April. Picking Philadelphia over Detroit is being more hopeful about Joel Embiid\u2019s health than Reggie Jackson\u2019s effectiveness, and the preseason was more discouraging regarding the latter. Sekou Smith :  Cleveland Cavaliers Washington Wizards Toronto Raptors Boston Celtics Milwaukee Bucks Miami Heat Charlotte Hornets Philadelphia 76ers The Eastern Conference is wide open after Cleveland at the top. Washington, Toronto, Boston, Miami, Milwaukee, Charlotte and Philadelphia are the teams that should be playoff bound, with the Sixers needing to fend off the crowd for that eighth and final spot. I am trusting that The Process (one Joel Embiid) will play more than 31 games this season and that Ben Simmons will make a huge difference. But I want to reserve the right to change my order in case there is an injury situation with the Sixers. My dark horse crew this season is Toronto. With all of the attention focused elsewhere this offseason, it seems like Dwane Casey\u2019s bunch has been overlooked. They have the key pieces needed to handle themselves in a reshuffled Eastern Conference. They are in that mix with the Wizards and Celtics battling it out for real estate at the top of the standings right behind Cleveland."},{"id":48807,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-one-thing-you-are-eager-see-2017-18-season","date":"2017-10-18","title":"Blogtable: One thing you're eager to see in 2017-18 season?","content":"* * * Entering the new season, what\u2019s the one thing you\u2019re most eager to see?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m working against my own claim to fame when I say I\u2019m eager to see Minnesota end its 13-year playoff drought. After all, all these years later, I remain the only Timberwolves beat writer (1993-2007) to have covered that franchise\u2019s entire postseason run. I\u2019ve given up hope of convincing owner Glen Taylor to bring me back in a phony-baloney $250K job as a combo good-luck charm\/\u201cteam historian.\u201d So they might as well go ahead and win 50 games under Tom Thibodeau, with Jimmy Butler showing the ropes to Karl Anthony-Towns, Andrew Wiggins and the rest. At least I\u2019ll be positioned to cover Minnesota\u2019s next playoff game. Shaun Powell :  I can\u2019t wait to see how the new pieces with little to no previous experience playing with each other mesh together. Chris Paul and James Harden. Russell Westbrook and Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. LeBron James and Isaiah Thomas. Not all of them will work. Chances are, somebody\u2019s bound to flop, and if so, who will it be? John Schuhmann :  Milwaukee\u2019s development. With its youth, length and versatility, this could be the next great team in the Eastern Conference. Giannis Antetokounmpo (22 years old) is the league\u2019s next top-three player and Thon Maker (20) could has a lot of room to grow as well. Their bench seems thin right now, but the Bucks have the ability to improve both offensively and defensively and approach top 10 rankings on both ends of the floor (and compete for a top 3 seed in the East) this season.  Sekou Smith : As intrigued as I was with the idea of the Celtics going into this season, Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury just minutes into his first regular season game in green and white has clouded my view. Prayers up for Hayward and on a complete recovery. The goings on in Oklahoma City moved to the top of my list the moment Sam Presti pulled off the deal to add Carmelo Anthony to core group led by Russell Westbrook and Paul George. It\u2019s the latest iteration of the \u201csuper team\u201d phenomenon that has spread around the league. Unlike some of my scribe friends around the globe, I don\u2019t see this as some train wreck waiting to happen. I love the idea of these guys teaming up to challenge the order of things in the Western Conference. Kudos to Sam Presti for being aggressive in his approach and this is a chance for Westbrook and Anthony, in particular, to change some minds about who and what they are as players in this league."},{"id":48797,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-shootaround-demarcus-cousins-pelicans-could-set-new-trend","date":"2017-10-18","title":"DeMarcus Cousins thinks New Orleans Pelicans could set 'new trend' in NBA","content":" Pace-and-space and guard-heavy play are, for the most part, what leads to success in the NBA these days.

Hayward, who signed a four-year, $128 million free agent contract this summer, went up for an alley-oop pass and collided with LeBron James midway through the first quarter. He got his leg twisted underneath him as he came back to the floor. Hayward collapsed under the basket and looked in horror as his left foot was pointing outward. He put his hands to his face and dropped back to the floor as a hush fell over the sellout crowd inside Quicken Loans Arena. According to The Vertical\u2019s Chris Mannix, the Celtics are cautiously optimistic about Hayward\u2019s injury : After the injury, Hayward\u2019s new teammates huddled in prayer at their bench as a distressed James covered his mouth and several Cleveland players nearby looked away. Hayward had his leg placed in an air cast, and James came over and consoled him before the 27-year-old was pushed from the floor on a stretcher. Cleveland\u2019s crowd gave Hayward a roaring ovation as he left. \u201cYou hurt for him,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of Hayward, his former star at Butler. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough, tough deal, but I guess that\u2019s part of the risk of injury. I really feel for him.\u201d The team later confirmed that Hawyard\u2019s ankle was broken and that he\u2019d fly back to Boston Tuesday night. It\u2019s a devastating blow for the Celtics, who had hoped to close the gap on the Cavs in the Eastern Conference. Now, they could be without Hayward for an extended period. Hayward spent the past six seasons with the Utah Jazz before signing with Boston. The injury overshadowed Kyrie Irving\u2019s return to Cleveland after the All-Star point guard was traded to Boston this summer. LeBron James said seeing Hayward get hurt reminded him of grisly injuries to Paul George, Shaun Livingston and Louisville\u2019s Kevin Ware. \u201cMy thoughts and prayers go out to Gordon\u2019s family. Hope for a speedy recovery, a healthy recovery,\u201d James said. \u201cThose are the injuries that you never see coming, you never want to happen, no matter who it is, no matter what the stature, no matter how much competitive nature that you have.

Several Boston players stood still, crouched low or leaned in, incredulous at what they were seeing. In that instant, the guys over on the Cleveland bench \u2013 with the nearest and clearest view of Gordon Hayward\u2019s hideously twisted left leg and ankle \u2013 recoiled, turning away in unison as if choreographed. It looked like the sort of Fred Sanford routine NBA players break out on All-Star Saturday, wincing and staggering in playful reaction to some dazzling dunk. Only this wasn\u2019t theatrics, this was horrific. And their reactions were emotional, and real. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a couple injuries like that in my lifetime,\u201d Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James said later , long after Hayward \u2013 the Celtics\u2019 shiny new All-Star free-agent acquisition \u2013 had been taken off the floor on a stretcher. \u201cThose are the injuries that you never see coming and you never want to happen, no matter who it is, no matter what the stature, no matter how much competitive nature that you have.\u201d Barely five minutes into the former Utah small forward\u2019s official debut with Boston, he went up for an alley-oop pass, lost his balance when making contact with James and crashed to the court with his left leg bent grotesquely beneath him. His teammate Jaylen Brown finished the play with a layup, but Hayward stayed down. He was angled toward one corner, the far end from Boston\u2019s bench but close to where the Cavaliers were sitting. Hayward\u2019s face contorted in pain, he grabbed at his leg and then his head. Some Cleveland guys actually felt sick to their stomachs and, as many of the 20,562 in the stands realized what was happening, they felt it too. They\u2019re the injuries that generate as many clicks on YouTube as they do claims that they\u2019re too graphic and unnerving to ever view again. Like Golden State guard Shaun Livingston shredding his left knee in the open court with the Clippers in 2007. Or Kevin Ware, a sophomore at Louisville, contesting a shot against Duke in the NCAA tournament and having his right leg crumple beneath him at all sorts of wrong angles. Who can forget former Pacers All-Star Paul George , whose career was put in peril in the summer of 2014? That was when George, in a scrimmage with Team USA in Las Vegas, landed on the basket stanchion and suffered an open tibia\/fibula fracture to his right leg. James ticked them off one after another, each trauma burned into his and many of the other players\u2019 memories. They are sports\u2019 most miserable and unwatchable moments, plays that remind everyone that basketball is just a game and that careers and health can be irretrievably altered in a few regrettable seconds. The air got sucked out of Quicken Loans Arena for a long time Tuesday night. An uncomfortable murmur rumbled around the stands, while rattled players did what they could to breathe and focus again on the floor. It was the opposite of everything the NBA hoped for when it booked the two Eastern Conference rivals to go at it, on network television, in the first of what will be 1,230 games in the 2017-18 regular season.  Of course, the immediate reaction of some involved was to wonder, \u201cGame? What game?\u201d Once Hayward got carted out with what Boston coach Brad Stevens referred to as a dislocated ankle and tibia fracture, more than a few mates and opponents were ready to unplug with him. \u201cYeah. It just really hits hard,\u201d said Celtics forward Al Horford. \u201cBut then you look at the other guys on the team. You look \u2026 you still have a game to play. And there\u2019s no easy way around it. We have to rally up and just think ahead. That\u2019s what we did as best we could tonight.\u201d Said Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love: \u201cI was mad because I\u2019d gone out with two fouls. Then that happened and I was like, aww, OK\u2026\u201d Horford, Kyrie Irving and the rest of the Celtics huddled up near their bench. Their emotions and thoughts were running wild, and it took a minute to gather themselves. Irving, who got his abrupt offseason trade request honored reluctantly by the Cavs, was the targeted \u201c guest of honor \u201d for this one. He got booed lustily at The Q and that was fine, some harmless fun for the fans he\u2019d jilted. Yet that seemed unimportant, too, in the context of what everyone had just witnessed. \u201cAt the end of the day, there was still a game to be played,\u201d Irving said. \u201cAs [harsh] as that sounds, we understand that. We\u2019re professionals. So we just picked the rest of our guys up. \u2026 We all just had to calm down and come into halftime and just speak with one another and get back dialed in.\u201d By the break, Cleveland was up 54-38. Its lead ballooned to 18 at one point, with the Celtics sputtering along at 34 percent field-goal accuracy. That might have messed with the Cavs\u2019 focus, even as Boston was dialing itself back in. Led by young forwards Brown and Jayson Tatum with eight points each, the visitors shot 13-of-21 and outscored Cleveland 33-18 in the third quarter. Had Boston coach Brad Stevens, in his disappointment, broken out a \u201cwin one for Gordo\u201d speech? Stevens, remember, coached Hayward in his two seasons at Butler before they each headed to the NBA. He has known the player since he was 17. \u201cI don\u2019t have any magic words,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou\u2019re all hurting for him, and I\u2019m not going to try to take the human element out of it. \u2026 We played with some semblance of organization and togetherness [after halftime].\u201d The Celtics scratched all the way back and edged ahead for about five of the game\u2019s final six minutes. Then James spun around Brown for a layup and a one-point lead. The Cavs\u2019 superstar pressured Marcus Smart into losing a pass out of bounds at 1:04. Then he got crowded in a double team, only to find Love on the right side for a 3-pointer that made it 102-98. The gap was three in the final seconds when Brown, then Irving missed shots to tie. And that was that. Cleveland was glad to have won but there wasn\u2019t anyone on either side who hadn\u2019t had a rough day at the office. That was part of this night too, the way uniforms and logos and intense competition melted away as Hayward writhed on the court. The Cavaliers were as distraught as the Celtics over his injury. Derrick Rose, who knows a thing or two about lower-extremity blowouts, crouched in silence. Dwyane Wade bowed down. Several of the Cavs, including James and Love, checked in at Hayward\u2019s stretcher before it was rolled off. \u201cEven though he was from the opposing team,\u201d Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said, \u201cwe\u2019re still a fraternity and we\u2019re still brothers.\u201d The notion of unity driving so much controversy in anthem form before so many sports events lately came so naturally to two teams trying to topple each other, chase down the same goals and occupy the same space at season\u2019s end. In real life, a hurricane or some other disaster can bridge gaps between people who otherwise might not budge. In a basketball game, one player\u2019s scary, significant injury can have livelihoods and opportunities flashing before the others\u2019 eyes. And dropping their guards. \u201cEveryone understands that it\u2019s more than basketball,\u201d an emotional Horford said. \u201cOver the years, guys will get to know every guy in the league. And we never want to see anybody get hurt. It just shows the brotherhood in the league. You saw the guys on the other side, how they came up to Gordon to make sure he was fine. Nobody wants to see anybody get hurt.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The kids are laughing and scampering along, and one player stands out. He is seven feet tall and his right foot, the one that cost him his first two seasons in the NBA after he broke it, is noticeably frisky. The Philadelphia 76ers might gag if they saw this. Or be grateful. Joel Embiid is making the ball do flips as he loops around and through heavy-breathing 10-year olds who can\u2019t keep up, and nearby, a restless NBA attendant is looking at his watch. The NBA sent a group of players to South Africa for a week to conduct camps this summer, and this afternoon is devoted to the orphanage. But when the day is over and the engine revs for the trip back to the downtown hotel, there is a lone and stubborn straggler. The bus must wait. The orphans are still fighting him for the ball and besides, Embiid hasn\u2019t scored a goal yet. Even here, the process takes time. He is waved over by a group of elderly women sitting in folding chairs on the other side of the fence. They yell: \u201cAre you American?\u201d He stops everything and approaches and proudly says no, he is just like them, but from Cameroon. They blow air kisses, bless him for working with needy children, and \u2026 have no idea who he is or more importantly, what he went through to make it to America and, at least for a week, boomerang to Africa. And so, moments later, it is official, then. Embiid is back on the bus and feeling the love from not one, but two places famous for being distant: His homeland of an ocean away, and Philadelphia, notoriously picky with its professional athletes. Blessed with height, a delicate shooter\u2019s touch, a magnetic charisma and the scent of a superstar, Embiid is capable of raising the basketball awareness in Philly. The Sixers are just now emerging from the muck of carefully-crafted seasons in which they purposely stunk to stockpile high Draft picks such as Embiid. Their former general manager and architect of this strategy, former GM Sam Hinkie, famously tried to calm the stirring masses with a plea to \u201ctrust the process\u201d which went viral and attached itself to Embiid, who has stolen the copyright and adopted the slogan for himself. Therefore, Embiid at age 23, is more laboratory rat than gym rat. He\u2019s the symbol of success that resulted from humiliating (and intended) failure, the prize for a franchise that averaged 62 losses the last four seasons and did so while winking and wearing a sly grin. There is a string attached, though. The fine print says Embiid\u2019s body must remain in one piece to justify the love and lofty projections, which is tricky. He has only played in three of the six seasons of his organized-basketball life, no thanks to multiple surgeries on his right foot , an achy back and, lastly, a meniscus tear in his right knee . His three-year NBA \u201ccareer\u201d is only 31 games long, all confined to last season, when he showed enough astonishing gifts (20.2 points per game, 7.8 rebounds per game and 2.5 blocks per game in only 25.4 minutes) to make eyeballs pop. That helped convince the Sixers last week to make a five year, $148 million gamble on his future in the form of a contract extension. For those who question the Sixers\u2019 fiscal sanity in that move, Embiid offers a reassuring \u201ctrust the process\u201d response and, perhaps soon enough, a healthy season in which he elevates himself among the league\u2019s premier centers. \u201cI have lots of confidence in myself that I can fulfill my dreams and make the people of Philadelphia proud,\u201d Embiid said, during a break from the kids and camp. \u201cI\u2019m not cocky, I\u2019m humble, but I think I can be really special, one of the top players in the league.\u201d Fortunately, for now, the only throbbing Embiid feels is support in Philly. He isn\u2019t Allen Iverson-level popular , yet given time, luck and a string of All-Star appearances, it could happen. Embiid\u2019s personality and Twitter feed is infectious and magnetic and he has the \u201cit\u201d factor nailed shut. Besides, although the city is begging for a basketball winner, Philly was never a passionate pro basketball town, even when Julius Erving was cupping the ball and causing Michael Cooper to duck. Maybe a new generation of fans and a rejuvenated team changes this. Maybe Embiid leads that movement. \u201cIt would be something, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s been a process my whole life. I started playing basketball very late, and for me to make it to the league so fast \u2026 I\u2019ve always said my life is a movie.\u201d \u201cThe Process\u201d actually began in 2010 in Yaounde, the second largest city in Cameroon. Embiid lived middle class, grew to 6-foot-9 at age 15 and used his height to play \u2026 volleyball. One of his school\u2019s basketball coaches gave him a video of Hakeem Olajuwon and told him to take it home. The coach didn\u2019t think Embiid would watch it over and over and keep pressing rewind. He stopped playing volleyball. Embiid attended a local basketball camp given by Luc Mbah a Moute (also from Yaounde) who, by this time, was established as a good role player in the NBA. Embiid then went to the NBA\u2019s annual Basketball Without Borders camp, which brings together a collection of promising basketball players from around the continent, and Embiid, with six months of basketball experience, didn\u2019t even make the all-camp team. As he watched a group of African teenagers go through the same type of drills, Embiid thought about that rough introduction. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as good as all the guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to shoot, the mechanics, how to handle the ball. It\u2019s just a testament to all the work I put in. I still have a long way to go. I can be so much better. I know Africans, we all start basketball late. This is where it all started for me. \u201cThis is a special place. I know what they are going through. Some of these kids are not going to be in the same position as me but each one is special. What I want to tell these kids is, as long as you put in the hard work every day, everything is going to be OK.\u201d Mbah a Moute encouraged Embiid to stick with the sport. The following year, Embiid improved enough that Mbah a Moute, whose foundation helps find boarding school scholarships in the U.S. for African teens, suggested Embiid take a leap of faith. And so, with the reluctant blessing of his parents, Embiid packed a bag for a strange world after turning 17. \u201cIt\u2019s just about helping them find the right high school and from there advise them on training and getting better and making important decisions like college,\u201d Mbah a Moute said. \u201cMost kids are nervous and excited. I mean, as a teenager you\u2019re leaving your parents, that doesn\u2019t usually happen at a lot of places. But Joel was looking forward to it, to becoming a better player through a more advanced structure.\u201d The inexperience meant Embiid played very little as an incoming junior at Montverde Academy , a national prep powerhouse, before transferring to The Rock School , also in Florida, to get playing time as a senior. That, and exposure through AAU ball, put Embiid on radar and Mbah a Moute encouraged him to take a scholarship to Kansas. In retrospect, Embiid is amazed by his American passage, which offered no guarantees and if anything could\u2019ve been fraught with speed bumps. While in high school, he lived with other Africans who spoke French, his primary language, none of whom reached the NBA. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t want to let me go,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cMy mom too. It was a difficult decision because I had just started playing. Nobody really knew how good I was going to be. I wound up by myself, didn\u2019t know English. I had to go through a lot, learning the language and the game. I\u2019m glad I did it the right way. \u201cI think it would\u2019ve been a little easier if I grew up in America, they\u2019ve got better conditions for basketball players. At the same time, many people have said to me that having to start playing so late helped me not pick up bad habits.\u201d Embiid didn\u2019t suit up for the NBA Africa Game 2017 , and didn\u2019t play in a controlled scrimmage until just a few days ago. He was still hyper-careful about his meniscus tear from January, and he didn\u2019t want to throw his ongoing contract talks with the Sixers for a loop. His collection of injuries are as attached to him as his Twitter affection for Rhianna. His career is 31 games and the most minutes for one game is 30. It\u2019s a stigma he can\u2019t shake until he plays a full season without a limp. His first two NBA seasons were a complete wash, both professionally and personally. Any type of foot fracture can be a fiendish injury for big men (think Sam Bowie, Bill Walton and Greg Oden). The navicular bone break, luckily, didn\u2019t prove as devastating to Embiid. During this time, he lost his younger brother, Arthur, to a car crash back in Cameroon in 2014 . And he was admittedly frustrated and angry and at times immature during constant rehab. After healing from two foot surgeries came the abrupt ending to his third season because of minor knee surgery, just when things were looking up. Embiid was a serious candidate for Rookie of the Year anyway. \u201cIt sucked,\u201d he said about last season. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to describe it. Not being able to play basketball for two years and being away from everything and going through surgeries, and then getting injured again, that\u2019s not a good way to start your career. If only people knew the tears I shed. \u201cI missed basketball so much that when I get back on the court this season, to me I\u2019m going out there and have fun. I don\u2019t care about anything anyone has to say. One thing I\u2019ve learned, and I use it a lot nowadays, is to just trust the process and keep moving on. I intend to do something very special.\u201d From the despair, a character was born. Embiid developed humor to get him through dark days and put his wit and sharp observations to use on social media. He riffs on pop culture, politics, helicopter fathers (LaVar Ball) and, last weekend, engaged in a Twitter war of words with Hassan Whiteside . \u201cAs for his humor, I didn\u2019t see that coming,\u201d Mbah a Moute said. \u201cHe was actually kind of shy when he came over here. It\u2019s weird. He took it to another level.\u201d The Sixers are a team of intrigue, having added Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz as rewards for tanking, along with veteran shooter JJ Redick, who signed as a free agent. Make no mistake: The bedrock is the freshly-signed and able-bodied Embiid, who forces opponents to adjust because of the unique skills he brings to his position. \u201cWe got a good group of young guys and it\u2019s just about us putting it together,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cWe just got to work together. The main thing is staying healthy. I\u2019m excited about it. Sky is the limit and we have a chance to make playoffs.\u201d He is motivated to become beastly on the floor, mainly to repay Sixers fans who lived through his early ordeal. From his vantage point, Embiid says the city never held his injuries against him, and whenever he and his crutches walked the streets of Philly, he heard encouragement, which surprised him, given Philly\u2019s reputation. \u201cThey showed me a lot of love,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, I know how the response will be when we start winning. I\u2019m excited about the future. I love everything about the city, except cheese steaks. They make me fat.\u201d This is all about fulfilling the expectations of two worlds, then: Philly and Africa, separated by a few thousand miles yet linked by seven feet of finally healthy flesh that\u2019s ready to be unleashed and start a basketball revolution. \u201cIt\u2019s all on me,\u201d said Joel Embiid. \u201cI can become the hub. I will make it happen.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Opening night of the 2017-18 NBA season did not disappoint, pitting the former Cavs playoff hero against the franchise face who was reportedly Irving\u2019s main reason for wanting out: LeBron James. With that as the setting, Tuesday night\u2019s lights focused harshly on the former NBA champion teammates, who are now the unquestioned leaders of arguably the two best teams in the Eastern Conference. Here\u2019s a look at the main highlights: In the hours leading up to Tuesday\u2019s season opener, Irving continued to play coy when reporters directly asked why he wanted out of Cleveland while emphasizing the matchup as just another fraction of the entire season. \u201cIt\u2019s just one game,\u201d Irving said. \u201cWe all understand that, but look at what all this has created. For me, it comes with a lot of added incentive to go out there and really play the game that I love.\u201d Roughly 45 minutes before tipoff, Irving took his first pregame shootaround reps at Quicken Loans Arena as a member of the visiting team. When Irving\u2019s name was announced during starting lineup introduction, Cavs fans mostly booed their former Finals hero. Minutes later, Irving and James made the briefest of contact during pre-tip handshakes and acknowledgements by barely tapping knuckles before the contest was underway.  Throughout the course of the game, Irving and James interacted very little, though both went out of their respective ways to comfort injured Celtic Gordon Hayward . In the second quarter, James attempted a quick seal and post-up of Irving, but the play resulted in a foul before anything of note transpired. James got another attempt in the fourth quarter, blowing by Irving but missing a contested dunk at the rim. Their final encounter wound up being the best, a climactic matchup that could have decided the game. With seconds remaining and Boston trailing by three, Irving wound up with the ball on the right side with James guarding him. The former \u201csidekick\u201d offered a pump fake, then launched the potential game-tying 3-pointer. It fell short, after which the former teammates immediately embraced and did their old handshake routine before parting ways until they meet again."},{"id":43685,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-accept-2017-nba-championship-rings","date":"2017-10-18","title":"Golden State Warriors accept 2017 NBA championship rings","content":"Tuesday night marked the beginning of the 2017-18 NBA season.

Medical personnel immediately attended to Hayward, who was already being prayed for and encouraged by both teammates and Cleveland players, including LeBron James.

McCollum","content":" PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 The season opener for the Portland Trail Blazers has come with an unexpected twist: The absence of starter CJ McCollum, who is suspended for Wednesday\u2019s game at Phoenix. The suspension was handed down Saturday. McCollum was disciplined for leaving the bench when Portland\u2019s Caleb Swanigan and the Suns\u2019 Alex Len tussled in the fourth quarter of a preseason game last Wednesday night \u2014 coincidentally in Phoenix. McCollum didn\u2019t engage anyone after taking a few steps onto the floor, but leaving the bench area merited the penalty under NBA rules. So he will be a spectator when the Blazers open the season against the Suns. He\u2019ll also lose some $164,000 in salary. Some \u2014 including McCollum \u2014 questioned the suspension, given that he isn\u2019t a brawler at all, it was a preseason game, and the action wasn\u2019t menacing. Nonetheless, he took full responsibility for his actions. \u201cYou never want to miss games, especially like that to start the season. You work so hard to prepare for the season, you go through a lot of preseason games that don\u2019t mean anything and then you miss a regular-season game because of an incident that you weren\u2019t even involved in,\u201d he told reporters following practice Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it now but more forward and learn from it.\u201d McCollum averaged a career-best 23 points per game on 48 percent shooting last season as half of a formidable backcourt duo with Damian Lillard, who had a career-best average of 27 points per game, along with 4.8 rebounds and 5.9 assists The Blazers beat the Suns 113-104 in last Wednesday\u2019s game, finishing the preseason 5-1. Phoenix is in rebuilding mode, with coach Earl Watson guiding the development of 20-year-old burgeoning star Devin Booker and promising rookie Josh Jackson, alongside steady point guard Eric Bledsoe. The Suns went 24-58 last season, second-worst in the league. Celebrating the franchise\u2019s 50th season this year, the Suns haven\u2019t made the playoffs in six years, the longest drought in franchise history. The Blazers went 41-41 last season and made the playoffs, where they had the unfortunate luck of facing the eventual champion Golden State Warriors in the first round. Portland got off to a poor start last season but saw improvement with the arrival of center Jusuf Nurkic, who was able to quickly develop chemistry with the rest of the team. He averaged 15.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 20 games with the Blazers, who were 14-5 with him in the starting lineup. Nurkic was injured at the end of last season, and appeared in just one of the playoff games against the Warriors. The 7-footer, known as the Bosnian Beast, shed about 35 pounds in the offseason to become more agile. He suggested that in the talented Western Conference, the Blazers could become the NBA\u2019s Bad Boys, drawing inspiration from the Detroit Pistons of years past. McCollum said it will be tough for the Blazers in a loaded Western Conference topped by the Warriors. But Portland could draw inspiration from two seasons ago, when the young squad of underdogs surprised the league after the departure of four starters. \u201cWe need to be competitive, we need to have a chip on our shoulder, we need to be accountable for our actions, our words and our preparation each day,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has gotten better in the Western Conference, especially in our division.

No surprise. Limited for nearly three weeks by a sprained left ankle that sidelined him in practice and the preseason, James is playing in Cleveland\u2019s opener Tuesday night against former sidekick Kyrie Irving and the Boston Celtics. James, who hurt his ankle on Sept. 27 and played in just one exhibition, arrived at Quicken Loans Arena almost four hours before the opening tip to test his ankle and get treatment. After his workout, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said the 32-year-old told him he would give it a go. \u201cHe feels pretty good, so he\u2019s going to play,\u201d Lue said. The 32-year-old has never missed an NBA opener \u2014 or any first game \u2014 in his career and he wasn\u2019t going to miss this one with Irving back in town for his Boston debut following this summer\u2019s blockbuster trade between the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Lue said James will not have his minutes restricted. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be tired anyway,\u201d Lue joked. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take himself out.\u201d James rolled his ankle during practice last month when he stepped on rookie Cedi Osman\u2019s foot. He sat out Cleveland\u2019s first three exhibitions before playing last week and scoring 17 points with eight turnovers in a loss to Chicago. James aggravated his ankle while making a spin move in that game, which put his status for the opener in question. However, with a chance to face Irving, who has made some veiled comments about his relationship with James, the three-time champion will be on the floor. James\u2019 injury has prevented him from building much on-court chemistry with some of his new teammates. Dwayne Wade, who has been reunited with his close friend in Cleveland, said it may take some time for the Cavs to start clicking. \u201cObviously LeBron is still making his way, feeling himself out, trying to make sure he\u2019s healthy enough,\u201d Wade said. \u201cSo we haven\u2019t had a lot of time together with that unit but it\u2019s not an excuse. We got to be ready to play. Everybody is excited about opening night around the world. We just got to be ready to play. If we make mistakes, we\u2019ll figure it out. But we\u2019re all excited.

So stop focusing on the back end already, and focus on the front. The very first of what eventually will be 1,230 regular season games brings all that stuff. In spades. Turn back the clock just a few months and the Boston Celtics\u2019 visit to Quicken Loans Arena to face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first of two Opening Night games would have seemed pretty standard-issue, season-opening fare. The Eastern Conference champions, at home, against a top contender for that crown. There\u2019d be a few new faces around the edges, most likely, considering how successful both teams\u2019 cores had been. And since there\u2019s no ring ceremony to (depending on your rooting interest) savor or sit through this time around, that\u2019d be about it. Ho-hum. Some folks might even have believed LeBron James and his sore left ankle would skip it for therapeutic reasons. But that\u2019s not this Celts vs. Cavs tipoff game. Not even close. Thanks to Kyrie Irving and his apparent restlessness for the next level of personal stardom, just about every dial on this one has been turned to 11. Competitiveness, familiarity (with each other), unfamiliarity (with themselves), resentment all figure to be at new highs as a result of Irving\u2019s trade request out of Cleveland and the Cavs\u2019 decision to grant it in a blockbuster with their fiercest challengers. > Morning Tip:  Mega-trade between Cavs, Celtics doesn\u2019t change much in East So now, Irving is a Cavaliers\u2019 friend turned foe, facing a return to the franchise he emotionally abandoned and a town he most recently dissed . Following LeBron James\u2019 lead, fans at \u201cThe Q\u201d might be polite during the minute or so a planned video tribute to Irving unspools on the vast videoboards early in the evening, but the rest of the night figures to be as surly toward Irving as it was in that building in 2010 toward James. \u201cHe\u2019s going to cancel out the crowd noise,\u201d former Celtics star turned ESPN analyst Paul Pierce told reporters Monday in a teleconference interview. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably see a lot of boos, but Kyrie is a competitor and I don\u2019t think it will affect him. Not one bit. He has some nervous energy from going back to a team that he played for his whole career, but I think after maybe the first couple minutes, he\u2019ll get over it and be fine.\u201d Whatever reception and contact goes on between James and the alleged prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who snubbed him as no teammate ever has will be part of the entertainment as well. If one or both take the high road, if there\u2019s a hug or a handshake or both, well, let\u2019s be honest: Most of us won\u2019t believe it anyway. Not now, with feelings so raw and so much to be worked out, on the same court and from afar, over the next seven months. There\u2019s more: Irving\u2019s switch into Boston green meant that the Celtics\u2019 MVP from last season, Isaiah Thomas, would be switching in the opposite direction, against his will. And since Thomas and his ailing right hip can\u2019t participate yet, Cleveland will plug in a replacement with his own emotional, winding saga. Former Kia MVP Derrick Rose finally, maybe, this time will manage to overcome injuries, mesh with the talent around him and help a team win. Or not. In all, more than half of the players from these clubs\u2019 2016-17 rosters will be new. Boston returns with only one starter, center Al Horford, intact from the East finals team that lost in five games to the Cavs . Only three other Celtics \u2014 Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier and Jaylen Brown \u2014 accompany him. That\u2019s a massive season-to-season overhaul for a team that already was on the rise. And for all his maneuvering, in spite of so much excitement about Irving, coveted free-agent acquisition Gordon Hayward and promising rookie Jayson Tatum, the only definite thing GM Danny Ainge has to show for it is a cold war with Thomas, the feisty guard whose feelings got bruised in the trade . The Cavaliers are considerably reconfigured as well, with only James starting in the same spot as last season. Kevin Love is Cleveland\u2019s new starting center, bumping his stretch-4 skills up a spot for offensive purposes. That helps to accommodate Rose and James\u2019 old pal Dwyane Wade as the starting and not-exactly-sharpshooting backcourt. Between them, Rose and Wade have a trail of gauze and bandages long enough to wrap a month of Halloween mummies, but the plan is for Cavs coach Tyronn Lue to manage their minutes and deploy his squad\u2019s newfound depth expertly enough to avoid nagging or serious injuries not just for them but for all. Forward Jae Crowder, previously Boston\u2019s fierce defender and deep threat, came over too in the deal to satisfy Irving and he\u2019s only slightly less peeved about it than Thomas. Crowder is now a Cavs starter, which means both Tristan Thompson and J.R. Smith \u2014 after starting for a team that went to three consecutive Finals \u2014 have been moved to the bench. There\u2019s a dynamic there for Cleveland\u2019s chemistry that will play out over time but will get plenty of mentions in Game 1. That might be the best thing about the offseason interactions of these competitors and growing rivals: The seeds sown over the summer will take most of the 2017-18 season to bloom. Boston upgraded and downgraded all at once, losing a fair amount of grit and identity in Thomas, Crowder and two-way guard Avery Bradley (jettisoned to Detroit to make way for Hayward, bringing back injured Marcus Morris in the deal). It remains to be seen how it all meshes, particularly given Irving\u2019s desire to shine. Said Pierce: \u201cWho\u2019s going to be willing to sacrifice? Who\u2019s going to be willing to take less or do more? Those things come up. When you look at Gordon, he was the leading man in Utah. Kyrie, he was the leading man at some point, but then he became the second fiddle to LeBron. Now he\u2019s probably going to be the leading man again. How will Gordon Hayward take to that? How will the rest of the guys, the rookies and the young guys fall into their role?\u201d For Cleveland, this doesn\u2019t figure to be another 82-game slog of survival like last season. The Cavaliers actually need the long run-up to the postseason to gel and coalesce. Thomas is expected back before February, and swapping out starting point guards on the fly is no simple thing even for mediocre teams. More than that, there\u2019s a Miami Rust feel to this group, new faces orbiting a revamped Big Three, except the principals are older and no one has time to burn a Finals the way the ascending Heat did in 2010-11. Oh, and we\u2019ll ignore the elephant in the room of James\u2019 impending free agency just like everyone else is pretending to. So both the Celtics and the Cavaliers need to wring more meaning out of the games they\u2019ll play between tonight and mid-April. Toronto, Washington and maybe even Milwaukee will be pushing hard, too. There\u2019s some desperation in Detroit and Charlotte and an anxious mix of potential and impatience in Philadelphia, all contributing to an Eastern Conference that doesn\u2019t seem quite as sleepy as it might have a few months back. For that, we can give credit to Irving and his antsy, ambitious ways. He\u2019ll be the one Tuesday night with the jersey in flames. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He also had reason to doubt a championship would ever come there. So sometime between walking off the floor after a Game 7 loss with the Clippers last spring and walking back onto it Tuesday night in a Houston Rockets uniform, Paul decided he needed to pack up his family and try for a title elsewhere. \u201cI just felt that it was time,\u201d Paul said. His free agency process and decision is the subject of a three-part documentary series titled \u201cChris Paul\u2019s Chapter 3\u201d that debuts Thursday on ESPN. The first episode shows Paul\u2019s frustration following the Clippers\u2019 ouster against Utah in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs and his questioning the Clippers\u2019 culture. He had helped them become a perennial playoff team since his arrival in 2011, but not one that ever seriously contended for a title, \u201cSomewhere, I don\u2019t know when it was \u2013 I\u2019m not a saint by any means, it could have a lot do to with me also \u2013 but we just weren\u2019t having as much fun,\u201d he said. He talked with his family and business partners about possibilities with Boston and San Antonio \u2013 where he feared Gregg Popovich might only coach for a couple more years \u2013 and visited music mogul Jay-Z and Disney CEO Bob Iger for their advice. He began to view Houston as the best option and eventually accepted a trade in late June, agreeing to opt in for the final year of his contract and delaying free agency until next summer. All that after he had bought a house in Los Angeles across the street from Clippers teammate Paul Pierce, moving his in-laws in last January. \u201cTruthfully, I didn\u2019t think there was no way that Chris would leave the Clippers,\u201d said Pierce, now retired and an ESPN analyst. \u201cHe really built up something special, you know, with getting the Clippers back to being legitimate, make the playoffs every year, (winning) 55 games. He just bought a new home like less than a year ago. He had a $200 million offer on the table. So that really shocked me that he would leave.\u201d Paul never planned for his first real foray into free agency to become public. He wanted the videos shot for his own personal archives, but after reviewing the footage decided that others would be interested. \u201cWhen it all came together and we saw how it looked it was like, man this would be cool to tell the story of how it\u2019s not just cut and dry, you just pick a team,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe showed the move and everything that goes into it.\u201d Paul laments having to always have the ball in his hands in Los Angeles \u2013 which won\u2019t be a problem alongside James Harden in Houston. And he worries about having to move his two young children, eventually telling his son he can\u2019t go do his job without him. And after they finally move, Hurricane Harvey devastates Houston, a focus of the second episode. \u201cWe are constantly looking for opportunities to bring fans closer to athletes in order to better understand their experience. In this series, Chris Paul gives fans a truly unprecedented look at his free agent decision-making process and how he thinks about both his basketball career and his life off the court,\u201d said Connor Schell, ESPN executive vice president of content. All three episodes will be available on the ESPN App and on-demand beginning Friday. They will then air next Tuesday from 8-9:30 p.m. EDT on ESPN. Paul said he learned a lot about the free agency process \u2013 but would love to avoid having to do it again next summer. \u201cIn a perfect world you win a championship and there\u2019s nothing to even talk about,\u201d he said."},{"id":43737,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-shootaround-joel-embiid-minutes-limit-start-season","date":"2017-10-17","title":"Joel Embiid's minutes limit expected to be 'in the teens' early on","content":" Last week, the Philadelphia 76ers made sure budding star center Joel Embiid would be a part of their future for a long time by inking him to a lucrative contract extension .

Rather than retreat and recoil, a handful of NBA contenders regrouped, emphasis on grouped. Yes, almost collectively, these teams decided not to roll over and surrender the next championship to the Warriors. They engaged in a frantic arms race in the offseason, snapping up future Hall of Famers, doubling and even tripling up on superstars, fortifying the roster and in some cases shoving all of their chips to the center of the table. > Aldridge: 24 questions (and answers) for 2017-18 > Warriors Week on NBA TV In particular, eight players in particular with a combined 45 All-Star appearances changed uniforms, all going to places where there\u2019s now a reasonable and understandable murmur about playing beyond May and into June. Here\u2019s the truly weird part about all the activity that took place over the last three months: It probably won\u2019t change anything. You could almost envision that, while the madness swirled around them, the team built for a dynasty eased back in their recliners, watched all the drama unfold and tossed back popcorn. As Draymond Green told GQ magazine: \u201cIt\u2019s so funny sitting here and watching this (bleep).\u201d Perhaps the Warriors are flattered by all the commotion they\u2019ve caused, the money they forced teams to spend, the panic they sent through the league and certainly the sour taste they left in the mouths of a half-dozen or so opposing stars. Yes, there\u2019s a world of hurt feelings. LeBron hasn\u2019t gotten over that spanking in the NBA Finals or the sight of Draymond sashaying around in that \u201cQuickie\u201d t-shirt worn at the victory parade, mocking the length of the series. Russell Westbrook is still snapping at anyone who brings up His Name and sending cryptic trolling via social media to That Guy, the traitorous Kevin Durant. Meanwhile, Chris Paul must have deep red welts from the annual lashings he got from Golden State in the past. After he was traded from Oklahoma City to New York, Enes Kanter wailed \u201cplease beat the Warriors for me\u201d in his good-bye video to his ex-teammates. So here we are, tipoff time on the eagerly anticipated 2017-18 season. The next eight or so months will determine if that massive upgrading was all a waste of time and resources, in terms of the big picture, which will be the case if the championship trophy returns to the team that \u2014 get this \u2014 didn\u2019t make a single significant change in an offseason of many . Because, why should the Warriors react to the reaction? They\u2019re a collection of superb players in their prime, especially the core group, and you\u2019ll need the superzoom lens to locate their weakness. Durant and Draymond, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala and coach Steve Kerr and others are lava rumbling down the NBA mountain. They\u2019re capable of leveling everything on the path, and everyone in Oklahoma City, Houston, Cleveland, San Antonio and Boston is aware of this. ( In the annual NBA.com GM survey , who were asked which team is the favorite in 2017-18, the Warriors won 93 percent of the vote.) All the Warriors did was write fat checks to re-sign Iguodala, Curry and Durant, then pull enough loose change from the sofa for newcomers Nick Young and Omri Casspi, and boom, finished. None of the key players were ever a serious threat of bailing. Iguodala toyed with the idea of taking his two championship rings to Houston or the Minnesota Timberwolves, but this was more of a leverage play on the Warriors. He loves the Bay Area and the business trappings of Silicon Valley. Curry was getting his max money after four years of being the biggest NBA bargain since Michael Jordan signed for eight years and $25 million in 1988. Durant did take less, although he knew that when he signed up two summers ago; anyway, he\u2019ll get his money and, like Iggy, he\u2019s taking advantage of his surroundings and sticking his toe in the lucrative dot.com business. \u201cThree years in a row in the Finals, trying to make it a fourth, very few teams in the league have done that \u2026 the challenge is obvious,\u201d said Kerr. Meanwhile, some of the brightest front-office minds in basketball \u2014 Daryl Morey of the Houston Rockets, Sam Presti of the Oklahoma City Thunder, Danny Ainge in Boston along with newcomer Koby Altman of the Cavs who is the early candidate for Kia Rookie of the Year \u2014 cooked up formulas designed to shock the world just in case one of the key Warriors grabs a body part. Or maybe these general managers genuinely feel they\u2019ve got a shot even if the Warriors are healthy. The common offseason thread they shared? They all pounced on the chance to steal a distressed property and roll the dice. Morey did this with Paul, whose time with the Clippers had run its unfulfilled course as Morey didn\u2019t trade anyone whose skills the Rockets can\u2019t replace. Paul has remained remarkably consistent after 12 seasons and if anything is a better 3-point shooter (41 percent last year) for a team that lives and dies by the shot. As good as the Warriors are from deep, the Rockets are historic, with Paul joining James Harden, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza and reigning Kia Most Improved Player winner Eric Gordon. In half court and in transition, the Rockets are fluid. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop them; it\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said about the Warriors\u2019 offense. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop us either.\u201d Defensively, Houston suffers in comparison to Golden State. Other than wing defenders Trevor Ariza and Paul and Clint Capela at the rim (and perhaps newbies Luc Mbah a Moute and PJ Tucker), nobody impacts the game on that end. Paul and Harden still must prove to be on-court buddies. And most of this falls to Harden, who has overtaken playmaking responsibilities from every point guard since coming to Houston and shows no desire to play off the ball, especially after D\u2019Antoni shoveled it to him last season. How will that dynamic work between Paul and Harden over 82 games and the playoffs? It\u2019s fair to ask. The same is true to a slightly lesser degree in Oklahoma City where Paul George, Carmelo Anthony and Westbrook might give the Warriors a run in a three-on-three contest. Westbrook\u2019s ball dominance isn\u2019t likely to be an issue with George, an unselfish star, but \u2018Melo has never deferred to anyone outside of the Olympic teams. Like George, Melo is playing for money and also respect after his health issues and declining play the last few seasons in New York. In a best-case scenario that\u2019s not all that unrealistic, Westbrook will play nice and try to keep these guys happy so they\u2019ll re-sign next summer and not leaving him holding the bag. \u201cYou (reporters) keep asking about the chemistry every damn day,\u201d sneered Westbrook. \u201cIt\u2019s a season-long thing. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. We\u2019re going to get it together.\u201d OKC\u2019s bigger worry against Golden State is the support help, which is high on defense and absurdly low on intangibles and intimidation. Remember, not only are the Warriors good, they\u2019re deep, much more than OKC. The last time the Celtics underwent a major facelift was a decade ago when Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen linked with Paul Pierce. This facelift, however, will take some time to be fully realized. Challenging the Warriors with a pair of young pups (rookie Jason Tatum, second-year player Jaylen Brown) forced to do heavy lifting in the rotation is unrealistic. Plus, the Celtics might not get out of the East. So the Warriors don\u2019t need to worry about Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving until the new arena is done in San Francisco. Staying on the low-low are the sneaky Spurs. They subbed out bouncy, athletic Jonathon Simmons for aging Rudy Gay coming off Achilles surgery and won\u2019t have a gimpy and rehabbing Tony Parker until midseason. Oh, and they chose not to trade LaMarcus Aldridge \u2014 the mild market for him perhaps had something to do with it \u2014 who did a belly-flop in the 2017 Western Conference finals after Kawhi Leonard got injured. And yet, Draymond recently said the Spurs, more than anyone else, are on his radar. San Antonio folks will be quick to remind you that, before Zaza Pachulia\u2019s dastardly foot trick that caused Leonard to sprain an ankle in Game 1, the Spurs were up 25 points on the champs. It\u2019s true that Golden State was getting rocked and yes, Gregg Popovich\u2019s Spurs are capable of spooking any team in the league. Maybe had the Spurs grabbed an A-list talent in a trade or free agency (something they rarely do), they wouldn\u2019t feel like a team that\u2019s a superstar short. But they do, and they are. This brings everything back to the team and player who stared across the court from Golden State the last three summers. Look out: LeBron\u2019s help in Cleveland has never been better than now. \u201cI can tell by the schemes we\u2019re putting in, it\u2019s all in place for that matchup,\u201d said Jae Crowder, meaning a four-peat in June with the Warriors. Dwyane Wade and Derek Rose are peak-2011 guys looking to steal a few extra golden years (and maybe a title) and if one of them gets going. Getting them both? That\u2019s a bonus. Wade remains on the same wavelength the two shared with James, but just needs his body to cooperate with it. Kevin Love seems prime for a big season, as he finally looks comfortable being on the same floor with LeBron. Remember when Love was benched during the 2016 NBA Finals? Hard to believe now. Plus, he brings much needed 3-point shooting to a team that finished near the bottom last season. The mystery is Isaiah Thomas, obviously. Whenever he returns from his aching hip, he has the tools to give the Cavs every bit of offense that Irving gave. Plus, the pending free agent is in money overdrive; Thomas has never made more than $8 million a year. As for LeBron, no need to weigh the merits: Amazingly durable, highly productive after 14 years, perhaps juiced to win another MVP and certainly to issue paybacks to the Warriors. Yes, as a few teams concluded this summer, the best way to make a run at the Warriors is by making changes and come armed with more talent. Well: Too bad these teams couldn\u2019t pool their best players together and form a super team. Now that would get our attention. The one NBA team with few questions or issues or soft spots is the team that didn\u2019t need to make wholesale changes last off-season. Golden State is simply playing a different game. You see, while everyone is frantically trying to form a lineup good enough to beat the Warriors, the Warriors are busy trying to form a dynasty. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be better this year,\u201d said Kerr.

A person with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the one-year agreement to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because Jefferson\u2019s deal hasn\u2019t been disclosed by the team. ESPN first reported the deal, which it said is worth $2.3 million. The Nuggets open the season Wednesday in Utah. Jefferson was recently waived by Atlanta after being dealt to the Hawks from Cleveland. He became a free agent on Monday, with Denver quickly jumping to the top of the list. The 37-year-old Jefferson spent two seasons with the Cavaliers and played a big role off the bench during the team\u2019s 2016 championship season. He appeared in 79 games last season, averaging 5.7 points in 20.4 minutes. Jefferson also has played for the Nets, San Antonio Spurs, Milwaukee Bucks, Jazz, Golden State Warriors and Dallas Mavericks over his 16-year career. In Denver, he figures to back up Wilson Chandler at small forward and provide leadership on a Nuggets squad that many predict to be in the playoff race after narrowly missing a spot a year ago. The team hasn\u2019t been to the postseason since 2012-13. Heading into the season opener, Denver\u2019s starting lineup looks like this: Paul Millsap at power forward, Chandler, Nikola Jokic in the middle and Gary Harris at shooting guard. The point guard situation remains up in the air. ESPN reported that Denver plans to waive veteran Jameer Nelson. That leaves youngsters Jamal Murray and Emmanuel Mudiay to play the position."},{"id":43730,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-marcus-smart-jabari-parker-unable-reach-extension-agreements","date":"2017-10-16","title":"Reports: Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker unable to land contract extensions","content":"The 2018 NBA free agency pool will reportedly become even deeper.

The kinks the two sides have been trying to work through had league observers believing Aldridge might not be long for San Antonio. Just as they have for more than 20 years, the Spurs care little about what others think. The Spurs announced Monday night that they had signed Aldridge to a contract extension, but did not reveal terms of the deal. According to a person with knowledge of the agreement, the deal involves Aldridge exercising the 2018-19 player option on the original four-year max deal he signed with the Spurs in 2015. He then will get another two years and $50 million tacked on to the deal. ESPN first reported the agreement. When the Spurs beat out the Suns, Lakers and several other suitors for Aldridge two summers ago, it was a departure from the franchise\u2019s long history of drafting and developing its stars. With Tim Duncan nearing retirement and Kawhi Leonard emerging as the team\u2019s next focal point, the Spurs splurged for Aldridge in free agency to try to extend the team\u2019s window for competing in the Western Conference. He came from Portland, where he had spent years as the No. 1 option for the Trail Blazers, a formidable low-post presence with a strong mid-range game. Aldridge was an All-Star in his first season in San Antonio, but his individual numbers declined significantly. That was to be expected in San Antonio\u2019s system, which emphasizes ball movement and tries to limit minutes to keep veterans fresh for the postseason. Last year, Aldridge averaged 17.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, both career lows. But the Spurs won 61 games and advanced to the Western Conference finals, where they were swept by the Golden State Warriors after Leonard injured his ankle in Game 1. The 32-year-old Aldridge and Popovich met this fall to try to find ways to make him feel more comfortable and effective. The dialogue helped strengthen their relationship, made Aldridge feel open to staying in San Antonio and gave the Spurs the peace of mind that they could continue to feature him as a much-needed supporting star for Leonard. The Warriors return almost their entire team and a deeper bench in pursuit of their third championship in four seasons. Oklahoma City added Paul George and Carmelo Anthony as wing men for Russell Westbrook, the Houston Rockets brought in Chris Paul, and the Minnesota Timberwolves added Jimmy Butler all in an effort to make things more difficult for Golden State. With Leonard missing the entire preseason and also scheduled to miss the season opener on Wednesday against Minnesota ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) because of a quadriceps injury, Aldridge\u2019s offensive presence is more important than ever."},{"id":48834,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-nike-commercial-season-15","date":"2017-10-16","title":"'Do they know what happens now?' asks Nike in new LeBron James commercial","content":" > Opening Night on TNT: Celtics vs. Cavaliers (8 ET, Tuesday) ; Rockets vs. Warriors (10:30 ET ) It was an eventful summer for LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers after falling to the Golden State Warriors in the 2017 NBA Finals.

You\u2019ve been waiting patiently all summer with your questions. Fire away. The Golden State Warriors are still the prohibitive favorites to repeat this season, next season and into the foreseeable future. But it was good to see a good chunk of the Western Conference \u2014 the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder and Denver Nuggets, to name three teams \u2014 not fold before the first card is dealt. That fact alone is incredibly important. The Warriors are still the best team in the West, without question. But if teams don\u2019t even try to get better, or spend money to compete, the whole rationale for playing fades away. The Thunder could have rode Russell Westbrook alone to another first-round playoff loss, watched him walk out the door in free agency next summer and thrown up its hands, plead \u2018woe is us and all small-market teams,\u2019 and enjoyed a luxury tax-free life for the next few years. The Rockets could have just kept selling tickets to fans to watch James Harden and his pals shoot 50 threes a game for the next two or three years. It\u2019s an appealing brand of basketball. Denver could have just kept building through the Draft, climbing a few more wins here or there for a while, and snuck into the eighth seed, choosing to be comfortable rather than bold. But they didn\u2019t. They\u2019ve called and raised. In all likelihood, it won\u2019t be enough to beat Golden State. But those teams can sleep well at night. They\u2019re not cheating their players, or fans. The short answer: no. But it\u2019s closer. Carmelo Anthony will be as good a third option as anyone in the league has, though; he will eat regularly on the weak side as defenses scramble to handle Westbrook-Paul George pick and rolls; a quick seal and \u2018Melo will be off to the races. If coach Billy Donovan goes small ball with Patrick Patterson at the five, there will be many nights when OKC drops a 130 spot. Yes, the Thunder\u2019s defense is going to be an issue; while Enes Kanter was a sieve off the bench, he was coming off the bench, playing behind Steven Adams. Anthony will be starting and playing big minutes, many at the four. But it won\u2019t matter most nights when the Thunder is up 20 to start the fourth quarter, after 36 minutes of Westbrook sorties, George 3-pointers and transition dunks, and Carmelo post-ups and spot-ups (he shot 44.8 percent last season on catch and shoot shots. Among forwards who played 30 or more minutes last season, per NBA.com\/Stats, only Kevin Durant, Otto Porter and Kawhi Leonard shot better ). The Thunder can guard you with George, Andre Roberson and Adams and they can outscore you with Westbrook and George and \u2018Melo. They have a solid bench (Patterson, Ray Felton, Jerami Grant, Alex Abrines) and Westbrook won\u2019t be physically spent by the end of the 2018 playoffs. Wait; what am I saying? Of course he\u2019ll be spent. But he\u2019ll also be playing way deeper into May. The Rockets \u2014 okay, Chris Paul \u2014 wanted this done bad. It won\u2019t hurt Houston in the regular season, when Paul and James Harden will dominate. And while Harden didn\u2019t like Kevin McHale\u2019s critique of his leadership , Mac was spot on. That doesn\u2019t make \u201cThe Beard\u201d a bad guy or teammate \u2014 people gravitate to their comfortable roles in life, and CP3 is a natural-born leader. Harden will, one thinks, be more comfortable with slightly less light on him. They\u2019ll do fine playing together and off one another. But the shadow of the Rockets\u2019 implosion from deep \u2014 29 of 88 on 3-pointers the last two games against the Spurs in their Western Conference semifinals series \u2014 still hangs over them. Ryan Anderson was negated in the postseason. There\u2019s a reason CP3 pushed for \u2018Melo so hard. The Rockets will need unexpected consistent offense from a P.J. Tucker or Luc Mbah a Moute in May if they have any hopes of playing in June. Maybe Toronto, with C.J. Miles shooting 40 percent on 3-pointers to complement Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, will break up what seems inevitable. Maybe Washington, with its super-solid starting five intact, now has the mental toughness to bust past the second round, where it\u2019s been beached three of the last four postseasons. But it doesn\u2019t feel like that. Boston, ultimately, should be a lot better this season than last. It will take a while for coach Brad Stevens to figure out the rotation and whether Jaylen Brown can really stick at the two, but ultimately, the Celtics have two dynamic playmakers\/scorers in Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, and with Al Horford providing the glue at both ends, they\u2019re going to be a load by the end of the season. And while Cleveland will have to wait a while for Isaiah Thomas, the Cavs have more than enough firepower until Thomas can make his debut. Whatever Dwyane Wade has left will be accentuated playing with James, and Kevin Love ( holy moly, is he underrated ) will feast drawing slower, bigger centers out to him on the perimeter. J.R. Smith doesn\u2019t like losing his starting job to Wade , and he should be ticked. But he nonetheless will help Cleveland\u2019s bench, which will be incredibly difficult in its own right with Tristan Thompson and Kyle Korver complementing Smith. And that\u2019s before Thomas returns, which will put Derrick Rose on that second unit. There won\u2019t be any rest for defenses who\u2019ll then have to contend with a rested James, et al, coming back. It says here that not only will the Cavs not miss Irving offensively, they could be even more diverse and difficult to guard this season. Not to mention that James is supremely motivated to make an eighth straight Finals. At first glance, with Durant and Klay and Draymond (and, now, Nick Young) all needing to get fed as well, it would seem impossible for Curry to best the mark he set two years ago, on the 73-9 regular season team . But consider: coach Steve Kerr thinks a new guy always blossoms in his second year with the Warriors, which means Durant should be even more lethal offensively this year, as the Warriors\u2019 offense reaches an even higher level of efficiency. And the way they move the ball, it\u2019s not a stretch to think that with defenses tripping over themselves to get to Durant, Curry could get into one of those ridiculous grooves that could leave him within striking distance of 402 by the end of the season. The New York Knicks were hardly a power in the East before trading Anthony, but his departure creates one more team that will struggle to win 35 games this season. With the paucity of talent there should be at least four 50-win teams in the East \u2014 Cleveland, Boston, Toronto and Washington \u2014 with the Milwaukee Bucks knocking on the door. The Bucks were fine off the court \u2014 t heir new arena is already more than halfway constructed and looks like it\u2019s going to be a gem \u2014 although the surrounding mall that is supposed to be part of the complex is not going up as quickly . But the Bucks didn\u2019t address their bigs-heavy roster and move some of the surplus \u2014 how can coach Jason Kidd keep all of Greg Monroe, Jabari Parker and John Henson happy with Thon Maker scarfing up more and more frontcourt minutes? \u2014 for the shooting Milwaukee still needs. The East is so open, and Milwaukee is so close to breaking through into elite status with Giannis Antetokounmpo an elite performer. Gay says he\u2019s cool starting or coming off the bench for the Spurs, but he\u2019d best as San Antonio\u2019s sixth man, at least to start things. Bringing Pau Gasol off the bench didn\u2019t work so well, so if he\u2019s starting at center, coach Gregg Popovich can\u2019t go small ball with \u201cCousin\u201d LaMarcus Aldridge at the five and Gay at the four alongside Kawhi Leonard. (Current state of Spurs fans\u2019 cuticles here and here as they consider a season with an extended Klaw absence if this quad injury doesn\u2019t improve soon .) The Spurs could have some serious firepower in reserve if Gay and Patty Mills come off the bench, but Mills or Dejounte Murray will likely have to start at the point until Tony Parker comes back. Should he and Steve Kerr and Stan Van Gundy stick to sports? http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v No. I say Markelle Fultz. What, you thought I was gonna pick against a DeMatha Catholic man? (Actual unretouched photo of me as a sophomore at the most successful high school in the history of the United States may or may not be here ). Playing off of Joel Embiid, J.J. Redick, Robert Covington \u2026 it\u2019s hard to see Fultz not looking really good when he should have all kinds of room to operate. Lonzo Ball will put up bigger numbers, and Tatum will be on a better team. But Boston was good last year, and Jayson Tatum will likely not play as much as the others. The Sixers are poised for a big jump up in the standings, and that\u2019s always a narrative that voters like and get behind \u2014 which is what will hurt Dennis Smith Jr.\u2019s chances in Dallas. Now that the inevitable buyout of Wade\u2019s $24 million deal by the Bulls has led to the equally inevitable trek to Cleveland to play with James, can the 35-year-old Wade still be a significant contributor on a title contender? Given the general dysfunction in Chicago last season, you can dismiss most of the good and bad numbers Wade put up, with two exceptions: he still averaged almost five free throw attempts per game , and he shot 31 percent on 3-pointers \u2014 not great, but more than double his anemic 15.9 percent behind the arc in 2015-16 , his last with the Miami Heat. Wade obviously knows the cheat code for how to most effectively play off of James, so he\u2019ll use the regular season to learn his teammates and be ready for the playoffs. But can Wade hold up over seven games defensively if he has to chase, say, Bradley Beal around, or try to deny DeRozan his preferred mid-range spots, and still be productive offensively? My guess is they\u2019ll pretty good in the 60 or so games I anticipate Embiid will play this season \u2014 I\u2019m assuming several designated off days for him during the season, not another injury. The mix of young talent (Fultz, Embiid, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Covington) and crafty vets (Redick, Amir Johnson) should mesh to make the 76ers a very tough team to defend. But Philly has to resolve the Jahlil Okafor situation, and in fairness to him, give him a fresh start somewhere else with a trade as soon as possible. If I were a good team that would be hard-pressed to add a free agent any time soon and feels a player short of true contention \u2014 I\u2019m looking at you, Memphis Grizzlies and Wizards \u2014 I\u2019d work hard to get the new, slimmed-down Okafor on my squad while he\u2019s still on his rookie contract and make him the focal point of a kick-ass second unit. I\u2019m picking up what you\u2019re putting down. A full season of the \u201cBosnian Beast\u201d in the middle, it says here, will vault Portland into the top four in the West. Note I said \u201cfull season.\u201d That means Jusuf Nurkic has to give coach Terry Stotts between 65-70 starts for the above premonition to be, as they say in the legal world, actionable. If so, Nurkic\u2019s underrated scoring and passing out of the post will only make Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum that much more deadly out front, along with improving Portland\u2019s defense. Per Basketball-Reference.com, the Blazers were 11.6 points per game better than the opposition with those three on the floor together and a +5 when their regular five-man lineup with Maurice Harkless and Al-Farouq Aminu joined the guards and Nurkic. And that\u2019s pronounced, \u201cNoor-kitch,\u201d accent on Noor. Kevin Costner\u2019s accent in \u201cRobin Hood\u201d \u2014 worst ever, right? Yes, but Natalie Wood\u2019s in \u201cWest Side Story\u201d was painful, too. The Clippers are my darkhorse this season \u2014 if they do the right thing and go small more often. They\u2019re doing it more in practice so far than in games because Danilo Gallinari is working through a foot injury, but Blake Griffin at the five and Gallinari at the four could be spicy during the regular season. That would mean Sam Dekker and\/or Wes Johnson would have to become credible and dependable at the three, allowing coach Doc Rivers to play a Pat Beverly-Milos Teodosic backcourt more often, which will just be fun. This would, of course, mean less DeAndre Jordan, and \u2026 that may not be the worst thing. Nothing against DJ, who is the best defensive big in the league, bar none. Unfortunately, the NBA isn\u2019t about defense any more \u2014 at least not in the traditional sense. Even someone like Jordan who doesn\u2019t just block shots, but also helps snuff out opposing pick and rolls, becomes less valued by the league\u2019s advanced stats crowd if he doesn\u2019t contribute more offensively. The three has gone a long way to tyrannizing the defense-dominant big man out of the game. (Zach Lowe recommends the Wizards try to get Jordan via trade, and it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that name mentioned in connection with Washington, the idea being the only chance the Wizards have of beating Cleveland or Boston is to slow them down enough defensively that Wall-Beal-Porter can try and keep up offensively. Washington is definitely a load when Wall gets locked in on D and creates turnovers, and the idea of Jordan inhaling lobs from Wall is enticing to think about. But the Wizards are not \u2014 not \u2014 going to take on a fourth big contract, and Jordan\u2019s surely going to opt out after this season; he\u2019s rightly expecting a massive payday in 2018, and the Clippers certainly now have motive and means to retain him.) Anyway, some Lou Williams, Austin Rivers and\/or Teodosic and Willie Reed off the bench isn\u2019t bad, either. Don\u2019t @me, LaVar. Kuzma has followed up a very strong Vegas Summer League with high notes in preseason, averaging better than 19 points per game for the Lakers. He\u2019s been dazzling at times , displaying in-between skills that intrigue, and showing why so many teams were trying to trade back into the first round to get the Utah forward before L.A. snagged him with its second and much less heralded first-round pick last June . And there will be minutes available at the four this season. So far, Kuzma has displayed unusual strength for a rookie and confidence in his ability to score. Of course, he\u2019s inexperienced, and like all rookies, has to differentiate between an open shot and a good shot. The other, more famous first-rounder, Lonzo Ball, will almost certainly be the better all-around player in time. For this year, though \u2026 hmmm. Honestly, not much. But they\u2019ll always be well-coached and get better. I\u2019d pick one of the young players, like rookie John Collins or second-year small forward Taurean Prince, and concentrate on them during the season. See what they do with their minutes on the floor, and watch how they gradually expand their games at both ends. Seeing a young guy get better as he gains experience and accepts coaching is one of the great joys of watching the NBA every night. The team\u2019s new braintrust of Jeff Weltman and John Hammond will need some time to fix the roster \u2014 a m\u00e9lange of athletic wings that have trouble defending and guards that have trouble shooting. The former is addressed somewhat with the signing of Jonathon Simmons from San Antonio, but I don\u2019t see a solution to the latter with any of the existing backcourt contributors. Unless coach Frank Vogel figures out some way to get more turnovers\/runouts from his group, they just can\u2019t get in transition enough for their length and legs to make a difference. The short answer is, I have no idea. All of NBA Earth has DeMarcus Cousins out of there one way or another (he\u2019s an unrestricted free agent in \u201918 and wants to be on a contender\/the Pelicans will never pay him what he wants and will have to trade him by the deadline\/no way he and Anthony Davis fit together\/Wall agitates for a reunion with his former Kentucky big man in D.C.\/your departure theory here) by this time next year, but we\u2019ll see what coach Alvin Gentry has come up with for \u201cBoogie\u201d and \u201cthe Brow\u201d after a summer to think it over. Rajon Rondo being out hurts their depth , but I have to be honest \u2014 I don\u2019t see how he and Jrue Holiday can possibly work together in a backcourt, and Holiday\u2019s the guy the Pelicans just gave $125 million to, so he should probably have the ball in his hands every night, shouldn\u2019t he? I like Ian Clark and Frank Jackson down there, but that untethered three spot burns a hole in the New Orleans sun. Well, at any rate, should be more fun than watching reruns of My Life on the D-List . Beaker . Everything points to yes, and a relocation to Los Angeles to play with the Lakers or Clippers next year \u2013 except \u2026 what if the Cavs win it all again this year? That\u2019s not an impossible scenario \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s a pretty simple one to lay out: Cavs run roughshod through the Eastern Conference in the playoffs again, get through a good but hardly great Boston team in the conference Finals and set up a fourth straight encounter with Golden State. It\u2019s easy now to say the Warriors dominated the Cavs in last season\u2019s Finals \u2014 but only if you ignore the fact that Cleveland led by six with just more than three minutes remaining in Game 3, only to see the Warriors score the game\u2019s last 11 points to take a 3-0 lead instead of 2-1. And given that Cleveland vaporized the Warriors in Game 4, a 2-2 series would have meant the Cavs just needed to win once in Oracle \u2014 which they\u2019d done twice in the 2016 Finals \u2014 to have a real shot at repeating. The point is, the difference between the teams isn\u2019t as big as Draymond Green would have you believe; the Cavs have no fear of the Warriors, and Jae Crowder gives coach Tyronn Lue a viable on-ball defender for Kevin Durant, leaving LeBron free to play off of Green. And: that unprotected Nets pick , whether one or three or five or seven, is Cleveland\u2019s best recruiting tool. LeBron knows everyone in college basketball and he can literally pick whoever he\u2019d like to finish his career with in Cleveland before handing over the reins. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s definitely staying, either \u2014 only that his departure isn\u2019t the lead pipe cinch some would have you believe. The season to come will have a lot to do with his next decision. Eastern Conference (seeds No. 1-8): Cleveland, Boston, Washington, Toronto, Milwaukee, Miami, Detroit, Philadelphia Western Conference (seeds No. 1-8): Golden State, Houston, Oklahoma City, Portland, San Antonio, Memphis, Utah, Minnesota Eastern Conference semifinalists: Cleveland, Boston, Washington, Milwaukee Western Conference semifinalists: Golden State, Houston, OKC, San Antonio Eastern Conference finals: Cleveland over Boston Western Conference finals: Golden State over OKC (you heard me) NBA Finals: Golden State over Cleveland (in seven games) Giannis Antetokounmpo. NBA MVP, 2017-18. No, ma\u2019am. As always, we start the season with 24 questions (or predictions, or issues, whatever) in honor of Danny Biasone , the late owner of the Syracuse Nationals, whose discovery in 1954 helped save the league. At that time, the NBA was in the midst of a literal slowdown, in large part by teams that were desperate to figure out some kind of way to stay competitive with George Mikan, the league\u2019s first superstar big man, and his team, the Minneapolis Lakers. Teams would hold the ball for minutes at a time without shooting in an effort to shorten the game and give them a chance to beat Minneapolis late. But the end result was boring \u2014 very boring \u2014 basketball. At the owners\u2019 meetings that year, Biasone came up with an idea. NBA games were 48 minutes long. Biasone figured out that in a normal game, one not waylaid by the slowdown tactics, about 120 shots \u2014 60 per team \u2014 were taken. So, why not just divide the number of minutes in every game \u2014 2,880 \u2014 by the number of shots in an average game \u2014 120 \u2014 to come up with some kind of a time limit in which a team had to shoot. And thus, the 24-second shot clock (2,800\/120) was born. With the implementation of the shot clock in the 1954-55 season, scoring went way up, as did the quality of play. Teams were now running up and down the floor in order to try and beat the shot clock, complementing the \u201cfast break\u201d game that many colleges had played for years. But the new style in the pros was immensely popular with fans. And it still is. Plus, there\u2019s just something iconic about that clock counting down every 24 seconds. It\u2019s unique to the NBA. Thus, we ask 24 questions, in honor of the guy who owned a bowling alley as well as the Nationals for much of his adult life , and probably enjoyed the bowling more. * * * MORE MORNING TIP: DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | All-time best NBA GMs | DA\u2019s Mailbag: Kobe over LeBron? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Ismael Morillo: I saw that Jordan interview with Cigar Aficionado . Wouldn\u2019t go quite as far as Jordan, as that would mean that some combination of Cleveland, Boston, Houston, Oklahoma City, Toronto, San Antonio and Washington, depending on who you think is ranked third and further down, is garbage. And I don\u2019t believe that. Clearly Golden State and Cleveland are the top two teams, but there are other very good teams that will be in the mix. Pick and Roll Models. From Zane Aitken: Because Kobe was an assassin. He was a killer. He was a guy that didn\u2019t just want to beat you; he wanted to embarass you and make you never want to go up against him again. And a lot of young men tend to be drawn to larger-than-life personalities like that: athletes as conquerers, dominators. LeBron has never given off that vibe. He wants to win, sure, but he doesn\u2019t want to humiliate anyone out there. And: LeBron always wanted, and wants, to incorporate his teammates in everything he did\/does, on and off the floor. He always \u2014 always \u2014 wants to pass the ball. Conversely, I think it\u2019s fair to say that while Kobe understood that he needed teammates to win games, he wasn\u2019t exactly excited about the idea. Two very different personalities. Well, I can\u2019t dismiss this out of hand, anyway. From Ahmed Tahir: It\u2019s not a bad notion, Ahmed. But I don\u2019t know that having that option would necessarily lead to better All-Star play. Baseball tried a version of this by giving home field advantage, regardless of regular season record, to the team whose league won the Midsummer Classic. It just seemed to annoy people, especially when a team won home field advantage in the All-Star Game, but didn\u2019t have as good a record as the other team whose league lost. And I have never been able to figure out if it\u2019s to one\u2019s advantage or not to have three straight home games during the Finals. So few teams were able to win all three under the 2-3-2 format. Send your questions, comments and the newest recipes for Ursanator Pie  to  daldridgetnt@gmail.com .

As of Miami\u2019s opener on Wednesday against Orlando, Haslem will tie Dolph Schayes and Hal Greer, both of whom played 15 seasons for the Syracuse\/Philadelphia franchise, for ninth place in seasons played with one franchise. He trails Kobe Bryant (20 seasons with the Lakers) and Dirk Nowitzki (starting his 20th with the Mavericks), John Stockton and Tim Duncan (19 seasons each with the Jazz and Spurs), Reggie Miller (18 seasons with the Pacers), Tony Parker (starting his 17th season with the Spurs), John Havlicek (16 seasons with the Celtics) and Manu Ginobili (starting his 16th with San Antonio). Haslem is fourth among active players in seasons played, trailing Nowitzki, Parker and Ginobili. In terms of games played with one team, Haslem currently trails Stockton (1,504), Nowitzki (1,394 and counting), Duncan (1,392), Miller (1,389), Bryant (1,346), Havlicek (1,270), Parker (1,143 and counting), Greer (1,122), Joe Dumars (1,018 games with the Pistons), Calvin Murphy (1,002 games with the Rockets), Schayes (996), Ginobili (992 and counting), Alvan Adams (988 games with the Suns), David Robinson (987 games with the Spurs), Wes Unseld (984 games with the Bullets), Isiah Thomas (979 games with the Pistons), Kevin McHale (971 games with the Celtics), Bill Russell and Fred Brown (963 games with the Celtics and Sonics, respectively), Jerry West (932 games with the Lakers), James Worthy (926 games with the Lakers), Tom \u201cSatch\u201d Sanders (916 games with the Celtics), Magic Johnson (906 games with the Lakers), Larry Bird (897 games with the Celtics), Nick Collison (895 games with the Thunder and counting), Mark Eaton (875 games with the Jazz), Michael Cooper (873 games with the Lakers), Sam Jones (871 games with the Celtics), Rik Smits (867 games with the Pacers), Elgin Baylor (846 games with the Lakers) and Julius Erving (836 NBA games with the 76ers). 3 \u2014 Original WNBA franchises, of eight, that remain in their original cities: the New York Liberty, L.A. Sparks and Phoenix Mercury. The San Antonio Stars, the only other original franchise still in existence, announced last week that they are to be sold and relocated , with multiple reports indicating the new buyer plans to move the team to Las Vegas. The Stars moved to San Antonio from Utah in 2003. 72 \u2014 Age of Gary Gregor, the first-ever Draft pick of the Phoenix Suns, who begin their 50th season of play this season. Gregor played one season for the Suns , averaging 11.1 points per game, before being traded to the Hawks in 1969 for power forward Paul Silas. Gregor played four-plus NBA seasons for Phoenix, Atlanta, Portland and Milwaukee before finishing his pro career in the ABA in 1974 with the New York Nets. 1) Opening Week. This is gonna be fun. (And thank you, shortened preseason!) 2) Good on Damian Wilkins, at 37, not having played in the NBA since 2013 with Philly, making the Pacers\u2019 roster this season. Wilkins, the nephew of Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins and the son of longtime NBA guard Gerald Wilkins, played in the G League last season and got a shot at a roster spot in Indy, unfortunately, when Glenn Robinson III suffered a badly sprained ankle during camp. (Was also pulling for 35-year-old Emeka Okafor, who hadn\u2019t played in the NBA since 2014, to make the Sixers\u2019 roster, but he was among the final cuts Saturday; he\u2019s going to play for Philly\u2019s G League team in Delaware in hopes of getting an NBA gig soon.) 3) You deserve it, Grindfather . 4) A lot of folks wondered if Patrick Ewing would be up for the modern recruiting game when he took the Georgetown head coaching job earlier this year. He seems to be doing just fine so far, with a couple of very solid prospects. 1) I get that Portland\u2019s C.J. McCollum technically violated the NBA\u2019s rules about bench players staying put during an altercation , lest they take part in escalating the fight. He stepped about eight feet onto the court in the Blazers\u2019 exhibition with Phoenix last week. And for that, the NBA suspended him for the first game of the regular season in which he\u2019s physically able to play \u2014 presumably, Portland\u2019s opener Wednesday. But there\u2019s the letter of the law and the spirit of it, and it seems silly to penalize McCollum for an actual game for a technical but hardly dangerous violation that took place in a preseason game. 2) I know next to nothing about soccer, but I know not making the World Cup is a major setback for the U.S. men\u2019s program. 3) It is more than fair to note and criticize the very slow reaction of what is, to also be fair, the very liberal part of Hollywood to the allegations of rape and other sexual assaults by mega-mogul Harvey Weinstein that were first detailed in a New York Times story earlier this month. Assault is assault, whether committed by a potential president of the United States or a generous contributor to the Democratic Party. Condemnation should be swift and unforgiving no matter who the (alleged) perpetrator is or who his friends are. 4) This country is making my right temple throb in frustration . Making people uncomfortable was THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BOOK. \u2014 Hassan Whiteside ( @youngwhiteside ), Friday, 11:15 p.m., throwing vicious shade at Philly\u2019s Joel Embiid after Embiid criticized Whiteside\u2019s play in the Sixers\u2019 last exhibition game Friday against Miami. Whiteside\u2019s bromide led to a series of Embiid responses , which made my heart soar. NBA players who aren\u2019t longtime pals, who haven\u2019t played on each other\u2019s AAU teams since they were 10, who might actually have some enmity toward one another! I love this.

It\u2019s not a trade you make in real life.\u201d \u2014 Isaiah Thomas , in a Sports Illustrated piece by Lee Jenkins , on the deal that sent him from Boston to Cleveland for Kyrie Irving. Thomas said he may \u201cnever\u201d speak to Celtics GM Danny Ainge again after the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be back on the East Coast. It\u2019s fast-paced.

If somebody as special as a Beyonce or somebody like that wanted to come in for a tiny percentage because they wanted to be an ambassador for the team because this is their hometown \u2014 would I sit down and discuss it with them? Yeah, I would sit down and discuss it with them. It\u2019s a compliment to have somebody like Beyonce to want to be a part of your team.\u201d \u2014 New Rockets owner Tillman Fertitta , on the Bloomberg Business of Sports podcast , on potentially allowing the superstar performer and Houston native to purchase a piece of the team after he bought it from Leslie Alexander for $2.2 billion in September. * * * MORE MORNING TIP: 24 questions for 2017-18 | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | All-time best NBA GMs * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

We already had them in Oakland and Cleveland. But now we have James Harden and Chris Paul joining forces in Houston; Gordon Hayward, Al Horford and Kyrie Irving teaming up in Boston; Carmelo Anthony, Paul George and Russell Westbrook getting together in Oklahoma City; Jimmy Butler joining a couple of No. 1 picks in Minnesota; and Paul Millsap forming a talented frontline with Nikola Jokic in Denver. We also can\u2019t forget DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis, who played just 17 games together last season, getting their first extended run in New Orleans. And eventually, we\u2019ll get Isaiah Thomas joining LeBron James and Kevin Love in Cleveland. So, are all of these super teams going to be super? Probably not. Some of these pairs and trios will make each other better. Some won\u2019t. It happens. It doesn\u2019t mean that the team will be terrible, just that it won\u2019t be as good when all the stars are on the floor than it is when one of them is on the bench, replaced by a more complementary player. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni knows a little bit about star combinations not living up to expectations. He had Anthony and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire with the Knicks, as well as Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard with the Lakers. The latter group was hindered by injuries, but the New York pairing was clearly a bad fit. Even the year the Knicks won 54 games under Mike Woodson, the team was outscored when Anthony and Stoudemire were on the floor together. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that go into it,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said last week about the success or failure of star combinations, making it clear that he wasn\u2019t talking about anybody in particular. \u201cDo their skills complement each other instead of overlap? Are they both ball-stoppers instead of ball-movers? \u201cGolden State has four All-Stars, but they all complement each other and they\u2019re all willing to give up a part of their game. They\u2019re all willing to adjust and just do whatever it takes to win on the floor. It\u2019s an easy thing to [talk about], but a lot of times it\u2019s a hard thing to do. \u201cBut the biggest thing is that their games complement each other.\u201d D\u2019Antoni now has a new star combination in Houston, making his team look like the biggest threat to Golden State\u2019s four All-Stars, who they\u2019ll visit on the first night of the season.

Why can\u2019t the Knicks trade a second-round pick to the Thunder for Russell Westbrook? Hey, it would be a high pick! Thankfully, though, some questions are interesting. Last week, Katy Ng asked a question that no one had ever asked me before, and we\u2019ve been doing this a long time: And I thought that was a heck of a question. How does one determine excellence in a job that has no specific description, yet is essential to a successful franchise? The GM does so many things, yet his or her role is wildly different depending on the franchise, and what the owner allows. Some teams have a distinct separation of church and state between the GM and the coach: the GM and his staff, including the analytics group, handle everything off the floor, from scouting to trades to the Draft, and the coach works with the players they give them. (Consensus is sought in almost all cases, no good GM is going to give his or her coach a player the coach cannot stand.) This is how Boston does it, with president of basketball operations Danny Ainge running the front office, and Brad Stevens handling the on-court product. In other organizations, the coach has final say on everything \u2014 like Stan Van Gundy in Detroit and Tom Thibodeau in Minnesota. And in places like San Antonio, there\u2019s a hybrid structure, with Gregg Popovich and R.C. Buford jointly making the calls. But the best ever? Hey, it\u2019s a list; doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m right. So, let\u2019s rank \u2018em, from 10 to 1. Among the honorable mentions are: 10. Pat Williams, Philadelphia 76ers: In separate stints in Philly, Williams first brought big crowds to Sixers home games at the old Spectrum by bringing in show business elements between whistles, such as Victor the Wrestling Bear and other sideshows , with Williams taking the lessons he learned running minor league baseball teams, and from his friend, legendary White Sox owner Bill Veeck. After spending five years as GM of the Bulls and Hawks, Williams returned to Philly in 1974, and he built the 76ers into an NBA champion, starting with the acquisition of Julius Erving from the Nets , drafting point guard Mo Cheeks in the second round of the 1978 Draft , Andrew Toney \u2014 \u201cThe Boston Strangler\u201d \u2014 in the first round in 1980 , and trading for Moses Malone in 1982, creating the \u201cFo-Fo-Fo\u201d team that lost just one playoff game en route to the 1983 championship. Williams then joined the expansion Orlando Magic in 1986 and presided over the construction of the Magic into a title contender behind Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Penny Hardaway. 9. Jack McCloskey, Detroit Pistons: The late \u201cTrader Jack\u201d was hired by Detroit in 1979, the Pistons were nearing the end of a three-season stretch when they went 84-162. In the next decade, McCloskey brought numerous future Hall of Famers to the Motor City, starting with Isiah Thomas, the second pick of the 1981 Draft . McCloskey then traded for center Bill Laimbeer in 1982 . In 1983, he hired Chuck Daly as coach. In \u201985, he drafted little-known Joe Dumars from McNeese State. In \u201986, McCloskey drafted an even more obscure forward from Southeastern Oklahoma State in the second round, after taking John Salley in the first. The forward was Dennis Rodman . That summer, McCloskey traded for Adrian Dantley from Utah \u2014 and in \u201989, he dealt Dantley to Dallas for Mark Aguirre . That decade-long roll by McCloskey built one of the great teams of the decade, one that won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and made five straight conference finals. 8. Louis Mohs, Los Angeles Lakers: Very few today will recall the name. Mohs was a former football player (who played in the nascent days of the NFL in the \u201820s) and a newspaperman who was given the reigns of the Lakers in 1960. Owner Bob Short was moving his franchise from Minneapolis, where Mohs had worked for papers in the Twin Cities in circulation, and needed someone on the ground in L.A. to run the team. That, Mohs did. He drafted Jerry West in 1960 with the No. 2 overall pick to team with fellow future Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor, and hired West\u2019s college coach, Fred Schaus, to coach him in the pros. Equally importantly, Mohs was instrumental in helping to build interest in the Lakers in their early days in L.A., when they ran a distant third behind the Dodgers and Rams. Behind West, Baylor and Schaus, the modern Lakers\u2019 franchise emerged, making four Finals in the team\u2019s first six seasons out West. Because they never won a championship, a lot of people have forgotten Mohs\u2019s role in the franchise\u2019s storied history. 7. Jerry Colangelo, Phoenix Suns: In 27 years as the Suns\u2019 GM, beginning with the team\u2019s expansion season in 1968, Colangelo built several outstanding teams, almost always entertaining to boot, and was named NBA Executive of the Year four times. The Suns made the Finals in 1976 and in \u201993, with Colangelo engineering trades in each case that brought difference-makers \u2014 Paul Westphal in \u201975; Charles Barkley in \u201992 \u2014 to the Valley of the Sun. He took on even bigger responsibilities in 1987 when he put a group together that bought the Suns, making him the team\u2019s principal owner. There is no way that the NBA would have gone to Phoenix, or stayed there, if not for Colangelo\u2019s impact.  He sold the team to Robert Sarver for $401 million in 2004, but has had a third act along two tracks. Chosen managing director of USA Basketball in 2005 after embarrassing performances both at the World Cup of Basketball in 2003 and the 2004 Summer Olympics, Colangelo was given complete carte blanche to select the team himself and to improve USAB\u2019s relationships with Nike and other big players in basketball. He hired Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski as coach and engaged the NBA\u2019s biggest stars, restoring their desire to play internationally both to honor their country and as participants in one of the world\u2019s most exclusive clubs. Since Colangelo\u2019s ascension, the U.S. men have gone 88-1, winning the \u201908, \u201912 and \u201916 gold medals at the Olympics, and the \u201910 and \u201914 World Cups. As Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Colangelo has implemented several innovations since being elected chair in 2009, including direct election to the Hall for numerous players and contributors both from the ABA and from the pre-NBA early African-American teams. 6. Wayne Embry, Milwaukee Bucks\/Cleveland Cavaliers: The first African-American to get the opportunity to run teams, and a two-time NBA Executive of the Year (1992 and \u201998), Embry put competitive contending teams on the floor for two decades, in markets where he had next to no chance of luring free agents. Hired as the special assistant to the president in Milwaukee in 1970 after playing his last NBA season for the Bucks, it was Embry who convinced his former Cincinnati Royals teammate Oscar Robertson to accept a trade to Milwaukee . With the veteran Robertson and a young and dominant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Bucks won it all in 1971. Embry formally got the Bucks\u2019 GM job in 1972, but quickly had to adjust the roster on the fly when Abdul-Jabbar asked for a trade out of town the following year.  Embry dealt Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers in 1975, getting a package that included the first pieces to a new Bucks contender in guards Junior Bridgeman and Brian Winters. Embry gave Don Nelson his first coaching job as well, bringing him to Milwaukee as an assistant coach. Embry\u2019s 1967 and \u201977 Drafts brought in Quinn Buckner and Marques Johnson, but after Nelson became head coach in 1976, he and Embry had a falling out over personnel and control, and Embry stepped down as GM in 1978. Nonetheless, with Embry\u2019s players and coach serving as the Bucks\u2019 new foundation, Milwaukee averaged 55 wins a season from 1980-87 .  Embry then served as an advisor to the Pacers, and was hired as the Cavs\u2019 GM in 1986. Embry had not even officially been hired when he advised Cleveland\u2019s owners to pull the trigger on a deal that brought center Brad Daugherty, the top pick in that year\u2019s Draft , from Philadelphia. Embry then drafted guard Ron Harper and again advised his new bosses to get the Draft rights to guard Mark Price, a second-round pick in \u201986 . Cleveland then added forward John (Hot Rod) Williams, whom the Cavs had taken the year before, but who was not allowed to sign until he was cleared of any wrongdoing in a point shaving scandal at his college, Tulane University. The next year, Embry hired Lenny Wilkens as coach, and acquired Larry Nance in a trade with Phoenix for guard Kevin Johnson, whom Embry had drafted in the first round in \u201987. The whirlwind of moves almost immediately turned the Cavs into a juggernaut. Cleveland went from 31 wins to 57 in two seasons, and made the playoffs eight times in nine years, including the Eastern Conference finals in 1992.  Daughtery made five All-Star teams and Price made four. But, like everyone else in the conference during that generation, Cleveland couldn\u2019t beat Jordan. As the team aged, Embry again rebuilt a playoff team, this time behind guard Terrell Brandon, forwards Chris Mills, Danny Ferry and the late Bobby Phills, and young center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, another Embry first-rounder taken in 1996. Embry went to Toronto in 2004, where he\u2019s held a variety of roles, most recently the Raptors\u2019 senior advisor. 5. Pat Riley, Miami Heat: After winning four titles as coach of the Showtime Lakers in the \u201880s, and making the Knicks into a rugged, take-no-prisoners outfit that gave Michael Jordan\u2019s Bulls their greatest playoff competition, \u201cRiles\u201d nonetheless was unsatisfied when he faxed in his resignation as Knicks\u2019 coach in 1995. He wanted complete control of a franchise, and Miami owner Micky Arison gave it to him, naming him president and head coach of the Heat in 1995. Riley quickly pumped life into what was thought to be an impossible market for pro basketball; just a couple of months into his tenure in Miami, he acquired All-Star center Alonzo Mourning from Charlotte , and built a contender around the future Hall of Famer. The Heat couldn\u2019t get past the Bulls in the playoffs, though, and Riley resigned as coach in 2003. But he was still in charge, which he proved that summer a year later by prying Shaquille O\u2019Neal from the Lakers. With Dwyane Wade, who Riley drafted in 2003, the Heat again rose to the top of the East. Riley went back to the bench in 2005 after Stan Van Gundy resigned (there\u2019s always been some sentiment that Stan Van jumped before he was pushed), and Riley won a fifth ring as a coach in 2006. Yet he quickly deconstructed that team, too, setting forth his most audacious plan \u2014 luring LeBron James from Cleveland in 2010 to form a super team on South Beach, and being willing to patiently wait for three years for the chance. And Riley pulled it off, getting James and adding Chris Bosh from Toronto with Wade to create the Super Friends \u2014 which won it all in 2012 and \u201913, and made The Finals the other two years James was in town before going back home in 2014. 4. Jerry Krause, Chicago Bulls: Bouncing back and forth between baseball and basketball throughout five decades as a scout and executive, Krause\u2019s road to NBA fame came in his second stint running the Bulls, starting in 1985. The Bulls had already drafted Michael Jordan, but Chicago didn\u2019t have much surrounding him. Krause changed that, and built one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history. On Draft night 1987, he acquired the rights to a little-known former manager of his basketball team from Central Arkansas named Scottie Pippen, then took power forward Horace Grant with the 10th pick overall . (With the 1989 first-rounder that Krause got from Seattle as part of the Pippen trade, he took guard B.J. Armstrong.) Krause then ensured Jordan\u2019s animus by trading his friend and on-court protector, rugged Charles Oakley, to New York for center Bill Cartwright. In just a few month\u2019s time, Krause altered the trajectory of his club to due north. Pippen and Grant became the league\u2019s best pair of two-way forwards, versatile and lethal defensively while also being able to contribute at the other end. A Krause favorite, guard John Paxson, became a clutch shooter. Jordan, of course, was Jordan. And Krause\u2019s greatest decision, hiring Phil Jackson as an assistant coach and then promoting him to coach in 1991 , was the final master stroke. Jackson challenged Jordan\u2019s individual instincts, insisting he could still dominate and win while trusting his teammates to hold up their end of the bargain. And that group coalesced, finally vanquishing arch-rival Detroit in 1991 en route to the first of six NBA titles in eight seasons. Jordan famously went on a two-year baseball sabbatical in \u201994 and \u201995, but when he returned to the NBA, Krause had put another stellar group of role players around him, starting with the unlikely Dennis Rodman. But Rodman, center Luc Longley and guard Steve Kerr all filled their roles perfectly, and the Bulls pulled off a second threepeat from 1996-98. It wasn\u2019t all Krause\u2019s doing, but it wouldn\u2019t have happened without him. 3. Gregg Popovich\/R.C. Buford, San Antonio Spurs: It\u2019s hard to know where Pop ends and Buford begins, but they\u2019ve been in charge in San Antonio for two decades and the proof is in the winning: the Spurs have five NBA titles since the two of them came to town, and they\u2019ve been the winningest team in all of professional sports during that time. Yes, Pop and Buford were the decided beneficiaries of having consecutive Hall of Fame big men in David Robinson and Tim Duncan in San Antonio. That cannot be ignored. But they\u2019ve nonetheless found not only the right talent to surround them, but people with the right temperament. The Spurs not only were among the first teams to go around the world for players, but were the first to understand that finding that kind of cultural, historical and emotional diversity was a goal in and of itself. The Spurs have reinvented themselves so many times I\u2019ve lost count (Halfcourt Defense Strangler Spurs became Feed Duncan Spurs became Pace-and-Space Spurs became Kawhi Postup Spurs), but they always manage to see the curve before everyone else. Take Becky Hammon, a great player who was rehabbing an injury in San Antonio at the end of her career. It\u2019s not that Popovich and Buford were any smarter in seeing that Hammon knew the game; that was obvious. What they did see was that her perspective, her ability to teach, her ability to lead and her ability to fit in despite her pedigree meant her gender was not only not disqualifying, it was a positive. There will surely come an end to San Antonio\u2019s run as the standard all other NBA organizations seek to emulate (Oklahoma City, Utah, New Orleans, Indiana \u2026 so many teams have Spurs tentacles). But for two decades, the Spurs\u2019 market size hasn\u2019t mattered. Their \u201cboring\u201d style hasn\u2019t mattered. Their lack of controversy hasn\u2019t mattered. There are, always, R.C. and Pop, joined at the hip, disagreeing when they no doubt do on occasion in private, setting the tone. Everything else falls into place. 2. Jerry West, Los Angeles Lakers: Some have won more titles as players or executives, but no one in the history of the league has been as great a player and exec as The Logo. He was a Hall of Fame guard for the Lakers; he was a Hall of Fame GM for the Lakers. Yes, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was already there when West joined the team\u2019s front office in 1979, after a three-year stint as coach. And there is considerable anecdotal evidence that West wanted to take Sidney Moncrief with the first overall pick that L.A. had in 1979 instead of Magic Johnson. But West was smart enough to be convinced otherwise by his boss, Jerry Buss, and once West was officially named GM in 1982, he spent much of the next decade putting a championship-caliber team around his Hall of Famers \u2014 drafting James Worthy in 1982 (and resisting Buss\u2019 desire to trade Worthy to Dallas for Roy Tarpley and Mark Aguirre in 1987); taking Byron Scott out of Arizona State with the fourth pick overall in 1984; drafting A.C. Green near the end of the first round the following year; trading for Mychal Thompson in 1987. Just about every move wasn\u2019t just good, it was great, laying the foundation for the Showtime Lakers. They won five titles between \u201979 and \u201988 and became the equal of the Celtics as the NBA\u2019s signature franchises. After Magic\u2019s HIV disclosure in 1991, and the natural aging of his championship team, West lay low for a couple of years. But he came roaring back in 1996. Kupchak was officially the Lakers\u2019 GM by then, but West \u2014 officially executive vice president of basketball operations \u2014 still had the juice and the final say. He outmaneuvered everyone for an 18-year-old kid from Lower Merion High School in Philly that had, in West\u2019s words, the greatest pre-Draft workout he\u2019d ever seen. Through persuasion, threat, whatever was handy, West got Kobe Bryant. And that summer, he went all in to get free agent behemoth Shaquille O\u2019Neal from Orlando, gambling he could reach the big man. He did. And when the Lakers hired Phil Jackson to coach them, the path was laid for a championship. The Lakers ripped off three straight from 2000-02. West left that year to become the GM of the Grizzlies, who\u2019d never done much winning before he got there; he coaxed Hubie Brown out of the TV booth, and Brown won Coach of the Year in 2004, the same year West won his second NBA Executive of the Year award. After leaving Memphis in 2007, West was scarfed up as an advisor by the Warriors in 2011, where he again made his mark by standing firmly against a proposed deal to send Klay Thompson to Minnesota for Kevin Love, and then playing a key role in Golden State\u2019s successful recruitment of Kevin Durant in 2016. After six years with the Dubs, West was off again last summer \u2014 back to L.A., where he\u2019ll be Consigliere or anything else that Steve Ballmer needs. Forty-three years after he retired as a player, West\u2019s word is still gold around the NBA. 1. Red Auerbach, Boston Celtics: Auerbach\u2019s reign as the architect of almost all of Boston\u2019s 17 NBA titles remains the standard by which all other bosses are judged. He had complete control over the Celtics roster as the team\u2019s coach and GM from 1950 through 1984 (he retired as coach following the 1966 season, but kept the GM title another 18 years). In his first season in Boston, he reluctantly (Auerbach thought him too small) took Bob Cousy in the dispersal draft of the long-forgotten Chicago Stags. History shines upon the lucky as well. Auerbach drafted Frank Ramsey, Cliff Hagan and Jim Loscutoff between 1953 and \u201955; Ramsey and Hagan became Hall of Famers. Then Auerbach had himself a day on April 30, 1956, the date of that year\u2019s Draft. He took Tommy Heinsohn in the first round; Heinsohn went on to the Hall of Fame. He took K.C. Jones in the second round; Jones went on to the Hall of Fame. Then, Auerbach traded Hagan and Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks for the Draft rights to William Felton Russell, out of the University of San Francisco. Look at that again: Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Bill Russell. In one day. All those maneuverings, added with a couple of other shrewd moves, like drafting John Havlicek in 1962, created the league\u2019s greatest dynasty, a team that won nine NBA championships in a row between 1958 and 1967, and 11 titles in 13 seasons. That run alone would make Auerbach the best executive ever. Except he was just getting started. In 1968, he drafted Don Chaney. In 1969, he drafted JoJo White. In 1970, he drafted Dave Cowens. He got Paul Silas in a trade in 1972. With Heinsohn now coaching, the Celtics won two more titles in 1974 and 1976. That\u2019s 13 rings that Auerbach was directly responsible for bringing to Beantown. And, he wasn\u2019t done yet. In 1978, Auerbach took a \u201cjunior eligible\u201d player with the sixth pick in the Draft. The player had the right to return to college for his senior season under the existing rules, and the Celtics had a year to sign him; if they failed to do so, he\u2019d go back into the 1979 Draft. Auerbach finally got him to commit to Boston after he\u2019d taken his team to the NCAA national championship game. Larry Bird was worth the wait. With Bird on the team, the Celtics went from 29-53 in 1978-79 to 61-21 the following year, losing to Philly in the Eastern Conference finals. That year, Auerbach pulled off what might have been his greatest sleight of hand. He had traded Bob McAdoo, a prodigious scorer, to the Detroit Pistons in 1979, in exchange for forward M.L. Carr and Detroit\u2019s first-round pick in 1980. Unfortunately for Detroit, its season fell apart; the Pistons fired their head coach, a gent named Dick Vitale, and won only 16 games in \u201979-\u201980. Their pick became the first pick overall in the Draft, and Boston now had it. Which meant Auerbach had something up his sleeve. He found his quarry in Oakland, where the Warriors had a young but inconsistent center named Robert Parish that Auerbach wanted. So he dealt the first overall pick to the Warriors for Parish and their first-round pick, which was third overall. With that pick, Auerbach drafted\u2026Kevin McHale. Of course, Bird, Parish and McHale all wound up in Springfield. With his \u201cBig Three\u201d in place for Coach Bill Fitch (and, later, K.C. Jones), and guard Dennis Johnson, yet another acquisition of Auerbach\u2019s, in 1983, the Celtics won three more titles in the \u201880s; that made a total of 16 championships over a 28-year stretch for which Auerbach was directly responsible. He had acquired every player. He had coached most of them. He was the first NBA exec to draft an African-American player (Chuck Cooper, in 1950: he was the first NBA exec to hire an African-American as head coach (Russell, who was player-coach his last three NBA seasons, from 1966 to 1969). Arnold Auerbach knew how to put great teams together, because he had a way with people. Nobody\u2019s done as well before or since. * * * MORE MORNING TIP: 24 questions for 2017-18 | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | DA\u2019s Mailbag: Kobe over LeBron? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Yes, they don\u2019t have a big sample size of Nurk in the middle, and, yes, they have a zillionaire owner who won\u2019t lose anyone because of money, But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting Mark Cuban have a whack at recruiting this guy next summer. 14.

Twenty straight playoff appearances? Meh. A player who was third in MVP voting and just turned 26? Pfft. Up 21 on the champs in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals when that player went down for the rest of the series? Bah. It\u2019s been a part of us as basketball fans for the last decade: We look past, around, and through the Spurs. There\u2019s Kawhi, but what else does this team have? Their second-best player, LaMarcus Aldridge, was not good enough last season to dream of toppling the Warriors. Over the summer, Aldridge took the first step in refinding his All-NBA Portland-self when he \u201c spilled his heart \u201d to coach Gregg Popovich. Aldridge has been searching for Aldridge since he signed with San Antonio two seasons ago. This offseason, he revealed what he was truly feeling to Pop \u2014 essentially, the message was: \u201cI spent nine years in Portland as the focus of the offense and I\u2019ve had trouble acclimating.\u201d During the preseason, Pop sounded empathetic to LA\u2019s offensive obstacles. I suppose the idea is to get Aldridge going earlier in games like the championship Heat did for Chris Bosh. If Pop has prioritized LA\u2019s involvement, it must mean he knows Aldridge has another level. With their focus squarely on the Warriors, San Antonio\u2019s biggest offseason move was signing Rudy Gay (2016-17: 18.7 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 2.8 apg, 1.5 spg). To put it mildly, Rudy has always been a highly scrutinized player. He\u2019s never had a lot of team success as a lead guy but the numbers have always been there, and last season in Sacramento was no exception. He was efficient while shooting above average from three (37.2 percent). On a bad team. He\u2019s now coming off the bench with a fantastic team. It reminds me of Andre Iguodala \u2014 never a ton of playoff success as the man in Philly, but the Swiss Army role with the Warriors has been his calling. Like Iggy, Gay can also unlock the Spurs\u2019 version of smallball: Parker\/Patty-Green-Kawhi-Gay-Aldridge. Rudy\u2019s solid on both ends, he\u2019s another body to throw at Durant, and he exemplifies the perfect four in today\u2019s NBA. What can go sideways (other than facing the Warriors)? Ball-handling. A healthy Tony Parker would help, and even if Danny Green tells us Parker is ahead of schedule, we can\u2019t really know he\u2019ll be the same as he was in the 2017 playoffs until we watch him in the 2018 playoffs. He\u2019s 35 and coming off a major injury. Along with TP, Kawhi isn\u2019t healthy, and Gay isn\u2019t 100 percent. Manu Ginobili mentioned the team won\u2019t \u201cstart full throttle\u201d on opening night and the bench will have to play a big role early in the schedule. Luckily, San Antonio has had the NBA\u2019s best bench in three of the last four seasons (Golden State was the other. They\u2019ll likely be 1-2 come April). If San Antonio gets off to a slow start in the cutthroat West, that means they\u2019ll likely finish behind the Rockets and\/or Thunder in the standings. That is not a recipe for success \u2026 There I go, underestimating the Spurs again."},{"id":43754,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-week-begins-oct-16-2017","date":"2017-10-16","title":"Golden State Warriors week on NBA TV","content":"As Golden State begins defense of its 2017 NBA championship, we celebrate the Warriors all week with special features on NBA.com and special programming on NBA TV.

While players have joined new teams, coaches have new rosters to work with and general managers continue to try to put the perfect roster together ahead of the upcoming season, there is another group of the NBA family that is also preparing for the 2017-18 campaign \u2013 the league\u2019s referees. Veteran official James Capers offers a glimpse into his summer to discuss his offseason regimen as well as his first trip to Africa with Basketball Without Borders.  What started as a conversation with NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum years ago turned into one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, as I was able to make my first trip to Africa as part of Basketball Without Borders . Basketball Without Borders is the program that the NBA has put in place to spread the game around the world. They\u2019ve used coaches, they\u2019ve used players but the final piece of the puzzle was to include the referees. So now the referees in the NBA are being used more and more in the BWB program to perform clinics and teach\/instruct the officials in these countries the fundamentals of officiating and how to be better officials. Its very important because coaches are teaching the players the fundamentals based on the rules of the game, so what better way to foster the progress of the players, than teaching the local refs so they can enforce the rules properly. This will reinforce all the skills the coaches are teaching and increase the learning curve of the players to prepare them to perform in game situations and the game can be played the right way. We held clinics with a group of 14 African referees and started with something very elementary as far as teaching them our NBA mechanics (floor positioning) and our philosophy as to when we rotate and when we don\u2019t rotate. After teaching them those philosophies on how to put yourself in the best position to see plays, we then watched them work games. As we were observing the local refs we would notice some weaknesses or areas that we thought they could improve upon, and during timeouts and quarter breaks, we would go out and share that information with them. Over the course of a three-day period, the growth from day one to day three was remarkable. It was a slight challenge to critique the work of those officials because they can never see the game the same way that referees in the NBA see it. The experience gap is just too wide. But we\u2019re used to critiquing our peers and having our peers critique our work. NBA officials are used in grass roots programs as well as the Las Vegas, Orlando and Utah Summer Leagues, where we have a mentorship program in place to help the up and coming refs with aspirations of making it to the G League and the G League referees trying to make it to the NBA.  The great thing about officiating is that it\u2019s a brotherhood, a sisterhood where we\u2019re always trying to teach those with the same dreams all NBA refs once had. If a prospective ref is really interested in learning and they are able to get in contact with us, whether they live in our area or they meet us at a camp or meet us at a speaking engagement, we always try to leave some valuable referee knowledge of the game behind for them to be better. If there is a relationship that has developed, then we have a mentoring mindset to always help them, have them send us tapes so we can kind of engage with them. Be available by email or telephone whenever they have questions about their particular games. Now, in addition to the work we do with our fellow officials here in America, we have established relationships with officials halfway around the world that we can help mentor and continue to help grow the game. The African officials we worked with in the clinics came to the charity game that was played by the NBA players and got to see Zach Zarba and I work the game. Afterward they made it their business to wait outside the dressing room for us, they just wanted to say thank you for spending the time over the past couple days with them. They wanted our jerseys, they wanted our sneakers, and it was kind of heartwarming that they looked up to us that way. Another moment that really stood out was at the end of our classroom clinic, they asked if they could have our email addresses and before I even got back to the United States, five or six of them had already emailed saying thank you and wanted to know if it was alright if they can email during the season. I immediately emailed them back and said that wouldn\u2019t be a problem and I\u2019m sure Zach has probably done the same thing. I feel that we\u2019re only scratching the surface of what officials can do within the Basketball Without Borders program. Its just amazing because I had approached Mark Tatum with this probably three or four years ago about how important it is to involve the referees and how we can really expand the game if we can involve that last piece of the puzzle. I always look at the NBA game and say there are three pertinent parts that make this game fabulous. When you go to a game you have the players that are playing, coaches on the sideline and then you have those three officials. When we are all doing our job in concert it is a beautiful game to watch. Mark agreed to the point that he really pushed the initiative to get the referees more involved and I actually saw him after we got back and he can\u2019t believe how things are growing with our involvement. He thinks it was long overdue and that it has been great for the game. As rewarding as being a part of the BWB clinic was, the trip also afforded me the opportunity to visit South Africa (Johannesberg, Port Elizabeth and Capetown) for the first time and I came away with some extraordinary memories. I had always hoped maybe one day I would get the opportunity to go to Africa, but I had never really thought it would happen, so to go on this trip, just served a greater meaning personally for me because it was a dream come true. It was just amazing to meet so many Africans from all over the continent. I met people from South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda and the Congo and more. During breaks I was able to have conversations with all these folks and learn the history of their country, the history of Apartheid, some of the bad things that are going on over there, but then also a hope of promise for the future. I have since looked at the difference of social struggles Africans have gone through there versus us here in America. It was indeed a historical trip for me. What stood out the most for me was a trip to the Apartheid Museum. I really saw just how terrible an act of injustice was put upon blacks in Africa. The other emotional moment was the visit to the prison on Robben Island to actually see the prison cell that held Mr. Nelson Mandela. Those were just the two highlights of the trip that were life-changing experiences. I have been changed by this experience. Meeting so many African people, learning the history of Nelson Mandela and also learning about the past and current struggles of the black African people was amazing. The African people have a word they use quite often and its \u201cresistance\u201d. It\u2019s interesting because resistance to me as an American and resistance to them are two totally different things. I learned and understand their meaning of resistance is, how do you use your mind to overcome obstacles in a non-violent way. I live in Chicago and I see resistance in another form and its normally in violence and aggression. I have so much respect for what the African people have been through as human beings and how they are faithfully trying to overcome everything that is part of their past. After returning from Africa, it was time to start preparing for the upcoming season. Having been an official for more than 20 years now, my offseason routine is pretty much set. I can break it down into three parts. The first thing all refs have to do is take care of their body. Depending on when your season ends \u2013 my last game was Game 2 of the NBA Finals \u2013 I think everybody needs to take a few weeks off just to get over the aches and pains of the season and just to unwind from the mental pressure of the season. Once you\u2019ve got your rest, then its time to get back to work and prepare for the upcoming season. A big part of that is conditioning. I make sure I work out four days a week \u2013 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday \u2013 and I do two days with a trainer and two days without to make sure I\u2019m on the right path to get me where I need to be physically when training camp arrives. The second thing that all the men and women on our staff do is study videotape from all of our games last season and review our own work. Between that and our end of year reviews where we get some constructive criticism as to areas where we can improve, then we transfer that onto the court because a lot of us work summer league basketball games. Now nothing will ever prepare you for the NBA, but I live in Chicago, so this summer, me, Marc Davis, Danny Crawford, Nick Buchert and James Williams, we all worked some of the summer league games just to work on the craft and work on some of those weaknesses that were pointed out to us. The final step is the mental preparations for the upcoming season. I start the second week of August, because we usually go to training camp in the second week of September, and I get back in the rulebook, the casebook and the official\u2019s manual. I study these books every day to prepare for training camp, preseason exams and discussion session with other staff refs to get ready for preseason games. I\u2019ve saved tests and exams from previous training camps so I\u2019ll go back and review those 50 question and 100 question exams just to mentally get ready for the season. When you combine those three things that pretty much takes up nearly all of the offseason. And really to that point \u2013 it really is not an offseason. Just like players are working on new moves and working on their skills, coaches are working on strategy based on the players they\u2019ll have on their upcoming roster, we\u2019re no different as we\u2019re always trying to get better and hone our craft as professionals. You have to have an incredible work ethic to make it as an official in the NBA and I have two of the best examples to follow. My father, Jim Capers Sr., refereed in the league for 24 years before I got in, so my father is continually pushing me to be better and better and never get comfortable with my position. The other is Danny Crawford, he lives here in Chicago, and he recently retired this past season. These two men have been the biggest influences in my career. Danny Crawford is probably one of the best \u2013 if not the best \u2013 official that has ever refereed in the NBA. He\u2019s been a mentor of mine and I have always said if Danny is out there working summer league games then I better be out there. It was no way he would outwork me in the summer by working more summer league games than me. I just think it\u2019s a credit to the hard work he put into the profession and I\u2019m certain a lot of that has brushed off on me. While my father did this job for 24 years, he doesn\u2019t call me and point our any mistakes that I may have made or things I could have done better. He is my father and he is more of a motivator or encourager instead of a harsh critic of my work and I appreciate and love him for being there for me. He has always told me never ever get relaxed with the position that you have on this staff; you have to always want to be better. I remember it was six years ago when I made it in the Finals, the one thing he said, just because you\u2019re there don\u2019t ever get comfortable. That\u2019s another reason that I work in the summer the way I do and during the season, there is not a game I worked where I don\u2019t go back and watch the video tape and critique my work. My father always taught me: be your own worst critic. Be so hard on yourself that you\u2019re never content with your performance. So I\u2019m always looking for the perfect game even though I won\u2019t be able to attain it. But I\u2019m always nitpicking so even when I have really good games to always try to find something that could have made me better that night. We just finished our annual training camp and the biggest takeaway from that are the points of education for the upcoming season and new rules that will need to be administered. We have to make sure everyone on our staff understands the rule and how to implement the rules so that we\u2019re not going in different directions. One of the disadvantages is that we don\u2019t have an office that we report to and we all live all over the country. So this is the only time that we\u2019re able to get together and be in front of our bosses and their bosses to really get messages across as to where we are as a staff, how we can get better as a staff, what are the analytics showing from last season, what are areas that we can improve upon, what members on the staff are going to be crew chiefs, how can they be better leaders as crew chiefs. A lot of the information is given to us from the points of education, to any new rules, to breakout sessions to deal with leadership and how we can be better leaders. That\u2019s really tough when you\u2019re talking about 62 people that are the best at what they do in the world. Obviously all of us are leaders but there has to be something that makes some of us a step above others but do it in a respectful manner. There are a lot of things that we have to grow mentally and emotionally with that is consumed during training camp. Now we\u2019re only a few weeks away from the preseason and its time to get back to the grind of another season. This will be my 23rd in the NBA \u2013 just one shy of my father \u2013 and I\u2019ve put myself in a position to make it my best one yet."},{"id":43755,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-shootaround-oct-15-2017","date":"2017-10-15","title":"Shootaround (Oct. 15) -- Richard Jefferson's departure tied to Dwyane Wade's arrival in Cleveland","content":" This morning\u2019s headlines: Jefferson\u2019s departure tied to Wade\u2019s arrival \u2014 On Saturday, the Cavs traded Richard Jefferson and Kay Felder to Atlanta in order to both clear roster space and lower their luxury tax bill.

They want the product on the floor, but you\u2019re just seeing a lot of injuries throughout the league,\u201d said Kidd, whose team was without big man Greg Monroe (left calf soreness) and wing Brandon Rush (right hamstring strain) against the Pistons at the BMO Harris Bradley Center Friday. > Blogtable: Would fewer games benefit NBA? > Aschburner: Change needed on \u2018replay timeouts\u2019? > 2017-18 Kia Season Preview of all 30 teams A number of NBA players have suffered injuries this preseason, though data isn\u2019t readily available to determine if the rate is greater or less than past preseasons. Two years ago, in a USA Today story , Kidd was one of the coaches who said the traditional preseason schedule of eight games was too many. He recalled the post-lockout scrambles of 1998 and 2011, when each team squeezed in just two, and said: \u201cNo one complained.\u201d This season, Milwaukee ranks near the top among the league\u2019s 30 teams in continuity, determined by percentage of returnees from last year\u2019s roster. The teacher in him, though, sounds as if more classroom time is still needed. \u201cThe cards are dealt,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cI keep talking about how we just want to get out of this healthy.\u201d Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy, asked about his team\u2019s experience with the shortened preseason, said: \u201cI\u2019m rushed. I\u2019m looking at my list of things I still haven\u2019t talked about. But we\u2019re all in the same boat. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s something the league will keep an eye on. They\u2019re doing the best they can in the league office. This was thought out over time and they\u2019re trying to help the players. Whether that is a benefit or not, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d Both Kidd and Van Gundy said they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see raggedy play next week, based on the cutback in prep time. Van Gundy added: \u201cYou always do anyway. That part, I think, will be pretty normal.\u201d"}]
