This makes for a mob scene between now and Wednesday, when the season ends and everyone can breathe easier. Well, at least those teams that make the cut. * Playoff picture:  Tie-breakers, latest seedings and more Nobody\u2019 s completely safe headed into the weekend because nobody has managed to break from the seven-team pack that for now seems glued together. Unlike many teams at the bottom of the standings, these squads want to keep their season alive. With the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Utah Jazz all in the mix for seeds No. 4-8, somebody\u2019 s headed for disappointment (maybe even on the final day of the season). Why are there so many teams in this mix? Well, the Spurs likely wouldn\u2019 t be here if Kawhi Leonard were healthy, and same goes for New Orleans, perhaps, if DeMarcus Cousins wasn \u2019 t done for the year . The Clippers traded Blake Griffin at the deadline to free themselves from that gargantuan contract \u2014  a contract they gladly gave him just months earlier \u2014  and therefore this is the downside to that trade. And Minnesota has played the last month without Jimmy Butler , the leader and defensive ace of the young Wolves. The West, once again, has teeth and two teams with winning records will not make the playoffs. It\u2019 s a terribly deep conference that \u2019 s both top-heavy (Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets) and playoff bubble-heavy. Here\u2019 s a look at those who still have the right to dream about playing beyond Wednesday and some critical games between now and then: Remaining games:  Three (Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Key remaining game: Tuesday vs. Golden State Warriors ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass )  Since center Rudy Gobert returned, Utah is 28-7 (losing a pair to the Hawks) making the Jazz one of the NBA\u2019 s better teams since early January. Rather than retreat into the lottery after the first two months and when Gobert pulled up lame, they surged and fought their way to the thick of the race. Barring an unexpected collapse, they stand a decent chance at seeing their hard work pay off. Gobert \u2019 s return obviously helped Utah \u2019 s defense, which is the team \u2019 s main weapon. But the continued steady play of rookie Donovan Mitchell has also led the turnaround. Mitchell is the rare rookie who leads his team in scoring at 20.4 ppg and serves as the go-to guy in tight games. None of Utah \u2019 s three remaining opponents (Lakers, Warriors, Blazers) have anything on the line in those games and the last two could rest key players in preparation for the playoffs. Their doing that would only enhance Utah \u2019 s odds. This would be a semi-amazing run for a team that lost Gordon Hayward last summer and couldn \u2019 t help but feel bummed at the time. Remaining games:  Two (Monday, Wednesday) Key remaining game:  Wednesday at New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass )  The Spurs are looking to extend their playoff streak to 21 seasons, but it won \u2019 t come without some suspense and sweat, something the Spurs aren \u2019 t used to feeling this late in the regular season. Yes, it \u2019 s early April and instead of resting players, the proud Spurs are forced to push themselves to the limit. After they breathed life into their season at the end of March, a bad few days in Los Angeles where they blew a 19-point lead to the Clippers and swallowed a grapefruit against the undermanned Lakers put them back on the burner . Pau Gasol said their margin for error gets \u201c slimmer and slimmer, \u201d which is also the odds of Kawhi returning from his injury to rescue them down the stretch. As it is, the Spurs will not win 50 games for 19 straight years but that was fairly apparent since the All-Star break. LaMarcus Aldridge is doing his best Franchise Player impersonation and has had some monster games lately (35 points against the Clippers, 45 vs. Utah, 30 vs. Minny) but on the flip side, Tony Parker looks gassed (2 for 10 shooting in the two LA games). If their fate comes down to the final game, it \u2019 ll be in New Orleans against another team that could be fighting for a playoff spot, and here \u2019 s the deal: San Antonio has dropped 11 of 12 on the road. Remaining games:  Two (Monday, Wednesday) Key remaining game: Saturday at Houston Rockets ( Thunder won, 108-102 ) We\u2019ve spent the last six months trying to figure them out and guess what? Nobody has figured them out. Despite Russell Westbrook on pace to average a triple-double for the second straight season and Paul George giving an All-Star effort and the addition of Carmelo Anthony as a third scoring option, OKC sits on the playoff fence and gives no hint of what it \u2019 s capable of doing on a night-in and night-out basis, even here in April. This hot-cold personality will only hike the mystery about their playoff chances and\/or playoff seeding. They \u2019 ve lost five out of seven and the crusher was at home against the equally-desperate Nuggets , which raised an important question: What \u2019 s with George? He \u2019 s had some troubling shooting nights here in the stretch: 4-15 field goals vs. Portland, 4-12 vs. Denver, 5-19 vs. Golden State. That has forced Westbrook into old habits where he dominates the ball and loses trust in his teammates during crucial moments. More troubling is OKC \u2019 s defense; the Thunder have held only two team below 100 points since March 11 . Is this where they \u2019 re missing Andre Roberson? It would help if OKC got consistent production from the bench aside from Corey Brewer. The remaining schedule looks fairly favorable for OKC and it ends in Memphis, but again, this is a team that \u2019 s had some really bad L \u2019 s this season (Dallas twice, Phoenix, Brooklyn, Charlotte), so who knows? Remaining games:  Two (Monday, Wednesday) Key remaining games: Saturday at Golden State Warriors ( Pelicans won, 126-120 ); Monday at LA Clippers ( 10 ET, ESPN ); Wednesday vs. San Antonio Spurs ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass )  Remember when Anthony Davis was on fire and the Pelicans found themselves sitting in fourth place? Well, an untimely and potentially costly four-game losing streak pushed them to the edge until the Grizzlies showed up on the schedule . Such is life in the West. Now the Pelicans face a somewhat daunting three road games in four nights and then close at home against the Spurs who might have a reason to win that game. It\u2019 s the toughest finish of all the playoff contenders in the West, and it will rightly require a superb effort from Davis to carry them through. The Pelicans are getting steady direction from Rajon Rondo (10 assists average the last three games) and Jrue Holiday but the rest of the cast is unpredictable. Basically, Davis can \u2019 t afford to have a mild impact game, and lucky for New Orleans, those are rare for him. There \u2019 s probably more at stake for the Pelicans making the playoffs than most teams. If they fail, will there be major changes in the basketball operation? Or can coach Alvin Gentry and GM Dell Demps play their Boogie Cousins Got Hurt card and survive? Davis can spare them the drama by going Superman over the next few days and grabbing a playoff spot. Remaining games:  Two (Monday, Wednesday) Key remaining games: Wednesday vs. Denver Nuggets ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass )  Timberwolves. Maybe the real question regarding the Wolves is this: How in the heck did they find themselves in this spot in the first place? Yes, Butler\u2019 s injury was an obvious disadvantage , yet the Wolves with Tom Thibodeau, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins should be better than this. For some reason, this team seems to underachieve, which is why they\u2019re suddenly fighting for survival. Here\u2019s a fun fact: Since February 2 the Wolves have only beaten two winning teams (and one was the Warriors minus Steph Curry) , proof that Minny might not be ready to be lumped with the big dogs just yet. And, how do you lose to Memphis, as the Wolves did a week ago? The mental toughness needed for the playoffs needs improving. In addition, they\u2019re still not strong defensively and don\u2019t always close out games, and again, this is surprising given the reputation of their coach. The return of Jeff Teague will help and eventually so will Butler, now suiting up following a knee issue. Still, Minnesota needs more from a bench that hasn\u2019t helped much. Remaining games:  Two (Monday, Wednesday) Key remaining games: Monday at Portland Trail Blazers ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ), Wednesday at Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) Much like the Timberwolves, this team has too much talent to find itself on the fringe. Yes, Paul Millsap missing 43 games didn\u2019 t help, and Gary Harris sitting with knee issues only adds to their misery. But once Harris returns the Nuggets will be whole for the first time in a while. In the meantime, it \u2019 s up to Millsap, Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Will Barton to finish up strong. The Nuggets are a balanced scoring team that can turn to a few players in desperate times, mainly Murray and Jokic, but also lack the lead-singer type of player who can completely take over games. Jokic has been burning up the minutes (40 per over the last five games) and giving quality production at the rim and with his passing. The Nuggets have already ensured their first winning season since 2012-13, so progress has been made. Remaining games:  Two (Monday, Wednesday) Key remaining games: Monday vs. New Orleans Pelicans ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ) The Clippers\u2019 playoff hopes were dashed after losing to the Nuggets on Saturday, 134-115. LA faces plenty of questions this offseason. Unfortunately for them, several decisions must wait until DeAndre Jordan decides whether to opt into his 2018-19 player option. Ditto for Milos Teodosic, Austin Rivers and Wesley Johnson. In light of pivoting away from \u201cLob City,\u201d the Clippers\u2019 resilience was admirable this season. Lou Williams is an elite scorer on an extremely friendly contract. The question is where LA goes from here after missing the postseason for the first time since 2011. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The man who says he\u2019s aged like \u201cfine wine\u201d is putting the finishing touches on what is arguably his finest regular season to date, given all that the Cleveland Cavaliers have endured since Kyrie Irving asked out of town last summer . And his continued defiance of Father Time has forced honesty out of the calculated superstar, one who always battled the urge to say what we all know to be true (as opposed to what is politically correct). So maybe we shouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow when he declares that if he had a vote for Kia MVP this season, he\u2019d vote for himself . If you had done what he has this season, who would you vote for? Even when someone points out that the Houston Rockets\u2019 James Harden is the no-brainer pick for Kia MVP this season, they can\u2019t finish the sentence without acknowledging the fact that LeBron is every bit as deserving \u2014 just as he is basically every year. Washington Wizards coach Scott Brooks was in the unique position of having to try and stop them both this week. First, his team faced Harden \u2014 a player Brooks coached from 2009-12 in Oklahoma City \u2014 on Tuesday night . Then came a Thursday night matchup with James and Co. on TNT. And he answered questions from reporters by endorsing Harden and then tipping his cap to LeBron in the same breath. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely an MVP this year,\u201d Brooks said of Harden. \u201cHe\u2019s played well on the team that\u2019s playing the best in basketball, but you can always argue LeBron [James] can get it every year. Like Michael Jordan should have had 12 of them. LeBron\u2019s the same type of player. He\u2019s having probably a better year than he had before, however many years he had.\u201d The longevity and consistency of the years LeBron has had is what makes his MVP case this year, and basically every year. He\u2019s played at an elite level for so long, it\u2019s hard for anyone to remember a time when he wasn\u2019t the first name that came to mind in a MVP dialogue. \u201cI think the thing for me, that defines him more than anything else is the mental toughness that it takes to do the things he does,\u201d said a former Eastern Conference general manager who worked in the Western Conference during LeBron\u2019s first stint in Cleveland. \u201cBy way of example, it\u2019s not impressive to me that a guy who\u2019s that talented and that ball-dominant would score 10 or more points 867 times in a row . \u201cAnd then you think about it and you say, \u2018hold on a second. That means 867 consecutive times he did not have some fluke thing happen in a game that took him off the court and took him away from his teammates.\u2019 He refuses to be stopped mentally. In a way, maybe Kobe [Bryant] was the only guy like this, and I think [Michael] Jordan had some of that ability as well.\u201d \u201cBut he goes to The Finals seven straight years. So that means seven straight years he has a shorter turnaround time than everybody else in the league and he\u2019s still in the gym working his [expletives] off in the offseason. So that part of him, that complete obsession he has with greatness and with being better all the time, that\u2019s the thing to me that\u2019s amazing to me.\u201d LeBron\u2019s ability to play through injuries and anything else that could have slowed him down is what resonates after all of these years. Even for a prospect as heralded as LeBron was as a high school phenom in Akron \u2014 all in the days before social media existed \u2014 it was hard to envision a career this long and accomplished back then. Sure, he had a chance to be great. Special even. But to spend this phase of his career smashing the competition, on the court and in the record books in every facet, is perhaps more than even the most optimistic of observers could have dreamed up. He\u2019s an elite player, competitor and human being who has impacted the game and the NBA culture in countless ways. And yet, the backbone of it all remains his quest for greatness that has never waned \u2014 not even for a moment \u2014 some 15 seasons later. The mountain of career milestones he\u2019s piled up this season , including his attempt to play all 82 regular season games for the first time, one sticks out more than any other for James. LeBron\u2019s 2,171 points (and counting) this season gives him the most for a player in NBA history in his 15th season or later, passing Bryant ( 2,133 in 2012-13 ). \u201cWe thought of him as like, a Magic Johnson with rockets in his [expletive] type than a guy who was going to carry the load scoring all the time,\u201d the former executive said, acknowledging that there were mixed opinions and plenty of skeptics who feared that any player in LeBron\u2019s position might struggle to live up to the hype. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s that kind of prolific as a scorer, when he wasn\u2019t natively that kind of shooter and it wasn\u2019t the easiest part of his game for him, that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s shocking to me,\u201d the former executive continued. \u201cThe scoring element that LeBron has, to be able to get triple-doubles when everyone is slanting their defense to stop you for the better part of the past 15 years, and you still find a way to do things like score 38 points and still dish out 17 or 18 assists in a meaningful game at 33 \u2026 it\u2019s otherworldly. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have thought he\u2019d be Michael plus Magic.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 25 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  30.7 points, 8.8 assists, 5.4 rebounds Harden needed Chris Paul to rescue him in the final seconds Thursday night as the Rockets prevailed over a Portland team playing without Damian Lillard to win their second straight game. Harden missed two free throws with 13.3 seconds to play as the Rockets held on after blowing a 24-point lead. For all that Harden has done this season to lift these Rockets to the best regular season in franchise history, even he is not above needing a helping hand sometimes. And that one-two point-guard punch is what will have to power this team heading into a postseason where they\u2019ll be the favorite every step of the way. Harden and Paul have already made the most significant adjustment \u2014 sharing the leadership load without sacrificing their games. But the pressure changes in the postseason, a space where they both have demons to exorcise. It helps, of course, to go into that part of the season an an absolute roll. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.4 points, 9.1 assists, 8.7 rebounds Once again, LeBron is making the rest of the competition in the Eastern Conference stress about what lies ahead in the playoffs. Thursday night\u2019s comeback win over Washington only confirms what foes know about whatever team LeBron is leading: they are never out of it with him around and enough time. He scored 13 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter, when the Cavaliers completed their comeback from a 17-point deficit to shock the Wizards. He missed key free throws late, yet still found a way to make all the right plays \u2014 especially on defense \u2014 to seal the win. It was just more of the sort of late-season work (he also had 14 assists and nine rebounds) that he\u2019s done against everyone, but particularly East contenders (Toronto twice in the past two weeks). Consider it a reminder to everyone that the road to The Finals still runs through wherever James calls home. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.1 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.5 blocks Wednesday night\u2019s blowout win against the Memphis Grizzlies couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Davis and the Pelicans, who halted a season-worst four-game losing streak. The magic number for the Pelicans to clinch just the second playoff berth of the Davis era is three, with four games remaining. Davis has to stay healthy and locked in to the finish to make sure the Pelicans get the job done. There is no other way it happens, not with road games remaining against Phoenix ( Friday ), Golden State ( Saturday ) and the LA Clippers ( Monday ) before wrapping up the regular season at home against the Spurs ( April 11 ). The last time Davis and the Pelicans saw the postseason, they needed a win over the Spurs (and a monstrous game from Davis) on the final night of the regular season to punch their ticket. It could come down to the exact same scenario this time around. No one knows that better than Davis, who is the only Pelicans starter leftover from that game that ended the 2014-15 season. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  27.6 points, 6.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds The Trail Blazers are \u201cbeing smart\u201d about the sprained left ankle Lillard suffered in Tuesday night\u2019s loss to the Dallas Mavericks. He was held out of Thursday night\u2019s game against Houston , with the Trail Blazers wisely not taking any chances with their superstar\u2019s health with their playoff position nearly locked in. The third seed is a much better position than anyone envisioned for this team before the season. Jeopardizing their opportunity to continue their shock-and-awe campaign in the playoffs makes no sense. They are three games ahead of the San Antonio Spurs and Utah Jazz with four games to play. That said, these Trail Blazers are not the same team without Lillard at the controls. But it\u2019s much more important to have him healthy and ready to go for the postseason than it is to have him risk doing any further damage to his ankle in one of their remaining games. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  26.5 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists Durant did what he could to try to extend the Warriors\u2019 win streak to four games, but it wasn\u2019t enough Thursday night against an inspired Indiana Pacers team . The Pacers won in a rout and in spite of Durant\u2019s 27 points, seven assists and five rebounds. Klay Thompson added 16 first-half points, but was shut out in the second half. It was proof of how difficult the first round of the playoffs could be for the reigning champs as they work to get all of their All-Stars and regular rotation players into a postseason groove. Durant is going to see defensive schemes focused on shutting him down until Stephen Curry (knee) can find his way back to the court, which isn\u2019t likely to come before the end of the first round. So there will be no easing into the action for Durant. The Warriors will need him strapped in from the start, in Finals MVP mode, to avoid any unnecessary drama against whoever they face in their first series. 6. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 7. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 8. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 9. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs 10. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers And five more: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves An inside look at Jamal Murray from an Eastern Conference advance scout: \u201cHe\u2019s such a salesman, so you always have to be careful how much you read into what [Kentucky coach John] Cal[ipari] says about his players. He\u2019ll have you believing his seventh and eighth man are going to be Rookie of the Year candidates in the league. But I have to give him credit, he warned us all about Jamal Murray. In the lead up to the 2016 Draft, he pounded the table hard for Murray and for Tyler Ulis, much the same way he did for Devin Booker before them. And he was right about all three of those guys. He nailed it. He said Murray was going to be a high-level scorer in our league, that he was the most dynamic offensive player in that Draft, and so far, he\u2019s lived up to that. Remember now, the debate was really between [Sacramento Kings guard] Buddy Hield and Murray, as to which one of them would be better. Hield went one spot ahead of Murray in that Draft but I think Murray\u2019s the better player right now and the better prospect moving forward. \u201cHe\u2019s able to play bigger than his listed size because of his length and he\u2019s more athletic than you realized. He\u2019s got a real knack for finding his sweet spots in that Denver offense, whether he\u2019s playing on or off the ball, and getting the shots he wants. That\u2019s a skill that takes years for some guys to master. Some guys never really get it and it keeps them from becoming the types of scorers and really players that their talent suggests they could be. Murray doesn\u2019t have that problem. He\u2019s got such a great feel for the game and how to get where he wants to get on the floor that it makes him a more effective player than you see at first blush. The more you see him and how he operates within that system, the more impressive he is. And we\u2019re talking about a guy that shoots it better than 38 percent from the 3-point line and bette than 91 percent from the free throw line. So he\u2019s a dangerous guy scoring the ball even when he\u2019s not shooting it at an extremely high level from the floor. He\u2019s got a natural feel for the game that will allow him to be special player in our league some day. I really believe that. He\u2019s a future star. \u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here and  follow him on Twitter .

Bojan Bogdanovic scored 28 points on a nearly perfect shooting night, Victor Oladipo added 21 and the Pacers pulled away from the short-handed defending champions for a 126-106 blowout \u2014 and their first season sweep of the Warriors since 2011-12. \u201cWe\u2019re the underdog in every matchup,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to continue to keep getting better. We still have room to get better, especially going into the playoffs.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine how much better the Pacers can play after dominating the three-time defending Western Conference champs, who played their seventh straight game without Stephen Curry due to a left MCL sprain. The Pacers shot better than the high-scoring Warriors inside and outside the 3-point line. They outrebounded Golden State and held Klay Thompson scoreless in the second half. They took the lead for good on Lance Stephenson\u2019s 3 with 9:46 left in the first half and never allowed Golden State to get closer than 10 after halftime. After falling into a 21-point deficit with 7:14 left, Warriors coach Steve Kerr pulled five players, including Kevin Durant, leaving them on the bench for the rest of the game before delivering his blunt postgame assessment. \u201cI think just caring, caring in general, that was the main problem,\u201d he said. \u201cJust in general, it\u2019s hard to win an NBA game if you don\u2019t put forth an effort at all. Yeah, I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m embarrassed. I know that this game doesn\u2019t mean anything in the seeding, but the playoffs start next week. It was an embarrassing effort, a pathetic effort.\u201d Indiana took full advantage. The Pacers became the first Eastern Conference team to sweep the Warriors since 2013-14. They earned their sixth win in seven games and their second in nine days over Golden State. Indiana also moved a half-game closer to supplanting Philadelphia for the No. 4 seed. Sure, the Pacers did all that against a team missing Curry, but that\u2019s something Golden State must solve. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to turn it on, especially when you\u2019re missing a guy like Steph,\u201d Shaun Livingston said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to challenge ourselves.

Cleveland\u2019s coach has been rewired by a serious health scare. Lue was back on the sidelines Thursday night and had his blood pressure tested as the Cavaliers rallied to win in his first game following a medical absence that became necessary after he experienced \u201cpiercing\u201d chest pains during two games this season. Now that he\u2019s feeling better, Lue even joked about his heart after the Cavs overcame a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter to stun the Washington Wizards 119-115 . \u201cI told the guys after the game, \u2018Good job of bailing me out.\u2019 It was tough,\u201d Lue said. \u201cFirst game back and not having a point guard and not knowing what sets to call and what to run because you haven\u2019t worked on it. Our rotations were a little off tonight so, I mean, I was rusty.\u201d Earlier in the day, Lue, who guided the Cavs to an NBA title in 2016, described his ordeal in some detail for the first time. Lue said he had been bothered by chest pains for more than a year, but when they worsened during a March 17 game in Chicago, he realized it was time to step away and get help. \u201cIt\u2019s just the chest pains are very piercing, like, through the chest and around the rib area. So, it feels like you\u2019re having a heart attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctor said, \u2018You might die, but it won\u2019t be from your heart.\u2019 So, that was a good thing to hear that my heart\u2019s in good shape. But it\u2019s just like electricity shooting through your body, through your chest area.\u201d After stubbornly thinking he could fight through symptoms, Lue changed his diet (\u201cNo Shirley Temples), is exercising more, hired a chef and is taking sleep medication. More important, he now realizes there are more important things than worrying about Cleveland\u2019s rotation, defending the pick and roll or getting the Cavs back to the NBA Finals. While he was out for nine games, Lue received sound advice from a colleague and rival \u2014 Golden State coach Steve Kerr, who has been sidelined in the past with debilitating back pain. Lue said Kerr helped him understand the bigger picture by putting his health first. \u201cWe get so wrapped up in the game of basketball I think we kind of forget about everything else,\u201d Lue said. \u201cThis was the first time in 20 years where I really just had a chance to focus on me and get myself right and he reminded of that. We get so wrapped up in the game that we forget about real life and it was the best advice I got \u2013 so thank Steve for that.\u201d The Cavs travel to Philadelphia on Friday and Lue said coaching against the Wizards will be a good test to make sure he\u2019s up for the rigors of travel and added stress. \u201cWe know the games will be late and it will be a little bit more difficult, but just with travel and being asleep on the road and I\u2019ve got to take my medication because sometimes I can be groggy in the first two or three hours when I wake up,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI just gotta get in a routine and seeing how that\u2019s going to feel.\u201d The Cavs, who have been ravaged by injuries all season, hardly missed a beat without Lue, going 8-1 under the direction of assistant Larry Drew. Lue has always trusted Drew, but he intends to lean on him even more as the Cavs head into their last four regular-season games before gearing up for the postseason. \u201cL.D. stepped up and did a great job,\u201d Lue said. \u201cAnd other coaches stepped up and they\u2019ve been doing a great job also. So, whatever I need them to do, they all just said, \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid to ask.\u2019 So, I\u2019m very excited just for the playoff push. I kind of wish I could skip these four games and go right to the playoffs because that excites me.\u201d Cleveland\u2019s players are thrilled to have Lue back. He recently returned in an advisory role, but stayed off the floor during games. Now that he\u2019ll be back in the huddle, the Cavs feel whole. \u201cHe challenges us,\u201d LeBron James said. \u201cHe\u2019s been with us. He\u2019s our championship head coach so he knows everything about our team. He knows how to get the best out of our players, even though we\u2019ve got a lot of new guys. But just his command, having him back out there. It\u2019s going to be good for us.\u201d Following his health issues in Chicago last month, Lue said owner Dan Gilbert, general manager Koby Altman and others in Cleveland\u2019s organization persuaded him it was time to seek help. Lue agreed, and then James comforted him with encouraging words. \u201cHaving LeBron\u2019s validation, just being like, \u2018I got it. Take some time off. Get yourself ready for the playoffs. I\u2019ll take care of the team. I\u2019ll make sure everything is good,\u201d\u2018 Lue said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s playing at a high level, so he\u2019s a man of his word.\u201d"},{"id":41041,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-plans-play-saturday-vs-san-antonio","date":"2018-04-06","title":"Report: Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard plans to play Saturday vs. San Antonio Spurs","content":"After misssing one game with a sprained left ankle, Portland Trail Blazers All-Star Damian Lillard says he\u2019s feeling better and intends to play Saturday against the San Antonio Spurs.

Of Boston\u2019s top seven scorers in its 18 playoff games in 2017, only Al Horford still is on the roster and\/or healthy. Horford is a logical answer here, a pillar of stability for the Celtics. But I\u2019m more interested in how guard Terry Rozier steps up in Irving\u2019s absence. Danny Ainge\u2019s favorite Celtic only averaged 16.3 minutes and 5.6 points in the playoffs a year ago, but he took on a bigger role this regular season. His minutes with Irving out should double what they were in 2017, and I\u2019d expect his scoring and assists to triple. Rozier is explosive enough to create some havoc on the court and in the opponents\u2019 game plan. Stability is big but Boston is going to need a serious X-factor going forward. Shaun Powell : The Celtics won\u2019t have a designated lead singer without Kyrie Irving because nobody has that qualification or experience in the NBA and some didn\u2019t even have it in college. If we must nominate someone, then the obvious answer is Jayson Tatum , whose shot attempts and crunch-time role have expanded lately. But again, as a rookie, Tatum has never played this deep into the basketball season or knows what playoff intensity is like. Boston\u2019s blueprint without Kyrie must be the \u201cby committee\u201d approach; anything else will prove deadly to the Celtics\u2019 chances of lasting very long. John Schuhmann :  First of all, lets marvel at the fact that Irving has attempted twice as many shots (101) in the clutch (score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime) as any teammate (Jayson Tatum is next with 51). But the answer is \u201cEverybody.\u201d The Celtics will ask Terry Rozier and (to a lesser extent) Tatum to create off the dribble, and they will work through multiple guys (Greg Monroe, Al Horford and Marcus Morris) in the post. If you look at the last 11 games (since Irving last played), usage rate has been pretty balanced , though their assist percentage (AST\/FGM) has been lower (56 percent, 24th in the league ) than it was prior (58 percent, 18th ). Morris has stepped up offensively, averaging 21 points on an effective field goal percentage of 55 percent in the nine games he\u2019s played, and Tatum, Rozier and Morris have shared clutch shots pretty evenly . Sekou Smith :  The leadership of this group has been handled all season by All-Star big man Al Horford, who has always been one of the league\u2019s best (and perhaps most underrated) in that department. But the Celtics will need a wild card in these playoffs, someone whose contributions will need to rise above the expectation of what he would normally be counted on to provide. Jaylen Brown\u2019s shown a penchant for stepping up and into the void when the Celtics have needed it this season and he\u2019s the guy I suspect will do the same in these playoffs. He\u2019s physically capable of holding his own at a couple of positions and will serve as the primary defender on the opposition\u2019s best perimeter offensive player. He\u2019ll have to tote more of a load this time around than you might be comfortable with for a second-year player. But I think he\u2019s more than up to the task and eager for the challenge. * * *"},{"id":41040,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-can-boston-celtics-advance-out-first-round-without-kyrie-irving","date":"2018-04-06","title":"Blogtable: Can Irving-less Boston Celtics advance out of the first round?","content":" * * * Let\u2019s say the rest of the Celtics\u2019 roster is healthy on April 14. Can they get out of the first round sans Kyrie Irving? * * * Steve Aschburner :  This might be purely hypothetical, because Marcus Smart\u2019s right thumb isn\u2019t likely to be healed and rehabbed fully by the start of the postseason. But I\u2019ll play along, in which case my answer is: yes, the Celtics can survive the first round and advance. Washington, Miami and Milwaukee are in the bottom half of the conference bracket for legitimate reasons. Boston is well-coached and would have enough talent at both ends to exploit the specific flaws of whichever of those teams \u2013 Wizards, Heat or Bucks \u2013 it winds up facing. The bigger question is, do we want to see the Celtics advance if they\u2019ll inevitably wind up overmatched and missing Irving in a subsequent round? We can\u2019t engineer outcomes, of course, but as the playoffs grind on, I\u2019d rather see a team with all its key pieces that might get better round by round, rather than one thinned by injuries that would have a built-in excuse. Boston vs. Cleveland, in particular, would be disappointing to endure with Irving watching in street clothes. Shaun Powell :  Can they get out of the first round? Yes, of course ; this team has played relatively well without Kyrie Irving and appear good enough to beat a No. 7 seed. Will they? Well, that depends on the matchup of course, with the wild card being the Wizards with a sharper John Wall; in that scenario, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see Washington finally develop a sense of consistency with its star guard back in the fold and pull off the win. Either way, I never saw this as being the Celtics\u2019 year even with a healthy Kyrie. Once Gordon Hayward went down, Boston had \u201c2018-19\u201d written all over it. And now, it\u2019s official. John Schuhmann :  First of all, I\u2019m assuming that \u201cthe rest of the Celtics\u2019 roster\u201d doesn\u2019t include Marcus Smart or Daniel Theis. No matter if\/when Smart returns, the Celtics can win a series . They\u2019re 12-6 without Irving and 6-5 without him against other playoff teams, with terrific defensive numbers in both cases. They still have great length on the wings, an elite defensive frontline in Aron Baynes and Al Horford, and a bulldog at the point in Terry Rozier. The question is whether there\u2019s enough offense there. A first-round series against any of the teams currently 6-8 in the East is probably close to a 50-50 prospect, though Washington is probably the team the Celtics would least like to face. Sekou Smith :  The first round is something the Celtics can manage even without Kyrie available . They\u2019re that good defensively, that well coached and plenty talented enough. It won\u2019t be easy. I didn\u2019t expect it to be if they had a reasonably healthy group heading into the postseason anyway, because the Celtics have some deficiencies (namely size and depth) that were going to be issues for them in the postseason. But they\u2019ve shown themselves to be a resilient bunch. This entire season, from the first five minutes of the season opener, has been about Brad Stevens and his ability to make the Celtics go, no matter who is available and in uniform. The Celtics have a framework that produces results for whatever combinations Stevens utilizes. I expect more of that in the first round of the playoffs, from Stevens and whatever healthy bodies he\u2019ll have at his disposal. * * *"},{"id":41021,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-orleans-pelicans-bring-back-guard-jordan-crawford","date":"2018-04-05","title":"New Orleans Pelicans bring back guard Jordan Crawford","content":"METAIRIE, La.

The ruckus that immediately followed was the sound of Celtics fans\u2019 jaws and hearts dropping, quickly drowned out by teams tripping over themselves to snag the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Finishing seventh would set up a first-round series against Boston\u2019s badly crippled roster, based on the Celtics essentially being locked into the No. 2 spot with only a handful of regular season games remaining . That should have Miami (43-36), Milwaukee (42-36) and Washington (42-36), currently sixth, seventh and eighth, scoreboard-watching and angling in what\u2019s left of their schedules to set up the preferred matchup. Remember, it\u2019s not just Irving without whom the Celtics must forge ahead. Guard Marcus Smart last played on March 11, same date as Irving, and has been on a six-to-eight-week recovering timeline since undergoing surgery on a torn tendon in his right thumb . And of course, All Star free-agent acquisition Gordon Hayward has been out all year since that gruesome left leg injury he suffered in the first five minutes of the season opener. The Heat, Bucks and Wizards collectively have gone 6-4 against Boston (with one meeting left at Washington Tuesday), so the prospect of taking four out of seven against a Celtics squad further weakened by injuries has obvious appeal. * Blogtable:  Who becomes Boston\u2019s go-to guy now? That\u2019s the short-term outlook for one of the constituents in this latest gloom-and-doom NBA injury story. Until now, most of the recent headline-grabbers \u2013 Joel Embiid\u2019s orbital fracture in Philadelphia , John Wall\u2019s knee , Kevin Love\u2019s hand , Jimmy Butler\u2019s knee , Golden State\u2019s various ailments and whatever has been going on with Kawhi Leonard \u2013 have allowed for returns in time for the postseason. This one does not, sending shivers through the league generally and the Celtics specifically. Some might see irony in the published reports that Irving allegedly threatened Cleveland last summer, claiming he would opt for season-ending knee surgery if the Cavaliers had not traded him when he wanted out. Others might at least see some measure of justice, based on how severe Isaiah Thomas\u2019 hip injury was found to be after Cleveland got him in the Irving trade. But the bottom line in basketball terms is that Boston suddenly will be without the services of its most potent and creative scorer, one of the NBA\u2019s best shot-makers and a guy who\u2019d already made his bones in three straight trips to the Finals, particularly in Cleveland\u2019s 2016 championship run. * Blogtable:  Can Kyrie-less Celtics get out of first round? If that\u2019s not necessarily a problem in the shortest term \u2013 it\u2019s not unreasonable to think the Celtics have enough talent and know-how to survive against a lower-seeded foe in the opening round \u2013 it almost certainly will become one in the midterm and potentially even in the long term. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up on this,\u201d Danny Ainge, Celtics president of basketball operations told the Boston Herald . But Ainge added: \u201cI\u2019ve been in the NBA a long time and I\u2019ve seen some traumatic injuries for our team, but never as many to as many key players as we\u2019ve had this year.\u201d The Celtics\u2019 prospects with a thinned rotation figure to get worse as the playoffs grind on and the competition gets better. That\u2019s really a problem if the winner of the Nos. 3-6 series is Cleveland. Sure, LeBron James might be deprived of a little extra juice in not going head-to-head, game after game, against the former sidekick who so wanted to put distance between them. But the Cavaliers happily will take that dip in individual motivation if it means avoiding Boston\u2019s most dangerous player. Then there\u2019s this: the longer-term concerns for the Celtics. Irving can opt out of the final year of his contract in the summer of 2019. Boston, presumably, sees the 26-year-old, five-time All Star as a cornerstone of a title contender for years to come. And yet, by the end of next week, Irving will have missed 117 of a possible 558 regular season games, or 21 percent, over his seven NBA seasons. Plus, most of the 2015 Finals and all of the upcoming postseason. His fragility is going to present the Celtics at least with some serious organizational risk. If the injuries continue, they could undermine Boston\u2019s plans entirely. One team\u2019s ordeals are other teams\u2019 opportunities, though. Other than some obligatory professional respect and empathy, none of the East\u2019s other playoff teams is feeling sorry for the Celtics. Irving\u2019s absence already has provided a boost to Boston\u2019s rivals and \u2013 based on Toronto\u2019s recent play and annual deference to James \u2013 probably eased the Cavaliers\u2019 road to a fourth consecutive Finals. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Now they will have to go through the playoffs without Kyrie Irving. The star point guard will need surgery on his left knee and is done for season . The team on Thursday put his recovery time at four to five months. * Aschburner:  Irving\u2019s injury alters East landscape Irving hasn\u2019t played since March 11 and says he won\u2019t dwell on what might have been. \u201cThe hardest thing to do sometimes is accept the uncontrollable things life throws at you,\u201d he wrote in an Instagram post . \u201cIt\u2019s simply a test of your perseverance and will, to be present, even in the wake of what\u2019s going on.\u201d https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BhMonavHMi0\/ In the upcoming surgery, two screws will be removed. They were implanted after Irving\u2019s patellar fracture during the 2015 NBA Finals. Irving recently developed an infection at the site of the screws, and now they must be taken out. Following his original procedure last month, the team had said the knee was structurally sound and the kneecap healed, but the wire had been putting pressure on the knee. This is Irving\u2019s first season in Boston after he demanded to be traded from Cleveland. And the player he was dealt for, Isaiah Thomas, is out for the year following hip surgery. Irving believes his best basketball is ahead of him. \u201cThis season was only a snapshot of what\u2019s to come from me,\u201d he said in his post. \u201cTrust Me. The journey back to the top of Mt. Everest continues.\u201d This latest news isn\u2019t surprising considering the tight recovery window Irving faced. But it is a blow to a Celtics team that had been playing well despite a run of recent injuries to key players. Boston will likely enter the playoffs as the No. 2 seed behind Toronto. In addition to Irving, Marcus Smart is sidelined following right thumb surgery and Daniel Theis is out for the season after left knee surgery. And Gordon Hayward is not expected back as he recovers from his gruesome ankle injury in the season opener. While Toronto will most likely enter the postseason with the East\u2019s top seed, the conference was still considered to be wide open prior to Irving\u2019s injury. With Irving out, the Celtics will now need someone to be the sparkplug for a team that had been hoping to make a run at the conference title following last year\u2019s loss to Cleveland in the conference finals. Boston certainly takes a hit without Irving, but it has been making adjustments to its rotation for weeks. Irving has been out for the last 11 games, with Boston going 7-4 without him. The hole his absence created has been filled nicely by reserve Terry Rozier, who is playing his best basketball in his third year in the league. He has appeared in 77 of 78 games, starting 13. He\u2019s made the most of his extra floor time, averaging 11.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists \u2013 all career highs. Others have stepped up as well. Offseason pickup Marcus Morris averaged nearly 20 points a game last month and was key in Boston\u2019s recent six-game win streak. Rookie Jayson Tatum has also hit a midseason stride, scoring in double figures in eight straight games before that streak ended in Wednesday\u2019s loss at Toronto. Veteran Al Horford and second-year forward Jaylen Brown have also had their moments over the second half of the season.

After an 0-2 trip through Los Angeles, though, the Spurs\u2019 opportunity to seal up a spot just got tougher. Losses to the Los Angeles Lakers last night and playoff-chasing LA Clippers on Tuesday have the Spurs at No. 5 in the Western Conference. They are tied with the No. 6-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder and a half-game behind the No. 4-seeded Utah Jazz (who own the tie-breaker with the Spurs). After falling to the lottery-bound Lakers last night, the Spurs\u2019 veterans know they are running out of time to get their playoff place in order. Tom Orsborn of the San Antonio Express-News has more from LaMarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol and Dejounte Murray on the loss last night : San Antonio has three games left in its season. On Saturday, the Spurs host the No. 3-seeded Portland Trail Blazers ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ) and on Monday they host the lottery-bound Sacramento Kings ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Their season finale is a Wednesday road game against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). The Pelicans \u2014 as well as the Denver Nuggets and LA Clippers \u2014 are currently fighting to nab the West\u2019s No. 8 spot. The Spurs were out of the playoff chase and No. 10 in the West after losing to the Houston Rockets on March 12 . They then ran off six straight wins and went 8-4 over their last 12 games to get back into the playoff picture. In fact, just four days ago San Antonio was the No. 4 seed in the West . But those losses in L.A. \u2014 coupled with Utah\u2019s three straight wins and other moves in the standings \u2014 have pushed the Spurs further down the pecking order. (At the All-Star break, the Spurs were 35-24 and held the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference.) Already, the Spurs are assured of their first season without 50 wins since 1996-97 (which was also the last time they failed to make the playoffs). From the drama surrounding superstar forward Kawhi Leonard, to this current race for a playoff spot to some players-only meetings, this season has been like no other in recent memory for the Spurs . * * *"},{"id":46915,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-chemistry-depth-keep-win-streak-alive","date":"2018-04-05","title":"Philadelphia 76ers turn to veterans, depth to run win streak to 12 games","content":" In toppling the Detroit Pistons last night , the Philadelphia 76ers ensured the Eastern Conference playoff lineup won\u2019t be changing.

But once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in. Does it really matter which slot you\u2019re seeded into as one of the 16 playoff teams, any more than it matters which chair you\u2019ve grabbed? What we\u2019re seeing now and possibly for a good chunk of this final week before the postseason packs a ton of potential drama. Out West , there\u2019s a veritable play-in tournament going on, with two games separating the teams from seventh to 10th place (as of Wednesday morning). Extend that by one game and you\u2019re corralling three more teams, all the way up to fourth place and at least one round with homecourt advantage. In the East , there\u2019s a cluster of three teams vying for position just behind Toronto and Boston, then another three at the bottom of the bracket maneuvering to lessen their \u201cfirst-round fodder\u201d prospects. All that jockeying for position, though, might be overrated if it doesn\u2019t necessarily improve a team\u2019s chances to survive and advance. And when the standings gap between teams is so razor thin, the differences between high-, mid- and low-seeds flatten out pretty quickly. Consider, if the playoffs began today, Houston at No. 1 would be opening against a team with 43 victories, while Utah and San Antonio at Nos. 4 and 5 would be facing foes (each other) with 45. Not a lot to differentiate the formidability of those opponents based on seeding compared to, say, the injuries one team might be nursing relative to another\u2019s. Or how \u201chot\u201d someone is as opposed to, y\u2019know, \u201ccold.\u201d Will Washington, for example, be scarier than your run-of-the-mill lower seed now that point guard John Wall has returned after missing 19 games over two months with a bum left knee? Is Toronto more beatable than a traditional No. 1 seed, by virtue of its recent slump of five losses in eight games? It seems pretty clear that Utah, in winning 26 of its 31 games since late January, is a team no one else out West wants to face, regardless of where the Jazz settle in by the end of business next Wednesday. Then there is Cleveland, which has flatlined and bounced back this season more than Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees combined. Who\u2019s the favorite out East? Quite possibly the No. 3 seed, unless the Cavaliers slip to fourth or fifth. Even the most obvious benefit of finishing in the Top 4 in each conference assures a team and its fan base of nothing. John Schuhmann, NBA.com\u2019s chief numbers cruncher, dug up the unexpected quirk that in each of the past 11 postseasons (2007-2017), at least one team with the homecourt edge got eliminated in the first round. That\u2019s not supposed to happen, but it does argue a bit against busting a gut to finish fourth rather than fifth. Also, no one at this point doubts LeBron James\u2019 ability \u2013 or Golden State\u2019s, for that matter \u2013 to get to The Finals again even if it requires winning a road game or three along the way. What matters most in seeding is not the position itself but the matchup it creates. If Milwaukee or Miami believes that Boston, riddled recently by injuries, is better tackled sooner rather than later in the postseason \u2013 that underdog isn\u2019t going to fret about finishing seventh or eighth to draw the Celtics in Round 1. Especially if sixth would mean the Cavs. There are coaches on both sides of the question. Gregg Popovich or Steve Kerr seem wary of the costs of killing oneself to chase a higher seed, cognizant of the energy expended and injury risks incurred. Mike D\u2019Antoni, by contrast, spoke after a Rockets loss Sunday about the staleness that can set in and undermine a playoff team that isn\u2019t careful. \u201cBeing rested and playing bad is not going to be a good formula,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, stressing that his Houston team needs to spiff up its rhythm. \u201cThey have enough rest. How it became vogue just not to play, I don\u2019t know.\u201d As for Dwane Casey, easing off the gas when the Raptors are sputtering doesn\u2019t seem like the proper way to prep for the postseason. If anything, Toronto\u2019s five-game sprint to the finish could be its best shot at restoring the confidence and edge it had through its first 70 games. So what is the true value of a fifth seed over a seventh, a third over a sixth? A 2010 Harvard study of NBA postseasons from early in this century found no definitive outcome, beyond reminding us that teams that slot in higher typically are of greater quality over the first 82 than those who finish lower. A minor hockey league, the Southern Professional Hockey League, has imbued its top seeds with greater advantages by empowering them to draft their first-round competition. As written about in Feburary by Dieter Kurtenbach of the San Jose Mercury News , letting Houston hand-pick its opening opponent \u2014 sort of the All-Star \u201cplayground\u201d draft, writ large and more meaningful \u2013 followed by Golden State and so on could dial up not just the rewards of chasing a Top 4 slot but the intensity of a lower seed chosen as an alleged patsy. For now, though, we should enjoy the neck-and-neck finish to this regular season for what it is \u2013 survival out West, competition across both conferences \u2013 rather than what the final order suggests for the playoffs. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Clippers\u2019 guard leads his team in scoring and assists per game, as well as 3-pointers taken and made, in perhaps the best of his 13 NBA seasons. Houston\u2019s Eric Gordon , the 2017 winner, is my No. 2 for doing as much as, or more than, for the Rockets again. The third slot on my ballot goes to Denver\u2019s Will Barton over the Lakers\u2019 Kyle Kuzma if for no other reason than the Nuggets have been playing games that matter. Tas Melas : 1. Lou Williams, LA Clippers. Nearly an All-Star coming off the bench and deserves consideration for Kia Most Improved Player in year 13. 2. Eric Gordon, Houston Rockets. With all the storylines going on in Houston, Gordon has been overlooked. His numbers were better in all those games he filled in as a starter, but his ranking here shows how great he was in both roles. 3. Fred VanVleet, Toronto Raptors. He is the honorary captain of the Raptors bench mob and the likeliest of that crew to finish games. He has the poise of a veteran, not a second year guy, and he\u2019ll be making big plays for years to come. Shaun Powell : 1. Lou Williams, LA Clippers. Yes, he has started a fistful of games but for the most part has fit the definition of a sixth man and nearly made the All-Star cut while averaging roughly five points over his previous career best for a season. 2. Eric Gordon, Houston Rockets. Like Lou, Gordon was pressed into emergency starter\u2019s duty for a spell because of Houston injuries, but his long distance gunning has been a major part of Houston\u2019s climb to the top in the West. 3. Jordan Clarkson, Cleveland Cavaliers. Very under the radar player who has toggled between the Lakers and Cavs this season and shooting respectably while averaging 14 points, getting the nod just ahead of the Raps\u2019 Fred VanVleet. John Schuhmann :  1. Lou Williams, LA Clippers. With all their injuries and with a rotation-altering trade in the middle of the season, the Clippers are still in playoff contention, and Williams is the biggest reason why. He has carried what ranks as the league\u2019s eighth best offense , which has been almost nine points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor than it\u2019s been with him off the floor . 2. Eric Gordon, Houston Rockets. The Rockets have been almost as good with only one of their two stars on the floor as they\u2019ve been with both, and Gordon is a big reason why. He leads the league in raw plus-minus and he\u2019s been a more efficient scorer than he was last season . 3. Fred VanVleet, Toronto Raptors. He\u2019s the best player on the best bench in the league . He\u2019s been a solid scorer, playmaker and defender, and he leads the league in plus-minus off the bench .  Sekou Smith : The LA Clippers leading man Lou Williams is No. 1 on my list and should have his name etched permanently on the trophy, right next to Jamal Crawford\u2019s. I have the Houston Rockets\u2019 Eric Gordon at No. 2 , his work off the bench for the best team in the league being a critical component in the Rockets\u2019 rise to prominence the past two seasons. At No. 3 I have to go with the most underrated sixth man in basketball, the Denver Nuggets\u2019 Will Barton. It\u2019s tough to find any other way of highlighting what he does for the Nuggets for those who don\u2019t watch that team on a regular basis. But he\u2019s been the ideal game changer off that Denver bench and routinely makes winning plays for a team that\u2019s still alive in the playoff hunt."},{"id":41050,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-non-playoff-team-brightest-future-2018-19-nba-season","date":"2018-04-04","title":"Blogtable: Which non-playoff team has brightest future for next season?","content":" * * * Of the teams officially out of the playoff race, which one \u2014 right now \u2014 has the brightest future for 2018-19? * * * Steve Aschburner : Got to go with the Lakers , both for the talent they already have on board and the free agents they\u2019re positioned to woo this summer. Frankly, one of their biggest challenges may be sorting out what they have vs. what they want, because the core of Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball could develop nicely on its own merits. But Magic Johnson isn\u2019t going to dawdle. Tas Melas : The Lakers. Their young core of Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, and Julius Randle have been playing well beyond their years. For such a young bunch to rank 12th defensively is very impressive (as my man John Schuhmann details with some stats below). Regardless if a superstar joins them via free agency, I\u2019m most excited about the ceiling of their young players over any other lottery team because three of the guys I mentioned are rookies, and Ingram\u2019s only a second-year guy. They do not look, behave, or play that green. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019s the Lakers , and by a landslide if they enjoy the offseason of their dreams. They\u2019re just set up to rebound better than the other teams, with money to spend, a dollop of young stars on rookie contracts and a guy in the front office (Magic Johnson) who happens to be a winner in all things basketball. We all know who they\u2019re chasing, and if the Lakers do hit bull\u2019s-eye this summer in free agency and\/or through trades, they\u2019ll be a title contender. John Schuhmann :  The Lakers. They already have four good young players on rookie contracts on their roster. Brandon Ingram showed some serious improvement with his offensive game in his second year, Kyle Kuzma is an all-around talent, and while Lonzo Ball can\u2019t shoot, he\u2019s been the rare rookie guard who makes an impact defensively. If the Lakers lose Julius Randle in free agency, it\u2019s probably because they got an upgrade. The Lakers have been the league\u2019s most improved defensive team this season ( having allowed five fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season ), and have been the league\u2019s most improved offensive teams since the All-Star break ( having scored 5.8 more points per 100 possessions than they did before the break ). They\u2019ve taken real steps forward already and have something to build on.  Sekou Smith :  The Los Angeles Lakers possess the best combination of young, developing talent and salary cap flexibility heading into what could be a wild free-agent summer. The Lakers still have to sort out some internal issues (Isaiah Thomas and his future being the most glaring) and decide which of their young core pieces are keepers (Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson, once thought to be, clearly were not). But we\u2019ve seen enough from Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball to know that the Lakers have plenty of talent to work with moving forward. If they make any sort of splash in free agency, go ahead and place the Lakers on your playoff fast track for next season. * * *"},{"id":41054,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-boston-celtics-or-toronto-raptors-no-1-seed-eastern-conference","date":"2018-04-04","title":"Blogtable: Will Boston Celtics or Toronto Raptors nab No. 1 seed in Eastern Conference?","content":" * * * With roughly one week to go in 2017-18, who gets the No. 1 seed in the East: the Toronto Raptors or Boston Celtics? Please explain your answer.  * * * Steve Aschburner : Toronto, in what comes down to a choice between the Raptors\u2019 late-season swoon (dropping five of their past eight) vs. the Celtics\u2019 injury issues. Wrapping up on the road at Detroit and at Miami is no bargain, but Toronto could have things settled by then, assuming it takes care of home court \u2014 which is what this is all about \u2014 against the Celtics Wednesday night. I\u2019d be less bullish on the Raptors, of course, if they had any more games left against LeBron and the Cavs, who appear to have set up shop again in the Toronto team\u2019s heads. Tas Melas :  Raptors. They control their own destiny (unlike Boston), they are fully healthy (unlike Boston), and I don\u2019t think they have come this far to lose the No. 1 seed (which they could capture for the first time in their history). Although Toronto has a tougher schedule the rest of the way, I don\u2019t see them losing to Boston twice in five days, and if the Raptors beat Boston tonight, they\u2019ll own the tiebreaker due to conference record Shaun Powell :  Given the injury issues and a two-game deficit as of Tuesday night, it doesn\u2019t look great for the Celtics despite their stronger than expected flourish here at the tape. So let\u2019s give it to Toronto by a whisker. The real question: In that scenario, does the Raptors\u2019 Dwane Casey, who\u2019s had no injuries, deserve Coach of the Year over Brad Stevens? John Schuhmann :  Picking Boston would mean picking Boston to win in Toronto on Wednesday. That would give them the tiebreaker and they could pick up another game after that, with one fewer game against good teams ( the Raptors play Indiana and Miami , the Celtics play Washington ) and one fewer road game remaining on the schedule. But I\u2019ll give the edge to the Raptors at home on Wednesday, with both teams playing the second game of a back-to-back and the Celtics being shorthanded. Then we wait to see who wins Cavs-Sixers in Philadelphia on Friday and which one of these teams would potentially face Cleveland in the conference semifinals.  Sekou Smith :  Toronto. And I think this is more about the Raptors holding on more than anything else. Whatever confidence they inspired earlier this season has waned a bit recently, losses to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers and to the feisty Celtics in their last six games has to sting even the most ardent of the Raptors\u2019 robust fan base. Their performance of late has certainly made me nervous for them. But a three-game home stand (tonight against Boston, Friday against Indiana and Sunday against Orlando) provides the Raptors a perfect opportunity to secure their position atop the Eastern Conference standings. Their destiny is in their own hands. All they have to do is finish. * * *"},{"id":41051,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-suffers-ankle-injury-vs-dallas-mavericks","date":"2018-04-04","title":"Damian Lillard suffers ankle injury late in loss to Dallas Mavericks","content":"Damian Lillard and the Blazers were rolling heading into last night\u2019s game against the Dallas Mavericks.

On Monday, a representative for James sent a letter on his behalf to Alabama, claiming the Crimson Tide\u2019s \u201cShop Talk\u201d trailer uses \u201cideas, concepts and format\u201d from a program on the digital media platform the Cavaliers\u2019 superstar co-founded.

Following Tuesday\u2019s win over Toronto in Cleveland, James was told about Saban\u2019s stance. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I would think he would say,\u201d James said. \u201cI built \u201cUninterrupted\u201d for a reason and for us athletes to have a platform to be able to speak about whatever we want to talk about.

The billboard went up at the intersection of NE Broadway and Martin Luther King Boulevard after Blazers fans exceeded the goal started on a Go Fund Me page by the satirical Trail Blazers social media campaign, \u2018Trillblazin.\u2019  The billboard has an all black background with bold, white text that reads, \u201cLeBron, Dame needs a third option.\u201d followed by a hashtag of #BRON2PDX2018. (The \u201cDame\u201d referred to here is, of course, Portland Trail Blazers All-Star guard Damian Lillard.) In mid-March, the minds behind \u2018Trilblazin\u2019 sought to raise $2,000 for the billboard, but thanks to donations from celebrities who hail from Portland, that number was soon surpassed. Tim Brown of The Oregonian has more on the new billboard and what may be next : Similar types of billboards have been launched by other fans, first by a remodeling company in Philadelphia (which put the billboards installed in Cleveland) and also by an attorney in Los Angeles (who had them put up in L.A.) . James can become a free agent this summer and many fan bases around the NBA are hoping their team takes a shot at signing him. The Oregonian reported in March that Trillblazin co-founders Ira Lafontaine and Keith Kunis were open the possibility of putting up transit ads in Portland or, perhaps, a sign in Cleveland near Quicken Loans Arena . Personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani put up four billboards around Los Angeles to try and woo James, who can enter free agency this summer . ESPN.com reported the Philadelphia billboards were leased by Power Home Remodeling, a company based in Chester, Pennsylvania. The company\u2019s CEO says the goal is to bring James, a three-time NBA champion, to Philadelphia because \u201cwe think the best athletes should want to play here.\u201d When the billboards in Philadelphia were erected, James couldn\u2019t help but be flattered by them. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not. Not a distraction,\u201d James told reporters on Feb. 27 . \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering \u2014 but people in their respective city want me to play for them. That\u2019s cool I think. That\u2019s dope.\u201d The 33-year-old James can opt out of his contract this summer with the Cavaliers. He\u2019s said in the past that he would like to end his career with Cleveland, but because he hasn\u2019t given the team a long-term commitment, there is constant speculation that he may leave his home state a second time. James famously announced he was taking his \u201ctalents to South Beach\u201d and signed with the Miami Heat in 2010.

I really wanted to get that game.\u201d Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra also addressed the comments by Miami\u2019s 7-foot center \u2013 and highest-paid player on the roster, saying he was disappointed Whiteside elected to publicly express his frustration. \u201cGuys want to throw a few eggs after the game or T.P. my house, that\u2019s actually a better way to deal with it than speaking to (the media) about the frustrations,\u201d Spoelstra said. Whiteside\u2019s comments after the game included questioning Spoelstra\u2019s decision to play small instead of going big. \u201cMan, it\u2019s annoying, you know. Why we matching up? We got one of the best centers in the league,\u201d Whiteside said Saturday night. \u201cWhy we matching up? A lot of teams don\u2019t have a good center.\u201d On Monday, he said he regretted his comments. \u201cI could have handled it different,\u201d Whiteside said, \u201cbut I was so caught up and wanted to get that win. I get real competitive. I really want to be out there, but I just trust coach\u2019s decision.\u201d Saturday\u2019s game was the second for Whiteside in his return to the court after missing the previous nine games with a hip injury. He said he was pleased with how he felt after Monday\u2019s practice. \u201cI feel great,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cWe had a great practice. I\u2019ll leave it up to the coaching staff\u2019s hands.\u201d Spoelstra called Whiteside\u2019s comments \u201cpoor timing\u201d and \u201cpoor judgement.\u201d The coach said he has spoken to Whiteside since Saturday\u2019s game, but insists his role is not in question despite Whiteside playing about seven minutes less than he did a year ago. He has been on the bench for a number of fourth quarters throughout the season. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the role,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe knows exactly what\u2019s expected of him as he continues to get back in shape. He knows what I want out of him and what his teammates want out of him. He\u2019ll continue to work to get back in shape and we\u2019ll get him back to where he was before he got hurt about three-and-a-half weeks ago.\u201d Amid the Whiteside drama, there is something to perhaps celebrate on Tuesday night \u2013 the Heat can clinch their 20th playoff spot in 30 seasons with a win over Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re just motivated for the playoffs,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep pushing. I had high expectations for this team. Earlier in the year I said this could be a 50-win team. Unfortunately I battled injuries this year, but we still got a chance to be in the playoffs.\u201d Whiteside is one of 14 players averaging a double-double this season. He\u2019s the second Heat player to average a double-double four consecutive seasons, joining Rony Seikaly. When Whiteside plays this season, the Heat are 27-22; when he doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re 14-14. Those are the positive numbers. There also are some puzzling ones. Whiteside blocked an NBA-best 3.7 shots per game two seasons ago; he\u2019s averaging 1.7 a contest this season. His field-goal percentage will drop for the third consecutive year, and is below 50 percent when taking away his 84 dunks. He\u2019s struggled to finish at the rim in some games, and has appeared to not have the same lift as he did in his first three Heat seasons. Whiteside also has had three stints out of the lineup because of injuries this season, missing about nine weeks with two bone bruises in his left knee and pain in his left hip. If healthy, on the floor and in form, Whiteside will play a significant role for the Heat in a playoff run. \u201cHe can help us a lot,\u201d Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. \u201cObviously he\u2019s got to continue to get in game shape like all of us that come back from injuries because you\u2019ve got to get confident in your body so that takes a little while, but when he\u2019s into it, he\u2019s one of the most dominant centers in the game.\u201d"},{"id":41093,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2017-18-week-25","date":"2018-04-02","title":"Week 25 Power Rankings: Boston Celtics make things interesting atop Eastern Conference","content":" We\u2019re almost there.

The NBA and KultureCity have teamed up to make the NBA Store more accommodating and accessible to guests with sensory sensitivities. The store will offer bags with noise-cancelling headphones, fidget spinners, weighted lap bands and more to families and individuals who may need them. In addition, all NBA Store employees have gone through in-person and online certified training, led by KultureCity, to learn how to better interact, communicate and help those guests that may need assistance during their shopping experience. \u201cThis is a 24\/7\/365 initiative of the store,\u201d said Todd Jacobson, the NBA\u2019s Senior VP of Social Responsibility. \u201cRegardless of when you go into the store, at any time during the year, you can feel comfortable that the experience will be a positive one. If something arises, the staff is trained to provide support, they understand it, and they have a plan in place to make sure that they can help in any way there is possible.\u201d Sensory sensitivities or challenges with sensory regulation are often experienced by individuals with autism, dementia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other similar conditions. One of the major barriers for these individuals is sensitivity to noise and over stimulation, which is a part of the environment at a large retail space. With its new certification, the NBA Store is now better prepared to assist guests with these challenges to have the most comfortable experience possible when visiting. The launch of the sensory-inclusive NBA Store is the latest in the league\u2019s partnership with KultureCity \u2014 a non-profit organization dedicated to rethinking accessibility to create acceptance and inclusion for all individuals. The NBA and KultureCity first partnered in 2017 to reconsider accessibility in NBA arenas and promote a positive and accommodating experience for fans and guests with sensory needs. The NBA in-game presentation can be a sensory overload with loud music, bright flashing lights, screaming fans and occasional pyrotechnics. While that is part of the show and part of the enjoyment for many fans, it could potentially be overwhelming for children and adults with sensory sensitivities. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant challenge and I think that\u2019s why a lot of these families, and also individuals, decide not to partake in the NBA experience,\u201d said Dr. Julian Maha, the founder of KultureCity. \u201cI think that\u2019s the sadness of the whole thing. Because we are one of those families; I have a non-speaking son who is on the autism spectrum, and he loves basketball and because of all of this it was very tough to take him to a game. And that\u2019s why a lot of our families end up withdrawing from the community and isolating ourselves.\u201d It was Maha\u2019s experience with his son that led him to found KultureCity and it was a relationship he built with the Cleveland Cavaliers when helping make Quicken Loans Arena the first sensory-inclusive arena in the world back in 2016 that led to the partnership between KultureCity and the NBA. \u201cThey made a really wonderful relationship there in Cleveland and from their relationship we got introduced and met with KultureCity and were just very impressed,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cWe met with them and literally after a half hour we decided that we were going to explore this with all teams.\u201d To date, 14 NBA arenas have implemented features to make their venues accessible to families with sensory needs, with that number set to climb to 18 by the start of the 2018-19 season. Four of the arenas \u2014 Cleveland , Oklahoma City , Sacramento and Utah \u2014 currently have dedicated quiet sensory rooms to further accommodate their guests. \u201cWe get on average at least two to three emails per week from families that are so appreciative that this is in existence,\u201d said Maha of KultureCity\u2019s sensory inclusion program. \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing thing. The stories are amazing: I was never able to go to an NBA game, now I was able to take my whole family and we had a family outing.\u201d Those are the type of stories that make you want to do more, which is exactly what the NBA and KultureCity did in transforming the NBA Store. \u201cWe sat down with KultureCity and started talking about why does this just have to be arenas?\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cCan we look at our entire business and see ways in which we can use this? With any large-scale events we\u2019re doing, the store, and really kind of looking at things holistically.\u201d Beyond the NYC store, the NBA celebrates Autism Awareness Week from March 30 \u2013 April 3 to raise awareness for children and families living with autism and promote equality and inclusion. For the ninth consecutive year, the NBA has partnered with Autism Speaks, the world\u2019s leading autism science and advocacy organization to build awareness. The league is celebrating the week by \u201clighting it up blue\u201d \u2013 part of Autism Speaks\u2019 campaign to increase understanding and acceptance of people with autism \u2013 illuminating the Fifth Avenue storefront. Additionally the NBA Store will sell wristbands on World Autism Awareness Day, with all proceeds going to KultureCity and their mission to cultivate inclusive environments for all, and several teams have held clinics and invited organizations that work in the space to enjoy their games as well. \u201cThe goal here is to help raise awareness and to make sure that we \u2013 as an NBA community \u2013 continue to look at every touch point we have with a fan as well as with our employees and talk through ways in which we can make our sport more inclusive,\u201d said Jacobson. On Jan. 21, Philadelphia 76ers Head Coach Brett Brown hosted the second annual 76ers Bounce Out the Stigma Autism Awareness Clinic at the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex. Coach Brown was joined by Bounce Out the Stigma Co-Founder and Director Mike Simmel, who led more than 50 children with an autism spectrum disorder in passing, shooting and dribbling drills. On March 10, the Sacramento Kings participated in a Free Movement Clinic specifically for kids on the Autism Spectrum. The clinic was supported by Junior Kings Basketball and included yoga and dance with local autism support groups. Two weeks later, the Kings hosted their Autism Awareness In-Arena Night on March 25. \u201cOur ultimate objective is to make sure that everything we\u2019re doing at the NBA is fully inclusive and accessible to all,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the values by which we live, it\u2019s one of the innovations to our business and we\u2019re going to continue to make sure that the best experience possible for every fan, every game, every day is there.\u201d \u201cOur goal is to really make the NBA the first sensory-inclusive sports league in the world,\u201d added Maha, \u201cand really create that level of inclusion where when someone sees the NBA they are identified not only as being inclusive, but accepting, accommodating and inviting.\u201d"},{"id":41070,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/charlotte-hornets-mitch-kupchak-general-manager-offer","date":"2018-04-02","title":"Reports: Mitch Kupchak offered Charlotte Hornets GM position","content":" The Charlotte Hornets have offered their open GM position to Mitch Kupchak, according to reports from Marc Stein of the New York Times and Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer . https:\/\/twitter.com\/rick_bonnell\/status\/980818812806279169 Kupchak helped construct four championship rosters as the Los Angeles Lakers GM from 2000 to 2017.

Yet even when none of those booby-traps undermines a team\u2019s NBA season, there always is another one lurking: Math.

(AP) \u2014 Golden State Warriors guard Patrick McCaw has been released from a hospital following a terrifying fall to the floor during Saturday\u2019s game at Sacramento. The team also said Sunday that preliminary tests showed McCaw has no structural damage or problems with his nervous system after the freak injury. Golden State announced that X-rays, a CT scan and an MRI \u201cwere all clear.\u201d McCaw was able to leave UC Davis Medical Center. He is scheduled to be re-examined by a specialist on Thursday and his injury \u2013 aside from anything related to the impact of the fall \u2013 will be listed as a bruised lumbar spine. \u201cJust a huge relief,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cLast night was really terrifying. All the news has been good. He\u2019s up walking. That\u2019s the only thing that matters, that Patrick\u2019s OK. \u201cScariest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced on a basketball floor for sure.

Players for both teams eventually came to the floor and huddled in prayer as McCaw was placed on a stretcher and wheeled away with his neck stabilized. The Warriors were later informed that McCaw had feeling in his legs. Still, Kerr was shaken when he and some of his assistant coaches visited McCaw in the hospital late Saturday night.

They\u2019re always set up the same way: coaches sitting in the middle of the front row, the team\u2019s shorter players sitting on either side of Erik Spoelstra and his assistants, support staff and taller players standing in the back. Some smiles might be forced. The Heat are dealing with a 7-foot problem, at the wrong time of year. Center Hassan Whiteside was fined an undisclosed amount Sunday for \u201ccomments detrimental to the team\u201d \u2013 a response to his remarks expressing frustration with his role. He went on an expletive-laden tirade after Miami\u2019s 110-109 overtime loss Saturday night to the Brooklyn Nets , when the Heat missed a chance to clinch a playoff spot, saying he should play more and might be better elsewhere. The team had no additional comment Sunday. They resume practice Monday, when Whiteside\u2019s words will be a hot topic again. \u201cMan, it\u2019s annoying, you know. Why we matching up? We got one of the best centers in the league,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cWhy we matching up? A lot of teams don\u2019t have a good center.\u201d Whiteside didn\u2019t play in the final 21 minutes on Saturday \u2013 the last four of the third quarter, then all of the fourth quarter and overtime. The Nets went small, so the Heat went small. It\u2019s not an uncommon strategy, and Whiteside is only a few days removed from a nine-game absence for what was called hip pain. Plus, he asked to be subbed out Saturday four minutes after tipoff, a sign that his conditioning isn\u2019t optimal yet. The whole night was a dichotomy, with Whiteside first asking not to play, then complaining he didn\u2019t play enough. \u201cHe had some good moments and then they went to the smaller lineup,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cTheir speed got to our size.\u201d Spoelstra said that before Whiteside\u2019s locker-room remarks. The Heat haven\u2019t commented publicly on those, and they were off on Sunday. The Nets are a matchup disaster for Miami. Brooklyn will finish well out of the playoff race, and went 3-1 against the Heat this season. The end of the game was frustrating for the Heat, who felt calls didn\u2019t go their way. And Spoelstra lamented a timeout during a wild scramble with about 5 seconds left, a whistle he got moments before James Johnson made a shot that would have put Miami ahead. Then Whiteside spoke at his locker, and a bad night got worse. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m on a minutes restriction or what,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cBut the minutes have been like that all year. It\u2019s just really frustrating and it\u2019s been frustrating.\u201d He has immense talent, which is why Miami \u2013 which took him off the NBA scrap heap and watched him become a star \u2013 gave him a four-year deal that could be worth $98 million if he doesn\u2019t opt out after next season. Whiteside led the league in blocked shots two seasons ago, then led it in rebounding last season. He\u2019s had great moments: a tip-in at the buzzer with an injured hand to beat Detroit last season, four triple-doubles, 15 consecutive double-doubles late last season when the Heat were trying to make the playoffs. He also has a befuddling side. The Heat sent him home two years ago after an ejection against San Antonio, a night when Dwyane Wade said \u201csometimes, we don\u2019t know what he is thinking.\u201d Whiteside has lauded himself for putting up good numbers in games where the Heat lose, which isn\u2019t the best look. He\u2019s had three stints out of the lineup this season for injuries, two for bone bruises in his knee and the most recent one for the hip issue. Miami preaches team over everything. Wade is Heat royalty; he\u2019s back now but doesn\u2019t start, and usually isn\u2019t even the first guy off the bench. Udonis Haslem\u2019s No. 40 will sway from the rafters one day; he hasn\u2019t had a regular playing role in three years, which frustrates him but he still shows up to work and leads behind the scenes. It\u2019s not even uncommon for a Heat player to start one game and sit out the next. It is uncommon, however, for someone to speak out like Whiteside did. He is playing seven minutes fewer per game than he did a year ago, and the Heat are quite happy with big men Bam Adebayo and Kelly Olynyk in the lineup. With playoffs looming, the Heat will want this resolved \u2013 fast. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cI don\u2019t know man, it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d He\u2019s probably not alone on that one. * * *"},{"id":41063,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gregg-popovich-san-antonio-spurs-unsure-when-kawhi-leonard-will-be-cleared-play","date":"2018-04-01","title":"Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs unsure when Kawhi Leonard will be cleared to play","content":"SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said Kawhi Leonard is continuing his injury rehabilitation in New York with his own team of doctors, but is unsure when the star forward and \u201chis group\u201d will clear him to play. \u201cI don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to feel, he and his group are going to feel like they\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Popovich said Sunday prior to a game against Houston. \u201cIf I knew, he\u2019d be here.

Leonard is still hoping to return to the Spurs during the regular season, although they only have five games remaining following Sunday\u2019s matchup. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get well,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cOf course that\u2019s the purpose (of his stay in New York), to get well, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.

Former standout playmakers Steve Nash , Jason Kidd , Grant Hill , Ray Allen and Maurice Cheeks head up the 13-member 2018 Hall of Fame class that also includes the WNBA\u2019s Tina Thompson , coach Lefty Driesell , Charlie Scott , executives Rick Welts and Rod Thorn and Dino Radja , Katie Smith and Ora Mae Washington . Nash, Kidd and Cheeks were all standout point guards during their playing days, with each ranking in the Top 15 in assists. Nash played 19 seasons \u2014 10 of those with the Phoenix Suns \u2014 earning MVP honors in 2005 and \u201906. An eight-time NBA All-Star, Nash is also a three-time All-NBA first teamer (2005-07) and lead the league in assists five times. He ranks third on the all-time assists list (10,335) and holds the NBA record for highest career free-throw percentage (90.4). Additionally, he had four 50-40-90 seasons (field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and free-throw percentage). At Santa Clara, Nash was twice named West Coast Conference Player of the Year (1995, \u201996). In 1994-95, Kidd shared Rookie of the Year honors with Hill and would go on to become a 10-time All-Star. He won a championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 and earned All-NBA first team honors five times in his career. Additionally, he was a four-time All-Defensive first teamer four times in his career and trails only John Stockton on the all-time steals list with 2,684. He is also second to Stockton on the all-time assists list (12,091). He starred at Cal, winning Pac-10 Player of the Year and All-America honors in 1994. Smooth-shooting Ray Allen is the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in 3-point shots made (2,973). A 10-time All-Star, Allen won a championship with the Celtics in 2008. He is ranked sixth on the all-time free-throw percentage list (.894). Allen played 18 seasons, including stints with the Bucks, SuperSonics, Celtics and his final two seasons with the Heat. In his last season with the Heat (2013-14), Allen nailed the clutch 3-pointer in Game 6 of the 2013 Finals against the Spurs that forced overtime.That allowed the Heat to win that game and emerge with the Heat\u2019s third championship in Game 7. The versatile Hill never played point guard, but he was one of the NBA\u2019s best playmakers in his prime nonetheless. A 19-year NBA veteran, Hill was a seven-time All-Star and co-Rookie of the Year in 1995. He made the All-NBA first team in 1997 and was a second team member four times, too. His days at Duke were a success as well, as he helped the team to two NCAA titles (\u201991, \u201992) and was the ACC Player of the Year and an All-American in \u201994. In 2005, he was named one of ESPN\u2019s 50 Top College Players of All Time. Cheeks currently serves as an assistant coach for the Oklahoma City Thunder. But in his playing days, he was a key piece in the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 title-contending teams of the early 1980s. A four-time All-Star, Cheeks was the starting point guard on the 1983 NBA championship team. He made four All-Defensive teams in his career as well. Upon his retirement in 1993, Cheeks was the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in steals (2,310) and ranked fifth all-time in assists (7,392).

(AP) \u2014 The struggling Sacramento Kings find themselves in the national spotlight and it has nothing to do with another disappointing NBA season in their sparkling new two-year-old arena. Instead of looking ahead to the draft lottery as they wind down their 12th consecutive losing season, the Kings \u2013 like many nationwide \u2013 have turned their attention to demonstrators who have joined hand-in-hand on game nights to block entrances to the building. The wave of protests stem from the March 18 fatal shooting by police of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old unarmed black man. The Kings have embraced their role in the situation and have been supportive of both the Clark family and the protesters. \u201cThis organization has really stepped to the forefront and I wanted to use my voice as much as I could to say to try to say what I believed was right and true,\u201d Kings player Garrett Temple said. \u201cThere are a lot of different perspectives and a lot of different things to take into account but it\u2019s been a pretty hectic week.\u201d The demonstrations could grow in numbers this weekend. Sacramento police shot Clark eight times \u2013 seven from behind, according to autopsy results released Friday and the Kings play host to the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. The protests have resonated around the country as large crowds have held demonstrations and marches throughout the city, at one point blocking nearby freeways and surrounding streets in their call for action. Owner Vivek Ranadive made an impassioned pledge of support for the protesters and the community at large following the first round of demonstrations on March 22 after first consulting with his players. The NBA team has partnered with Black Lives Matter Sacramento and the Build. Black. Coalition to create a multiyear partnership that supports the education of young people and to help workforce preparation and economic development efforts in the community. \u201cTo see the Kings step up as an organization and start backing other local organizations, that means a great deal,\u201d Temple said. \u201cIt shows you that what Vivek said after the game wasn\u2019t just talk, that we really want to step in and help the community with this problem.\u201d Temple, Vince Carter and former Kings player Doug Christie will also join community activists as part of an open forum at a church in south Sacramento on Friday night to discuss the situation and possible solutions. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, raising awareness,\u201d Carter said after a recent game. \u201cRegardless of this being a professional basketball game, the bigger picture and what really matters is what was going on outside and the reason they were out there.\u201d Temple has been one of the most outspoken Kings players since the protests began. \u201cWhen I was a kid being able to listen to an NBA player or see an NBA player, your eyes light up and your ears open,\u201d Temple said. \u201cWe have to use that influence that we have in a positive manner.\u201d The protests have been mostly non-violent. Beyond blocking traffic, the demonstrators have created few problems for businesses in downtown Sacramento. They\u2019ve come at a financial cost for the Kings, too. Protesters have twice blocked entrances to Golden1 Center, forcing the arena into a lockdown mode. Only 2,400 fans made it inside for the March 22 game against the Atlanta Hawks . Three days later the demonstrators stayed away as the Kings hosted the Boston Celtics but they returned on March 27 when they took on the Dallas Mavericks and forced another lockdown of the arena and prevented all but 4,000 fans from entering. For a team that has drawn an average crowd of 17,500 this season, the lost revenue from ticket sales alone is more than $1 million by conservative estimates after refunds were offered to those fans who didn\u2019t get in. That doesn\u2019t include lost income from concession stands and merchandise sales. But Ranadive, the first person of Indian descent to own an NBA franchise, said after the Hawks game, \u201cWe stand here before you, old, young, black, white, brown, and we are all united in our commitment.\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr watched Ranadive\u2019s speech on television in awe. He said, \u201cI was very proud of the way the Kings handled it and the way the NBA handled it.\u201d Other players around the league who have played in Sacramento since the protests began expressed their concerns over the situation while praising the Kings for getting involved, including Harrison Barnes and Dirk Nowitzki of the Mavericks and Terry Rozier of the Celtics. Former Kings players DeMarcus Cousins and Matt Barnes offered to pay for Clark\u2019s funeral. Barnes, a Sacramento native who spent part of last season with the Kings, was also a pallbearer at the funeral and has organized a march prior to Saturday\u2019s game against the Warriors. \u201cThe beauty of the game is that we have this platform to be able to speak about these things and to be able to speak about police brutality, citizen-police relationships, disproportionate amount of African-Americans getting killed,\u201d said Barnes, who spent his first four seasons playing in Oakland about 90 minutes south of Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we use that platform to talk about these things. \u201cOur hearts and condolences go out to the families of those of both sides that have been affected.\u201d"},{"id":41115,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/robin-lopez-chicago-fined","date":"2018-03-30","title":"Chicago Bulls' Robin Lopez fined for verbally abusing refs","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Chicago Bulls center Robin Lopez has been fined $25,000 for verbally abusing game officials and failing to leave the court in a timely manner following his ejection, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

But just for the record, it\u2019s worth mentioning on the brink of so much excitement in San Antonio this weekend that the Ramblers of Loyola University in Chicago are clear underdogs by NBA standards as well. The other three schools that have reached the biggest stage in men\u2019s collegiate basketball are widely known as powerhouses in that sport. And as one might expect with doctors from Johns Hopkins or sportscasters from Syracuse, Kansas, Michigan and Villanova boast some pretty impressive job-placement numbers. Combined, those three schools \u2014 the Jayhawks (74), Wolverines (53) and Wildcats (44), oh my! \u2014 have sent 171 players to the NBA, its precursor, the Basketball Association of America, or the upstart American Basketball Association (1967-76). Their names are among the best known and most accomplished in the game, starting with James Naismith, the man who invented it and soon thereafter became Kansas\u2019 coach and athletic director. From Wilt Chamberlain to Joel Embiid (Kansas), from Cazzie Russell to Jamal Crawford (Michigan), from Paul Arizin to Kyle Lowry (Villanova) and beyond, the alumni lists of those three school have helped write the history \u2014 pages certainly, in some cases whole chapters \u2014 of the NBA. And then there\u2019s Loyola. And its 16 players who played professionally at the sport\u2019s highest level, without having to grab their passports. It\u2019s a humble group, smaller among the schools just in Chicago than DePaul\u2019s (35) or tweedy Northwestern\u2019s (17). And fully half of the Ramblers gone pro were in and out by 1954, before George Mikan (DePaul) even retired. Among them: Wilbert Kautz , Mickey Rottner , Jack Dwan and Jerry Nagel . Ring any bells yet? The one who made the biggest mark was Jack Kerris , a 6-foot-6 power forward who logged 271 appearances from 1949 to 1953 with Tri-Cities, Fort Wayne and Baltimore. Kerris was the Ramblers\u2019 first NBA draft pick (ninth, 1949 BAA) who served in the U.S. military during World War II before averaging 7.6 points on 36.3 percent shooting. As a group, those first eight Loyola products shot just 32.5 percent back in the proverbial day. The second Loyola eight includes Jerry Harkness and Les Hunter , starters on the 1962-63 squad that won the NCAA championship; Andre Wakefield , Wayne Sappleton and Alfredrick Hughes from the program\u2019s more recent past; and Milton Doyle , a two-way player with the Brooklyn Nets this season and the only Rambler to reach the NBA in the past 30 years. Harkness and Hunter are remembered primarily for their performances as two of the four black starters used by Loyola coach George Ireland back when that was considered unacceptable. As Tom Oates of the Wisconsin State Journal wrote this week , Ireland, a native of Madison, Wis., \u201cwas ahead of his time in the widespread use of black players even though it defied the gentleman\u2019s agreement among coaches at the time: Play one black at home, two on the road, three if you\u2019re behind.\u201d Harkness, a 6-foot-2 guard, was drafted in 1963 by the Knicks in his hometown of New York. He spent his rookie season with them before becoming the first black salesman for Quaker Oats. Three years later, Harkness wrangled a tryout with the ABA\u2019s Indiana Pacers and played 81 games in two seasons before his knees gave out. He later was employed by the team, worked in sports media and became a civic leader in Indianapolis. Hunter, a 6-foot-7 center, was drafted by Detroit and traded to Baltimore for an NBA career that lasted 24 games and 114 minutes in 1964-65. But the ABA came calling and Hunter wound up averaging 12.8 points and 7.1 rebounds for the Minnesota Muskies, Miami Floridians, New York Nets, Kentucky Colonels and Memphis Tams over six seasons. He appeared in 444 games and was a two-time ABA All-Star.  By sheer statistics, Hunter had the most prolific pro career. But the biggest name to come out of Loyola remains LaRue Martin , the NBA\u2019s No. 1 draft pick in 1972. And his notoriety largely comes from what he wasn\u2019t \u2014 Martin for five decades has been known as the biggest flop in draft history, or at least was until UNLV\u2019s Anthony Bennett was selected by Cleveland in 2013. \u201cBeing called the worst draft choice and the biggest bust, I carried that on my back for a number of years,\u201d Martin said this week, too excited by the current Ramblers\u2019 trek to the Final Four to dwell on his ill-fated pro career. \u201cIt used to hurt me when I didn\u2019t get a chance to produce. But I kept my mouth shut. Why say anything negative?\u201d Martin earned his status as first player picked by averaging 18.2 points and 15.9 rebounds across three seasons for Loyola. But he struggled to help a bad Portland team (21-61), getting on the floor for just 12.9 minutes nightly for Trail Blazers\u2019 coach Jack McCloskey. It especially galled Martin when the Blazers played in his native Chicago his rookie season. He had acquired tickets for family and friends, only to have McCloskey keep him planted on the bench the whole night. \u201cI cried like a baby but I didn\u2019t let anybody see me,\u201d the 6-foot-11 Martin said in a phone interview. \u201cIt bothered me but you have to hold things within you, because you have no control. \u201cBut I\u2019m 68 years old now. And I\u2019ve got a ring \u2014 from UPS, for 30 years of service.\u201d Martin lasted four seasons in the NBA on a contract worth approximately $900,000. He went to work after that with Nike during its early growth years in Beaverton, Ore., and still was there when Michael Jordan arrived on the NBA scene. But a friend talked him into joining UPS, with the lure that Martin could transfer home to Chicago. So he switched \u2014 and started out by driving a UPS truck for the first six months. Since then, Martin has worked at almost every level in the company, from a human resources manager to his current executive role dealing with the federal government and public affairs. He was a board member for the National Basketball Retired Players Association for six years and might run again, even while working at UPS well past his expected retirement age. Martin\u2019s life after basketball is what he thinks about in relation to his alma mater now. For every Donte Ingram, the Ramblers\u2019 shooting guard with an outside shot as an NBA prospect, there are another dozen whose hoops careers will end when they leave Loyola. \u201cIt\u2019s good to push sports, but they need to push academics too,\u201d Martin said. \u201cDid you know they\u2019ve got a graduation rate for athletes as good as Harvard University? There are a lot of things people are missing, in terms of selling this school. Sports can get you through a lot of doors, but where would I be today if I didn\u2019t get my degree. I\u2019d be back in public housing.\u201d Martin lives five blocks from campus on Chicago\u2019s North Side and walks back there often. He stays in touch with old teammates such as Rich Ford and Isadore Glover, and has come to know the other alumni who have reached the NBA. He had the offer of a ticket for the Final Four games Saturday but couldn\u2019t sync up the air travel and hotel on short notice. So he might watch Saturday\u2019s game against Michigan with students at the school. \u201cWhen it comes down to group therapy or whatever you want to call it, this team has it going on,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe key is, they don\u2019t really have a so-called superstar. These young men play together. When they see the open man, he\u2019d better be ready for a pass. And when the opposing team is taking a shot, guess who\u2019s doing the blocking out. It\u2019s all Loyola \u2013 the opposing team doesn\u2019t get a second chance. \u201cI am very, very proud of my alma mater. It\u2019s something that no one expected, but every day is a new day. There\u2019s no homecourt advantage, and these young men are doing what they have to do.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Last season\u2019s number was 23,748, and No. 23,749 of this season came on Friday night. The league is more than 8 percent ahead of last year\u2019s pace, and 25,000 makes this season is very possible. So clearly, the reliance on the 3-pointer is not going to lessen anytime soon. \u201cI think it\u2019s a trend for a while \u2013 but at some point it has to peak,\u201d said Cleveland forward Kevin Love, one of the many NBA big men who has no trouble making 3s, and that\u2019s a big reason why the totals are soaring. \u201cEvery position, 1 through 5, is now shooting 3s. You see that as such a weapon. It makes the game fun, makes it interesting. There\u2019s definitely a lot of spacing out there and it\u2019s wild to see.\u201d Thing is, that peak isn\u2019t visible. Out of 30 teams, 19 are either on pace to set \u2013 or have already set \u2013 franchise records for made 3s this season, and a couple others are within reasonable striking distance. There are shooters now all over the league. Only four seasons ago, the total of NBA players who made at least 100 3s was 57. This year, that total is going to be close to doubled. Across the NBA this season, 91 percent of players have attempted at least one 3-pointer and 81 percent of players have made at least one. Rookies are making them; Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell has 172 and is closing in on the record for a first-year player, that being 185 by Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard. Also making them are 7-footers; eight guys listed at 7-0 or better will likely get to the 100 mark by the end of the season. And the league as a whole is actually getting better at them. Accuracy from 3-point range has gone up about 1.5 percent over the last three seasons, definitely one of the reasons why scoring per game is higher than it\u2019s been at any point in nearly 30 years. \u201cWe all like to get out there, shoot a lot of 3s, spread the floor and try to move the ball as much as you can,\u201d Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cEverybody is more or less the same \u2026 with the same outline. Just get it done in different ways.\u201d 3-Point Revolution The first season where the NBA combined to make 15,000 3-pointers was 2009-10, and that seems like ages ago. The 20,000 plateau was broken just two seasons ago, and barring something very unusual this season\u2019s total will top 25,000. Love knew the 3-point pace was higher than ever. But he didn\u2019t think the record would be set this early, and that the previous mark would be obliterated. \u201cWow. Wow. Wow,\u201d Love said, upon hearing the numbers. Wow is right. The single-team mark is also about to fall, and then get left in the dust for good measure. Houston, which is quite obviously flourishing in D\u2019Antoni\u2019s free-flowing system and has the league\u2019s best overall record, needs only 19 3s to set a season record and break the mark that the Rockets established \u2026 you guessed it, last season. The Rockets average 15.5 3s per game, so it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that the team record also falls on Friday. It was only two years ago that Golden State became the first team to make 1,000 3s in a season \u2013 and the Rockets are on pace to get near 1,300 this season. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say a Mike D\u2019Antoni team will be the first team that averages 50 3s in a game,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe can laugh at that now. But it will happen, and his team will probably be the first to do it. His first team that allegedly changed the game only averaged 23 3s a game, that 2004-05 Suns team. And look where they are now, basically doubling that up almost.\u201d He\u2019s exaggerating for effect, but only slightly. That team in Phoenix averaged just under 25 3-point attempts per game. This season\u2019s Rockets are averaging nearly 43, and have gotten 50 or more attempts from deep up 12 times this season. It works for them: Houston is 11-1 in those games. It\u2019s a statistically irrelevant sample size with which to draw a comparison, but the other teams to take at least 50 3s in a game this season \u2013 Brooklyn twice, Boston once \u2013 are 0-3. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ceiling,\u201d Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d Neither does anyone else."},{"id":47135,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-kyle-korver-out-kevin-love-questionable-vs-new-orleans","date":"2018-03-30","title":"Kevin Love returns to the lineup, Kyle Korver out tonight vs. New Orleans Pelicans","content":"* Tonight on ESPN:  Pelicans vs. Cavaliers (8 ET) The Cleveland Cavaliers will be without one of their top 3-point shooters again.

Gentry figures the voters have eyes, so they\u2019ve seen the same jaw-dropping things from the superstar big man that he sees every night. \u201cHe\u2019s great, man. Just an absolutely great player in every aspect,\u201d Gentry said in a hallway at the Smoothie King Center after Davis and the Pelicans came up short in a critical game against the Portland Trail Blazers . \u201cYou want to know what kind of guy he is? He\u2019s in there beating himself up saying he should have done more. What more could he have done? He got 36 and 14 with three guys handing on him all night. Come on, man, he\u2019s just a great, great player.\u201d Davis finished with 36 points, 14 rebounds, six blocks and played the final 17 minutes in pain after injuring his left ankle late in the third quarter. He took a minute to shake it off and finished the game favoring the ankle, that required treatment after the game. These are the sorts of performances he\u2019s turned in routinely this season, particularly since the Pelicans\u2019 other All-Star big man, DeMarcus Cousins, went down with a season-ending Achilles injury Jan. 26. He and Cousins were on pace to become the first pair of teammates in NBA history to each average better than 25 points and 10 rebounds. Davis is averaging 31.1 points, 12.3 rebounds and 3.6 blocks since the All-Star break, after averaging 27.4, 10.7 and 2.1 in the 51 games before the break. So the \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants he heard in those final minutes against the Trail Blazers were well warranted for a player with range and versatility as a two-way performer that might be unrivaled in the league. \u201cI can only think of a couple guys in this league who can impact a game the way he can from end to end. It\u2019s AD and \u2026 \u201d Gentry said, before a reporter blurted out the name of the other player he was thinking of, \u201cyeah, LeBron. I mean, these guys can guard from the 3-point line to the rim and can score from those same spaces on anybody. Guys like that, wth that ability and those talents, they are just very rare.\u201d James and Davis (who occupy the No. 2 and 3 spots, respectively, in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder) will square off tonight at Quicken Loans Arena ( 8 ET, ESPN ). It\u2019ll be another chance for Davis to be measured against the league\u2019s standard-bearer in regards to the MVP conversation. James has four MVPs in his war chest, and could (and probably should) have a couple more. Meanwhile, Davis is still searching for his first. At 33, James has shown a durability and staying power that Davis, 25, is also still searching for. If there is a knock on his game, it\u2019s that he\u2019s struggled with injuries, bumps and bruises to a degree that\u2019s greater than you\u2019d expect from a player as physically gifted as the 6-foot-11, 253-pound dynamo. Tuesday night\u2019s spill against the Trail Blazers marked the 11th time this season Davis has had to exit a game because of an injury. The reaction of the crowd, a collective hush as Davis writhed in pain under the basket, was followed by wild cheers when he got to his feet and limped to the bench. Davis refused to go to the locker room, choosing instead to take a moment to gather himself and return to the game, knowing the severity of his injury was overshadowed by the weight of the Pelicans\u2019 current predicament. They need every single game to reach the postseason for just the second time in his career, the same postseason he suggested the Pelicans would have dominated had Cousins not gotten injured . That\u2019s why he\u2019ll play through whatever lingering discomfort he has to against the Cavaliers tonight. The gravity of the Pelicans\u2019 situation demands that he fight through the pain, dust himself off and get back on the floor the same way he did Tuesday night. \u201cJust knowing the type of situation we\u2019re in,\u201d Davis told reporters in New Orleans Thursday, \u201cI just wanted to be on the floor. I felt I couldn\u2019t leave that game, even though it was bothering me. I just tried to tough it out and just play through it.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 24 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  30.7 points, 8.7 assists, 5.4 rebounds Harden took a rare night off Tuesday and the Rockets still rolled over the Chicago Bulls. The Rockets are good enough to go on auto-pilot the way they\u2019re playing. They\u2019ve already set the franchise record for wins in a season and secured the Western Conference\u2019s No. 1 seed \u2026 all with seven games to go in their season. Harden\u2019s work from the start of training camp has been the catalyst for this special season for the Rockets. He worked to integrate the new additions to the lineup, but did so without sacrificing any of the things that made him the strong MVP candidate he was last season . Topping his performance from last season should be more than enough to secure his first Kia MVP. The official word will come on June 25 at the NBA Awards show . But with the way the Rockets have played down the stretch of this season with Harden leading the way, the suspense in this MVP chase has evaporated. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.6 points, 9.1 assists, 8.6 rebounds You have to appreciate LeBron\u2019s admission that he would indeed vote for himself if he had a say in the race for the Kia MVP. And it\u2019s hard to argue with his logic. Given all that the Cavaliers have endured since Kyrie Irving\u2019s trade request was made public, it\u2019s truly remarkable that he\u2019s been able to compartmentalize the way he has and continue to play at an otherworldly level. If not for James Harden, LeBron would be clearing space on his mantle for his fifth Maurice Podoloff Trophy. Instead, he\u2019ll have to settle for another season of milestones and his continued assault on nearly every career statistic the league has to offer. Not to mention he\u2019s still on track to play all 82 games for the first time in his career . And if you were wondering how the old man (relatively speaking, of course) bounces back after tough night (18 points in Tuesday\u2019s loss to Miami), catch the highlights from his 41-point, 10-rebound, eight-assist masterpiece in Charlotte on the second night of a back-to-back set. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  28.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.5 blocks Back-to-back losses at Houston and at home to Portland have put Davis and the Pelicans in a familiar position in the Western Conference playoff chase. Every game until the finish is a must-win affair, with tonight\u2019s tilt against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 8 ET, ESPN ) serving as the ideal showcase for Davis. He\u2019s been an absolute monster of late (29.6 points, 11.5 rebounds, 3.8 blocks and 2.4 assists in his last 10 games). He knows what it will take to push the Pelicans into the playoff mix without DeMarcus Cousins, as that is something Davis had to do three years ago to secure his lone playoff voyage. It took a home win over San Antonio on the final night of the regular season to clinch a spot and it might take the same this time around \u2014 Davis and the Pelicans finish up the regular season April 11 with a home game against the Spurs. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  23.3 points, 5.2 assists, 3.9 rebounds Saturday\u2019s trip game in Boston ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ) couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for DeRozan and the Raptors, who still have some work to do secure the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Their lead over the Celtics is down to three games. Given Toronto\u2019s recent losses to the Cavs and LA Clippers, a statement win on the road against the surging Celtics would go a long way towards resetting the Raptors\u2019 collective confidence. DeRozan\u2019s continued evolution as a playmaker has remained on full display (15 assists in his last two games) and will be crucial to the Raptors\u2019 offensive effectiveness in the playoffs. That\u2019s assuming coach Dwane Casey does indeed plan to keep his rotation as deep in the playoffs as he has all season. But the scoring prowess that has propelled DeRozan to All-Star status the past four seasons will be just as important, if not more so, given the relative inexperience of several of the Raptors\u2019 role players. Both DeRozan and fellow All-Star Kyle Lowry know how vital it will be for them to be in a good rhythm for the postseason. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  26.8 points, 6.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds Lillard was spectacular in a critical road win in New Orleans Tuesday night, finishing with a game-high 41 points (and nine rebounds, six assists and four steals). He did all that while out-dueling fellow MVP candidate Davis in what was a thrilling, must-see fourth quarter . It didn\u2019t matter who was guarding Lillard \u2014 sometimes it was Davis and other times it was Pelicans defensive wiz Jrue Holiday. Lillard was locked in and on absolute fire in a playoff atmosphere. His importance to the Trail Blazers, though, was even more evident a night later when he was missing from a deflating road loss to in Memphis. Lillard missed the game for a good reason: the birth of his son . But it should be clear by now that these Trail Blazers will go only as far as the mercurial Lillard can take them in the postseason. C.J. McCollum is as good a No. 2 option as you\u2019ll find and Terry Stotts has done Coach of the Year-caliber in developing the roster. It\u2019s Lillard\u2019s scoring and playmaking, however, that takes them from a solid team to a top-three seed in the Western Conference. 6. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 7. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 8. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 9. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 10. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves And five more \u2026: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs; Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers Next up? An inside look at LaMarcus Aldridge from an Western Conference advance scout: \u201cI would love to know exactly what was said in the conversation he had with [Spurs coach Gregg] Pop[ovich] after last season , from both sides. Because whatever it was, it\u2019s produced the best season I\u2019ve seen from LA since he\u2019s been in the league. And I\u2019m dating that back to his best years in Portland. The Spurs aren\u2019t close to the team they are with all of the heavy lifting he\u2019s done this season. He\u2019s been more physical and much more active on the defensive end than he was last season and obviously, with Kawhi Leonard missing from the lineup for basically the entire season, his responsibilities as the No. 1 option for them offensively has been tremendous. He\u2019s always been a skilled, face-up big. Working from the L and on the baseline extended, he\u2019s as tough a cover as you\u2019ll find at that position. \u201cHe embraced the other stuff, though, and perhaps at Pop\u2019s urging. He\u2019s made himself a more physical presence around the basket and at the rim. When he\u2019s working in space against opposing [centers], that\u2019s when he really has an advantage, because he\u2019ll abuse guys his size and bigger who aren\u2019t as mobile, guys who cannot match his quickness. He\u2019s not an above the rim guy or a rim protector that causes you any concern, but he\u2019s stronger than he looks and this season, he\u2019s mixed it up more when necessary. He\u2019s been more physical than usual. I\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a direct result of what Pop was trying to convey to him. Without Kawhi out there, someone had to play that role as their offensive catalyst and to do that LaMarcus was going to have to toughen up and show more fire than he did last season. I give him credit for stepping up to that challenge. I\u2019ll admit, I was a bit of a skeptic when he was the hot free agent name a couple summers back. It\u2019s easy to forget that. He was the player everybody wanted and the Spurs got him. And it seems like he\u2019s finally comfortable there now in the role he\u2019s playing leading that team right now. I\u2019ve gained a lot of respect for him and his game with the way he\u2019s played this season.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

During Thursday night\u2019s 116-107 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks , Kevin Durant received two consecutive technical fouls after vehemently arguing a non-call on the previous possession. The star forward felt he had been fouled on a drive to the rim. Though the Warriors came up with the offensive rebound, Durant ignored the ensuing play in order to confront official Tre Maddox. He whistled Durant for a technical foul, then gave him another and tossed him with 2.4 seconds left in the first half. After the game, Durant explained why he got tossed. \u201dI got fouled, I told him how I felt about it, he kicked me out. That simple,\u201d Durant said.

The man put down his fork, thought for a moment, shrugged and offered: \u201cGiannis?\u201d Giannis, as in Antetokounmpo. As in Milwaukee\u2019s best player, which typically is a good place to start in crafting an identity but hardly sufficient for teams hoping to reach goals beyond the regular season. The Bucks\u2019 identity when training camp opened in September was Giannis. Their collective ID last spring in the first-round elimination against Toronto was Giannis. Last season, a 42-40 effort in which Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton handed off a nasty injury baton? Giannis, too. Antetokounmpo remains a tremendous player and a delight to watch as he becomes a perennial MVP candidate. He is the sort of player franchises imagine building multiple title runs around. But \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d will max out at one-and-done as far as playoff rounds go if he isn\u2019t supported by the other players on the roster or strategies that don\u2019t produce a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The Bucks are about four years into their \u201cOwn The Future\u201d marketing campaign, which is starting to feel more like they\u2019re \u201cStuck In The Past (Or At Least The Present).\u201d This season has been marked by a lack of traction and a dreary been-here, done-this feel. A year ago today, Milwaukee was 38-36 and would end up ranking fourth in field goal percentage , seventh in effective FG percentage and 26th in pace in 2016-17 . They also ranked 22nd in 3-pointers made , 24th in attempts and 10th in accuracy from out there. Defensively, they ranked 20th in effective FG percentage and 26th in defensive rebounding percentage . And this season? Strictly treadmill. The Bucks are 39-35 and are getting outscored by 0.3 points per game ( vs. 0.4 ppg last season ). They rank third in FG percentage , are tied for sixth in eFG percentage and 22nd in pace . Their 3-point game has gotten worse, relative to the league: 25th in makes , 24th in attempts , 19th in accuracy . In those same defensive categories, eFG percentage and rebounding percentage, Milwaukee ranks 20th and 28th . Antetokounmpo was Milwaukee\u2019s lone All-Star this season, just as he was in 2016-17. And the Bucks appear destined to draw the top-seeded Raptors in the first round again, this time as the No. 8 seed. There\u2019s a new arena being completed just to the north of the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Unless things change by its grand opening in the fall, though, it will feel like a fancy new theater screening a movie everyone\u2019s already seen. This began as a season in which the Bucks were expected to take a sizable step, most often defined as winning 50 games or so, securing one of the East\u2019s top four seeds and advancing to the East semifinals. Ideally, one of Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates \u2013 Middleton or guard Eric Bledsoe \u2013 would have gotten serious All-Star consideration, too. And, the team\u2019s identity would have revealed itself through its defense or the offensive variations that Antetokounmpo makes possible. Anything more and Milwaukee would have had a contender on its hands when the new building opened for 2018-19. Anything less, though, and it is stuck with its version of \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d Injuries undeniably have played a role as the Bucks have spun their wheels. Parker missed the first 50 games rehabbing from his second ACL surgery and remains an enigma. His restricted free-agent status this summer a vexing question \u2013 should they or shouldn\u2019t they? \u2013 for management. Guard Malcolm Brogdon, the reigning Kia Rookie of the Year, has been out since Feb. 1 with a left quadricieps injury. Milwaukee misses his organizational skills in running their attack and it misses his 3-point proficiency. Reserve Matthew Dellavedova has been out since Feb. 4 with an ankle sprain after a 15-game absence in November and December. The Bucks miss 3-point bonuses, his defensive feistiness and his energy. Both he and Brogdon are expected back before this regular season ends. But the reasons for slippage this season hardly end there. Thon Maker, a 7-foot-1 project as a rookie last season, has not progressed. He\u2019s playing twice as many minutes but producing less, his shooting, assists and net rating all backsliding. Bledsoe, acquired in the early-season trade of Greg Monroe, has 22 games in which he has scored 20 points or more. But he hasn\u2019t pushed the pace for Milwaukee and, in the opinion of the aforementioned scout, \u201cdoes a lot of walking and standing around for a guard,\u201d spells that undercut some of Bledsoe\u2019s bursts for steals and 50-50 balls. Tony Snell got paid last summer on a four-year, $46 million deal largely for his 40 percent 3-point shooting in 2016-17 and he\u2019s shooting a little better from that range this season \u2014 but he\u2019s averaging one fewer attempt, rather than adding to his output. The Bucks\u2019 offensive dissatisfaction has shown more recently in interim coach Joe Prunty\u2019s use of 40-year-old Jason Terry for firepower and energy, and the recent acquisitions of Brandon Jennings and Shabazz Muhammad. Meanwhile, what once was Milwaukee\u2019s defensive identity \u2014 long, interchangeable defenders with improbable wingspans \u2014 first got solved by opposing coaches and now is essentially gone. That leaves Antetokounmpo, who has the burden of carrying these guys however far they\u2019ll go this spring. There\u2019s a difference of 12.1 points in the Bucks when their best player is on the floor vs. off the floor \u2014 plus-4.1 in net rating when he plays, minus-8.0 when he sits \u2014 with the fatigue of a long season likely to add to the defensive attention he\u2019ll receive from repeated postseason game-planning. The prospects of Prunty being asked back look slim, barring a second-round surprise (or beyond). And the shade his predecessor, Jason Kidd , threw on the team shortly before he was fired \u2014 that people expecting a high seed and advancement in the playoffs were getting ahead of themselves \u2014 is starting to look like insight. Disappointingly so. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Kemba Walker is in that conversation regarding Charlotte Hornets history. And Karl Anthony-Towns has a ways to go to reach that status in Minnesota Timbewolves lore. On Wednesday night, though, all three players added to their respective legacies with milestone games. James joined rarefied air with his 41-point, 10-rebound, eight-assist effort in a 118-105 win against the Charlotte Hornets . His empahtic dunk off a lob from JR Smith in the second quarter put him in double-figure scoring, marking the 866th consecutive game James has performed that feat . The only other player to log that many double-figure scoring games is Hall of Famer and Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan . Jordan\u2019s streak lasted from March 25, 1986 through Dec. 26, 2001, while playing for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. * * * Player | Games | Span Michael Jordan | 866 | March 1986 to Dec. 2001 LeBron James | 866 | Jan. 2007 to present Kareem Abdul-Jabbar | 787 | Dec. 1977 to Dec. 1987 Karl Malone | 575 | Dec. 1991 to March 1999 Kevin Durant | 562 | March 2009 to Feb. 2017 * * * \u201cI\u2019ve stayed available, obviously,\u201d James told reporters when asked how the streak was possible. \u201cI haven\u2019t played every game, but for the most part I\u2019ve played over 70 percent of my games throughout that journey, and just going out and just trying to be productive.\u201d Aside from tying Jordan\u2019s mark in the game, James also added to his place in NBA lore in another department. His fourth-quarter steal of Frank Kaminsky\u2019s pass gave him 1,859 steals in his career, moving James past Kevin Garnett for 17th on that all-time list . James can break Jordan\u2019s record Friday night when the Cavaliers host the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, ESPN ). * * * The book on Kemba Walker as he entered the 2011 NBA Draft was that of a quick, scoring guard who could excel in a fast-paced system . The No. 9 overall pick of the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) that year, Walker has gone from merely trying to hone his game to a two-time All-Star and go-to guy. Although his Hornets are more or less out of the playoff chase, Walker remains a relentless force. And while James was busy making history early in last night\u2019s game, Walker wasn\u2019t about to be outdone on his home court. He nailed a reverse layup with 20 seconds left to surpass Dell Curry as the Hornets\u2019 all-time leading scorer . Not only is he the team\u2019s leading scorer, but he ranks in the Top 10 in several other categories including games played (517), assists (2800), steal (695), field goals made (3411) and attempted (8222). Walker also leads the Hornets in 3-pointers made (1016), 3-pointers attempted (2828) and free throws made (2003) while ranking second in free throw attempts (2405). After nabbing the Hornets\u2019 all-time scoring mark, an emotional Walker addressed the crowd and talked about his accomplishment . Moments later Walker was being interviewed on the court and broke down, grabbing a towel to wipe away the growing tears streaming down his face. \u201cIt\u2019s super special because of all of the doubt I\u2019ve gotten throughout my career and all of the criticism, but I just continue to prove them wrong,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt was just pretty emotional. I really wish I would have played better earlier and we would have had a more competitive game but it\u2019s still a huge accomplishment. For my family to be here and all the fans cheering me on like that, especially because we lost, they made it pretty special anyway.\u201d Hornets owner Michael Jordan wasn\u2019t at the game, but weighed in with a statement released through the team. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for Kemba,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cBecoming a franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer is a big accomplishment and it\u2019s a testament to his hard work, dedication and passion for the game of basketball. He exemplifies what it means to be a Hornet. His effort, leadership and commitment to our team and the City of Charlotte is second to none. I\u2019m proud to have him on our team.\u201d * * * As for Towns, he did something Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Stephon Marbury or any other Wolves great had done before. The All-Star big man terrorized the Atlanta Hawks in a 126-114 win , dropping a team-record 56 points. Towns shot 19 of 32 from the field and 12 of 15 from the free throw line, dropping in 30 points and 11 rebounds in the second half. He set the mark with a corner 3-pointer with 1 minute, 16 seconds left in the game . That gave him 54 points, breaking the single-game mark of 52 set by Mo Williams on Jan. 13, 2015. Towns later added a pair of free throws in the game\u2019s waning moments to reach the 56-point mark. Per Elias Sports, over the last 30 years only five players have logged 55-plus points and 15-plus rebounds in a game. Towns became the newest member of that club last night. * * * Player | Date | Team | Opponent | Points | Rebounds Karl-Anthony Towns | March 28, 2018 | Wolves | Hawks | 56 | 15 | Watch Anthony Davis | Feb. 21, 2016 | Pelicans | Pistons | 59 | 20 | Watch Shaquille O\u2019Neal | March 6, 2000 | Lakers | Clippers | 61 | 23 | Watch Michael Jordan | March 28, 1990 | Bulls | Cavs | 69 | 18 | Watch Karl Malone | Jan. 27, 1990 | Jazz | Bucks | 61 | 18 | Watch * * * Additionally, per Elias, Towns became the second-youngest player with at least 55 points and 15 rebounds in a game.

Barry had 57 points and 15 rebounds in a Dec. 14 San Francisco Warriors win against the New York Knicks. For the record, only four Timberwolves have ever scored 50-plus points in a game : Love ( 50 points vs. OKC on March 23, 2012 ), Corey Brewer ( 51 points on April 11, 2014 ), Williams and now, Towns. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":41134,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-runs-double-digit-streak-866-tying-michael-jordans-record","date":"2018-03-29","title":"LeBron James runs double-digit streak to 866 games, tying Michael Jordan's all-time record","content":"With an empahtic dunk off a lob from JR Smith in the second quarter of Wednesday\u2019s game , LeBron James reached double figures in his 866th consecutive game, equaling Michael Jordan\u2019s all-time record.

The team that perfected (if not created) the art of resting players \u2014 especially their geezers \u2014 are pressing. It\u2019s all hands-on deck, and all tongues on the floor, as we saw the other day when Manu Ginobili had one question once he left an intense overtime win over the Utah Jazz: \u201cHow many minutes did I just play?\u201d The reply was 13 of a possible 17 in the fourth quarter and OT . \u201cOh.\u201d (face rub). This isn\u2019t a humane way to treat a 40-year-old this deep in the season, burning his limbs and leaning on him for late buckets and plays, except these aren\u2019t typical times for the Spurs. They\u2019re 43-32, haven\u2019t clinched a playoff spot yet and their streak of 20 straight postseason appearances is technically still at risk. A 50-win season \u2014 something they\u2019ve done every season but the 50-game 1998-99 campaign \u2014 depends on them winning out to end 2017-18. And of course, there\u2019s the continued and confounding absence of Kawhi Leonard, their quiet and strangely gimpy franchise player, who may not suit up again this season or perhaps ever again for the Spurs. It\u2019s all so very un-Spurs-like, so unusual for the NBA\u2019s most respected franchise (and one of the most respected in professional team sports) to be dealing with drama, mystery, turbulence and a high potential of a quick exit in the playoffs. The Spurs themselves are among those caught by surprise, as they aren\u2019t used to feeling an undercurrent of disharmony while the New Orleans Pelicans, Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors enjoy the view from the Spurs\u2019 usual perch in the Western Conference penthouse. Asked if this is the strangest Spurs season he\u2019s even been involved in, Tony Parker is quick and noticeably firm with his answer: \u201cYes. By far.\u201d The Spurs have won four of their five NBA titles during Parker\u2019s 16-year career and are respected by many, copied by none and built by Timmy [Duncan], David [Robinson] and coach Gregg Popovich. The Spurs have lived in a bubble of their own creation, insulating them from the typical stuff that challenge and sometimes break other teams. But here they are, desperate almost, lumped with the pack that has chased them for miles. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual situation,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember being in anything like this in 15 years. Unexpected, to tell you the truth.\u201d One of the original layers of the foundation is Sean Elliott, a former Spurs All-Star turned Spurs TV broadcaster and analyst, who can\u2019t believe his eyes somedays. Like others, Elliott admits to being spoiled by all the winning, stability, excellence and overall lack of alarm. But, he also knows nothing lasts forever in the NBA. \u201cI do a lot of speaking engagements around town,\u201d Elliott said, \u201cand for years I\u2019ve been telling people: \u2018You guys just don\u2019t realize that the real NBA is not here in San Antonio.\u2019 I said, \u2018One day the real NBA is going to come here.\u2019 \u201d Has real life finally caught up with the Spurs? More cold evidence is needed before reaching that conclusion, and this could very well be a momentary burp. Overall, it\u2019s hard to bet against San Antonio\u2019s track record. Yet the Spurs aren\u2019t trending in the right direction, thanks in large part to Leonard\u2019s nagging quad injury (which has limited him to nine games this season).  Parker had the same injury last May only to return this season. When he remarked the other day how his was \u201ca hundred times worse,\u201d it was a backhanded swipe at Leonard\u2019s absence, whether intended or not. The Spurs don\u2019t have a history of questioning each other in public, but this isn\u2019t a typical atmosphere for them. In all, it revealed how intense the situation with Leonard is now. Leonard hasn\u2019t responded to Parker\u2019s comments, which isn\u2019t a surprise given Leonard\u2019s usual reluctance to talk. But ex-Spurs player Stephen Jackson took offense, and hinted in an interview with Fox Sports Radio that Parker was doing Popovich\u2019s dirty work. \u201cIt\u2019s so low and the timing was even worse,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWith this comment, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this makes Kawhi want to leave. His heart and passion should never be questioned. That was low, coming from one of your teammates.\u201d In late March, the Spurs held a team meeting in which Ginobili and Parker approached Leonard with blunt questions about his status this season . Their line of questioning wasn\u2019t intense, said Danny Green, but clearly, they needed an answer. Leonard wasn\u2019t prepared to give them one. That\u2019s why Ginobili said soon after the meeting that the Spurs \u201cgotta think they he\u2019s not coming back, because it\u2019s not helping \u2026 we are who we are and we gotta fight without him.\u201d What exactly is the hold up with Leonard, who at 26 is the most important player on the club, by far? After returning to work out with the Spurs in early March , after seeking a second opinion on his injury , he hasn\u2019t played since. Suddenly, there\u2019s real concern about his future in San Antonio. There\u2019s the belief held by some within and outside the organization that Leonard is listening more to his inner circle of family and advisers. Indeed, these are heightened times for the two-time All-NBA first teamer , Kia MVP candidate and 2014 Finals MVP . He\u2019s eligible for a super max contract extension this summer and next season will be the last of his present contract. Robinson and especially Duncan took less than their market value to ensure the Spurs could spend on help. Is this the first time that their franchise player won\u2019t be as forgiving? Is Leonard willing to spend most if not all of his career in San Antonio, or is he seeking an exit strategy? Is he looking to boomerang back home to Los Angeles, where the Lakers are looking to buy A-list talent? \u201cOur superstars have always stayed here,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never wanted to wander and go someplace else. The community and organization has always made them feel appreciated. We\u2019ve never had guys jump ship on us. It still hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cTim and Dave set the standards. They were the pillars. They didn\u2019t read the superstar\u2019s handbook. They were down-to-earth, unselfish players. The organization and the team came first before the money. That\u2019s not very typical. Maybe we\u2019re running into that, maybe not. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t say until we see how the whole thing unfolds.\u201d When it comes to Leonard and his future preferences, your guess is as good as Elliott\u2019s. \u201cI know he\u2019s a very reserved guy,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cHe\u2019s starting to come out of his shell. But other than that I don\u2019t know if anybody has gotten into that inner circle with him. I think Pop has a little bit, maybe Manu and Tony, but I don\u2019t know if anyone has cracked the inner, inner circle with Kawhi.\u201d It\u2019s not all about Leonard and his injury. The Spurs also find themselves in this position because they haven\u2019t surrounded him with the level of talent Robinson and Duncan enjoyed. Beyond All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge, where\u2019s the other star or engaging young talent with the star potential? (And Aldridge hasn\u2019t always meshed well with Leonard to begin with.) This is the unexplained and under-reported issue. The Spurs play decently at times because of Aldridge\u2019s skill, their overall passing and toughness \u2013 but not because they\u2019re loaded, roster-wise. The talent-acquisition machine Popovich and GM RC Burford made set a standard for years.  Since taking Duncan No. 1 overall in 1998, the Spurs have picked in the top 20 once since then ( in 2010 ). Through shrewd use of their low first-round picks and savvy player movement, the Spurs always found the right player for their needs (Bruce Bowen, Steve Kerr, Patty Mills, etc.). They got Leonard through a 2011 Draft-day deal centered on George Hill and, in short, their player-development system was the envy of other teams. Lately, only two of San Antonio\u2019s recent Draft picks \u2014 Dejounte Murray ( No. 29 in 2016 ) and Kyle Anderson ( No. 30, 2012 ) \u2014 are getting major minutes. Neither of them are showing the future Hall of Fame stock Parker and Ginobili did in their younger days \u2013 and those two Spurs legends were also non-lottery picks . The Spurs also surprised some around the league last summer when they extended 37-year-old Pau Gasol\u2019s contract while refusing to re-sign forward Jonathon Simmons, who got his payday with the Orlando Magic . The Spurs with a healthy Leonard would make for an intriguing playoff team. Yet is it fair to say that, even with Leonard, the Spurs\u2019 title hopes would be a stretch given the 60-win Rockets and defending-champion Warriors? A best-case scenario has the Spurs winning in the first round and then facing serious summer questions about Leonard. Popovich said Leonard wants to play right now and, to his knowledge, is doing everything possible to prepare himself. \u201cIf he got added to the team for the playoffs, well, that\u2019s great,\u201d Popovich said, \u201cbut we have to act like it\u2019s not going to happen because he\u2019s not with us so this team got to have its own identity. That seems pretty logical, the only way to look at this. \u201cI think they\u2019ve done a hell of a job this year without him.\u201d Two weeks ago, the Spurs were outside the playoff picture. They then ran off six straight wins behind Aldridge, whose 32.2 ppg during that stretch was second only to LeBron James . But now Aldridge is dealing with a knee injury . Until then, said Ginobili: \u201cWe were a little down, a little demoralized.\u201d Those words aren\u2019t commonly used when describing the Spurs. Players-only meetings. Playoff bubbles. Superstar dilemmas. It\u2019s all new to a franchise that set the bar high for everyone, only to see itself struggling to clear it right now. The only thing more perplexing than the future, especially if Kawhi asks for a trade this summer or plays out his contract and moves on, is the present. \u201cThis is rare for me,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed. This time of year we\u2019re resting guys. It\u2019s hard to be successful for 20 years. Hopefully we\u2019re not the team to let that go.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

It\u2019s just what he does. When folks questioned whether the 6-foot-1 Walker was too small to become an elite NBA point guard after Charlotte selected him with the ninth pick in the 2011 NBA draft, he pushed himself to beat out D.J. Augustin as the starter. When doubters questioned the Hornets giving him a four-year, $48 million contract in 2015, all he did was become a two-time All-Star. On Wednesday night, he took another step in his impressive, if not unlikely career, passing Dell Curry to become the franchise\u2019s career scoring leader with 9,841 points. * NBA.com\/Stats:  Hornets\u2019 all-time scoring leaders \u201cIt\u2019s super special because of all of the doubt I\u2019ve gotten throughout my career and all of the criticism, but I just continue to prove them wrong,\u201d Walker said. The emotions boiled over for Walker after he made a reverse layup with 20 seconds left in a 118-105 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers to break the record Curry held for 26 years. LeBron James was having one of those nights, scoring 41 points \u2014 so the outcome was already decided. But few in the packed house had left the Spectrum Center because they wanted to see Walker \u2014 by far the city\u2019s most popular NBA player of the past decade \u2014 break the record. Once again, Walker did not disappoint, overcoming a sluggish three quarters to come alive late and finish with 21 points. Walker said he wanted to break the mark at home, rather than on the road at Washington this weekend. Curry, a broadcaster for the Hornets and a huge Walker fan, looked down from his seat well above the court with a big, proud smile on his face. James walked over to Walker as time expired and gave him a huge hug, whispering in his ear what an amazing accomplishment he had achieved. Moments later Walker was being interviewed on the court and broke down, grabbing a towel to wipe away the growing tears streaming down his face. \u201cIt was just pretty emotional,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI really wish I would have played better earlier and we would have had a more competitive game but it\u2019s still a huge accomplishment. For my family to be here and all the fans cheering me on like that, especially because we lost, they made it pretty special anyway.\u201d James said Walker has a ton of respect around the league, although his Charlotte teams have struggled to consistently make the NBA playoffs and will likely miss out again this year. \u201cListen, if you can be the all-time leading scorer in any franchise, that\u2019s incredible,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible feat. I definitely went over and just told him how incredible that was. Even though with the season that they\u2019re having, when accomplishments happen throughout the season, you try not to take them for granted. I think it\u2019s an incredible feat for him.\u201d Hornets owner Michael Jordan wasn\u2019t at the game, but weighed in with a statement released through the team. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for Kemba,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cBecoming a franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer is a big accomplishment and it\u2019s a testament to his hard work, dedication and passion for the game of basketball. He exemplifies what it means to be a Hornet. His effort, leadership and commitment to our team and the City of Charlotte is second to none. I\u2019m proud to have him on our team.\u201d For Walker, this was about the gratification of overcoming doubters. \u201cI proved them wrong again,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m about. I\u2019m about working, getting better and proving people wrong. Like I said, I\u2019m not supposed to be here. This is an unbelievable accomplishment and I\u2019m so excited that I was able to do it tonight at home.\u201d Teammate Marvin Williams said Walker plays harder than anyone he\u2019s seen in a Hornets uniform. Few would disagree. The 27-year-old Walker said that is because he\u2019s never forgotten where he came from and what he went through to get to became a national champion at UConn and to get to where he is now. \u201cI\u2019m from a rough place, the Bronx,\u201d Walker said. \u201cNot a lot of people make it this far, especially as a professional athlete. I definitely know a lot of guys that played in the league that came from the Bronx but not a lot of them are a franchise all-time leading scorer. It\u2019s special and I take pride in that. I put on every single day and night for my city. My city loves me to death. I love where I\u2019m from because if it wasn\u2019t for where I\u2019m from, I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today.\u201d"},{"id":47109,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sixers-joel-embiid-hurt-accidental-head-butt","date":"2018-03-29","title":"Report: Joel Embiid will not travel with Philadelphia 76ers on road trip after head injury","content":" Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid will not travel with the team on their upcoming two-game road trip, according to a report from Keith Popmey of the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The Lakers announced that he will be out for the rest of the season and his recovery time is four months. Thomas has played in just 17 games with the Lakers this season after initially suffering the injury with the Boston Celtics last spring . Thomas reportedly left the Lakers earlier this week to travel across the country and get a second opinion on his hip injury . According to Lakers beat reporter Mike Trudell and Tania Ganguli of The Los Angeles Times , the two-time All-Star guard went to New York in hopes of finding a solution for the injury that has compromised his ability to play since last year\u2019s postseason. Thomas has only shown flashes of the player that rocketed to stardom with the Celtics. Overall, he is shooting a career-worst 38.3 percent from the field while committing a career-high 3.2 turnovers per game . The Cavaliers, who dealt Kyrie Irving in exchange for Thomas during the offseason, quickly moved on from the 5-foot-9 point guard. Cleveland dealt him to Los Angeles at the trade deadline , where he hoped to re-establish at least some of his value before hitting unrestricted free agency this summer. According to Wojnarowski, if the Lakers miss out on landing free agents like LeBron James and Paul George, it may make the chances Thomas returns to the Lakers more likely : In an interview with the Los Angeles Times last week, Thomas told Ganguli that he was open to staying in L.A. \u2014 even in a reserve role . Those words came less than a week after Thomas told USA Today \u2018s Sam Amick that \u201cI\u2019m not no sixth man. And I won\u2019t be a sixth man (in the future). I just want everybody to know that, like clear as can be \u2026\u201d Additionally, Thomas told NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell in a late February he wants a long-term deal in free agency . \u201cI\u2019m looking to sign a long-term deal this summer but anything can happen. I can\u2019t control it and can\u2019t worry too much about it. I was only in Sacramento for three years, Boston for almost three years and the other stops were temporary.

Donovan Mitchell  2. Ben Simmons  3. Jayson Tatum Steve Aschburner : Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum, in that order as of this date. The Boston Celtics\u2019 Tatum gets the edge over the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Kyle Kuzma because of the way he stepped into a vital role for an Eastern Conference contender and for the way he\u2019s roared back in March (16.2 ppg, 6.1 rpg) from a February sag (11.9, 2.7). Mitchell is the best \u201cpure\u201d rookie in my opinion, and the most dynamic and important offensive player on the playoff-bound Utah Jazz. But Simmons has been 1A to the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Joel Embiid, and they have the Sixers headed toward homecourt advantage in the first round. His across-the-board stats are elite for a rookie and he has lived up to or exceeded some awfully lofty expectations. Tas Melas : 1. Ben Simmons. 2. Donovan Mitchell. 3. Jayson Tatum. Tatum has shown some ridiculous skills handling and shooting. Mitchell is that times two. He\u2019s been the best scorer of the rookie crop, but Simmons gets the edge because he\u2019s been the best lot of things: assisting, rebounding, defending, and, he\u2019s got plenty of scoring touch too. Shaun Powell :  First: Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers. Plays like a poised veteran most of the time, helps in multiple ways (mid-range shot, passing, court awareness, rebounding) and is triggering a turnaround in Philly. Award is his to lose. Second: Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz. He became the primary option almost from opening night, which is rare for a rookie, and thrives even though he hasn\u2019t really played point guard in his life, lacks the benefit of a No. 2 scorer and gets the ball in the crunch. Third: Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics. He suffered through a few lapses, perhaps due to the length of an NBA season, yet had a strong start and appears to be finishing up solidly as well. The Gordon Hayward injury forced him to become a scoring option for a contender and grow up quickly and he has for the most part. John Schuhmann :  1. Ben Simmons, and I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a close race. He\u2019s just been the best all-around player among rookies, making a big impact on both ends of the floor for the fourth place team in the East. 2. Donovan Mitchell. That the Jazz are a middle-of-the-pack offensive team is a huge surprise, and Mitchell is a big part of that. He\u2019s the only guy on the roster who can consistently create a shot for for himself. 3. I\u2019ll give Jayson Tatum an edge over Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma has better raw numbers (points, rebounds and assists per game), but some of that is pace-aided. Tatum has been the more efficient scorer and an integral part of the league\u2019s No. 1 defense.  Sekou Smith :  Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons is first on my list. I know, he\u2019s a redshirt rookie, but he\u2019s a rookie nonetheless. He\u2019s a future superstar based on what we\u2019ve seen from him so far. I feel the same way about Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell , who gets the nod as my rookie surprise for this season. I had no idea he would turn in the kind of season he has. He\u2019s been every bit as crucial to his team\u2019s rise this season as Simmons has been to the Sixers\u2019 renaissance. Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum is third on my list . Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge was wise to swing the deal he did to get a player who fits perfectly into what they\u2019re building. The Celtics are going to be a team to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future and Tatum\u2019s going to be a huge part of that foundation. * Who are your favorites for:  Kia Defensive Player of the Year? | Kia Most Improved Player? | Coach of the Year?"},{"id":41156,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-76ers-what-expect-markelle-fultz-2018-playoffs","date":"2018-03-28","title":"Blogtable: What should Philadelphia 76ers expect from Markelle Fultz in playoffs?","content":"* * * Sixers fans are pumped about the return of No. 1 draft pick Markelle Fultz. What, realistically, should those fans expect from Fultz this postseason?  * * * David Aldridge : Not much, at least not consistently. If he comes off the bench and can give the Sixers six to eight points a game while he\u2019s out there, that would be sufficient, considering he\u2019d played 76 minutes (get it? 76!!) total and missed four months before returning Monday. I just can\u2019t see Fultz being able to get his timing\/wind up to speed to the point where he should be a regular part of the rotation in the playoffs. I guess he could take some of T.J. McConnell\u2019s minutes. But given the roll Philly is on now I\u2019d be surprised if coach Brett Brown altered his lineup to give Fultz a meaningful postseason role. Steve Aschburner :  If Fultz were Michael Jordan, maybe we\u2019d get a 63-point explosion like MJ produced against Boston in the 1986 playoffs when he returned from a season-derailing foot fracture. If he were Wilt Chamberlain, maybe he\u2019d average 22.1 points and 22.2 rebounds in the 1970 playoffs after appearing in only 12 regular-season games due to a knee injury. But Fultz is neither of those legends, as far as we know at this stage, so I\u2019m expecting a rusty, inconsistent player who \u2014 based on what he showed in his return Monday \u2014 might be an \u201cX\u201d factor in one or two games of a playoff series to boost Philadelphia to an extra round. Expecting anything more isn\u2019t fair to Fultz; expecting much less is asking to be proven wrong. Tas Melas :  I don\u2019t think they should expect a lot. He sat for five months, I doubt he\u2019ll be on the floor for one minute of crunch-time this postseason. Baby steps. It was a significant step this week though. It was more about next season than it was this season \u2014 it allows him to work on his game this summer rather than continuously thinking about not playing. That\u2019s when he can potentially evolve in to an elite ball-handler. That being said, their bench needs a boost. They have one of the worst in the league and could use a player who pushes it for his 15 minutes to set other guys up. Playoff pressure is, of course, far different than a game in late March the day after a team clinched its playoff spot. Shaun Powell :  Expectations should be measured for a rookie who\u2019s barely broken a sweat this season, yet it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if Fultz is a bigger asset than expected. Remember, he doesn\u2019t have the wear and tear from the regular season, he gives a different look and speed at point guard and he adds depth. Of course, that\u2019s the best case scenario. It\u2019s all a bonus for the Sixers, who can ride into the postseason pressure-free and maybe cause a shiver or two on the other bench. John Schuhmann :  They should set expectations at zero. Fultz\u2019s ability to get to the basket and finish can be an asset in open-floor situations. But if he\u2019s not comfortable with his jumper outside of the paint (and that seemed to be the case on Monday), he could hurt the half-court offense. The Sixers will always have either Ben Simmons or Joel Embiid on the floor, and those guys need maximum spacing around them. Marco Belinelli obviously offers more spacing than either Fultz or T.J. McConnell, so it\u2019s Fultz vs. McConnell as the primary ball-handler when Simmons sits. The offense has been pretty bad (102 points scored per 100 possessions) with McConnell on the floor this season, so Fultz has a chance to make his case over the last nine games, but right now, I imagine McConnell is more likely to get the call from Brett Brown.  Sekou Smith :  Sixers fans are definitely trusting \u201cThe Process\u201d these days, as they should. There is a lot going according to plan. The emergence of both Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons should inspire everyone in Philly to start dreaming big about the future. But I\u2019d temper the expectations for Markelle Fultz and what he\u2019s going to bring in the playoffs. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to him to expect to play at a high level consistently in the postseason. That would be hard to do for any rookie, but particularly for one who has missed the amount of time he has this season. In fact, whatever positive impact he has this postseason is a bonus, considering where he was just weeks ago in the process."},{"id":41154,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-golden-state-warriors-or-boston-celtics-more-stressed-about-point","date":"2018-03-28","title":"Blogtable: Should Golden State Warriors or Boston Celtics fret more over their star guard's health?","content":"* * * More stressed about the health of their All-Star point guard: Warriors or Celtics?  * * * David Aldridge : Celtics, for sure. The Warriors still have a former Finals MVP and Kia MVP to fall back on in Kevin Durant, who should be back on the floor Thursday , while Stephen Curry heals. Boston doesn\u2019t have anyone remotely resembling Durant to pick up the slack while Kyrie Irving is injured. Coach Brad Stevens will no doubt coach up the remaining players to keep the Celtics competitive, and since both teams are basically locked into second place in their respective conferences, they won\u2019t lose any ground or seeding before the playoffs. But Boston needs Irving (and, Marcus Smart) back on the floor. Steve Aschburner : The Celtics. I get it that the Warriors are playing for higher stakes, with a repeat title and third championship in four years as their prize compared to Boston\u2019s year-early ambitions to, what, reach The Finals? That ought to dial up the stress a little higher for Golden State. But the Warriors\u2019 stash of All-Stars is greater, leaving them more to fall back on if Stephen Curry isn\u2019t fully healthy or even available, compared to Kyrie Irving in the same predicament. I do think coach Steve Kerr is whistling past the graveyard with his claim that the Warriors can beat anyone in the playoffs without Curry, but they can weather his absence or limitations better than the Celtics can with Irving. Tas Melas :  The Celtics. Curry is supposed to be re-evaluated around the opening tip of the playoffs . Even if he misses the first round, is anyone picking against Golden State in subsequent rounds? Losing the engine of the offense actually might act as a catalyst to get this Warriors roster in to playoff mode now. That\u2019s the motive behind coach Steve Kerr\u2019s couple quotes this week \u2014 \u201c There\u2019s no way he\u2019s playing in the first round \u201d and \u201c We can beat anybody in the league without Steph \u201d \u2014 because he realizes there are no pushovers in the West, but also because he\u2019s gently nudging Curry to sit until he\u2019s as close to 100 percent as possible. The Warriors do not want a repeat of Curry in the 2016 Finals , when he didn\u2019t look himself. While the Warriors have a shot against anyone without Curry, Boston without Kyrie \u2014 on the other hand \u2014 does not. A three-to six-week time frame is the prognosis for Irving and him returning after six weeks would put him in to the Eastern Conference semifinals \u2013 a potential matchup with the Cavs. Even if the Cavs aren\u2019t their old selves, they beat a Celtics team who would struggle to score without an elite player in Irving. Shaun Powell :  Right now I\u2019d say the Celtics. Kyrie Irving will be asked to do heavy lifting in terms of minutes and production in the playoffs for a team that really lacks a reliable second option, and he can\u2019t do that if he isn\u2019t 100 percent or worse, suffers a relapse. Yes, the Celtics are perhaps a year away from being taken seriously as title contenders anyway, but Kyrie at least gives them a chance in case something freaky happens to Toronto or Cleveland. The Warriors can deal with little or no Stephen Curry in the first round or perhaps against any team not named the Houston Rockets. Kevin Durant and company can buy time until Curry\u2019s good to go. John Schuhmann :  I\u2019m neither a doctor with expertise on either injury nor am I on the inside of either organization. But personally, I\u2019m more stressed about the health of Stephen Curry. Kyrie Irving is one of two All-Stars on the Celtics, while Curry is one of four on the Warriors, and the absence of Marcus Smart makes Irving\u2019s health more important than it would be otherwise. But, given Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury, Marcus Smart\u2019s injury, and the young talent they have, the Celtics\u2019 timeline is more focused on the future. The Warriors, meanwhile, are built to win a championship right now, they have a legit challenger this season, and they\u2019ve shown the effects of having played into June each of the last three seasons. Even with three other All-Stars, Curry is their most important player. They\u2019ve been more than 14 points per 100 possessions better offensively with Curry on the floor with Thompson and Durant (121.6) than they\u2019ve been with the other two on the floor without Curry (107.2) . And the champs could be facing a dangerous opponent \u2014 Utah (23-4 over the last nine weeks) or Minnesota (with Jimmy Butler back) \u2014 in the first round. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to in this postseason, but the biggest intrigue is with seeing the defending conference champs (Cleveland and Golden State) against the best teams in each conference this season (Toronto and Houston). I want to see those matchups with all four teams at full strength.  Sekou Smith :  The Celtics \u2026 and it\u2019s not even close in my eyes. They don\u2019t have three other All-Stars to lean on if Kyrie Irving\u2019s return from his knee procedure takes longer than expected. The Celtics don\u2019t have a player every bit as good (and in the estimation of most) who is better than Irving (as the Warriors do with Kevin Durant). This isn\u2019t a temporary stress either. Given Irving\u2019s injury history with his knees, there\u2019s even more stress for the Celtics long-term. Having both Irving and Gordon Hayward in street clothes to start the playoffs has to be a painful sight for coach Brad Stevens, given the investment they\u2019ve made in both players. The key to Boston\u2019s chances of going deep in the Eastern Conference playoffs rested on Irving\u2019s ability to play the role of big-game assassin. Without him \u2014 for however long he\u2019s out \u2014 the Celtics seem more vulnerable than they would be otherwise."},{"id":41159,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-would-vote-himself-kia-mvp-award","date":"2018-03-28","title":"LeBron James on season's Kia MVP chase: 'I would vote for me'","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 LeBron James has someone in mind for the MVP award this season. Himself. This is a season where prohibitive MVP favorite James Harden has done phenomenal things with NBA-leading Houston, where reigning MVP Russell Westbrook has been fantastic again for Oklahoma City, and where Anthony Davis has found a new stratosphere to take his game, especially after New Orleans lost DeMarcus Cousins. James raves about them all. But \u2026 \u201cI would vote for me,\u201d James told The Associated Press. \u201cThe body of work, how I\u2019m doing it, what\u2019s been happening with our team all year long, how we\u2019ve got so many injuries and things of that nature, guys in and out, to be able to still keep this thing afloat, I definitely would vote me.\u201d It\u2019s not an unreasonable take. His numbers this season compare favorably \u2014 or exceed \u2014 the five-season run between 2008-09 and 2012-13 where he won the MVP award four times. His averages then: 27.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.3 assists on 52 percent shooting while playing 38 minutes per game. This season\u2019s numbers: 27.4 points, 9.1 assists and 8.6 rebounds on 55 percent shooting. They are MVP-worthy, without question. \u201cHe\u2019s continued to prove everybody wrong and find new levels,\u201d said Miami guard Dwyane Wade, James\u2019 longtime friend and two-time former teammate. \u201cIn his 15th season, to be 33 years of age and to be playing the way he\u2019s playing, as consistent as he\u2019s playing, that is as impressive as anything that anybody has ever done.\u201d Averaging 27 points, nine assists and eight rebounds is an NBA rarity. Oscar Robertson had numbers like those five times, in five consecutive seasons from 1960-61 through 1964-65 (he won his lone MVP award in the 1963-64 season). No one posted averages like that again until last year, when Harden and Westbrook both pulled it off. Robertson, Harden and Westbrook were all twentysomethings when they had those numbers. James is in position to join them, at 33. A fifth MVP wouldn\u2019t define him. He\u2019s long been a Hall of Fame lock, but believes this one would be earned. \u201cAt this point in my career, I\u2019m just trying to break the mold, break the narrative of guys in their 15th year. \u2026 I\u2019m trying to do things that have never been done before,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy because I\u2019m not setting out to do it. It\u2019s just kind of happening organically. I\u2019m just training my body and training my mind and going out and playing and seeing what happens.\u201d The Cavaliers are in the mix to finish as high as No. 3 in the Eastern Conference, despite having 21 different players on the roster, 24 different starting lineups and counting, a slew of injuries, even with head coach Tyronn Lue falling ill and missing games. The season has been rocky. James says he\u2019s been at his best anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve said it,\u201d James said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve had some unbelievable seasons before, but I\u2019ve said it: This is the best I can go, just from a complete basketball player standpoint.\u201d Time will tell if MVP voters agree."},{"id":41161,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/denver-nuggets-sense-urgency-playoff-chase-loss-toronto-raptors","date":"2018-03-28","title":"Denver Nuggets know they are running out of time in playoff chase","content":" Dial the calendar back a month and the Denver Nuggets were 33-28 and owners of the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase .

The Grizzlies had lost 23 of 24 games prior to facing Minnesota at Target Center Monday night. They were 0-for-17 on the road in 2018 , with no reason to expect that to change in Minneapolis, where the Timberwolves were 15-3 in the same span . Memphis scores the fewest points in the league, ranks near the bottom in assorted shooting, rebounding and assists categories, and stacks up opponents at the foul line as if they\u2019re running a TSA checkpoint at O\u2019Hare airport. And yet, playing against their own self-interest as one of the NBA\u2019s lottery teams, the Grizzlies stunned the Wolves on Monday. They handed them  their consensus \u201cworst loss\u201d of the season , a 101-93 defeat. It came nine days after Memphis similarly beat the playoff-hopeful Denver Nuggets 101-94 to end the Grizzlies\u2019 19-game losing streak. Those games gave us, ever so briefly, a glimpse of a good old-fashioned \u201cspoiler,\u201d the likes of which we probably won\u2019t often see anymore. Admit it: The idea that a team headed for the lottery would play \u201cspoiler\u201d \u2013 i.e. playing hard enough to beat an opponent clawing for the postseason or maneuvering for a better seeding \u2014 seems a tad quaint these days. Teams near the bottom of the standings are far less interested in 2018 in moral victories or instilling some noble sense of competition and winning \u2013 as if pluckiness in March or April would survive a long offseason of player movement, roster overhauls and other changes. Rather, they (or at least their management teams) are eager to close out an already difficult season by salting away as many lottery chances down the stretch as they can snag. The ol\u2019 game of scoreboard watching ain\u2019t what it used to be. \u201cThe Process\u201d trumps the pride. There\u2019s no bugler in the distance, because no cavalry is coming. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. Every day I\u2019m watching the scores and I\u2019m like, \u2018Aw, man, c\u2019mon, give us some help,\u2019 \u201d Minnesota\u2019s Taj Gibson said earlier this month. \u201cThen we turn around, we end up playing them and they \u2026 It\u2019s just difficult.\u201d The slate of games on April 9 would seem like a spoiler\u2019s paradise: Sacramento at San Antonio, Cleveland at New York, Orlando at Milwaukee, Memphis back at Minnesota. Based on what just transpired at Target Center, a bunch of also-rans could seriously tinker with the playoff bracket. Except they\u2019re not incentivized to do so, to use current jargon. So, Gibson said: \u201cYou just have to go out there and worry about yourself. You can\u2019t depend on anybody to try to win games for you.\u201d Traditionally this would have been a ripe season for spoilers, given how tightly grouped the final four or five playoff slots are in each conference. Factor in the Nuggets and the LA Clippers in the West and there are \u201cupset\u201d opportunities nearly every night for lottery-bound teams. After beating Minnesota, the Grizzlies said lots of good things about playing the right way and working hard. But none of them seemed to express any zeal for jamming a stick in the Wolves\u2019 gears. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to win, it kind of confirms and reassures guys,\u201d Grizzlies center Marc Gasol said. Said coach J.B. Bickerstaff: \u201cWe don\u2019t sulk, we don\u2019t moan, we don\u2019t whine. We show up and we work, and they bought into that and they have been willing to do it.\u201d Bickerstaff, an ex-Timberwolves assistant and former University of Minnesota standout, might have wanted to avoid embarrassment in bringing his odd-lot crew into town. But he also has friends among the Wolves and certainly wasn\u2019t looking to purposely extend their 14-year playoff drought. Besides, eight of Minnesota\u2019s losses have been to Brooklyn, Orlando, Atlanta, Chicago, Phoenix (twice) and Memphis (twice). What the Grizzlies did to them might be less about spoiling a playoff aspirant\u2019s trajectory than that team misfiring on its own. Some NBA folks don\u2019t see a big change, because they see teams that play hard and always prefer to win as universals in this league. \u201cCoaches and players are going out there and competing at the very highest level,\u201d Boston\u2019s Brad Stevens said recently in Chicago. \u201cYou see that with the Bulls team \u2014 they\u2019re playing hard, they\u2019re playing together. \u2026 You have to be great on that given night. I\u2019ve been part of a 25-win team before and I know how badly you want to go out there and put your best foot forward.\u201d Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, however, said that teams at the top of the standings can and rightly do put their agendas ahead of sheer, late-regular-season competition. \u201cThe more interesting one for me,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cis when teams are locked in for the playoffs and may need some rest at the end of the year. We may be playing a team that factors into the playoffs [so] what do we do? My philosophy goes, \u2018Take care of your own team. If a guy needs a rest, give him a rest.\u2019 \u201cPeople who need that other opponent to lose or something may be upset, but you can\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Then comes human nature, which can make it appear that some lottery team has unfairly roared to life against your favorite team \u2026 but not against your rivals. \u201cIt always seems like they play you harder than the last team they just played,\u201d Gibson said, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018C\u2019mon man!\u2019 But that\u2019s part of the NBA. You never know. Somebody can get hot that night, or that team has some reason to be feeling good, and can give you hell. You have to withstand the force and keep playing hard. \u201cBut you can\u2019t depend on anybody.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Davis came down on Ferguson\u2019s back, and Davis shoved him as the two fell toward the ground. Ferguson got up quickly and went after Davis, and a skirmish followed.

(AP) \u2014 Zeke Upshaw, a swingman for the Detroit Pistons\u2019 G League affiliate who collapsed on the court during a game over the weekend, died Monday. Upshaw, 26, died at a hospital, the Grand Rapids Drive said . No cause was disclosed. He collapsed Saturday night near the end of a game against the Long Island Nets. The Pistons held a moment of silence in Upshaw\u2019s memory Monday night before their home game against the Los Angeles Lakers. The G League also pushed back the start of its playoffs, delaying not just the Drive\u2019s upcoming game but the entire first round. \u201cZeke was an outstanding young man whose powerful belief in himself and uncommon perseverance led to a successful professional basketball career,\u201d G League president Malcolm Turner said in a news release. \u201cA beloved member of the Grand Rapids Drive, Zeke\u2019s continuous improvement and tireless work ethic were hallmarks of his career.\u201d Upshaw\u2019s mother, Jewel Upshaw, released a statement thanking the team and fans. Team owner Steve Jbara said the Grand Rapids area was fortunate to enjoy Upshaw\u2019s commitment to the community, especially children. Numerous NBA players posted messages of sorrow after Upshaw\u2019s death was announced. Some members of the Pistons scrawled tributes on the sneakers they wore for their game Monday night, as did Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers. \u201cLost a real one today,\u201d Pistons star Andre Drummond wrote on Twitter. \u201cTragic loss of Zeke Upshaw, my thoughts and prayers are with all of Zeke\u2019s family and friends during this difficult time. \u2026 Rest easy my guy.\u201d Upshaw scored 11 points in Saturday\u2019s 101-99 win for Grand Rapids, which secured the Drive a spot in the G League playoffs . The Drive and Toronto affiliate Raptors 905 are scheduled to play in a single-elimination playoff game on Friday at Mississauga, Ontario. That game was originally slated to be played on Wednesday. Upshaw was on defense Saturday night and coming out of a timeout with 49 seconds left when he appeared to stumble while chasing a Long Island player across the court. The video feed of the game showed Upshaw moments later motionless, lying face down. A referee stopped the game immediately, and Drive medical personnel were at Upshaw\u2019s side within seconds. He was carried away on a stretcher and taken to a nearby hospital. It\u2019s not clear if he ever regained consciousness. Upshaw started his college basketball career at Illinois State, averaging 1.6 points in 100 games with the Redbirds. He graduated with a degree in apparel, merchandising and design. The Chicago native then transferred to Hofstra, where his numbers soared in the 2013-14 season. He started all 33 games in his one season with the Pride, averaging 19.8 points. \u201cZeke was one of the kindest and hardest-working student-athletes I have had the privilege to coach,\u201d Hofstra coach Joe Mihalich said. \u201cZeke laid the groundwork for the success we are having now and we will never forget the impact he had on Hofstra basketball. Our entire program is heartbroken that he is no longer with us but his influence will continue to be felt throughout the Pride family.\u201d Upshaw was undrafted and played internationally in Slovenia and Luxembourg. He spent most of the last two seasons with the Drive, appearing in 75 games primarily as a reserve and averaging 7.6 points."},{"id":41171,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/markelle-fultz-gives-76ers-lift-gets-bigger-one-return","date":"2018-03-27","title":"Markelle Fultz gives Philadelphia 76ers lift in long-awaited return","content":"For the Philadelphia 76ers, \u201cThe Process\u201d has featured an unintentional step along the way to completion. For each of its individual members, there is a right of passage of sorts preceded by months of anticipation. *  Sixers 123, Nuggets 104 Joel Embiid enjoyed the ritual two years and two foot surgeries after being drafted third overall in 2014 . Fellow 2014 draftee Dario Saric basked in its glow after two years of playing overseas. Ben Simmons received the honor on opening night this season after his own foot issues delayed the debut of 2016\u2019s top overall pick. On Monday, it was Markelle Fultz\u2019s turn. After 68 games of waiting for and wondering about last summer\u2019s No. 1 overall pick , 76ers fans welcomed him back to \u201cThe Process\u201d the same way they did his predecessors: with a standing ovation. Initially, it appeared Fultz would not need such ceremony. The biggest question about him was his potential fit next to Simmons, a forward who passed like Hall of Famer Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson \u2026 and shot like former journeyman center Ervin Johnson . That didn\u2019t stop the Sixers from trading their third pick and a future pick for the right to draft him. As the 2017-18 season began, something was wrong. Fultz couldn\u2019t shoot anymore and when he did, he looked off or broken. A mysterious shoulder injury sacked some of his confidence and after just four games, he was shut down indefinitely . * Playoff Picture:  If the season ended today Over the next 68 games, Fultz became more myth than man. The 76ers would occasionally issue generic updates of his progress via physiotherapy. Grainy footage of Fultz\u2019s atrocious shooting practices surfaced on Twitter. Last month, Sixers general manager Bryan Colangelo said he was unsure if Fultz would play this season . That statement came less than a week after Fultz had advanced to playing 5-on-5 scrimmages. Colangelo\u2019s comments in February described the saga best: \u201cThere\u2019s always a chance that he\u2019s going to be out there soon, and there\u2019s a chance that he\u2019s not going to play this year. I can\u2019t answer that question because we don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d On Monday, Colangelo (and the 76ers) could. Fultz was finally playing. When he stepped onto the court for the first time since Oct. 23 , the drama over his absence melted away under a wave of applause. He rewarded that faith with an extremely rookie-like performance. First, he logged a turnover and a foul. Then came a picturesque layup and a behind-the-back pass to Joel Embiid that wowed the crowd. By halftime, Fultz\u2019s impact had already been felt: six minutes, two points, three assists, one rebound, and a plus-four rating . In the second half, Fultz picked up steam. He drove into a defender, flipped the ball up with his back to the basket, and banked it in perfectly. Seconds later, he again attacked off a cut, saw a defender rotate, and released the layup a split second sooner than he normally would have to avoid getting his shot rejected. It appeared Fultz\u2019s night might be done. With the Sixers having blown the game open, however, fans got antsy and began chanting his name. Coach Brett Brown finally relented. The 19-year-old rewarded his patient fans with perhaps the best proof of having truly come back: a crossover and pull-up jump shot that sent the home crowd into a frenzy. \u201dI thought they were saying \u2018Nick Foles,\u2019 \u201d Fultz told reporters after the game, speaking about the Super Bowl MVP for the champion Philadelphia Eagles. \u201dThen I realized it, and it was pretty dope. These fans are great, and I love them.\u201d Just like that, the rookie\u2019s long-awaited return was over. His final stat line: 14 minutes, 10 points (5-13 FG), eight assists, four rebounds, and an impressive plus-16 . \u201dHe looked confident,\u201d Brown told reporters after the game. \u201dI thought it was a real, sort of bold, gutsy effort that he made given where he was now where he is.\u201d"},{"id":41170,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-los-angeles-lakers-isaiah-thomas-goes-new-york-hip-evlauation","date":"2018-03-27","title":"Reports: Los Angeles Lakers' Isaiah Thomas leaves team to get hip evaluation in New York","content":" The pain in Isaiah Thomas\u2019 hip has not subsided, and the Los Angeles Lakers guard has reportedly traveled across the country to seek further medical evaluation. According to Lakers beat reporter Mike Trudell and Tania Ganguli of The Los Angeles Times , the two-time All-Star guard has gone to New York in hopes of finding a solution for the injury that has compromised his ability to play since last year\u2019s postseason. Thomas has played in just 17 games this season after initially suffering the injury with the Boston Celtics last spring . Here\u2019s more from Ganguli on what is next for Thomas going forward : Thomas has only shown flashes of the player that rocketed to stardom with the Celtics. Overall, he is shooting a career-worst 38.3 percent from the field while committing a career-high 3.2 turnovers per game . The Cavaliers, who dealt Kyrie Irving in exchange for Thomas during the offseason, quickly moved on from the 5-foot-9 point guard once it became clear he was not the same player. Cleveland dealt him to Los Angeles at the trade deadline , where he hoped to re-establish at least some of his value before hitting unrestricted free agency this summer.

All-Star center Joel Embiid tweeted a GIF of WWE star The Undertaker rising from a casket. Fultz\u2019s season has certainly sprung back to life. With a playoff berth clinched for the first time since 2012 and only 10 games left, Fultz decided the time was right to come back from an injured shoulder and busted confidence that had cost him all but four games of his rookie season. Fultz, who did not speak to the media, came off the bench against Denver. \u201cIt was his decision,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fluid. I get goosebumps telling you all that. I\u2019m so proud of him. The people around him have done great things. I give that kid credit.\u201d The 19-year-old Fultz played the 76ers\u2019 first four games of the season but has been sidelined since. He was ruled out indefinitely in October with soreness and a scapular muscle imbalance in the shoulder. The team announced Dec. 9 the soreness was gone, the imbalance had been resolved, and he was going to participate in \u201celevated on-court basketball activities.\u201d Then on Jan. 2, the team announced Fultz had been cleared to begin the final stage of his \u201creturn-to-play program.\u201d The whole saga has mostly been a mystery, from likely return dates to the origin of the injury. \u201cThe cause is unknown at this stage,\u201d team president Bryan Colangelo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where it started, when it started. But it was some time from the time we saw him in summer league \u2026 to something that very quickly rose to awareness in late September, early October.\u201d Fultz struggled with his mechanics when he did play, and his shooting form was widely mocked around the NBA. No one in the organization can pinpoint when Fultz\u2019s form went awry, though he\u2019s had soreness since the summer. \u201cThis recovery was a little bit longer than expected,\u201d Colangelo said. The 76ers traded the No. 3 overall pick and a future first-round pick to the Boston Celtics for the No. 1 pick with the intention of drafting Fultz. Fultz, a 6-foot-4 guard, kept a low profile and the only updates came from media shooting his video drills where he usually seemed to have little range, an inability to hit catch-and-shoot jumpers and an awkward form. The scrutiny surrounding his broken shot rattled the University of Washington star and he seemingly had been healthy enough to play \u2014 but his morale needed as much of a lift as his jumper. \u201cNever was it at a stage where it definitely was going to happen,\u201d Brown said. \u201cToday, I felt something good with the performance he has been having in practices and some workouts. You could tell he has a confidence and a spirit.\u201d Fultz averaged 6 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in his four games this season. He didn\u2019t attempt a 3-pointer. Colangelo said he didn\u2019t know if Fultz would play in the summer league. \u201cThe risk-reward, I\u2019m going to lean on reward,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s different than anything that we have.\u201d Colangelo said a drop-dead return date was never established, though the Sixers were getting closer to having one. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be setback along the way in terms of your confidence,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cI\u2019m not even certain we can he\u2019s 100 percent. But he\u2019s 100 percent ready to get out on the floor in his own mind.\u201d Led by Embiid and rookie of the year favorite Ben Simmons, the Sixers have won 42 games and put one of the worst stretches of basketball in NBA history behind them. \u201cThe Process\u201d orchestrated by former general manager Sam Hinkie and now led by Colangelo has seemingly worked \u2014 and a healthy, confident Fultz could only make the Sixers a force in the Eastern Conference for years ahead."},{"id":41173,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-wall-practices-return-unsure","date":"2018-03-26","title":"John Wall practices, remains unsure on return to lineup","content":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Washington Wizards point guard John Wall is not planning to change his style whatsoever when he returns from his latest knee surgery \u2013 whenever that might be. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be John Wall,\u201d he said Monday after the second full-contact practice of his comeback from an operation on Jan. 31. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know how to do.\u201d The All-Star declared himself \u201cfeeling great\u201d but said he is not sure when he will be able to play in a game for the Wizards, who desperately need help at the moment. Washington has lost three consecutive games heading into Tuesday night against the visiting San Antonio Spurs; coach Scott Brooks said Wall will not play in that one. \u201cIt\u2019s getting close. He\u2019s had two really, really good days. His energy level is high. He\u2019s anxious. You can tell.

He said he lost about 10 or 15 pounds during his rehab, without intending to. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft out of Kentucky had surgery on both of his knees before last season. This time, Brooks said, Wall has been able to do pretty much everything as usual in his pair of full-fledged practices, including dunk. \u201cHe\u2019s getting his rhythm back.

There\u2019s only a handful of guys \u2013 maybe not even that \u2013 that can do it in the NBA,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best players in the league.\u201d As for Wall himself?

The 26-year-old passed away earlier today at Spectrum Heath with family by his side.  Upshaw collapsed to the court with 40 seconds remaining in the Drive\u2019s victory over Long Island on Saturday night and was transported to the hospital. With privacy and respect for the Upshaw family, no other medical information will be disseminated. \u201cThe entire Grand Rapids Drive family is mourning the tragic loss of Zeke Upshaw,\u201d said Steve Jbara, owner of the Grand Rapids Drive. \u201cZeke had a warm personality and was a tremendous representative of our organization both on and off the court. Grand Rapids was fortunate to be the benefactor of two seasons of Zeke\u2019s commitment to the youth and non-profits within our community. Our thoughts are with all of Zeke\u2019s family and friends during this difficult time.\u201d NBA G League president Malcolm Turner released the following statement regarding the passing of Upshaw: Upshaw was a two-year player for the Drive, drafted in the fourth round of the G League\u2019s Developmental Draft in 2016. Undrafted by the NBA, he previously played overseas before joining the Drive. Upshaw appeared in 41 games with the Drive this season, averaging 8.5 points and 2.3 rebounds in 19.8 minutes per game.

So, with the playoffs exactly 19 days away, it\u2019s not a good time for two of the best teams in the league to be dealing with injuries to their most important offensive players. On Friday, in his first game back from an ankle injury, Stephen Curry suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee . Less than 24 hours later, Kyrie Irving underwent a procedure to relieve irritation in his left knee. The timelines for both Curry and Irving are fuzzy. The Celtics announced on Saturday that Irving \u201cis expected to return to basketball activities in 3-6 weeks.\u201d Three weeks from Saturday is the first day of the playoffs, six weeks could be too late, and \u201cbasketball activities\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean playing in a game. Steve Kerr made it clear on Sunday that Curry won\u2019t be playing in the first round , though Curry himself wasn\u2019t nearly as set on a timeline. Potential first round opponents for the Warriors include the Utah Jazz, who are 23-4 over the last couple of months, and the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were the 4 seed before losing Jimmy Butler to injury a month ago. (Butler\u2019s status going into the playoffs remains pretty critical, too.) The Celtics and Warriors are both dealing with other injuries, as well. Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart (thumb) is out through at least the first round, but the champs should be getting Klay Thompson (thumb), Kevin Durant (ribs) and Draymond Green (pelvis) back soon. All we can do is wait and see how this all plays out \u2026 and hope that everybody else stays healthy.

You have watched the episode of \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d where Jack and Chrissy have a misunderstanding. You have watched the old NFL games on YouTube, including the commercials (man, did they drive some ugly cars back in the day). You have played 7,451 hands of online Solitaire. And sleep still avoids you, taunting you from a distance. Over here! Over here! Everyone else in the house sleeps soundly, as they do most every night, leaving you to try and catch up. When \u2014 if \u2014 you do finally fall asleep, the morning comes rudely, quickly, and the alarms go off, and the children and spouse and pets rise. Their days begins anew. Yours is not yet over. Or, it is barely over. This is the life of an insomniac. It\u2019s hard to make people who sleep well understand how difficult it is to function with little or no sleep. You operate in a fog the following day, or days. You\u2019re awake but you can\u2019t concentrate on anything for very long. The deprivation stabs at your reserves of energy; exercise is one of the first victims of regular sleeplessness. To try and wake yourself up to the point of productivity, you slam coffee, energy drinks, anything with sugar, everything with sugar. It should not surprise that a regular diet of coffee, energy drinks and sugar-laden foods is not ideal for one\u2019s metabolism. Tired people are cranky. Tired people make mistakes. Tired people are \u2026 well, me. I am Lily Von Schtupp . It doesn\u2019t happen every night, or every week, or every month. But it happens, way too regularly. I inherited a light sleeping pattern from my pops, so everything tends to wake me up \u2014 a car speeding down a nearby street, two people talking as they walk up the block. A dog. A bird. Wind. Everything wakes me up. And, in my job, I travel a lot. That doesn\u2019t help. Bed and pillow quality on the road is, shall we say, sporadic. (Then there\u2019s the occasional kegger and\/or mix tape release party down the hall.) Add to this stew the normal 3 a.m. terrors: your family, job, money, future, death. Living in our current, uh, political atmosphere. You know it\u2019s going to be one of those nights when all those thoughts rush by as if on the Acela to New York, and you can\u2019t stop processing them. Massaging them. Contemplating them. Closing eyes, counting to 50 and back \u2026 nothing works. Time for Jack and Chrissy. And I have about one-millionth of the stress that an NBA coach has, every day. The workload they have, even for those with great assistant coaches and video staff, is unending. They have to make a hundred decisions every day: when to practice, and how long. How to try and guard LeBron James or Kevin Durant or James Harden (and with whom). Patting one guy on the back while kicking another in the behind. Working with the general manager (if they\u2019re lucky and don\u2019t have a bad relationship with their boss). Media demands in the morning, afternoon and night. Handling irate agents who want more playing time and shots for their clients; looking at their team and their opponents on tape, over and over and over. Then there\u2019s the games. And the families. They get paid a lot of money, yes. They also get fired way more frequently than Joe in accounting or Lisa in Human Resources. And that intense pressure to win or else, to find a way to beat LeBron or Durant or Harden, has to go somewhere. Sometimes, it builds and then blows. \u201cWe\u2019re all told what to do, but we don\u2019t do it,\u201d one coach said Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re all told we have to eat healthy, we have to exercise and we have to get our sleep. All of us. Every coach. This is not like, \u2018oh, wow, I never thought of that.\u2019 But it\u2019s hard to do it.\u201d In December, Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford took a leave of absence to deal with debilitating headaches \u2014 which, he found out after extensive testing, were being caused by sleep deprivation. And last week, Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue stepped back from coaching what is still, along with the Golden State Warriors, the league\u2019s most talked about team, after having chest pains and other physical problems \u2014 which also included lack of sleep. \u201cI ain\u2019t slept in days,\u201d Lue said back in November, after the Cavaliers had stumbled to a 3-5 start. Clifford returned to work in Charlotte in January after missing 21 games. Lue is scheduled to return to the Cavs this week after taking a week off to work with doctors on a new regimen. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been able to do is retrain my body to sleep more,\u201d Clifford said by phone Sunday. \u201cYou get into these stretches with your work where it\u2019s not a regular sleep, you don\u2019t get into a normal routine. And you get used to not sleeping. For me, basically, as I got older, my body at 56 is just not going to accept not sleeping as it did at, say, 46.\u201d Clifford had been dealing with his physical problems for two years before he took a seat. The headaches led to losing sleep, which led to more headaches. His doctors told him that he was running the risk of developing chronic migraines \u2014 and anyone who\u2019s had one of those, much less a dozen, knows that\u2019s a road down which one does not want to go. \u201cAs the headaches got worse, I just used stronger medication,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cAnd what you learn with headaches is that the medication is like a band aid. You\u2019re not taking care of the headaches. A year ago they made me do an MRI to make sure there was nothing there, and it wasn\u2019t. But this year it got to the point where it was just so difficult to function during the day he said \u2018look, you\u2019re going to have to take some time off here.\u2019 \u201d The tipping point for Clifford came in early December. \u201cWe had a game with Orlando here and one of my assistants, Pat Delaney, was here,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cI had been here for about an hour and the headache was so bad I called him in and said \u2018look, you\u2019re going to have to do this shootaround.\u2019 I went to drive home and I was shaking. It was so bad I couldn\u2019t drive. I had to walk home.\u201d For Clifford, the task was simple: he didn\u2019t have to change how he did his job; he had to change the way he lived. He grew up around grinders. He was hired by Jeff Van Gundy in New York as an assistant in 2001, joining a staff that included Tom Thibodeau, Don Chaney and Kevin O\u2019Neill. Chaney had already been a coach and was NBA Coach of the Year in 1990. The other three assistants all also became coaches. They all got in early and stayed late. But Clifford had to change. \u201cI set an alarm every morning, and when I wake up I don\u2019t get out of bed until the alarm goes off,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me. I sleep now, easily, six hours a lot, six and a half, whatever. At this level it\u2019s made an incredible difference in how I feel. I don\u2019t get as tired, especially in the afternoons, which had become more of a problem for me the last couple of years. For the games, I\u2019m not as tired. I\u2019m better later in the day.\u201d Sleep has been a prime topic for years. The NBA started the regular season two weeks early to eliminate all but a handful of the dreaded four-games-in-five-nights that was a staple of schedules for decades \u2014 which in turn would help players be better rested and less susceptible to injury. The science of the impact of the schedule is so on-point that correctly predicting \u201cschedule losses\u201d because of expected fatigue has become almost commonplace . Almost every NBA team has a performance staff that works nonstop on finding ways to maximize production. Teams have implemented all manner of changes during the past few years to help their players get more and better sleep. They\u2019ve utilized sleep-study experts to minimize disruptions in travel and given their players monitors to wear on their wrists to measure the quality of their sleep. Potent elixirs that promise more restful sleep come on the market every year. The Houston Rockets and other teams have done away with most shootarounds on the road, opting for pregame walkthroughs a couple of hours before tipoff so their players can sleep in after arriving in a new city. Other teams have done the same at home, pushing practice times back the day after home games so their players don\u2019t have to be in at 8 a.m. after logging 30-plus minutes the night before. Some teams have tried to stay on their regular time zone clocks, meaning a West coast team coming East would let its players stay out late after arriving rather than have them get to bed early , so they could stay in their natural rhythm as they would have at home. Many teams now stay where they are after road games, rather than get on planes for late-night charters that don\u2019t arrive in the next city until 2 or 3 a.m. local time. This is especially helpful for teams that lose an hour or two going West to East. But despite all those innovations and tinkering, coaches like Clifford and Lue still are struggling to get enough rest, exacerbating pre-existing conditions. Some players take losses to heart, to be sure. But coaches wear them like a woolen coat. Numerous coaches have spoken of walking the streets in their home cities after especially grueling losses, replaying key moments repeatedly in their minds. To get some idea of how the grind of a season impacts NBA head coaches, I surveyed all of them last week, excluding Cleveland\u2019s interim coach, Larry Drew (his sleep pattern likely not being what it was before Lue announced his sabbatical), contacting them either directly or through their team\u2019s public relations staffs. Of the 29 contacted, 19, including Clifford, had responded as of Monday morning. Coaches got three questions: 1. How much sleep do you get per night? 2. Is it enough? 3. If not, how does it affect you and what are you trying to do to get more? (And, for obvious reasons, we won\u2019t be quoting the respondents by name.) The gamut ran from three hours of sleep per night to as much as eight. Most coaches said they get somewhere around six hours a night. \u201cI\u2019d get more if we won,\u201d one coach cracked. \u201c[Rockets coach Mike] D\u2019Antoni probably sleeps well.\u201d One coach who said he gets between seven and eight hours augments that with daily naps, and tries to eliminate the bane of everyone who lives the NBA life \u2013 late-night meals and booze. \u201cI get plenty,\u201d said another coach who says he gets eight hours. \u201cThe tough thing for me is when we fly late at night and get in at 3 a.m. That jacks me up for a day or two.\u201d One coach who gets six hours on average per night said he\u2019s \u201ctired and fatigued all the time.\u201d He would love to get more sleep, but it\u2019s almost impossible. He tries to compensate by taking naps on game days for half an hour up to 45 minutes. But the familiarity of the grind almost works against a normal lifestyle. \u201cIf I\u2019m able to get eight hours of sleep, I\u2019m almost sore the next day,\u201d another coach said. \u201cI feel kind of stiff. It\u2019s weird. Obviously the answer to something like this is more sleep. Ultimately I just try to spend as much time with my family as I can. If I can drive (my kids) to school in the morning that\u2019s therapy itself. I know I need the sleep, but it\u2019s like being a player. It\u2019s hard going through 82 games, but you have to train yourself. The thing I\u2019ve slacked on is the workouts. I try to get in the gym more. If I can get 30-45 minutes a day, five days a week, I feel really good.\u201d Several coaches mentioned regular exercise as vital. One coach has benefitted from incorporating meditation into his daily routine. Another is seeing a sleep therapist. \u201cI try to eat as healthy as I can and get away from my job and get on the court and play pick-up games,\u201d another coach said. \u201cI try to do that three times a week. When I do that three times or four times a week, I don\u2019t sleep better, but my body feels worse.\u201d But many still struggle to decompress. Moving from assistant coach to coach, as so many have noted in the past, is among the most difficult 12 inches anyone has to navigate. \u201cI really average about 4 to 5 hours a night,\u201d one texted. \u201cI\u2019ve always had trouble sleeping. Very difficult to turn your mind off. Always thinking about tomorrow (next game, rotations, lineup changes, injuries, etc). It\u2019s a very hard way to live. I\u2019m not a pill taker so I don\u2019t take any kind of medication \u2026 I don\u2019t think people have any idea how stressful these jobs are. You are judged daily.\u201d One veteran coach who gets between six and seven hours of sleep nightly feels the difference when he doesn\u2019t. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get six I struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cLight headed and irritable. When I don\u2019t sleep I don\u2019t eat right. The main thing I need is a workout. If I work out I sleep better and have a good, healthy appetite. In the past year I have made myself sleep, work out and eat better.\u201d Location also matters. \u201cI definitely sleep better on the West coast, because I love to watch all the late games,\u201d another coach said. \u201cSleep hours depend on so many things: travel, time zone changes, game nights, non-game nights. It would be impossible to be consistent and therein is the problem. There are nights I get 5-6 hours, and others where I get 7-8. It\u2019s tough to nap, but if I can get 45 minutes on a game day, that helps. Again, knowing I will be up to 1 a.m. working on postgame edits (is difficult). I\u2019m trying to go to bed earlier when (the) opportunity is presented and take short naps in the afternoons. It\u2019s tough when so many things are going through your mind.\u201d But, like their players, most coaches are Type As, Alpha males. They try to push through and adapt. \u201cNow, I can sleep anywhere,\u201d one coach said. \u201cI\u2019m going in now; we\u2019ve got practice at noon. If I go home and take a nap, that usually would mess me up at night. Now, I can sleep anywhere. We got on the plane and I said \u2018I have to close my eyes.\u2019 It was a short flight, but I did it.\u201d Clifford coached Lue when the latter played in Houston and Orlando. He spoke with Lue last week and the Cavs\u2019 coach said he was already feeling better. But Clifford knows that has to be followed up by changing habits, permanently. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned, the two things are listen to your body and do what the doctors tell you to do,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cIt sounds simple, but for me it\u2019s worked well.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Wes Unseld won his two in 1968, and for most of the next three decades that followed, he did everything the Washington Bullets asked \u2014 play center in D.C. for 13 years, coach the team for seven, run it as general manager for seven more. He had his biggest successes by far, though, as a player, a human wall who eviscerated those who were caught off guard when they ran into one of his teeth-chattering picks and screens. He was named one of the 50 greatest players of all time in 1996 , which followed his Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame selection in 1988. He had a very close relationship with the Bullets\u2019 owner, the late Abe Pollin, and a contentious one at times with his fellow Hall of Fame teammate, Elvin Hayes . But the two big men were the foundation upon which the Washington franchise became one of the league\u2019s best in the 1970s, making four Finals in nine seasons. They won just once in four tries, but that breakthrough, in 1978 , marked the height of Unseld\u2019s career as a player. That group celebrated the 40th anniversary of that championship, in seven games against the Seattle SuperSonics, this past weekend in Washington. Unseld, now 72, didn\u2019t attend, having been slowed by health problems in the last few years. But he was as feisty as ever on the telephone. His NBA time now is spent watching his son, Wes, Jr., an assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets, and the occasional Wizards game. But the old man is special to me. He was the coach when I first started covering the NBA, in 1988, as the beat guy for The Washington Post, and for five years, while covering five bad teams (their best mark during that stretch was 40-42) he never, ever lied, not once \u2014 about his team, about himself, about anything. It was such a disappointment to learn that everyone in the NBA wasn\u2019t that way. Me: You made four Finals in the \u201870s, but you only won the one title in 1978. Your team was clearly good enough to win more. How tough was it to finally break through, even with a good team? Wes Unseld: That part is true. You\u2019ve got to have a good team, and you\u2019ve got to have a lot of luck. The situations have got to be when you go into it, you don\u2019t have injuries. Back then, you couldn\u2019t replace people. You couldn\u2019t go out and find a person \u2014 not as good as the person who got hurt, but even somebody who was comparable to be able to help you. You can do that pretty much today up to a certain time period. And then the fact that there was probably more equal opportunities for other teams to be around at that time. So it was difficult, and it was luck. Everything had to play into it. Me: You\u2019ve said in \u201978 that the biggest thing that broke right for you is that the team got healthy just before the playoffs started. WU: That\u2019s exactly what I was talking about. Everyone was talking about our record at the time (44-38 in the regular season, the lowest for any team that went on to win the championship). Hell, I don\u2019t think we ever had that starting five on the floor for any period of time that whole season. Bobby (Dandridge) was out. Elvin had injuries. I don\u2019t know if I was out. We just never could get everyone on the court at the same time. And once we did, right before the end of the season, eight or 10 games before the end of the season, we started to get things back together. We knew if we could stay injury-free, we could scare people. I didn\u2019t know if we could beat some of those teams, but we could scare the hell out of them. Me: You got the 76ers in the conference finals, and they\u2019d been the favorites all season in the East. So what did you think was important to beating them? WU: I don\u2019t know what I was thinking was the key. I don\u2019t think they had anybody who could stop Elvin. Our problem was, did we have anybody who could stop J (Julius Erving)? But we felt we could compete with them, because Bobby could play him as well as anybody in the league, and he had a tough time playing Bobby. Who was the center at the time? Caldwell Jones. Caldwell was good. He did a lot of good things for that team. The matchups would be critical, and we could match up with them. Me: What got you over the hump in that series? WU: We knew we could play with them and we could win. My problem was I got hurt. I twisted my ankle really bad, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m in a cast now \u2026 it was just one of those things where we knew we could beat them, all things being equal. Me: Did you think as those playoffs went on, I might not get too many more shots at this? WU: I guarantee you that was my sense, and at one point I told the guys, as far as I\u2019m concerned, this is my last shot at this thing. I made no bones about it. I felt if we didn\u2019t do it this time I wasn\u2019t going to get it done. Me: Did the sweeps in \u201971 and \u201975 weigh on you?  WU: Sure. It did. Because I\u2019d been there before and it sort of slipped away, and I recalled we could have had it if things had gone right and we\u2019d played a little better. But you\u2019ve got to give the other teams credit, too. But I remember talking to (guard) Larry Wright, and I told Larry you\u2019ve only going to get so many shots, and then somebody upstairs is going to say all right, you had it, it\u2019s time to move to somebody else. Me: That year, Portland was the defending champion and had been the prohibitive favorite to come out of the West again before Bill Walton went down. So what did you know about Seattle? WU: I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t think we were going to be there, either. CBS didn\u2019t think so. They thought it would be Philly. Me: The Finals with Seattle were back and forth. What was it like playing in them? WU: All I could think of going through it was this was my last shot. That was the only thing that I remember about The Finals. And the person I expressed it to \u2014 probably wore the man out \u2014 was Frank Herzog (the radio play-by-play man). I\u2019m sure Frank got tired as hell of me. We had dinner together, would hang out together. That was the only thing I think I thought about. I wasn\u2019t down about the things that I\u2019d accomplished, but I just wanted to get over the hump that time. Me: So in Game 7, there were two big plays \u2014 your sixth man Charles Johnson hitting a halfcourt shot at the end of the third quarter, and Mitch Kupchak\u2019s big three-point play with 1:30 left off a loose ball when you were just up by four. But it was 101-99 with 12 seconds left when the Sonics fouled you in the backcourt to put you on the line. So I could ask you what you were thinking when you went to the line \u2014 WU: I was thinking I didn\u2019t want to be there. Me: Is that right? WU: Yeah. Put somebody up there who could make \u2018em. Me: So great players get spooked then too, huh? WU: Well, if great players tell the truth. Me: So how did you calm your nerves? WU: I don\u2019t know. All I remember telling myself was \u2018okay, when miss this one, you\u2019re going to have to go back downcourt and you\u2019re going to have to get a rebound or block a shot. Do something.\u2019 That\u2019s basically what I told myself. But I made one, and then I think (Bullets coach Dick) Motta called a timeout. And I\u2019ve told him over the years, I said \u2018what the hell you start coaching now for?\u2019 Freezing me. I made it and he called time out. Make me think about it some more. Me: But you made the last one, too. WU: Yeah, I made it. It was not something I was wishing for. Me: So you\u2019re up four and then Dennis Johnson (who went 0 for 14 from the floor in that game) missed, and you got the last rebound. WU: Yeah, I got it, and then I made my shovel pass up to Bobby. Me: So was that \u2018I see Bobby open down the floor\u2019 or \u2018get this ball out of my hands?\u2019 WU: Get the ball out of my hands before they foul me again \u2026 get it away from me. In that time they could foul you off the ball. And I figured he could score before they fouled me. Then I ran for someplace to hide so they couldn\u2019t foul me.  Me: So he goes in for the breakaway dunk, and the game ends, and you\u2019re champions. What do you recall as you were running off the floor? WU: I wasn\u2019t running anywhere. I was walking. I was as tired as I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I remember walking off the court and somebody grabbed and said \u2018no, you have to go this way.\u2019 I remember thinking \u2018everybody else went that way; why do I have to go this way?\u2019 \u2018Well, Mr. Pollin wants you to come this way.\u2019 We went up to another little room and that\u2019s when they had the trophy ceremony or something. I also remember walking off the court, and Motta runs over to me and says \u2018pick me up.\u2019 I remember saying \u2018you\u2019ve gotta be out of your mind. I can\u2019t pick me up.\u2019 Me: A lot of people in D.C. still remember that picture of you and Abe after the game . I know how close you were with him. I would imagine that you were probably happier for him than for yourself. WU: Absolutely. I didn\u2019t say what I wanted to say. I felt, you deserve this more than anybody. You not only went through the anguish of it, but, hell, you lost all the money. We still got paid. I really wanted to say something to him, and nothing came out. So I just gave him a hug. Most expensive hug he\u2019s ever had. Me: Have you kept in touch with the guys from that team? WU: Pretty much. Elvin and I have gotten along, in all honesty, better now than we ever did when we played together. I\u2019m very proud of our relationship. Dandridge, I see and talk to all the time. Phil (Chenier, who had his No. 45 jersey retired last Friday ), of course, I see and talk to all the time. Kevin Grevey. Mitch, I haven\u2019t talked to since I got out of the game. But I was glad to see all of those guys do well at some point.  Me: The 70s was the most democratic era in NBA history \u2014 seven teams won titles in those 10 years. But there was no truly dominant team. Do you feel like people remember that era? WU: Oh, see, I refuse to get into stuff like that. I had a bunch of guys, my era guys, that got pissed off when they were telling me something about the kid here with the Wizards now, John Wall. That type of stuff doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ve had people tell me \u2018somebody else deserved to be there more than you.\u2019 That\u2019s fine. I never put me there. I don\u2019t give into that. I can never get into stuff like that. It just depends on when you play. I see guys now and they\u2019re talking about how they\u2019re scoring 30 points, 40 points. And I say \u2018yeah, but you would have done it without any hands, \u2018cause I\u2019d have knocked them off.\u2019 https:\/\/twitter.com\/JJRedick\/status\/978060899683627008 \u2014 76ers guard and former Duke star J.J.

We know better than to make a judgment of a player based on the NCAAs. We are told every year that you must look at a Draft prospect\u2019s entire body of work \u2014 what they did during the whole season, or preceding seasons \u2014 and that any one game, for good or bad, can unfairly skew a player\u2019s reputation. Having acknowledged that, though, there is some value in seeing how players do in neutral sites against different types of competition, coaching, defenses, etc. After all, a lot of players who are likely to go in the Lottery were quickly eliminated in the first or second round. Staying power does count for something. So, in no particular order, here are some names that personnel types contacted this week nominated: F Mikal Bridges | 6-7 | Junior | Villanova G Jalen Brunson | 6-3 | Junior | Villanova G Jevon Carter | 6-2 | Senior | West Virginia F Caleb Martin | 6-7 | Junior | Nevada G Clayton Custer | 6-1 | Junior | Loyola F Rui Hachimura | 6-8 | Sophomore | Gonzaga G Tyus Battle | 6-6 | Sophomore | Syracuse G P.J. Washington | 6-7 | Freshman | Kentucky G Keenan Evans | 6-3 | Senior | Texas Tech G Malik Newman | 6-3 | Sophomore | Kansas F Mo Wagner | 6-11 | Junior | Michigan \u201cJalen Brunson has helped himself and Mo Wagner,\u201d a Western Conference executive said. \u201cBoth players were late first or early second-round picks and I\ufe0f think both should go in the first round. Jalen has been good but I think his leadership has been undervalued. Mo played poorly early in the year but has come on as of late.\u201d Newman, who was mentioned by more than one personnel man, scored 32 points with seven rebounds in Kansas\u2019 overtime victory over Duke in the Midwest Regional final Sunday. \u201cHe reminds me of Ray Allen in size, personality and shooting ability,\u201d another Western Conference executive said. \u201cHe\u2019s on the come so to speak. Value pick.\u201d A Western Conference scout cited Washington\u2019s improved scoring ability inside and how he rebounded in traffic for his higher marks. Another thought Brunson\u2019s performance during the tournament \u2014 he had 15 points, six rebounds and four assists in Sunday\u2019s East Regional final win over Texas Tech \u2014 solidified his likely first-round standing in the Draft. \u201cBrunson is the leader of the best team in the country,\u201d an Eastern Conference executive said. \u201cHe has shot the ball well all year and continued to do so through out the conference tournament and NCAA tourney. His vision and feel as a passer is second to none. He may have the highest basketball IQ in the country.\u201d The Eastern exec also singled out Evans \u2014 \u201cthe best player, on the best team, in maybe the best conference in America,\u201d he said. \u201cHe guided his team to wins with his ability to make others better while also scoring effectively.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

No, after you. From Ryan Marquez: Free agency is looming and I always hear about the Los Angeles Lakers aiming to go after LeBron James and Paul George. There were also trade rumors last season about George joining the Cavs. What I have noticed, though \u2014 and it is something that no one talks about \u2014 is that they play the same small forward position. I know LeBron can play all positions, but he really can\u2019t be your starting power forward, and we all know George didn\u2019t like the idea playing that spot , either, when he was in Indiana. I know we are in the position-less era of basketball (Thank you Warriors \u2014 my favorite team) but can anyone talk about how they\u2019d even fit in together? Your thoughts please. Great players figure it out, Ryan. If LeBron and PG-13 wound up on the same team, you could say one plays \u201cflurn\u201d and the other plays \u201csmall flurn.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t matter. They\u2019d find a way. As you mentioned, in this era, there are no positions. With so many teams going small a guy like LeBron is likely going to be bigger than any four he plays, anyway Al\u2019s sister would like a word. From Chris Larkin: We will disagree, strenuously, on Horford\u2019s impact on the Celtics. He is a huge reason for their outstanding team defense, just as he was with the Atlanta Hawks. His ability to defend in space and not be a liability if he has to switch on pick and rolls is incredibly important for Boston, as is his communication as the quarterback of the unit. I don\u2019t think fans understand how important talking is on defense. Steven Adams of the Oklahoma City Thunder has said often that among his biggest improvements as a defender is being able to better process not only what he sees, but what he knows the opposing offense is going to do next, and communicate that to his teammates in real time without hesitation. Horford doesn\u2019t hesitate. And, he\u2019s a timely shot blocker, in the tradition of guys like Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning, who knew that it\u2019s not how many shots you block and\/or intimidate, it\u2019s when you do them. Offensively, Horford\u2019s significant improvement behind the arc (career-high 42.9 percent on 3-pointers this season) keeps the floor spaced, which allows Irving (and, next season, Gordon Hayward) room to attack the paint. Horford\u2019s a great screen and roller as well , using both the 3-pointer and midrange pick-and-pop to great effect. He\u2019s a smart, tough, unsassuming teammate who is well worth the money he\u2019s getting. It is not a criticism of Randle to opine that he\u2019s not anywhere close to as good an all-around player as Horford. Scott and I continue chatting. From Scott Allen: Appreciate you continuing our discussion in a civilized manner, Scott. You are correct that driving a car and\/or getting Global Entry status are not rights enumerated in the Constitution. My analogy was not literal, of course, but you\u2019re correct on that. As for an outside entity to regulate fitness to write\/practice journalism, I\u2019d disagree. The First Amendment is about what is prohibited , not what is allowed: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d So, the government, by definition, can\u2019t establish oversight over speech or determine \u201cfitness\u201d to express oneself. Whereas, the Second Amendment reads: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Note the words \u201cwell regulated.\u201d The inference there being that the government does have standing to regulate the militia, such as it is. But it doesn\u2019t explicitly state the scope and\/or limits of that regulation. I would argue that keeping weapons of war such as the AR-15 out of the hands of civilians would fall under reasonable regulation. (But don\u2019t listen to me; maybe you\u2019ll listen to these veterans who state unequivocally that the AR-15 is, in no way, any different from the M-4s and M-16s they carried on battlefields, and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of civilians.) Taking these types of weapons off the streets does not limit anyone\u2019s right to bear arms; it limits people\u2019s rights to those types of arms. There\u2019s a reason you can\u2019t go into a store and buy a bomb; the government does not allow you to. You have to get permits to buy explosives, and state exactly what they are to be used for , and tell the government how you plan to store the explosives to ensure the safety of not only yourself, but the people that live and work near you. Federal law generally requires anyone \u201cwho imports, manufactures, deals, transports, ships, or receives explosives\u201d to obtain a federal explosives license or permit from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms . The person seeking the license or permit cannot have a criminal record, or have been institutionalized prior to making the application, or have received a dishonorable discharge from the military. (It took a while \u2014 too long, to me \u2014 but there also are now at least some limits on buying things like ammonium nitrate , which was used by Timothy McVeigh to build the explosives that took down the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City .) All I\u2019m asking for, Scott, is some common sense. Keep people who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy guns. Keep non-spouses who have have been convicted of domestic violence and\/or stalking their exes from being able to buy guns. Change the rules that allow private party dealers to sell weapons to anyone at gun shows without having to submit them to background checks, as dealers at federally licensed gun stores have to do. Create a board comprised of law enforcement members, the military, private gun owners and physicians to determine an agreed-upon definition of what a military grade weapon is, and ban the future manufacture\/current sale of same. No, this would not eliminate all mass killings. No, this would not stop all crime. No, this would not keep criminals from getting their hands on guns. But what would the harm be in trying something comprehensive, that isn\u2019t watered down by the National Rifle Association, to try and reduce the number of mass shootings, to take just some of the hundreds of millions of guns out of commission? Is \u201call guns, all the time\u201d making any of us feel safer? Has it actually made any of us safer?

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) James Harden (27 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 8.8 apg, .405 FG, .775 FT): Fourth straight season with at least 2,000 points scored. Dude gets buckets. LeBron James (34.8 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 11 apg, .627 FG, .784 FT): Well played, Akron . Well played. Kevin Durant (DNP: fractured rib) Anthony Davis (28.3 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 3.3 bpg, .597 FG, .844 FT): Diversity of his offensive game continues to grow. There\u2019s nowhere on the floor where he can\u2019t score now. Kyrie Irving (DNP: knee surgery) 342 \u2014 Number of shots Philly\u2019s J.J. Redick has to make \u2014 exactly \u2014 during his Sunday workout, just one of the many quirks the veteran guard has in his practice\/fitness regimen that has him playing some of the best basketball of his career this season for the Sixers, at age 33. 18 \u2014 Consecutive wins for the San Antonio Spurs over the Wizards in San Antonio, a streak dating back to Dec. 11, 1999 , when Washington won 99-89 behind 31 points from Mitch Richmond. Since then, the Spurs have beaten the Wizards by an average of 14.6 points during the streak; Washington has stayed within single digits of San Antonio just four times in those 18 games. 2,145 \u2014 Career 3-pointers for Minnesota\u2019s Jamal Crawford, who passed Paul Pierce for fifth place on the NBA\u2019s all-time 3-pointers list . Crawford now trails only Ray Allen (2,973), Reggie Miller (2,560), Jason Terry (2,274) and Kyle Korver (2,209). 1) B.b.b.b.b..ut\u2026three is more than two!!!!  2) This is probably the best compromise between one-and-done and MLB\u2019s rule requiring at least three years of college for players who don\u2019t apply for baseball\u2019s draft out of high school. 3) Kudos to Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, for speaking from the heart after protestors surrounded the entrances to Golden 1 Center last week, demonstrating after a 22-year-old African-American man was shot 20 times and killed by police in Sacramento March 18. The police were looking for a suspect breaking and entering nearby homes. The man, Stephon Clark, didn\u2019t have a weapon; he was holding a cell phone in his hand when police confronted him. The demonstrations kept fans who didn\u2019t arrive to the arena early from being able to get in the building. The Kings, in consultation with local authorities, decided it would be too dangerous to try and force the demonstration to move, and told fans who hadn\u2019t yet entered the arena to go home. Full refunds have been promised to those fans affected. But Ranadive spoke of community and using the team as a means to try and promote healing in the city, offering condolences to Clark\u2019s family. It was the move of someone seeking solutions rather than headlines. 3A) And bigger kudos to the Kings and Celtics players , who joined up to turn around a public service announcement in time for Sunday\u2019s game at Golden1 in which players on both teams made sure to say Stephon Clark\u2019s name , in keeping with the \u201cSay His Name\u201d\/\u201dSay Her Name\u201d movement, where the victims are not forgotten. 4) This is exactly right. There is a market and audience for well-written\/edited\/shot, knowledgeable stories about women\u2019s basketball. If you don\u2019t know anything about the history of the women\u2019s game or the people in the women\u2019s game or the players in the women\u2019s game, why would your stories about the women\u2019s game be of any use to anyone? But that is completely different from saying \u2018no one cares about the women\u2019s game.\u2019 Lots of people do. Many of them are talented journalists. Hire them. And let them work. In the digital age, there\u2019s no excuse for not allocating more resources to a sport that has a dedicated following. 5) Here is a great example of being able to get a lot of information and color out of someone who\u2019s done a million interviews with just a few, smart, thoughtful questions. 1) It is hard to quantify how shocking it is that the Spurs\u2019 laundry is out there, flapping in the breeze, like everyone else\u2019s unmentionables. This is an organization that, for 20 years, has been very comfortable with the Omerta concept. I have said it so many times I\u2019m tired of hearing myself say it: San Antonio has the same issues \u2014 money, shots, playing time \u2014 that everyone else has. It\u2019s just that, until now, you\u2019ve never heard them out in the open. That the Spurs and Kawhi Leonard are at an impasse is beyond obvious now; what the two sides wind up doing about it is the only thing that matters. 2) The best to Kyle Korver and his family , who are dealing with the tragic death of his younger brother Kirk, who passed away last week at 27. 3) Let us all hope that the first round of the playoffs is only lightly impacted by all the injuries to key players \u2013 Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart \u2014 who are up in the air at present for the postseason, now less than three weeks away. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

We should feel good about our ability to play through this stuff. \u201cWe also know that Steph has a history of coming back strong from injuries. So there\u2019s a good chance, if all goes well, he comes back during the playoffs at some point, we\u2019re at full steam. So that\u2019s the goal and that\u2019s our plan.\u201d Curry was officially ruled out for at least three weeks after the latest injury in a season he\u2019s suited up for just 51 of a possible 72 games. The best case scenario would have had Curry return just before the start of the first round on April 14 \u2014 22 days after he was injured. But with the Warriors facing a favorable matchup thanks to their likely second-place finish in the Western Conference, Kerr obviously isn\u2019t ready to take any chances with his second-leading scorer. Curry, however, isn\u2019t giving up on the possibility of a full postseason run. \u201cThere\u2019s a blessing in all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully they\u2019ll be a story in all of this and at the end of the day, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to get back on the court hopefully before our season is over with and do what I can to help our team win a championship, and that\u2019s really all I\u2019m focused on \u2026 \u201cHopefully I can get back as close to 100 percent before I get back so I\u2019m not limited out there.\u201d Curry\u2019s latest setback left the Warriors with all four of their All-Stars battling injuries down the stretch. Kerr expects Kevin Durant to return this week from fractured rib cartilage , while Draymond Green had been set to return Sunday from a pelvic contusion before being ruled out with flu-like symptoms . Klay Thompson is expected to miss several more games with a fractured right thumb . \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got to hold down the fort,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough. We\u2019re blessed with a great roster, a lot of depth and so let\u2019s get going. Let\u2019s play and let\u2019s compete and hold down the fort. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t come out and really play well down the stretch and be ready for the playoffs and then maybe we get Steph back and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report. * * *"},{"id":41212,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/shaquille-oneal-becomes-dominant-force-world-business-hbo-special","date":"2018-03-26","title":"HBO special to detail Shaquille O'Neal's rise to dominance in business world","content":" When it comes to leveraging a Hall of Fame playing career into a Hall of Fame post-playing career, few have done it the way Shaquille O\u2019Neal has since he hung up his size 22 sneakers. The NBA champion-turned TNT analyst\/entertainer\/entrepreneur has built a business empire, the foundation of which was constructed during his playing days. Now that he\u2019s on the other side, he\u2019s as omnipresent in the business world as he was on the court.

Shaq shares some of the details of his winning formula for transitioning from a dominant force on the court to a dominate force off the court with Bernard Goldberg on Tuesday\u2019s episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel ( 10:30 ET, HBO ).

He said, \u2018Shaq, I know you\u2019re full of yourself and I see you put a lot of time into this, but if you look at the climate of the NBA, big guys are not sellin\u2019. This\u2019ll never work.'\u201d What the professor didn\u2019t know is that Shaq would generate more revenue after his playing days than he did during his best seasons in uniform. When asked if he was making more money \u201cselling stuff, endorsing stuff and investing in stuff\u201d than he did when he was pulling down $30 million in one season playing in the NBA, Shaq said \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d But it wouldn\u2019t be Shaq if there wasn\u2019t a little comedy involved.

Spoelstra was back in Miami and not with the Heat for their game at Indiana, the first contest he missed in his 10-year tenure as head coach. Heat assistant coach Dan Craig took his spot for Miami\u2019s 113-107 overtime loss to the Pacers. \u201cSpo is right where he needs to be,\u201d Craig said.

The 47-year-old Spoelstra had not missed any of his previous 908 Heat games \u2013 795 regular season, 113 more in the playoffs \u2013 since becoming coach in 2008.

Even though Craig was calling the shots, Sunday\u2019s loss goes on Spoelstra\u2019s career record.

Fultz scoring off the dribble and creating his own shot haven\u2019t materialized.

Saturday night\u2019s 114-91 victory over the Pelicans was the Rockets\u2019 59th win of the season, a new franchise best. It tops the previous mark set by the 1993-94 squad that went on to win the franchise\u2019s first NBA championship. Kia Most Valuable Player candidate James Harden has led Houston to its most successful season yet since his arrival via trade in 2012. The All-Star guard is averaging 31.0 points per contest, second only to Moses Malone (31.1 ppg, 1981-82) in franchise history. His 11.2 assists per contest is already far and away the best such mark in Rockets annals. The achievement carries a tinge of deja vu for coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who steered the Phoenix Suns to a team record-tying 62 wins in the 2004-05 campaign.

He noted Benson\u2019s personal losses, saying he suffered the deaths of two previous wives, two children and three siblings. \u201cSome of the tensions of family life brought him disappointment and another loss,\u201d Aymond said. It was an apparent allusion to his falling out with daughter Renee, and her two children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc. They had been in line to take over the Benson business empire but Benson made it known in January 2015 that he intended for Gayle Benson to inherit complete control of the Saints and Pelicans. There followed an unsuccessful attempt by the estranged heirs to have Benson declared mentally incompetent in court. Benson was a successful automobile dealer when he bought the Saints in 1985. Under his ownership, the team achieved its first winning seasons and a Super Bowl championship in 2010 that buoyed the spirits of a city that was still struggling at the time to recover from Hurricane Katrina, which hit less than five years earlier. Benson bought the city\u2019s NBA franchise, the Pelicans, in 2012. In recent years, Benson was becoming known for his philanthropy as well as his business holdings and ownership of sports franchises. Beneficiaries included the Catholic churches and organizations and a $20 million donation to the Ochsner Health System for the Gayle and Tom Benson Cancer Center."},{"id":41202,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-larry-nance-tristan-thompson-rodney-hood-return","date":"2018-03-23","title":"Cavaliers get Larry Nance, Tristan Thompson and Rodney Hood back from injury","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Cavaliers are closer to being at full strength. Forwards Larry Nance Jr., Tristan Thompson, and Rodney Hood all returned from injuries on Friday night as Cleveland, which has been riddled with injuries all season, hosted the Phoenix Suns. Acting coach Larry Drew said none of the players will start and all will be on minutes\u2019 restrictions. Drew, who is filling in while coach Tyronn Lue is on leave to address his own health, plans to keep his starting lineup intact and ease the returning players into the rotation. LeBron James, Jose Calderon, George Hill, Jeff Green and Kevin Love were scheduled to started against Phoenix, which has lost nine in a row. Drew said he and Lue will talk again Saturday about lineup changes for the upcoming trip to Brooklyn, Miami and Charlotte. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to disrupt the starting five that we have out there right now and those guys will be playing limited minutes, so I wanted to get them slowly back and acclimated to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Drew said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that there could be some early substitutions to get the guys in there. I\u2019m not ruling that out, but right now I just kind of want to stay with the flow, stay with what we\u2019ve done the last couple of ballgames and then we\u2019ll probably after tonight we\u2019ll see as far as where we stand as far as starters are concerned.\u201d Thompson missed nine games with a sprained right ankle, Nance Jr. was out four with a hamstring issue and Hood was out the past three games with a bad back. Drew said he did not know if Lue will accompany the team on its trip. But while the Cavs are healthier than they\u2019ve been in weeks, the team is still missing Kyle Korver, who is with his family in Iowa following the death of his brother, and rookie Cedi Osman, who is sidelined with a left hip flexor strain."},{"id":41223,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/despite-loss-season-michael-porter-ready-deliver-next-level","date":"2018-03-23","title":"After injury-shortened season at Missouri, Michael Porter ready to showcase his skills","content":" Anyone who opines that Missouri freshman Michael Porter is soft or questioned his decision to return for postseason play after undergoing back surgery and missing all but two minutes of the regular season should have been in the Tigers\u2019 locker room after their first-round NCAA Tournament loss to Florida State last Friday. The 6-foot-10 Porter was surrounded by media as he tried to explain his emotions after a season that was mostly stolen from him had ended for good. He did everything he could to prevent that from happening, even playing at what he estimated was 65 or 70 percent of his capabilities. His doctor assured Porter he couldn\u2019t do any more damage to his back, so he gamely gave it a go, for his teammates \u2014 which included younger brother Jontay. Though he was far from in game shape and admitted to being \u201cgassed\u201d during the 28 minutes he was on the floor, he managed to rack up 16 points and 10 rebounds. Was his shot selection always prudent? Is any freshman\u2019s shot selection always prudent? Was he strong enough to battle with the Seminoles humongous frontcourt players or quick enough to elude their pesky guards? Not yet. Was his defense suspect? Of course. There are two ways of looking at what Porter attempted to do, as Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports learned when he polled NBA scouts . One, it was an effort in futility that could only have damaged his NBA Draft stock. Two, he proved his mettle by playing hurt, which every NBA player does, probably a lot more than the press and public knows, during the course of a career. Back to that locker room. Porter was devastated by the loss, took it personally, as though he, in his diminished capacity, could have done much to prevent it. \u201cI can honestly say, during the time I was out there, I played as hard as I could,\u201d Porter said. Porter was noble to shoulder some of the blame, but the truth is Missouri was just lucky to have gotten to the NCAAs. During the season, the Tigers lost three players \u2014 two of whom transferred \u2014 who played the point, forcing coach Cuonzo Martin to promote previously seldom-used reserves to the starting job, or even resort to using shooting guard Kassius Robertson, who had earned first-team All-Southeastern Conference honors after averaging 16.3 points and shooting 43.2 percent from 3-point range. Running offense wasn\u2019t the job he expected to do at Mizzou. Given that loss of manpower at point guard, Porter\u2019s loss was felt even more. Not that Porter is the second-coming of Ben Simmons, but he showed in one game in the SEC Tournament and another in the NCAAs that he had the ability to defensive rebound and dribble the length of the court, to facilitate offense with his passing, and to be a steadying presence to his teammates, even at his young age. Had he been available all season, maybe Porter could have filled in at the point. But no one will ever know how Porter\u2019s only season as a college basketball player would have turned out. Those who know him best can only speculate. Michael Porter, Sr., father of Michael and Jontay and an assistant coach on Martin\u2019s staff, has never been concerned about his oldest son\u2019s NBA future. He espouses more of a live-in-the-moment philosophy, so he was fine with Michael, Jr. coming back for postseason play, regardless of whether he was at full strength. \u201cI could care less about next-level stuff,\u201d Porter, Sr., said. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s not promised. All we\u2019ve got is today, and I wanted him to make the most of today. So, whatever he decided to do, I was comfortable with.\u201d Porter, Sr. thought his son would have benefitted more from having been able to play an entire season than Missouri would have. \u201cHe would have added a lot to this team,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a healthy Michael would have benefitted from being with this bunch during the season, more than vice versa. Jontay\u2019s a different player now from having gone through 30 games. And if Michael had had the opportunity to go through 30-31 games, I think he would have gained a lot.\u201d Jontay Porter, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound stretch four who has shown up as a first-round pick in mock drafts, echoed his father\u2019s thoughts. He wound up averaging 9.9 points, fourth on the team, led the Tigers in rebounding (6.8 rpg) and blocked shots (55) and shot a solid 36.4 percent from 3 (40 of 110). Jontay Porter wishes the season had turned out differently; he reclassified in high school to be able to graduate a year early and have the chance to play with Michael, Jr. But he didn\u2019t want to speculate about what could have been. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of all theoretical, and I don\u2019t like to look at what ifs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Michael is still the same special player he was before the surgery. And I think he would have still done the same special things he was capable of doing if he hadn\u2019t been injured. He\u2019s the best player on our team, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret.\u201d NBA teams will get to see how special Porter is during the run-up to the draft, when he interviews and works out. Porter\u2019s doctor has told him that his mobility will be incrementally better a month from now, and better still a month after that. Despite the way his season turned out. Michael Porter doesn\u2019t look back with regret. \u201cIt killed me at the time, but I look at it as a blessing in disguise,\u201d Porter said. \u201cNow my body\u2019s out of that pain that I was in for a couple of years. It\u2019s hard, but I see the potential in me now, not having that pain. I know I\u2019m going to be good. I can\u2019t wait to see myself a couple of months from now.\u201d Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Irving has been out of the Celtics\u2019 lineup since first injuring the knee in a March 11 loss to the Indiana Pacers . There is no timetable for Irving\u2019s return from the injury, which the team says will become more clear after the procedure is completed . Irving had sought a second opinion on his injury after not being pleased with the lack of progress in his recovery from the injury, as Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports first reported earlier this week . He has missed four straight games, including Tuesday\u2019s 100-99 comeback win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Irving first acknowledged soreness in the knee after a loss to the Houston Rockets earlier this month.  Celtics coach Brad Stevens was asked before Boston\u2019s game in Portland on Friday night the ramifications of Irving\u2019s surgery. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have it tomorrow and we\u2019ll know more about timelines after that.\u201d The knee is the same one that Irving injured in the 2015 NBA finals that required surgery. After leaving that loss to the Pacers on March 11, Irving hinted at taking an extended period of rest for the balky knee . Irving said the knee started bothering him during a March 3 showdown with the Houston Rockets, a game the Celtics lost 123-120 . The former No. 1 overall pick sat out a 105-89 win against the Chicago Bulls on March 5 to rest that same knee, which he broke during Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He did return, however, to play in Boston\u2019s victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves on March 8. Irving is averaging 24.7 points, 5.2 assists and 3.8 rebounds per contest while shooting 49.1 percent from the field and 40.8 percent on 3-pointers. Stevens said the team will focus on its strengths in light on the injuries. \u201cDo what you do best. That\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got something they do well otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be in the NBA. Don\u2019t try to be something you\u2019re not, don\u2019t try to make up for Kyrie\u2019s absence, or Smart\u2019s absence, or Tyson\u2019s absence by trying to do what they do. Just do you and just be good at it, be reliable at it. That\u2019s all we\u2019re going to ask.\u201d Stevens said he had not had a lot of discussion with the front office about adding another player. \u201cI think that there is the possibility of applying for an exception again because of all the knee injuries and the length of injuries. I don\u2019t know where we are with that, and I haven\u2019t talked to them about any particulars. He said if the Celtics added anyone it would be to give the team perimeter depth.

Giannis Antetokounmpo missed Friday\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls, the team announced, due to the right ankle sprain he suffered on Wednesday night against the LA Clippers . According to ESPN\u2019s Nick Friedell, Antetokounmpo did not travel with the team to Chicago and also had an MRI on his ankle recently. Friedell reports that Bucks interim coach Joe Prunty didn\u2019t sound too worried that his All-Star forward will miss a lot of time. But Prunty was also not sure when Antetokoumpo would return to the lineup. Antetokounmpo was injured in the second quarter against the LA Clippers. He appeared to get hurt when he tripped over teammate Shabazz Muhammad under Milwaukee\u2019s basket. He stayed in the game for a brief period, but hobbled around the court while grimacing. He went to the locker room with about four minutes remaining in the second quarter and did not return. Forward Jabari Parker replaced Antetokounmpo in the starting line-up.

Those two beauties only had to navigate their planes, trains and automobiles one way, New York to Chicago, for the start of a Thanksgiving weekend. * Tonight on NBA TV:  Nuggets vs. Wizards (7 ET) * Playoff Picture:  Nuggets currently ninth in West The Nuggets are in the midst of something entirely more grueling. In one of the most challenging schedule quirks in recent NBA memory, Denver is enduring a seven-game, 15-day road trip in what typically is referred to as the \u201chome\u201d stretch of the season. With their playoff hopes crammed into the overhead bins above their seats. The Nuggets left Denver at 2 p.m. MT on Friday, March 16 bound for Memphis. They\u2019ll get back, barring any mechanical or weather delays, on Friday, March 30, about an hour before midnight after playing that evening in Oklahoma City. In between, they\u2019ll have logged enough miles and crossed enough time zones to qualify for their unofficial Phish roadie licenses. It\u2019s an apt analogy because the Nuggets at the moment are less an NBA team than a rock band or pop act, at risk of being strung out from the cities strung together on their behalf by the schedule-crafting computers in New York City. It\u2019s a crazy quilt of destinations \u2013 Memphis, Miami, Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, Toronto, Oklahoma City \u2013 with a dip into and out of Canada. Their watches and phones are like a dieting foodie\u2019s bathroom scale, losing or gaining the same hour four or five times. Word is, the team\u2019s management reached out to NBA HQ for some tweaks or adjustments, but got back only slight alterations to the schedule of 82 games, none for this particular trip. What did Nuggets coach Mike Malone think when he first saw this booby trap looming so late in the regular season? \u201c \u2018Who\u2019d we [tick] off?\u2019\u201d Malone said in Chicago Wednesday. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been in the league a long time and to have a 15-day, seven-game road trip this late in the season, and going from Miami to Chicago to Toronto to Philly to D.C. to OKC and back, is a lot.\u201d Excuse Malone for not having all the cities or the right order. He didn\u2019t have the Nuggets\u2019 four-page itinerary for this trek in front of him. In addition to the flight times and hotels, it lists 14 breakfast or brunch meetings \u2013 at least this is no Donner party \u2013 five practices, six shootarounds and of course seven games. With two buses to and from every arena and airport. In air miles, Denver will travel approximately 5,609. That\u2019s the equivalent of flying twice across the United States \u2013 New York to Los Angeles and back \u2013 with a bonus flight from L.A. to Denver. \u201cYou have to get past it,\u2019\u2019 Malone said. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever happy with their schedule. We have to embrace it and make the most of it. \u201cBut all I know, for us, we\u2019ve had a four-game road trip, a six-game road trip and a seven-game road trip. And there are two teams in our division whose longest road trips are three games. There is no competitive balance to that, in my opinion.\u201d It galls some in the Nuggets\u2019 traveling party that the Minnesota Timberwolves and the OKC Thunder have not and will not take to the road for more than three consecutive games all season. Denver already had trips of four and six games, going a combined 4-6. It is 1-2 so far on this one, with a humiliating loss at Memphis, a double-overtime setback at Miami and a cruise past the Bulls Wednesday. The Nuggets are trying not think too much about their home Pepsi Center, which hasn\u2019t been taken over by the Grammys, an NCAA regional, a rodeo or any other event overstaying its welcome. This is simply how the schedule broke. After facing the Wizards Friday night at Capital One Arena, the Nuggets hit the hurry-up-and-wait portion of the trip. They don\u2019t play again until Monday night at Philadelphia, but that\u2019s the front end of a back-to-back that has them rushing to face the Raptors Tuesday. Then they have until Friday to get to OKC and deal with the Thunder. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the NBA changing what they want to do with the schedule,\u201d said veteran forward Richard Jefferson, who in 16 previous NBA seasons couldn\u2019t recall taking such a trip. \u201cSo instead of playing four games in five nights, you\u2019re playing four games over 10 nights. The schedule gets spaced out completely. We were home for three weeks. Now we\u2019re on the road for two.\u201d Jefferson said this travel pace is better than what teams faced before on multi-game trips. \u201cYou\u2019re staying the night in a lot of cities,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re able to get more rest, you\u2019re able to get better sleep.\u201d The touring version of the Nuggets haven\u2019t gotten nearly the same reviews this season as the home show. Denver is 27-10 at the Pepsi Center, flexing its high-altitude advantage in the building where it enjoyed a six-game homestand early in the schedule and then played 14 of 19 from Dec. 30 to Feb. 5. Elsewhere, however, the Nuggets are just 12-23. They score nearly five points fewer per game than at home (107.3 to 112.2) and give up nearly five more (110.8 to 106.1) for a net swing in their point differential of minus-9.6. In all, they shoot worse, rebound less, pass the ball less adeptly, shoot fewer free throws and foul more when working out of a suitcase. As unfair as this schedule grind might appear, the Nuggets had played five more games at home than on the road when this trip began. But they hadn\u2019t used that for any cushion. They woke up Friday in ninth place in the West, same spot they were in before this trip began. At 39-33, they were two games worse than Minnesota and Utah (both 41-31) for the final playoff spot. The Clippers, at 38-33, were breathing down the Nuggets\u2019 necks a half-game back. From this point, six of Denver\u2019s final 10 games are on the road, including the four left on this trip. Then, after a pair at home against East playoff teams Milwaukee and Indiana next weekend, the Nuggets close against serious rivals: the Timberwolves, the Clippers, the Trail Blazers and the Wolves again.  Assuming there still is grist for those rivalries by then. \u201cWith [10] games to go, not only is every game important but every quarter, every possession,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThe magnitude of it all is huge right now and our players understand, there are no more wasted opportunities. If we\u2019re going to lose, make it a loss like we had in Miami, where we leave everything on the floor. It can\u2019t be a loss where you\u2019re kicking yourself after the game saying, \u2018We should have or could have played harder.\u2019 That can never be in the discussion right now.\u201d Coaches and players have unsheathed all their best coping techniques for what must not become a death march. Malone said having the team stay over a night in Miami was a nod to bonding and stress-relief, same as sharing a team dinner or heading off to a movie as a group. Forward Wilson Chandler stressed rest and nutrition. \u201cJust try to get as much rest as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSleep on the plane, sleep on the bus. Try not to stay up too late. Make sure you get enough calories, and eating healthy too.\u201d Big man Nikola Jokic rattled off ways to stay mentally and physically sharp. \u201cDo the small things. Do the treatments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s 40 minutes, 30 minutes, do something to keep your body fresh. Go to the gym, take some shots maybe. Or just keep a kind of normal routine going.\u201d Veteran Paul Millsap\u2019s sage advice? \u201c \u2018Survive.\u2019 That\u2019s my tip,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cGet out there and do the best you can. I think that\u2019s been our team. We\u2019ve had guys out, I\u2019ve been out [44 games with a wrist injury]. So we\u2019ve had to survive and do the best we can. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been in the playoffs for a while. So I think it\u2019s a good test for us. Sink or swim. You\u2019ve got to earn your right to get into the playoffs. I think we\u2019re earnin\u2019 our right.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He spoke glowingly of his family, friends, teammates and the franchise that helped him grow from a teen phenom after one season the University of Texas into a player recognized as the NBA\u2019s best for his performance during that 2013-14 season. The expectation was that it could very well be the first of several such speeches for a four-time scoring champion and Olympic gold medal-winning wunderkind, a player thought by many destined to be the heir apparent to LeBron James as the face of the league. But in a league where the narratives change with the twist of a knee or the turn of an ankle, expectations and reality don\u2019t always meet. Sure, Durant is still widely considered the best player in basketball not named James. And he\u2019s finally won the championship that eluded him in Oklahoma City, claiming his first last summer with the Golden State Warriors , capping the occasion with a Finals MVP as he out dueled James in an epic showdown in The Finals. Those tear-jerking Kia MVP speeches, though, have not been a part of the program for Durant and who knows if they will be in the future. It\u2019s not that he hasn\u2019t played at a MVP level \u2014 he has. But his narrative has changed dramatically, with his move from the Thunder to the Warriors in free agency before last season costing him dearly. (A Kia MVP joining forces with a back-to-back Kia MVP in Stephen Curry would certainly cost both of them on many ballots. It surely did when Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant, each one-time MVP winners, shared the court during their overlapping primes with the Los Angeles Lakers.) And for the second straight season, an injury has interrupted any chance Durant had a of making a late-season push for his second Kia MVP award. Last season, it was Zaza Pachulia falling into Durant\u2019s knee two minutes into a Feb. 28 game in Washington. That injury cost him the next 19 games and five critical weeks of action. A fractured rib revealed six days ago will cost Durant two weeks and possibly more. James Harden\u2019s lead in this season\u2019s MVP chase is significant. He\u2019s No. 1 and has been most of this season on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, making it nearly impossible for Durant, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeMar DeRozan, Damian Lillard, reigning Kia MVP Russell Westbrook or any other contender to close the gap on him. Durant is expected back for the postseason and the Warriors, who are dealing with injuries to all four of their All-Stars (Durant, Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green), will be ready to defend their title. The only available MVP hardware, though, will come in The Finals \u2026 provided Durant and the Warriors can get back there. Given the way expectations and reality often miss each other, there are no guarantees. Durant knows that better than most. * * * The top five in the Week 23 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.2 points, 8.7 assists, 5.2 rebounds Harden punctuates his MVP worthiness with every outing for the league-leading Rockets. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a game against a lottery-bound team or a streaking Portland Trail Blazers, whose 13-game win streak Harden helped the Rockets snap with a 42-point, seven-assist, six-rebound performance . If there was any doubts about Harden\u2019s vice grip on the top spot on this list, they should vanish by now. The Rockets continue to draft off of the exceptional play of their leader and only All-Star, so much so that Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni is convinced Harden is the \u201cbest offensive player\u201d he has ever seen. That\u2019s a huge statement, given D\u2019Antoni\u2019s experience as both a player and coach. And it\u2019s not worth the time some of us will waste debating that claim, since D\u2019Antoni\u2019s just expressing his own opinion on the matter. But it\u2019s worth noting that Harden does posses basically every tool necessary to dominate the competition in this 3-point shooting era. He can get a shot however and whenever he pleases, can work from distance and everywhere else on the floor, creates for others and is a knockdown free throw shooter as well. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.4 points, 9.1 assists, 8.6 rebounds Another day, another virtuoso performance from the man who insists his game is aging like fine wine. It\u2019s hard to argue with the 33-year-old mega-star when he shows out the way he did in Wednesday\u2019s showdown win over the East-leading Toronto Raptors. His 35-point, 17-assist, seven-rebound, zero-turnover effort was his fifth game this season with 15 or more assists and marked the first time since turnovers became an official stat in the 1977-78 season that a player finished a game with 35 or more points, 15 or more assists and no turnovers. For all the drama the Cavaliers have had to deal with this season \u2014 the latest being coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s indefinite leave for health reasons \u2014 LeBron has been an absolute force of nature. He\u2019s averaging a triple-double (31.5 points, 10.3 rebounds, 10.1 assists) in his last 10 games and is on pace to play all 82 games for the first time in his career \u2014 he played 80 in his second season (2004-05) and 81 in his sixth season (2008-09). The win over the Raptors should also serve as a signal to the rest of the Eastern Conference that the the Cavaliers will not surrender their crown without a fight, a and furious one from their leader. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  23.6 points, 5.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds Even with a four-game lead over Boston in the Eastern Conference standings, DeRozan and the Raptors are still on the hunt for respect. Yes, respect, from the rest of the league, from the officials ( see DeRozan\u2019s rant after Sunday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City ) and especially from their foil in Cleveland. Taking on another loss to the Cavaliers, in a playoff atmosphere at Quicken Loans Arena, doesn\u2019t help the cause. The Raptors have been the far better team throughout the course of this regular season, but the uneasy feelings Raptors fans have when they see LeBron James when it matters most remain. The upside for the Raptors is that they won\u2019t go into the final weeks of this regular season and the playoffs with any sense of entitlement. DeRozan and Kyle Lowry know they have to continue grinding to reach their team goals this season, same goes for coach Dwane Casey and the rest of the Raptors\u2019 supporting cast. Wednesday\u2019s showdown with the Cavaliers highlighted both sides of the Raptors\u2019 situation. They were good enough in the first half to pile up 79 points against LeBron\u2019s crew, but couldn\u2019t finish the deal in the second half, when the Cavaliers cranked up their energy and LeBron dominated them with his scoring and playmaking. The Raptors will need DeRozan to serve as their closer if they meet in the postseason. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  28.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 2.4 blocks A solid argument could be made for Davis, and not LeBron James, as the most dynamic two-way player in the game today. The league-leader in blocks (2.4 bpg), Davis is also providing the fuel that has powered the Pelicans\u2019 post All-Star break run \u2014 he\u2019s averaging 31.0 points, 12.7 rebounds and 3.6 blocks since the All-Star break. That stretch includes a 45-point, 17-rebound, five-block and five-steal performance in a Feb. 23 win over Miami, 53 points, 18 rebounds and five blocks in a Feb. 26 win over Phoenix, 41 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks in a March 6 win over the LA Clippers and a 25-point, 11-rebound and 10-block triple-double in a March 11 loss to Utah. The most impressive numbers during this run, however, might be the Pelicans\u2019 12-4 mark that propelled them from the fringe of the Western Conference playoff picture into the mix for a top four seed and potential home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. That 10-game win streak, that began three games before the All-Star break and shortly after DeMarcus Cousins was lost for the season with an Achilles injury, is the best run of that sort during the Davis era in New Orleans. If Davis keeps it up, the Pelicans might be ready to play the role of spoiler in the postseason. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  26.8 points, 6.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds After struggling in the Trail Blazers\u2019 loss to Houston that snapped their 13-game win streak, Lillard will have a chance to get back on track with the Boston Celtics visiting the Moda Center tonight ( 10 ET, NBA TV ). He shot just 5-for-17 from the floor (0-for-7 from deep) against the Rockets and didn\u2019t fare much better on the defensive end when matched up against James Harden. In fact, Lillard has been struggling with his shot lately (just .364 in his last five games and .289 on 3-pointers). But he\u2019s been spectacular from the free throw line, knocking down 46 of his 47 attempts during that same five-game stretch, including 37 straight. Portland\u2019s success with Lillard trying to shake out of his mini-shooting slump is a testament to the work the entire group has done during their late-season surge. And it suggests that they could be primed for more fireworks when Lillard gets back to normal. With road games in Oklahoma City (Sunday) and New Orleans (Tuesday) on the horizon and all three teams jockeying for position in the Western Conference playoff chase, you can bet Lillard will be locked in for the challenges ahead. The next five: 6. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 7. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 8. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 9. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 10. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers And five more \u2026: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks; Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves An inside look at Dwight Howard from an Eastern Conference executive: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to wrap my head around where Dwight is right now in his career, and really how he got here. The perception of who he is as a player and the player you see on the floor is very different. I mean, a 30-30 games at this stage of his career is pretty damn impressive, even if you don\u2019t believe in him the way we all did when he was younger. He\u2019s always been productive, a literal walking double-double, and that goes for everywhere he\u2019s been. Let\u2019s be clear about that. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever been a guy that didn\u2019t go out there and do what he\u2019s supposed to do. But he didn\u2019t play with the same fire or bounce once he soured on his situation with the Lakers or Rockets and even late in his one season with the Hawks. There\u2019s a difference in performance when he\u2019s engaged, I mean really engaged and believing in what the organization has going on. But when something is off, you can see it. You can read it in his body language. You can\u2019t ignore him and what he brings to your team. \u201cYou have to make sure he\u2019s involved in the offense, even if he\u2019s not the No. 1 option. And I think that was the major disconnect in Houston. Cliff [Hornets coach Steve Clifford] was the ideal coach to help him get back to his comfort zone because of their history together from earlier in Dwight\u2019s career. There\u2019s a trust level that has to be there if you\u2019re going to get him to empty his tank every night. And to Dwight\u2019s credit, he\u2019s done that this season with the Hornets. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s moving back to the top of the list for big men in our league, not at all. Those days are over, and that has as much to do with the evolution of the game during his career as it does with the offensive limitations that he was never able to smooth out. I remember laughing when I heard all the chatter about him stretching out as a 3-point shooter in [Mike Budenholzer\u2019s system] in Atlanta. That was never going to work. He always seemed like an odd fit there, but given where he was in his career and how desperate the Hawks were to shake things up, you can understand why both sides decided to take the risk. He\u2019s in a much better space now, a system much more conducive to his game and what he can still do to help a team out.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Fans in cities across the NBA landscape have either put up or are in the process of putting up billboards to try and sway the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 superstar to sign with their team this summer. Days ago, Portland was the latest to get into the mix after fans surpassed the amount needed to put up a billboard in that city.  According to Cleveland.com\u2019s Jennifer Conn, Akron has gotten into the mix as well. Realtor Alison McIntyre Baranek put up the signs in Akron, which is, of course, the hometown and birthplace of James.   Here\u2019s more from Baranek on why she felt the need to put the billboards up:    Similar types of billboards have been launched by other fans, first by a remodeling company in Philadelphia (which put the billboards installed in Cleveland) and also by an attorney in Los Angeles (who had them put up in L.A.) . James can become a free agent this summer and many fan bases around the NBA are hoping their team takes a shot at signing him.  The minds behind \u2018Trillblazin\u2019 , a Trail Blazers-themed social media presence, started a Go Fund Me campaign to raise $2000 for a LeBron billboard in the city . According to The Oregonian \u2018s Tim Brown, the group quickly surpassed that goal after getting donations from around the country, as well as from local business and celebrities who hail from Portland (such as comedian Ian Karmel and the rock band Portugal The Man).  Personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani put up four billboards around Los Angeles to try and woo James, who can enter free agency this summer . ESPN.com reported the Philadelphia billboards were leased by Power Home Remodeling, a company based in Chester, Pennsylvania. The company\u2019s CEO says the goal is to bring James, a three-time NBA champion, to Philadelphia because \u201cwe think the best athletes should want to play here.\u201d  When the billboards in Philadelphia were erected, James couldn\u2019t help but be flattered by them.  \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not. Not a distraction,\u201d James told reporters on Feb. 27 . \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering \u2014 but people in their respective city want me to play for them. That\u2019s cool I think. That\u2019s dope.\u201d  The 33-year-old James can opt out of his contract this summer with the Cavaliers. He\u2019s said in the past that he would like to end his career with Cleveland, but because he hasn\u2019t given the team a long-term commitment, there is constant speculation that he may leave his home state a second time.  James famously announced he was taking his \u201ctalents to South Beach\u201d and signed with the Miami Heat in 2010. He won two NBA titles in four years with the Heat before returning to Cleveland in 2014  Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Guard Stephen Curry, who has been out since March 8 with a sprained ankle, has been officially cleared to play tonight. Curry went through the team\u2019s shootaround today, a day after logging his second straight practice with the team. Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle has more what\u2019s next for Curry tonight against the Hawks : While Curry is seemingly set to return, Kevin Durant (fractured rib cartilage), Klay Thompson (fractured right thumb) and Draymond Green (pelvic contusion) are out tonight. Thompson and Durant participated in non-contact work yesterday, Letourneau reports, but they are probably at least a week away from returning. Curry has been out since March 8, which is when he sprained his right ankle against the San Antonio Spurs. He was cleared by the team to practice on Tuesday and did exactly that on Wednesday. Golden State trails the Houston Rockets by 4 1\/2 games for the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference. The Warriors are a sparkling 40-10 with Curry this season, and would likely need him if they have any hope of catching the Rockets out West. Golden State has been the top team in its conference in each of the last three seasons. This season, Curry is averaging 26.3 points, 6.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game for the Warriors (53-18).

For the second straight season, the Blazers are the most improved team after the All-Star break. Last year, spurred by the acquisition of Jusuf Nurkic at the trade deadline, the Blazers were 7.8 points per 100 possessions better after the break (plus-5.3) than they were before it (minus-2.5) . This year, without a rotation-altering trade, the Blazers have been 9.5 points per 100 possessions better since the break (plus-10.0) than they were before it (plus-0.4). Their 13-game winning streak (which started with their last game before All-Star weekend) came to an end at the hands of James Harden and the Houston Rockets on Tuesday, but prior to that, they were the only undefeated team (12-0) since the break, climbing from seventh place in the West at the break to third place (with a relatively comfortable three-game lead in the loss column over the teams behind them) going into Thursday\u2019s games. Improvement has come on both ends of the floor. The Blazers have been 5.5 points per 100 possessions better offensively and 4.0 points per 100 possessions better defensively since the break. With the league average seeing an increase of 1.3 per 100, that\u2019s about even improvement on both ends of the floor. * Blogtable:  What makes these Blazers stand out? On offense, the Blazers have increased their 3-point rate (3PA\/FGA) from 31 percent before the All-Star break to 35 percent since, but have seen just a small jump in effective field goal percentage. Improvement has come more from taking better care of the ball and getting to the line more often. Over the last 16 games, Damian Lillard has averaged 9.2 points at the free throw line , 3.4 more than he averaged prior to that ( 5.8 ). Lillard has also seen a drop in turnover ratio, from 9.8 per 100 possessions before the break to 7.8 since . That 7.8 is the second lowest (higher than that of only LaMarcus Aldridge) among 14 players with a usage rate of greater than 30 percent since the break . On defense, rebounding has been key. After allowing 12.2 second chance points per game before the break , the Blazers have allowed just 9.5 ( second fewest in the league ) since. They continue to lead the league in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area and have been at their best defensively with Jusuf Nurkic on the floor . The defensive improvement may be more impressive, given that six of the Blazers\u2019 13 post-break games have been against the league\u2019s top-10 offenses , though that includes games against Minnesota without Jimmy Butler and Golden State without Stephen Curry. It should also be noted that nine of the 13 games have been at home. Of course, the Blazers have been better defensively on the road (103.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) than they\u2019ve been at home (104.6) this season. We\u2019ll see how those numbers (and their post-break improvement) hold up when they play seven of nine on the road after hosting the Boston Celtics on Friday ( 10 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). Some teams might want to be playing their best going into the playoffs. But playing better late in the season doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything. In fact, playoff team stats (offensive and defensive efficiency) more strongly correlate with pre-All-Star numbers than with post-All-Star numbers. Over the last 10 full seasons (going back to 2007-08 and skipping 2011-12), the 20 playoff teams that have seen the biggest increase in NetRtg (point differential per 100 possessions) from before the break to after the break have been more likely to underachieve in the playoffs (losing a series in which they had home-court advantage) than overachieve (winning a series they started on the road).  The playoff team of the last 20 years that saw the biggest improvement was the 2009-10 Phoenix Suns, who were 8.2 points per 100 possessions better after the break (plus-11.2) than they were before it (plus-2.9) . They reached the conference finals as the 3 seed in the West, but did so with home-court advantage in each of the first two rounds (because the seventh-seeded Spurs beat the second-seeded Mavs in the first round). Four of those 20 most improved teams have lost in the first round with home-court advantage, while the 2010-11 Chicago Bulls (4.5 points per 100 possessions better after the break) lost in the conference finals as the No. 1 seed. The overachievers? The 2008-09 Houston Rockets (5.6 points per 100 possessions better after the break) and 2013-14 Washington Wizards (4.8 better) won first-round series as No. 5 seeds without home-court advantage. And finally, the 2014-15 Cleveland Cavaliers (who were 4.8 points per possessions better after the break) reached The Finals as a No. 2 seed. With that in mind, here are the teams that have been most improved on either end of the floor since the All-Star break this season. 1. Miami Heat Like the Blazers, the Heat are doing this for the second year in a row. When they went from 11-30 in their first 41 games to 30-11 in their last 41 games last season, it was on offense where they really turned things around . Last year\u2019s turnaround came with increases in both 3-point percentage and 3-point volume (3PA\/FGA). This year, the Heat have shot better from beyond the arc since the break, but they\u2019ve actually taken a lower percentage of their shots from 3-point range than they did prior, so their jump in effective field goal percentage isn\u2019t huge. They have gone from the bottom 10 to the top 10 in both offensive rebounding percentage and turnover rate. Hassan Whiteside has grabbed 28 offensive boards in just eight post-break games, though he hasn\u2019t seen a big increase in offensive rebounding percentage since the break . The team increase has been more about six different guys grabbing at least 13 offensive boards over the 14 games. On the turnover front, James Johnson has seen a big drop in his individual rate, from 13.7 turnovers per 100 possessions before the break to just 7.3 since the break . Goran Dragic has also seen seen a reduction . The drop in turnovers, along with more second chances and an increase in pace, as provided the Heat with almost six additional shots per 48 minutes . The Heat\u2019s post-break offense has been at its best ( more than 123 points scored per 100 possessions ) with Kelly Olynyk on the floor. Both Olynyk (60.7 percent) and James Johnson (60.6 percent) rank in the top 20 in post-break effective field goal percentage among 157 players who have taken at least 100 shots since the break . Tyler Johnson, meanwhile, has seen an effective field goal percentage jump from 50 percent before the break to 58 percent since the break . The Heat have played a fairly average post-break schedule in regard to opposing defenses. They\u2019ve picked on some bad ones (scoring 128 points per 100 possessions in three games against the Suns, Nuggets and Knicks) and have played ugly against some good ones (like those of the Sixers and Blazers), but have been strong against the defenses in the middle of the pack. Going forward, they\u2019ll play just three of their 10 remaining games against top-10 defenses. Two of those are against the eighth-ranked Thunder, and one of those is Friday. Six of their other seven games are against bottom-10 defenses. 2. L.A. Lakers Rookies and second year players have accounted for 45 percent of the Lakers\u2019 minutes this season. That\u2019s the third highest rate in the league and the highest among teams that aren\u2019t at least 23 games under .500. So, in-season improvement both critical and somewhat expected. Of course, a vet has been a big part of the Lakers\u2019 offensive improvement. Brook Lopez has seen the second biggest increase in effective field goal percentage (behind that of Wilson Chandler) among players who took at least 300 shots before the break and have taken at least 100 since the break (see table below).  For Lopez, as well as the team as a whole, it\u2019s been about the three ball, both in regard to percentage and volume. Before the break, the Lakers ranked 29th in 3-point percentage and 22nd in the percentage of their shots that were threes . Since the break: fifth and fourth . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (46.3 percent) ranks seventh in post-break 3-point percentage among 98 players with at least 50 attempts . But the biggest key to the Lakers\u2019 post-break offense may be a big jump in minutes for Julius Randle. He\u2019s actually seen a drop in usage rate and not much of an increase in efficiency, but Randle has gone from averaging less than 25 minutes before the break to 34 since the break. As a result, he\u2019s averaged 21.5 points (on 59 percent shooting) over the 13 games. And in that stretch, the Lakers have scored 14.2 more points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (114.1) than they have with him off the floor (99.9) . 1. Utah Jazz Utah\u2019s improvement started with the return of Rudy Gobert from a month-long absence in mid-January. Since his return on Jan. 19, the Jazz have allowed just 96.2 points per 100 possessions, 6.5 fewer than any other team . Over those nine weeks, the difference between the Jazz and the second-ranked Spurs (102.7) is more than the difference between the Spurs and the 20th-ranked Hawks (109.1). More improvement came with the acquisition of Jae Crowder at the trade deadline. And the Jazz have allowed a paltry 85 points per 100 possessions in 308 minutes with Crowder and Gobert on the floor together , with their opponents shooting just 38 percent from the field and 31 percent from 3-point range . And the Jazz haven\u2019t allowed their opponents to do much with all those misses, grabbing 85 percent of available defensive boards ( a rate which would lead the league by a wide margin ) in those 308 minutes. There is a schedule-related boost here. Since the break, the Jazz have played seven games against the league\u2019s bottom-10 offenses (including six against the bottom six) and just three games against the top 10 . But in two of those three games (Feb. 26 vs. Houston and March 11 at New Orleans), they held their opponent under a point per possession. They\u2019ve now done that in nine straight games and in 18 of their last 24 . Given the state of league-wide offense (this is now the most efficient season in league history), that\u2019s pretty remarkable. The Jazz have four games remaining against top-10 offenses, including two against the Warriors. One of those is Sunday at Golden State ( 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). 2. Indiana Pacers The Pacers have improved defensively six of their 14 post-break games having been against teams that rank in the top 11 offensively (the 11th-ranked Wizards have bounced in and out of the top 10). They\u2019ve gone 3-3, but held those top-11 offenses \u2013 Milwaukee (x 2), New Orleans, Washington (x 2) and Toronto \u2013 to just 103.4 points per 100 possessions (about four fewer than the league\u2019s post-break average) over the six games. The Pacers\u2019 post-break defense has been at its best, allowing just 96 points per 100 possessions , with Myles Turner on the floor. Turner has been improved offensively since the break ( seeing a sizeable jump in effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage ), but his defense has been more important. While Turner has made an impact inside, forcing turnovers has been a big part of the Pacers\u2019 defensive improvement. They lead the league in opponent turnover rate since the All-Star break , having forced 17.4 per 100 possessions, up from 15.1 ( 10th ) before the break. Victor has been the league leader in steals this season at 2.2 per game , and has seen an increase ( from 2.1 to 2.8 ) since the break, with Thaddeus Young (2.3) joining him in the top four in post-break steals per contest . The Pacers have also rebounded a little better, grabbing 77 percent of available defensive boards ( 15th in the league ) since the break, up from 76 percent ( 27th ) before it. Things haven\u2019t gone so well on the other end of the floor. The Pacers have seen the league\u2019s biggest drop in offensive efficiency since the break. They ranked sixth offensively (108.5 points scored per 100 possessions) before the break and rank 26th (101.6) since the break . Oladipo (from 59 percent to 46 percent) and Young (from 54 percent to 45 percent) have seen two of the eight biggest drops in effective field goal percentage since the break among 142 players who took at least 300 shots before the break and have taken at least 100 shots since the break. The improved defense will continue to be tested in the next couple of weeks. The Pacers will play six of their next eight games against top-10 offenses. That includes two games against the second-ranked Warriors and two more against the seventh-ranked Clippers. L.A. is in Indiana on Friday. Here\u2019s a look at the players who have seen the biggest increases in effective field goal percentage since the All-Star break. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Popovich would later say that he\u2019d never encountered an injury like Leonard\u2019s during his long coaching career. Leonard finally made his season debut on Dec. 12 as the Spurs lost to the Mavericks . He saw limited action in eight of the next 16 games, averaging 16.2 points in 23.3 minutes, before returning to the sideline in early January.

The Warriors host the Atlanta Hawks on Friday ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), a game that the club is reportedly targeting as a likely return date for Curry\u2019s return. He\u2019s listed as probable for the contest, per Anthony Slater of The Athletic. Curry has been out since March 8, which is when he sprained his right ankle against the San Antonio Spurs. He was cleared by the team to practice on Tuesday and did exactly that on Wednesday. His return was a welcome sight for the Warriors, who have been without fellow All-Stars Kevin Durant ( ribs ) and Klay Thompson ( thumb ). Additionally, Draymond Green exited Monday night\u2019s loss to San Antonio with a pelvic contusion . Golden State trails the Houston Rockets by four games for the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference. The Warriors are a sparkling 40-10 with Curry this season, and would likely need him if they have any hope of catching the Rockets out West. Golden State has been the top team in its conference in each of the last three seasons. This season, Curry is averaging 26.3 points, 6.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game for the Warriors (53-18).

More than three dozen people lined up to file through doors of Notre Dame seminary shortly after the casket bearing Benson\u2019s body arrived, accompanied by his widow Gayle, executives of the professional sports franchises he owns, and Archbishop Gregory Aymond, among others. Some chanted a familiar cheer \u2013 \u201cWho `dat say they gonna beat them Saints\u201d \u2013 as they waited for visitation to begin. Others began singing \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In,\u201d as the line began moving inside. \u201cHe just meant so much to the city,\u201d a somber but smiling Craig Preston, a New Orleans resident, said as he walked in. The occasion brought back memories for Andrew Ferdinand, 22, who was 11 years old when a revitalized Saints team \u2013 led by coach Sean Payton and quarterback Drew Brees \u2013 beat the Atlanta Falcons in a newly repaired Superdome, lifting spirits in the beleaguered city a year after Hurricane Katrina. \u201cTom Benson\u2019s a big part of New Orleans,\u201d said Ferdinand, \u201cAfter Katrina, he stayed. He put all of this work into New Orleans to make it thrive again.\u201d Kenneth Collns, 54, sported Saints-themed garb as he approached the seminary with other mourners and well-wishers later in the morning. But it wasn\u2019t just sports that brought him to pay his respects. He noted Benson\u2019s philanthropy, including financing of a cancer center at a local hospital. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to do those things,\u201d said Collins. Benson\u2019s body was to lie in repose at the seminary chapel Wednesday from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m., and Thursday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. A private funeral Mass is set for noon Friday at St. Louis Cathedral. The 90-year-old Benson\u2019s death was announced last Thursday. He had been hospitalized since Feb. 16 with flu symptoms. Benson was already a success in the automobile business when he bought the Saints in 1985. Under his ownership, the NFL team achieved its first winning seasons and a Super Bowl championship. He bought the city\u2019s NBA franchise in 2012. His death last week followed a public, acrimonious family split: Benson made it known in January 2015 that he intended for Gayle Benson, his third wife, to inherit complete control of the Saints and Pelicans. Greg Bensel, the senior vice president of communications for both clubs, said the NFL and NBA have both approved Benson\u2019s succession plan. Until then, Benson\u2019s daughter, Renee, and her two children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc, had been in line to take over the Benson business empire. An attempt by the estranged heirs to have Benson declared mentally incompetent failed in court."},{"id":41240,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/list-injured-players-growing-playoffs-approaching","date":"2018-03-21","title":"Postseason runs, Finals dreams may hinge on health status of these names","content":" Kevin Love returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday . Stephen Curry is set to return a few days from now to the Golden State Warriors. This means injuries won\u2019t ruin any of the playoff and title contenders here in the home stretch and beyond, right? Not necessarily. And it might be a stretch to suggest Love and Curry are in the clear, too. Nobody can take anything for granted, because history says when you do, you\u2019re doomed. Every spring, something happens to torpedo a team\u2019s chances of going deep into the playoffs, and in a few cases, winning championships. Take the last several seasons and cringe at this list of players who saw some or all of their postseasons wiped out form injuries: Love , Curry , Kyrie Irving , Russell Westbrook , Chris Paul , Blake Griffin , Kawhi Leonard \u2026 just to name a few. Teams have become smarter (and slicker) about giving their stars a break during the regular season, and closely monitoring aches in the post-All-Star break period. And, of course, they\u2019re always just keeping their fingers crossed. All it takes is a key injury to change the complexion of the title chase and destroy most if not all of the momentum built in the previous seven months. Therefore, here\u2019s a look at the injury situation facing potential playoff and title-contending teams and weighing their degree of concern, from high to mild. Ty Lue, Cleveland Cavaliers coach:  Yes, we start with a coach, whose chest pains and other symptoms caused him to step away from the bench a few days ago. Lue\u2019s condition is largely mysterious because he\u2019s keeping most of it private, and understandably so. This much, we know: Coaching the Cavs can hike the stress in one\u2019s life , because of the title-or-bust expectations. After the Cavs underwent a midseason makeover, Lue\u2019s job became more of a challenge as he essentially was holding training camp to help indoctrinate new players into the World of LeBron. Lue is projected to stay away from the team for about a week, and even when (if) he returns, who knows if this will repeat itself, not only during the playoffs, but into next season? Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors:  Curry is listed as \u201chigh\u201d because of his well-documented ankle history, and also this is the second time this season he suffered a sprain. As always, there\u2019s a heightened sense of alarm whenever Curry falls to the floor and his importance to the Warriors is apparent. And, as usual, there\u2019s no guaranteed way to prevent an ankle injury from happening again.  Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs:  The longer he sits, the stranger it gets. Limited to just nine games because of a quad injury that\u2019s lingered longer than anyone anticipated, Leonard\u2019s status is a shoulder shrug. He could return soon , he could return in time for the playoffs \u2014 if the Spurs make it \u2014 or he might not return until next season. It\u2019s up to him and his body. The Spurs aren\u2019t putting any urgency on him getting healthy even if their 50-win season streak and playoff streak could hinge on that. In the few times he\u2019s addressed his injury, Leonard was coy. Maybe he doesn\u2019t really know, either. John Wall, Washington Wizards:  After undergoing a debridement procedure on his left knee at the end of January , Wall has taken up residence on the Wizards\u2019 bench \u2014 often behind a pair of aviator shades \u2014 while his teammates forge ahead. They\u2019ve managed to stay in contention for the last six weeks, feeding a silly notion that the Wizards are better off without Wall. For sure, they\u2019ve played a different brand of ball, with more touches for everyone. When Wall returns, there will be a readjustment necessary for everyone. Make no mistake, Wall deserves (along with fellow All-Star Bradley Beal) a meaty portion of the offense.  Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves:  He had meniscus surgery on Feb. 25 and is on schedule to return form the knee injury before the end of the season. The Wolves have looked shaky without him, playing break-even ball and losing their grip as a top-four team in the West. The reason for concern, aside from surgery, is his workload; Butler was averaging 37 minutes a night. Does that get reduced when he returns for the playoffs, when the Wolves need him the most? Any minutes restriction will surely put Minnesota at a disadvantage in the first round, because Butler brings the playoff experience the Wolves lack. Klay Thompson, Golden State Warriors:  He\u2019ll be re-evaluated for his fractured thumb on Thursday ; Thompson vowed to \u201cbe back sooner than a couple of weeks\u201d when the break was discovered. If he\u2019ll be healed then, there\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be fear of re-injury. But again, the Warriors are understandably hypersensitive about injury , which could be their biggest threat against repeating as champions. Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics:  The surgery on his right thumb went well and Smart insists he won\u2019t miss the playoffs. Smart\u2019s a tough guy and there\u2019s no need to doubt him. Plus, he has a relatively full season behind him and is still in game shape. However, the sight of him working out with the injured Gordon Hayward isn\u2019t what the Celtics need. His defense is crucial for a team that keeps the scores low. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics:  Another reason the Celtics have conceded the best-record in the East is Irving. Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said Irving will, at some point, require left knee surgery (perhaps this summer). The good news is there has been no structural damage to the knee reported. Regardless, the Celtics won\u2019t push his minutes down the stretch for someone who has been out since March 11. Other than Irving, the Celtics lack a lethal scorer, and a deep run in the postseason will lean heavily on Irving\u2019s ability to play 35-plus minutes and average well into the 20s in scoring. They need him to be as fresh as possible. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors:  Yes, the rash of Warriors injuries stretched to Durant, who\u2019ll require a few weeks to recover from a rib cartilage fracture . If it lingers the rest of the season, then it\u2019ll smell precautionary, and why not? There\u2019s nothing on the line for the Warriors right now and they don\u2019t need the best record in the West more than the Houston Rockets do. For Golden State, it\u2019s all about being healthy in mid-April (and May and June). Malcolm Brogdon, Milwaukee Bucks:  His recovery from a partially torn left quadriceps tendon suffered in early February has hampered the Bucks, who\u2019ve gone 10-12 and are sliding in the East, where they sit on the playoff fence. Brogdon had settled into an important starting\/sixth man role while averaging 30 minutes a night. He\u2019s targeting the first week of April for his return and there\u2019s no telling what position the Bucks will be in then. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans:  One of the pleasant surprises of the season happened when New Orleans, led by Anthony Davis, went on an unexpected tear after Cousins\u2019 season was finished with a torn Achilles . But they\u2019ve cooled a bit after winning 10 straight and rising to top-four in the West. Davis can only do so much, and while Jrue Holiday has looked better, the Pelicans might need to overachieve the rest of the way to outwrestle the Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz and the Spurs for a more favorable playoff seeding. (Provided, of course they make the playoffs, which isn\u2019t a guarantee.) Andre Roberson, Thunder guard (out). Weird how the Thunder somehow caught their stride not long after losing their best defensive guard for the season and find themselves sitting in fourth place in the tough West. That\u2019s not to say OKC won\u2019t miss Roberson . Suppose they see Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs in the first round, or get James Harden and the Rockets in the West semifinals? Roberson was their best first-line of defense against those superstars. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

I don\u2019t care if Gobert can only max out at 56 games this season because of his two DL stints; he is a monster, a one-man wrecking crew at that end of the floor, and Utah\u2019s defensive numbers when he\u2019s playing are just staggering. The Utah Jazz\u2019s best five-man unit is its newest one, with Jae Crowder joining Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles on the floor. Among five-man units with 100 minutes together or more this season, per NBA.com\/Stats, guess what that Jazz auintet is doing defensively? Try a Defensive Rating of 80.1. Now, Crowder\u2019s a big part of that, but Gobert has been amazing. In an era where 3-pointers rule, he nonetheless has made Utah impenetrable by roaming the paint and nearby areas and snuffing any and all opponent sorties anywhere close to the rim. George leads the league in deflections , and while it\u2019s true he got a lot of help from Andre Roberson before the latter\u2019s season-ending patella tendon injury, PG-13 is still a wildly effective player both on and off the ball. Watch him shred opponent\u2019s dreams from the weakside some nights. Embiid\u2019s presence has made Philly a top-10 defense, both with shot blocking and rebounding. Smart is Boston\u2019s chief defensive catalyst. Without him, their defensive numbers plummet, and that\u2019s with Al Horford \u2014 who could well be a DPOY candidate himself \u2014 still on the floor. Smart is just such an irritant to opposing ball handlers, having perfected the art of disruption without fouling, never allowing a straight-line drive and having eliminated the ridiculous flopping that pockmarked his first two years in the league. Steve Aschburner : Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert is my choice to win this award by a margin as wide as James Harden\u2019s deserves to be in the Kia MVP balloting. Yes, Gobert appeared in only 45 of the Jazz\u2019s first 71 games, but his presence has been so profound in the team\u2019s defensive numbers that the games he missed help to argue his case. To me, Nos. 2 and 3 on the DPOY ballot will be mostly ceremonial and required, so I\u2019ll give nods to Draymond Green (again) for his versatility and inclinations in the Golden State Warriors\u2019 system, and to Al Horford for his solid positional work for the Boston Celtics. Shaun Powell :  No. 1: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans . Love how he has changed the Pelicans\u2019 season without DeMarcus Cousins, and while his offense has rightly received much of the credit for that, Davis\u2019 D (leads the league in blocked shots and top 25 in steals) is giving the short-handed Pells a chance to win. No. 2: Rudy Gobert, Jazz. Much like Davis, Gobert has jet-fueled the Jazz rally by bringing back his defense, which was sorely missed while he sat with injuries. He\u2019s the league\u2019s premier rim protector. No. 3: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors . Not sure if he\u2019ll win this award and become the second straight Warrior to do so, but Durant\u2019s defense has received lots of applause this season and it\u2019s perhaps overdue. John Schuhmann :  1. Rudy Gobert. He\u2019s missed 26 games, but has made such a huge impact when he\u2019s been healthy, and the Jazz have been far and away the best defensive team in the league (allowing 6.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than any other team) since he returned in mid-January . 2. Joel Embiid. The Philadelphia 76ers are a top-five defensive team and Embiid is the biggest reason why. He ranks as one of the league\u2019s best rim protectors and the Philly defense has been at its best with him on the floor . Those two guys are the clear top two. Anthony Davis, Al Horford or Jusuf Nurkic will probably end up third on my ballot. Andre Roberson would have represented the perimeter players had he stayed healthy. Jimmy Butler\u2019s presence has made a huge impact on the Wolves\u2019 defense , but even with him on the floor, they don\u2019t have the numbers of a top-10 defense.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019d normally go with a defensive specialist first on my list, but Paul George has been absolutely fantastic as the league\u2019s best perimeter defender this season . Not having to tote the offensive load he had to in Indiana has allowed him to show off the skills that make him one of the league\u2019s handful of truly elite two-way players. Even with some of the Thunder\u2019s defensive struggles as a team, he and Andre Roberson stood out (before Roberson was lost for the season to injury). Anthony Davis leads the league in blocks and, along with Rudy Gobert, is the most imposing rim protector and shot altering presence in the game today. Davis is No. 2 on my list and Gobert edges out Kevin Durant for No. 3 , even though I think Durant is more versatile in terms of how many positions he can defend."},{"id":41243,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-different-about-these-portland-trail-blazers-vs-2016-17-version","date":"2018-03-21","title":"Blogtable: Why are these Portland Trail Blazers better than last season's team?","content":"* * * The Trail Blazers have virtually the same roster they had last season but seem to be a whole lot better this season. What\u2019s different about this Portland team?  * * * David Aldridge : Defense. Portland has gone from awful last season ( 21st in the league in Defensive Rating at 107.8 ) to sterling this season ( seventh in Defensive Rating, at 104.3 ). They\u2019re fourth in the league in defensive field goal percentage allowed ( .447, ahead of Utah, San Antonio and Toronto ) and fifth in points allowed ( 103.2 ). Damian Lillard is playing out of his mind at both ends; we all have seen the scoring tear he\u2019s been on, but he\u2019s also fourth in the league among starting point guards playing regularly this season in Defensive Rating (103.7), only behind Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball and Kyrie Irving. C.J. McCollum is doing his Robin thing again; Maurice Harkless has become a solid starter at the three ( career-high 41.4 percent on 3-pointers ) and rookie Zach Collins is giving them all kinds of energy off the bench, using his length and fearlessness effectively. Steve Aschburner : Portland is a much improved defensive team compared to last season. When you go from 107.8 points per 100 possessions to 104.3 this season , when you improve from 21st in the league on that side of the ball to 7th (per NBA.com\/Stats), you should see a W-L difference. And here\u2019s something inside that improvement that might be overlooked: the Blazers are giving away fewer points in the form of free throws, an average of 4.7 fewer attempts and 4.2 fewer makes per game compared to 2016-17. They are fouling less, playing more honest and confident defense overall. Having big man Jusuf Nurkic in the middle all season has helped on that front. Shaun Powell :  The Blazers are playing with a sense of purpose and showing a togetherness that wasn\u2019t always there before. I think Damon Lillard and CJ McCollum are trusting their teammates more, and their teammates are repaying that trust with better decision-making and solid play when it counts. The Blazers have some impressive pelts on the wall: Warriors twice, Cavs, OKC, Wolves. But also understand that Portland has had generally good health and isn\u2019t resting players. The Blazers are all-in here down the stretch, trying to get the No. 3 spot; you just hope, for their sake, that there\u2019s still gas in the tank come mid-April. John Schuhmann :  The Blazers were the league\u2019s most improved team after the All-Star break last season , so this is, in part, a continuation of the growth they saw after trading for Jusuf Nurkic last February. Last season, they were a bottom-five defensive team before the break and a top-10 defensive team after it . On defense is where the improvement has continued, and the defense has been at its best with Nurkic on the floor . He has been a difference maker from the day he arrived. The improvement of Shabazz Napier has also been critical in those minutes when Damian Lillard or C.J. McCollum go to the bench, and the Blazers have been really good ( plus-24 points per 100 possessions ) with all three of their small guards on the floor together.  Sekou Smith :  As we\u2019ve learned in recent seasons, so much of what makes a decent team good and a good team great is the chemistry of the entire group. The Trail Blazers appear to have found the right mix this season after struggling to get it right a year ago. Damian Lillard is having an outstanding season, pushing his way into the Kia MVP conversation with the way he\u2019s performed. And C.J. McCollum is playing at a high level alongside him in what could be an All-Star backcourt some day soon. The improved play of their supporting cast is what sticks out about this crew. Coach Terry Stotts challenged them publicly earlier this season, a brilliant move in hindsight. And they\u2019ve responded. They don\u2019t need to carry the load, that\u2019s what Lillard and McCollum do on the regular. They simply have to play their roles and trust the process, so to speak."},{"id":41242,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-how-big-kevin-loves-return-lineup-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2018-03-21","title":"Blogtable: What does Kevin Love's return mean for Cleveland Cavaliers?","content":"* * * Kevin Love is back after missing seven weeks with a broken hand. What does his return mean for the Cavaliers?  * * * David Aldridge : They will, ultimately, have a chance to become the best version of themselves this season with Love in the middle. He\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t like playing center, but we\u2019re down to crunch time now, and with the days in between playoff games I suspect Love will remain Cleveland\u2019s starting center in the postseason, relegating Tristan Thompson to the bench. The Cavs have no chance of becoming a good defensive team this year, so the only way they can go deep in the playoffs is to outscore people. With his ability to stretch the floor and rebound at both ends, Love gives them their best chance of doing just that. He\u2019ll allow Larry Nance, Jr., to come off the bench with Jordan Clarkson for a high-energy second unit that should be able to score out of transition more, which would further help the Cavs\u2019 \u201cget to 110\u201d formula for postseason winning. Steve Aschburner : It means good things for the Cavaliers and even better things for Love , who will be more appreciated now as that team\u2019s second-best player. The Cavs, not getting for a variety of reasons the boost expected from GM Koby Altman\u2019s trade-deadline moves, needed help. Love, no longer the third wheel after LeBron James and either Kyrie Irving or the unknown of Isaiah Thomas that loomed over 2017-18\u2019s first half, brings his considerable offensive skills and his size as a one-man cavalry. There still might be things to blame by season\u2019s end in Cleveland but Love, for a change, won\u2019t be one of them. Shaun Powell :  Love can only have a positive impact on the Cavs by being the No. 2 option. After losing Kyrie Irving and then seeing the Isaiah Thomas experiment fizzle, the Cavs now turn to someone who can, and must, ride shotgun. The trick for Love is meshing with a rotation that was changed drastically while he was out. His return is the reason why everyone should\u2019ve taken the Cavs\u2019 recent struggles with a grain of salt. They\u2019re still the team to beat in the East, with all due respect to the Raptors (hint: it has to do with No. 23). John Schuhmann :  On paper, it means a lot. The Cavs\u2019 other two centers \u2014 Larry Nance Jr. and Tristan Thompson \u2014 can\u2019t shoot, so Love\u2019s presence gives them another shooter on the floor, which obviously makes a huge difference offensively and gives Cleveland a higher ceiling. But Love\u2019s return in itself also means nothing. Over the last two seasons, success for the Cavs has been more about the urgency with which they play (especially on defense) than who is on the floor. This has been a pretty mediocre team all season (that 18-1 stretch was against a lot of bad teams) and through Tuesday, the Cavs are a minus-26 with James and Love both on the floor . So having the two together again does not automatically solve the team\u2019s problems.  Sekou Smith :  It means the Cavaliers got their second-best and most important player back in the mix just in time for this team to start their late-season rally. It also means LeBron James eases back into a familiar comfort zone that doesn\u2019t require him to serve as the first, second and third option (now he can be just the first and second). Most importantly, though, is that the time before the playoffs being used to get everyone comfortable with their postseason roles. The pressure is off of newcomers (relatively speaking, of course) George Hill, Rodney Hood, Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson to play above and beyond their normal ways to try to make up for the absence of an All-Star\/walking double-double in Love. Having Love healthy and available for the playoffs means everything for a Cavaliers team dealing with one issue after another, the latest being coach Ty Lue\u2019s indefinite absence for heath reasons ."},{"id":41237,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-rodney-hood-tristan-thompson-questionable-vs-toronto-raptors","date":"2018-03-21","title":"Rodney Hood, Tristan Thompson out tonight vs. Toronto Raptors","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Raptors vs. Cavaliers (7 ET) The Cleveland Cavaliers have been dealing with a multitude of injuries of late as Rodney Hood (back), Tristan Thompson (ankle), Larry Nance Jr. (hamstring) and Cedi Osman (hip flexor) have been sidelined.

After raising more than enough funds to do that, the next question may be whether or not to put one up in Cleveland as well. Similar types of billboards have been launched by other fans, first by a remodeling company in Philadelphia (which put the billboards installed in Cleveland) and also by an attorney in Los Angeles (who had them put up in L.A.) . James can become a free agent this summer and many fan bases around the NBA are hoping their team takes a shot at signing him. Late last week, the minds behind \u2018Trillblazin\u2019 , a Trail Blazers-themed social media presence, started a Go Fund Me campaign to raise $2000 for a LeBron billboard in the city . According to The Oregonian \u2018s Tim Brown, the group quickly surpassed that goal after getting donations from around the country, as well as from local business and celebrities who hail from Portland (such as comedian Ian Karmel and the rock band Portugal The Man). Trillblazin co-founders Ira Lafontaine and Keith Kunis are watching as their Go Fund Me campaign continues to skyrocket, opening the possibility of putting up transit ads in Portland or, perhaps, a sign in Cleveland near Quicken Loans Arena. Here\u2019s more from The Oregonian : Personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani put up four billboards around Los Angeles to try and woo James, who can enter free agency this summer . ESPN.com reported the Philadelphia billboards were leased by Power Home Remodeling, a company based in Chester, Pennsylvania. The company\u2019s CEO says the goal is to bring James, a three-time NBA champion, to Philadelphia because \u201cwe think the best athletes should want to play here.\u201d When the billboards in Philadelphia were erected, James couldn\u2019t help but be flattered by them. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not. Not a distraction,\u201d James told reporters on Feb. 27 . \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering \u2014 but people in their respective city want me to play for them. That\u2019s cool I think. That\u2019s dope.\u201d The 33-year-old James can opt out of his contract this summer with the Cavaliers. He\u2019s said in the past that he would like to end his career with Cleveland, but because he hasn\u2019t given the team a long-term commitment, there is constant speculation that he may leave his home state a second time. James famously announced he was taking his \u201ctalents to South Beach\u201d and signed with the Miami Heat in 2010. He won two NBA titles in four years with the Heat before returning to Cleveland in 2014 Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":41247,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-isaiah-thomas-open-returning-even-reserve-role","date":"2018-03-21","title":"Isaiah Thomas open to staying with Los Angeles Lakers, even in reserve role","content":" Isaiah Thomas has played in 16 games for the Los Angeles Lakers to date, with all but one game coming in a reserve role.

(AP) \u2014 Tracy McGrady is a Basketball Hall of Famer, meaning he\u2019s already reached the absolute pinnacle of accolades celebrating his playing career. That doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t deeply moved by the latest gesture. McGrady was enshrined Tuesday into the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame , a long-deserved hat tip to what the Central Florida native accomplished during his 295-game tenure with the team. The two-time NBA scoring champion went into the Basketball Hall this past September, and said getting recognized by the Magic still meant more than he could express. \u201cYes, I got inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, but today is special to me,\u201d McGrady said. \u201cOn a personal level, growing up in Auburndale, Florida, my mom used to drive over here every summer when I was playing basketball in Orlando \u2026 and I used to tell my mom, I would tell my friends that I was going to be wearing this uniform one day.\u201d Few wore it better. Drafted in 1997 about a month after his 18th birthday \u2013 by Toronto, Orlando\u2019s opponent on Tuesday night \u2013 McGrady went on to play 15 NBA seasons. He was an All-Star seven times, a run that started with each of his four seasons with the Magic, and he remains Orlando\u2019s franchise leader with a scoring average of 28.1 points per game. \u201cTo say you represented the Orlando Magic well would be a vast, vast understatement,\u201d Magic CEO Alex Martins told McGrady during the ceremony. McGrady\u2019s 62 points against Washington in 2004 remains a Magic single-game record, and he has three of the team\u2019s four highest scoring efforts. The only players to score more points during their tenures in an Orlando uniform are Dwight Howard and Nick Anderson, both of whom played more than twice as many games as McGrady did with the Magic. He signed with Orlando as a free agent, and landing him couldn\u2019t have been easier. McGrady said he once told former Magic coach Doc Rivers after an Orlando-Toronto game to hold a spot for him that summer. \u201cNobody had to do any recruiting,\u201d said McGrady, who wore jersey No. 1 in honor of his favorite player growing up \u2013 former Orlando star Penny Hardaway. \u201cI knew I was coming home.\u201d He\u2019s still with the Magic as well, juggling a job as special assistant to the CEO alongside his duties as an ESPN analyst. McGrady was born in Bartow, Florida, about 60 miles from Orlando. Besides the Raptors and Magic, McGrady also played for Houston, New York, Detroit and Atlanta. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody more deserving than him to be in the Magic Hall of Fame,\u201d Martins said."}]
