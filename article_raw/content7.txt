The 6-foot-5 Edwards was the nation\u2019s freshman scoring leader at 19.1 points per game in 2019-20 for the Bulldogs, before the pandemic halted the season. The 19-year-old native of Atlanta has sharp long-range shooting touch, an ability to score off the dribble and a nose for driving to the basket, though he comes to the league with some questions about focus and effort after an uneven one-and-done college season. President of basketball operations Gersson Rosas promised to be aggressive about entertaining trade offers for the top pick but ultimately opted to keep it. The Wolves also entered the evening with the 17th selection in the first round, plus their second-rounder, the No. 33 pick. Memphis center James Wiseman and guard LaMelo Ball, who played professionally in Australia last season, were the other prospects widely considered in the top three. Edwards will now slide into the lineup on the perimeter, buttressing the building blocks the Wolves believe they\u2019ve cemented with center Karl-Anthony Towns and point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell. There\u2019s plenty of room to grow after a 19-45 finish that had them left out of the NBA\u2019s postseason bubble. Minnesota has made the playoffs only once in the last 16 years, a first-round loss to Houston in 2018. This was the second time in 32 drafts for this franchise that the Timberwolves held the top pick. They took Towns, now a two-time All-Star, with the first overall selection out of Kentucky in 2015. The Wolves had the worst record in the league the previous season, so they earned that spot, but this year was stunningly the first time they\u2019d ever benefited from the ping-pong balls and moved up from their default slot. Rosas wasted no time putting his stamp on the team during his first year in Minnesota, making three significant in-season trades. The trio of swaps dumped a total of nine different players, including Andrew Wiggins, the up-and-down scorer whose athleticism once had him as the ideal sidekick on the wing to Towns. The most significant of those deals sent Wiggins to Golden State for a package that included Russell, the offense-minded ball-handler who has been a close friend of Towns since they were the first two picks in the 2015 draft."},{"id":419111,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hornets-select-lamelo-ball-with-no-3-pick","date":"2020-11-19","title":"LaMelo Ball thrilled to play for Hornets, Jordan","content":"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 LaMelo Ball is thrilled to have a chance to play for the Charlotte Hornets. But the 6-foot-7 point guard is more excited to play for the one of the greatest basketball players of all time in Michael Jordan. \u201cMan, straight blessing, for real,\u201d Ball said of the six-time NBA champion and current Hornets owner. \u201cI don\u2019t even have enough words to say, I\u2019m just blessed.\u201d The Hornets selected Ball with the No. 3 pick in the NBA draft, giving Jordan\u2019s team a player with immediate notoriety and a rookie who can help put fans in the seats once the coronavirus subsides. Ball has amassed more than 5.6 million followers on Instagram \u2014 which is 600,000 more than last year\u2019s No. 1 draft pick Zion Williamson. \u201cHe\u2019s a very young talented player who plays the kind of pace that we like to play,\u201d Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak said. \u201cHe has a flare to his game that maybe has some entertainment to it, maybe more so than some other players. (But) that\u2019s not why we drafted him. We drafted him because of his size and length and the way he can handle the ball and the way he pushes the ball.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what the addition of Ball means for Charlotte\u2019s starting backcourt of Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier, the team\u2019s two leading scorers last season. Graham averaged 18.2 points per game in his second season, while Rozier averaged 18 points per game after coming over from the Celtics. Kupchak said he\u2019s not concerned about that, adding that he could foresee Ball playing some point forward alongside four other players who are 6-7 or shorter. Ball said he\u2019s all for that. \u201cI feel like I fit anywhere,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt is positionless basketball. I feel like I can get it and go.\u201d Ball is most comfortable with the ball in his hands and brings exceptional ball handling and court vision to the NBA after averaging seven assists per game last season for Australia\u2019s Illawarra Hawks of the National Basketball League. He\u2019s considered a fearless shooter and has shown the ability to get shots off quickly because of his shiftiness. He finished 17th in the NBL last season in scoring, averaging 17 points per game although he only played in 12 games. Ball first earned national attention during his freshman year at Chino Hills High School in California where he won a state title playing alongside his older brothers LiAngelo and Lonzo, who now plays for New Orleans Pelicans. Ball left to play professionally overseas after his junior season of high school, first playing in the Lithuanian league and later for the Hawks. Lonzo and LaMelo are the first brothers to be selected in the top five. \u201cI feel like I was born to do this,\u201d Ball said. The Hornets have not won a playoff series since the 2001-02 season, but are hoping Ball can help change that."},{"id":419008,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-thompson-injures-leg-during-workout","date":"2020-11-19","title":"Warriors' Thompson injures right leg during workout","content":"Golden State guard Klay Thompson injured his right leg Wednesday during a workout in Southern California.

The Thunder, per reports, have already agreed to acquire Green from the Lakers in exchange for Dennis Schroder. Horford signed a multi-year deal with Philadelphia in 2019 after a three-year stint with Boston. The 34-year-old big man, however, did not provide the spark the 76ers hoped would push them over the top in the Eastern Conference. The five-time All-Star averaged 11.9 points at a career-low 45% shooting clip last season before Philadelphia was ultimately swept out of the first round of the playoffs by Horford\u2019s former team. Now, with new general manager Daryl Morey at the helm, the 76ers appear intent on surrounding Embiid and All-Star guard Ben Simmons with a more perimeter-oriented supporting cast.

While there\u2019s rampant speculation about James Harden and Russell Westbrook in Houston, it could be that Chris Paul is the only All-NBA player who changes teams before training camps open in early December. The trade: The Suns traded Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque and a 2022 1st-round pick to the Thunder for Chris Paul and Abdel Nader.  The timing:  It\u2019s done ! Paul is the \u201cPoint God\u201d and ranks seventh on the all-time assist list . But the upgrade for the Suns here isn\u2019t really about his passing, because Rubio is a brilliant dime-dropper as well \u2026 After earning MVP honors at last year\u2019s World Cup, Rubio helped the Suns see the second biggest improvement in offensive efficiency from 2018-19 (105.3 points scored per 100 possessions, 28th in the league ) to \u201919-20 (111.3, 12th ). He was the only player in the league with at least 80 assists to four different teammates: 108 to Devin Booker, 89 to DeAndre Ayton, 82 to Oubre, and 81 to Mikal Bridges.  The Suns\u2019 offensive improvement came with the league\u2019s biggest jump in the percentage of their field goals that were assisted, from 59.5% (17th) in \u201918-19 to 66.1% ( second ) in \u201919-20. They actually ranked higher in player movement (11.4 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possessions, seventh in the league) than they did in ball movement (335 passes per 24 minutes of possession, 13th), according to Second Spectrum tracking. And that player movement featured some fun wrinkles in their offense. This play, where two back-screens set up a cross-screen for Booker, is a favorite \u2026 The Suns run a lot of \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cstack\u201d pick-and-roll, where Booker sets a back-screen on the initial screener\u2019s defender and then flares out to the top of the key. Here they set it up with an extra screen from Booker \u2026 How about a designed play against zone? You could certainly argue that leadership is the biggest reason that the Suns, who have missed the playoffs for 10 straight years (tied for the fifth longest drought in NBA history), traded for the 35-year-old Paul, who\u2019s made the playoffs in each of the last 10 years. And the intangibles are obviously there. But in regard to tangible skills, where he helps the Suns most is shooting. While they\u2019re both terrific passers, there\u2019s a huge difference between Paul and Rubio in regard to putting the ball in the basket themselves. Last season, Paul had an effective field goal percentage of 54.4% on pull-up jumpers, a mark that ranked second among 150 players who attempted at least 100. Rubio ranked 127th at 38.8%. Whether the Suns are running the more sophisticated stuff or simple pick-and-roll actions, having a bigger threat to shoot off the dribble will open things up elsewhere on the floor. Defenses often went under screens against Rubio, making it more difficult for him to gain an advantage \u2026 Paul doesn\u2019t just take advantage of a drop coverage. He can break ankles to get to his spot \u2026 Paul will also make things easier for Booker, who, despite the addition of Rubio last season, saw a drop in the percentage of his jumpers that came off the catch for the fourth straight year (from 46% as a rookie to 24% last season). With Paul handling the ball and demanding respect from the screener\u2019s defender, and with the screener (Ayton) diving to the rim, Booker can feast on the weak side of the floor, where Paul can set him up by looking off defenders \u2026 If the catch-and-shoot 3 isn\u2019t there, Booker can attack a close-out \u2026 He ranked fifth (right behind Paul) with 413 pull-up 2-point attempts last season and his 46.7% on those pull-up 2s ranked 20th among 97 players who attempted at least 100. (Paul ranked first at 54.8%.) Booker is also a capable passer himself, whether he\u2019s playing on or off the ball \u2026 Paul should also be critical for the Suns in close games. He was Mr. Clutch last season, leading the league in clutch points scored (150) and ranking second in both clutch effective field goal percentage (minimum 50 field goal attempts) and clutch free throw percentage (minimum 25 attempts). While the Thunder\u2019s record was a little inflated by how well they played in close games, the Suns were the only team that missed the playoffs with a positive point differential, going 16-21 in games that were within five in the last five minutes . Booker shot 6-for-29 (20.6%) on clutch 3s, the third worst mark *among 27 players who attempted at least 25. * The best mark among players with at least 25 attempts? Kelly Oubre Jr.: 12-for-25 (48%). Clutchness comes and goes. Paul shot 4-for-16 (0-for-9 from 3-point range) in the clutch in 2018-19. But better shooting off the dribble should lead to better offense down the stretch of close games. Over the last few seasons, there\u2019s been a decent correlation between how well a team has shot on pull-up jumpers and how efficiently it\u2019s scored on clutch possessions. \u2022 This trade unites two of last season\u2019s most successful lineups. The Thunder\u2019s lineup of Paul, Dennis Schroder, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari and Steven Adams outscored its opponents by 29.9 points per 100 possessions, while the Suns\u2019 lineup of Rubio, Booker, Bridges, Oubre and Ayton outscored its opponents by 20.2 per 100. Those were the two best marks among 53 lineups that played at least 150 minutes together. \u2022 With Oubre missing the restart, Cameron Johnson started in his place. And the Suns\u2019 Johnson-instead-of-Oubre lineup was almost as good, outscoring its opponents by 16.5 points per 100 possessions in its 142 total minutes ( +15.2 per 100 in 107 minutes in the restart). With Oubre\u2019s departure though, re-signing Dario Saric (a restricted free agent) should be a priority. \u2022 The Thunder were 13.4 points per 100 possessions better with Paul on the floor (+6.9) than they were with him off the floor (-6.5) last season. That was the biggest on-off NetRtg differential among players who played at least 1,000 minutes, and that was the third time in the last six seasons that Paul had (or tied for) the league\u2019s largest on-off differential. In the 13 seasons for which we have on-off data, Paul\u2019s differential has never been lower than 5.1 points per 100 possessions, and it\u2019s been 10 or greater in eight of those 13 seasons. We\u2019ll see how much the Suns stagger the minutes of their two All-Stars. \u2022 Oubre was one of seven players who attempted at least 100 pull-up jumpers and at least 100 catch-and-shoot jumpers (118 players total), with a better effective field goal percentage on the pull-up jumpers (51.9%, 11th best among 150 players with 100 pull-up attempts ) than on the catch-and-shoot jumpers ( 51.4 %). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

We bring them together to come up with a good estimate of how the Draft could play out ( last update: Nov. 17, 11:04 p.m. ET ): No. 1 (Timberwolves): Anthony Edwards (9) No. 2 (Warriors): James Wiseman (12) No. 3 (Hornets): LaMelo Ball (8) No. 4 (Bulls): Deni Avdija (9) No. 5 (Cavaliers): Obi Toppin (9) No. 6 (Hawks): Tyrese Haliburton (5) No. 7 (Pistons): Patrick Williams (5) No. 8 (Knicks): Killian Hayes (3) No. 9 (Wizards): Onyeka Okongwu (7) No. 10 (Suns): Isaac Okoro, Devin Vassell (3) No. 11 (Spurs): Saddiq Bey (4) No. 12 (Kings): Devin Vassell (4) No. 13 (Pelicans): Kira Lewis Jr. (4) No. 14 (Celtics): Precious Achiuwa, Cole Anthony (3) Most common (above): Pick at which the player is most commonly projected, with number of mock drafts in parentheses. For example, Anthony Edwards is projected to go 1st in nine of the 12 mock drafts listed below. Top 14 (below): To calculate the consensus, we award 14 points for every mock draft in which the player went first overall, 13 for second, continuing to one point for the final lottery pick. The player with the highest point total represents the top overall selection, which is as follows: Georgia | Position: G | Height: 6-5 Status: Freshman Most Common: 1 (9) Athletic scorer has the ability and explosiveness to score in transition or as a spot-up shooter; should contribute immediately and eventually become a franchise-changing star Memphis | Position: C | Height: 7-1 Status: Freshman Most Common: 2 (12) Skilled big man has the size combined with athleticism to potentially become a dominant force on both ends of the floor Illawarra Hawks (NBL)| Position: G | Height: 6-7 Status: International Most Common: 3 (8) Dynamic ballhandler with innate passing ability who can step in immediately as a team\u2019s point guard. Will need to work on his shot, but Ball is a franchise-changing guard Maccabi Tel Aviv | Position: G\/F | Height: 6-9 Status: International Most Common: 4 (9) Plays like a guard, but has the size and length to give defenders fits; Aggressive, competitive playmaker with a great feel for the game Dayton | Position: PF | Height: 6-9 Status: Sophomore Most Common: 5 (9) Dynamic athlete who was National Player of the Year thanks to big dunks and ability to shoot from the outside; combination of size and athleticism make him an intriguing option Iowa State | Position: G | Height: 6-5 Status: Sophomore Most Common: 6 (5) Scoring guard put up good numbers (50.4% FG, 41.9% 3FG) in college; has the size and wingspan to make an impact on the other end USC | Position: C | Height: 6-9 Status: Freshman Most Common: 9 (7) Raw, athletic big man has size and agility to become major finisher above the rim; Long wingspan and quickness make him potentially elite rim protector Florida State | Position: SF | Height: 6-8 Status: Freshman Most Common: 7 (5) Young big man has all the physical tools to become a lockdown defender; raw on offensive side of the ball, but showed flashes of a midrange game Ulm, France | Position: G | Height: 6-5 Status: International Most Common: 7, 8 (3) American-born lefty shooter who played overseas has raw talent and playmaking ability, but needs to improve on shooting Auburn | Position: F | Height: 6-6 Status: Freshman Most Common: 9, 10 (3) A difference maker on both ends of the floor; can shut down opposing guards with a unique skillset, but needs to work on offensive game Florida State | Position: G\/F | Height: 6-7 Status: Sophomore Most Common: 12 (4) Multifaceted, athletic wing with all-around game that should translate well to NBA; Has explosiveness and leaping ability, can also shoot well from the outside Villanova | Position: G\/F | Height: 6-8 Status: Sophomore Most Common: 11 (4) Prototypical 3-and-D player who can score in a variety of ways and defend multiple positions Vanderbilt | Position: F | Height: 6-6 Status: Freshman Most Common: 12 (3) Possibly the best shooter in the draft, one who can score off the dribble, catch-and-shoot or in transition; has the size and length to become an elite player on both ends of the floor Alabama | Position: PG | Height: 6-3 Status: Sophomore Most Common: 13 (4) Combo guard who thrives in transition with outstanding speed and creativity with the ball.

A spokesman for Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Tuesday officials have been in contact with the Raptors and will continue to engage with them \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d Raptors general manager Bobby Webster told Sportsnet television the team needs to know \u201cin the coming days. This is not a next week type thing.\u201d The Raptors and the NBA need an exemption to a requirement that anyone entering Canada for nonessential reasons must self-isolate for 14 days. The U.S.-Canada border remains closed to nonessential travel. The federal government denied the Blue Jays\u2019 request to play in Toronto earlier this year because health officials didn\u2019t think it was safe for players to travel back and forth from the United States, one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. The number of cases in both countries, but particularly in the U.S, has surged since then. \u201cThe health and safety of Canadians is our government\u2019s top priority and reducing the spread of COVID-19 must always be top of mind,\u201d Hajdu\u2019s office said in statement. \u201cWe understand that many Canadians are eager to see their favorite professional teams return to play. We are reviewing a proposal from the NBA and the Toronto Raptors for the resumption of NBA basketball in Canada.\u201d The NBA season is set to open Dec. 22, with training camps beginning in about two weeks. Time is running out for the Raptors. \u201cWe are working on, as everyone knows, a kind of parallel path here which is we want to stay in Toronto but as we all know time is of the essence and we are also working on a path to play elsewhere,\u201d Webster said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe want to be in Toronto. We want to play here. But we are also realistic about the timing and respectful of the protocols. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t necessarily affect our operations. We all know we\u2019ll run a basketball team and the 72 games will get played. But just where that is probably more of a \u2014 as everyone can imagine \u2014 drain on personal decisions and families which always looms large in this industry.\u201d Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto and the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network, doesn\u2019t think the Raptors should be allowed to play in Canada. Nor does he expect the government to approve it. \u201cI anticipate the Raptors will have to play south of the border,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThe logistics, the optics, make no sense.\u201d Morris calls the U.S. a disaster and noted there won\u2019t be a bubble in the NBA this time. This season will require teams to travel in the U.S. The Blue Jays failed to persuade the federal government to grant exemptions and played home games in Buffalo this year. Two cities in Florida \u2014 Tampa and Fort Lauderdale \u2014 along with Nashville have been reported as potential destinations for the Raptors. The Canadian government requites a comprehensive public health plan and written support from local health officials. The plan is being reviewed by the Public Health Agency of Canada."},{"id":418180,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-announces-structure-and-format-for-2020-21-season","date":"2020-11-18","title":"NBA announces structure and format for 2020-21 season","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA today announced the structure and format for the 2020-21 season, which will include a Play-In Tournament to determine the teams that will fill the seventh and eighth playoff seeds in each conference. The NBA\u2019s 75th regular season will begin on Tuesday, Dec. 22 and feature 72 games for each team. The opponent breakdown for the regular season is available here and described below: Each team will play three games against each intraconference opponent (42 total games per team), with each pairing featuring either two home games and one road game or one home game and two road games. Within each team\u2019s division, the league office has randomly assigned which two opponents will be played twice at home and which two opponents will be played twice on the road. \u2022 All five teams from within a division will play all five teams from one other intraconference division twice at home, and all five teams from the remaining intraconference division twice on the road. \u2022 Each team will play two games against each interconference opponent (30 total games per team), with each pairing featuring one home game and one road game. \u2022 The 2020-21 regular-season schedule will be released in two segments. The schedule for the First Half of the season will be released around the start of training camp. The schedule for the Second Half of the season will be released during the latter part of the First Half portion of the schedule. The Second Half schedule will include the remainder of each team\u2019s 72 games not scheduled in the First Half as well as any games postponed during the First Half that can reasonably be added to the Second Half schedule. The All-Star break is scheduled to take place March 5-10, 2021, between the First Half and Second Half of the regular season. Earlier today, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved a proposal to implement a playoff Play-In Tournament on a one-year basis for the 2020-21 season. The Play-In Tournament, which will take place after the regular season and before the first round of the playoffs, will include the teams with the seventh-highest through the tenth-highest winning percentages in each conference. The teams with the seventh-highest and eighth-highest winning percentages in each conference will each have two opportunities to win one game to earn a playoff spot. The teams with the ninth-highest and tenth-highest winning percentages in each conference will each have to win two consecutive games to earn a playoff spot. At the conclusion of the regular season, the team with the seventh-highest winning percentage in each conference will host the team with the eighth-highest winning percentage in its conference in a Play-In Game (the \u201cSeven-Eight Game\u201d). The winner of the Seven-Eight Game in each conference will be the seventh seed in the playoffs for its conference. The team with the ninth-highest winning percentage in each conference will host the team with the tenth-highest winning percentage in its conference in a Play-In Game (the \u201cNine-Ten Game\u201d). The loser of the Seven-Eight Game will host the winner of the Nine-Ten Game in a Play-In Game, and the winner of that game will be the eighth seed in the playoffs for its conference. Below is the tentative schedule calendar for the 2020-21 season: \u2022 Dec. 11-19, 2020: Preseason games \u2022 Dec. 22, 2020 \u2013 March 4, 2021: First Half of regular season \u2022 March 5-10, 2021: All-Star break \u2022 March 11 \u2013 May 16, 2021: Second Half of regular season \u2022 May 18-21, 2021: Play-In Tournament \u2022 May 22 \u2013 July 22, 2021: 2021 NBA Playoffs"},{"id":418157,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lamelo-ball-says-he-was-born-to-be-overall-no-1-pick","date":"2020-11-18","title":"LaMelo Ball says he was 'born' to be overall No. 1 pick","content":"The brevity of LaMelo Ball\u2019s answers during a Zoom interview Tuesday indicated nervousness bubbling beneath the surface. But for the youngest of the Ball brothers, you should know better. If Ball, 19, becomes the No. 1 overall selection of the 2020 NBA Draft on Wednesday, the pick serves as confirmation his winding road to the league proved worth the journey and all the outside handwringing accompanying it. He\u2019s already played professionally in the Australian NBL as well as Lithuania. He competed at the SPIRE Institute in Ohio, as well. All of that took place after Ball left Chino Hills (Calif.) High School as a junior; after he had committed to play collegiately at UCLA. \u201cI don\u2019t look at anything like that as pressure,\u201d Ball said. \u201cBeing the No. 1 pick definitely holds a lot, but I feel like I was born for it.\u201d Ball certainly received the requisite training and experience having grown up looking up to older brothers, Lonzo, the No. 2 pick of the 2017 draft (currently playing for the New Orleans Pelicans), and LiAngelo, who is now plying his trade in the NBA G-League. LaMelo started high school early at Chino Hills to play alongside his brothers, and even dropped 92 points in a 2017 game, which ranked as the second-highest total in California high school history. LaMelo Ball\u2019s father, LaVar, believed in his three sons so much that he predicted back in May that all three would one day play for the Los Angeles Lakers. In fact, LaVar Ball pulled LaMelo \u2014 who had already landed his own signature shoe through the family\u2019s Big Baller Brand \u2014 out of Chino Hills while LiAngelo left UCLA, so the brothers could sign one-year deals with Prienai-Birstonas Vytautas of the Lithuanian Basketball League. Let\u2019s keep in mind LaMelo was 16 at the time, but the journey to play professionally overseas paid dividends. \u201cI feel like when you go overseas, it\u2019s a whole new different style of play; something that you can just add to the arsenal,\u201d Ball said. \u201cSo, I feel like it helped me in that aspect.\u201d Ball moved on in the summer of 2018 to the Junior Basketball Association, a league established by LaVar Ball for high school graduates that didn\u2019t want to attend college. Months later, LaMelo Ball left the JBA to finish high school at SPIRE. At 18, Ball joined the Australia NBL for the 2019-20 season and ranked second in the league in scoring (17 points per game), second in assists (7 apg), and steals (1.7 spg) in addition to finishing eighth in rebounding (7.5 rpg). A foot injury limited Ball to just 12 regular-season games, but in that short span, he became the first NBL player since 2005 to tally triple-doubles in consecutive games. Not bad for a youngster with no college experience playing in a league against adults, but Ball knew exactly where the path led, regardless of how it looked to outsiders. \u201cYou could say it was a gamble, but for me, I already figured out what was gonna happen, me going there, what I was getting myself into,\u201d Ball said. \u201cSo, it wasn\u2019t really a gamble. Just looking [from the outside], you\u2019d probably think it\u2019s a gamble.\u201d Maybe, but it\u2019s clear the move paid off. Now he\u2019s preparing for what\u2019s next. \u201cI feel like I was born for this whole thing going on,\u201d Ball said. \u201cYou only go through this process once. So, I\u2019m really just enjoying all of it.\u201d Ball moved to Detroit in March to continue training for the NBA Draft, and he said during Tuesday\u2019s Zoom call that he\u2019s conducted workouts with Minnesota, Golden State, Charlotte and Detroit. The Timberwolves, Warriors and Hornets own the top three picks, respectively, while the Pistons sit at seventh. LaVar Ball prefers that his son plays for the New York Knicks or Detroit. \u201cHe probably just likes the big market,\u201d LaMelo Ball said. \u201cHe raised me, taught me the game pretty much; everything I knew when I was little. So, I appreciate all that. It\u2019s my pops, so he\u2019s always gonna be involved. But pretty much it\u2019s been me and [trainer] J.J. (Jermaine Jackson) getting to it.\u201d LaMelo Ball mentioned that his Zoom interview on Tuesday felt like a typical day. For Ball, that entails \u201cwaking up, going to work out and shoot. After that, get some breakfast in me, come back, stretch and stuff, go to the gym right after that. [I\u2019ll] get back to it at around 6 o\u2019clock, back in the gym. I\u2019ve also got band workouts and stuff, stretching and all that preparing the body. Then, late at night, [I\u2019ll] probably get something to eat watch and movie and then restart the day.\u201d Obviously, that changes somewhat Wednesday with Ball poised to be selected among the top of the draft, if not No. 1 overall. Ball pointed out that he doesn\u2019t compare himself to any other player in the NBA, and despite his impressive showing in the NBL with the Illawarra Hawks, observers witnessed plenty of deficiencies in the youngster\u2019s game. Ball struggled to knock down shots from deep, hitting just 20 of 82 from 3-point range (24.4%). He also connected on just 37.3% from the floor with an unorthodox shooting stroke that scouts believe diminished his accuracy. Ball will also need to develop into a better defender in the NBA. His 6-7 frame, natural talents and hoops pedigree suggest the youngster is up to the task. With more than 5 million followers on Instagram, Ball has already starred in the Facebook reality show \u201cBall in the Family\u201d, and he once played in an AAU game against last year\u2019s top pick Zion Williamson that received more than 800,000 views on Facebook Live. So, Ball is plenty ready for the spotlight, displaying the humility at 19 that he\u2019ll need succeed in it for the long haul. Asked about the role he envisions for himself as a rookie, Ball didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cPretty much whenever I get there, and [whatever] the coach asks me to do, I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d he said. * * * Michael C.

Wholesale roster changes, triggered by and swirling around the lone generational, cornerstone talent they hold dear as their constant. An embrace of something Biblical as a basketball strategy \u2014 \u201cLet us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die\u201d\u2013 fully aware that if not for the absolute commitment to today, what comes tomorrow might not matter. What the Milwaukee Bucks are doing to go all-in for the 2020-21 season, and entice Giannis Antetokounmpo to sign a long-term contract extension to stay with the franchise in a gray, unglamorous Midwestern market is remarkably reminiscent of something that played out 17 years ago. Similar setting, similar circumstances. The Bucks are hoping for a better outcome. Jon Horst, Milwaukee\u2019s general manager, did a masterful job Monday, both in the moves he orchestrated late in the day and the cover he gave himself earlier. In the morning, Horst fielded media questions ostensibly about Wednesday\u2019s Draft, most focused more on the urgency facing his team as it tries to a) break through to the Finals after two disappointing playoff collapses, and b) convince Antetokounmpo that his ambitions and best interests on and off the court can be served right there in Milwaukee. Horst responded with what sounded like boilerplate, standard-issue front office verbiage meant to plug the silences where real answers would be: Every offseason is a big offseason. \u2026 If we had won an NBA championship last season, this would be our biggest offseason, to figure out how to do it again. \u2026 Our core is intact. We have to figure out what to do on the margins. \u2026 We\u2019ve been really going for it since Day 1. Championships aren\u2019t just linear. \u2026 We\u2019re trying to add the best talent, the best culture fit, the best roster fit we can for [coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s] system, for Giannis\u2019 skill set and for the city of Milwaukee. This will be no different than it\u2019s been in the past. Hours later, things got way different, real fast. First, Horst and New Orleans\u2019 David Griffin reportedly worked out a trade agreement to send Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday to the Bucks, who in turn sent out guards Eric Bledsoe and George Hill with three first-round Draft picks (in 2020, 2025 and 2027) and the right to swap picks in 2024 and 2026. Then the Bucks arranged a sign-and-trade for Sacramento wing Bogdan Bogdanovic, giving up Donte DiVincenzo, Ersan Ilyasova and D.J. Wilson while taking back fringe forward Justin James. Holiday is a valued combo guard with a strong defensive presence, considered an upgrade over Bledsoe (especially so in consistency). Bogdanovic is creative offensively with a sharpshooter\u2019s range and accuracy. Together, they were being viewed Tuesday as Milwaukee\u2019s grab at a title and sales pitch to Antetokounmpo. The moves \u2014 on top of Wesley Matthews\u2019 and Robin Lopez\u2019s decisions not to opt-in for 2020-21 \u2014 leave the Bucks with only Antetokounmpo, Khris Middelton, Brook Lopez and Giannis\u2019 bro Thanasis under contract from last season. In fact, the back-to-back Kia MVP winner is the team\u2019s only Draft pick (2013) still on the roster \u2014 and quite possibly will remain so for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s a gutsy approach, one that will rise or fall on Horst\u2019s and Antetokounmpo\u2019s abilities in the near term to sell Milwaukee 2021 to available veteran players angling for a shot at an NBA championship ring. (Given the current bench, the Greek Freak\u2019s days of averaging a comfy 30 minutes per game probably are over.) It\u2019s also the opposite of safe, except that playing it safe right now would be the least safe thing of all for the Bucks. Running back a pat hand that got swept by Toronto after taking a 2-0 lead in the 2019 East finals, then gentlemanly swept by Miami in the conference semifinals in September would be far riskier. Another postseason disappointment with few on-court adjustments to keep Antetokounmpo from being game-planned into irrelevance would put the Bucks in jeopardy of imploding from within if their star were to leave. That is the worst-case scenario, not anything related to injuries or underperformance now. This isn\u2019t simply about going for it today and worrying about tomorrow later. More like going for it today, knowing some other GM, coach and support staff will be charged with fixing tomorrow. That\u2019s how things played out 17 years ago, when the Minnesota Timberwolves faced essentially the same problem and responded in pretty much the same way. Back then, Garnett was Antetokounmpo, the extraordinary individual talent in need of an upgrade in teammates and a better sense that winning was possible with a flyover franchise not known for it. He was down to just one season left on his historic six-year, $126 million contract (signed in 1997), with only a string of seven consecutive first-round playoff exits to show for it. Garnett was loyal. He wanted to stay in Minnesota. But he was frustrated, too, and needed some proof of life from the Wolves\u2019 front office. That\u2019s when VP Kevin McHale and coach Flip Saunders got their Horst on. In a matter of weeks, a team that had won 51 games in 2002-03 was barely recognizable. In came Latrell Sprewell, Sam Cassell, Michael Olowokandi, Trenton Hassell, Ervin Johnson, Fred Hoiberg and Mark Madsen. The only returnees: Garnett, Wally Szczerbiak, Troy Hudson and Gary Trent. Like these Bucks, those Wolves even shed their first-round pick \u2014 using it to select instant trivia answer Ndudi Ebi \u2014 at a point when they already had been stripped of four other No. 1 picks as penalty for the Joe Smith salary-cap circumvention. (Even Smith, so valued they cheated to land him, was gone, bundled with Anthony Peeler to Milwaukee for Cassell and Johnson). The moves worked, short term and really short term: Garnett signed another nine-figure contract with the Wolves, a five-year, $100 million extension, four weeks before the regular season began. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the fans. I\u2019m excited for the city. I\u2019m excited!\u201d Garnett said at his signing, on the concourse level at Target Center. That swiftly constructed team won 58 games with its salty Big Three of KG, Sprewell and Cassell. Garnett was named MVP, Minneapolis enjoyed its finest NBA season since George Mikan roamed the courts and the Wolves got to the West finals against, by the spring of 2004, a ready-to-be-toppled Lakers dynasty of Shaq, Kobe and Phil. Trouble was, Cassell came up lame with a strained hip, however. Hudson was hurt and Minnesota wound up using Hoiberg and journeyman Darrick Martin at point guard for the conference title. It lost in six games, with Detroit stepping up to stop L.A. in the Finals. The following season, the pixie dust was gone. Sprewell made his infamous \u201cfeed my family\u201d remark in the midst of contentious contract talks, Cassell threw in emotionally with him, the overpaying of role players jammed the Wolves\u2019 maneuverability and a 25-26 record in February was enough to get Saunders fired. The Wolves went from 44 to 33 to 32 victories with their superstar in his prime, burned through a couple more coaches (Dwane Casey, Randy Wittman) and was on its way to just one playoff appearance in the past 16 seasons. That extension Garnett signed in the giddiness over new teammates and purported championship potential? That exceptional player who claimed to have \u201cblue and green\u201d running through his veins wound up leaving for Boston with two years left on the deal. Before long, he was giving LeBron James advice not to make the same mistake he had made, sticking around too long, being too loyal. \u201cLoyalty is something that hurts you at times,\u201d Garnett said from the podium after the Celtics bounced James and the Cavaliers in the 2010 East finals. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t get youth back.\u201d Antetokounmpo might want to remember all that, about what can happen when a team goes all-in, before he goes all-out in locking up his future. The contract will be sitting there for him next offseason, too, by which time everyone\u2019s desperation will be a little better defined. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The trade cannot be completed until after the Draft ( Wednesday, 8 ET, ESPN ) due to league rules that prevent the trading of future draft picks in consecutive years.

Stephen Curry used to be even more baby-faced than he is now. James Harden\u2019s beard wasn\u2019t always so magnificent. On the week of the 2020 Draft, we take a look back at today\u2019s NBA superstars when they were first-year novices, long before they solidified their respective places among the all-time greats. ( Note: Players listed in order of their Draft class.)  Dubbed \u2018The Chosen One\u201d on a Sports Illustrated cover while still in high school, James has somehow managed to exceed all expectations in his 17 years in the league since being drafted No. 1 overall in 2003 . His tomahawk dunks, chase-down blocks and no-look assists are as potent as ever, though all now come from slightly bulked-up frame compared to his rookie season.  He wasn\u2019t drafted by the first team that needed a point guard, nor was he the first point guard drafted in 2005 . Yet it was Paul who earned Kia Rookie of the Year honors, after which followed 10 All-Star appearances, four assist crowns, six steals crowns and an All-Star MVP award in 2013. Now entering his 16th season (and first in Phoenix), it\u2019s easy to forget that Paul was once a bouncy young point guard capable of printing the occasional dunk poster on an unprepared defender.  The long-limbed Longhorn seemed skin-and-bones coming out of Texas in 2007 , but Durant has since added just enough muscle to thrive without compromising the otherwordly talents that make him unique. From his early days with Oklahoma City through his championship years with the Warriors and into his next chapter in Brooklyn, Durant has remained as advertised: a nearly unstoppable scorer from anywhere on the floor.  It\u2019s hard to decide what\u2019s grown more since his early NBA years: Harden\u2019s beard or his role. From former Kia Sixth Man of the Year to Kia MVP, Harden has transformed into an offense unto himself. Before all that, however, he was the No. 3 pick in the 2009 draft and an off-ball luxury for a young contender in Oklahoma City. It\u2019s hard to believe that the league\u2019s reigning three-time scoring champ averaged 9.9 points per game as a rookie.  In college, Curry was often double and sometimes even triple-teamed due to his lethal jump shot. Now, Curry is\u2026 well, often double and sometimes even triple-teamed due to his lethal jump shot. But doing the same thing at the NBA level required Curry to add muscle to a body that needed it after being drafted No. 7 overall in 2009 . The two-time Kia MVP and three-time NBA champion is now a household name, but even he needed several years to become the superstar he is now.  Like Antetokounmpo, Leonard lasted all the way to 15th in his Draft class ( back in 2011 ). Unlike Antetokounmpo, he was traded on Draft day. That was the first of many things Leonard has taken in stride since, as he has stoically added two championship rings, two Finals MVPs, and a pair of Kia Defensive Player of the Year awards to his resume. Not bad for a guy whose career began averaging less than 25 minutes and 8 points per game.  The Unibrow\u2019s potential was obvious as the No. 1 pick in 2012 . Since then, his game and frame have grown by leaps and bounds. Now a crowned NBA champion and the other half of a one-two Laker punch featuring LeBron, Davis has cemented his place as one of the dominant two-way big men in the league\u2019s history.  Heading into the 2012-13 season, the most career NBA minutes logged by a Weber State University product was the 2,033 by 2000s journeyman Eddie Gill. Then Portland drafted Damian Lillard sixth overall in 2012 , setting the stage for a former Big Sky Player of the Year to become one of the best guards of the decade. Lillard has become synonymous with the Blazers while making five All-Star teams, five All-NBA teams and the conference finals in 2019.  The 2013 draft wasn\u2019t predictable in the moment, but no one could have foreseen the 15th overall pick becoming one of the most physically gifted athletes in NBA history. Antetokounmpo was a scrawny prospect that survived and thrived despite a trying upbringing in Athens. Now, \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is the face of a Bucks franchise harboring its best championship hopes since the early 1970s.  It\u2019s been just six years since Jokic was drafted 41st overall in 2014 , but the change since then has been nothing short of dramatic. The Serbian superstar has gone from all but unknown to a staple among the league\u2019s brightest superstars. Now a two-time All-NBA center and arguably the best passing big man in NBA history, Jokic is proof that nothing is out of reach no matter where you start. * * * "},{"id":417763,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-andre-drummond-to-opt-in-with-cavs","date":"2020-11-17","title":"Report: Andre Drummond to opt in with Cavs","content":"The Cavs acquired Drummond from the Detroit Pistons for Brandon Knight, John Henson and a second-round pick at the 2019-20 trade deadline.

President of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said in a radio interview Monday the club was being cautious with Luka Doncic\u2019s European sidekick, who missed more than a season because of another knee injury earlier in his career. The NBA is in the midst of a short offseason after the pandemic-delayed 2019-20 season ended on the final day of September in the playoff bubble in Florida. Training camps are set to open Dec. 1, with the 72-game season scheduled to start Dec. 22. Porzingis injured his right knee in the opener of a first-round series against the LA Clippers in the bubble in August. The 7-foot-3 Latvian had surgery in early October. Dallas ended a three-year run of missing the playoffs behind the 21-year-old sensation Doncic and Porzingis, who played the next two games after the injury before missing the rest of a series won by the Clippers in six games. Porzingis averaged 20.4 points and 9.5 rebounds in his first season with Dallas. He missed all of 2018-19 after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during what ended up being his final game with the New York Knicks in February 2018. The Mavericks acquired Porzingis in a seven-player deal before the trading deadline in 2019 and immediately said he wouldn\u2019t play the rest of that season.

Oladipo told The Associated Press that he and business manager Jay Henderson have joined an ownership group that includes former Florida basketball player Matt Walsh to purchase the New Zealand Breakers of the Australian National Basketball League. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it will make the 28-year-old Oladipo one of world\u2019s youngest basketball team owners \u2014 and the owner of the New Zealand\u2019s home arena. \u201cI was always interested in being part of team ownership, having input with a team and helping a team be successful on the business side of things,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cTo work with a team from this perspective, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have newfound respect for the guys who have been in that position.\u201d The announcement comes at a time some have questioned Oladipo\u2019s commitment to the Pacers. He initially opted out of playing in the NBA\u2019s coronavirus bubble this summer over concerns about his injured right knee. Eventually, he backtracked and did play in Orlando. Last week, The Indianapolis Star reported that while he was in the bubble, Oladipo repeatedly asked opposing players whether they\u2019d be interested in having Oladipo as a teammate. \u201cIt is what it is, it\u2019s over with now. Emotions were felt. I have no ill will toward anybody,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cI love everyone, I pray for everyone, that\u2019s just the kind of guy I am. I just look forward to playing for the Pacers and winning a championship for the state of Indiana.\u201d In the meantime, Oladipo has continued rehabbing the knee and says he feels as close to 100% as he has at any point since rupturing his quadriceps tendon in January 2019. And he continues to contemplate life after basketball. While the two-time All-Star guard still will get an up-close look at how management makes decisions, deals with salary caps and evaluates talent, he will not be running the day-to-day operations. Henderson, who has worked with Oladipo for the past seven years, anticipates filling that job. \u201cWe do a lot of startups together, we own a few companies together and now we\u2019re going to be owners of the New Zealand Breakers,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI can\u2019t even say I dreamed about it, I always thought what it would be like to own a franchise, but you never fully expect it to happen.\u201d Oladipo has never traveled to New Zealand but has promised to make at least one trip per year to Auckland where the team is based. He said he first became interested in the league after watching American youngster LaMelo Ball play for the Illawarra Hawks last season and jumped at the opportunity to be part of it. \u201cI definitely think this league is growing, I know it\u2019s growing,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cIt\u2019s really competitive. I actually saw a few games when LaMelo was playing and I think it\u2019s becoming a hot commodity.\u201d New Zealand has been one of the league\u2019s most successful and consistent franchises. The Breakers have had only two losing seasons since 2007-08, won three consecutive NBL titles from 2011-13, claimed a fourth title in 2015 and finished as the league runner-up in 2016. They start this season seeking their first playoff appearance in four years and with some uncertainty because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Larry Kestelman, the league\u2019s owner and executive chairman, announced last week that next season is expected to tip off in early 2021. The start date has been pushed back in hopes of playing in front of larger crowds. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019m at a point in my career where I just need to focus on the game, improve on myself, improve on my body,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cBut when the ball stops bouncing, God willing it\u2019s like 15 years from now, I\u2019ll have lots of options, different avenues I can explore.\u201d"},{"id":417713,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-bogdan-bogdanovic-headed-to-bucks-in-sign-and-trade","date":"2020-11-17","title":"Report: Bogdan Bogdanovic headed to Bucks in sign-and-trade","content":"The Milwaukee Bucks are bolstering their lineup for a fresh run at the 2021 NBA title after a string of reported moves early Tuesday. Sacramento Kings guard Bogdan Bogdanovic will be heading to the Bucks via a sign-and-trade deal that was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. In the deal, the Bucks will send Donte Divincenzo, Ersan Ilyasova and DJ Wilson off to Sacramento for Bogdanovic and Justin James. The reported sign-and-trade deal cannot be consummated until Sunday at 12:01 p.m. ET, when free-agent signings will be permitted. Last season, Bogdanovic averaged 15.1 points while shooting 37.2% from 3-point range while also adding 3.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. He became a starter for the Kings in January, supplanting Buddy Hield. James, a 6-foot-7 guard who is entering his second NBA season, averaged 2.5 ppg in 36 games. The Bucks\u2019 move to add Bogdanovic came roughly an hour after a reported trade with New Orleans netted Milwaukee former All-Star and All-Defensive point guard Jrue Holiday from the Pelicans . With this pair of reported moves, the Bucks would have a starting lineup for opening night of the 2020-21 season that would feature Holiday and Bogdanovic in the backcourt, with All-Star Khris Middleton, center Brook Lopez and two-time defending Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in the frontcourt. Per The Sacramento Bee , Bogdanovic turned down a $51.4 million extension before the 2019-20 season, which was offered after the Kings gave lucrative contracts to Hield and Harrison Barnes last offseason. The Kings overhauled their front office in the offseason, with new general manager Monte McNair taking over after GM Vlade Divac and assistant GM Peja Stojakovic stepped down in August. The sign-and-trade of Bogdanovic likely signals another rebuild for the Kings, who have not made the playoffs since 2006.

Both players were selected in the 2018 Draft, with Musa as the No. 29 pick and Brown going at No. 42. Brown established himself as a key rotation player for the Pistons in 2019-20, ranking fourth on the team in minutes per game (28.2) and practically doubling his output on the court in scoring average (8.9 ppg), rebounding (4.7 rpg) and assists (4.0) while also improving as a shooter and 3-point threat.

Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Omari Sankofa II of the Detroit Free Press , the Pistons are dealing G\/F Bruce Brown to the Nets for G\/F Dzanan Musa and a 2021 second-round pick. Both players were selected in the 2018 Draft, with Musa as the No. 29 pick and Brown going at No. 42. Brown established himself as a key rotation player for the Pistons in 2019-20, ranking fourth on the team in minutes per game (28.2) and practically doubling his output on the court in scoring average (8.9 ppg), rebounding (4.7 rpg) and assists (4.0) while also improving as a shooter and 3-point threat. \u2014 9:12 a.m. * * * One of the Pistons\u2019 top 3-point shooters will be staying with the team for next season, per James Edwards III of The Athletic . Tony Snell has opted into his deal for next season, which means Detroit will bring back a player who has made 100 or more 3-pointers in three of his last four seasons (including 102 made 3-pointers in 2019-20). Last season was Snell\u2019s first with the Pistons after he arrived in a 2019 Draft-day swap with the Milwaukee Bucks. Overall, Snell averaged 8 points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game while shooting 40.2% on 3-pointers in 59 games (57 starts) with Detroit. > Free Agent Tracker  Another starter from the Lakers\u2019 championship team is reportedly set to opt out of his deal. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will decline his option for 2020-21 and enter the free-agent pool. Caldwell-Pope started all 21 games of the Lakers\u2019 run to the 2020 NBA title, averaging 10.7 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game while shooting 41.8% overall and 37.8% on 3-pointers in the playoffs. During the season, he started 26 of 69 games played, averaging 9.3 ppg, 2.1 rpg and 1.6 apg while shooting 46.7% and 38.5% on 3-pointers. \u2014 10:04 a.m. * * * As expected, Anthony Davis and Rajon Rondo will reportedly decline their player options and become unrestricted free agents following their critical roles in the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 2020 championship run. Davis is widely expected to re-sign a lucrative new contract with the Lakers, who won their first title since 2010 thanks in large part to his dominant pairing with LeBron James. Rondo, on the other hand, will reportedly negotiate with what is expected to be an array of suitors, including the rival LA Clippers. Free agents can officially start negotiations Friday at 6 p.m. ET, with actual signings starting Sunday at noon. \u2014 7:25 a.m. *** The Los Angeles Lakers are in advanced talks to acquire Oklahoma City Thunder guard Dennis Schroder in a trade, according to reports from Shams Charania of The Athletic and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. The defending champion Lakers reportedly would send veteran guard Danny Green and the 28th pick in this Wednesday\u2019s NBA Draft (8 ET, ESPN) to the Thunder in exchange for Schroder.

In two seasons with the Spurs, DeRozan has averaged 21.6 points, 5.9 assists and 5.8 rebounds in 34.5 minutes while shooting 50.3 percent from the field and 83.7 percent from the foul line. Last season, DeRozan and league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo were the only two players in the NBA to average 20-plus points, 5-plus rebounds and 5-plus assists while shooting over 50.0 percent from the field. He is also the first player in Spurs history to total more than 3,000 points, 800 rebounds and 800 assists in his first two seasons in San Antonio. A two-time All-NBA selection, DeRozan is one of just five players to score 1,500-plus points in each of the last five seasons, joining LeBron James, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook. An 11-year veteran, DeRozan was originally drafted by the Toronto Raptors with the ninth overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft.

Things haven\u2019t changed, even after only three games at the college level. The Memphis freshman headlines the list of big men in Wednesday\u2019s draft and he\u2019s unlikely to fall out of the top three picks. Beyond Wiseman is another potential lottery pick in USC\u2019s Onyeka Okongwu and a first-round prospect in Maryland\u2019s Jalen Smith. Here\u2019s a look at some of the top prospects: His college stint with the Tigers, cut short by NCAA eligibility issues, showcased a tantalizing glimpse at his skillset. Strengths: The 19-year-old has a mobile 7-foot-1, 247-pound frame that will make him a presence at both ends of the court, particularly on the glass and in protecting the rim. He ran the floor well and displayed a soft touch in the paint at Memphis, though he made highlight reels more for his array of dunking finishes. The nation\u2019s top-ranked recruit had 28 points and 11 rebounds against South Carolina State in his first game and had a double-double (14 points, 12 rebounds) in his last against a ranked Oregon team. Wiseman made 20 of 26 shots (76.9%) and swatted nine shots in his three college games. Concerns: Wiseman\u2019s last game was a year ago Thursday, so there\u2019s little for any team to study since his days dominating the high school ranks. Memphis ultimately withheld him from competition and the NCAA suspended him for 12 games before he withdrew from school last December, a sequence that cost him nearly a full season of college development. > Prospect Profile The 19-year-old freshman offers plenty of defensive and rebounding potential. Strengths: The 6-9, 245-pounder arrived as a top-25 national recruit and immediately became USC\u2019s low-post presence. He averaged a team-best 16.2 points while shooting 61.6% from the floor, finishing through contact and at the rim \u2013 frequently for dunks. He made 72% of his free throws, a promising stat considering he got the line a team-high 143 times. As a defender, he ranked ninth in the country by averaging 2.7 blocks per game, including eight in his first college game against Florida A&M, seven against TCU of the Big 12 and six against Oregon in Pac-12 play. Concerns: He\u2019ll have to continue to expand his offensive game overall beyond overpowering opponents down low or around the rim. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much shooting range he will offer to pull defenders outside after he attempted just four college 3-pointers (making one). > Prospect Profile The 20-year-old blossomed as a sophomore for the Terrapins and showed an improving inside-out game. Strengths: The 6-10 Smith was a top-20 recruit in 2018 then thrived in his second year. He bettered his numbers across the board, averaging 15.5 points and 10.5 rebounds while shooting 53.8% from the floor. More impressively, he has developed into a capable 3-point shooter, shooting nearly 37% last year while making 32 3s in 31 games. He also made 75% of his free throws, up from 65.8% a year earlier, and had a wingspan better than 7-2 in NBA combine measurements. Concerns: Smith helped himself by bulking up about 10 pounds to 225 as a sophomore, but he\u2019ll need to add more strength to handle contact in the paint and physical defenders. He also needs to improve ballhandling and creating his own shot as he develops his game further, with much of his production in college coming off feeds from Maryland\u2019s guards. > Prospect Profile"},{"id":417130,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tyronn-lue-finalizes-his-clippers-coaching-staff","date":"2020-11-16","title":"Tyronn Lue finalizes his Clippers coaching staff","content":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 New Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue has finalized his staff for the upcoming NBA season.

It was no secret why; they all wanted to see Memphis\u2019 James Wiseman, the 7-foot-1 center who was already being touted as a candidate to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft. Good thing they went that night. Wiseman hasn\u2019t been able to play a real game since. But at long last, Wiseman is about to be on a team again. More than a year removed from the end of his three-game college career \u2014 doomed almost before it started because of NCAA rulings regarding his eligibility \u2014 Wiseman will be one of the first players selected in Wednesday\u2019s NBA draft. It\u2019s hard to envision a scenario where he doesn\u2019t go in the first three picks, which are currently held by Minnesota, Golden State and Charlotte. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been a long process, a long journey. I\u2019ve been working out for nine months. I\u2019m super-ecstatic and I\u2019m super-excited to get this ball rolling and I\u2019m ready for this season to start.\u201d He has spent the bulk of this year in Miami, working and waiting. The 19-year-old has added 15 pounds of muscle onto his frame, checking in now around 255 pounds. He\u2019s worked on his outside game, to the point where he feels comfortable from the 3-point line. He\u2019s been scrimmaging of late with players like Washington\u2019s John Wall, a past No. 2 pick in Michael Beasley and veteran NBA big man Jahlil Okafor. He picks their brains, asks questions, takes their feedback and applies it to his next workout. And when that call comes Wednesday night \u2014 he\u2019ll be in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, watching the draft with family while the league conducts matters virtually from ESPN\u2019s headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut \u2014 Wiseman knows some team will be betting a significant part of its future on him. \u201cHe\u2019s a super-mature kid who understands where he\u2019s been and what he\u2019s striving for,\u201d said two-time NBA champion Mike Miller, who was part of the staff at Memphis with Wiseman last season. \u201cThe talent screams at you. I think he\u2019s one of the safest and most-talented players in this draft, a kid who will walk into a locker room and the locker room will be better for it. That\u2019s tough to say about most 19-year-olds.\u201d Wiseman \u2014 a left-hander who has drawn some comparisons to Chris Bosh, another lefty, athletic big man \u2014 gives off a clear sense of maturity. Ask Wiseman, and it comes from the belief that nothing has come easily. Wiseman believes he was underrated at times as he moved through the high school ranks. The college experience was a disaster for him; his family received $11,500 from former Memphis player and current Tigers coach Penny Hardaway to assist in a move from Nashville to Memphis in the summer of 2017, before Hardaway took over the program. Hardaway was considered a booster for the program at the time, which made the payment against NCAA rules. If that wasn\u2019t enough trouble for Wiseman, the draft process \u2014 not just for him, for everyone \u2014 has been one long waiting game. The NBA draft is traditionally in June; the coronavirus pandemic delayed it three times, first to August or September, then to October, and now to Wednesday. \u201cIt was very tough, but I\u2019m super-mentally tough,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of stuff in my life. I\u2019ve been through a lot of adversity. As a basketball player, I want to play ASAP. But it\u2019s given me a lot more time to lock in on my work, to lock in on my skillset.\u201d Make no mistake, he wants to be the No. 1 pick. But he also pointed out that one of his best interviews with a team happened to be his talk with Golden State \u2014 a team that sent a contingent including Bob Myers to that Memphis-Oregon game last year, and a team that might certainly find a use for an athletic post player to help the likes of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. \u201cWe talked a lot about my game,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cBut we mostly talked about my character, me as a person.\u201d Whoever takes him, Wiseman said he\u2019ll be ready to roll. Training camps start less than two weeks from draft night. It\u2019s going to be a difficult task for any rookie this season to get acclimated to a new city, new teammates, new everything in a very condensed window of time, but Wiseman insists he\u2019s up to the challenge. \u201cMe going through the adversity in college, people didn\u2019t see me play that much,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to prove. It\u2019s as simple as that. And I\u2019m a totally different player now.\u201d"},{"id":416993,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-thunder-agree-to-trade-chris-paul-to-suns","date":"2020-11-16","title":"Thunder trade All-Star guard Chris Paul to Suns","content":"The Phoenix Suns are making a serious push for the 2020-21 playoffs with the addition of 10-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul. The Suns traded Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque and a 2022 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Paul and Abdel Nader. The Suns acquired Rubio via free agency last summer, re-signed Oubre last summer while adding Jerome via the 2020 Draft and Lecque as an undrafted free agent last season. \u201cChris\u2019 leadership and competitive approach to the game will have an immeasurable impact on our team,\u201d Suns general manager James Jones said in a team statement . \u201cWe thank Kelly, Ricky, Ty and Jalen for their contributions to the Suns. We wish each of them all the best as they continue on what we expect to be long and productive careers.\u201d Rubio reacted to the trade news with a tweet: \u201c\u2026 what a business,\u201d he wrote. Paul has two more seasons remaining on his contract, including a player option for 2021-22. He was an All-Star in 2019-20, averaging 17.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 6.7 assists as the Thunder surprised many NBA observers by winning 44 games and pushing the Houston Rockets to seven games in the first round of the 2020 playoffs. It is a huge leap for the Suns, who went 8-0 inside the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World in a frantic, but futile, quest to make the playoffs. Paul is owed about $41 million for this season and has a $44 million player option for next season, which was too much of an impediment for other teams that considered acquiring him last summer. The Suns, however, deemed it worth the risk. They haven\u2019t made the playoffs since a run to the Western Conference finals in 2010. Paul is also president of the National Basketball Players Association. The trade reunites him with Suns coach Monty Williams; Paul played for Williams in 2010-11 when Williams was in his first season coaching the New Orleans Hornets. \u201cMan, I\u2019m 35 years old and I still get a chance to play basketball every day and say that\u2019s my way of life,\u201d Paul said last week, when asked about trade rumors during an appearance in the Time100 speakers\u2019 series. \u201cThat is crazy in itself so regardless what happens, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d With this trade, the Thunder have turned the total return on former Kia MVP winner Russell Westbrook into three future first-round picks and two pick swaps, in addition to a handful of players. Oklahoma City originally acquired Paul last summer in a blockbuster trade that sent Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for a 2021 first-round pick, a 2024 first-round pick, a 2025 first-round pick swap and a 2026 first-round pick swap. This move, in addition to the reported Dennis Schroder trade with the Lakers , would give the Thunder 16 first-round picks between 2020-2026. Wojnarowski reports the Thunder worked closely with Paul\u2019s representatives \u2014 Steve Heumann and Ty Sullivan at CAA \u2014 to get him to his preferred destination. OKC general manager Sam Presti had a history of partnering with star players on trades, including ones that featured Westbrook and former Thunder stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. Paul will team with guard Devin Booker, who in his fifth NBA season made the All-Star team for the first time as an injury replacement after Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard had to drop out. The 6-foot-5 guard saved his best moments for the bubble and averaged a team-high 30.5 points over eight games while contributing solid defense. The Suns have some decisions to make on whether to bring back forwards Aron Baynes and Dario Saric, along with guards Cameron Payne and Jevon Carter. The 6-foot-3 Payne \u2014 who was the No. 14 overall pick in the 2015 draft \u2014 was a surprise contributor after being signed just before the Suns went to the bubble: He averaged 10.9 points as a key reserve. Arguably the most intriguing player on the roster is center Deandre Ayton, who was the No. 1 overall pick in 2018. The 6-foot-11, 250-pounder is still just 22 years old and averaged 18.2 points and 11.1 rebounds. He\u2019s also had some frustrating setbacks, including missing 25 games early in the year after violating the league\u2019s anti-drug policy. Ayton is most effective on the interior but has been working on his outside shot. He hit the first three 3-pointers of his career in the Florida bubble.

The Spurs won at least 50 games in 19 of 20 seasons. The only time they didn\u2019t in that span, they won the first of their five championships in a 50-game season shortened by a labor dispute.

Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge missed the 2019-20 season restart to have shoulder surgery and remains one of the other bedrock players for San Antonio. While the Spurs had seven players average in double figures, DeRozan and Aldridge averaged almost twice as many points as the rest of them.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated assault and battery claims Oakley made in a lawsuit brought against the team\u2019s owners after his Feb. 2017 removal from a game the Knicks lost to the Los Angeles Clippers. A three-judge panel concluded a jury could decide whether it was improper for security guards to throw Oakley to the ground after Oakley, according to his court papers, slapped their hands away in self defense as he sought to watch the game. The appeals court, though, rejected Oakley\u2019s claims of defamation and false imprisonment. Oakley was a Knicks fan favorite from 1988 to 1998. He was accused of striking a security guard before he was forcefully removed and arrested outside the stadium. The charges were later dismissed. The power forward sued later the same year for unspecified damages in a defamation lawsuit claiming assault, battery and false imprisonment, contending his treatment was part of team owner James Dolan\u2019s pattern of harassment against him. The lawsuit said Dolan had frequently \u201cdisrespected\u201d Oakley by refusing to make eye contact or shake his hand during meetings and by denying him fan appreciation nights and forcing him to pay for his own ticket to games. Oakley blamed Dolan for his ouster from the game, saying he was \u201ctreated like a common criminal\u201d after Dolan directed security to \u201cforcibly remove Mr. Oakley from the Garden and publicly embarrass him on live television,\u201d the lawsuit said. It said Dolan and Madison Square Garden then launched a defamatory public relations campaign, accusing Oakley of abusing fans and staff, acting inappropriately and struggling with alcoholism. The lawsuit was thrown out earlier this year by U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan, who said the case \u201chad the feel of a public relations campaign, with the parties seemingly more interested in the court of public opinion than the merits of their legal arguments.\u201d A message seeking comment was left with lawyers for Dolan and Madison Square Garden. In a statement released by his lawyers, Oakley said: \u201cI am appreciative of the appeals court as I now have a chance to show the world what I said from day one was true. The truth is going to come out at trial and Dolan will be held responsible for what he did.\u201d His lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said: \u201cThis is a great day for Knicks fans and fans of Mr. Oakley, and we look forward to the truth of what happened finally coming out.\u201d"},{"id":416949,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-pistons-trading-bruce-brown-to-nets","date":"2020-11-16","title":"Reports: Pistons trading Bruce Brown to Nets","content":"The Detroit Pistons agreed to trade Bruce Brown to the Brooklyn Nets for Dzanan Musa and a 2021 second-round draft pick, according to multiple reports.

Which is: How do they handle the reward for surviving that? To be more precise: What should they do with Draft pick No. 2? This proud franchise, just 16 months removed from an appearance in The Finals and slightly over two years removed from a dynasty, finds itself in a peculiarly pleasant pickle. The Warriors just endured an NBA-worst 15-50 season, no thanks to major injuries suffered by Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry, and now the team is ready to boomerang back among the championship contenders. This makes them a rare elite team that\u2019s choosing high in the NBA Draft , which obviously is a premium place to be, and also obviously a perplexing one as well. The Warriors, you see, are ready to win now, but the teenager they choose Wednesday with the No. 2 overall pick, by most accounts, will not be. And so, the Warriors can either use the selection on someone they must groom patiently \u2026 or trade it for more immediate help. Do they take the long-term view, which might not pay immediate dividends and could waste the prime years of Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green? Or do they sacrifice rookie talent for very good veteran talent and go championship-or-bust the next three-to-four years? If the Warriors trade the pick, there\u2019s also the good chance they\u2019ll package it with Andrew Wiggins, if only to match salaries with the incoming player. The mood around the league regarding Wiggins is mixed, but he did play well with the Warriors last season and might flourish in the right spot. Wiggins suffers mainly from perception and money; he\u2019s not the star many thought he\u2019d be, but he\u2019s paid like one. Can the pick and Wiggins get Bradley Beal from the Washington Wizards? Would the Toronto Raptors swap Pascal Siakam and bring Wiggins, who\u2019s from Toronto, back home? Some other possible names to consider: Zach LaVine, Aaron Gordon or Buddy Hield, all in some sort of package that also brings back an additional sweetener to the Warriors. From a positional standpoint, the Warriors could use a big man, and in that case they\u2019d probably be more willing to keep the pick and take James Wiseman, assuming the seven-footer doesn\u2019t go No. 1 overall to Minnesota (which already has Karl Anthony-Towns) or some other team if the Wolves trade the pick. However, while Wiseman runs the floor well and brings a knack for low-post offense and rebounding, he\u2019s raw and requires player development. The Warriors might not have time for that. Plus, they were never built around or featured a big man during their championship era and, therefore, it could be a weird fit. Here\u2019s what Warriors general manager Bob Myers said recently: \u201cA big man almost can\u2019t stand around the rim anymore, that\u2019s hard to do. If we get a big man that can protect the rim and guard on the perimeter and switch, that\u2019s obviously highly valuable. There\u2019s not too many guys that can do that. Perimeter defense has never mattered more because so much of the offense is coming from the perimeter instead of passing it to the post.\u201d If Wiseman is gone or the Warriors simply aren\u2019t high on him, they\u2019ll have some swingman-type players who\u2019ll form a three-guard rotation along with Curry and Thompson. But again, this Draft doesn\u2019t project much in terms of immediate help for a contender, even at No. 2. Those candidates include LaMelo Ball, who who played in Australia, Anthony Edwards of Georgia, Deni Avdija from Europe or Iowa State\u2019s Tyrese Haliburton. \u201cWhoever we pick,\u201d Myers said recently, \u201cI am sure there will be some people that are happy and some people that won\u2019t be, and then they\u2019ll change their mind a month later because they\u2019re allowed to and I\u2019m not.\u201d It\u2019s unusual to see heavyweight teams sitting in the close company of lightweights on Draft day. It\u2019s an envious position for sure; while their Draft neighbors are mired in a rebuilding process, the Warriors are in the reloading business, prepared to play deep into next spring or hopefully into summer. The Draft pick can only enhance their status; essentially, the rich getting richer. The NBA historically has a small sample size of contenders holding high picks, although the end result wasn\u2019t always a bonanza. Since 1980, there are eight examples of elite teams with a top-three pick, and faced with those good and tough decisions, they either flourished or fumbled it away. 1980: Here\u2019s why Red Auerbach was a basketball savant. The year before, on the eve of Larry Bird helping the Celtics win 61 games, Auerbach flipped Bob McAdoo to the Pistons for a pair of first-rounders. Then Dick Vitale \u2014 yes, that guy \u2014 subsequently coached the Pistons to 66 losses and one of those picks became No. 1 overall in 1980. Auerbach then flipped that pick to the Warriors for Robert Parish and the No. 3 overall. He drafted Kevin McHale and the greatest front line in history was born. 1982: Two years prior, Cavs owner Ted Stepien was reckless with first-round picks \u2014 the \u201cStepien Rule\u201d now forbids teams from trading consecutive No. 1 picks \u2014 and he packed Cleveland\u2019s 1982 pick plus Butch Lee for the Lakers\u2019 No. 1 in 1980 and Don Ford. OK, fine. Well, the Cavs went into a tailspin and that \u201982 pick became No. 1 overall. The Lakers were defending champs and loaded with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and others. They then added the dynamic James Worthy , fresh off an NCAA title with North Carolina, with that No. 1 overall pick in 1982. With \u201cBig Game James\u201d in the fold, Los Angeles won three more rings. 1984: Three years earlier, the Portland Trail Blazers sent a lanky center named Tom Owens to the Pacers \u2014 he\u2019d only last one season with them \u2014 for a first rounder in \u201984. This became one of the greatest Drafts in NBA history, which is the good news. The bad news for the Blazers is they used the No. 2 pick on Sam Bowie instead of Michael Jordan, who went third to Chicago. Portland already had a hang-time swingman in Clyde Drexler and believed Bowie, a shot-blocking and rebounding force in college, would fill a need. You know the story: Bowie suffered a series of career-interrupting broken legs and Jordan, well \u2026 1986: The defending-champion Celtics benefitted from another Auerbachian heist when, two years earlier, Red sent Gerald Henderson and cash to the Sonics, who were more desperate for the cash than Henderson, so they exchanged an 1986 first-rounder. The pick became the No. 2 overall and Boston selected NBA-ready power forward Len Bias, believing him to be a perfect bridge for the Larry Bird dynasty. Less than two days after being drafted, Bias he died of cardiac arrhythmia related to usage of cocaine. 1997: When David Robinson (and later, Sean Elliott) suffered a season-ending injury in 1996-97, the Spurs collapsed. Or, according to suspicious NBA folks at that time, the Spurs tanked. In any event, they went from 59 wins in 1995-96 to 20 wins in 1996-97. Their front office executive, Gregg Popovich, took over the coaching job in December of 1996. Just as important, they entered the Tim Duncan Sweepstakes. Interestingly, the Spurs had only the third-best odds of winning the top pick. Had the Celtics (No. 2) won the lottery, Rick Pitino might still be coaching in Boston, Popovich probably doesn\u2019t become recognized as an all-time great, and the Spurs surely don\u2019t go 23 years before missing the playoffs again or get lauded as the model franchise. 2003: Once again, a defending champion had the No. 2 pick. This time, it was the Detroit Pistons, who six years earlier traded an old Otis Thorpe to the desperate expansion Grizzlies for Vancouver\u2019s future first-rounder. As we know now, the 2003 draft became one of the greatest ever. But after LeBron James went No. 1 overall as expected, the Pistons outsmarted themselves. They rolled the dice on European big man Darko Milicic, who wowed the Pistons during pre-Draft workouts. The Pistons thought they could buy time while Milicic developed. Well, Milicic was immature, had poor work habits and just wasn\u2019t very good. Meanwhile, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade, ignored by the Pistons, all turned out OK. 2017: Celtics boss Danny Ainge dumped an old Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce on Brooklyn in 2013 for a batch of future first-rounders and also gave the Celtics the right to swap picks in 2017 with the last-place Nets (when Boston was fresh off a 53-win season). That pick was No. 1 overall, and then Ainge traded down with the Sixers for No. 3. Philly took Markelle Fultz \u2014 who\u2019s no longer with the Sixers \u2014 and the Celtics took Jayson Tatum, who\u2019s about to sign a max deal any day now. Next up, the Warriors. Like many of those previously mentioned teams, the Warriors don\u2019t have a simple choice here with the No. 2: Keep it, trade it, or even trade down. What they decide could have major ramifications on the next five or so seasons and might make-or-break the remaining prime years of Curry, Thompson and Green. Also, there\u2019s a huge financial stake riding on this decision as well. The Warriors have only played one season in the pricey and privately-financed Chase Center, and that season wasn\u2019t very good. This season might have fewer (or maybe no) fans because of coronavirus and therefore won\u2019t generate as much revenue. If the Warriors make the correct decision with the No. 2 pick, it will reflect well on the bottom line, too. So there\u2019s a bit of pressure facing Myers and his staff, who didn\u2019t have the luxury of working out prospects prior to the Draft because of the coronavirus. As a team that\u2019s restless and healthy and ready to return to championship glory, the Warriors are in a good place come Draft day. Or so it seems. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter  .

Beginning, like, now! In just the next few days, all manner of NBA business that typically takes place across several weeks of summer will be jammed into the tightest calendar possible. Teams can begin making trades Monday after noon Eastern time. The 2020 Draft will be held virtually Wednesday night. Free-agent negotiations can begin Friday at 6 p.m. ET, and actual signings can be consummated Sunday starting at noon. All of this \u201cwait and hurry up\u201d green-lighting of key events from a normal NBA year was laid out in an extensive memo sent to teams, first reported Sunday by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and obtained by NBA.com. The tight turnaround from the end of 2019-20\u2019s virus-protracted season to the league\u2019s previously announced plans for 2020-21 required numerous date and pro-rating adjustments, tweaks to the collective bargaining agreement and no small amount of giddy-up in the NBA\u2019s git-along. Following the flurry of activity in the coming week, the league is planning to open training camps on or around Dec. 1. Preseason games would begin about Dec. 11, with the regular season set to start on Dec. 22. That will be 72 days after the last game of the 2020 Finals , the Lakers\u2019 106-93 Game 6 clincher over the Heat in the Orlando bubble. With a similar time frame one year earlier, Opening Night in 2019 would have been held on Aug. 24. Here are some other markers for the coming season: \u2022 An \u201cAll-Star break\u201d for players, without an actual All-Star Game, from March 5-10. \u2022 The 72-game regular season ends May 16. \u2022 Play-in tournaments for both conferences, May 17-21. Details and approval by the Board of Governors are still to come. But the No. 7 and No. 8 team on each side may meet, with the losing team facing the winner of a No. 9 vs. No. 10 game. The winner of that third game would secure the final playoff berth. \u2022 First round of the playoffs would start on May 22, with conference semifinals beginning about June 7 and conference finals around June 22. \u2022 The 2021 NBA Finals would take place July 8-22. Anyone feeling adrift in a November without NBA basketball \u2014 or at least, NBA activity and headlines \u2014 could be sated in a matter of days. Word of the current \u201ctemporary transaction moratorium\u201d being lifted Monday at noon was met almost instantly \u2014 or was it the other way around? \u2014 by a reported deal by the Los Angeles Lakers to acquire guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der from Oklahoma City for wing Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in Wednesday\u2019s Draft. (Per league rules, the trade is expected to be finalized after the Draft, with the Lakers making the 28 th selection on Oklahoma City\u2019s behalf.) Players\u2019 decisions on their contract options all are due this week, notably as soon as Monday for Lakers big man Anthony Davis. Davis, who led the champion Lakers last season in scoring (26.1 ppg), rebounding (9.3) and blocked shots (2.3 bpg), is expected to decline the $28.7 million option for 2020-21 so he can sign a longer, more lucrative deal to stay in L.A. Charlotte\u2019s Nicolas Batum has a $27.1 million option deadline Monday, too, the Associated Press reported. Other player and team options are due Thursday. An assortment of other dates and deadlines had to be updated for the shifted 2020-21 offseason and schedule, including contract guarantee cutoffs and the final days by which teams must use (or lose) trade exceptions. Golden State has a $17.2 million exception from its deal in February sending veteran Andre Iguodala to Memphis, and OKC has one worth $10.4 million from its July 2019 trade of Paul George to the Clippers. Criteria for performance bonuses have been pro-rated to account for a 72-game regular season, down from the customary 82. Adjustments also have been made to limits on two-way players whose time is split between the NBA and the NBA G League. Previously, the NBA announced that the 2020-21 salary cap would be set at $109.1 million, with a luxury-tax threshold of $132.6 million. These were indeed \u201cset\u201d rather than calculated strictly off revenues from the recently completed season, to soften the financial hit from the coronavirus-driven hiatus. The costs of the restart, the shift into summer and fall that affected TV ratings, and the need to play games with few or no paying customers all contributed to what has been estimated as a 10% decline in revenue to $8.3 billion. The restart reportedly staved off what might have been another $1.5 billion lost had the season not been completed. And a pre-Christmas start to 2020-21 could save the league another $500 million to $1 billion compared to an opening in January or later. Luxury tax liabilities will be adjusted according to the percentage shortfall in projected basketball-related revenue, an accommodation seen to help big-spending franchises while pinching some that controlled their costs for this offseason. Accommodations also have been made with the National Basketball Players Association to the long-standing escrow system, through which the general player\/team split of revenues gets adjusted each year. This year and for possibly the next two seasons, instead of 10% escrow, no more than 20% of players\u2019 salaries will be withheld to account for revenue declines. The plan is to effectively \u201csmooth\u201d the losses over time, rather than absorb the pain of 2020 all at once. Still to be determined for the coming season: the actual schedule, ways to reduce travel, any formal plans for fans or media to actually be in NBA arenas and the possibility that the Toronto Raptors might have to find a temporary new home for 2020-21. Current travel and quarantine restrictions preclude the league\u2019s other 29 teams from crossing into Canada for Raptors home games. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Here\u2019s a look at some of the top prospects: Toppin was once a 6-foot-2 high school junior who had never dunked in a game and then a senior lacking Division I offers. Now he\u2019s a high lottery prospect as a rangy power forward. Strengths: The 6-9, 220-pound Toppin\u2019s development, which included a stop in prep school and a redshirt season, turned him into an efficient scorer and high-flying dunker. He averaged 20 points despite taking 20 shots in a game only once all year. He shot 64.7% from the floor over two seasons and became a more frequent 3-point shooting threat last year (39%). The Associated Press men\u2019s college basketball player of the year also averaged 1.2 blocks. Concerns: It\u2019s unclear how good of a rebounder he will be; he averaged 7.5 rebounds but hit double figures only eight times in 31 games last year despite his explosiveness. It\u2019s also unclear how well he\u2019d handle quicker opponents when roving or switching along the perimeter, though Toppin said workouts with other NBA players and draft prospects would helped prepare him for that. \u201cPlaying against those guys has been helping me a lot, especially for defense \u2014 having to play some bigs, having to play some guards,\u201d Toppin said in a virtual news conference, adding he\u2019s working to \u201cprove a lot of people wrong\u201d on defense. > Prospect Profile The 19-year-old from Israel is a versatile playmaker with size and a still-developing game. Strengths: The 6-9, 225-pound Avdija helped Israel win the FIBA U-20 European Championships in 2018 and 2019. And despite playing opponents 1 or 2 years older in that second title run, Avdija was most valuable player by averaging 18.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 2.4 blocks and 2.1 steals. He\u2019s a good ballhandler with the versatility to lead the break, run the offense in half court or play from the post. He also became the youngest player ever to play for Maccabi Tel Aviv to start his professional career in 2017. Concerns: Avdija\u2019s shooting touch just hasn\u2019t been there. Last year, he made just 33% of 3-pointers and 59% of free throws in 59 games with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israeli and Euroleague play. During a predraft virtual news conference, Avdija said he\u2019s been working to make his stroke more efficient as he gets stronger, adding: \u201cI\u2019m a guy who likes to improve, who\u2019s looking forward to improve.\u201d > Prospect Profile The 19-year-old freshman offers positional versatility after playing in solely as a Seminoles reserve. Strengths: The Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s sixth man of the year helped the Seminoles win their first league regular-season crown. He brought athleticism and strength in a 6-8, 225-pound frame with a nearly 7-foot wingspan, giving him the ability to defend multiple positions. He averaged 9.2 points and 4.0 rebounds in just 22.6 minutes per game \u2014 he played 30-plus minutes only twice \u2014 yet had a team-high 30 blocks. He also shot 83.8% from the foul line. Concerns: Williams was a perfect fit as a complementary piece for FSU, but teams will have a limited body of work to evaluate while projecting him for a more extensive role. Williams must continue developing his outside shot after shooting 32% from 3-point range and making just 16 in 29 games. > Prospect Profile"},{"id":415003,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/heat-name-caron-butler-assistant-coach","date":"2020-11-14","title":"Heat name Caron Butler assistant coach","content":"MIAMI \u2014 The Miami HEAT announced today that former first-round pick Caron Butler is returning to where his NBA career began and will become an assistant coach on Head Coach Erik Spoelstra\u2019s staff.

Prior to joining the Sixers, Cheeks spent three-plus seasons as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers (2001-05). During his time in Portland, he posted a 162-139 (.538) mark, accounting for the seventh-highest win total in Blazers coaching history. He helped the Blazers reach the NBA Playoffs twice, and in 2002-03, tied for second in the Pacific Division with a 50-32 record. Before being head coach in Portland, Cheeks spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the Sixers, and in 2000-01 he helped guide the 76ers to a record of 56-26 (.683) and a spot in the NBA Finals. A 15-year NBA veteran, Cheeks was selected 36 th -overall in the second round of the 1978 NBA Draft by the 76ers and retired from the NBA as its all-time leader in steals after playing with Philadelphia, San Antonio, New York, Atlanta and New Jersey. He was named to the NBA\u2019s All-Defensive Team five times (First Team: 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986; Second Team: 1987) and played in four All-Star games (1983, 1986, 1987, 1988). A member of the 76ers\u2019 1983 World Championship team, Cheeks was honored by the club through having his number 10 retired. He was elected to the 2018 class of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. As an NBA player, Cheeks compiled career averages of 11.1 points, 6.7 assists and 2.10 steals in 1,101 games while shooting .523 from the field and .793 from the free throw line.

The shifty 6-foot-5 lefty is among several international prospects, continuing the NBA\u2019s global reach. Others include Deni Avdija , Israel; Th\u00e9o Maledon , France; Leandro Bolmaro , Argentina; and Aleksej Pokusevski , Serbia. There were 108 international players on opening-night rosters for the 2019-20 season. That number could increase this year and Hayes will be one the new faces. He has the ability to create space for himself or teammates. He\u2019ll benefit from the NBA\u2019s defensive 3-seconds rule and is effective running the pick-and-roll. In Europe, defenders can clog the lane. \u201cWhen he gets in the paint he\u2019s able to find his shooters, he\u2019s able to find his big men,\u201d said Peyton Siva Jr., who plays for Alba Berlin in the German league. \u201cThat\u2019s when he\u2019s more dangerous, when he\u2019s able to create for others.\u201d Playing in Ulm \u2014 Albert Einstein\u2019s hometown in Germany \u2014 Hayes showed he has room to improve. He was inconsistent from 3-point range (21.8% in 20 domestic league games; 39% in 10 EuroCup games), but is crafty with the basketball. \u201cHe hit me with a really good move at the top of the key \u2014 made me stumble and fall,\u201d said Siva, who played one season with the Detroit Pistons. Hayes finished with 20 points and 10 assists in the loss to Siva\u2019s team. Although quiet, Hayes does not lack confidence. Hayes told the French sports daily L\u2019\u00c9quipe about questions NBA teams ask during pre-draft interviews. One asked if he was a \u201cdog\u201d on the court, and Hayes replied yes. What type? He said, \u201cRottweiler.\u201d Hayes was born in Florida but grew up mostly in his mother\u2019s hometown of Cholet in western France where his American father played basketball. DeRon Hayes played at Penn State and in Europe. Killian debuted for Cholet at age 16. \u201cKillian\u2019s dad would be at every practice,\u201d ex-teammate Antywane Robinson said, \u201cin the same spot at the top of the stands. Their relationship is a beautiful one.\u201d Hayes\u2019 mother, Sandrine, never missed a game and cousins would also be in attendance. He had all of Cholet buzzing about his game. Hayes earned co-MVP honors at the Jordan Brand Classic International Game in 2017. He also played for French youth teams before declining an invite to play for a French Under-20 team. He later moved to Germany. Hayes has spent the past few months in Lakeland, Florida \u2014 his father\u2019s hometown \u2014 about 40 miles southwest of the NBA\u2019s bubble in Walt Disney World. He\u2019s been working out with another Lakeland native, Dwayne Bacon of the Charlotte Hornets. The studious Hayes said in a media video call that he tends to analyze fellow left-handers like James Harden, Goran Dragic and Manu Ginobili. Hayes said his agent told him to expect to be drafted somewhere between No. 2 and 10. Some other international NBA prospects to keep an eye on: Scouts really like the versatility of the 19-year-old from Israel but they are not as enamored by his poor free throw shooting. Avdija says not to worry. At 6-8, he can play several positions and does a little of everything. His stat line from the 2019 under-20 European Championships final: 23 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 blocks and 1 steal. Israel beat Spain for the gold and Avdija was the tournament MVP. In 59 games for Maccabi Tel Aviv last season, he shot just under 59% from the free throw line and 33% from 3-point range. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time and I think it\u2019s a matter of the head,\u201d Avdija said of the dismal percentage in a media video call. \u201cI think I can shoot even above 70%. I\u2019m going to get there.\u201d Just don\u2019t compare him to Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic \u2014 or anyone else for that matter. \u201cI just want to be the best Deni Avdija I can be,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be compared to anybody.\u201d Theo Maledon The 19-year-old Maledon is a French point guard who draws comparisons to Tony Parker. Maledon was 17 when he was named \u201cbest young player\u201d of the French league in 2018-19. That puts him in good company. Past winners include current and former NBA players Frank Ntilikina, Evan Fournier, Clint Capela, Boris Diaw and Parker. Maledon and Parker grew up in the same city: Rouen in the Normandy region. And like Parker, Maledon has considerable pro experience playing in France \u2014 and in the EuroLeague. He also played for Parker\u2019s team, ASVEL in the city of Lyon. Parker bought the team while he was still playing for the San Antonio Spurs. Maledon, 6-4 and about 175 pounds, missed time early last season with a shoulder injury and acknowledges that his draft stock may have slipped a bit. \u201cThat kind of stays in my head. I got a chip on my shoulder for that,\u201d he said in a media video call. But \u201cit\u2019s only on the court that you can prove things.\u201d Leanjdro Bolmaro Bolmaro of Argentina is another versatile international prospect. At 6-6 and 185 pounds, he can play small forward and both guard positions. The 20-year-old Bolmaro is also gaining experience coming off the bench for Barcelona in Spain\u2019s strong domestic league as well as the continental club competition EuroLeague. Bolmaro is comfortable using pick and rolls and attacking the paint to either finish himself or pass to teammates in space. Aleksej Pokusevski Serbian 7-footer Aleksej Pokusevski has mostly played in the Greek second division. NBA fans might not remember but that\u2019s where Giannis Antetokounmpo played before being drafted in 2013. Not that anyone is comparing the 18-year-old Pokusevski with the Greek Freak, but the Serbian has impressed scouts with his ball handling, shooting and defending. Playing for the Olympiacos B team, Pokusevski averaged nearly 10 points per game, 7.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks."},{"id":413781,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/udonis-haslem-to-return-to-heat-18th-season","date":"2020-11-13","title":"Udonis Haslem returning to Heat for 18th season","content":"MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Udonis Haslem announced Friday that he\u2019s returning for an 18th season with the Miami Heat, and left the door open for extending his career after that. Only five NBA players have spent a career of that length with one franchise. Dirk Nowitzki spent 21 years with Dallas, Kobe Bryant 20 years with the Los Angeles Lakers, Tim Duncan spent 19 with San Antonio, John Stockton spent 19 with Utah and Reggie Miller spent 18 with Indiana. Haslem doesn\u2019t play regularly and hasn\u2019t for years: He got into just four games last season and has scored 76 points in the last four seasons combined. His impact on the team comes from what he says and does in the locker room, and that\u2019s why Heat coach Erik Spoelstra lobbied for Haslem to come back. \u201cHe\u2019s just an incredible rock of stability and leadership and mentorship,\u201d Spoelstra said during the NBA Finals last month. \u201cThat\u2019s at all levels. It\u2019s not just to our young players. It\u2019s to our veteran players. And he provides just great guidance and mentorship to this head coach as well. I love him.\u201d So will this be the end? \u201cSpo told me don\u2019t answer that question,\u201d Haslem said at his announcement, held inside one of the Subway restaurants he owns in South Florida. \u201cSpo said we\u2019ll continue to talk about it.\u201d By NBA rule, the Heat cannot negotiate with Haslem until Nov. 20 and the earliest he can sign his new contract \u2014 his ninth with the Heat \u2014 is Nov. 22. It\u2019ll be a one-year deal worth $2,564,753. Haslem\u2019s next appearance for the Heat will make him the oldest player in franchise history. His final appearance this past season was Aug. 14, at 40 years and 66 days old. That\u2019s three days younger than Juwan Howard was when he played his final Heat game on April 17, 2013. Haslem was one of three 40-somethings to play in the NBA last season: Vince Carter was 43 when he retired after the season and Jamal Crawford, 40, appeared in one game with the Brooklyn Nets during the NBA restart at Walt Disney World. Crawford is about 2 1\/2 months older than Haslem and is unsigned for next season. Haslem is Miami\u2019s all-time leading rebounder, ranks second behind only Dwyane Wade in games and minutes played, and is No. 7 on the Heat career scoring list."},{"id":413737,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/caron-butler-hired-as-heat-assistant-ap","date":"2020-11-13","title":"Report: Heat hiring Caron Butler as assistant coach","content":"MIAMI (AP) \u2014 A person with knowledge of the situation says Caron Butler is coming back to the Miami Heat, agreeing to begin his coaching career as an assistant on Erik Spoelstra\u2019s staff. Butler and the Heat are in the process of finalizing his contract, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press Friday on condition of anonymity because the hiring has not been publicly announced. Butler was the No. 10 pick by the Heat in the 2002 draft and spent two seasons with the team, getting moved to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004 as part of the deal that brought Shaquille O\u2019Neal to Miami. He takes the opening on the staff that was vacated by Dan Craig, a longtime Heat assistant who was hired earlier this offseason by the LA Clippers. Butler played for nine teams in 14 NBA seasons, was a two-time All-Star and was part of the 2011 Dallas Mavericks team that topped Miami for the NBA title. Even though he spent only two years with the Heat, Butler has remained close with many in the organization and invited a large Heat contingent to his wedding several years ago. He has worked as a television analyst for NBA and college games since retiring and most recently hosted a series for the NBA called \u201c 1-on-1 with Caron Butler \u201d \u2014 a number of interviews to discuss the need for social justice.

And that means perfect solutions for issues that the NBA and its players are dealing with, he said, aren\u2019t likely to be found. Paul, the president of the National Basketball Players Association and guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, spoke Thursday at a Time100 event and said the league and the union are continuing to work through countless details that have to be settled before the new season begins with training camps next month and the start of games on Dec. 22 . The money issues are largely settled , with the league and the union striking a deal on escrow earlier this week and a decision being made to keep the salary cap for 2020-21 \u2014 which could have fallen substantially because of a massive hit to the planned revenues for last season \u2014 at the 2019-20 levels. But issues on health and safety and how to try to keep people safe without a bubble during a coronavirus pandemic are still being worked out, and Paul acknowledged that he isn\u2019t sure \u201cwhat this season is going to look like yet.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of questions that have to be answered,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut we\u2019re working on it.

We\u2019re working hard to try to make sure that not only our players are happy but our fans are happy.\u201d Positive test rates are soaring in many parts of the country, and the Los Angeles Lakers said Wednesday that they will begin play this season with no fans in the seats at Staples Center. The Thunder, Paul\u2019s team, have released a plan for reduced seating in their building, and it remains unclear how many teams will have fans \u2014 and how many seats will be sold in any arena. \u201cNone of the things that everyone is dealing with right now is ideal,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNothing. I think about us and we get an opportunity to play this game, right? But I also think about my kids who are doing online school day in and day out. So, the decisions that we\u2019re making \u2026 we\u2019re blessed to be in the situation that we\u2019re in. Like I said, things aren\u2019t ideal, but we\u2019re trying to make them work.\u201d Paul also was asked about reports of possible trades involving him, but said little that would provide insight on where he may play next season \u2014 or if he expects to be traded. He\u2019s owed about $41 million for this coming season and holds a $44 million player option for next season. \u201cMan, I\u2019m 35 years old and I still get a chance to play basketball every day and say that\u2019s my way of life,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat is crazy in itself so regardless what happens, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d"},{"id":413670,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-fiesta-jerseys-unveiled","date":"2020-11-13","title":"Spurs introduce new Fiesta-themed uniforms","content":"The wait is over.

Edwards was the nation\u2019s top-scoring freshman at Georgia and is a candidate to be the No. 1 overall pick on Wednesday night with his explosive scoring and ability to make contested shots. The top tier of shooting guard prospects also includes versatile players like Florida State\u2019s Devin Vassell and Auburn\u2019s Isaac Okoro, both possible lottery selections. Here\u2019s a look at some of the top shooting guard prospects: The 19-year-old started fast and finished as Southeastern Conference\u2019s freshman of the year. Strengths: The 6-foot-5, 225-pound Edwards has the ability to score from all over the court. He put it all on display six games into his college career at Georgia, going for 33 of his 37 points after halftime in an impressive one-man show in a loss to then-No. 3 Michigan State. That second-half performance included Edwards hitting 7 of 13 3-pointers. He went on to average 19.1 points to go with 5.2 rebounds while also offering the potential to develop into a reliable defender. \u201cHe\u2019s just scratching the surface, he really is,\u201d Georgia coach Tom Crean said. Concerns: While Edwards is difficult to slow, his efficiency and consistency are questions. Edwards shot just 40.2% from the field and made at least half his shots only seven times in 32 games. He also shot just 29.4% from 3-point range, including empty lines in losses to LSU (1 for 12), Mississippi (1 for 9), South Carolina (0 for 7) and Alabama (0 for 6). > Prospect Profile The sophomore could boost a team\u2019s defense and outside shooting. Strengths: The 6-7 Vassell is a good athlete with size and length, allowing him to play as a shooting guard or a small forward with a 6-9 wingspan. His biggest potential comes as a versatile perimeter defender capable after averaging 1.4 steals and nearly a block per game last year with the Seminoles. He also shot 41.7% from 3-point range over two seasons at Florida State, including an overtime-forcing 3 in an Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament win against Virginia Tech as a freshman and going 7 for 7 against the Hokies last year. Concerns: The 20-year-old must add strength to his 194-pound frame to handle matchups with bigger opponents and continue expanding his offensive game beyond his spot-up shooting. > Prospect Profile Like Vassell, Auburn freshman Okoro has high-end defensive potential. Strengths: The 19-year-old has a strong 6-6, 225-pound frame that could allow him to play as a shooting guard or small forward. He made the Southeastern Conference\u2019s all-defensive team while averaging 12.9 points and shooting 51.4%. Concerns: His offensive game, and shooting touch, is a work in progress. While his overall shooting percentage was solid, he lacked range shooting just 29% from 3-point range and made only 20 shots from behind the arc in 28 games. He also shot just 67.2% from the foul line, an area he\u2019ll need to improve as he attacks the paint to draw contact. > Prospect Profile The first-round prospect from Little Elm, Texas, bypassed college to play in the Australian National Basketball League \u201cNext Stars\u201d developmental program designed to lure elite NBA prospects. Strengths: The 6-foot-5 Hampton was ranked as the No. 5 recruit in last year\u2019s class by 247sports and can play either point guard (where he worked in the NBL) or off the ball. He is dangerous in transition and driving the paint, and offers the upside to be a good defender at the next level. Concerns: His shooting touch was lacking in 15 games in the NBL, where he shot around 40% from the floor, 30% from 3-point range and 68% from the line. He\u2019ll need to extend his range to become a reliable outside shooter to stretch defenses when playing off the ball, which will only help his off-the-dribble game as an all-around playmaker. > Prospect Profile"},{"id":412698,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tim-duncan-stepping-down-as-spurs-assistant-coach","date":"2020-11-12","title":"Tim Duncan stepping down as Spurs' assistant coach","content":"San Antonio Spurs Hall of Fame forward Tim Duncan won\u2019t be accompanying coach Gregg Popovich on the bench next season, the team confirmed on Thursday, as the former assistant plans to step away from coaching on a full-time basis.

But after Duncan retired in 2016, the forward kept a space inside the coaches\u2019 locker room at the team\u2019s facilities and routinely attended workouts, as his personal business \u2014 BlackJack Speed Shop \u2014 is less than a mile from the team\u2019s facility. As a player, Duncan played a major role in San Antonio\u2019s five championship over his 19 seasons with the Spurs. Duncan earned recognition in making 15 All-Star teams, 15 All-NBA teams and 15 All-Defensive teams, two Kia MVP awards and two Finals MVPs before joining the coaching staff as an assistant in 2019. Duncan, 44, made his debut as San Antonio\u2019s head coach back in March when Popovich missed a road game against the Charlotte Hornet to attend to personal business. The Spurs prevailed 104-103 in that game. Assistants Becky Hammon, Will Hardy and Chip Engelland still remain on the staff. To fill Duncan\u2019s position, the team promoted assistant coach Mitch Johnson and elevated Darius Songaila to assistant coach. Hammon has served on San Antonio\u2019s coaching staff since 2014, and Engelland joined the staff in 2005. The club promoted Hardy from video coordinator to an assistant coach in 2016. San Antonio\u2019s all-time leader in points (26,496), rebounds (15,091), blocked shots (3,020) and games played (1,392), Duncan became the third player in franchise history with his jersey retired to be elected in April to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Duncan ranks as just the third player in NBA history to win 1,000 career regular-season games, with just Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish capturing more victories over the span of their careers. *** Michael C.

After one successful season in Oklahoma City, the 32-year-old, unrestricted free agent tweeted a picture of himself in a blank uniform with a caption that read, \u201cWhere to next?\u201d The Thunder are seemingly ready to move on as well. They signaled as much when they parted ways with head coach Billy Donovan in early September, unable to \u201cprovide him the information on the future direction of the team,\u201d according to general manager Sam Presti. Assistant Mark Daigneault was promoted to replace Donovan on Wednesday. Though he hasn\u2019t been all that durable over the years, Gallinari should have plenty of suitors in free agency. As a prototypical stretch four, he can improve any offense. Last season, the Thunder scored 116.9 points per 100 possessions with Gallinari on the floor. That was the highest on-court OffRtg mark among 312 players who averaged at least 15 minutes in 25 games or more. And the difference between that mark and their efficiency with him off the floor ( 100.3 points scored per 100 possessions ) was the biggest among 236 players who played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team. Largest on-off-court OffRtg differential, 2019-20 OffRtg = Team\u2019s points scored per 100 possessions w\/ player on\/off floor  Minimum 1,000 minutes on floor Shooting is the most important skill in the NBA. And adding an elite shooter at power forward can make a big difference in how well an offense functions. The best part about having a shooter at the four is the space he creates for your pick-and-roll game. In the most basic of actions where he\u2019s spaced on the weak side, his defender is faced with a tough decision. If he tags the roll man, the weak-side shooter is open. And when he\u2019s 6-10, it\u2019s all that more difficult to contest on the close-out \u2026 Gallinari ranked sixth last season with 142 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. The 41.8% he shot on catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts ranked just 22nd among 81 players with at least 200, but a return of 1.25 points per attempt is one that the defense will want to do something about. And if the shooter\u2019s defender stays attached, the big has a clean roll to the rim (as part of a double-drag screen in this example) \u2026 Gallinari can also be a solo screener. A pick-and-pop with a dynamic ball-handler and a capable shooter is one of the most difficult actions to defend \u2026 Against a strong close-out, he can put the ball on the floor. His drives are neither quick nor explosive, but Gallinari can finish with control and touch \u2026 \u2026 or he can finish those drives at the free throw line. Gallinari averaged only 3.8 drives per game, but he drew fouls on 16.7% of them, the second highest rate among 185 players who averaged at least three drives per contest. His ability to get to the hoop and to the line seems to be diminishing, though. Last season, only 16% of Gallinari\u2019s shots , his lowest rate since his rookie season, came in the restricted area. His free throw rate was also down from 50.7 attempts per 100 shots from the field over his previous four seasons (sixth highest among 161 players with at least 2,000 field goal attempts over that stretch) to 36.5 per 100 last season. That mark was still well above the league average (26 free throw attempts per 100 shots from the field). And other other way that Gallinari was able to get to the basket and to the line (where he ranked sixth in the league at 89.3%) was by getting to the post. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Gallinari drew fouls on 11.1% of his post-ups, the second highest rate among 30 players who averaged at least three post-ups per game. League-wide, post-ups have been trending down for a while. But according to Synergy play-type tracking, Gallinari averaged a career-high 2.3 post-up possessions per game last season. And the 1.04 points per possession he scored on post-ups ranked fourth among 30 players who averaged at least two post-up possessions per game. While he\u2019s most comfortable playing pick-and-pop, he\u2019s willing to take advantage of a switch by dragging a guard or small wing down to the block. In a game just before the All-Star break, he did damage in the post against both Josh Hart \u2026. \u2026 and Jrue Holiday \u2026 He got two big buckets late in the same game with post-ups against Hart and Lonzo Ball . The other end of the floor is an issue. While, with Gallinari on the floor, the Thunder\u2019s offensive numbers were much better, their defensive numbers were much worse. Among those 236 players who played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team, he had the fourth worst on-off DefRtg differential, with OKC allowing 111.2 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor and just 102.1 per 100 with him off the floor . That differential was even bigger when you look at minutes with Chris Paul and Steven Adams in the game \u2013 112.6 points allowed per 100 possessions in 873 minutes with Gallinari also on the floor, just 96.8 allowed per 100 in 450 minutes with him off the floor. Though he\u2019s 6-10, Gallinari is neither a strong rebounder nor very disruptive defensively. He grabbed just 9.0% of available rebounds while he was on the floor, the fifth lowest rate among 62 players 6-10 and taller that averaged at least 15 minutes in 25 games or more. And he averaged just 0.92 steals + blocks per 36 minutes, a rate which ranked 281st among 300 players who played at least 750 total minutes last season. More critical (but related) is Gallinari\u2019s lack of mobility. At the four, he\u2019s often required to defend in space, which can be problematic. Here he is getting beat off the dribble by Danny Green\u2026 Earlier in the same game, Paul and Adams defended a pick-and-roll really well, creating a loose ball. But Gallinari was slow to react and Alex Caruso took advantage\u2026 His lack of foot speed sometimes had him guarding the opposing center when he shared the floor with the quicker Nerlens Noel. But Gallinari is not one to put much effort into rim protection, more likely to get out of the way than earnestly contest a drive \u2026 He committed just 1.5 fouls per 36 minutes, fourth fewest among 300 players who played at least 750 minutes. Gallinari is not the worst defender out there and the Thunder\u2019s best-five lineup was almost as good on defense (where it allowed just 98.0 points per 100 possessions) as it was on offense (where it scored 127.9). But OKC was the first top-10 defense (and just the second better-than-average defense) he\u2019s ever played for. The offense makes Gallinari a good fit on almost every good team in the league. He\u2019s one of four players \u2013 Davis Bertans (also a free agent), Bojan Bogdanovic and Joe Harris (another free agent) are the others \u2013 who have shot 40% or better on at least 300 3-point attempts in each of the last two seasons. But this year, there are no good teams with significant cap space. So if Gallinari wants to go somewhere where he can win a playoff series for the first time (he\u2019s played just 25 postseason games over 12 seasons in the league), he\u2019ll likely have to settle for the mid-level exception (starting at $9.3 million per year) or even the tax-payer\u2019s mid-level (starting at $5.7 million). Gallinari has indicated that competing for a championship is more important than the money. And if his offensive skills are available at a decent price, it\u2019s doubtful that any free agent will have more offers on the table. *** John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

That makes for a sticky situation for a Houston Rockets team in win-now mode with a new head coach, and few assets available to improve the roster with the start of the 2020-21 NBA season a little more than a month away from tip off. Earlier in the day on Wednesday, an ESPN report surfaced about Russell Westbrook and James Harden expressing concern about the direction of the franchise moving into the upcoming season. Hours later, Charania dropped the report that Westbrook has informed Houston officials that he\u2019s uneasy with the Rockets\u2019 accountability and culture, as well as a desire to return to a role similar to the floor general role he had over the first 11 years of his career in Oklahoma City. It\u2019s too early to tell what this might mean for new head coach Stephen Silas , who replaced Mike D\u2019Antoni on Oct. 28 as head coach of the Houston Rockets. While Charania and Kelly Iko reported that franchise centerpiece James Harden remains \u201clocked in\u201d for the upcoming season, it\u2019s clear that Silas could be navigating choppy waters in Houston before the season even starts. Interestingly, the most recent development doesn\u2019t quite jibe with the positive vibe Silas gave off last week when discussing the conversations he conducted with the two former MVPs during the interview process. \u201cI kind of gave them my vision as far as how I wanted to play, and how I wanted them to be able to use their greatness in a way that will help the team win,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThey were all about whatever\u2019s best for the team to win.\u201d Silas mentioned that his plan for the upcoming season involved \u201ctweaks\u201d but not wholesale changes to Houston\u2019s offensive system, which is heavily dependent on isolation with Harden. Harden and Westbrook led the NBA last season in isolation points, possession and frequency, and the Rockets ranked No. 1 in the league in isolation. In addition to hiring Silas, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta recently promoted longtime staffer Rafael Stone to the position of general manager. Stone made it clear last week that Houston remains committed to chasing titles with both Westbrook and Harden serving as centerpieces. Westbrook, who turns 32 on Thursday, is owed $131.5 million over the next three seasons with a $46.7 million option for the 2022-23 season. The 2016-17 MVP and nine-time All-Star, Westbrook struggled during the NBA restart after arriving late to the NBA bubble after contracting COVID-19. Westbrook also suffered a strained right quadriceps in August that further hindered his play. Harden, meanwhile, is also owed $131.5 million over the next three seasons with a $46.9 million player option in 2022-23. Complicating matters for Houston moving forward is its lack of assets to improve the roster. In a trade advocated for last summer by Harden, a childhood friend and former Thunder teammate, the Rockets acquired Westbrook in a deal in which they gave up their 2024 and 2026 first-round draft picks, in addition to handing OKC top-10-protected swap rights in the 2021 and 2025 drafts. Houston further depleted assets in February when it acquired forward Robert Covington by giving up this year\u2019s first-round pick and center Clint Capela. The Rockets\u2019 win-at-all-costs approach has led to few options when it comes to enhancing the roster, not to mention the club is also butting up against the luxury tax. Stone said last week that Fertitta is fine with spending into the luxury tax \u201cif spending results in winning.\u201d \u201cHe reiterated to me upon being hired that his priorities are winning first, second, and ad nauseum, and money, not so much,\u201d Stone said last week. But if forced to grant Westbrook\u2019s desire to leave Houston, things become much more complicated for a first-time head coach in Silas embarking on the upcoming season with little flexibility to improve the roster. Silas pointed out last week that \u201cyou have to have multiple ways of playing,\u201d which could entail \u201cpossibly having a bigger guy, a traditional type of center where you can roll to the rim, or duck in and do different things to where the matchups will be a little bit better and more traditional.\u201d Stone even mentioned a goal to \u201cprovide Stephen with a little more optionality.\u201d With Westbrook possibly out of the fold in Houston next season, the team certainly can acquire more flexibility, but the plans will likely change once again, while the franchise\u2019s commitment to chasing a third title remains. \u201cFor the last eight years or so, our goal has been to win a championship because we had James Harden,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got James Harden. Our goal is still to win a championship. If you\u2019ve got him, you\u2019re halfway there.\u201d We\u2019ll see. Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Daigneault becomes the first G League coach promoted to head coach within the same organization, but most importantly, his in-house advancement to the top of Oklahoma City\u2019s coaching ranks should smooth the transition for the franchise in the midst of a rebuild against an accelerated timeline with the 2020-21 season set to tip in a little more than a month. \u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about the quick turnaround time. I just interviewed with [general manager] Sam [Presti] and his group for a long period of time, and not once did they talk about the quick turnaround time,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cThe quick turnaround, shortened season, or whatever is just the world we live in right now, which is why I\u2019m so grateful to be in an organization with such a strong foundation like the Thunder.\u201d That underpinning stands to see several tests over the coming weeks, given all that\u2019s transpiring around Oklahoma City. ESPN reported Tuesday that the Phoenix Suns held discussions about acquiring All-Star Thunder point guard Chris Paul, with the league currently sitting through a moratorium on trades with the annual draft set for next week. Daigneault spoke with Paul on Wednesday morning, describing the veteran as \u201cso congratulatory\u201d of the coach\u2019s promotion. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to Chris, certainly,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to get back to work with not only Chris, but with everybody.\u201d Still, yet another challenge for OKC to address in the coming days is defining who \u201ceverybody\u201d is within the organization. Daigneault acknowledged the Thunder assistant coaching staff still isn\u2019t complete, and he declined to identify which coaches from the Donovan regime will be retained. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say anything is in place,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cSam just offered the job recently. So, nothing really is in place. We are in those conversations right now. I\u2019m not going to get into anything specific about the existing staff or any external people, but all I\u2019ll say is that I have a ton of confidence, respect and admiration for the coaching staff we that we have here and the people we have here. I fully anticipate that the first place we look for our next coaching staff is internal, and those conversations will be happening over the next few days.\u201d Then, there\u2019s the matter of the current Thunder roster, which remains uncertain with regards to Paul, who could be traded before the season as the team sits on a stockpile of draft picks from past trades. Remember that Donovan, now head coach of the Chicago Bulls, departed Oklahoma City, citing uncertainty about the franchise\u2019s future as one of the reasons. OKC\u2019s current roster features a few promising young players such as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who led the Thunder last season averaging 19 points per game. Lu Dort became a starter last season as a rookie and emerged as a lockdown defender in the playoffs while guarding Houston\u2019s James Harden. Darius Bazley also shined as a rookie last season, scoring in double figures on five occasions during OKC\u2019s eight seeding games played in the Walt Disney World bubble. Having spent five seasons as head coach of the Thunder\u2019s G League team, where rosters turn over in perpetuity, Daigneault expressed no concerns about the makeup of the current roster. Daigneault posted a winning percentage of .572 in the G League, capturing three division titles with the Blue, in addition to advancing to the playoffs on four occasions. \u201cThis is the modern NBA,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the NBA knows what their roster is gonna look like at a given point in time. There\u2019s times when the noise is a little louder, but I really can\u2019t get concerned with that. The job\u2019s hard enough to start engaging in hypotheticals. So, all I\u2019m thinking about is being extremely with the players that are on the team, and extremely present with the players that are in a Thunder uniform, whether they\u2019re in a Thunder uniform for years and years and years or whether they\u2019re on a 10-day contract. That\u2019s really all I can control, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m really focused on.\u201d Presti pointed out that Daigneault has \u201cbeen integrally involved with our draft process,\u201d adding that \u201cour player development systems have come significantly further and further each year under his purview.\u201d So, for the organization, the promotion of Daigneault to the head coaching role should only bolster what he\u2019s done over the years for the franchise. \u201cAs we reposition our franchise and our organization in an ever-changing, evolving NBA, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled about the traits that Mark brings to the table for us,\u201d Presti said. \u201cHe has had a significant impact in our organization over the last several years and has the rare combination of youth and experience. One of the greatest skills I think he possesses is his relatability to the modern NBA player, but also in a modern NBA organization. As we reposition our franchise for future sustainable success, we want to remain cutting edge, forward thinking, asking tough questions of ourselves and pushing ourselves forward. I can\u2019t think of someone better than Mark to be the person that\u2019s leading that charge from the coaching position and empowering all the different people that he works with, which I think is one of the greatest strengths that he has. He has had a hand in so many things that happen behind the scenes, including staff development of a lot of different coaches that he\u2019s had with the Blue that have gone on either to come to the Thunder or have moved on to different positions. I think that\u2019s a tremendous sign of his selfless leadership. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about his acumen, his toughness and his consistency as a coach on a day-to-day basis, but also the person that he is.\u201d Despite all the trade rumors, Paul remains under contract, along with Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Gilgeous-Alexander, Steven Adams, Dort and Bazley. Sharpshooter Danilo Gallinari is an unrestricted free agent as well as Devon Hall, Mike Muscala (player option), Nerlens Noel and Andre Roberson while Deonte Burton, Hamidou Diallo, Kevin Hervey and Abdel Nader comprise the club\u2019s restricted free agents. Daigneault laid out his list of priorities as the Thunder inch toward the start of a new season with just their fourth head coach since the franchise moved to Oklahoma City. Daigneault also expressed gratitude regarding the franchise\u2019s commitment to consistency, which should keep its most recent transition relatively pain-free. \u201cI reached out to all the players this morning and was able to talk to some of them,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cCertainly, staffing is a high priority coming into this, and then just continuing the conversation. The good thing for me is that the organization has been humming all this time, and all the people that have an impact on the organization have been working all the way through. We\u2019re ready for whatever comes our way always, and Dec. 1 is no exception to that. Going into the bubble experience, the players did a great job of keeping themselves ready. So, I have 100 percent confidence that when they come back in the doors, they\u2019re gonna be hungry and they\u2019re gonna be ready, in shape and ready to roll. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. But I\u2019m pretty confident because of all the people we have here.\u201d Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

On the jersey, \u201cBuzz City\u201d and the numbers appear in granite with gold outlines, while the name on the back is granite with no outline. The anthem decoration above the tag says \u201cCharlotte Hornets\u201d in granite, while the neck and arm openings are trimmed in granite and gold on the front of the jersey. Along with the continuation of the gold and granite pinstripes, the shorts feature a gold and granite version of the team\u2019s secondary logo on the outside of each leg. The waistband features a granite \u201cC\u201d in the official team font outlined in gold that is reminiscent of the \u201cC\u201d that appeared on coins from the Charlotte Mint, while the leg openings are trimmed in granite and gold like the jersey. Like all of the team\u2019s uniforms, the new City Edition features the logos of Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand on the right chest and partner LendingTree on the left chest. The Official Loan Shopping Partner of the Charlotte Hornets, LendingTree\u2019s logo will appear on each of the team\u2019s jerseys for the fourth consecutive season. As part of a robust sponsorship package, the company is also the entitlement partner for the Hornets App, a social media content series and the Hornets Hoops youth basketball program. As with the team\u2019s prior uniforms, the City Edition was designed in a multiyear collaboration between the Hornets, Nike\/Jordan Brand and the NBA\u2019s Global Merchandising Group.

That unconventional route to the NBA now has him set to be the top point guard taken \u2013 and maybe the first player overall \u2013 in the Nov. 18 draft. Ball, who most recently played in Australia, is the headliner at the position and is expected to be a top-four pick, and another American-born international prospect Killian Hayes and Iowa State\u2019s Tyrese Haliburton are likely top-10 selections. Here\u2019s a look at some of the top point guard prospects: The younger brother of New Orleans Pelicans point guard Lonzo Ball is projected by to have the draft\u2019s highest ceiling with his passing, ball skills and size. Strengths: The 19-year-old is bigger than most point guards with a 6-foot-7 frame, which will become even more of an advantage as he gets stronger. He started his overseas career in Lithuania in 2018 before eventually playing in Australia\u2019s National Basketball League, where he averaged 17 points, 7.4 rebounds and 6.8 assists in 12 games last season. That included consecutive triple-doubles of 32 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists followed by 25 points, 12 boards and 10 assists. Concerns: Ball can score in bunches \u2013 he scored 92 points in a California high school game in 2017 \u2014 but he didn\u2019t shoot the ball particularly well in the NBL (38% overall, 24% from 3-point range). That at least raises questions about his offensive efficiency, along with uncertainty about how good of a defender he will ultimately be even with his size and length. > Prospect Profile The 6-foot-5 Haliburton blossomed as a sophomore for the Cyclones into a lottery prospect. Strengths: Haliburton, 20, averaged 15.2 points and a Big 12-leading 6.5 assists before going down in February with a wrist injury. He\u2019s a confident floor leader who plays with energy, both as an unselfish distributor in setting up teammates but also as a scorer in transition or from outside (42.6% on 3-pointers in two seasons) even with an unorthodox stroke. He\u2019s also a good rebounder (5.9 last year). Concerns: Haliburton needs to add strength to a lean 175-pound frame, which would allow him to handle physical defenders or withstand contact in the paint. > Prospect Profile Hayes became a lottery prospect as a teenager in Europe. Strengths: The American-born Hayes has been developing in the professional ranks since he was 16, first in France. He later headed to Germany, where he said in a September predraft call with reporters: \u201cI really grew up as a leader on the court.\u201d The lefty has good size with a 6-foot-5, 192-pound frame, as well as overall polish in scoring off the dribble, whipping passes to set up teammates and the potential to play either guard spot. Concerns: Hayes needs to cut down mistakes with an assist-to-turnover ratio of 1.7 over three seasons overseas, which included 3.2 turnovers per game last year with a German club. He also shot just 29% on 3-pointers last season \u2014 although he was 39% in 10 higher-profile EuroCup games. Hayes said he is working to improve his defense, including against the pick-and-roll, and expand his right-handed game. > Prospect Profile The 20-year-old son of former UNLV and NBA point guard Greg Anthony started last year as a potential top-10 pick, but is likely to slide more to the middle or second half of the first round after a bumpy freshman year at North Carolina. Strengths: The 6-3, 190-pound Anthony is a tough-minded scorer. He started with 34 points against Notre Dame on the way to averaging 18.5 points while also being a willing rebounder (5.7). He returned from an 11-game absence due to knee surgery at a time when many questioned whether he should shut it down to protect his pro prospects. Concerns: Anthony was unable to elevate a UNC team unusually down on talent. He was the only player capable of consistently creating his own shot, yet the Tar Heels had trouble finding cohesion with Anthony\u2019s ball-dominant style as he shot 38%. UNC finished 14-19, the only losing record of Hall of Fame coach Roy Williams\u2019 career. > Prospect Profile"},{"id":412416,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-name-nate-mcmillan-assistant-coach","date":"2020-11-11","title":"Hawks name Nate McMillan assistant coach","content":"ATLANTA \u2013 The Atlanta Hawks today announced the hiring of Nate McMillan as an Assistant Coach on Head Coach Lloyd Pierce\u2019s staff.

Carroll is a 2015 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Carroll spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Brian Martin to discuss her military service, what inspired the formation of TAPS and the partnership between the NBA and TAPS to help support families who have lost a loved one.  Brian Martin: With Veterans Day approaching, can you discuss your decision to pursue a career in military service? Bonnie Carroll: I would love to. My mother had served in World War II as a pilot, an aviator. Hearing her stories from that time of how much it meant to her to serve her country, especially during war time, really just had such an impact on me. She died when I was a teenager, so I didn\u2019t really get to know her as an adult, but I cherish those stories and those memories and the few mementos that I have of her service. And that really inspired me to serve my country; she instilled in me that it was really every citizen\u2019s duty living in this wonderful free country to serve in whatever way they are able. So, I joined the Air National Guard, went off to basic training and then technical school and wound up spending a total of a little over 30 years in the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve, including some periods where I was full time with the Air Guard. Martin: When you look back at your service way, when you think about what you gave and what you got back, what was the biggest thing you took away from the experience? Carroll: Well, several things, the opportunity to really serve my country, to understand that the freedoms we enjoy in this country are fought for and hard won, and we can\u2019t take them for granted. That the American flag means something; I\u2019ll never forget our Basic Training graduation ceremony, hearing the National Anthem and saluting the American flag. It felt different, it made me feel more of a citizen and more engaged in our country. Of course, I love the camaraderie of the military. Some of the best friends that I\u2019ve had throughout my life have been ones that I\u2019ve met through that connection with the military. It was because of my service in the Air Guard, actually, that I wound up meeting my husband. Back in the late eighties, I was the only person working right there in the West Wing who was also a serving reservist. When a situation occurred surrounding gray whales that were trapped in the ice, President Reagan came to me and he said, \u201cSince you\u2019re in the Guard, and this is a National Guard led operation, could you take the lead and find out what\u2019s happening and how we can help?\u201d And the commander of the operation in Alaska was Colonel Tom Carroll. The rest is history, as they say. Martin: The whale rescue also inspired a movie. (The 2012 film Big Miracle covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska, and includes characters based on Bonnie and her husband.) What was it like to see yourself being portrayed in the film and see a part of your life story told on the big screen? Caroll: The rescue of those whales, back in the late eighties was such a wonderful example of groups coming together from polar opposite sides of every spectrum you could imagine; you had the Alaskan natives, the Federal government, oil companies, Greenpeace, the military, and then the Soviets all coming together for a common goal and really having the entire world cheering them on. My husband was such a global thinker and really did look at this operation as a way to not just rescue whales, but a fantastic opportunity to unite all of these groups. And he worked really hard at that throughout the operation. Martin: I wanted to talk to you about the inspiration and the formation of TAPS and how you turned a personal tragedy into a mission to help others. I know part of this story, but I would love to let our readers know the background of the story. Carroll: Well, very tragically, my husband, at the time he was the Commanding General of the Alaska Army National Guard, was killed, along with seven other soldiers, in an army plane crash in Alaska. At that time, I was in the Air National Guard and in my civilian job was actually working with organizations that helped those grieving traumatic loss, very ironically. Even in my National Guard service, I was working with a group doing a critical incident stress management following mass casualties. So, I\u2019d had this training and I had this moment after hearing of my husband\u2019s death, this immediate thought of, \u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019ve had all this training. I\u2019ll be able to help people. We\u2019ll get through this. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And I can tell you that that little fantasy lasted about 30 seconds before everything just seemed to stop and it was difficult to breathe. Life just completely came to a halt and it was really weeks and months before I could even start searching for the kind of support I knew had to exist for other types of loss. I knew what was out there based on the experiences I\u2019d had before, but when it\u2019s so personal, it just takes your breath away. And as many of our families say, it really knocks you to your knees. So, finding that while this support existed for firefighters and police and people who had lost a loved one to cancer or homicide or all sorts of other circumstances of loss, there wasn\u2019t a peer based emotional support group for the military. Because of my prior experience working in senior levels of government, I was able to go back and talk with senior leaders at the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and with all the other non-profit organizations working with military survivors, to really find out where the gaps were, what the needs were. I also talked to as many other survivors as I could find, especially reconnecting with those who had lost their husbands with mine. And out of all of that, in two years of really, really trying, just to heal myself and do the assessing, look at gaps, TAPS was finally created in 1994. The model for the foundation for TAPS were four core services that were not addressed anywhere else, but that would beautifully complement what the government offers. The government does a wonderful job of rendering final honors, providing that final resting place, and administering the financial benefits for eligible beneficiaries. But then really it\u2019s up to us, the surviving families, to help each other heal, to give each other the emotional support that only another bereaved person can in this unique military family. We also recognized right away that one of the big needs was 24\/7 support because grief is hardest at two in the morning, not two in the afternoon. It\u2019s not nine to five, Monday through Friday; it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day. It\u2019s really those very lonely dark hours that for many of our families don\u2019t seem survivable. We also added in casework to help survivors navigate all of the complex paperwork and entitlements and other necessary support surrounding a death. And then the fourth core service that TAPS offers is connecting families with the grief support that is already there in their local community; giving them that safe, soft landing place to go right there where they live, at a time when they just wouldn\u2019t have the energy to find it themselves. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s how TAPS came to be. And now we have wonderful relationships with our partner non-profits, we have great relationships and collaborations with the membership associations, like Gold Star Wives, Society of Military Widows, Gold Star Mothers, and we all worked together to really dovetail and complement care for all those grieving the death of a military loved one. Martin: How challenging has it been to provide the service you do to these families during the pandemic? Obviously, military losses don\u2019t stop because we\u2019re in a pandemic, so there are more people that need your help. What adjustments have you had to make to maintain the level of work that you want to do during this time? Carroll: Actually, right now we are receiving more bereaved military family members than we ever have, even at the height of the war. We have family members who are coming to us from communities across this country at a rate of, on average, 21 new surviving family members every day. That will go beyond 7,000 this year, the most that we\u2019ve ever had come to us in a single year. And these are moms and dads, brothers and sisters, widows, children, all grieving someone whose life included service to our country, and whose death was during or connected to that service. Right now we\u2019re seeing the majority of those newly bereaved have actually lost loved ones to suicide or illnesses or to an accident; it\u2019s a small percentage that are losing their loved ones to hostile action. But for our families, it doesn\u2019t matter how or where the death occurred. It\u2019s all about the life lived and the service given to this country. So that\u2019s what we do \u2013 we honor and we remember all those who have served and died. In terms of how our delivery of care shifted, to be honest, when the families come to us, the initial connection is usually by phone, by text, maybe by video chat, by whatever means is best and most comfortable for the family, but it\u2019s happening right there in their home. We have a wonderful team; we have nearly a hundred folks who are working for TAPS. Most of them are what we call peer professionals, meaning they\u2019re survivors themselves, or military family members, and so they really understand grief and loss. But they\u2019re connecting with surviving families where they need it, when they need it. And that hasn\u2019t changed in the pandemic. We\u2019re still doing it that way. The only thing that really has shifted are the in-person events that we would have been doing throughout the year. The \u201cGood Grief Camps\u201d and the adult survivor seminars, those have shifted to a virtual platform. But you know what? We are now able to offer those virtual programs to even a bigger group of people. We\u2019ve learned a lot. As one surviving mom told me the other day, she said \u201cI probably never would have been able to travel and go to this event.\u201d But she said, \u201cTAPS came right into my living room, and here you are. And I can now attend every event, not just the ones that would have been near me.\u201d I love that. Martin: How did TAPS and the NBA first connect and how has the partnership grown over the years to help support military families who had lost a loved one? Carroll: We\u2019re very fortunate that retired General Martin Dempsey, USA (18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) is on our board of directors and Bob Delaney, former NBA vice president for referee\u2019s development and performance, is on our honorary board. Both of them have been wonderful about making tremendous connections for us with the NBA. One of the great programs that we are part of is an association with the referees via the National Basketball Referee Association. I remember the referees, and either Bob [Delaney] or Scott Foster, took a TAPS family to a game and it was such a powerful experience for these kids to feel special, to feel seen and heard, and their loved one to be honored and remembered. That got shared with other refs and it just became this wonderful program. Then we were able to go for a couple of years to the referees\u2019 annual meeting, and really bond and have a chance to share that service, that sacrifice and, and have a lot of fun. So that was one part of the program. And then through General Dempsey connecting TAPS with USA Basketball, and now with Kim Bohuny [Senior Vice President, Basketball Operations-International, NBA] and the international programs, we\u2019ve been able to connect surviving families all over the world with USAB, the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s National teams, and the Jr. NBA. It\u2019s just grown into this wonderful relationship that just keeps building. Martin: I\u2019m sure there are plenty of amazing stories from some of the experiences the military families have had with NBA players and officials. Can you share a few with us? [Note: Diana Hosford \u2013 Vice President, Sports and Entertainment at TAPS joined to add some additional details.] Carroll: What\u2019s so magical about the relationship with TAPS and the NBA is that it\u2019s coming at all different levels. We engage with the referees and that is really up close and personal with them. We\u2019re in the referee locker rooms prior to the game and survivors have really meaningful experiences and then they sit in the ref seats during the game, and we ended up watching what they call the \u201cthird team.\u201d We\u2019re excited because we\u2019re watching a professional basketball game, but also watching these referees that we\u2019ve just met, and telling the fans not to yell and scream at them because they\u2019re our new friends. So it\u2019s this really lovely connection that we\u2019ve been able to make there and also at the club level, we\u2019ve done some really, really wonderful things. The second team that we ever welcomed into our sports program (teams4taps) was the Washington Wizards and they continue to engage in really meaningful ways. [Wizards General Manager] Tommy Shepherd has been wonderful, not only during the season, but also for our TAPS National Military Survivor Seminar in Washington, DC, over Memorial Day Weekend, helping to provide basketball hoops and even loaning us their practice facility when NBA international and NBA Cares bring, NBA\/WNBA players and coaches to our national seminar to engage more than 500 military surviving children in drills and practices and tips. And it\u2019s always a fantastic experience. We\u2019ve gone to games and have been hosted by clubs including WNBA and NBA G League. There have been players who\u2019ve taken our kids to go shopping at the NBA Store. We have been invited to four NBA All-Star weekends. We\u2019ve had TAPS kids participate in the NBA Draft. It\u2019s an engaging experience because we\u2019re involved at every level. The league has welcomed families in so many fantastic ways that we really do feel like part of the NBA family. I mean any arena we go to, anywhere in America, it feels like home. We\u2019re currently doing an NBA operations program where we have the directors of scouting from a few different teams, come and meet with families every few weeks. To engage them, answer questions, talk about what it\u2019s like to work behind the scenes. We even did a 2020 NBA mock Draft, which was fantastic. And being able to do that virtually with our families across the country, who are really into basketball and really excited about. One surviving mom on a call that we did with the NBA operations team said, \u201cthis is the highlight of my week.\u201d One of my favorite stories involves a young 10-year-old, he and his brother attended a Wizards game with Scott Foster. The boy was saying how Bradley Beal was his favorite player, so Scott motioned and then Bradley came over and immediately the young boy starts giving Bradley some pointers. And the look on Bradley Beal\u2019s face when this little military kid is telling him, you know, \u201cI think you should do this and that\u201d was just priceless. Then Bradley takes the kid on court during warmups to shoot some hoops with him. He is playing with this little boy and made sure that he got to make a basket, and I\u2019m telling you it was an amazing moment. And I will tell you, five years later, that same kid is on those NBA operations calls and in the mock draft. I was in his Zoom room; that kid knows his basketball! Another experience I want to highlight; we were so pleased to have Kevin Love join us for our Virtual National Military Suicide Survivor Seminar last month. He spoke about his challenges with his mental wellness and mental health and being an advocate. He spoke so passionately, and I know that the survivors attending really thought he was a wonderful addition to the event. And I think gave people license because a lot of times when athletes or celebrities open up, or even surviving families opening up, it gives other people license to share that they didn\u2019t have before. Martin: You\u2019ve dedicated your career to supporting grieving families and by doing that, you\u2019re surrounded by so much loss and so many people that are grieving. Is it hard at times to keep a positive attitude and spirit or do these experiences and these things that you see is that what brings the joy? Carroll: Absolutely. A lot of people ask that about, \u201cGosh, isn\u2019t it tough working with grief and the pain of, you know, this awful loss?\u201d But what I hear talking to families and what we see through these NBA engagements is pride, it\u2019s love. And we always say at TAPS, the person has physically left us, but the love goes on forever. We never stopped loving that person. You never stopped honoring who they were and that their life included service to this country. And what we\u2019re able to create for the families is a place to celebrate that, to be joyous and to share their story with the players, with the referees and, sometimes with an entire venue when their loved one is up on a Jumbotron and their story is shared. It\u2019s what\u2019s best about America. It\u2019s so powerful, such a beautiful connection that I hope people will understand the depth of the impact that the NBA has had on the families of our nation\u2019s fallen heroes. Martin: I don\u2019t ever really get a chance to speak with a winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Can you take me back to that moment in 2015 and discuss the emotion that goes through you when you\u2019re presented with such an honor? Carroll: President Obama awarded the Medal to me in a recognition of American service and sacrifice. We worked so closely with him as Commander-in-Chief, throughout some of the toughest years of the war and our military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. And he felt every loss so personally, so he truly understood the impact of the work TAPS was quietly doing behind the scenes to offer comfort and support, to recognize all those who served and died. What meant the most to me was the fact that our families, all across the country, started taking selfies of themselves with the TV on in the background when he was presenting the Medal and really claiming it as theirs as well and posting their pictures on social media. It was their award as well, and that\u2019s what meant the most to me."},{"id":412131,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/knicks-shut-training-center-after-positive-tests","date":"2020-11-11","title":"Knicks shut training center after positive tests","content":"The New York Knicks have temporarily closed their training facility after three team employees tested positive for the coronavirus.

Everybody 20 or over knows Tommy as a broadcaster. And everybody 10 or under thinks he\u2019s Shrek.\u201d Throwing 10 more years on that pile clinched it, the number of people growing exponentially who thought of Heinsohn \u2013 who died Tuesday at age 86 \u2013 as the boisterous, lovable color man for his beloved Celtics. He was your loud, funny stool neighbor at the corner tavern, your let-\u2018er-rip uncle in the family room, Fred Flintstone as a hoops maven. He doled out \u201cTommy Points\u201d for hustle plays, hollered about referees as if he worked at DraftKings, and turned a journeyman center who averaged 5.7 points and 2.8 rebounds in his eight years in Boston, Walter McCarty, into his signature call and personal mascot. \u201cI love Waltah !\u201d Heinsohn would shout, a rallying cry that echoed well beyond McCarty\u2019s departure from the Celtics in 2005. The man\u2019s career as a basketball broadcaster lasted more than twice as long as his work as either an NBA player (1956-65) or the Celtics head coach (1969-1978). So yeah, it\u2019s understandable that a couple generations of fans don\u2019t know much about Heinsohn in those earlier gigs. But just as some people know Charles Barkley only for his outrageous remarks on TNT\u2019s studio set or Tom Selleck as an old guy hawking reverse mortgages, those familiar only with Heinsohn in a headset miss arguably the most impressive chapters in his NBA career. Consider: Heinsohn is one of only four people enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice \u2013 as a player in 1986 and as a coach in 2015. Bill Sharman, John Wooden and Lenny Wilkens are the others. Even his legendary Celtics teammate Bill Russell can\u2019t say he participated in the Finals every year of his career, but Heinsohn can. Boston won eight of those nine, with the 6-foot-7 gunner from Union City, N.J., averaging 18.6 points and 8.8 rebounds before having to retire at age 30 due to a nagging foot injury. A six-time All-Star and the 1957 Rookie of the Year, Heinsohn earned the nickname \u201cAck-Ack\u201d for his propensity to shoot the ball. He averaged 18 field-goal attempts per game, happily slipping into the scorer role while Bob Cousy handled playmaking and Russell reigned as defender and rebounder. A territorial pick from Holy Cross tucked away by Red Auerbach two spots before the Celtics took Russell in the 1956 Draft, Heinsohn \u201cwas as exciting offensively as Russell was defensively,\u201d according to sportswriter Leonard Koppett in his 1968 book, \u201c24 Seconds to Shoot.\u201d Russell\u2019s rookie season was delayed when he participated in the Olympics, giving Heinsohn time to settle into his role. For years, Russell would tease his teammate that he owed him half of that ROY award for starting late. Hall of Famer Sam Jones told the Boston Globe about Heinsohn the player: \u201cWe knew that when he got the ball, he was gong to shoot it. \u2026 I remember going up for a layup, there\u2019s no one around me for 10 feet but Tommy, and he was calling for the ball.\u201d Auerbach was said to use Heinsohn as a whipping boy, making points to the whole team by directing his ire at him. The partnership wasn\u2019t without friction but it paid off big when Heinsohn put up 37 points and 23 rebounds in Game 7 of the 1957 Finals against St. Louis. He hadn\u2019t just carried the Celtics to their first title ever \u2013 he had sparked the dynasty that followed. As a player, Heinsohn had a pivotal role, too, in leading the NBA players union from its roots under Cousy. He was instrumental in the near-boycott of the 1964 All-Star Game in Boston, when players refused to participate until they got assurances from the owners on issues related to training, facilities and pension considerations. Heinsohn began his broadcasting career after retiring after the 1964-65 season. After working both college and Celtics games, he expressed interest in the coaching job when Russell stepped down as player-coach in 1969. Boston\u2019s talent cupboard was relatively bare, compared to the dynastic years when it won 11 of 13 championships under Auerbach (nine) and Russell (two). So Heinsohn pushed for an up-tempo style built around wing John Havlicek and undersized center Dave Cowens. They improved from 34 to 44 to 56 to 68 victories in his first four seasons on the bench, Heinsohn earning Coach of the Year honors in 1973. In 1974 and 1976, they added two more rings to the franchise\u2019s now-total of 17. Heinsohn was fired with an 11-23 record in January 1978, a few months before Auerbach drafted Larry Bird. He posted a 427-263 mark, with a .619 winning percentage that still ranks 19 th in league history (and seventh among coaches who worked at least 500 games). Beyond the pace at which he liked his teams to play, Heinsohn was best known for his bellowing sideline antics involving referees, a trait he later brought to his announcing. \u201cThe best thing you can say about an official,\u201d Heinsohn said, \u201cis to say nothing. When guys are doing a great job, you don\u2019t hear me say anything. When I think somebody is really not doing the job, I kinda mention it in some way, shape or form.\u201d There was one other aspect of Heinsohn\u2019s basketball style, player and coach, that he carried with him into broadcasting, crafted over his 64-year affiliation with the Celtics. As former Boston coach Doc Rivers said of him, \u201cTommy has more love for a team than any human being I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He was 86. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine the Boston Celtics without Tommy Heinsohn. There isn\u2019t a generation of Celtics fans for whom Tommy\u2019s presence hasn\u2019t been felt,\u201d the Celtics said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon. \u201cHe is the only person to be an active participant in each of the Celtics\u2019 17 World Championships, an extraordinary and singular legacy. \u201cFor all of his accomplishments as a player, coach, and broadcaster, it is Tommy\u2019s rich personality that defined the man. A loving father, grandfather, and husband. A talented painter and a lively golf partner. Unofficial mentor to decades of Celtics coaches and players. A frequent constructive critic of referees. Originator of the most \u201cCeltic stat\u201d of them all, The Tommy Point. And a boundless love for all things Boston Celtics, a passion which he shared with fans over 64 years. We take this time to celebrate his life and legacy, and to share in the sorrow of his passing with his family, friends, and fans. As long as there are the Boston Celtics, Tommy\u2019s spirit will remain alive.\u201d Known for his hard-nosed style of play, yet possessing a superb shooting touch and good body control, Heinsohn was a vital cog in the Boston Celtics\u2019 dynasty of the 1950s and 1960s. Chosen as NBA Rookie of the Year in 1957, he helped the Celtics win eight NBA titles during his nine-year tenure, was named to the All-NBA Second Team for four years, and was an All-Star for six. As an NBA coach, Heinsohn led the Celtics to NBA titles in 1974 and \u201976 and amassed a 427-263 record in eight-plus seasons in Boston. The Celtics made the playoffs in six of his seasons and made the conference finals in five of those six seasons. Since retiring, he has served as an analyst for basketball on both the national and regional level, endearing himself to Celtics fans for his unique flair and calls during Boston\u2019s games. In 2015, he became the fourth person ever enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both a coach and player after Heinsohn coached the team to two titles in the 1970s and was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1973. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver released the following statement regarding the passing of Heinsohn. \u201cTommy Heinsohn\u2019s remarkable contributions to our game bridged generations and personified the Boston Celtics for more than 60 years. He was synonymous with success, winning eight NBA championships in nine seasons with Boston as a player and two more as its coach, which led to his rare distinction of Hall of Fame status in both capacities. Tommy was equally renowned as an NBA broadcaster who made his mark on both the national and local stage. Celtics games will not be the same without Tommy, and he will be dearly missed by those who share his fervor for basketball. We extend our deepest sympathies to Tommy\u2019s family, his friends and the Celtics organization.\u201d The contributions extended beyond basketball to business. The National Basketball Players Association called Heinsohn one of its \u201cfounding fathers,\u201d saying it would not be here \u201cwithout his commitment and passion for players\u2019 rights and for that, we are forever grateful.\u201d \u201cNot only did Tommy have an incredible career in the NBA as a player, coach and broadcaster, but closer to our home, he was instrumental in creating our union, taking the baton from his friend and teammate Bob Cousy and serving as our President from 1958-66,\u201d the NBPA added. \u201cTommy was truly a pioneer in player empowerment, championing the notion of free agency at a time when it was highly controversial and unpopular, and fighting to create our NBA Players\u2019 Pension Plan, under which generations of players have thrived.\u201d NBA players, coaches and members of the media expressed their condolences on social media in the wake of Heinsohn\u2019s passing. Averaging 18.6 ppg in 654 regular-season games, he was a versatile scorer as a player but was often overshadowed by such illustrious teammates as Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman and Bill Russell. After turning in his jersey in 1965, Heinsohn coached the Celtics to two more world championships and was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986. Born and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey, just across the river from New York City, Heinsohn attended Saint Paul of the Cross school through the fifth grade. Then his family moved to nearby Union City, New Jersey, and he was introduced to basketball while attending sixth grade at Saint Joseph\u2019s. After a standout career at St. Michael\u2019s High School, he opted to attend Holy Cross College, where he pumped in 23.3 ppg in his junior year and as a senior he set a Holy Cross scoring record by averaging 27.4 ppg. Named to almost every All-America team, he also made the dean\u2019s list for scholastic excellence in his last four semesters. The Celtics claimed Heinsohn as a territorial pick in the 1956 NBA Draft, the same year that Boston coach Red Auerbach worked a deal with the St. Louis Hawks for the rights to a rookie named Bill Russell. Auerbach was impressed with Russell\u2019s potential, but he wasn\u2019t particularly optimistic about Heinsohn\u2019s chances of making the team. Heinsohn responded by flying to Illinois to look into the possibility of playing amateur ball for a national industrial league. If Cousy hadn\u2019t advised the youngster to stick with Boston, Heinsohn might never have played in the NBA. As if to prove Auerbach wrong, Heinsohn had a sensational rookie year with the Celtics. A slender but tough forward with exceptional agility, he averaged 16.2 ppg and played almost 30 minutes per contest. His jump shot had a flat trajectory that made the ball look as though it were attached to a string, and he shot often, with a quick release. Russell missed the first 24 games of the 1956-57 season while helping the United States to a gold medal at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, so Heinsohn claimed the inside track in the race for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Boston\u2019s two outstanding newcomers combined with the legendary backcourt duo of Sharman and Cousy to forge the best record in the NBA at 44-28. The Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals, in which they met the St. Louis Hawks and Bob Pettit. The series was decided in a memorable Game 7. Heinsohn\u2019s 37 points helped the Celtics to a thrilling 125-123 double-overtime victory that earned Boston its first NBA championship. Boston won eight consecutive championships from 1959 through 1966, and Heinsohn was a part of seven of them. He led the Celtics in scoring three times during those years, made six All-Star appearances, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team four times. He had his finest offensive season in 1961-62, when he averaged 22.1 ppg. Heinsohn\u2019s deadliest shot was a long-range jumper that he liked to launch from the corners and from beyond the head of the key. He also boasted a righthanded hook shot that he lofted from the 5- to 15-foot range, a short-range lefthanded hook, a one-handed set shot and several types of driving layups. The 1964-65 season was Heinsohn\u2019s last. His point production had fallen every year since his career high of 22.1 ppg in 1961-62. Missing 13 games because of injuries in 1964-65, he slipped to just 13.6 ppg, the lowest mark of his career. Yet the Celtics earned the NBA\u2019s best record at 62-18 and beat Los Angeles in five games in the NBA Finals. It was Boston\u2019s seventh consecutive championship and the eighth in Heinsohn\u2019s nine seasons. Three years later, after Russell had retired, Auerbach offered the post to Heinsohn again. This time Heinsohn said yes. He had a monumental job ahead of him. With no experience as a coach, Heinsohn was supposed to create a team that could carry on the winning ways Boston fans had grown to expect without the services of the greatest defensive center the game had ever seen, and with one of the greatest coaches of all time scrutinizing his every move. \u201cIt was pure trauma,\u201d Heinsohn recalled. In Heinsohn\u2019s rookie season as coach, 1969-70, the Celtics won 34 games and lost 48, marking the first time in almost 20 years that Boston had posted a losing record. During the offseason the Celtics drafted Dave Cowens from Florida State. At the start of the next season, Heinsohn assigned the 6-9 Cowens to play center despite his relatively short stature. Don Chaney, only 6-5, played forward. Jo Jo White was a quick, slashing guard who ran the fast breaks. The team started to jell, winning 44 games and losing 38 in 1970-71. Later, Heinsohn reflected that this was one of his most satisfying seasons at the helm, as the Celtics won with a simple, effective game plan \u2014 run the fast break and use only three plays. The following year Boston fared even better, posting a 56-26 record and making the playoffs for the first time in two years. The Celtics began to steamroll in 1972-73, racking up the best record in the NBA at 68-14, including a 32-8 showing on the road, the second-best mark of all time. Their .829 winning percentage overall was the third highest ever. But New York derailed Boston\u2019s fast break in the Eastern Conference finals, beating the Celtics in seven games. Though denied another championship ring by the Knicks, Heinsohn did win NBA Coach of the Year honors. After a solid 56-26 regular season in 1973-74, the stage was set for the Celtics\u2019 first NBA Finals appearance since 1968-69. Their opponents, the Milwaukee Bucks with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, were favored to win. But the shorter Cowens capitalized on his quickness and determination, proving that a championship team didn\u2019t need a big man in the middle. In the climactic seventh game in Milwaukee, Cowens scored 28 points and snatched 14 rebounds to push Boston to a 102-87 win. The victory was an affirmation of Heinsohn\u2019s coaching ideas. In what he called \u201cguerrilla warfare,\u201d his teams kept the pressure on opponents at all times, controlling the tempo of the game and playing with great intensity. \u201cWe made teams crack in these playoffs,\u201d he told the Boston Globe. \u201cWe got them to points in big games in the fourth quarter where they just didn\u2019t want to play anymore.\u201d The Celtics regained the championship in 1975-76. During Heinsohn\u2019s eight full seasons as coach, Boston won five Eastern Division titles in a row, took two NBA championships and compiled a 416-240 record. At the start of the 1977-78 season, with the Celtics at 11-23, Heinsohn stepped down. Since retiring from the NBA, Heinsohn has done basketball commentary for television, has run a life insurance company and has indulged his lifelong passion for fine-arts painting. He was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1995 Heinsohn received the Jack McMahon Award, given annually by the National Basketball Coaches Association (NBCA) to an individual who has made a special contribution to the NBA coaching profession. Younger generations of fans came to love him through his commentary, whether calling it straight for CBS while working the NBA Finals in the 1980s, or with his Celtics bias sprinkled in during his years alongside Mike Gorman for local coverage. \u201cRoughly 2800 times I sat down with Tommy to broadcast a game. Every time it was special,\u201d Gorman wrote on Twitter. \u201cHOF player\u2026HOF coach\u2026HOF partner. Celtics Nation has lost its finest voice. Rest In Peace my friend. It has been the privilege of my professional life to be the Mike in Mike & Tommy.\u201d \u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"id":411714,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/will-late-lottery-teams-be-the-real-winners-of-the-draft","date":"2020-11-10","title":"Will late lottery teams be the real winners of the Draft?","content":"It\u2019s natural to ponder the point of participation in the NBA Draft Lottery when the results don\u2019t yield picks near the top of the order, but we\u2019ve learned over the years that positivity quietly brews for the squads picking up the rear. Case in point: the Miami Heat, which grinded to the 2020 NBA Finals behind the contributions of a pair of players chosen among the final four picks of the lottery in Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro. Over the last six years alone, picks No. 11 through 14 brought us: Interestingly, teams took players that attended the same schools in the 11 to 14 range in seven of the last 10 NBA drafts with a pair of Kentucky teammates being selected on three occasions (2015, \u201917 and \u201919). This year, San Antonio, Sacramento, New Orleans and Boston own picks 11 through 14. \u201cWe want to be competitive in there here and now,\u201d said David Griffin, Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations on a Nov. 4 conference call with the team\u2019s season ticket holders. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re very mindful that sustained success means you keep your salary structure such that you can continue to add pieces. When it\u2019s really time to hit the gas and make a run at being special-good, you have the flexibility to add those pieces.\u201d As Miami showed us, that first step takes place with the Draft. So, let\u2019s take a look at some of the needs of the teams picking 11 th through 14 th as well as some of the players that could potentially fill them once it all commences on Nov. 18 at the 2020 NBA Draft. It\u2019s quiet in San Antonio and it\u2019s likely because the Spurs own a unique opportunity at No. 11 with their first lottery pick since 1997, when they took Tim Duncan No. 1 overall. ESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe recently discussed hearing some buzz about Golden State trading the No. 2 pick to San Antonio for LaMarcus Aldridge and the 11 th pick, but on the surface that seems unlikely since the Warriors would have to send so much back in salary to make it work. That doesn\u2019t mean San Antonio \u2014 which saw its 22-year playoff streak come to an end this season \u2014 isn\u2019t working behind the scenes to try to swing a deal to move up in the Draft. If San Antonio stands pat, the Draft board should still feature plenty of prospects at No. 11 capable of helping quickly such as Florida State\u2019s Patrick Williams , Villanova\u2019s Saddiq Bey or Kentucky\u2019s Tyrese Maxey . The Spurs already have plenty of promising young guards in Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Lonnie Walker IV, and could benefit from adding a young wing such as Williams or Bey. San Antonio will surely be intrigued by Bey\u2019s shooting ability (45.1% from 3-point range last season) and versatility on offense and defense, where he can guard multiple positions. Williams isn\u2019t as effective as Bey offensively, but his versatility to play the three and four and his upside defensively might tempt the Spurs. Maxey, meanwhile, is a homegrown Texas product with a two-way combo guard skillset. It\u2019s concerning he shot just 29.2% from deep at Kentucky, but let\u2019s not forget San Antonio has one of the league\u2019s best shooting coaches in Chip Engelland, who played a major role in Kawhi Leonard\u2019s development as a shooter.  It\u2019s difficult to figure out which way Sacramento might be leaning after bringing in Monte McNair back in September to take over as general manager. McNair worked in the Houston Rockets\u2019 organization for 13 years prior to taking the job in Sacramento, and if you combine his past experience with the personnel currently on hand, you can bet the Kings will be looking to run the floor this season with centerpiece De\u2019Aaron Fox leading the way. Bey and Williams make sense in this spot if they\u2019re still available, as well as Vanderbilt\u2019s Aaron Nesmith and Memphis\u2019 Precious Achiuwa . Alabama\u2019s Kira Lewis Jr. has also been generating some buzz to the Kings at 12, but his skillset, from this vantage point, seems too similar to Fox\u2019s. McNair has said he wants the Kings to \u201cplay fast and space the floor,\u201d and although Lewis possesses Fox\u2019s speed and scoring ability, you have to wonder whether he\u2019ll be ready to contribute immediately, given his size (165 pounds). Nesmith is one of the best shooters of this Draft class, which would give Fox more passing options. Nesmith also possesses a wingspan of nearly 7-feet, which would only benefit him down the road as a two-way player. Achiuwa also makes sense for a team looking to run. He can play the center spot in smaller lineups, defend both forward spots, and can switch onto guards. Achiuwa could turn out to be an immediate contributor as a defender.  The Pelicans underachieved for sure in the bubble, but the truth is this is probably already a playoff team next season without a major infusion of talent through the Draft. This team drips with talent in Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram (last season\u2019s Kia Most Improved Player), Lonzo Ball and last year\u2019s No. 1 pick, Zion Williamson. This team also has 2019 lottery pick Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, the No. 17 pick of the 2019 draft. But New Orleans ranked 29 th in turnovers and 28 th in opponent fast-break points, finishing last season No. 21 in defensive rating (111.6). The Pelicans\u2019 hiring of defensive-minded Stan Van Gundy as coach should go a long way towards fixing most of what ailed them last season. A smart pick at No. 13 would likely only bolster depth. New Orleans could benefit tremendously from Nesmith\u2019s shooting, as he knocked down 52.2% from deep last season, and he\u2019ll improve defensively working with Van Gundy. Achiuwa, meanwhile, could provide depth in the frontcourt and possibly serve as an athletic complement to Williamson. Maryland\u2019s Jalen Smith could be a fit here, too, given the big man\u2019s 3-point shooting ability (36.8% last season); especially if the Pelicans decide to trade back toward the bottom of the round. In addition to the 13 th pick, the Pelicans own a trio of second-round picks (39, 43 and 60) they could use as currency to maneuver how they choose.  The only team in this Draft with three first-round picks, the Celtics surely realize they won\u2019t have enough minutes to play three rookies next season. Besides that, Boston\u2019s roster is pretty solid in most spots. So, the logical move would be to try to trade one of the picks or a couple to move up the board for a prospect they covet. If the Celtics can\u2019t find a trade partner to move up, they\u2019ll be lucky if Achiuwa is still there at No. 14 as a potential backup for center Daniel Theis that would eventually move into the starting lineup. Remember what Adebayo did to the Celtics in the conference finals? With a 7-foot-2 wingspan, Achiuwa is regarded as a high-motor player with an aggressive mentality that could help Boston immediately as a defender and especially as a shot blocker. Some mock drafts have projected North Carolina freshman guard Cole Anthony to the Celtics at 14. Anthony is a confident player with NBA pedigree as the son of Greg Anthony. Coming off a knee injury, Anthony could step in as the primary backup point guard behind Kemba Walker. Bey fits here, too, given his NBA readiness and the fact he could provide wing depth for a Celtics squad that was thin there at points last season. Arizona\u2019s Josh Green appears to be an ideal fit as a 3-and-D specialist for Boston as well, but he\u2019ll probably still be around when the Celtics pick again at No. 30. * * * Michael C.

The teams says the overall uniform design is inspired by the \u201cone-of-a-kind Philadelphia view Boathouse Row provides at night.\u201d Following the United States\u2019 bicentennial, each boathouse was lined with lights in the late 1970s, which reflect each evening on the river, creating the visual mimicked on the uniform. Sixers star guard Ben Simmons had a hand in designing the new City Edition uniforms. The Sixers say Simmons asked Chris Heck, the team\u2019s president, to develop a black uniform. Heck offered Simmons a deal: win 2017-18 Kia Rookie of the Year and he\u2019d be included in the uniform-design process. Simmons did exactly that in 2017-18 and became \u201can integral part of the design\u2019s development,\u201d the team says. \u201cWe love telling stories through the 76ers brand, specifically of our great city and always honoring our history,\u201d Heck said in a statement released by the team. \u201cThis year, we celebrate our city edition uniform by blending the old and the new specifically for the greatest fans in the world to enjoy.\u201d"},{"id":411491,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/its-done-the-nba-comes-back-on-dec-22-a-72-game-season","date":"2020-11-10","title":"It's done: The NBA comes back on Dec. 22, a 72-game season","content":"It\u2019s official: The NBA is coming back Dec. 22. The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced Monday night that they\u2019ve struck a deal on rules for this coming season, setting the stage for what will be a frenzied few weeks before games resume. Teams will play a 72-game schedule, which will be revealed in the coming weeks. The league said a new system will be used to ensure that the split of basketball-related income continues, one of the many details that had to be collectively bargained with the union because the current agreement between the sides had a great deal of language that needed reworking because of the coronavirus pandemic. Negotiations with free agents will be allowed to begin at 6 p.m. on Nov. 20, with signings permitted starting at 12:01 p.m. on Nov. 22 \u2014 an extraordinarily fast window for the NBA, which typically has about a week spanning the start of talks and the beginning of signings. But with training camps this year beginning Dec. 1, both sides evidently feel there isn\u2019t a need to draw out the process any longer than necessary. Many rosters could be considerably reshaped by then, with trades likely to be permissible again in the coming days \u2014 the exact details there still being worked out \u2014 and the NBA draft set to take place Nov. 18. Player and team options likely will be settled around that same time. Free agency starts two days after the draft, with around 100 players set for unrestricted status. The salary cap and tax level will remain unchanged. The cap was $109.14 million this past season, with the tax level at $132,627,000. The real numbers will be affected by the shortened schedule \u2014 last year\u2019s numbers were based on the standard 82-game season, a threshold that won\u2019t be reached this year. The salary cap for 2021-22 is guaranteed to rise somewhere between 3% and 10%, the league said, which means it\u2019ll be somewhere between $112.4 million and $120.1 million. The league\u2019s board of governors will vote to finalize the deal, which is a formality. NBA general managers also have a meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss matters. Meyers Leonard, a free-agent-to-be who spent this past season with the Miami Heat and served as the team\u2019s player rep to the NBPA, said he had some concerns about getting all the logistical matters completed in time for a Dec. 22 opening night. He resumed his offseason workouts Monday after he and his wife took a 4,000-mile tour-bus trip arranged by Coors Light from Miami to Los Angeles with many stops along the way. \u201cWithout knowing all the ins and outs, Dec. 22nd, from a money standpoint, you play more games, you play your Christmas games, it probably makes sense,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of logistical things that I know cannot be easy. And the discussions that are being had are very dynamic and very difficult conversations.\u201d There are countless other issues to work out, such as all the health and safety protocols now that games won\u2019t be played in the safety of a bubble and teams will be traveling to various cities once again. Players were tested daily in the bubble, and nobody tested positive because of the very strict protocols. It\u2019ll be much tougher to avoid a COVID-related issue with the league back to some sort of normalcy this season. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people testing positive,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about left and right, but it\u2019s going to happen. And then what happens? It\u2019s a tough time we\u2019re all dealing with. The disease is very strange. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the league rolls with the punches, so to speak.\u201d For the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers and Eastern Conference champion Heat, it will be the shortest offseason in NBA history \u2014 with seven weeks separating the end of the NBA Finals and the planned Dec. 1 start of training camp. But for the eight teams that didn\u2019t make the restart bubble at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida this summer, it has been a marathon offseason, with none of those teams \u2014 Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Charlotte, Golden State, Minnesota, New York and Detroit \u2014 having played since the second week of March. The NBA shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic on March 11, then took 22 of its 30 teams to Disney to resume the season in July."},{"id":411441,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-and-nbpa-agree-on-2020-21-season-start-and-adjustments-to-cba","date":"2020-11-10","title":"NBA, NBPA agree on 2020-21 season start and adjustments to CBA","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced today that they have reached agreement in principle on the start of the 2020-21 season, as well as adjustments to certain provisions of the current collective bargaining agreement impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

City Attorney Tearman Spencer is recommending the payment plus an admission that Brown\u2019s constitutional rights were violated during the arrest that began with a parking violation outside a Walgreen\u2019s store. Brown\u2019s attorney signed the agreement on his behalf Friday. Spencer\u2019s recommendation came in a letter he sent to Milwaukee Common Council members. The settlement is subject to approval by the city; it wasn\u2019t immediately clear when the council would take it up. The Bucks said in a statement Monday on Sterling Brown that \u201cwe are pleased that Sterling\u2019s lawsuit has been mutually resolved and that there\u2019s been an important commitment by the City of Milwaukee and its Police Department to make changes to the MPD\u2019s standard operating procedures.\u201d Brown rejected the Milwaukee City Council\u2019s original offer of $400,000 made in 2019. Brown\u2019s attorney, Mark Thomsen, said at the time that any settlement without an admission of a civil rights violation would go nowhere. Thomsen said the admission was necessary for the city to heal. Brown contends in his lawsuit that police used excessive force and targeted him because he is Black when they confronted him for parking illegally in a handicapped-accessible spot in January 2018. He was talking with officers while waiting for his citation when the situation escalated. Officers took him down and used a stun gun because he didn\u2019t immediately remove his hands from his pockets, as ordered. The latest offer also includes unspecified changes to the police department\u2019s policies, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. In a letter dated Nov. 4, Spencer recommended the new settlement proposal to the Common Council\u2019s Committee on Judiciary and Legislation \u201cbecause of the unpredictability of a trial, and the city\u2019s risk for exposure to compensatory and punitive damages, as well as additional attorney fees and costs.\u201d"},{"id":411282,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dave-joerger-sam-cassell-join-sixers-coaching-staff","date":"2020-11-09","title":"Joerger, Cassell join Sixers' coaching staff","content":"The Philadelphia 76ers announced today that Dave Joerger, Sam Cassell and Dan Burke have joined Doc Rivers\u2019 bench as assistant coaches. Popeye Jones, Eric Hughes and Brian Adams have also been named to Rivers\u2019 coaching staff, while Pete Dominguez has been added as coaching associate. Additionally, Todor Pandov has taken on the role of assistant coach\/performance director. Per team policy, terms of the deals were not disclosed. \u201cAfter taking this job, one of my top priorities was forming the best staff in the NBA,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled with the way it came together as this group boasts years of valuable NBA experience, both playing and coaching, and each member brings a championship-level mindset to the table. I\u2019m confident in my staff\u2019s ability to best support our players and look forward to getting into the lab with our team as soon as we get the green light.\u201d Joerger brings with him six seasons of experience as an NBA head coach, most recently with the Sacramento Kings from 2016-19. Prior to Sacramento, Joerger spent nine seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies, the last three as head coach. He guided Memphis to postseason berths in each of his three seasons at the helm, including an appearance in the Western Conference semifinals in his second season. Joerger is the only coach in Grizzlies franchise history to lead the team to 50-plus wins in multiple seasons, having done so in each of his first two years at the helm (2013-15). Prior to entering the NBA coaching ranks, Joerger, a Minnesota native, excelled at the minor-league level, where he won five championships across three different basketball leagues in seven seasons. Joerger coached the Dakota Wizards to the 2007 NBA Development League title, was twice named CBA Coach of the Year, and produced a head-coaching record of 232-117 (.665) in the minor leagues before joining Memphis as an assistant coach in 2007-08. Cassell most recently served as an assistant coach under Rivers with the L.A. Clippers for the past six seasons. Prior to joining the Clippers\u2019 staff, he was an assistant coach with the Washington Wizards for five seasons (2009-14). Originally from Baltimore, Cassell began coaching after a standout playing career, which spanned 15 NBA seasons and included three championships. The No. 24 overall selection in the 1993 NBA Draft by the Houston Rockets, Cassell won back-to-back titles with Houston in his first two professional seasons, and later collected his third title with the Boston Celtics in 2008, while being coached by Rivers. Cassell starred at Florida State University from 1991-93 and was inducted into the Florida State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2004. Burke has worked in the NBA for 30-plus years, having spent the last 22 with the Indiana Pacers. For his first eight seasons, Burke served as both an assistant coach and scouting director with Indiana, before transitioning full-time to the bench. Prior to joining the Pacers, Burke spent eight years with the Portland Trail Blazers as video coordinator and scout. Burke has worked for several former and current NBA head coaches, including Dallas\u2019 Rick Carlisle and the Lakers\u2019 Frank Vogel, as well as Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas. A California native, Burke graduated from Portland State with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history and social science. He and his wife Peggy have two daughters, Melissa and Lindsey. Jones joins the 76ers after spending seven seasons with the Indiana Pacers as an assistant coach. Prior to Indiana, Jones spent three years with the Brooklyn\/New Jersey Nets, starting in player development, before transitioning to an assistant coach role. He began his coaching career with the Dallas Mavericks where he worked in player development following an 11-year playing career. Jones played collegiately at Murray State, where he is fourth on the Racers\u2019 all-time scoring list. In 1992, the school retired his No. 54. A second-round pick in the 1992 NBA Draft, Jones played one season in Italy before joining the Mavericks in 1993 and ended up playing with Toronto, Boston, Denver, Washington and Golden State prior to retiring in 2004. Jones and his wife Kelsey have four sons, Justin, Seth, Caleb and Camden. Seth plays with the Columbus Blue Jackets in the National Hockey League and is a three-time All-Star. Caleb also plays professional hockey for the Edmonton Oilers. Hughes spent last season as a player development coach for the 76ers. Prior to Philadelphia, Hughes held coaching roles with Milwaukee, Brooklyn and Toronto. Before his stint with the Raptors, Hughes worked as the Director of Summer Player Development for Goodwin Sports Management in Seattle for five years (2002-07), creating workout programs and training NBA players. He also served as the head coach at Spokane Community College in Spokane, Washington, during that time. Additionally, Hughes was as an assistant at the University of Washington, as well as the University of California, Berkeley. A 1989 graduate of California State University, East Bay, Hughes went on to receive a master\u2019s degree from Illinois State in 1991. A native of Oakland, California, Hughes and his wife Kristin have two sons, Alexander James (AJ) and Ryan Christopher. Adams arrives in Philadelphia after spending the past two seasons as the head coach of the Agua Caliente Clippers of Ontario, the NBA G League affiliate of the L.A. Clippers. Under Adams\u2019 leadership, two-way contract player Johnathan Motley earned All-NBA G League honors in consecutive seasons, while Angel Delgado was named NBA G League Rookie of the Year following the 2018-19 campaign. Upon first joining the L.A. Clippers, Adams held the roles of video scouting director and head video coordinator, before advancing to coaching associate for four seasons (2014-18). Adams has also coached at the collegiate level at both Harvard and Marist. He was the Celtics\u2019 video coordinator in 2007-08 when Rivers led Boston to the NBA title. Adams is a Pine Plains, New York native and graduated from Connecticut College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology in 2006. Dominguez enters his first season with the 76ers after spending the past five years working in the video department with the L.A. Clippers. Ahead of the 2018-19 campaign, Dominguez was promoted to head video coordinator, a role he held for the past two seasons. Prior to the NBA, Dominguez served as video coordinator at UC Irvine under former NBA assistant coach Russell Turner. The La Ca\u00f1ada, California native graduated from San Francisco State University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in liberal arts, with an emphasis on international relations. Pandov first joined the 76ers in 2015 as assistant strength and conditioning coach, before transitioning to associate head strength and conditioning coach for the past two seasons. Prior to the NBA, Pandov spent several years working at the NCAA level, serving as director of performance at Tulsa, Missouri and Miami (FL) on Frank Haith\u2019s staff, and strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater, Western Kentucky. In 2005, Pandov got his start in the field as a strength and conditioning intern at the University of Texas, where he worked with several future NBA players, including LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Durant and P.J. Tucker. Originally from Bulgaria, Pandov played collegiately for the Hilltoppers from 1999-2004, while the team qualified for the NCAA Tournament three times.

No combines. No group workouts, with waves of young NBA hopefuls traveling city by city, drilling, scrimmaging and interviewing. Instead, the 2020 NBA Draft on Nov. 18 will be a virtual event, staged from ESPN\u2019s headquarters in Bristol, Conn., with limited on-site participation from select prospects and league personnel. Replicating the traditional booing of Knicks fans after the New York franchise makes its pick will be only one of many challenges. For the teams involved, the order in which players\u2019 names get called \u2014 Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman and LaMelo Ball seem likely to hear theirs earliest \u2014 will be stitched together out of thousands of hours of research, video reviews, phone work and Zoom availabilities. And include a lot fewer frequent flyer miles accumulated by the scouts and other front-office executives involved. Drafting during a pandemic might not look all that different, but how everyone got to that point \u2014 nearly five months later than usual, navigating newfound restrictions and obstacles \u2014 certainly will have been. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation of expansion and contraction,\u201d said Chris Ekstrand, longtime draft expert working again as a consultant to the NBA. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge expansion in the amount of time teams have had to prepare. The contraction would be, well, we did not have the NCAA tournament; we did not have a 5-on-5 combine. There are a lot of components of it that we haven\u2019t had. \u201cIf you\u2019re a team that has a lottery pick, you could watch every minute of every game that a guy ever has played and go through everything with a fine-toothed comb. But there has been a reduction in the events that you\u2019ve been able to see.\u201d The Nov. 18 date has been fixed for a while \u2014 well in advance of a tentative Dec. 22 opening night and Dec. 1 for the start of training camps. Yet it has been burdened with its own set of uncertainties, spread among the constituencies of players, agents and teams. Teams, of course, always prefer more info than less, with eyeballs valued more highly than video but way harder to achieve in 2020. Players have had to wait \u2014 and wait \u2014 for what essentially are their job interviews, happy hiring calls and first paychecks. Agents have had their own set of concerns, compiled in a recent survey by The Athletic as a list of unattributed but cautionary comments. Among the responses: What went from near-complete isolation did improve recently, with small contingents of team reps traveling to see players, rather than the more traditional vice versa. Golden State, which holds the No. 2 overall pick, reportedly sent a tight traveling party to Atlanta and Miami to attend workouts. However, some teams have had to yield to coronavirus shutdown travel restrictions, some have weighed their own level of risk. \u201cWhen we have a guy in our building,\u201d said Toronto\u2019s Patrick Engelbrecht, the Raptors\u2019 director of global scouting & international affairs, in a recent video conference with reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re on our turf, they put on our practice uniform, they go through our paces. Our minor-league development coaches work them out. Our head coach, our assistant coaches, they\u2019re sitting courtside. \u201cThere\u2019s a different level of, let\u2019s say, intensity in the gym when you\u2019re doing a workout in your own facility.\u201d Engelbrecht, whose team has had the added complication of the U.S.-Canada border restrictions, said it\u2019s been nice to see some prospects in person as \u201cproof of life\u201d after this long shutdown. But he added there\u2019s a different level of exposure for the player, with no peers against whom he can compete. \u201c[With] 1-on-0 workouts,\u201d Englebrecht said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have somebody to sort of pace yourself with. If you start missing a bunch of shots, you\u2019re out there all alone and you could be out there drowning.\u201d The NBA has helped to facilitate to teams needed medical info on players of interest. Agents have assisted with the Skype or other phone hook-ups in lieu of traditional interviews. Scouts who otherwise still would have been on the road last spring have been home, gathering and dissecting assessments from months or even years ago. Many teams\u2019 staffs will tell you \u2013 in sincerity or in cover-their-behinds mode \u2013 that they have been able to adapt and feel good about their evaluations. That\u2019s where the luxury of five additional months has helped. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to pick,\u201d Minnesota\u2019s vice president of basketball operations Sachin Gupta said in a media call near the end of October focused on the Timberwolves\u2019 No. 1 position. \u201cThe NBA is doing a great job trying to salvage the draft combine process and pre-draft process. We still have measurements and testing and medical flowing in \u2026 Certainly lots of different scenarios and plans that we\u2019re working through, but we feel good about our evaluations at this point.\u201d Orlando assistant GM Matt Lloyd told The Athletic their staff had draft research just about wrapped up when the college season ended abruptly, sans tournaments, in early March. \u201cWe probably would have \u2026 holed up in the conference room and watched a bunch of the first-round and second-round games together and had some discussions about players,\u201d Lloyd said, adding that any late trips would have been on a need-to-see basis. \u201cAt that point in March, the next step would have been going to Portsmouth [Invitational Tournament] and going to the McDonald\u2019s All American Game and going to the Hoop Summit [featuring college and international talent].\u201d That event, set for April 10 in Portland, also was cancelled. Staying home hasn\u2019t been all bad. While many have worked our way through Netflix lists or the home library, NBA college scouts and front-office execs have studied and re-studied game footage as if it were shot by Abe Zapruder. When they gather around their respective draft room tables in the coming days, few will have to take anyone else\u2019s word for what each player can and cannot do. \u201cEvery guy in our office has seen every guy,\u201d Engelbrecht said. \u201cMost of the guys we\u2019ve really liked, multiple people in our office have watched every single game that they played. This draft is like, what, 16 months, 17 months in?\u201d The 2019 Draft took place June 20, 2019 at Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center. One consideration, though, is the pitfall of paralysis by analysis. Too much video can exaggerate a prospect\u2019s flaws as surely as it highlights his strengths. Said Engelbrecht: \u201cYou have to be careful when you\u2019re judging young men going through a pandemic. Some may have gym access, some may not. Some may have an agent who has resources to do \u2018X, Y and Z,\u2019 some may not. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful because you don\u2019t want to be one of those \u2018study long, study wrong\u2019 [types]. Where you get so much information and it\u2019s a 17-year-old kid, and you\u2019re just putting too much into every little factoid that you can find out about a guy.\u201d Various scouts bemoaned the loss of in-gym moments out on the road, where they can glean info from casual encounters with folks in a player\u2019s inner circle. There also has been less sharing, the way colleagues and even rivals do when employed at the same task. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to get a consensus,\u201d Engelbrecht said. \u201cThere\u2019s generally a pack of people that you\u2019re constantly around. We talk about prospects \u2013 it\u2019s only natural \u2013 and you can start to get a feeling of where guys are going to go, just based on the crowd. \u201cNot having that has been different. You sort of know who the [top] 40 players are, but you have no idea what the order is.\u201d One quirk of this extended timeline affects the evaluation of overseas prospects, Engelbrecht said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a moment since I\u2019ve been working in the NBA where you\u2019re scouting for a draft and the following season already has started in different parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very strange. There are some international prospects where we\u2019re watching the beginning of their season, but yet they\u2019re in this year\u2019s draft.\u201d Even in the best of times, the Draft \u2014 heck, drafts in all sports \u2014 gets dubbed an \u201cinexact science\u201d because of the unknown variables that hover right through the night\u2019s final pick. This year, good ol\u2019 2020, it means having to cope with the more urgent inexact science of the virus before getting around to the fun one. There will be issues, too, from Nov. 19 on, when the usual timeline of summer league and other workouts and practices likely gets fast-forwarded. Instead of heading to Las Vegas two weeks after their virtual fist-bumps with NBA commissioner Adam Silver or his deputy Mark Tatum, these guys will be getting to work in their franchises\u2019 training camps. That\u2019s when the potential downside of this year\u2019s Draft prep could start to reveal itself. Maybe the Class of 2020 will develop more slowly or wind up fitting badly where they\u2019ve been picked. Then again, maybe teams will discover they\u2019ve been spending too much money, and scouts too much time in airports, when their assessments pan out about as accurately as in the past. If nothing else, the shutdown and long run-up to the Draft might offer an extra excuse to your favorite team\u2019s front office when the next can\u2019t-miss prospect in fact does. As with most of the NBA\u2019s improvisation and audible-calling to cope with the virus shutdowns, though, there appears to be consensus of safe vs. sorry. \u201cThe stuff that they\u2019ve done has been very cautious and I think smart,\u201d Engelbrecht said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to govern this many gyms, this many agencies \u2026 You\u2019re always going to have some people who push the envelope a little bit. But if you opened it up and said it was a free-for-all, that would not be a great idea.\u201d Just as with the Orlando bubble restart, things might not be ideal but at least the playing court is level. Resourcefulness isn\u2019t an underrated trait anymore for NBA teams and their staffs. Scouting departments either have lots of research on the players on the board Nov. 18, or they have plenty of it. \u201cWe have 30 games of footage of a guy. In some cases, a couple years of footage,\u201d Engelbrecht said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should overreact to not being able to go into every single gym, with every single player in the gym and everybody competing against each other in that gym.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The vote, conducted by player reps within the National Basketball Players Association, is just one part of the process. Among the primary matters to be determined: how much more escrow will be taken from players because of the shorter-than-usual season, and how the league and the players will navigate testing and other health and safety issues amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. All that has to be worked out before the plans for next season truly become official. \u201cAdditional details remain to be negotiated and the NBPA is confident that the parties will reach agreement on these remaining issues relevant to the upcoming season,\u201d the union said in a statement. Talks between the NBA and NBPA on those and other topics are continuing, though there is obvious urgency to finalize things. The NBA draft is scheduled for Nov. 18 and the plan presented to players \u2014 and now approved by NBPA team reps \u2014 calls for training camps to begin on Dec. 1. Free agency would almost certainly have to be wedged between the draft and the start of those camps, the league year would have to open, trades would have to become permissible again and some players need to be presented with deadlines by which they will have to either accept or decline options for this coming season. The NBA wanted the Dec. 22 start date over a mid-January notion for many reasons, revenue being foremost among them. A 72-game season, by league estimates, would allow for $500 million more in revenue than a season of no more than 60 games \u2014 the mid-January option \u2014 would have provided. The Dec. 22 start also means that the NBA\u2019s traditional Christmas schedule of games will be possible, something the league and its broadcast partners wanted."},{"id":408488,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-introduce-new-head-coach-silas-gm-stone","date":"2020-11-06","title":"Rockets introduce new head coach Silas, GM Stone","content":"Lofty expectations and a win-now mentality didn\u2019t leave Houston with former coach Mike D\u2019Antoni and general manager Daryl Morey. The Rockets made that clear Thursday, when formally introducing new coach Stephen Silas and GM Rafael Stone. \u201cThis is a place that I feel like we\u2019ve built something really, really special over the last 15 years,\u201d said Stone, a longtime Houston front office staffer, who was promoted as Morey\u2019s replacement. \u201cWe\u2019ve built this really, really cool thing, and I feel like, collectively, we\u2019ve really impacted the game and the way it\u2019s played. We\u2019ve been really, really aggressive as a group. We\u2019re gonna continue to be extraordinarily aggressive. Whether we get there, I don\u2019t know. But I can guarantee you, we\u2019re gonna shoot for it.\u201d Naturally, the plan to do that relies heavily on building around 2018 MVP James Harden, as well as his MVP counterpart Russell Westbrook. \u201cFor the last eight years or so, our goal has been to win a championship because we had James Harden,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got James Harden. Our goal is still to win a championship. If you\u2019ve got him, you\u2019re halfway there.\u201d Now, it\u2019s up to Silas, 47, to close the remaining distance for a Rockets team still harboring championship aspirations after finishing last season 44-28, before falling to the Los Angeles Lakers over five games in the Western Conference semifinals. The longtime NBA assistant and son of coach Paul Silas, Stephen Silas expressed confidence in his ability to lead this next iteration of the Rockets along with some help from the coaching staff the group is still building. Silas wants to add experienced coaches to the staff, and confirmed that John Lucas, who served in a player-development role under D\u2019Antoni, would remain with the Rockets after finishing as a finalist in the search for D\u2019Antoni\u2019s replacement. Lucas spent time as a head coach in San Antonio, Philadelphia and Cleveland. Silas also mentioned conversations he held during the interview process with Harden and Westbrook. \u201cI kind of gave them my vision as far as how I wanted to play, and how I wanted them to be able to use their greatness in a way that will help the team win,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThey were all about whatever\u2019s best for the team to win.\u201d Silas\u2019 vision includes what he called \u201ctweaks\u201d but not wholesale changes to the Rockets\u2019 isolation-heavy offensive system. Harden and Westbrook led the NBA last season in isolation points, possessions and frequency. As a team, the Rockets led the league in isolation. But it\u2019s not as if Silas doesn\u2019t have any experience working with players that thrive in isolation. Serving for two seasons as the offensive coordinator for the Dallas Mavericks, Silas worked extensively with Luka Doncic, who finished last season ranked among the top five in isolation scoring. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a bunch of guards. I\u2019ve worked with Luka [Doncic], Steph[en Curry], Kemba [Walker] and Baron Davis when I was younger,\u201d Silas explained. \u201cThe common thing is you have to set it up to where those guys can play to their strengths, but they can also help others play to their strengths.\u201d Silas admitted the Rockets\u2019 isolation-heavy scheme has \u201cworked, and that\u2019s been part of their greatness.\u201d But the plan is to add elements offensively that might help Harden and Westbrook exploit defenses built specifically to neutralize them. \u201cThey were sixth in offense, and for me to come in and make wholesale changes, that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Silas said. \u201cWhat I will do is try to make it a little bit easier on those guys, put in a few little actions that\u2019ll make the defense have to make decisions, and make them a little bit harder to guard; be a little bit more versatile on the offensive end, and again, let those guys play to their strengths, but make tweaks here and there so we can make that jump from being the sixth-best offensive team to first- [or] second-best offensive team. Hopefully, [we\u2019re] playing up the floor, letting those guys pass ahead and attack defenses before they\u2019re set; getting defenses on the move early in possessions and keeping them on the move, that sort of thing. Not so much kind of stand around iso-type of stuff, even though there will be that, and there will be times for that because that\u2019s what they do well. But I\u2019m not gonna take away what did well as a group. I\u2019m just gonna add to it and enhance it.\u201d Stone and Houston\u2019s front office factor heavily into that. It\u2019s well-documented how Houston committed fully last season to playing small ball, after trading away Clint Capela and a first-round pick in February to bring in Robert Covington. But Stone said he anticipates \u201cwe\u2019ll provide Stephen with a little more optionality\u201d next season to play small or with a traditional lineup. Silas and Stone spoke extensively during the interview process about Houston\u2019s need to become more multidimensional both offensively and defensively. \u201cOne of the things that Rafael and I have been talking a lot about is in today\u2019s NBA, you cannot just play one way,\u201d Silas said. \u201cYou have to have multiple ways of playing. So, small ball can be part of it. But also, possibly having a bigger guy, a traditional type of center where you can roll to the rim, or duck in or do different things to where the matchups will be a little bit better and more traditional.\u201d Over an assistant coaching career spanning more than two decades, Silas served as an assistant in Golden State for five seasons (2006-10) working under Don Nelson. In studying Houston\u2019s roster as he prepares for the upcoming season, Silas said he already sees \u201cthere were a lot of things that we did in Golden State back then that we can do with this group.\u201d Silas plans to eliminate some of the predictability we\u2019ve seen in recent years with the Rockets on offense and defense. \u201cOn the offensive end, just being a little bit less predictable I would say is what I\u2019m looking to do,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThen, on the defensive end, the same thing. Be a little bit less predictable as far as so much switching and getting into maybe playing a little bit of zone. As an offensive coordinator over the past two years, playing against teams that have different ways of defending is really tough, and it takes a lot of time to prepare for. So, I want to be that team. I want to be the team that you have to spend a day preparing to play the Houston Rockets so you make sure that you have everything covered.\u201d Stone believes he and Silas \u201chave this immensely talented roster\u201d to work with right now, but with the NBA Draft (Houston doesn\u2019t have a pick) and free agency approaching, \u201cthe goal is to bring in another guy or two who can really complement these guys.\u201d That\u2019ll prove difficult given Houston\u2019s lack of flexibility because of its high payroll. But Stone quickly pointed out that money won\u2019t be a hindrance to team owner Tilman Fertitta \u201cif spending results in winning.\u201d \u201cHe reiterated to me upon being hired that his priorities were winning first, second, and ad nauseum, and money, not so much,\u201d Stone said. \u201cSo, I do think sometimes that on the personnel side we have rules within the NBA and the salary cap, and luxury tax. If you\u2019re in them, they actually limit your flexibility. So, I think sometimes people think that you don\u2019t want to be in because of cash when oftentimes, it\u2019s because the results of being hard capped limit your flexibility at the trade deadline or something else. I know that to be a non-issue for this organization. We\u2019re extraordinarily lucky that that\u2019s a non-issue because not every organization is in that spot. But we are and we always have been.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

The man who has twice bet on himself \u2014 telling teams not to draft him in 2016 and re-signing for just two seasons in 2018 \u2014 is one of the best free agents on the market at age 26. VanVleet has seen an increased role every season he\u2019s been in the league, hit several huge shots during the Toronto Raptors\u2019 championship run in 2019, and he had very similar boxscore numbers (17.6 points, 6.6 assists and 1.9 steals per game) as Chris Paul this past season. VanVleet has championship experience, can play on or off the ball, and is able to impact play on both ends of the floor. He\u2019s not only an important piece of the Raptors\u2019 success of the last two seasons, but would represent an upgrade at point guard for a couple of teams with cap space. Given the financial uncertainty of the situation the league is in, it\u2019s not the best year to be a free agent. But VanVleet is one of the few that should have multiple suitors offering long and lucrative contracts. The 2019-20 Raptors ranked 21st in player movement, but eighth in ball movement (340 passes per 24 minutes of possession). According to Second Spectrum tracking, 61% of their jumpers, the league\u2019s highest rate, were catch-and-shoot jumpers. VanVleet\u2019s effective field goal percentage of 65.6% on catch-and-shoot jumpers was the best mark among the nine Raptors with at least 100 catch-and-shoot attempts. Almost all of his were 3-point attempts and he shot 44.0% on catch-and-shoot 3s, the seventh best mark among 81 players who attempted at least 200. The Raptors were also one of the league\u2019s best teams in transition \u2014 the percentage of their possessions that were in transition ranked first and their transition efficiency ranked third \u2014 and here\u2019s a Kyle Lowry push resulting in a catch-and-shoot 3 for VanVleet: Here\u2019s VanVleet creating the advantage and then benefiting from it himself by relocating Curry-style \u2026 A drive-and-kick possession from VanVleet is not uncommon. He led the Raptors with 14.3 drives per game and he passed on 56.7% of his drives, the third-highest rate among 118 players who averaged at least five per game. The Raptors spaced the floor as much as any team (their top nine guys were all capable 3-point shooters), and VanVleet led the team (ranking 26th in the league) with 146 assists on 3s, able to make the right read: \u2026 and also find passes others can\u2019t: While VanVleet was able to create for his teammates when he got into the paint, there\u2019s another reason why he got rid of the ball on more than half of his drives. At 6-foot-1, he\u2019s not a strong finisher at the rim. VanVleet shot 37% on drives, the second-worst mark among 70 players who attempted at least 200 shots on drives. His 51.5% shooting in the restricted area, the fourth-worst mark among 102 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. And while VanVleet was near the top of the league in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage, he shot 32.7% on pull-up 3s, a mark which ranked 40th among 64 players who attempted at least 100. The difference between his 3-point percentage on catch-and-shoot attempts (44.0%) and his 3-point percentage on pull-up attempts (32.7%) was the sixth-biggest among 52 players with at least 100 of each. In the regular season, VanVleet scored 0.84 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, a mark which ranked 41st among 49 players who averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. In the playoffs, the 0.64 points per possession VanVleet scored as a pick-and-roll ball-handler ranked last among 26 players with at least 35 total postseason ball-handler possessions. And the playoffs ended for the Raptors when the Celtics blew up a \u201chammer\u201d play and VanVleet couldn\u2019t get a good look against Grant Williams: Essentially, when it comes to VanVleet\u2019s shooting, there\u2019s his catch-and shoot 3s and there\u2019s everything else. Like their offense, the Raptors\u2019 second-ranked defense was an ensemble production. There wasn\u2019t a team more consistently on a string with its rotations. But VanVleet was Toronto\u2019s most disruptive defender. He led the league with 4.2 deflections per game and ranked fourth with 1.9 steals per game. He\u2019s relentless and handsy with his pressure, whether he\u2019s guarding the ball \u2026 \u2026 helping from off it \u2026 \u2026 or at the top of the Raptors\u2019 zone: VanVleet can help neutralize the best small guards. When the Raptors went to a box-and-1 defense in the 2019 Finals, it was VanVleet chasing Stephen Curry. And he was attached to Kemba Walker when they went back to it in the conference semis this year. But, again, at 6-foot-1, he\u2019s not somebody you can comfortably assign to the best big guards and wings. The Raptors know what they\u2019re getting should VanVleet re-sign in Toronto. While his boxscore stats have risen with increased minutes, his shooting in the paint, his pull-up numbers, and his catch-and-shoot numbers have all been very consistent over the last three seasons. Fred Vanvleet shooting, last three seasons Other teams don\u2019t necessarily know what they\u2019re getting should they extract him from the Raptors\u2019 ensemble. While he may be an upgrade at point guard in New York or Detroit and able to create for others, he\u2019s not necessarily the guy you look to for a key bucket when you need one. VanVleet\u2019s talent, experience and grit still have value in any environment. And he\u2019s likely to remain a very good player for a very long time. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The NHL is aiming at games resuming in January. Baseball\u2019s spring training may begin in February, like normal. They almost certainly won\u2019t be in bubbles if and when any or all of that happens. But many of the lessons learned from being in some form of a bubble environment \u2014 where the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball each crowned a champion after finding a way to finish their seasons in most unusual circumstances \u2014 could apply to whatever the new definition of normal is for those and other sports. A new set of rules are coming in just about every sport, almost all with enhanced health and safety in mind. If they work, games could return to arenas and stadiums with some fans in attendance sometime soon. Perhaps more importantly, they could also provide some common-sense solutions to virus issues in the real world. \u201cThe testing isn\u2019t what made it successful, the testing sort of showed that it was successful,\u201d said NBA senior vice president David Weiss, who helped oversee all the health and safety efforts at the Walt Disney World bubble in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. \u201cBut the thing that made it successful in the first place was the adherence to all those protocols that most people can follow most of the time in their lives.\u201d There was no magic bullet in the NBA or NHL bubbles: Masks were worn, hand sanitizing was stressed constantly and social distancing was required at all times. The NBA had teams in the bubble for three months, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning that title. The NHL playoff bubble lasted 65 days, from the time teams arrived in Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, until Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup. Officials from both leagues noted that mask, distancing and other protocols were still being followed strictly on the final day. \u201cIt was unique,\u201d NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said, \u201cbut hopefully a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201d So what happens now? Even as coronavirus numbers are spiking again across much of the U.S., experts don\u2019t think it\u2019s a pipe dream to have fans, even indoors, with a combination of some screening, masks, distancing and planning how they enter and exit. \u201cRapid testing would really change the number of people that you can bring in safely,\u201d said Ryan Demmer, a University of Minnesota associate professor of epidemiology and community health. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what the exact number would be. I would not feel comfortable with a full stadium. But maybe instead of 10 or 15%, you could get to 50 or 60%, which is still pretty meaningful in terms of revenues.\u201d That is a huge part of the what-happens-next equation. The NHL estimates half of its revenue comes from ticket holders. MLB says it missed revenue projections by about $3 billion. The NBA missed its financial mark by $1.5 billion. Baseball had some fans for games as the playoffs progressed. College football and the NFL play before very small crowds now in most cities, limited because of the virus. Finding ways to get more fans into games \u2014 safely \u2014 going forward is paramount. \u201cWe understand what happens with fans is going to be a product of what happens with the virus, what decisions public health authorities make in terms of mass gatherings,\u201d baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Associated Press last month. \u201cIt is a huge issue for us in terms of the economics of the game.\u201d Baseball nearly made it through its version of playoff bubbles unscathed; two innings before the World Series ended, Justin Turner of the now-champion Los Angeles Dodgers was pulled from the game after MLB was notified that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He was quarantined in a doctor\u2019s office off to the side, then later returned to the field with a mask to celebrate the Dodgers\u2019 title. He then took down his mask and posed for a team photo on the field, a violation of coronavirus protocols. The WNBA played its 2020 bubble in Bradenton, Florida. A few players had false positives, but things mostly ran smoothly \u2014 more proof that adherence to rules pays off. \u201cNo one got COVID inside our bubble,\u201d said Dan Carlin, CEO and founder of JobSiteCare, which provided the WNBA with its medical staff. \u201cPeople showed up with COVID. This was a tremendous amount of work to get these people out of circulation before they infected anyone.\u201d Border and travel restrictions affect the NHL more than any other pro league because seven of 31 teams are based in Canada, which could require some adjustments from the bubble like an all-Canadian division or potentially \u201cpods\u201d around North American hosting games, at least to start next season. Baseball\u2019s Toronto Blue Jays played their home games in Buffalo this year; cities are lining up to woo the NBA\u2019s Toronto Raptors for next season, though they remain focused on playing at home. \u201cWe\u2019re at the mercy \u2014 and we respect it \u2014 of governments: state governments, federal governments, provincial governments,\u201d NHL senior executive vice president Steve Mayer said. The NHL learned it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to physically fence in players and staff for any quarantine situations next season. The NBA doesn\u2019t want another bubble experience. That doesn\u2019t mean many of the bubble protocols and principles will be forgotten. \u201cWherever we are playing games, you\u2019re going to want to try to limit interactions with kind of our core people and kind of the outside uncontrolled people,\u201d Daly said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about, I think, minimizing risk, and so there are a lot of elements of the bubble that will translate to what\u2019s next.\u201d The one area where everyone agrees: If fans are coming back, they\u2019ll be in masks. Harvard\u2019s Dr. John Spengler, who participated in a ventilation study of ice rinks at Purdue, said there are significant carbon dioxide discharges from players and that there\u2019s no substitution for mask-wearing among those in the stands to prevent the spread of something as contagious as this coronavirus. \u201cSome of the basics that we saw around really consistent use of masks, really focusing on distance, really being careful about settings that involve eating and drinking and really rigorous and hygiene and cleaning, you saw all of that,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThat adds up to a lot of protection.\u201d Reynolds, based in Miami, covers the NBA for AP.

The vote by members of the National Basketball Players Association will show how many prefer a 72-game season that starts on Dec. 22, or a season of perhaps 58 or 60 games that would start on Martin Luther King Day on Jan. 18, said the person who spoke Tuesday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the plan has not been publicly announced. Among the issues: revenue. The NBA believes starting on Dec. 22 would allow for $500 million in additional revenue for the coming season, and the league\u2019s primary television partners also want that start date in part to allow for the traditional Christmas broadcasts. Some players, however, have said starting in December is too soon for teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat, who were in the Walt Disney World bubble until mid-October for the NBA Finals. But a January start would mean less revenue, on the heels of a season where the league missed revenue projections by $1.5 billion and 14% of the regular season wasn\u2019t played because of the pandemic \u2014 meaning players lost roughly the same percentage of their salaries. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s a level of compromise on each side,\u201d Jonathan Isaac of the Orlando Magic, that team\u2019s player rep to the NBPA, said earlier this week. \u201cYou know, this has not been easy with everything that\u2019s been thrown at the league and thrown at us just as people are trying to figure things out. So, there\u2019s a level of compromise on both sides but we\u2019re continuing to talk. \u2026 I just hope that we can get to the conclusion that works for everybody.\u201d The NBA and the NBPA agreed late last week to push back the date by which either party may opt out of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement to Friday. In the interim, the league and the NBPA have continued working on amending the current CBA to allow for next season \u2014 all necessary moves considering the existing language on many topics such as free agency, an 82-game schedule and more is outdated because of the coronavirus pandemic. Finalizing the parameters for next season quickly is a top priority for everyone. The draft is Nov. 18, free agency is expected to start shortly afterward and \u2014 if the season begins Dec. 22 \u2014 training camp would likely start around Dec. 1. There are eight teams that have not played since the league shut down for the pandemic on March 11; only 22 went to the Disney bubble for the restart in July, but of those, just four \u2014 the Lakers, Heat, Boston and Denver \u2014 were still playing as late as mid-September. Many players around the league have been working out in recent weeks, with some gathering in Miami and Southern California for informal group sessions."},{"id":407352,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/best-player-from-last-20-nba-drafts","date":"2020-11-04","title":"Best player from last 20 NBA Drafts","content":"Be it an inexact science or a parlor game, nothing requires the benefit of time like evaluating a particular Draft and grading the true winners of the NBA\u2019s biggest roll of the dice. Everyone declares the process a success on Draft night. Teams swear they bagged the player they coveted and see nothing but a bright future ahead. But we all know that\u2019s just posturing. No one knows for sure, not even when the players carry a \u201ccan\u2019t-miss\u201d label, if things will turn out as well as the projections suggest. There are simply too many variables involved to know immediately. Is that transcendent, once-in-a-generation talent the genuine item? Does said player have the work ethic and drive to push himself to become his best? Is the franchise that selects him the right fit? Can injury and off-the-court pitfalls be avoided, so the player has an opportunity to ascend to whatever his rightful place in the league\u2019s pecking order? Again, no one is sure right away. So time and distance from any given Draft, are necessary for proper evaluation. So now, with the 2020 Draft just weeks away, seems like as good a time as any to take a look back at this century\u2019s drafts and identify the greatest players in each instance: The case for Morant: A runaway Kia Rookie of the Year award winner, Morant led the Grizzlies in scoring (17.8) and assists (7.3) while playing beyond his years for a team that was far more competitive than most imagined they\u2019d be in his first year. Pelicans phenom Zion Williamson is sure to challenge Morant for this spot in the future, but it\u2019s Morant\u2019s spot right now. Other contenders: Zion Williamson (No. 1, New Orleans), Tyler Herro (No. 13, Miami), Brandon Clarke (No. 21, Memphis)  The case for Doncic: The Mavericks\u2019 wunderkind followed up a sensational Kia Rookie of the Year season with a legitimate Kia MVP-caliber effort in his second season. His size, scoring ability and walking triple-double status has elevated him to the elite level in just 139 career games (regular season and playoffs). Other contenders: Trae Young (No. 5, Atlanta), Jaren Jackson Jr. (No. 4, Memphis), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (No. 11, LA Clippers)  The case for Tatum: Danny Ainge had it right all along. Tatum was his man in a strange 2017 draft that didn\u2019t provide a consensus top pick going into the process. Tatum\u2019s an elite scorer and perimeter player whose size and versatility make him an impossible cover when he\u2019s in rhythm. He\u2019s also shown himself to be a prime-time player in the postseason, when the pressure ramps up to its highest level. Other contenders: De\u2019Aaron Fox (No. 5, Sacramento), Donovan Mitchell (No. 13, Utah), Bam Adebayo (No. 14, Miami)  The case for Simmons: For all of the bellyaching about his shooting deficiencies, Simmons remains one of the most unique physical specimens in the league. An All-NBA performer and a Kia Defensive Player of the Year candidate, Simmons has yet to unlock his scoring talents. If he can stay healthy and new Sixers coach Doc Rivers guides his game to the next level, he could be a legitimate Kia MVP candidate in the near future. Other contenders: Brandon Ingram (No. 2, LA Lakers), Jaylen Brown (No. 3, Boston) Jamal Murray (No. 7, Denver), Pascal Siakam (No. 27, Toronto)  The case for Booker: Traditionalists will argue for a different former Kentucky star (Karl-Anthony Towns) for the top spot. But it\u2019s hard to dismiss the all-around talent Booker has developed into thus far. Already an elite scorer, Booker\u2019s polished his playmaking and defense and is honing his leadership skills under the tutelage of Suns coach Monty Williams. The Suns are a rising playoff contender in the West on the strength of Booker\u2019s continued evolution as one of the best shooting guards in the league. Other contenders: Karl-Anthony Towns (No. 1, Minnesota), D\u2019Angelo Russell (No. 2, LA Lakers), Kristaps Porzingis (No. 4, New York)  The case for Jokic: The Nuggets\u2019 ability to identify and develop talent shines through in Jokic, who has transformed himself from an intriguing project into arguably the best big man in basketball. He\u2019s an impossible cover for fellow centers because his point guard skill set and deft shooting stroke from all levels. His work in the Orlando bubble showed that he\u2019s more than capable of elevating his game to that next level, as well. It\u2019s rare for any organization to find its franchise player with the 41st pick in the Draft. Other contenders: Joel Embiid (No. 3, Philadelphia), Zach LaVine (No. 13, Minnesota), Jusuf Nurkic (No. 16, Denver)  The case for Antetokounmpo: The two-time and reigning Kia MVP and Kia Defensive Player of the Year had no real competition for the top spot. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is in a category of his own among his Draft class, which includes two-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert. The scariest part for the rest of the league is rooted in what Antetokounmpo can do in the future. Other contenders: CJ McCollum (No. 10, Portland), Steven Adams (No. 12, Oklahoma City), Rudy Gobert (No. 27, Denver)  The case for Davis: He has always been the most talented player in his class. But for so long he lacked the accomplishments to go along with it. Now that he\u2019s got his first championship (aided, of course, by his partnership with James), his assault truly begins. Davis has a chance to go down as one of the greatest power forwards the game has seen. He checks all the boxes on both ends entering the prime of his career. Other contenders: Bradley Beal (No 3, Washington), Damian Lillard (No.5, Portland), Draymond Green (No. 35, Golden State)  The case for Leonard: A two-time champion and two-time Finals MVP, Leonard also owns two Kia Defensive Player of the Year trophies as well. Sure, his takeover of the league with the Clippers hit a roadblock in the Orlando bubble. But the fact is Leonard has exceeded even the loftiest of expectations anyone had for him when he began his career as a defensive stopper and role player in San Antonio alongside Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Other contenders: Kyrie Irving (No. 1, Cleveland), Klay Thompson (No. 11, Golden State), Jimmy Butler (No. 30, Chicago)  The case for George: A budding star before a catastrophic lower leg injury while playing for the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team in August of 2014, George returned even better after that injury to become one of the league\u2019s elite two-way players. A consistent All-Star, All-NBA All-Defensive team performer, George has done it with different franchises (Indiana, Oklahoma City and now, the Clippers). He\u2019s surged to the head of his class in the past four seasons. Other contenders: John Wall (No.1, Washington), DeMarcus Cousins (No. 5, Sacramento), Gordon Hayward (No. 9, Utah)  The case for Curry: The two-time Kia MVP and three-time NBA champion is already widely regarded as the best shooter the league has seen and one half of the best shooting backcourt (along with fellow \u201cSplash Brother\u201d Klay Thompson) in the history of the game. All the pundits who didn\u2019t think he could play point guard at the NBA level didn\u2019t realize that he\u2019d redefine the position and change the game with his ability to stretch the floor in ways no shooter before him could. Other contenders: Blake Griffin (No. 1, LA Clippers), James Harden, (No. 3 Oklahoma City), Jrue Holiday (No. 19, Philadelphia)  The case for Westbrook: As controversial a pick as there is on this list, it\u2019s hard to argue when you examine Westbrook\u2019s career accomplishments and impact. His trophy case is overflowing \u2014 Kia MVP in 2017, nine-time All-Star, two-time All-Star Game MVP, two-time gold medalist (2010 World Championship and 2013 Olympics) and two-time scoring champ and two-time assist leader. And don\u2019t forget about him averaging a triple-double for three straight seasons. Other contenders: Derrick Rose (No. 1 overall), Kevin Love (No. 5, Minnesota), Serge Ibaka (No. 24, Seattle)  The case for Durant: One of the greatest scorers in the history of basketball, Durant is a two-time champion and two-time Finals MVP working on leading his third team, the Brooklyn Nets, to The Finals (having already done so in Oklahoma City and Golden State). The 2014 Kia MVP owns four scoring titles, two Olympic gold medals (2012 and 2016) and a World Championship gold (2010). Durant outplayed LeBron James in The Finals in back-to-back years, solidifying his status as one of his generation\u2019s truly transcendent talents. Other contenders: Al Horford (No. 3, Atlanta), Mike Conley (No.4, Memphis), Joakim Noah (No. 9, Chicago), Marc Gasol (No. 48, LA Lakers)  The case for Lowry: Three or four years into his career, Lowry wouldn\u2019t have made this list. So give credit to the late-bloomer, if you will. It took Lowry a while to find his niche, stints in Memphis and Houston didn\u2019t yield the sort of results that would suggest he\u2019d become a franchise icon in Toronto. But Lowry\u2019s career picked up north of the border, where he\u2019s earned six All-Star bids, won a championship (2019) Olympic gold (2016) and cemented his legacy as one of the most tenacious players of his era. Other contenders: LaMarcus Aldridge (No. 2, Portland), Brandon Roy (No. 6, Portland), Rajon Rondo (No. 21)  The case for Paul: A sure-fire Hall of Famer and one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, Paul has earned every bit of his reputation as the feistiest and most competitive players of his or any generation. A 10-time All-Star and nine-time All-NBA pick, Paul has also been on the All-Defensive Team nine times. He won All-Star Game MVP honors in 2013, led the league in steals six times and in assist four times. Toss in gold medals in the Olympics in 2008 and 2012, and Paul\u2019s legacy is already secure. Other contenders: Deron Williams (No. 3, Utah), Danny Granger (No. 17, Indiana), David Lee (No. 30, New York)  The case for Howard: He spent the first half of his career battling for the title of the best big man in basketball. And if you only use his accomplishments from his rookie season through the 2013-14 season, he\u2019d still be the easy choice for the best player in his Draft class. His eight All-Star nods, eight All-NBA selections, three Kia Defensive Player of the Year awards, five All-Defensive Team selections, five rebounding titles and 2008 Olympic gold medal locked him into Hall of Fame status. The championship he won with the Lakers last month is just icing on the cake. Other contenders: Luol Deng (No. 7, Chicago), Andre Iguodala (No. 9, Philadelphia), Tony Allen (No. 25, Boston)  The case for James: A four-time champion, four-time Finals MVP and four-time Kia MVP, LeBron has always been ahead of the pack in his Draft class. In fact, he\u2019s been on chase for something much bigger throughout his 17 seasons in the league. His challenge for the greatest player of all time (yeah, it\u2019s the dreaded GOAT debate) has never been stronger than it is now, in the aftermath of his fourth title run with the Lakers. LeBron is the undisputed greatest player of the past 20 Drafts and firmly entrenched in the conversation with Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the greatest to ever do it. Other contenders: Carmelo Anthony (No. 3, Denver), Chris Bosh (No.4, Toronto), Dwyane Wade (No. 5, Miami)  The case for Yao: Yao gets the nod here in perhaps the tightest race for the top spot in any of the past 20 drafts. He was a true game-changer who expanded the league\u2019s global reach in ways that only a transcendent big man could have at that time, including posing the only true physical challenge to Shaq. Yao gets the slight edge on Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, whose ability to elevate over anyone around the rim during his healthy prime allowed him to challenge the likes of Duncan in the playoffs. Other contenders: Amar\u2019e Stoudemire (No. 9, Phoenix), Caron Butler (No. 10, Miami), Tayshaun Prince (No. 23, Detroit)  The case for Parker: Parker\u2019s Finals MVP (2007) and four championships with the Spurs make it tough to rank anyone ahead of him, even with another multiple-time champion and fellow international star like Pau Gasol in the mix. Parker was a mainstay for a Spurs dynasty and easily one of the most underrated players in the league throughout his tenure in San Antonio. A six-time All-Star and four-time All-NBA pick, Parker\u2019s No. 9 is already retired in San Antonio and his Hall of Fame credentials secured. Other contenders: Pau Gasol (No. 3, Memphis), Joe Johnson (No. 10, Boston), Zach Randolph (No. 19, Portland), Gilbert Arenas (No. 31, Golden State)  The case for Martin: Mike Miller won Rookie of the Year in 2000 and Jamal Crawford has lasted longer than anyone else in that turn of the century class, but Martin was the best all around player. A stalwart on New Jersey Nets teams that made back-to-back Finals appearances, Martin was also the defensive backbone on a Denver team that fell to the Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers in the 2009 Western Conference finals. An All-Star in 2004, Martin averaged 12.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks in his 15 NBA seasons with the Nets, Nuggets, Clippers, Knicks and Bucks. Other contenders: Jamal Crawford (No. 8, Chicago), Mike Miller (No. 5, Orlando), Hedo Turkoglu (No. 16, Sacramento) * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The doubt seems almost inconceivable given the talent possessed by the 24-year-old Simmons and 26-year-old Embiid and \u2014 certainly, at times \u2014 the pair have shown flashes of championship credentials. Yet the well ran dry in the Brett Brown era and Sam Hinkie and Bryan Colangelo failed to crack the championship code, leading to one of the biggest overhauls yet under Josh Harris and David Blitzer\u2019s ownership. On Monday, the Sixers lifted the curtain on the Daryl Morey era, the former Houston Rockets executive now tasked with running Philadelphia\u2019s basketball operations. By his side at the team complex were new coach Doc Rivers and general manager Elton Brand \u2014 an attempt at a new collaboration after Brand deemed previous combinations \u201cdidn\u2019t work.\u201d The early returns show a regime determined to gut it out with Simmons and Embiid on the roster. \u201cMy goal is to win us a championship, so whatever gets us there is what we\u2019ll do,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut, I will say, to have two star-plus players at 24 and 26 years old, that is why I couldn\u2019t get Doc Rivers to interview in Houston.\u201d Morey\u2019s unemployment after his split with Houston \u2014 he cited family reasons, but quarantine time at home will rush anyone back to work \u2014 lasted about as long as Rivers\u2019 time off after he left the Los Angeles Clippers. Pressed on Embiid and Simmons, Morey quipped he was low on the tenure board. \u201cI think they absolutely can work together,\u201d Morey said, \u201cbut Doc\u2019s been here a little longer than me. I\u2019ll turn to him. He\u2019s thought even longer on how they can work together.\u201d The job largely fell on Brand, who was thrust into the GM role two years ago with no experience in the wake of Colangelo\u2019s Twitter-scandal resignation. Brand had complained that the Sixers essentially had too many cooks in the kitchen and a shakeup was underway not long after the Sixers were swept by Boston in the first round of the playoffs. They hired former Pacers executive Peter Dinwiddie as executive vice president of basketball operations. Prosper Karangwa was hired away from Orlando and brought in as VP of player personnel. Brand, liked and respected around the league, was the public face of the franchise even if he wasn\u2019t necessarily responsible for all the transactions. He earned a multiyear contract extension Monday to stay and work under Morey. [\u201cWhatever my role needs to be, I accept that role,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow Daryl\u2019s lead. He\u2019s the president. He\u2019s going to head of basketball operations. But as general manager, I\u2019m still going to have a significant role, vision and strategy.\u201d Morey and Rivers come with sizable track records, a change in direction from an ownership group that gave Hinkie, Brown and Brand their first jobs in their prominent roles. But the days of the lose-first rebuild are long gone, though Morey comes from the same Houston branch that yielded Hinkie, and his arrival, in a way, signals the continuation of The Process the franchise waved the white flag on under pressure from the NBA. So what worked in Houston will work in Philly? Not necessarily, though it\u2019s easy to draw a correlation between the Yao Ming-Tracy McGrady era with the Rockets with what Morey has to work with in Philadelphia. The Rockets, though, made the 3-pointer king in the NBA. They averaged 45.3 3-pointers per game, tops in NBA. The Sixers were 22nd in the league with 31.6 attempts \u2014 and Simmons hit only two (2 of 24 lifetime). The triple-double threat is a liability from the perimeter, keeping small ball from working to its full potential in Philadelphia. \u201cThe goal is not to shoot 3-pointers, the goal is to win,\u201d Morey said. Who will adapt first? The franchise players who were coddled by ownership and tuned out Brown? Or Morey and Rivers, who bring decades of sustained winning to Philly and will demand players do it their way? \u201cThe best way to win in the NBA is to take your talent and figure out how to utilize them the best (way),\u201d Morey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to take your talent and hammer it into a particular system. It\u2019s to try and get the most out of what you have.\u201d The Sixers don\u2019t have much outside of Simmons and Embiid except for bad contracts and a mismatched roster. Morey was blunt when he said \u201cwe\u2019re not the favorites\u201d and knows there\u2019s a long road ahead to win the East, much less the title. They want Embiid and Simmons to come along for the ride. \u201cWe have to change the narrative,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t won yet, not that they can\u2019t win.\u201d"},{"id":406692,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-unveil-oakland-forever-city-edition-uniform","date":"2020-11-02","title":"Warriors unveil 'Oakland Forever' City Edition uniform, court","content":"The Golden State Warriors have revealed the latest new uniform for the 2020-21 NBA season .

The 18-team EuroLeague \u2014 like soccer\u2019s Champions League \u2014 is a season-long tournament between the continent\u2019s top clubs who also play domestic schedules. The league canceled its 2019-20 season in May. International tournaments could resume in March or April, Messina said, when the coronavirus might be under control \u201cor shut down.\u201d They could finish in time for Olympic preparations, he added. Adding the EuroCup, Europe\u2019s second-tier basketball competition, 15 countries are represented. That doesn\u2019t count separate FIBA competitions. The NBA is targeting a Dec. 22 start for its next season, in what would be a quick turnaround for the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat. The league finished last season in a bubble at Walt Disney World. Before the EuroLeague\u2019s season launched this month, league president Jordi Bertomeu said there was a Plan B that includes a bubble for a worst-case scenario. But on Monday, the league said it is not entertaining Messina\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe fully respect Ettore\u2019s personal opinion, however it is not being discussed at any level,\u201d the league said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cAll EuroLeague basketball and its participating clubs\u2019 efforts are focused on developing the season as approved and scheduled this past July.\u201d The league added that its health and safety protocols \u201chave been taken to avoid the activation of a B plan.\u201d The season is scheduled to end May 28-30 with the Final Four in Cologne. Through six rounds of the season, only half of the clubs have played a full schedule. Zenit St. Petersburg has played only twice after eight players and several coaches tested positive in early October. Parker\u2019s team, ASVEL Lyon, has played three games, the most recent of which included the call-up of two academy players because of a COVID-19 outbreak in the team. Parker bought a majority stake in 2014 while still playing for the Spurs. Governments across Europe are scrambling to slow a rapid rise in coronavirus infections. Germany, France, Italy, Greece and Spain \u2014 all home to EuroLeague teams \u2014 have implemented tougher restrictions. Overall, Europe has more than 250,000 confirmed virus-related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThe difficulties in traveling internationally are increasing serious health concerns for teams and referees,\u201d Messina wrote. Soon, Messina added, there will be no room for rescheduling and games will be decided by \u201cwho will be more lucky\u201d by having available players. While European soccer leagues have managed to continue mostly uninterrupted, basketball has been a grind. Milan\u2019s game last week against Alba Berlin was called off. Seven of the German team\u2019s players had tested positive in the two weeks prior. The visitors asked for a postponemen t out of fear of Italian regulations imposing a quarantine on the team. Milan, currently fourth in the standings, has played in Germany and Greece and is scheduled to play at Valencia this Friday before traveling to Russia for two games next week. The German and Spanish domestic leagues finished last season with bubble tournaments."},{"id":406493,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/76ers-name-daryl-morey-new-president-of-basketball-operations","date":"2020-11-02","title":"76ers name Daryl Morey new President of Basketball Operations","content":"PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The Philadelphia 76ers officially named Daryl Morey president of basketball operations and extended the contract of general manager Elton Brand on Monday. Morey stepped down as GM of the Houston Rockets this month after blockbuster moves that failed to lead the franchise to the NBA Finals. The Rockets made the playoffs 10 times since Morey was hired in 2007, including the last eight seasons, for the longest active streak in the NBA. \u201cTalent like Daryl rarely becomes available so we moved quickly and aggressively to bring him here,\u201d team owner Josh Harris said. \u201cHe has an extraordinary track record of success in this league as an innovator, visionary and leader, and I believe he significantly improves our chances of delivering a championship caliber team to our fans.

He helped lead the hiring process that landed coach Doc Rivers early last month. \u201cThis offseason, we made it our mission to make this organization better and stronger. By hiring a tremendous front-office leader in Daryl and championship coach in Doc, as well as extending Elton, we\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve assembled,\u201d Harris said. Houston went 640-400 under Morey and won a franchise-record 65 regular-season games in the 2017-18 season.

Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid emerged from The Process to become All-Stars and earn hefty contracts but have yet to prove they can carry the Sixers into serious championship contention. \u201cThank you to Josh Harris for the trust he has placed in me to lead the 76ers,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI am humbled by the challenge and will work tirelessly to win the hearts of Philadelphia\u2019s legendary fans.\u201d"},{"id":406113,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/point-guard-kira-lewis-jr-boasts-speed-potential","date":"2020-11-01","title":"Alabama point guard Kira Lewis Jr. boasts speed, potential","content":"In a home game against Tennessee last February, Alabama guard Kira Lewis, Jr., a couple of steps past the 3-point line, sizes up his opponent, the Vols\u2019 Jordan Bowden, a senior who was considered an above-average defender. In an instant, Lewis drives right and past Bowden, eludes an effort by Yves Pons \u2014 who would later be voted the Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Year \u2014 to poke the ball away, another attempt by Tennessee freshman Santiago Vescovi, and with the rim fast approaching, makes a split-second decision. Jordan, 6-foot-5 with a plus wingspan, is still in hot pursuit, so instead of attempting to lay the ball off the right side of the backboard, Lewis soars to the other side of the rim, switches the ball from his right hand to his left, and tosses up a high shot that spins obediently, as though by remote control, off the top of the backcourt and into the net. Lewis has an entire highlight reel of plays just as impressive as that one, one reason he was a busy man in late October, working out with the Bulls, Knicks, Magic and Pistons in advance of the better-late-than-never NBA Draft. With each workout, word of his amazing speed and ability to score at the rim \u2014 in the midrange and from 3 \u2014 spreads, which means Alabama coach Nate Oats could well become a prophet. He has been saying since the summer that Lewis \u2014 who despite having already played two college seasons is, at 19, one of the youngest players in the 2020 NBA Draft \u2014 will be a lottery pick. Lewis oozes potential. Six-foot-3 in shoes, he possesses an impressive (6-5) wingspan, and since declaring for the Draft last spring, has worked hard to add 15 pounds of muscle to what was once a scrawny, 165-pound frame. He\u2019s a scoring point guard, sure, but last season Lewis finished third in the SEC in assists (5.2) and steals (1.8). Lewis\u2019 assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5, 162 assists, 109 turnovers) seems high to some. But in fairness, he led the league in minutes played (37.6 mpg), barely coming off the floor in Oats\u2019 fast-paced system that seeks to get baskets at the rim, free throws or kick-out, wide-open 3-pointers. Playing so much in a system that grants complete freedom if a player expends maximum energy on the defensive end, Lewis was bound to get a bit loose with the ball now and again. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest Lewis can cut back on his turnovers. He puts in the time in the gym and the weight room, and he\u2019s coachable. That\u2019s why Oats says without hesitation, \u201cKira\u2019s potential is higher than any other point guard in the Draft.\u201d Oats knows that when it comes to evaluating talent, NBA executives aren\u2019t necessarily looking at the present, but the future. \u201cThey\u2019re drafting on potential all the time,\u201d Oats says. \u201cWith Kira, you\u2019ve got to compare where he\u2019s at now, with some of these other guys [point guards in the Draft]. Some of them had one more year of high school. Kira [who reclassified in the 2018-19 season and bypassed his final year of high school] had one year less.\u201d Lewis was solid as a freshman under former coach Avery Johnson, but he blew up in Oats\u2019 system, punishing a procession of teams that couldn\u2019t figure out how to deal with him. Lewis scored 37 points, to go with seven assists, in an overtime win over Georgia, 30 against Penn and Vanderbilt, 29 against Mississippi State, 27 against LSU, 26 against Kansas State \u2026 you get the idea. Lewis was a handful. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys you can\u2019t guard,\u201d Oats said. \u201cIn the NBA, you can\u2019t put your hands on the ball handler. They space the floor so well. He\u2019s going to be hard to stay in front of. His speed is the best thing he\u2019s got going for him. He\u2019s so fast with the ball. He can really turn on the jets.\u201d Oats, a former high school math teacher who loves advanced statistics, points out that in the last 28 years, only two players entering the Draft at 19 or younger \u2014 Lewis won\u2019t turn 20 until April 6, 2021 \u2014 produced similar true shooting percentage than Lewis\u2019 55.9 last season: Dennis Smith and D\u2019Angelo Russell. Lewis, as evidenced by the work he put in on his body, isn\u2019t one to rest on his laurels, which is why Oats predicts a long and prosperous NBA career. \u201cHe loves basketball,\u201d Oats says. \u201cHe\u2019s in the gym all the time. If you\u2019re going to be great and have a long career in the NBA, you\u2019ve got to love basketball.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

It\u2019s important for everybody to have that right and to have easy access.\u201d He posed for photos with fans, stood in for selfies and talked some basketball, too, of course.

He walked in an Oakland peace march this past spring. His father, Malcolm, president of the American University of Beirut, was murdered in Beirut when Kerr was 18 and a freshman at the University of Arizona.

It is the fourth extension of the opt-out deadline since the pandemic started in March. If either the NBA or the National Basketball Players Association chooses to opt out by that date, the CBA would be terminated Dec. 14, \u201cunless the parties agree otherwise,\u201d the NBA said. The NBA and NBPA need to adjust language in the CBA before a plan for next season can be finalized, simply because many rules in that document were written with a normal season \u2014 free agency in the summer, season beginning in October, fans in arenas, revenue meeting projections \u2014 in mind. The league is targeting a Dec. 22 start to next season, though for that to happen a deal would have to be struck soon. Some players have balked at the notion of starting again that quickly; it would be less than a two-month turnaround for the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat between the end of the NBA Finals and the start of their training camps. But the league believes starting around Christmas and playing a 72-game season would lead to $500 million in additional revenue compared to a later start and shorter season. Revenue is, obviously, a major priority for both sides. The Associated Press reported Oct. 23 that the NBA missed its revenue projection for the 2019-20 season by $1.5 billion largely because of the combination of a 4-1\/2 month shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, not having fans in stands for the games played inside the restart bubble at Walt Disney World, and the decision by Chinese state television to not air NBA games there for a year following a political dispute. The talks between the league and the NBPA include several urgent and unsettled topics, including determining a salary cap and luxury tax level for next season, parameters of a start date and schedule, how travel would work and how matters like coronavirus testing would be handled. This past season\u2019s salary cap was $109.14 million and tax level was $132.627 million. One possible scenario is that both numbers remain the same for this coming season, but that must be determined before free agency can begin and teams and players \u2014 including those holding options for this coming season \u2014 can start making decisions. Another goal is to get the 2021-22 season back on a typical schedule, starting in October and ending in June. How long next season goes is also a source of concern given that next summer is an Olympic summer. Olympic qualifying for 24 nations trying to secure one of the four remaining men\u2019s basketball slots for Tokyo is set to resume June 29, 2021, with the Tokyo Games opening July 23, 2021. The longer the next NBA season goes, the more difficult it would be for NBA players to commit to their national team. Meanwhile, the league sent teams a memo Friday saying players can go to their team facility \u201con a voluntary basis for in-person, group practices or workout sessions, including informal scrimmages or pick-up games.\u201d Players will be allowed to use the facility of the team that they were under contract with this past season, but those about to become free agents would be permitted there only until the new salary cap year begins. Players from other teams will not be able to use another team\u2019s facility, a departure from policy of past offseasons. Any player choosing to work out at his team\u2019s facility will have to submit to coronavirus testing and temperature checks."},{"id":404573,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-vote-across-the-country","date":"2020-10-30","title":"NBA players, coaches vote across the country","content":"Election Day is here, and NBA players and coaches are among many Americans to cast their ballot.

The team announced that D\u2019Antoni, along with former Spurs and Sixers assistant coach Ime Udoka, will be an assistant under Nash with the Nets. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was first to announce the hires. D\u2019Antoni and Udoka join Jacque Vaughn, who coached the Nets in the NBA restart, on the coaching staff. A\u2019mare Stoudemire will also serve as a player development assistant. Nash, with no previous coaching experience, was hired to lead a roster featuring Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in early September. D\u2019Antoni parted ways with the Rockets on Sept. 13, the day after they were eliminated in the conference semifinals. D\u2019Antoni has coached 13 full seasons in the NBA. And in nine of those 13 seasons (including his last four in Houston), his teams have ranked in the top six in offensive efficiency. In their four seasons in Phoenix together (2004-05 through \u201907-08), the Nash-and-D\u2019Antoni Suns ranked first, first, first and second offensively. The \u201904-05 Suns scored 8.2 more points per 100 possessions than the league average, the second best mark (trailing only Nash\u2019s \u201903-04 Mavs) in the 24 years for which we have play-by-play data. The \u201906-07 Suns hold the fourth best mark (+7.6). Those offenses were different than the iso-heavy one that D\u2019Antoni has been running in Houston for the last four seasons. In each of the last two years, the Rockets have averaged more than twice as many isolation possessions as any other team. The Nets currently have four players \u2013 Durant, Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert \u2013 who can flourish in isolation. But getting them all to work together (should they all remain on the roster) will be an interesting challenge for Nash and his staff. The Nets (under different management) have tried this before. In their second year in Brooklyn, they hired Jason Kidd just weeks after he retired as a player. His top assistant was his former coach, Lawrence Frank. But that relationship didn\u2019t last 20 games, with Frank being removed from the bench and relegated to writing \u201cdaily reports\u201d for the only Brooklyn team (the one with Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett) that has won a playoff series."},{"id":404368,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-anthony-davis-attend-draft-prospect-anthony-edwards-pro-day-workout","date":"2020-10-30","title":"LeBron, Anthony Davis attend Anthony Edwards' workout","content":"The Lakers don\u2019t have a top pick in the upcoming Draft , but their two superstars do share agents with one of this year\u2019s top talents.

In the final year of his rookie contract and set to become a restricted free agent, Ingram had a breakout season upon landing in New Orleans as part of the Anthony Davis trade. The 23 year old saw big jumps in his boxscore stats , while also seeing a jump in efficiency for a third straight season. The breakout earned Ingram his first All-Star selection, the 2019-20 Kia Most Improved Player award , and, likely, a big second contract. Zion Williamson is the centerpiece in New Orleans, but Ingram has established himself as viable primary option on offense. Ingram\u2019s improvement through his first three seasons was pretty linear, but he became a different player last season. Primarily, he became a much better shooter. After registering an effective field goal percentage of 41.9% on shots from outside the paint in his final season with the Lakers, Ingram had a mark of 52.6% in his first season with the Pelicans. Part of that was better shooting. Ingram shot much better, both from mid-range and from 3-point range. The other part was that he more than tripled his ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts. Brandon Ingram shooting from outside the paint He still ranked 14th in the league with 243 mid-range attempts, which accounted for 22% of his shots, not a big reduction from 25% the previous season. The big reduction came in the percentage of Ingram\u2019s shots that came in the paint, from 62% in 2018-19 to 43% in \u201919-20. And with that came a reduction in free throw rate, from 39.6 to 33.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field. But the 3-pointers made up for that. Ingram took 35.0% of his shots from 3-point range, up from 12.9% in 2018-19 . That was the fifth biggest jump among 218 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. His field goal percentage actually went down ( from 49.7% to 46.3% ), but his effective field goal percentage ( from 51.8% to 53.1% ) and true shooting percentage (from 55.5% to 58.7%) both went up. Despite the drop in paint shots and free throws, Ingram was still one of just nine players who averaged at least eight points in the paint, eight points on shots from outside the paint, and five points from the free throw line. Here\u2019s a look at 5 key elements to his game \u2026 The Pelicans liked to push the ball, and Ingram was their most frequent finisher on the break. He ranked 15th in the league with 4.3 transition possessions per game, according to Synergy play-type tracking. The 1.14 points per possession he scored in transition ranked 25th among 72 players who averaged at least 2.5 transition possessions per game. Transition allows Ingram to get downhill and use his length at the rim, like he did late in the second quarter in a bubble game against the Grizzlies \u2026 The Pelicans didn\u2019t just push off of missed shots and live-ball turnovers, and Ingram didn\u2019t just go to the hoop in transition. New Orleans led the league (by a wide margin) with 19.2 \u201cpass-ahead\u201d passes per game, according to Second Spectrum tracking. And 41% of Ingram\u2019s shots in the first six seconds of the shot clock came from 3-point range. He shot 33-for-75 (44.0%) on those early-clock 3-pointers, the 12th best mark among 70 players who attempted at least 50. Late in the fourth quarter of that same game against Memphis, Ingram got a quick 3 after a Grizzlies bucket via a pass ahead from Jrue Holiday \u2026 Early offense is generally good offense (league-wide effective field goal percentage is highest in the first six seconds of the clock), but not all early shots are good shots. Here\u2019s Ingram launching a step-back, 20-footer with 18 on the clock \u2026 Transition layup? Great. Open 3 off the catch? OK. Long, step-back 2 when you have plenty of time to get a better shot? Not good. There was a game in March where Williamson had barely touched the ball through the first 4 1\/2 minutes and Ingram launched a pull-up 3 in transition rather than looking to move the ball and get the rookie involved. Whether or not Ingram is back in New Orleans, it will be interesting to see how fast the Pelicans play next season. They ranked in the top 10 in pace in each of Alvin Gentry\u2019s four seasons as head coach, but new coach Stan Van Gundy has never had a team in the top 10 in pace. In fact, his last seven teams (all four in Detroit and the last three in Orlando) have ranked in the bottom 10. Ingram ranked 13th in the NBA with 3.1 isolation possessions per game. And his efficiency on those (0.96 points per possession) was better than league average (0.91), but down a bit from \u201918-19 ( 1.00 on 2.7 possessions per game ). He did see an improvement in pick-and-roll ball-handler efficiency, from 0.79 to 0.90 points per possession (a tick above the league average of 0.88). Only 68 (19%) of Ingram\u2019s 360 pull-up jumpers were 3-pointers, but that was a big jump from \u201918-19, when only five (2%) of his 245 pull-up jumpers came from beyond the arc. So he was able to occasionally make defenders pay for going under the screen \u2026 Ingram remains most comfortable in the mid-range, and he\u2019s capable of making some tough shots \u2026 He\u2019s also capable of making plays for others, though he\u2019s not the most prolific dime-dropper. Ingram recorded assists on 15.3% of his possessions, up from 13.5% in \u201918-19 , but a rate which ranked 27th among 41 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. If he stays in New Orleans, his chemistry with Williamson will be critical to the Pelicans\u2019 success. Overall, the Pelicans were a disappointment in the season restart. But they had some moments \u2026 Ingram had 23 assists to Williamson in their 408 minutes on the floor together last season. That rate of 2.0 assists per 36 minutes on the floor together was the highest Ingram had to any teammate. As a big wing, Ingram can also get into the post, draw attention, and find shooters \u2026 The biggest improvement in Ingram\u2019s play-type numbers came off the ball. According to Synergy, Ingram scored 0.88 points per possession on 2.5 \u201cspot-up\u201d possessions per game in \u201918-19. Last season, he scored 1.12 on 4.8 per game . Ingram was a beneficiary of the Pelicans\u2019 movement. According to Second Spectrum tracking, New Orleans led the league in player movement (12.2 miles per 24 minutes of possession) and ranked second in ball movement (383 passes per 24 minutes of possession). In a system like that, a player like Ingram can know that he\u2019ll get the ball back after giving it up \u2026 Ingram shot 42.0% on 300 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts last season, up from 31.5% on just 89 attempts in \u201918-19. That kind of improvement will get defenders closing out harder, which just opens up driving lanes \u2026 There are two ends of the floor, of course. The Pelicans were not a good defensive team, and Ingram was not innocent in regard to their issues on that end of the floor. An early-March game between the Pelicans (fighting for a playoff spot) and the Minnesota Timberwolves (missing their best player and out of contention) was one of the worst combined defensive performances you\u2019ll ever see. This was the first possession \u2026 The Pelicans\u2019 last chance to save their season was a bubble game against Sacramento , and they allowed 140 points on 102 defensive possessions, with Ingram getting bullied in the post by Harrison Barnes multiple times \u2026 The tools are there, though. Ingram is long, and he has solid off-ball awareness. Here he makes an off-ball \u201cscram\u201d switch onto Kristaps Porzingis, who\u2019s trying to take Lonzo Ball into the post \u2026 The Pelicans\u2019 defensive issues were mostly about a collective lack of focus, effort and cohesion. Ingram can certainly be a part of improvement in New Orleans, or a part of a solid defense anywhere else in the league. Size is key on defense, and as their roster stands, Ingram is the only size the Pelicans have on the wings. That\u2019s just one reason it seems doubtful that New Orleans will let him go in restricted free agency. He just turned 23 years old, and while it\u2019s possible that last season\u2019s 3-point shooting was a little fluky, Ingram still has room to grow. He can become a better playmaker, a better defender, and he can eliminate some of those early-clock, tunnel-vision step-backs. Though there isn\u2019t much intrigue in regard to with whom Ingram signs, it will be interesting to see what the price tag is. Two years ago, Zach LaVine (23 at the time) re-signed with the Bulls for $78 million over four years in restricted free agency. Last year, Malcolm Brogdon went to Indiana in a sign-and-trade, with a contract worth $85 million over four seasons. Neither of those guys was an All-Star. There\u2019s also the question of how well Ingram and the 20-year-old Williamson fit together long-term. There have been times when they look like a dangerous pick-and-roll combination, and there have been times when Williamson has been relegated to the role of bystander as Ingram does his own thing. There hasn\u2019t been enough of the latter to think it can\u2019t work. But, assuming the MIP returns to New Orleans, the ability of Ingram and Williamson to bring out the best in each other will be under the microscope going forward. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

The hiring of the son of former NBA player and coach Paul Silas completes a significant change in the leadership of the team with the league\u2019s longest active playoff streak after Daryl Morey decided not to return as general manager following D\u2019Antoni\u2019s departure. The new combination of coach and general manager comes after eight straight trips to the playoffs for the Rockets, all since acquiring James Harden in an offseason trade with Oklahoma City in 2012. Morey was the architect of those rosters, and D\u2019Antoni led the Rockets to a franchise-record 65 wins in 2017-18 before a Game 7 loss to Golden State in the Western Conference finals. The Warriors swept Cleveland to win the title. Houston recorded 50-win seasons in each of D\u2019Antoni\u2019s first three years and had a shot at another when the pandemic shut down the regular season last March. The Rockets beat Oklahoma City in the first round of the playoff bubble in Florida this year before losing to the champion Los Angeles Lakers in five games, the third second-round exit in D\u2019Antoni\u2019s four seasons. The former Phoenix coach decided not to return when his contract expired. The 46-year-old Silas is the first significant hire for Rafael Stone, who was promoted to GM from vice president of basketball operations when Morey stepped down. Morey is close to becoming president of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers , the AP has reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. Silas inherits a team led by a pair of former MVPs in Harden and Russell Westbrook. The longtime NBA assistant has worked worked with elite guards before, most recently in two seasons with the Mavericks and 21-year-old sensation Luka Doncic. The nine seasons as a Charlotte assistant for Silas included time with Kemba Walker, and he was with Golden State when the Warriors drafted Stephen Curry in 2009. Silas started his coaching career on his father\u2019s staff with the Charlotte Hornets in 2000.

Morey, who recently stepped down as general manager of the Houston Rockets, will be taking over the Philadelphia 76ers as their new president of basketball operations. The hire, first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and confirmed in multiple reports, brings the veteran NBA executive with an idiosyncratic, analytics-heavy style used in Houston to a Philadelphia team that seems, at the moment, a poor fit. Morey, 48, remade the Rockets into a \u201csmall ball,\u201d 3-point shooting crew in the extreme, shedding center Clint Capela in February and eschewing traditional bigs in general to fashion an attack entirely around guards James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Houston went 44-28 in 2019-20, took and made the most 3-point shots in the league, finished 25 th in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage, and lost to the Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals. Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni and the team parted ways at the end of the playoffs, and Morey announced his decision to step down two weeks ago. Morey, who had been Houston\u2019s GM since 2007, had presided over a team that posted the second-most victories since then (behind San Antonio) and reached the postseason the past eight seasons. Upon his departure, he had talked about planning to spend more time with his family. So maybe two weeks was enough during pandemic shutdowns to scratch that itch, or with everyone \u201cWFH\u201d these days, he found he could do both. Either way, the co-founder of the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics conference has plenty of work waiting for him in Philadelphia and big pieces waiting to find a fit. The Sixers finished 43-30 in the virus shutdown-disrupted regular season. They dealt with injuries, most notably to stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. After going 4-4 in the seeding games in the Orlando \u201cbubble,\u201d they landed the East\u2019s No. 6 seed. From which they promptly got swept by the Boston Celtics from the first round. Coach Brett Brown got fired after seven seasons, the first several spent nurturing along \u201cThe Process,\u201d management\u2019s strategy of earning repeated top draft picks by losing heavily. That gaming of the NBA\u2019s draft system was orchestrated by former GM Sam Hinkie \u2014 who had been Morey\u2019s \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9\u201d before moving to Philadelphia in 2013. There\u2019s some symmetry there. But Embiid has been the Sixers\u2019 tent pole player at both ends, a three-time All-Star and at 7-feet, 280 pounds, a throwback center fit for the last millennium. Simmons, meanwhile, was a third-team All-NBA selection this year despite making only two 3-pointers all year as part of his 16.4 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 8.0 apg season. In fact, the 6-foot-10 wing is a combined 2-for-24 from the arc in 7,449 minutes over his three pro seasons \u2014 the antithesis of a presumed \u201cMorey\u201d player. Overall, the Sixers ranked 22 nd in 3-point attempts (31.6) and 19 th in makes (11.6). So there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement \u2014 the Rockets averaged at least 40.3 3s in each of the past four seasons. But from the current roster, only Furkan Korkmaz (143) and Tobias Harris (131) attempted more than 300 or made more than 100. The Rockets have five who did one or both, led by Harden\u2019s 299-of-843. Keith Pompey, Sixers beat writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer , cited a league source on Twitter Wednesday afternoon when he wrote that management likes \u201cMorey\u2019s draft history and the fact that he can go get shooters.\u201d Other pieces will need to fit, too. Doc Rivers, hired to replace Brown, was described as having personnel input with the Sixers, joining current GM Elton Brand. \u201cThat\u2019s what was so exciting about this job, to have the opportunity to work with Elton,\u201d Rivers told reporters in a Zoom news conference this month. \u201cNot just on the court. I actually think it starts off the court.\u201d Per Wojnarowski\u2019s report, though, \u201cRivers and Morey have a long history and strong relationship.\u201d Rivers also has had his greatest coaching success with talented bigs, including Kevin Garnett, Kendrick Perkins, DeAndre Jordan and Montrzell Harrell. Brand might wind up staying in his current GM position but had been seeking a contract extension with presumably more, not less, empowerment than he\u2019d had the past two seasons. He is widely respected around the NBA, despite recent moves with the Sixers that did not pan out. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Morey reportedly would become the team\u2019s President of Basketball Operations with GM Elton Brand remaining in his current role. According to Wojnarowski, the deal is expected to be completed in the next few days. Morey stepped down as GM of the Rockets earlier this month after blockbuster moves that failed to lead the franchise to the NBA Finals. The Rockets made the playoffs 10 times since Morey was hired in 2007, including the last eight seasons, for the longest active streak in the NBA. He was responsible for the trade that brought James Harden to Houston from Oklahoma City. The Rockets reached the Western Conference finals twice under Morey but were unable to win their first championship since consecutive titles in 1994-95. Houston went 640-400 under Morey and won a franchise-record 65 regular-season games in the 2017-18 season. The Sixers named Doc Rivers coach this month as they chase their first NBA championship since 1983. They also brought in former Saint Joseph\u2019s star and NBA player Jameer Nelson as a scout and hired former Pacers executive Peter Dinwiddie as executive vice president of basketball operations. Prosper Karangwa was hired away from Orlando and brought in as VP of player personnel. According to Wojnarowski, Morey has a \u201cstrong relationship and history\u201d with Rivers. The two of them \u2013 along with Brand \u2013 will be tasked with retooling the roster around All-Star centerpieces Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Brand said after he fired Brown in August that he doesn\u2019t plan to trade either of his two top stars. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to trade Ben or Joel,\u201d Brand said days after the season ended. \u201cI\u2019m looking to complement them better. They are 24 and 26 years old, respectively. You try to make that fit as long as you can. They want to be here, they want to be with our organization and I see them here for a long, long time.\u201d Morey follows in the footsteps of Sam Hinkie, the former GM who designed \u201cThe Process\u201d in Philadelphia \u2014 the act of stripping the roster of talent in order to rebuild through draft picks and salary cap space to go after big stars. Hinkie worked under Morey in Houston before taking the job in Philadelphia and led the Sixers through one of the worst stretches of basketball in NBA history. The Sixers eventually gave up on Hinkie\u2019s grand design and churned through GMs and the Brett Brown coaching era with little to show for it. They went to back-to-back Eastern Conference semifinal appearances but were swept by Boston in the first round this season, which led to Brown\u2019s exit. The Sixers believed they were ready to contend for their first championship in 37 years and Brand spent $180 million to re-sign Tobias Harris and nearly $100 million to sign free agent Al Horford away from Boston. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid emerged from The Process to become All-Stars and earn hefty contracts but have yet to prove they can carry the Sixers into serious championship contention. The Sixers had only snippets of consistent success and Brown paid the price. Team owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer have been aggressive at reshaping the front office while keeping Brand aboard as the face of the organization. Hinkie started The Process and now it\u2019s up to Morey, if hired, to finally complete what his onetime underling started. He\u2019d have to get right to work. The Sixers have the No. 21 pick in the first round and four second-round selections in the Nov. 18 draft. *** Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":403372,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gail-miller-and-family-announce-agreement-to-sell-majority-interest-in-utah-jazz-to-qualtrics-founder-ryan-smith","date":"2020-10-28","title":"Miller family agrees to sell Utah Jazz to tech entrepreneur Ryan Smith","content":"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The majority interest of the Utah Jazz is being sold to technology entrepreneur Ryan Smith, a move that when formally approved by the NBA will end the Miller family\u2019s 35-year run as owners of the franchise. The Jazz said Wednesday that \u201cdefinitive agreements\u201d have been struck with Smith on the sale of the team, Vivint Arena, the team\u2019s G League affiliate and management of a Triple-A baseball club. Part of those agreements call for the team to remain in Utah. Smith is a co-founder of the Utah-based firm Qualtrics, which was sold to SAP for $8 billion in an all-cash deal finalized last year. Gail Miller, the owner and chair of the Larry H. Miller Group, said she has known Smith and his wife Ashley for some time. Smith, she said, approached the Millers to gauge their interest in a sale. The terms were not immediately disclosed, though ESPN reported the purchase price to exceed $1.6 billion.  \u201cAfter much soul searching, lengthy discussions and extensive evaluations of our long-term goals, my family and I decided this was the right time to pass our responsibility and cherished stewardship of 35 years to Ryan and Ashley, who share our values and are committed to keeping the team in Utah,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe have every confidence they will continue the work we have undertaken and move the team to the next level.\u201d The sale will have to be approved by the NBA\u2019s board of governors. When that happens, Smith will be installed as the team\u2019s governor. The Miller family will retain a stake in the franchise. \u201cThe Miller family has had an unbelievable impact on countless people through the Utah Jazz and the other organizations they run,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe all owe a great debt to the Miller family for the amazing stewardship they have had over this asset for the past 35 years.\u201d Larry and Gail Miller bought 50% of the Jazz in May 1985 for $8 million, then bought the remaining 50% the following year for $14 million. Forbes, in its annual valuation of franchises, said the Jazz were worth $1.55 billion earlier this year. The Jazz have the NBA\u2019s third-best record since the 1985-86 season, their .588 winning percentage in that span trailing only San Antonio (.633) and the Los Angeles Lakers (.596)."},{"id":402953,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/qa-hawks-cam-reddish-on-voting-at-state-farm-arena-anticipation-for-2020-21-season","date":"2020-10-28","title":"Q&A: Hawks' Cam Reddish talks voting at State Farm Arena, upcoming season","content":"Cam Reddish was playing some of his best basketball before the NBA shut down in March. He averaged 16 points with 49-40-83 shooting splits throughout his last 12 games, and to call that a vast improvement from his first dozen would be an understatement. Reddish got more comfortable as the season went on and at times exhibited his potential as a two-way star. When the Miami Heat came to town in February, it was Reddish who provided the most impactful moment of the game against the eventual Eastern Conference champions. The 10th overall pick ripped Goran Dragic on one end, then made the go-ahead score on the other with 31.4 seconds remaining. The sequence ignited Atlanta Hawks fans inside State Farm Arena, and it was the loudest the building had ever gotten following a play Reddish made, he recalled. The arena was much quieter when Reddish entered as a first-time voter for the presidential election two weeks ago. The 21-year-old casted his ballot on the same floor he made his first NBA basket. Atlanta became the first professional sports franchise to transform its primary venue into a polling precinct, opening its doors to tens of thousands registered voters while  adequately adhering to CDC-recommended social distancing guidelines. State Farm Arena is the largest-ever voting precinct in Georgia. Since it won\u2019t be open on Election Day, Reddish made sure he did early voting. He spoke to NBA.com about voting at State Farm Arena, HBCUs, the toughest player he guarded during his rookie campaign and his anticipation for the 2020-21 NBA season. (Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited). NBA.com: What was the voting process like at State Farm Arena, and how long did it take until you were done? Reddish: They made it pretty easy at State Farm Arena. I would say (it took) around 15-20 minutes. I went, met up with a couple of my teammates. They took us down, got us (set up) and then we were able to vote. We took a few pictures and got up out of there. It was pretty simple. I feel like our organization did a really good job with that, allowing people to come in and vote. It\u2019s been a success, a huge success. I think it\u2019s a good thing. How much of an impact do you think these arenas can have on fighting issues such as voter suppression? Yeah, I definitely think it\u2019ll make a huge impact because a lot of people that normally don\u2019t get the chance to vote or wouldn\u2019t even try to vote have a better opportunity since it\u2019s more convenient. Everybody has a voice and every vote matters. In what ways have coaches such as Coach K at Duke and Lloyd Pierce in Atlanta helped you grow in understanding issues outside of sports? The biggest thing they\u2019ve both helped me with is how to use my voice, whether that\u2019s on the court or off the court. Whether you\u2019re talking about \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 or yelling \u2018switch\u2019 on the court, use your voice. That\u2019s the biggest thing I got from both of them. There\u2019s been talks of possibly having more future elite college prospects go to HBCUs. You were once the top high school prospect in the nation. Have you ever thought what that would have been like? I haven\u2019t given it too much thought since the process is over for me, but I think it\u2019s a cool idea. I think athletes should take a look at it. I do kind of wonder what that would have been like, but I did enjoy my experience at Duke. Sticking with Duke, your former teammate Tre Jones is a projected first-round pick. What do you think he will bring to an NBA roster? You get pretty much everything when it comes to Tre. Obviously, everyone knows he\u2019s a lockdown defender, but I really feel like you get the ultimate competitor and a phenomenal leader. He can score the ball in many different ways so I really think whoever gets him is going to be super lucky and they\u2019ll see that quickly. I\u2019m excited for him. Last year, the rookies said you were going to have the best career. Even though it\u2019s a talented class, I imagine you still want to prove that prediction right? For sure, that\u2019s everybody\u2019s goal. It\u2019s going to be whoever puts in that work. I know with God and my abilities, that\u2019s definitely a possibility. You\u2019ve even received praise from one of the upcoming rookies in Anthony Edwards. He said you were the toughest player he ever guarded in high school. What do you make of that type of respect? That\u2019s my guy, I love his game. In high school, I was being myself and just playing my game. Who was the toughest NBA player for you to guard during your rookie season? I would probably say Harden. It was his volume. Every play he\u2019s going at you. I imagine you watched the Finals and saw Jimmy Butler wreaking havoc. He\u2019s one of the NBA\u2019s best two-way players and with that being one of your goals, is he someone you\u2019ve studied this offseason? Not in particular, I don\u2019t really think we have too many similarities when it comes to our style of play. I do respect his game. I think he had a great showing in The Finals. But I haven\u2019t studied him in particular. I might have looked at his moves and stuff like that, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m studying his entire game. Are there any players you\u2019ve studied when trying to improve your game? When I was a kid, I was a huge Kevin Durant fan. But as I got older and started becoming Cam Reddish, I liked who that is so I\u2019m cool with that. The Hawks were a better team during the second half of the season, even beating Butler and the Eastern Conference champs in February. How much can you all build on that going into next season? I definitely think we improved a lot as the season went on, and I think we\u2019re building chemistry day-by-day. Only way we can really go right now is up. Everybody is in the gym working. That gives everybody confidence. I\u2019m just staying consistent with my workouts and everything so that can translate over to the games. I\u2019ve been trying to touch up on all aspects of my game. I\u2019m looking forward to whatever is to come, whenever it comes. How anxious are you to finally get back on the court, and are there positives to being away from the game this long? I\u2019m extremely excited. I don\u2019t even know how long it\u2019s been, so I\u2019m definitely looking forward to getting back on the floor. Obviously, we\u2019ve had the ability to be with our families on a more consistent basis. That definitely means a lot to us because we\u2019re pretty much traveling during the season 24\/7. We know it won\u2019t always be like that, so we definitely appreciate it. I wouldn\u2019t say the time off is negative in any way. I think it was positive. We were able to work out individually and tighten up our games. So, I\u2019m excited. * * *  Khari Arnold is a Senior Producer at  NBA.com . You can email him here .

Announced as the new coach of the Pelicans on Oct. 21, Van Gundy combined with \u201cvery productive, high-character veterans with great experience,\u201d but also pointed out the reality that \u201cif we want to win at a high level in a very, very talented Western Conference, then we are going to have to be a very good defensive team.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to all of them, starting to meet with them in person,\u201d Van Gundy added. \u201cSpending time studying film. I can\u2019t wait to get back on the court, and to try to build a tough, disciplined team that truly won\u2019t bow down.\u201d Van Gundy replaces Alvin Gentry, who was fired in August after leading the Pelicans for the previous five seasons. The Pelicans finished the 2019-20 season with a record of 30-42, winning just two of their last eight games in the Walt Disney World bubble to miss the postseason for the second consecutive season. Struggles on defense served as one of the culprits for New Orleans\u2019 unsuccessful 2019-10 campaign. The Pelicans ranked 21 st in defensive rating (118.8) last season, 28 th in opponent points in the paint (52.2), 28 th in opponent fast-break points (15.4) and 26 th in opponent second-chance points (13.6), as they started off last season with a record of 6-22 while setting a franchise record for consecutive losses (13) with top pick Zion Williamson sidelined for the first 44 games as he recovered from knee surgery. New Orleans competed with three starters last season younger than the age of 24 in Williamson, first-time All-Star Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball, and received meaningful contributions from a pair of 2019 first-round picks in Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Van Gundy, meanwhile, joined New Orleans with a reputation for putting together stingy defenses. That, and his ability to cultivate young talent is what drew Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin to the new coach. Van Gundy\u2019s teams ranked in the top 10 in defensive rating in nine of his 12 seasons as a head coach in Miami (2003-06), Orlando (2007-12) and Detroit (2014-18). \u201cCoach Van Gundy in his 22-year coaching career, as an assistant, 12 years as a head coach, has proven he\u2019s a coach who\u2019s going to win an awful lot of regular-season games; winning almost 66% of his games in Orlando, better than 60% of his games in Miami, and for his career has a winning percentage above .500 in the playoffs, which is really, really rare,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSo, this is a proven winner, and this is a coach who can win right now. But more importantly to us, it\u2019s a coach that is a teacher, and a very sincere, authentic, human being who is going to build long-lasting relationships with our team. Because we looked at this team as just now scratching the surface of what we hope is a very long sustainable run, coach Van Gundy was obviously the selection for us because, in addition to giving us the chance to win in the short term, we feel he gives us the best chance to build a sustainable winner in the long term.\u201d Van Gundy spent the last two seasons serving as an NBA analyst for Turner Sports. During his hiatus from coaching, Van Gundy spent plenty of time studying the game, which he believes will serve him well in the new role. Van Gundy mentioned the Pelicans vacancy was the only job to pique his interest during the time away. \u201cI kept notes for 2 \u00bd years on games that I watched, on things I heard in clinics, on coaches that I talked to, and all of those things will allow me to be even better this time around,\u201d Van Gundy said. Here\u2019s a sampling from Van Gundy\u2019s introductory press conference. On what excites him about becoming head coach of the Pelicans: \u201cAs I said before, the thing that\u2019s most exciting to me is I think when Griff and [general manager] Trajan [Langdon] and their team started putting together this roster last year, there\u2019s a great mix. There\u2019s a lot of exciting, young talent with the potential to really grow into something great. But alongside of them, you\u2019ve got some very productive, high-character veterans with great experience. So that, to me, that mix is the most exciting thing. As we get more specific, I think it\u2019s a team that has proven they can play with great pace. There\u2019s incredible depth on the team. [We\u2019ve] got a lot of people that can shoot the ball. Then, you\u2019ve got two of the most unique young guys in the entire league. Brandon Ingram, who\u2019s the most improved player in the league, is one of those really tall, long guys who plays like a point guard, who can get to anywhere on the floor and score the ball. Then, I don\u2019t even know the comparison to Zion. He\u2019s unique in the way he plays. But this is a guy coming off an injury for most of the year that was able to come in and be extremely productive and efficient. There\u2019s just not people like that. So, there\u2019s just a lot to build around there.\u201d On potential changes for the upcoming season: \u201cA lot of it is where we are in the development of this team. I think it\u2019s clear just by the numbers that where this team has to get better is at the defensive end of the floor. We\u2019re gonna have to make a real commitment at that end. From a coaching staff point of view, that commitment is to do a great deal of teaching and getting down to where we really understand what we\u2019re doing on that end of the floor. From a player\u2019s point of view, the players are gonna have to make the commitment that if we want to win at a high level in a very, very talented Western Conference, then we are going to have to be a very good defensive team. They\u2019re gonna have to put in the time and effort. All of us have to make the commitment to get better at that end.\u201d On whether there\u2019s a difference in coaching a team as young as the Pelicans compared to a more veteran team: \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s all that different. I think the one thing is, and I\u2019ve already talked to our players, and I don\u2019t want them, certainly, or us to ever use that youth as an excuse. I think sometimes, you can start with, \u2018Oh, well, we were young and that\u2019s why we turned the ball over three times in the last two minutes of a tight game.\u2019 Listen, they\u2019re all great players, and they came into this league young because of their talent. It\u2019s time to play and compete. So, I don\u2019t want to use that as an excuse. But as far as the coaching, what makes it different is, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of teaching to do. And to bring these guys along, the NBA game is different than the college game in some ways. Learning all of those things, there has to be more teaching. There has to be a real emphasis placed on their development. They are far from finished products at this point in their careers, no matter how good they are. We have to keep that in mind every day.\u201d On progress in completing the coaching staff: \u201cAs far as staff, that\u2019s something that Griff and his group and the front office and I are working on together. Right now, we don\u2019t have anything that we\u2019re ready to announce. But we\u2019re moving along on that front. I think we\u2019ve got some outstanding candidates and some very good ideas, and that should come together relatively soon. The way the NBA is going, we might be starting training camp next Monday. So, we\u2019ll probably get a staff sometime over the weekend I guess.\u201d On changes he saw occur in the NBA during his coaching hiatus: \u201cThe game continues to evolve and change, but some of it starts to come back full circle. So, we continue to see the 3-point shooting rising, the number of attempts. Because of that, the amount of switching in the league defensively has gone up and changes the way you need to play offensively. I think when you see more zone defense, and that changes you offensively. Certainly, position-less basketball is becoming more and more of a reality. But a lot of people want to refer to things as small ball, and I think what we\u2019re really seeing is the value of big, skilled players. So, it\u2019s perimeter ball, not small ball. That allows you to do things at both ends of the floor. But, as the game changes, you always have to adjust as a coach. Every night you have to adjust based on who you\u2019re playing. So, it\u2019s not like the game is dramatically different than it was in 2018, the last time I was coaching, where I\u2019m coaching a whole different sport. There\u2019s just things that you\u2019ve got to do a little bit differently, and there\u2019s some different actions that people favor that you probably need to spend a little bit more time working on than you did a couple of years ago.\u201d On how he envisions Williamson\u2019s role next season: \u201c I think you have a vision for what he is, which is a multi-talented guy. He is an unbelievable playmaker for a guy of his size. He\u2019s a guy that can take the ball off the glass, lead the break, and make plays. He can make passes off of the dribble. He can finish over bigger people inside. He\u2019s a multi-talented guy. I don\u2019t look at him in any way, as far as is he a 4 or a 5? I\u2019m not sure those labels matter when it comes to him. I think as we study and try to get more definitive and talk to Zion about what he likes, I think it\u2019s more what positions we want to put him in and who\u2019s best around him, things like that. It\u2019s not limiting him to a position. I think we\u2019ll get to a starting point of that at the start of the season. My guess is as time goes on, I\u2019m gonna find out that he can do even more than I think he can do, and things will evolve from there.\u201d On interior defense: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking interior defense, people tend to focus just on the big guys themselves. I would say the first thing on interior defense is let\u2019s try to keep the ball out of the interior. If the ball is getting into the heart of the defense on a regular basis, we\u2019re gonna have problems. Our defense is gonna get broken down, and we\u2019re gonna get into foul trouble. Those poor big guys are going to constantly be in compromising situations. So, I don\u2019t think we can leave it to just those guys on the inside. But once the ball does break you down, and inevitably it will against good teams, there\u2019s a lot of ways to play interior defense. There are guys who are shot blockers like Jaxon Hayes is gonna be. There are guys who are great position defenders and really understand the principle of verticality. There are guys who are really physical. There are guys who will take charges. And we need all of that. It\u2019s not just our big guys playing interior defense. Everybody\u2019s got to be willing to put themselves between the ball and the basket, and prevent the ball getting to the rim. I think interior defense is huge, but I think sometimes we tend to place the burden on that just on a couple of guys. Like everything else with defense or offense, for that matter, it\u2019s a team thing keeping the ball away from the rim. And we\u2019re gonna have to do a lot of work in that regard.\u201d On Ball taking on more of a position-less role: \u201cMy initial thoughts on Lonzo Ball were this on the offensive end of the floor. No. 1, I don\u2019t think there is anyone better in the NBA of advancing the ball up the floor for your team quickly to allow you to go on the attack before the other team\u2019s defense is set. So many times, in watching the Pelicans both to do broadcasting and now starting to study our team, there\u2019s so many times every game where he\u2019ll catch an outlet or in-bounds pass and advance the ball up the floor on a pass without ever taking a dribble. That is very unique in the NBA, and I think really puts guys like Jrue Holiday, like J.J. Redick [in the position] for shots, like Brandon Ingram on the attack, like Zion Williamson, that puts them in positions where the defense isn\u2019t set, and it\u2019s tough to get in to help. The biggest step that Lonzo took last year is with his 3-point shooting. He improved that greatly. Not only does that help him as a player, but the space it creates on the floor for your other creators, for guys like Jrue Holiday and Brandon Ingram is really good for your basketball team. Then, the third thing I would say, and this is something I can\u2019t say that I know for sure. I\u2019m just saying this from what I\u2019m watching on film. Lonzo Ball seems like a very smart basketball player to me. And smart basketball players eventually figure it out. I went through that with J.J. Redick [in Orlando]. He came in, and it took him a little bit of time to build his career. But smart, hardworking guys figure it out as time goes on and continue to improve. So, I think as good as Lonzo is now, I think that we can expect a good arc of improvement for him over the next few years.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The resumption of the season also centered around social justice, with players, coaches, referees, teams and league officials using their collective voice and platform to effect change in local communities and the nation as a whole. The 2019-20 season concluded on Oct. 11 when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Miami Heat to win their 17th NBA championship. But after the confetti was swept away, the champagne dried and the bubble officially burst with teams, staff and media leaving the Disney World campus, the larger mission surrounding social justice did not cease. The season may be over, but the work continues. With the 2020 General Election less than two weeks away, the NBA family is committed to taking leaguewide action in support of non-partisan efforts to expand voting access and encourage civic engagement. A key component of that commitment is the NBA, WNBA and G League partnership with the Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition of more than 750 businesses focused on shifting the culture on voting and encouraging civic participation. As a collective, Civic Alliance members aim to strengthen our democracy by supporting safe, healthy and trusted elections, and by inspiring employees and customers to participate in civic life. By joining Civic Alliance, NBA, WNBA and G League employees will have access to a range of non-partisan civic engagement volunteer opportunities, voter education materials, interactive workshops, and more. And for the first time ever, the NBA has made Election Day on Nov. 3 a day of action and employee engagement, with U.S. employees able to take the day off to vote, volunteer as poll workers, and engage in other activities. In addition to helping their employees become more engaged in the democratic process, the NBA family is also using its platform and its facilities to help cities across the country vote safely and efficiently through early voting and Election Day voting in NBA, WNBA and G League arenas. As of Oct. 20, there are 22 NBA and WNBA arenas and facilities and 6 G League facilities being used to support election-related activities, including voting, poll worker trainings, registration events, ballot drop boxes and more. The G League\u2019s Greensboro Swarm \u2013 affiliate of the Charlotte Hornets \u2013 opened The Fieldhouse at The Greensboro Coliseum Complex for early voting beginning on Oct. 15 in North Carolina. In the nation\u2019s capital, Mystics guard Natasha Cloud used her voice to advocate for the Mystics\u2019 home arena \u2013 the Entertainment and Sports Complex \u2013 to be used as a voting supercenter in the District in order to combat long lines for voters during the pandemic. \u201cHow do we get #ESA to be a central location for wards 7 & 8? Voter suppression and long lines within this community could be the difference,\u201d Cloud tweeted on Sept. 23 . \u201c@TheEventsDC what\u2019s up? How can we make this happen? When we moved into SE we promised this community we would be [a part] of a solution. [Let\u2019s] not just talk about it\u2026.let\u2019s be about it,\u201d she continued . Cloud\u2019s efforts paid off as the Mystics home arena has been added to the list of NBA\/WNBA and G League venues that will make it easier and more convenient for people to vote in 2020 \u2013 and lay the groundwork for future elections. And to help ensure voters feel safe and confident while voting in person, the NBA has partnered with Clorox to provide arenas and facilities with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and guidance on usage. In addition to wearing face coverings and proper social distancing, these steps will help maintain a clean and healthy environment for all. In order for these arenas to properly function as voting supercenters, there have to be enough poll workers to keep up with the demand. The NBA, WNBA and G League has partnered with Power The Polls to help league office employees and fans connect with opportunities to work the polls in their community. Individual teams are following suit, with the Atlanta Hawks set to have over 200 employees working to support early voting at State Farm Arena. With help from More Than A Vote, the NAACP LDF and Power The Polls and in support of their \u201cWe Got Next\u201d poll worker recruitment campaign, the NBA hosted 40 first-time poll workers from More Than A Vote, President Barack Obama and 15 NBA champions in a virtual fan section during Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Following the game 10,000 new poll workers signed up, joining thousands others volunteering this election, including Magic center Mo Bamba who declared via Twitter that he will be working the polls in Orlando this year. Perhaps the most important aspect of the NBA family\u2019s efforts this election season is encouraging fans to register to vote, create a plan for voting and then executing that plan in order to have their voice heard on Election Day. In September, WNBPA President Nneka Ogwumike of the Los Angeles Sparks and Vice President Layshia Clarendon of the New York Liberty joined WNBA legend Lisa Leslie and NBA legends such as Alex English, Kenny Smith and Jalen Rose among others as ambassadors of Rock The Vote\u2019s Hoopers Vote campaign to promote voter registration and voting education. The WNBA and WNBPA also partnered with Rock The Vote on a public service announcement that ran during the NBA and WNBA Playoffs \u2013 \u201c The Voting Playbook \u201d \u2013 to give step-by-step instructions for fans to successfully register to vote, learn all voting options available, submit the ballot on or before Nov. 3. While the goal of registering voters was universal, WNBA and NBA teams still found a way to inject some competition along the way. As part of When We All Vote, nine WNBA teams competed in the Unite The Vote registration challenge to see which team could garner the most voter registrations between Aug. 18 and Sept. 18. And in a bit of WNBA Playoffs foreshadowing, the Seattle Storm topped the Las Vegas Aces to win the registration challenge and then the Storm topped the Aces in the 2020 WNBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Not to be outdone, three NBA teams also got into the competitive spirit this election season with the Atlanta Hawks, Golden State Warriors and Detroit Pistons partnering with I Am A Voter for the Voters Win registration competition, which began on Aug. 13 and runs through Election Day. The team with the most pledges at the end of each quarter will receive the John Lewis: Good Trouble Trophy , in honor of the late civil rights icon who dedicated his life to fighting for voting rights. The Hawks took the first three quarters , but the Warriors are making a strong push in the fourth. The Pistons aren\u2019t just encouraging fans to vote, they are ready to drive them to cast their ballots.

The service began on Oct. 12 and runs through Election Day on Nov. 3 with the Pistons also set to surprise riders on the bus with giveaways and entertainment on specific days. These are just a handful of countless efforts being made by members across all aspects of the NBA family to encourage fans to participate in the election process and vote for the change that they want to see in their respective communities. With less than two weeks remaining before Election Day and #VoteEarlyDay beginning this Saturday, it is clutch time for these efforts.

Hill, who lives in San Antonio, worked alongside about 50 volunteers from the Milwaukee-based organization Common Ground walking through local neighborhoods Saturday to remind people to vote. \u201cThis [state] could make or break the election,\u201d Hill said. \u201cTo spend a couple of dollars to get on a flight to come back here, to get out and knock on doors and go around this city, to show them that I care for them just as much as they care for themselves, and show them that we need them, we need them, we need their voices, we need their communities to be better and things like that, it\u2019s all worth it at the end of the day.\u201d Hill wore a shirt with the message \u201cVOTE\u201d and a Bucks logo plus a mask with the message \u201cVotes Count In the 414\u201d as he walked through several blocks in various neighborhoods with a group that included Bucks senior vice president Alex Lasry. Milwaukee\u2019s area code is 414. They occasionally would greet residents at their homes or stop people walking or driving by them. Hill would ask whether they\u2019d voted and would remind them of the importance of voting. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say vote for one side of the other,\u201d Hill sad. \u201cBut I\u2019m here to say use your voice and vote. Our ancestors, our fathers and things like that fought for this right. You should take advantage of it and get out and vote and use it.\u201d Hill made this visit nearly two months after he and his Bucks teammates opted against playing a first-round playoff game with the Orlando Magic to protest the shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, of Jacob Blake, a Black man. The Bucks\u2019 decision led to an NBA-wide postponement of playoff games. Now that the season is complete and Hill is out of the playoff bubble at Walt Disney World, he has continued doing community outreach through youth mentorship programs at his home in Texas as well as his work Saturday in Milwaukee. Earlier this month, Hill was one of five NBA players to receive the NBA Community Cares Assist Award along with Sacramento\u2019s Harrison Barnes, Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown, Oklahoma City\u2019s Chris Paul and Dallas\u2019 Dwight Powell. \u201cYou always try to figure out different ways you can strike change and be accounted for,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWhen I first got to the NBA, Coach Pop [Gregg Popovich] told me one thing that always stuck with me, is how do you put your whole fingerprints on the world and leave your mark. \u201cSometimes you have to stand up for what\u2019s right, and sometimes that may be ruffling feathers and may be frowned upon by everyone else, but at the end of the day in your heart, knowing you\u2019re on the right side of history and knowing that you did the right thing, good or bad, you have to live with that.\u201d Hill and Common Ground were walking through Milwaukee neighborhoods encouraging voting on the same day that President Donald Trump was scheduled to visit the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha, an indication of Wisconsin\u2019s importance in the upcoming election.

This offseason has him wondering if that improvement might come from within. The Heat president said Friday that the top offseason priority of the Eastern Conference champions \u201cis to take care of the players that we have\u201d such as free-agent-to-be Goran Dragic, all while maintaining salary cap flexibility to add an impact player in a 2021 offseason that could see many stars on the move. \u201cWe have a good idea of what we want to do,\u201d Riley said in his annual end-of-season media availability. No plan can be considered completely firm yet; the NBA\u2019s board of governors were meeting Friday, simultaneous to Riley speaking, to discuss ideas about when it might be feasible to start next season \u2014 with Dec. 22 as the initial target for a season of about 72 games. And the financial details for next season remain unclear as well, such as the salary cap and luxury tax numbers. All that will have an obvious impact on every team\u2019s plans, Miami\u2019s included. But Miami is already clear on some matters: The Heat has no intention on letting extension-eligible All-Star center Bam Adebayo leave (though it remains unclear when his extension will get done). Riley added that the notion of bringing back this past season\u2019s team as close to intact as possible has crossed his mind. Kelly Olynyk has a player option for about $12 million, while Meyers Leonard, Jae Crowder, Solomon Hill and Derrick Jones Jr. are among Miami\u2019s free agents. \u201cWe know what our priorities are,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt is to take care of the players that we have, that we have to make decisions on almost immediately. We know Bam has a decision to make and we do with him. We know the guys that have sacrificed for us that we really like, our free agents, especially Goran.\u201d The Heat may have ended up as the surprise of the league this season, with All-NBA player Jimmy Butler\u2019s arrival leading a turnaround that saw Miami go from missing the 2019 NBA playoffs to winding up in this season\u2019s finals as a No. 5 seed. Riley raved about what Butler has brought to the Heat, and also lauded coach Erik Spoelstra for doing what he called a masterful job this season. \u201cSpo was the coach of the year, for me,\u201d Riley said. The Heat have long been expected to be a major player in the 2021 free-agent season, when names like two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and many others could potentially choose to hit the market. What they do in this offseason will obviously affect their spending power next year. \u201cI just think we need to remain fluid,\u201d Riley said. \u201cOnce we get all the numbers and we get everything down, we get the schedule, we know when the dates are, and what the rules are in everything, once we get all of that, we\u2019re going to remain fluid.

Stoudemire and Nash were teammates on the Suns from 2004-10 as one of the league\u2019s most feared guard-big man combinations in the early 2000s. Nash was hired to coach the Nets earlier this month in what will be his first head coaching job in the NBA.

Stoudemire played 14 season in the NBA, averaging 18.9 points, 7.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.2 blocks per game. He was the 2002-03 Rookie of the Year, a six-time All-Star and made the All-NBA team five times in his career as well. His last NBA season came in 2015-16, when he appeared in 52 games with the Miami Heat. He was then signed by the New York Knicks \u2014 with whom he logged 4 1\/2 seasons in the early 2010s \u2014 in a ceremonial gesture by the team. As a member the Knicks, Stoudemire averaged 17.3 ppg and 6.7 rpg in helping New York win the 2013 Atlantic Division title.

As if Lue needed a reminder, owner Steve Ballmer proclaimed, \u201cMy personality is all about winning.\u201d It\u2019s been nearly two years since Lue worked as a head coach. He was fired in Cleveland after an 0-6 start to the 2018-19 season and used the down time to work on himself before joining Doc Rivers\u2019 staff in Los Angeles this past season. \u201cI lost 35 pounds, changed my diet. That was the main thing, focus on myself,\u201d Lue said Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cAfter Cleveland, I had the whole season to reflect on what I could have done better.\u201d Now it\u2019s Lue\u2019s turn to try to take the Clippers where the franchise has never been before \u2014 beyond the second round of the playoffs. \u201cI\u2019m big on pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have pressure that means you don\u2019t have a chance to win a championship. I want to be one of the greatest coaches.\u201d Ballmer said, \u201cTy is my kind of guy. He wants to move, move, move, learn, absorb, think new thoughts, which I think is essential to keep pushing yourself.\u201d Lue, 43, already has three NBA championships on his resume \u2014 two as a player with the rival Lakers and one as coach of Cleveland when LeBron James played for the Cavaliers. He also led the Cavs to the Finals in 2017 and \u201918, but both times they lost to Golden State. Lue went 128-83 in parts of four seasons with them. The Clippers \u2014 in the first season of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George playing together \u2014 went 49-23 this regular season, the fourth-best record in franchise history. Leonard and George can both opt out and become free agents after next season. It\u2019ll be up to Lue to balance the personalities of his two Leonard and George, who by nature are quiet and reserved. He\u2019s dealt with superstars before, having coached James and been a teammate of the late Kobe Bryant. \u201cOur two players, they lead by example. Practicing hard and working hard every day individually on their game,\u201d Lue said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have the best players be your leaders all the time. It\u2019s going to be collective.\u201d Lue believes keeping everyone healthy is the key for next season, whenever it starts. Leonard was on a load management program last season because of a left knee injury and only played in 57 games. George missed all of training camp and the first several games while recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. Lue said he wasn\u2019t sure about Leonard\u2019s load management for next season without first talking to the team\u2019s medical staff. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to adjust to my system and my program, but I\u2019m also going to have to adjust,\u201d Lue said of Leonard and George. \u201cIt starts on the defensive end with those two guys setting the tone every night.\u201d Rivers established a winning tradition, taking the Clippers to the playoffs in six of his seven seasons, by far the most successful stretch in franchise history. Playing in the NBA bubble in Florida, the Clippers wasted a 3-1 lead over Denver and lost in the Western Conference semifinals in mid-September. Two weeks later, Rivers was fired. \u201cI definitely gave it time. It\u2019s very important to me that we don\u2019t do anything in the heat of the moment,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cDoc and I needed to have some chats. After a few chats, we decided collectively that it was probably right to move in a different direction.\u201d Rivers wasn\u2019t out of a job for long, getting hired the same week to coach the Philadelphia 76ers. Ballmer was quick to address Rivers\u2019 departure, bringing it up even before mentioning Lue. \u201cI really want to thank Doc Rivers. Doc was obviously a fantastic championship coach,\u201d Ballmer said, apparently referring to the 2008 NBA title Rivers won as coach of the Boston Celtics. \u201cHe\u2019s been a mentor since I first purchased the Clippers six years ago. I\u2019m so grateful to Doc. Doc is a very special human being. He\u2019s been a great ambassador and a great person. I wish him well in Philadelphia, except for the two days a year when we play him.\u201d Lue experienced a loss when Rivers was sent packing. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough,\u201d he said. \u201cDoc has been my mentor since I\u2019ve been in the league. Without Doc, I wouldn\u2019t be in this position today.\u201d Lue was a candidate for other head coaching jobs this offseason. Ballmer cited Lue\u2019s accountability and his ability to connect with the players as factors that make \u201cthe best of the best is Ty Lue.\u201d \u201cThey chose me,\u201d Lue said. \u201cIt feels good to be wanted.\u201d"},{"id":398074,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/celtics-daniel-theis-medical-update-official-release","date":"2020-10-22","title":"Daniel Theis medical update","content":"BOSTON \u2014 Celtics center Daniel Theis yesterday underwent a successful arthroscopic procedure on his left knee, including removal of a loose body.

Van Gundy had been serving as an NBA analyst for Turner Sports before agreeing to this deal. Prior to that, Van Gundy spent 12 seasons as an NBA coach from 2003-18, serving in that role with the Miami Heat (2003-06), Orlando Magic (2007-12) and Detroit Pistons (2014-18). The Pelicans fired coach Alvin Gentry in early August after he served as New Orleans\u2019 coach for the previous five seasons. New Orleans went 30-42 last season, finishing with just two victories in its final eight games despite the presence of top overall draft choice Zion Williamson and first-time All-Star Brandon Ingram in the lineup until the club was eliminated from playoff contention with two games to play. New Orleans started 2019-20 at 6-22 and labored through a franchise record 13-game losing streak as Williamson missed the first 44 games of the season while recovering from knee surgery. The Pelicans rallied back into contention for a playoff berth and were virtually at full health when the season resumed in central Florida in July after a hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Pelicans had three starters this season \u2014 Williamson, Ingram and Lonzo Ball \u2014 who were younger than 24 and had no playoff experience. Two other regulars \u2014 Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander Walker \u2014 were also 2019 first-round Draft picks. And the Pelicans have a slew of Draft picks still to come from last year\u2019s trade of Anthony Davis to the Lakers. Per multiple reports, what separated Van Gundy from the pack of other potential names for New Orleans\u2019 vacancy was his ability to craft young talent as well as his history of building top defensive teams in the NBA. In Miami, Van Gundy\u2019s teams never ranked lower than 10th in Defensive Rating ( 103.4 in 2005-06 ), his Orlando team ranked in the top 5 in Defensive Rating for three straight seasons ( 2008-11 ) and the Pistons improved from 25th in Defensive Rating before his arrival (2013-14) to a top-10 defensive team in his last two seasons .  Van Gundy has coached 907 games in his career, amassing a 523-384 record and led the Magic to The Finals in 2009. His offensive game plan around center Dwight Howard was instrumental in Orlando reaching The Finals. Howard became a Kia MVP candidate under Van Gundy\u2019s tutelage and won his three consecutive Kia Defensive Player of the Year awards (2008-11) while playing for Van Gundy. Additionally, Jameer Nelson and Rashard Lewis enjoyed their lone All-Star seasons under Van Gundy (2008-09) while reserve Ryan Anderson was named Kia Most Improved Player as a player under Van Gundy (2011-12). As coach of the Heat, Van Gundy went 112-73 as Miami transitioned into a new era with young phenom Dwyane Wade. Before the 2004-05 season, the Heat traded for former Kia MVP winner Shaquille O\u2019Neal in a blockbuster swap with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Heat reached the Eastern Conference finals where they lost to the Pistons and, after an 11-10 start in 2005-06, Van Gundy was fired and his boss, current Heat president Pat Riley, replaced him as coach. In Detroit, Van Gundy went 152-176 over four years as Detroit\u2019s head coach and president of basketball operations with only one playoff appearance \u2014 a 4-0 first-round loss to Cleveland in 2016 \u2014 to show for it. He engineered the trade in 2017-18 with the LA Clippers for former All-Star forward Blake Griffin. Although Detroit got off to a hot start with Griffin, the Pistons stumbled down the stretch and missed the playoffs for the second straight season and third time in four seasons.

Less than 24 hours after accepting the job, the 45-year-old former Toronto Raptors assistant started explaining his plan . He expects the Pacers to move the ball and take more 3-pointers. He wants the defense to be more disruptive. He promises not to get locked into rotations and will be willing to take risks. Perhaps most important, he believes there needs to be more communication between coaches and players. Those are exactly the traits president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard hoped to find when he embarked on a coaching search two months ago and Bjorkgren became the perfect fit. \u201cThere are people in this world who bring energy and you like being around them,\u201d Pritchard said after introducing Bjorkgren on a Zoom call. \u201cI think the litmus test is when those guys call you, you can\u2019t wait to pick up the phone. Nate has those characteristics, and when he went through his presentation he created a vision that I could physically see in my mind how he was going to coach. We knew he was the right guy.\u201d The proof will come in time. But the 45-year-old, first-time NBA head coach certainly presented a different kind of vision, one Pacers fans may embrace after watching years of stodgy, half-court basketball. Bjorkgren wants to shatter those norms. He prefers an evolving style that conforms only to circumstances. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a fun team to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of movement on both sides of the ball, different guys handling the ball, pushing it up the floor. We want to utilize the 3-point line. My approach to defense is you change and change quite frequently, between quarters, after timeouts, during an 8-0 run, I think that\u2019s the disruptive part.\u201d Bjorkgren developed his coaching style working largely with Raptors coach Nick Nurse. Nurse first hired Bjorkgren as an assistant in 2007 with the Iowa Energy. Following their first season together, Bjorkgren described how he and Nurse held daily whiteboard sessions to discuss strategy. It was there, in the G-League over the next seven seasons \u2014 three as Nurse\u2019s assistant, four as a head coach \u2014 where Bjorkgren learned the value of flexibility. With small coaching staffs and ever-changing rosters, Bjorkgren managed to go 126-74 with the Dakota Wizards, Santa Cruz Warriors, Energy and Bakersfield Jam before joining the Phoenix Suns in 2015. \u201cYou have to adapt very early and quite often,\u201d Bjorkgren said. \u201cYou could be at a shootaround and two guys get called up and another is going overseas so you have to coach on the fly. You have to know the next guy will be there and that\u2019s the part of the coaching, keeping everybody ready at all times.\u201d He put those lessons to work when he was reunited with Nurse in Toronto two years ago. In Bjorkgren\u2019s first season with the Raptors, Kawhi Leonard led the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 2 seed to its first NBA championship. Leonard\u2019s departure in free agency last summer didn\u2019t change much in terms of philosophy or success. The Raptors still went 53-19, still earned the second seed in the East and still reached the conference semifinals before losing to Boston in seven games. So when Pritchard saw Toronto\u2019s 23-12 postseason record over the past two seasons and compared it to the Pacers playoff mark of 3-16 over the last four seasons, he was sold. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to take risks in the NBA today,\u201d Pritchard said. \u201cWe think that helps you down the line. Maybe not early, but down the line in the playoffs and that\u2019s where we want to get better.\u201d The biggest offseason question for Pritchard is the future of two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo, who has been cleared to do his full complement of workouts. Oladipo can become a free agent after next season. \u201cHe feels good about the team. He\u2019s talked to me about how he thinks this tam can be very good,\u201d Pritchard said. \u201cWe hear a lot of things, but until it comes to me, I don\u2019t really worry about that.\u201d And perhaps Bjorkgren can help help convince Oladipo to stay with his new approach, too. \u201cI wanted this job so bad because of the talent on this team,\u201d Bjorkgren said. \u201cAs you know they\u2019re great basketball players, and they\u2019re even better people. Just getting to know them more in the last 24 hours is really special to me, and I look forward to getting to know them more as we move forward.\u201d"},{"id":397077,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-name-tyronn-lue-head-coach","date":"2020-10-21","title":"Clippers name Tyronn Lue head coach","content":"The L.A.

He was 100. Hartman, whose first newspaper column was published in 1945, died surrounded by his family, Star Tribune sports editor Chris Carr said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day,\u201d Carr told The Associated Press. \u201cHe is the Star Tribune in many ways, at least in the sports department. It speaks to his amazing life that even at 100 and a half years old, he passes away and we still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d He kept up his age-defying pace even after his 100th birthday party on March 15 was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hartman continued to write three columns per week for the Star Tribune as a centenarian, four during football season, and served as co-host of a Sunday morning radio show on WCCO-AM in Minneapolis. \u201cI have followed the advice that if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,\u201d Hartman wrote in his column published on his 100th birthday . \u201cEven at 100, I can say I still love what I do.\u201d Hartman grew up poor on Minneapolis\u2019 tough north side, the son of a Russian immigrant father and Latvian mother who at age 9 began selling newspapers on downtown street corners. He dropped out of high school in the 10th grade for a news run, picking up papers and leaving them in drop boxes. In 1944, the circulation manager recommended Hartman for an internship on the sports desk at the old Minneapolis Times. A year later, he was in print with a roundup of news and notes, a style he continued throughout his career. Hartman always called himself a reporter, not a writer. After the Times folded in 1948, Hartman went to work at the Minneapolis Tribune covering his beloved University of Minnesota. Former Minnesota Vikings coach Bud Grant recalled attending the university after World War II and running into Hartman on Hartman\u2019s first day as a beat writer. Grant and his wife became friends with Hartman, and when Grant announced his first retirement as Vikings coach in 1984, he shared the scoop only with Hartman. \u201cThey\u2019d say \u2018off-the-record,\u2019 and to Sid that was off-the-record. He never broke a confidence, with anybody I ever knew,\u201d Grant once said. Hartman was an unapologetic throwback to the days when the wall between sportswriters and the teams and players they covered was not as defined. Colleagues referred to \u201cSid\u2019s Rules,\u201d which applied to Hartman and no one else. \u201cIt was kind of the Wild West, and Sid was the top gunfighter,\u201d said Dave Mona, Hartman\u2019s \u201cSports Huddle\u201d co-host since the WCCO-AM radio program debuted in 1981. Often because of the favorable coverage he gave to local sports teams, Hartman was granted unparalleled behind-the-scenes access to players, coaches and executives. He was given free rein to roam where he wanted, when he wanted. Hartman was instrumental in helping lure pro teams to Minnesota. In his autobiography \u201cSid!\u201d (co-written with fellow Star Tribune sports columnist Patrick Reusse), Hartman wrote that in 1947 he offered $15,000 to the owner of the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League for the franchise, then went to Detroit to deliver the check. The team became the Minneapolis Lakers, and Hartman was the de facto general manager. Led by big man George Mikan, the Lakers won the NBL championship in their first season and five NBA championships. Hartman left the Lakers operation in 1957, and the team moved to Los Angeles in 1960. He did all that while continuing his newspaper work, a blatant conflict-of-interest by today\u2019s standards but an accepted practice in those days. Yet he always tried to outwork other reporters for scoops. He was a familiar sight at most games and news conferences, lugging a large, clunky, outdated tape recorder and a thick, black book stuffed with pages of phone numbers. From George Steinbrenner to Bob Knight to Pete Carroll, Hartman\u2019s rolodex has long been a who\u2019s-who of the sports world. Hartman\u2019s distinctive gruff, slurred speech and malaprops made him a favorite of listeners, media colleagues and the players and coaches he covered to imitate. On the radio, Hartman would sometime hang up on or chastise callers \u2014 \u201cgeniuses,\u201d as Hartman called them \u2014 who voiced opinions he disagreed with. Despite his reputation as a curmudgeon, Hartman was routinely approached by fans for autographs and always obliged them. In 2010, to mark his 90th birthday, a statute showing Hartman holding a radio microphone, carrying an oversized tape recorder and with a Star Tribune tucked under his arm was unveiled on a corner outside Target Center, the home of the NBA\u2019s Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cPart of my job was to bring him into the \u201980s. Sometimes he came fairly easily and sometimes he didn\u2019t,\u201d said former Star Tribune editor Tim McGuire. \u201cHe always was too much of a booster, and he loved his Gophers. But he was always a newsman.\u201d Hartman also was a frequent critic of women\u2019s athletics, which he thought cut into expenditures for men\u2019s sports at University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s archaic,\u201d former Star Tribune sports editor Glen Crevier said of Hartman\u2019s attitude in 2009, \u201cbut at least he doesn\u2019t write negatively about them anymore. He just avoids them.\u201d Hartman\u2019s son, Chad, followed his father into sports reporting, as play-by-play announcer for the Timberwolves and a local talk show host. When his 100th birthday column was published, the Star Tribune put his career byline count at 21,149."},{"id":356060,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-mourns-loss-longtime-scout-bj-johnson","date":"2020-10-16","title":"NBA mourns loss of longtime Rockets scout Brent 'BJ' Johnson","content":"Longtime Houston Rockets personnel scout Brent \u201cBJ\u201d Johnson tragically died in a bicycle accident Thursday.

Morey said he made the decision to pend more time with his two college-aged children, who are taking a year off from school during the pandemic, and to \u201csee what other potential challenges could be out there.\u201d The Rockets announced the move Thursday night. Morey said he\u2019s leaving the team Nov. 1. Tilman Fertitta, who has owned the Rockets since 2017, said Morey told him of his decision the day the team got back to Houston from the NBA bubble about a month ago. \u201cDaryl is one of the premier GM\u2019s in the league and I\u2019m disappointed \u2026 [but] Daryl made it real clear he wasn\u2019t staying here forever,\u201d Fertitta said in an interview with The Associated Press . \u201cWhen I bought the team, he told me that. And he decided this is the time that he wants to change his life.\u201d Fertitta added that Morey is helping him through the transition and they\u2019ll promote vice president of basketball operations Rafael Stone to general manager. Morey caused an international uproar last year when he tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Morey tweeted an image that said: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d His tweet was in reference to pro-democracy demonstrations in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory that had been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement. The tweet caused businesses in China to cut ties with the Rockets and broadcasters there refused to air the team\u2019s games this season. NBA telecasts in China, however, resumed during the recent NBA Finals . Morey said Fertitta\u2019s support for him never wavered, even in the wake of the tweet. \u201cFrom Day 1 Tilman has been behind me \u2026 and I will always appreciate that,\u201d Morey said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s never been a factor in anything here.\u201d Fertitta scoffed when asked if he thinks he can repair some of the business relationships the team lost in China now that Morey is leaving. \u201cIt isn\u2019t even anything that\u2019s popped in my head or considered,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about the two tied together.\u201d The Rockets have made the playoffs 10 times since Morey was hired in 2007, including the last eight seasons for the longest active streak in the NBA. Morey was responsible for the blockbuster trade that brought James Harden to Houston from Oklahoma City. The Rockets reached the Western Conference finals twice under Morey but were unable to win their first championship since consecutive titles in 1994-95. Fertitta is grateful for Morey\u2019s contributions in his time with the team and said he\u2019ll always consider him a part of it, even though he is stepping down. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great run and I appreciate everything Daryl\u2019s done,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have any questions or need his support, he\u2019s there for me and this organization \u2026 he will be a Rocket forever. And that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d The move comes after coach Mike D\u2019Antoni told the team he would not return after the Rockets lost to the Lakers in the conference semifinals. Houston went 640-400 with Morey as the general manager and won a franchise-record 65 regular-season games in the 2017-18 season. That was the second time they lost in the conference finals under Morey, falling to the Warriors in seven games after also losing to them in the conference finals in 2015. As Morey prepares for his next chapter, he said his proudest accomplishment was that 65-win season. \u201cI think that was the best team in the league that year,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut to be fair to Golden State, who is maybe the best team all-time, they were a little better than us.\u201d It was difficult for Morey to decide to leave the team without having helped the Rockets to another title. \u201cYeah, very, but unfortunately in our business unless you\u2019re Golden State or have a certain player, there haven\u2019t been a lot of titles to go around,\u201d he said referring to LeBron James. \u201cBut I wish we had snuck in there and won one.\u201d Morey is an MIT graduate who became one of the early proponents of the use of analytics in the NBA. He was always making a trade or deal of some kind and was also responsible for the signing of Dwight Howard in 2013 and for trading multiple players to the Clippers in 2017 for Chris Paul. He then dealt Paul to the Thunder before this season for Russell Westbrook. In perhaps his most unconventional move, he got rid of center Clint Capela in a three-team trade in February and the Rockets played \u201csmall ball\u201d the rest of the season without a true center. Morey worked as Houston\u2019s assistant general manager for one season under Carroll Dawson before he retired after the 2007 season and Morey was promoted to his job. Though he\u2019s taking a break for now, Morey hasn\u2019t ruled out a return to sports or maybe even the NBA. \u201cI\u2019m sort of open on what\u2019s next,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do love sports. I do love the NBA. And I do think a big part of of doing this is to see \u2014 I haven\u2019t had a chance for many years to just see what new challenges might be out there.\u201d * * *"},{"id":261861,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-unveil-new-uniforms-2020-21-season","date":"2020-10-15","title":"Raptors unveil 3 new uniforms for 2020-21 season","content":"The Toronto Raptors are looking to their past a bit as they prepare their uniform looks for the 2020-21 season.

He averaged 17.6 points and 6.6 assists per game , while leading the league in deflections (4.2 per game) for the No. 2-ranked defense. There are teams \u2014 Detroit and New York, in particular \u2014 with cap space and a need at point guard. So the Raptors will likely need to cut significantly into their 2021 cap space to keep VanVleet in Toronto. And the 26-year-old is just one of three unrestricted free agents in the Raptors\u2019 core seven. Number to know: VanVleet passed on 56.7% of his drives, the highest rate among 113 players who averaged at least five drives in 30 games or more. Related free agents:  Marc Gasol (TOR) and Serge Ibaka (TOR) \u2014 The Raptors have two reliable centers, but they\u2019re 35 and 30 years old, respectively, and they\u2019re both unrestricted free agents. There have already been more than whispers about Gasol taking his talents back to Spain. More related free agents:  Kris Dunn (CHI) and De\u2019Anthony Melton (MEM) \u2014 Dunn (26) and Melton (22), though they\u2019re both restricted free agents, will come a lot cheaper than VanVleet, but they\u2019re both solid back-up point guards who can get at it defensively. In fact, they ranked first and third in deflections per 36 minutes among 300 players who played at least 750 total minutes last season. Offense, alas, is another story. There are far fewer questions about Ingram now than there were a year ago. With a move to New Orleans and a much-improved jumper, he won the Kia Most Improved Player award . And with Ingram having just turned 23 years old, it\u2019s seems like a no-brainer that the Pelicans will bring him back, especially because they can match any offer he might get elsewhere. But it will be interesting to see what the final price tag is. And it\u2019s fair to wonder how well he fits alongside Zion Williamson long-term, in that Ingram will relegate Williamson to the role of bystander on a certain number of possessions when they\u2019re on the floor together. It\u2019s on the Pelicans\u2019 next coach to make it work on both ends of the floor (there were no innocent parties when it came to how poorly New Orleans defended in key games down the stretch this season). Number to know: Ingram took 35% of his shots from 3-point range, up from 12.9% in 2018-19 . That was the fifth-biggest jump among 218 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. His 3-point percentage jumped from 33.0% to 39.1% and the 150 3-pointers he made were more than he made in his first three seasons combined. Related free agent:  Derrick Favors (NOP) \u2014 Twenty-year-old Jaxson Hayes is seemingly the Pelicans\u2019 five of the future, but Favors (still just 28) was a solid center, especially defensively, in his first year in New Orleans. Williamson will likely be a part-time center himself going forward, but the Pelicans outscored their opponents by 12.1 points per 100 possessions (allowing just 100.4) in 368 total minutes with Williamson and Favors on the floor together. The departure of coach Billy Donovan was an indication that the Thunder are going to take a step backward this offseason. Trading Chris Paul (who has two years and $86 million left on his deal) would obviously be the bigger step, but letting Gallinari walk will be the simpler one. Maximizing your offensive potential means having a four who can shoot, and Gallinari is that guy. He\u2019s 32, but he\u2019s one of four players (Joe Harris and Davis Bertans are two of the other three) who have shot 40% or better on at least 300 3-point attempts in each of the last two seasons. Number to know: In the regular season, the Thunder scored 16.6 more points per 100 possessions with Gallinari on the floor (116.9) than they did with him off the floor (100.3). That was the biggest on-off OffRtg differential among 236 players who played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team. Related free agent:  Gordon Hayward (BOS) \u2014 With greater uncertainty and far fewer teams with cap space, it seems doubtful that Hayward would pull the same move as Al Horford did last year, opting out of the final year of his deal ($34.2 million) and landing somewhere other than Boston.  If the Clippers had reached The Finals with Harrell playing like a Sixth Man of the Year, this would seemingly be academic. But the Clippers blew a 3-1 lead in the conference semifinals and Harrell had a rough postseason. Over their 13 playoff games the team was 27.2 points per 100 possessions better with Harrell off the floor (+15.6) than it was with him on the floor (-11.6). While Harrell took a step backward, starting center Ivica Zubac (three years younger) improved, and the Clippers also used JaMychal Green (who has a player option on the final year of his deal) as a back-up center. There are other teams out there \u2014 Toronto is one \u2014 that have bigger questions regarding their frontline than the Clippers do. Given the circumstances (playing in a bubble after a month-long bereavement absence), one could certainly dismiss Harrell\u2019s postseason performance and focus on a pre-hiatus season in which he was an impact player on both ends of the floor. He ranked third in roll-man efficiency, while also grading out as one of the league\u2019s best rim protectors . Number to know: Harrell ranked second with 393 total baskets in the restricted area in the regular season. Related free agents:  JaMychal Green (LAC), Marcus Morris (LAC) \u2014 Along with Zubac, this group of three gave the Clippers a lot of versatility up front. Another related free agent:  Jakob Poeltl (SAS) \u2014 If the Spurs are turning things over to the youth, they\u2019d best keep the 25-year-old Poeltl (a restricted free agent) in house. He ranks as one of the league\u2019s best rim protectors and the Spurs were also much better offensively with his prolific screen setting on the floor last season. After playing just 36 games in 2018-19, Dragic revived his career just in time to earn a new contract. He was a Kia Sixth Man Award candidate in the regular season and then, as a starter, led the Heat in scoring through the first three rounds of the playoffs. But Dragic suffered another injury in The Finals and will turn 35 next May. The Heat may be looking to preserve their cap space for 2021 and Kendrick Nunn could eventually take the starting job back. So a lucrative, one-year deal seems like a logical solution, though it would be interesting if Dragic is looking for something long-term. Number to know: Dragic ranked second in the playoffs with 145 total pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions. The 0.84 points per possession he scored as a pick-and-roll ball-handler ranked just 19th among 26 players with at least 35 postseason ball-handler possessions. Related free agent:  Jae Crowder (MIA) \u2014 Crowder is the other Heat starter who\u2019s an unrestricted free agent. The trade that brought him to Miami worked out for both the team \u2014 playing Crowder at the four allowed Miami to open up its offense \u2014 and the player. After shooting 29.3% from 3-point range with Memphis, he shot 44.5% with the Heat and probably earned himself a bigger payday. Bogdanovic is the kind of scorer and playmaker that a team with a 14-year playoff drought should want to keep around. But the 27-year-old plays the same position as the Kings\u2019 highest paid player. Buddy Hield\u2019s four-year, $88 million extension kicks in next season and De\u2019Aaron Fox is eligible to sign his own extension. Committing a ton of money to three backcourt guys might be a tough thing for a team, led by new general manager Monte McNair, that finished in 12th place this season. Number to know: Bogdanovic shot 49.5% from mid-range, the seventh best mark among 84 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts. Related free agent:  Kent Bazemore (SAC) \u2014 Bazemore is a cheaper option, a better defender, and only three years older than Bogdanovic. Wood came into the league in 2015 with the 10-72 Sixers, spent the entire 2017-18 season in the NBA G League, and had never played 200 total minutes for a single NBA team before getting an opportunity with the Pistons this season. But he made the most of that opportunity, finishing fourth in Kia Sixth Man Award voting and eighth in Kia Most Improved Player voting. Wood can finish at the rim (his 77% in the restricted area ranked second among 102 players with at least 200 restricted area attempts) and shoot from the perimeter (39% on 140 3-point attempts). And though he\u2019s bounced around the league for five years, he\u2019s still just 25 years old. Number to know: Wood was one of four players to play at least 1,000 minutes, shoot 55% or better, and average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds per 36. Related free agent:  Harry Giles (SAC) \u2014 A year ago, the Kings declined the fourth-year option on Giles\u2019 rookie contract, making him an unrestricted free agent this summer. He has an injury history and has yet to realize his potential, but Giles is just 22 years old and has shown flashes of being a useful big on both ends of the floor. He could flourish with better health and more experience in the right environment. Bertans is the definition of \u201cinstant offense\u201d in that he\u2019s probably going to shoot the instant he touches the ball, even if he\u2019s 30 feet from the basket. Though he came off the bench, Bertans led the league with 7.4 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts per game. The 43.1% he shot on those catch-and-shoot 3-pointers ranked 11th among 81 players who attempted at least 200. High release. High volume. High efficiency. With the biggest payday of his career likely in the balance and the Wizards having little chance of making the playoffs, Bertans opted out of the NBA restart. He\u2019s obviously a good fit alongside John Wall and Bradley Beal in Washington, but every team needs shooting. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, Bertans led the league with 65 3-pointers in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 11 more than any other player. Related free agent:  Joe Harris (BKN) \u2014 Of the three guards who led the Nets in scoring ( total points ) this season, Harris is obviously the best complement for Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. But he\u2019s an unrestricted free agent, while Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert are under contract. Nets general manager Sean Marks has said that re-signing Harris is \u201cpriority No. 1,\u201d but the 28-year-old will surely have multiple suitors when free agency opens. Anthony had his moments with the Blazers after a full year out of the league. But, even playing alongside Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, he wasn\u2019t very efficient in his role. His true shooting percentage of 52.5% ranked 205th among 248 players with at least 300 field goal attempts in the regular season. Anthony was also one reason why the Blazers were the league\u2019s worst defensive team (by a wide margin) after Christmas . There\u2019s value in having guys who can get to their shot late in the clock, but it would be interesting to see what kind of role the 36-year-old Anthony would have next season if Trevor Ariza, Zach Collins, Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr. are relatively healthy. Number to know: Anthony took 37% of his shots from mid-range, the second highest rate among 248 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. The 39.9% he shot from mid-range ranked 60th among 84 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts. Related free agent:  Paul Millsap (DEN) \u2014 The Nuggets don\u2019t reach the conference finals without Millsap\u2019s performance in Game 5 against the Clippers, and Denver was much, much better defensively with him on the floor in the regular season. But the 35-year-old seemingly showed his age in the bubble, and the Nuggets have both Jerami Grant (who has a $9.3 million player option) and Michael Porter Jr. to play alongside Nikola Jokic on that frontline. Howard gave the Lakers critical minutes in their conference finals series victory over Denver, but wasn\u2019t much of a factor in their other three series. JaVale McGee can opt into one more year with the Lakers, Markieff Morris is also an unrestricted free agent, and Davis will obviously play some minutes at the five. It will be fascinating to see if the champs run it back with that same frontline or look to shuffle the deck. Three of their perimeter rotation guys \u2014 Avery Bradley, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Rajon Rondo \u2014 also have player options. Number to know: Howard ranked fifth in the regular season (12.8%) and second in the playoffs (11.5%) in offensive rebounding percentage among players who averaged at least 15 minutes per game. Related free agent:  Tristan Thompson (CLE) \u2014 If the Lakers want to get five years younger (and less foul-prone) with that spot on their roster, here\u2019s another center that LeBron James has won a title with. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

As much as I loved seeing coaches in sweat suits, as curious as I am about why the shooting background of the bubble gyms were preferable to arena crowds for many players, I\u2019d like to see some lessening of the travel grind when play resumes. That might mean keeping a road team in the same city for a pair of games (if it doesn\u2019t make ticket-selling more difficult). At the very last, making sure to exploit two-team markets in L.A. and New York, hitting both the Lakers\/Clippers and Knicks\/Nets on one visit. Nearby markets too (which often occurs) \u2014 Chicago and Milwaukee, Orlando and Miami, Sacramento and Golden State. We get consecutive games in one site in the playoffs, so it\u2019s worth trying \u2014 to reduce flights and odd sleeping hours \u2014 as much as the schedule will allow. Shaun Powell :  I like 10-minute quarters for exhibition games, the option for coaches to dress down, the names below the numbers on the backs of jerseys and the ample space along the baselines and sidelines. Of course, once normalcy returns, the teams will be too anxious to get $$ from courtside fans, so there\u2019s no chance of that latter request happening. John Schuhmann :  The dress code for coaches and staff. This is sports! Polos and khakis are more suitable than suits and ties. I also think that quality of the offenses should have the league continuing its effort to reduce travel during the season . Alas, if there\u2019s not a reduction in the number of games, I\u2019m not sure how that happens beyond longer stays in New York and L.A. Sekou Smith : Nothing on the court. The competition between the lines in the bubble was every bit as energized as anything we\u2019ve seen in home arenas. Another collective tip of the cap to the competitive nature of the teams and players involved is necessary. That said, I imagine that the powers that be noticed that the absence of the normal travel back and forth during a series proved extremely beneficial on game nights. There is substantial wear and tear involved in a long regular season followed by a rigorous postseason. Any opportunity to mitigate some of that wear and tear must to be top of mind as the parties negotiate the road ahead. The social distancing on the benches seems like it has to be a permanent change in the post-Covid-19 world. And finally, the relaxed dress code for coaches and players who are not in uniform was a welcome sight. It made for a much more comfortable feel inside the arenas for whatever reason. Michael C. Wright :  Two small changes \u2014 virtual fans and the relaxed dress code for coaches \u2014 should stick beyond this season, if possible. Obviously, the NBA wants to be playing games this upcoming season in front of packed houses. But if it can\u2019t initially, let\u2019s bring back the virtual fans, and perhaps the league could do more outreach in terms of informing the fans how they can actually get into these virtual seats. Even if arenas are full next season, maybe there\u2019s some type of \u201cvirtual section\u201d that could be pulled off. Maybe shots of virtual fans can run across the ribbon boards at arenas that often display advertising. Inside the bubble, the virtual fans were a nice touch. And if you\u2019re a Lakers fan in New York that can\u2019t get to the games at the Staples Center, what better way to represent than to be a virtual fan? As for the dress code for coaches, I\u2019m not advocating for it to be relaxed for all games permanently. Maybe the coaches should be required to wear suits only for nationally televised games and the postseason."},{"id":196208,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bubble-wrap-most-surprising-thing-2020-playoffs","date":"2020-10-13","title":"Bubble Wrap: The most surprising thing of the playoffs was ...?","content":"* * * What was the most unusual or surprising thing that happened this postseason? * * * Steve Aschburner : The Clippers coughing up a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference semifinals. Seriously? With that roster, that coaching staff and those expectations? The Lakers\u2019 Staples Center roommates, losing three in a row when many thought they would beat LeBron & Co. to reach The Finals, is one of the NBA\u2019s biggest choke jobs of this century. It cost Doc Rivers his job, dinged Paul George\u2019s reputation (\u201cPlayoff P\u201d indeed) and had some critics recasting Kawhi Leonard\u2019s decision to leave Toronto as all about his lifestyle. Based on when it was announced, the Executive of the Year award to GM Lawrence Frank also wound up looking silly, given Lakers GM Rob Pelinka\u2019s roster moves around James. Even with Rivers\u2019 head-scratching record in Game 7s and knack for blowing three times a 3-1 playoff series lead, this was a stunner to me. Shaun Powell :  Maybe that there actually was a postseason? Or that it came to a halt because of the Bucks? In the purest sense, perhaps the collapse by the Clippers. That egg-laying after a 3-1 lead over the Nuggets left the franchise devastated. And the fallout was severe when Doc Rivers departed \u201cby mutual interest.\u201d Surely owner Steve Ballmer was (and still is?) livid over how his team behaved (\u201cLemon Pepper\u201d Lou, the laughing at the expense of Damian Lillard) and definitely how it performed. This time next summer, the Clippers could be a total wreck if Kawhi Leonard and Paul George bail because the team\u2019s future belongs to Oklahoma City. John Schuhmann : Besides the fact that it took place in a bubble with no fans? How about that it was probably the most efficient postseason ever? Over the 83 playoff games, teams combined to score 110.8 points per 100 possessions, the highest mark of the 24 postseasons for which we have play-by-play data (and likely NBA history). Regular-season efficiency hit an all-time high of 110.1 points per 100 possessions this year, but it was fair to believe that offense would suffer from a 20-week layoff. That was the case with the Lakers through Game 1 of the first round, but overall, offenses were sharp, despite the layoff and the unique environment. A larger-than-usual jump in the percentage of shots coming from 3-point range (from 38.4% in the regular season to 42.7% in the playoffs) was a factor. A jump in efficiency from the regular season to the playoffs isn\u2019t unusual (it\u2019s happened in 12 of the last 24 years), but it\u2019s noteworthy that it happened given the circumstances and how efficiently the league scored in the regular season. Sekou Smith : The LA Clippers entered the bubble as the favorite to win it all and exited the competition with an Executive of the Year honor for Lawrence Frank as the only tangible highlight. The Clippers\u2019 collapse after taking a 3-1 lead over Denver in the conference semifinals should be an instructional video for how not to manage the pressure and expectations that come with contender status. The Clippers parted ways with Doc Rivers (who quickly got the Sixers\u2019 coaching job). Stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are facing increased scrutiny within their own locker room and beyond while the makeup of this roster looms as a question marks as they enter the offseason without a coach. Put it this way: Before the confetti fell on the Lakers\u2019 Finals-clinching win over Miami, the Clippers\u2019 supposed takeover of the L.A. basketball throne was already ashes. Their meltdown was so thorough that most of us forgot that Milwaukee\u2019s brutal bubble collapse happened in the same postseason. Michael C. Wright : Obviously, that moment came in August when the players decided to  take a step back to reiterate their support of the Black Lives Matter movement and their stance on racial injustice and police brutality after Jacob Blake was gunned down from behind by police in Kenosha, Wisc. The league postponed playoff matchups between Milwaukee and Orlando, Houston and Oklahoma City and Portland and the Los Angeles Lakers. Doing so created an encouraging domino effect in pro sports as the WNBA and Major League Baseball also postponed games. Their actions and words put more of a spotlight on the injustices taking place in the United States, and with pro sports cancelled, all fans were forced to at least pay attention. The NBA players entered the bubble wanting to use their platform for good, and it appears they accomplished that with this moment."},{"id":196214,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bubble-wrap-who-established-legit-star","date":"2020-10-13","title":"Bubble Wrap: Who became a legit star in the bubble?","content":"* * * Which player established himself as a legit NBA star inside the bubble? * * * Steve Aschburner : Jamal Murray. Heading into this season, right up to the playoffs, Murray was considered a potential star for Denver. A guy who, someday, might chase a scoring title. But after a slow bubble start, Murray took flight. He thrived in a first-round duel with Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell, twice scoring 50 points to lead the Denver Nuggets\u2019 comeback from a 3-1 series hole. He outplayed Paul George, if not Kawhi Leonard, when they did it again against the LA Clippers. Then he averaged 25 points while making 52 percent of his shots in the Western Conference finals against the Lakers. The 23-year-old Canadian, who had boosted his scoring from 2018-19 to the 2019 playoffs by 3.1 ppg, topped himself by morphing from an 18.5 ppg guy to 26.5 ppg in Denver\u2019s three rounds this time. The respect and expectations for Murray will be jacked higher whenever 2020-21 begins. Shaun Powell :  While Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell and Luka Doncic certainly had their moments, Jamal Murray leaps to mind. He emerged as a certified offensive force. The Nuggets had been waiting for this to happen and it did, suddenly and spectacularly. His ability to shoot from distance, hit from mid range, attack the rim, command the double team and gain respect was very vivid and real. His defense needs to come around. However, he\u2019ll be on the preseason Kia MVP watch list for 2020-21. LeBron James didn\u2019t have a poor game or terrible moment or any lapse from the steep level he built for himself. It seems like an easy answer, choosing the Finals MVP for this question, but he simply outlasted all other bubble MVP candidates (Murray, Damian Lillard), and that must stand for something. John Schuhmann :  Jamal Murray established himself as a real off-the-dribble threat, the type that will challenge the way most of the league defends pick-and-rolls. With Nikola Jokic, Murray and Michael Porter Jr. (25, 23 and 22 years old), the Nuggets have three complementary talents who should have them playing top-five offense for years to come. Donovan Mitchell\u2019s star turn, though it came with a smaller sample size , was similarly intriguing. The talent has always been there, but there was a whole new level of efficiency in his postseason performance. His effective field goal percentage of 61.9% on pull-up jumpers was the best mark among 23 players who attempted at least 50 in the playoffs. He also shot 95% on 8.3 free throw attempts per game . Those numbers aren\u2019t sustainable, but if Mitchell has taken a step forward in regard to both his off-the-dribble shooting and his ability to get to the line, he is a star at just 23 years old. Sekou Smith : I don\u2019t even know if he was in the conversation before the bubble, but no one did more for his Q rating in Orlando than Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray . He went from blazing hot scorer against Utah to a man on a mission in that upset of the Clippers to a full-blown performance artist in the Western Conference finals against the eventual-champion Lakers. We knew Murray was talented, but we had never seen him prove it on the playoff stage as he did for the Nuggets in the bubble. Nikola Jokic was already a legit star, a first team All-NBA center and one of the most difficult individual matchups in the league. Murray\u2019s rise, however, turns the Nuggets into a legitimate contender for the foreseeable future, especially with younger talents like Michael Porter Jr. and Bol Bol in the same player development program. What this playoff run has done for Murray\u2019s confidence won\u2019t be clear until the next season starts. But I\u2019ll have my popcorn ready to watch that show. Michael C. Wright : Honestly, he was a star before the NBA bubble, but Jamal Murray showed everybody why the Denver Nuggets will be in the mix to win titles for years to come. Suiting up in the playoffs for just the second time in his career, Murray, 23, cooked up 50-pieces twice in the postseason and made it a point to continue speaking up for social justice causes in the wake of a signature performance in Game 6 against the Utah Jazz. When Denver stunned the Clippers in the West semifinals, Murray racked up 40 points in the deciding Game 7. The Lakers took out the Nuggets in five games in the conference finals with Murray struggling to perform due to a bone bruise in his foot. But there\u2019s no way Denver gets there without Murray carrying the Nuggets in the playoffs when needed."},{"id":196207,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bubble-wrap-who-was-mvp-inside-bubble","date":"2020-10-13","title":"Bubble Wrap: Who was the MVP inside the bubble?","content":"* * * The Most Valuable Player inside the bubble was __________. * * * Steve Aschburner : Jimmy Butler . Look, LeBron James is the more obvious choice for what he\u2019s credited with doing on and off the court, as well as for the trophies with which he walked off the floor Sunday night. But I\u2019m applying the same standards to this question as I apply to Kia MVP ballots. Having two MVP candidates on the same roster limits each of their cases, in my view. Take either James or Davis out of L.A.\u2019s lineup, the Lakers still can beat a lot of teams. Take Butler out of Miami\u2019s and they\u2019re done after eight seeding games. Better yet, keep Butler in the lineup while removing Goran Dragic and hampering Bam Adebayo, and you still get a Heat team pushing to six games a Lakers squad flaunting two of the league\u2019s best players. Butler\u2019s triple-doubles in Games 3 and 5 gave the NBA\u2019s TV partners more earning opportunities and fanned some fan flames that might have been flickering with a sweep. Shaun Powell :  LeBron James didn\u2019t have a poor game or terrible moment or any lapse from the steep level he built for himself. It seems like an easy answer, choosing the Finals MVP for this question, but he simply outlasted all other bubble MVP candidates (Damian Lillard, Jamal Murray, Luka Doncic), and that must stand for something. John Schuhmann : There are cases to be made for Jimmy Butler (for a couple of huge games in The Finals) and Anthony Davis (for two-way play), but the Heat\u2019s success was more of an ensemble affair and Davis took a back seat in the Lakers\u2019 offense at times. LeBron James never took a back seat and was, simply, the best player on a team that went 16-5 in the postseason. James\u2019 own offense was a reason the Lakers got off to a slow start in the bubble, but there shouldn\u2019t have been any doubt about his ability to turn it up in the postseason. His jumper will always come and go, but his ability to get to the basket (he scored 76 more points in the restricted area than Davis in the playoffs) hasn\u2019t diminished with age, and this was probably his best defensive season since he was in Miami. Sekou Smith : Since he\u2019s clearly not a fan of the narrative nature of awards season, I\u2019m sure it will pain LeBron James to know that he\u2019s the glaringly obvious pick here for that very reason. You know the script: legendary talent in his 17th season, leads the league in assists , guides the historic franchise (which had not won a title in a decade) out of the darkest time in the organization\u2019s history in a tumultuous, longest-ever season that ends with them securing banner No. 17. If there were any doubters left before this fourth title run for LeBron, they\u2019d be wise to lay down their arms now. The guy has earned his status as the best player on the planet and one of the truly greatest to ever do it, whether you agree with his methods or not. Three franchises, four titles, four Finals MVPs and the most recent one coming in an unprecedented environment that none of his Mount Rushmore brethren had ever dealt with strengthens his case. No player in the bubble impacted the culture or bottom line for his franchise greater than LeBron (though Jimmy Butler is a close second). Michael C. Wright : If you asked this question two weeks ago, it would have been Damian Lillard, no question. But Jimmy Butler catapulted himself into this spot with the grit he displayed in The Finals. In five of the six games, Butler played at least 43:26, and in Game 5, he played all but 48 seconds. We all saw the camera shots of Butler exhausted with seemingly nothing left to give throughout the series. But he kept coming back for more and finding ways to win without necessarily filling it up in terms of scoring. Butler\u2019s leadership proved contagious for an undermanned Miami Heat squad in The Finals, and it was almost heartbreaking after Sunday\u2019s Game 6 loss to hear him say, \u201cI didn\u2019t hold up my end of the bargain.\u201d Yes, you did, Jimmy. Yes, you did."},{"id":196212,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bubble-wrap-can-miami-heat-return-finals-2021","date":"2020-10-13","title":"Bubble Wrap: Will Miami's path to The Finals in 2021 be easier or harder?","content":"* * * Will Miami\u2019s path to The Finals in 2021 be easier or harder than in 2020? * * * Steve Aschburner : Harder . Nothing seems to get easier about NBA competition, at least in a relative sense. I mean, it\u2019s easier for a ball handler to get where he wants to go without hand-checking anymore. But as far as vying for the same goals, there is zero reason to think the Heat will cake-walk to the 2021 Finals. The top East teams that got ousted this time \u2014 the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers and Brooklyn Nets \u2014 will have made changes or be lugging greater urgency next time. Milwaukee might be out-of-its-mind desperate to win big to retain Giannis Antetokounmpo. Doc Rivers accepted a win-now pressure in Philadelphia. Brad Stevens\u2019 days as a wunderkind coach are over \u2014 it\u2019s payoff time. And so on. Fortunately for Miami, it will be better too. But nothing will come more easily. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019ll be much harder for the Heat if only because of the potential monster that\u2019s emerging in Brooklyn with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving healthy. Also, unlike this time, Miami will need to win some tough road games. The Heat\u2019s chances actually will look better for the 2021-22 season, assuming they take advantage of their ample cap space in that offseason to find an A-list talent to join their youthful core. John Schuhmann :  More difficult. Brooklyn is adding two of the most talented players in the league, Boston\u2019s two young stars are only getting better and Philadelphia might be able to figure things out under Rivers. Goran Dragic and Jae Crowder are free agents, but Miami has the payroll flexibility to make tweaks, and its own young players (Bam Adebayo is 22! Tyler Herro is 20!) should continue to improve. The Heat will be right there among the contenders, but things might not break for them as well as they did these last two months. Sekou Smith :  Much harder. The surprise factor for the Heat evaporated with each and every dominant effort they delivered in their run to The Finals. There will be increased expectations across the board, from Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo on down the roster. The benefit of having a tight-knit group carrying its underdog role into an isolated environment won\u2019t be on the Miami\u2019s side in 2021 (or at least not that we know of). The \u201cHeat culture\u201d that fueled this run must be even stronger when we discover to what our new NBA normal is. Michael C. Wright :  It\u2019s definitely going to be more difficult. We saw in the bubble that the Brooklyn Nets have a nice, young squad \u2014 and that was without Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in the mix. Brooklyn will be better, as will Philadelphia under Rivers, as he figures out ways to make the Joel Embiid-Ben Simmons pairing work. Let\u2019s also not forget about Toronto, Boston and Milwaukee. All three of those teams are legit title contenders. Obviously, Miami now has NBA Finals experience that will serve it well moving forward, but the East is quickly becoming a gauntlet, and I personally can\u2019t wait to see what the offseason brings for some of these teams."},{"id":196205,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bubble-wrap-can-la-lakers-return-finals-2021","date":"2020-10-13","title":"Bubble Wrap: Will the Lakers' path to The Finals in 2021 be easier or harder?","content":"* * * Will the Lakers\u2019 path to The Finals in 2021 be easier or harder than in 2020? * * * Steve Aschburner : Harder . This league is all about continuous improvement, unless it happens to be about injury. That\u2019s the mode Golden State was in this season, gone ghost by the injuries to Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. The Warriors will be healed, fresh and toting a high Draft pick with instant aspirations to reclaim their conference dominance. Denver wants nothing less than a Finals trip in 2021, Dallas might have been the team upsetting the Clippers if not for Kristaps Porzingis\u2019 injury, and there always are expectations in Houston, Utah and Portland. Meanwhile, LeBron James will be a year old \u2014 wait, that\u2019s meaningless now. But his and the Lakers\u2019 rivals will be more formidable. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019ll be harder. Understand that every title contender from this past year will be just as good if not better next season. And now you add the healthy Warriors and Nets and it\u2019s a crowded field. The Lakers could loom as greater threats the following year, especially if Giannis Antetokounmpo or another A-list free agent signs up to help LeBron go out in style. John Schuhmann :  More difficult. The Lakers certainly earned that title, but the West should be stronger next season with the return of the Warriors and continued growth from teams like Denver, Dallas and even Phoenix. And with some lessons learned and improved chemistry, the LA Clippers should be more than just an in-theory championship contender next season. Sekou Smith :  Harder, but for reasons that are beyond the Lakers\u2019 control. The pack in the Western Conference is always chasing the top dog and it will be no different in 2020-21. There\u2019s plenty of competition gearing up for a shot at knocking the Lakers off their championship perch, starting with whatever team rises from the ashes that are the Clippers. Plus, there\u2019s still Denver, Dallas, Utah, Houston, Portland, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Phoenix and anyone else hoping to catch LeBron on the other side of 35. The Lakers\u2019 championship window is open, though \u2026 as long as LeBron and AD stay as healthy and engaged as they were this time around. Michael C. Wright :  Harder, for sure. You forget about them because we didn\u2019t see them in the bubble, but the Golden State Warriors haven\u2019t gone anywhere (and they\u2019ve got the No. 2 pick in the upcoming Draft). Then, you\u2019ve got the Clippers and the Rockets, which need to figure out what they\u2019re going to do moving forward as the championship window for James Harden and Russell Westbrook is quickly closing. Dallas is emerging as a threat in the West with Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, and we all saw how formidable Denver will be for years to come with two superstars in Murray and Nikola Jokic. It\u2019s unfortunate Oklahoma City lost coach Billy Donovan to Chicago, but the young Thunder are on the come-up, too. Utah and Portland should also be threats next season. So, the West definitely hasn\u2019t gotten any easier."},{"id":164505,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-things-learned-2020-finals-game-6","date":"2020-10-12","title":"5 things we learned from Game 6 of 2020 Finals","content":" Five things we learned from the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 2019-20 NBA championship run, clinched with their 106-93 victory over the Miami Heat in Game 6 Sunday in the Orlando bubble: * * * Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Los Angeles NBA franchise that Mom always liked best had gone a whole 10 years without winning a championship. Boo-freaking-hoo, right? Twenty-four of the league\u2019s 30 teams have waited longer than that. It\u2019s been 12 years for the Boston Celtics, whom the Lakers tied Sunday with 17 championships . It\u2019s been 16 years for Detroit, 22 for Chicago, 25 for Houston. You\u2019d have to be well into your 40s to remember anything you saw when Philadelphia last won, pushing 50 for favorite moments from Seattle\u2019s, Washington\u2019s or Portland\u2019s lone title runs. The Knicks haven\u2019t won in 47 years, back before Larry O\u2019Brien was a commissioner, never mind a trophy. It\u2019s been 49 for the Bucks. And then there are the 11 Oliver Twist franchises still holding out their empty bowls, hoping for a taste: Brooklyn, Charlotte, Denver, Indiana, the LA Clippers, Memphis, Minnesota, New Orleans, Orlando, Phoenix and Utah. Then there are the Lakers and their fans, suffering from their first-world problem of a decade between rings. As if it\u2019s their birthright or something \u2026 Except, y\u2019know, it kind of is. This franchise was racking up championships \u2014 five of \u2018em \u2014 back when its nickname made sense, in Minneapolis, in the first half of the 1950s. Those Lakers teams had the game\u2019s biggest star and its dominant big man \u2014 it just so happened that George Mikan filled the roles divvied between LeBron James and Anthony Davis on this year\u2019s winners. The real drought came then, dry enough that the Lakers relocated to southern California, unpleasant enough with Bill Russell\u2019s Boston Celtics catching and passing them for 11 titles in 13 years. The Lakers took their lumps directly, too, losing seven times in The Finals to Boston. It would be 18 years overall before Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain put an end to it, beating New York in 1972. The count at that point was Celtics 11, Lakers 6. Then 13-7 a few years later. The Lakers gained ground in the Magic Johnson\/Larry Bird 80s to get within 16-11. Then Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant, under Phil Jackson, strung together three in a row from 2000 to 2002. Bryant, Jackson and Pau Gasol won two more in 2009 and 2010, a pair that the Celtics had their eyes on after winning in 2008. Now James, Davis and the others have capped a 6-1 run over the past 20 seasons to catch Boston at 17 championships each. Nobody else is close \u2014 the Bulls and the Warriors have won six titles, the Spurs five \u2014 and based on James\u2019 stalemate with Father Time and his new BFF\u2019s prime, the gap might actually widen in the next few years.  You might find Michael Jordan\u2019s name trending on social media, in spite of His Airness\u2019 last ring coming in the last century, because that\u2019s how it goes nowadays when James does, er, almost anything. For now, our view here was best expressed by Sekou Smith in the immediate aftermath of Game 6: We\u2019ll focus here on a couple of superlatives that are beyond quibbling. No argument, no debate. The first is that no player in NBA history has done more for player empowerment by seizing control of his career arc and leading three different organizations to championships. Some will cite his Finals MVP trophies in Miami (2), Cleveland and now Los Angeles to distinguish him from guys such as Danny Green and Robert Horry, but the word \u201clead\u201d covers that. James led on the court and off in orchestrating the titles he and his teams won with the Heat (Big Three), the Cavs (Big Three 2.0) and the Lakers. Is that a greater feat than winning four times in one place as the top star? That, after all, is an uber-elite club populated by Russell, Jordan and Magic Johnson or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (depending on how you slice the alpha dog duties). James has been honest, at least, about having to go to Miami to a) learn from Pat Riley\u2019s vaunted \u201cculture\u201d how to win and b) do it somewhere sidekicks and supporting cast members actually would want to live and play. By the time he got back to Cleveland, he had nailed down \u201ca\u201d and could skip \u201cb,\u201d with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in place as the Monster Cavs\u2019 other two heads. Four more Finals trips and that improbable 2016 title after a 3-1 Golden State series lead probably stand as James\u2019 greatest accomplishments. With the Lakers, James targeted a glamour market again and an elite teammate whom his reputation and his agency, Klutch, could leverage out of New Orleans a year earlier than Davis\u2019 contract would have allowed. No regrets, no apologies from James, despite Davis\u2019 dubious ethics in forcing the trade. He was too busy being superstar, GM and POBO for that. The second claim to fame that is James\u2019 alone is that he reigns as the NBA\u2019s monarch of body maintenance. No one else in the game\u2019s history has done what he\u2019s done as well as and as long as James has done it. He has benefitted from playing at a time of the most advanced training, conditioning, nutritional and psychological techniques ever. His genetics have put those things to use in a 6-foot-9, 260-pound package, his finances have put it all at his fingertips and his work ethic has driven him to miss zero beats in going machine on the rest of the league. James has had the role models and achievements of those who came before him to use as targets. The four months of lockdown had to have helped him physically, bubble or not, in creating a quick ramp to the postseason. Where some rivals saw the Orlando restart as an ordeal, James never lost sight of what it offered as an opportunity. If the NBA\u2019s doomsday scenario always was going to be James testing positive during the playoffs, well, that was James\u2019 too. Yet here we are, imagining James continuing at his current productivity and passion over the next couple of years. That\u2019s much easier than picturing a drop-off of 25 percent one year, 50 percent the next, the way we would for mere mortal 36- and 37-year-olds. James couldn\u2019t round up two additional stars for the Lakers \u2014 Kawhi Leonard preferred the other end of the hall at Staples Center \u2014 but one was plenty. Davis, the moment he got his desired trade out of New Orleans, hurt both his own and James\u2019 cases as MVP candidates \u2014 how valuable does one have to be when the other one is there as backup? \u2014 but dramatically improved their prospects of doing exactly what we saw Sunday. Davis\u2019 versatility in a slightly longer, somewhat more slender package is a lot like James, in the ways he can hurt opponents offensively and guard multiple positions. Though less adept as a passer, he adds a level of rim protection James only shows in his flashy chase-down blocks. There was a reason Miami managed only 36 points by halftime of the clincher, and his initials are AD. What we don\u2019t know about Davis is whether he could ever fulfill the hopes and dreams the Pelicans had for him \u2014 leading a team to a championship as its best player. His frequent wincing and grabbing at various body parts, on top of his injury history before this season, will keep him in a durability category far from James, until proven otherwise. But as a second threat for whom foes have to game-plan, with pure MVP talent better than most teams\u2019 No. 1, Davis is what we all expected and all those other teams feared. Scottie Pippen wasn\u2019t diminished when he couldn\u2019t pick up the baton Jordan dropped at his feet. One of these years in the distant future perhaps, after James\u2019 tutelage, we\u2019ll see how Davis does at that task. The gap between James\u2019 and Davis\u2019 skill sets is narrower than between Davis\u2019 and anyone else\u2019s on the Lakers roster. But it would be a mistake not to mention teammates, only a few of whom merely hitched a ride to a ring. Like Rajon Rondo , the veteran guard who earned a special place in the Lakers-Celtics rivalry by becoming only the second player to win titles with each franchise. (Clyde Lovellete did it the Minneapolis incarnation in 1954 and with Boston in 1963 and 1964.) He was sought as a roster addition by James himself, and used his postseason experience and savvy to drive and bail out the Lakers on some playoff nights. Former No. 1 pick Dwight Howard had been sort of the anti-LeBron, gaining notoriety for all the franchises he could not lead to a championship. Then he honed his game down to the basics \u2014 defense and rebounding \u2014 as a strong role player this season. Danny Green, a solid citizen whose missed 3-pointer that could have won Game 5 threatened to linger, shook all stigma off in 48 hours. Most fair-minded folks, if they knew the outcome was assured but the score would be tighter, would have pulled for Green to get a reset late Sunday. Yes, J.R. Smith gets another ring now. But Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Alex Caruso and Markieff Morris earned their first. Then there\u2019s Kostas Antetkounmpo, one of Milwaukee MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s younger brothers, who logged all of 20 minutes and seven points for the Lakers this season. Kostas has bragging rights on big bro for the moment. It\u2019s true that a relative select group of NBA franchises have won the championship \u2014 eight have hogged 60 since the league\u2019s inception. The parallel for NBA coaches is even more exclusive. Of the 332 men who have been NBA head coaches, only 34 have won at least one championship. That\u2019s just barely 10 percent. Six guys \u2014 Phil Jackson (11), Red Auerbach (9), John Kundla (5), Pat Riley (5), Gregg Popovich (5) and Steve Kerr (3) \u2014 account for 38, just over half all-time. Frank Vogel went from nose pressed against the glass to being comfortably distanced from all the win-nots by becoming the seventh active coach to steer an NBA champion across the finish line. For now, he\u2019s the 20th to win exactly once, though that\u2019s subject to change. Vogel, 47, did it by stressing the basic of defense and positivity. He never tried to show his Lakers stars how smart he was, though he was plenty, and never had a moment\u2019s friction \u2013 publicly, anyway \u2013 with James. That\u2019s no easy feat. The former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Rick Pitino and video coordinator for the Celtics comes across as egoless, at times to the point of deference to his players, especially LeBron. But he also is working with an older, more self-assured James than were any of the star\u2019s six previous coaches. Staying the course is a skill for a coach during any NBA season, particular the longest. It showed itself most tangibly in the Lakers\u2019 impressive 57-0 mark when leading through three quarters. Closing out games without hiccups, navigating the timeouts and the replay reviews and the rest, starts at the top of most coaching staffs. In previous stops, Vogel had made his bones in Indiana, then looked adrift in Orlando. With the Lakers, Vogel wasn\u2019t even the first choice for the job \u2014 Tyronn Lue turned it down \u2014 but he proved he was the right choice. Their bubble done burst early Sunday night, with a deficit of 30 points by halftime that made the final score, 106-93, extremely misleading. The Heat tanks were empty, once and for all, and it showed. Game 6 was over almost before it had begun. The Finals finale was more coronation than competition, but there really was nothing for Miami to be ashamed about. The Heat punched above their weight from the conference semifinals onward, dispatching Milwaukee and outworking Boston to end its \u201cdrought\u201d between championship series at a mere six years. The scrappy crew didn\u2019t have the pedigree of the Lakers\u2019 roster. Even when point guard Goran Dragic and center Bam Adebayo missed nearly all of the series and two games, respectively, coach Erik Spoelstra never sought or used any excuses. Jimmy Butler posted triple-doubles in Game 3 and 5 that had fans in Chicago, Minnesota and Philadelphia bemoaning the version of Butler they\u2019d had. Butler established himself as a household NBA name by averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, 9.8 assists and shooting 55.2% in the series. The Heat clearly have keepers in Adebayo and precocious scorer Tyler Herro, with role players who responded in Jae Crowder, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn and Kelly Olynyk. There\u2019s no reason, considering what they did and what their rivals did not, that the Heat shouldn\u2019t be seen as East favorites when 2020-21 commences. With its current roster, its \u201cculture\u201d that might induce eye rolls but gets results and the relentless ambitions of Pat Riley, the Godfather, in the upstairs office, the Heat look to be a contender into the near future. Despite playing only eight game over .500 since 2013-14 and missing the playoffs three times in five seasons prior to this one, Miami still has that built-in advantage as one of the league\u2019s most alluring, \u201cdestination\u201d markets for free agents. Only a few other locales offer that on a reliable basis. The bubble of central Florida, not so much. But Miami did its job and Los Angeles did theirs. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

As a second-year pro, a 21-year-old Rondo teamed with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen to lift the Boston Celtics to their 17th NBA championship in the 2008 Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cI had a lot of great teammates early, great coaching staffs early, and I thought that\u2019s what the NBA was,\u201d he said. Twelve years and plenty of potholes in the road later, Rondo conjured up his unique brand of postseason magic in Game 6 of the NBA Finals to help the Lakers down the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday for, coincidentally, their 17th title. Rondo joins Clyde Lovellette (MPL Lakers and Boston Celtics) in becoming just the second player in league history to win NBA championships with both the Celtics and the Lakers. \u201cThis one, by far, is the hardest one,\u201d Rondo said. Yet Rondo orchestrated his contributions to Sunday\u2019s triumph with relative ease. Rondo drilled 6-for-6 shots from the field and 1-of-1 from deep for 13 points in the first half to go with four rebounds and two assists, as Los Angeles built a 64-36 halftime advantage, which registers as the second-largest lead at intermission in Finals history. In the second quarter alone, Rondo lit up the Heat for 9 points on 4-for-4 shooting, including 1-for-1 from 3-point range as Los Angeles outscored Miami 36-16. But even with the Lakers up 30 points in the third quarter, Rondo could be seen screaming at teammates and directing traffic as a way of guiding the franchise\u2019s 17 championship to the finish line. \u201cWe knew Miami wasn\u2019t going to quit,\u201d said Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who chipped in 17 points. \u201cWe have seen it before. Just watching their other series, they came back [from] down 19 or 20 in the fourth, and Rondo recognized that. And Rondo is great, you know, [a] coach and player on the court. \u201cHe gets us in the right spots and made sure we were in the mindset of just keep attacking, finish the game and don\u2019t let up. He enforced that tonight, and we all just bought into it, and we got the [win].\u201d Rondo\u2019s approach to Game 6 serves as testament to how much he values what he\u2019s learned over the years. Such opportunities are rare and fleeting. Having played with the Celtics his first nine NBA seasons (2006-14), Rondo earned NBA All-Star recognition on four occasions, in addition to being named to the All-Defensive Team four times. He\u2019s led the league in assists twice, and once in steals. But the victory over the Heat on Sunday sealed just his second NBA title, coincidentally, for the team Rondo\u2019s Celtics defeated for that title in 2008, which was led at the time by the departed Kobe Bryant. \u201cI got to compete against Kobe Bryant when I was 21,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cSo, his game and his legacy speaks for itself. Me being a kid from Louisville, Kentucky, to be able to compete with Kobe two years into the league, understand and learn so much from him by watching his film and studying his film, it\u2019s definitely an honor. \u201cAnd to come full circle to win in his honor, his daughter\u2019s honor, unbelievable season that we\u2019ve had. And to be able to prevail and stay focused and continue to get the job done, I know something, he\u2019s definitely smiling down on us. We\u2019re able to fulfill our dream and succeed with the championship.\u201d Rondo departed Boston in December 2014 via trade, sent off to the Dallas Mavericks, and struggled to find a fit in the new surroundings. Rondo joined the Sacramento Kings for the 2015-16 season, and later Chicago. By the time Rondo signed with the New Orleans Pelicans for 2017-18, he was playing for his fifth team in four seasons with current Lakers power forward Anthony Davis, who scored 19 points in Sunday\u2019s Game 6 win. \u201cDown the road [in] Year 10, 11, things changed for me in my career,\u201d Rondo explained. \u201cEvery time going into training camp, you weren\u2019t expected to win a championship because of the teams I was on. So, that was a different mindset coming into the season. But to be able to get back to this, this season in particular, understanding that we did have a team to compete for a championship from Day 1, and to be able to come full circle an entire year later, we reached our goal and our dream. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time for me. To be able to come back and redeem myself and play a big part in this championship is definitely a hell of a feeling, and something I\u2019ll remember for the rest of my life.\u201d Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka, meanwhile, discussed Rondo\u2019s impact off the floor in the celebratory locker room. When Los Angeles met Saturday on the heels of its 111-108 loss to the Heat in Game 5, Rondo stepped up and told the team exactly how it would capture a title. \u201cRondo said yesterday in our team meeting, if we\u2019re going to win a championship, it has to be with defense, period,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cI think what we saw tonight was just a defensive showing of force tied together with a great game plan by Frank Vogel and his staff, and so we\u2019re honored to work with a basketball mind like his.\u201d Of course, Rondo\u2019s assertion regarding Los Angeles\u2019 defense proved correct, as the Lakers finished 21-0 this season when holding opponents to fewer than 100 points, including three instances of that in the Finals. After winning his first title as a 21-year old, Rondo and the Celtics fell to Los Angeles in the 2010 NBA Finals. Lakers teammate Dwight Howard (11 years) and Rondo (10 years) have played the second- and third-most years between losing and winning in the NBA Finals, according to Elias Sports Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rocky last couple of seasons,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to the playoffs last year. A couple years ago, a teammate got hurt and excited early in the playoffs. So, just staying the course. Never too high, never too low, and continuing to grind. I pride myself on how hard I work. People that know me know how dedicated I am to the game, and my mind and my body, the work I put in in the offseason, and it\u2019s definitely a blessing to be able to come out and reap the benefits of what I\u2019ve been working for for so long.\u201d Michael C.

For starters, they\u2019ll be amazed to know that a world champion was crowned after arriving at Disney World rather than before. And studies will show such activity occurred in autumn and not summertime when the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy is normally awarded. Mainly, though, there will be compelling and unimpeachable proof that the Los Angeles Lakers had glory restored at the same place and on the same night LeBron James saw his greatness continue. \u201cLaker Nation wants their respect, and I want my damn respect, too,\u201d said the player who claimed his fourth title and also a fourth Finals MVP as a parting gift. This was a joint celebration of a storied franchise and an age-defying superstar, who needed each other, who took a victory lap together with a gallop after winning the series four games to two over the Miami Heat. The Lakers had missed the playoffs entirely the last six years while LeBron watched them from home last summer after a groin injury got the best of him in his first season in LA. But then: Purple and gold confetti fell almost as rapidly as the Heat in a Game 6 that was a LeBron-infused Laker demolition almost from tipoff; they were up 30 before halftime. The team and their leader gave it their all Sunday in a smashing performance, and the only thing the Lakers left was no doubt. That\u2019s 17 titles now for the Lakers, tying the Celtics for the NBA record, and LeBron\u2019s third with as many teams; no all-time great has ever done that. What made this dynamic between team and star work is that LeBron felt an important responsibility to see the Lakers through, and vice versa. \u201cOnce he put that trust in us, we had to deliver,\u201d Lakers president Rob Pelinka said. \u201cThere was no other option. We\u2019re grateful to put him in that position to get his fourth championship.\u201d Once again, on the highest stage, LeBron was a tornado. He averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, 8.5 assists and shot 58 percent in the series. He never had a poor game or showed any slippage or made a grave error. His consistency and high level was remarkable for someone at age 35 and in his 17th season. He also stayed sturdy, a testament to the body that refused to fail him despite all those years of tread wear. He previously won titles twice in Miami with a pair of stars, then hauled Cleveland to its first championship ever, then arrived in Los Angeles two summers ago bringing hope and heightened expectations that were a bit unrealistic initially. He didn\u2019t have Anthony Davis then, and after getting injured, he didn\u2019t have the playoffs, either. That slippage struck a nerve within LeBron, and also an untapped source of motivation that pushed him this far. \u201cIt fueled me because no matter what I\u2019ve done in my career, there was rumblings of doubt comparing me to the history of the game,\u201d he said. As for this latest championship, he and the Lakers did it under unusual circumstances, spending almost four months inside a security-sealed environment caused by a pandemic that delayed the season from March to July. But the journey never wavered \u2014 the Lakers lost only five games in the playoffs \u2014 and LeBron\u2019s resolve only magnified and solidified in this bubble. \u201cGoing into the unknown\u201d is how he described the Disney trip from start to finish, adding: \u201cOnce I got inside here, I said \u2018This is my mission. This is why I\u2019m here.\u2019 I wanted to keep my energy in the right place.\u201d He knew what was at stake, the task of restoring shine to the Lakers while pushing his own legend beyond yet another boundary. This was accomplished with a nightly display of leading by example and occasionally dropping triple-doubles and delivering defining plays in each round. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in LeBron James,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest basketball player the universe has ever seen. It\u2019s just been a remarkable experience coaching him. Seeing him take this group that was not in the playoffs last year, with a roster constructed overnight, and taking us to the promised land. I can\u2019t say enough about him.\u201d Vogel said that witnessing LeBron on game nights doesn\u2019t present the total picture or describe the star\u2019s true meaning to the team, that LeBron\u2019s impact is evident beneath the surface and behind the scenes. Vogel explained: \u201cWhen you think you know, you don\u2019t know.\u201d LeBron couldn\u2019t grab this championship, though, without Davis. The Lakers traded their future away last summer in the form of young players and draft picks, and sweetened the deal by tossing in the Hollywood sign and the Santa Monica pier to fetch a co-star. And no matter what happens from here, the Lakers came out ahead in that trade with New Orleans. It freed Davis. It saved LeBron. It restored the franchise. Davis at times this season was superior to LeBron. In the postseason and all the way until the final game, Davis was a heavy presence at both ends, hitting shots from all over the court and being a defensive intimidator at the opposite rim. Theirs was a partnership that bonded quickly mainly because their personalities and goals were aligned. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain it,\u201d James said. \u201cSome things you just know in any type of relationship, you have that feel, that vibe. You can\u2019t explain what links you to somebody and it\u2019s that organic. First thing I think about is the respect between us, no ego. We challenge each other. He wants me to be great, I want him to be great.\u201d The Lakers enjoyed a bountiful regular season, highlighted by back-to-back wins in early March over the Bucks and Clippers \u2014 a turning point, according to Vogel. LeBron was massive in those defining wins. Then the season came to an abrupt halt on March 11 when concerns over the coronavirus intensified. The layoff perhaps helped LeBron if only because it allowed him to delay the uptick in wear-and-tear that goes along with the playoffs. Also, those two contenders that the Lakers beat just before the season halted didn\u2019t show up on their postseason path at Disney. The Lakers were also nudged along by the memory and spirit of Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash in January along with his daughter, Gigi, and others. Pelinka said: \u201cKobe and Gianna have guided this team all year. For us to be able to win this championship doesn\u2019t take away from the sting of the loss. What it does is allow us to add to their legacy. This Lakers championship of 2020 is to build on that legacy and honor them. The moment couldn\u2019t be any more special.\u201d For the Buss family, this was yet another triumph. Following their previous title at the start of the decade, there was upheaval and a shift of power within the family ownership, with Jeanie assuming full control. She steered the organization from the rubble caused by failed trades and free agent signings, elevated Pelinka after an uncomfortable organizational fallout with Magic Johnson, and made the Lakers attractive enough for LeBron to sign as a free agent. \u201cGetting Jeanie back in this position is something that fueled me,\u201d said LeBron. \u201cI know how special it was for her. I\u2019m proud to be a Laker.\u201d Vogel was hired only after Ty Lue turned down the job. Vogel is a reputable defense-first coach who had the perfect anchor in Davis, and the coach also managed to get LeBron, who was lackluster on that side of the court last season, with the program. It was defense that swamped the Heat in Game 6, limiting Miami to just 36 first-half points and effectively snuffing any chance of a seventh game. \u201cOur guys saw the value very early on,\u201d said Vogel. \u201cThey brought in.\u201d There was supporting help from a few beyond-their-prime stars, mainly Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo. A role player, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, saved his finest moments as a Laker for The Finals when he hit big shots and kept rallies alive. But make no mistake, this was a LeBron production, pure and simple. Pelinka: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most genuine people I\u2019ve ever met. The amount of energy he spent keeping his teammates together and keeping them concentrated on a common goal was incredible.\u201d Vogel: \u201cTo have his mind and to use him as a resource and partner with him, to collaborate decisions on how to move forward with our group was fantastic. Every damn day in film he\u2019s leading the charge in getting our team better. I don\u2019t think people can undervalue that.\u201d And LeBron, trying to put championship No. 4 in perspective: \u201cThey\u2019re all special in their own right. One is not less than another. I can\u2019t say one is more difficult than the other. I can say I never won in this atmosphere. This was very challenging and difficult. It played with your mind, your body. You wouldn\u2019t be human if you didn\u2019t have ups and downs in the bubble. I\u2019ve never been without my family this long. Somehow I was able to keep the main thing the main thing. So this is right up there with one of the greatest accomplishments I have.\u201d When the confetti dropped, LeBron engaged his teammates in a group hug and dance, a snapshot of gratitude and relief that\u2019ll remain in this small gym forever. Maybe somewhere there will also be a towel left behind by Davis, who cried into it, his unibrow soaked. Those will serve as clues many years from now for historians searching for what happened Oct. 11 inside the Disney grounds. And then there\u2019ll be something they won\u2019t find: A single positive coronavirus test. Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

There will be no more coffee customers with the bubble closing down, though he kept it open far longer than expected with some of the most inspired NBA Finals play seen in years. Butler carried the Miami Heat all the way to Game 6 against the favored Los Angeles Lakers but the weight of his efforts seemed to leave him with little energy Sunday. He struggled to initiate the offense, was caught flat-footed on defense and was helpless along with his teammates to stop a Los Angeles onslaught in the second quarter. The Lakers capped off another championship with a 106-93 victory , a series that once seemed destined to be a sweep that Butler almost single-handedly extended two games longer than that. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve done it for the city, I wish I could\u2019ve done it for my teammates,\u201d Butler said. He became the first player with multiple triple-doubles of 35 or more points in an NBA Finals, and through five games was averaging 29.0 points, 10.2 assists, 8.6 rebounds and and 2.60 steals \u2014 statistics no player ever finished with in a finals. He wasn\u2019t close to those numbers Sunday, finishing with 12 points on only 10 shots. It was understandable after what Butler had to do just to get it this far. There was a 40-point triple-double to win Game 3 with the Heat down 2-0, then 35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, five steals and just 48 seconds of rest on Friday to help Miami put the Lakers\u2019 celebration on hold in Game 5. He leaned over a board in exhaustion late in that one, and fewer than 48 hours didn\u2019t appear to be enough time to recover. Rajon Rondo blew by him a couple times on drives to the basket early Sunday and Butler\u2019s bulldozing drives into the paint were lacking. \u201cI didn\u2019t win so none of the stats matter,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t play for stats here, we don\u2019t for anything else except for the win. I didn\u2019t [get] that, I didn\u2019t do my job and I\u2019ll be better.\u201d Still, everything he did on and off the court to get the fifth-seeded Heat from the middle of the pack to the top of the Eastern Conference is what will be remembered. \u201cHe is a winner, he is a leader, he is a motivator, a mentor and just a supreme competitor,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd when you get to this level I think so many people forget about that, the competition and what you can bring out of an entire franchise when you\u2019re wired to that level of fierce competitiveness.\u201d Butler had to carry the load for the Heat much of the finals after Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo were injured in Game 1. Adebayo missed the next two games and Dragic didn\u2019t return until Game 6. But Butler made no excuses, not only saying the Heat could win, but that they should win. With all he overcame to get this far, no wonder he thought he could also overcome the top-seeded Lakers. He didn\u2019t arrive in the NBA like LeBron James or Anthony Davis, No. 1 picks who were expected to head straight to stardom. Instead, he played a year of junior college basketball before being the last pick of the first round in 2011 by Chicago after coming out of Marquette. Butler went on to multiple All-Star selections and an Olympic gold medal, long ago proving himself as a player. In Miami and especially in the bubble, Butler proved himself as a teammate and a leader. That was in question in Minnesota, where he wanted out shortly after helping the Timberwolves end a 13-year playoff drought. The Wolves eventually dealt him to Philadelphia and Butler helped take the 76ers to a Game 7 in the second round last year, but they didn\u2019t bring him back. When looking at those teams now: Minnesota went back to its losing ways without Butler\u2019s talent and tenacity, and the 76ers bowed weakly out of the bubble in a first-round sweep. Those clubs might wish they didn\u2019t let Butler go. The Heat won\u2019t make the same mistake. They have him under contract for three more seasons and both sides say it\u2019s a perfect fit of player and organization, based on hard work, high effort and a passion for competition. Butler\u2019s coffee business provided a diversion during the three-month monotony of the bubble. He sold for $20 a cup to friends and foes, even trying to secure Lakers coach Frank Vogel as a customer earlier in the postseason. \u201cAs much as the offer was appealing to me, he still was a potential enemy, so I didn\u2019t want to go there,\u201d Vogel said. Denying Butler the salesman was easier for Vogel than clamping down on Butler the basketball player. The Lakers eventually did, but Butler said he promised Spoelstra and team President Pat Riley he would win the Heat a title, so he\u2019ll back. \u201cI didn\u2019t do my job so moving forward I\u2019ve got to hold up my end of the bargain,\u201d Butler said."},{"id":112597,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/finals-stat-lakers-heat-6","date":"2020-10-12","title":"The Finals Stat, Game 6: Lakers dominate at the rim","content":" In a season that included a 20-week hiatus and had players, coaches and staff living in a bubble for more than 90 days, the Los Angeles Lakers outlasted everybody else to win the 2020 NBA championship. The Lakers earned banner No. 17 with an easy 106-93 victory over the Miami Heat in Game 6 of The Finals on Sunday. The game was close for about 11 minutes. But the Heat never led and they trailed by as many as 36 points, struggling offensively until late in the third quarter. LeBron James capped his fourth championship and his fourth Finals MVP performance with his 28th career postseason triple-double , finishing with 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. Anthony Davis held down the Lakers\u2019 defense and Rajon Rondo came through with a big performance \u2014 19 points on 8-for-11 shooting \u2014 off the bench. One stat stood out from the rest as the Lakers closed out the longest season in NBA history. 25 \u2014 Restricted-area buckets for the Lakers in Game 6. The NBA has taken more 3-pointers every year for the last nine seasons. But the Lakers proved that you don\u2019t have to be a \u201cjump-shooting team\u201d to win in this league. In the regular season, L.A. ranked in the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage (21st) and the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range (23rd). In the playoffs, which began with a brutal shooting performance in Game 1 against the Portland Trail Blazers, they ranked 12th (35.4%) and 11th (40.8%). It didn\u2019t matter, because the Lakers had LeBron James and Anthony Davis, two of the league\u2019s most dominant players in the paint. James and Davis combined to shoot an incredible 220-for-287 (77%) in the restricted area in a postseason in which L.A. ranked first (by healthy margins) in both field goal percentage in the restricted area (69.9%) and the percentage of their shots that came in the restricted area (33.6%). The Lakers\u2019 25 buckets in the restricted area in Game 6 on Sunday were one fewer than their high for the playoffs. And they might have had more had the game not been a blowout. At the end of the third quarter, the score in the restricted area was Lakers 44, Heat 14. James led the way , scoring 20 of his 28 points at the basket. And Rondo was the surprise contributor, beating multiple Heat defenders off the dribble for five layups. Davis shot much better from the perimeter in the playoffs (effective field goal percentage of 52.3% from outside the paint) than he did in the regular season (41.7%), but the Lakers still made their bones inside. They shot worse from 3-point range than their opponent in 12 of their 21 playoff games, and they went 7-5 in those games. Other teams were 21-49 when shooting the lower percentage from beyond the arc. The Lakers\u2019 perimeter shooting was not a fatal flaw after all. Not only because of how well they scored inside, but also because of how well they defended. Game 6 was the Heat\u2019s worst offensive performance of the postseason . Davis had just eight points in the restricted area himself on Sunday, but he did most of his work on the other end of the floor. By the end of the game, the points in the paint were close (52-44), but there\u2019s a big difference between shots in the restricted area (64% shooting league-wide) and shots elsewhere in the paint (40%). While the Lakers had 35 of the former, the Heat had only 21 , with Davis playing exclusively at center and protecting the rim. Defense still wins championships. And, though the 3s are being launched more than ever, so do size and strength.

The Heat battled their way to this point without him, so they were obviously capable of capturing Game 6 without Dragic. But in the event that he was ready to play, ready to give them anything at all, that had to be a positive, right? Just having him active for Game 6 could have been enough to rattle the Lakers and perhaps inspire the Heat, who needed another four quarters of what they produced in their Game 5 win Friday night. Dragic stayed locked in on this series, doing whatever he could to try and get back in the mix. How much of an impact he could have on the game was anyone\u2019s guess. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra gave an optimistic assessment prior to Sunday\u2019s Game 6. \u201cHe\u2019s still been incredibly involved,\u201d he said of Dragic. \u201cYou just have to notice on the bench what kind of leader he is. He wants to be out there with his heart and soul, but his body will tell him whether he can do it or not. Either way, he\u2019s going to make an impact.\u201d Toss in Frank Vogel\u2019s starting lineup tweak (Alex Caruso in and Dwight Howard out), and there was more than enough drama riding on what could be the most intense game of this series, given all that was on the line. The Dragic news (it\u2019s news either way) swept through the grounds here before tipoff. But it would be foolish to bury the lead on what\u2019s going on here tonight: This was a legacy moment for one man above all others. *** 24 \u2014 Not sure what the Caruso play does for the Lakers. Dwight Howard\u2019s antics and ineffectiveness made it an easier decision for Vogel, I\u2019m sure. How it takes a toll on Anthony Davis, who will match up with Heat All-Star big man Bam Adebayo, is worthy of a close eye early on. I reserve the right to reconsider this later on tonight, but on the surface I don\u2019t like this idea. 23 \u2014 Duncan Robinson playing with some of that residual flame he had in Game 5. He\u2019s drained a couple of big 3-pointers already. But the real show-stopper of the first quarter is easily LeBron. He makes it look effortless at 35. 22 \u2014 This Heat team simply won\u2019t go away regardless of the circumstance. The Lakers have forced five early turnovers and you\u2019d think the Heat would be rattled. But no. They\u2019re down 17-6 with just over three minutes to play in the first quarter with their youngsters (Robinson, Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn) all making an impact. We don\u2019t talk about the job Spoelstra has done with these guys but it\u2019s truly an odd sight, seeing this from first- and second-year players. 21 \u2014 Dragic is in. Time to see if \u201cThe Dragon\u201d will swing the momentum the Heat\u2019s way \u2026 20 \u2014 This is going to be another part of this conversation tonight, for sure, depending on how Dragic fares \u2026 19 \u2014 Lakers on a good roll to end the first. They\u2019re playing with tons of energy and getting exactly what they need from LeBron and AD. 18 \u2014 LeBron putting together one of those nights right now with 11 points (5-for-6 from the floor), six rebounds and three assists. AD following his lead and Rajon Rondo with championship energy off the bench. Heat are in dangerous territory right now. Spoelstra needed a timeout to slow the Lakers down and let his guys regroup. 17 \u2014 LeBron is in freight train mode tonight, which is always my favorite mode to see him in. The fact that he can do this 17 years in should be noted and filed away for use later. 16 \u2014 There\u2019s a veteran point guard who changed the momentum tonight. It\u2019s just not Dragic \u2014 it\u2019s the Lakers\u2019 unsung hero this entire series. 15 \u2014 Lakers getting whatever they want on offense and smothering the Heat on the other end. This is championship effort from the men in the white jerseys. Bam looks particularly overwhelmed by the energy the Lakers are bringing. 51-32 with 4:01 to play before halftime. Just an absolute blitz by the Lakers right now. 14 \u2014 Tank looks to be on empty right now for Miami. Lakers up 64-36 at the half. Time to pack up the bubble? It\u2019s looking that way. 13 \u2014 It\u2019s definitely time to pack up! 12 \u2014 How quickly the narrative changes, from doomsday at the end of Game 5 to this at halftime of Game 6 \u2026 11 \u2014 Sitting here at halftime wondering what kind of verbiage we\u2019re going to get from LeBron after this one. Whole lot going on in 2020. You know he\u2019s going to have words for his doubters (real and imagined). 10 \u2014 This is a great point from an NBA OG: \u201dYou know you did this to yourself, right?\u201d 9 \u2014 Cold, but true. You learn from lessons like this in this league. 8 \u2014 The conversation shifts in this moment to what it means long-term for all involved, LeBron in particular. I respect Isiah\u2019s opinion more than most. We can agree to disagree on things. \u2026 and this has to register on the cool meter for the Hall of Famer, two-time champion and colleague: 7 \u2014 Classy stuff going on in L.A. as the Lakers put the finishing touches on this bubble experience and No. 17. You always hear about a city being a \u201c[INSERT TEAM HERE] Town.\u201d Not sure what folks in the Southland would say, but it\u2019ll be a Lakers Town into the wee hours of this night. 6 \u2014 What\u2019s gone on down here is nothing short of remarkable. From the planning, the buy-in from all sides to the execution and finish. Just remarkable to finish a season that seemed destined for something other than this on March 11, when the NBA stepped into the leadership void and did what had to be done. 5 \u2014 I\u2019m sure folks will spend the coming days and weeks debating the merits of his move, what it means to his legacy and all the other minutiae that follows his name in every conversation. But can we stop for one second and admit that no athlete in recent memory, and perhaps ever, has done what he\u2019s done? We\u2019re talking about a man 17 years into an already illustrious, all-time outlandish Hall of Fame career, taking his third organization to the title. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the G.O.A.T. or whatever you want to call it, but he\u2019s carved out a place for himself in that stratosphere where few others in the history of this or any organized, high-level competition have gone before. 4 \u2014 A thorough and dominant showing in a Game 6 that had to be won. Game 7 would have a totally different atmosphere, even in this bubble! 3 \u2014 Lakers celebrating outlasting the competition, 2020 (and the devastating loss of Kobe Bryant), COVID-19, a nation caught in the grips of social unrest and every other obstacle thrown their way in what goes down as the longest season in NBA history. Title No. 17 and LeBron James cementing his spot in Lakers\u2019 lore \u2026 2 \u2014 A decade between titles for the Lakers. Wonder how long it will be until their next one? And what about that Miami team? Was theirs just a bubble experience for them, a one-off, or the start of something else? 1 \u2014 Does the end justify the means for LeBron, AD, the Lakers, etc. I say yes. In a business where there is a finite amount of time to reach the top, to attain the highest level, it\u2019s hard to argue this finish. As LeBron said in the postgame celebration on the court here at AdventHealth Arena, they all just want their \u201cdamn respect.\u201d That fourth title and fourth Finals MVP is a great place to start for LeBron. https:\/\/twitter.com\/RealBillRussell\/status\/1315475682453983232 * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

(AP) \u2014 Another game, another record for LeBron James. Sunday\u2019s Game 6 of the NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat is the 260th of James\u2019 playoff career, lifting him into sole possession of first place on the league\u2019s postseason appearances list. James is in his 17th season. After missing the playoffs in his first two seasons, he has reached the postseason 14 times in 15 years. His teams in Cleveland, Miami and now Los Angeles have gone 14-0 in first-round series with James on the roster, 11-3 in second-round series and 10-1 in the conference-final round. He had been tied with Derek Fisher for the top spot on the playoff list with 259. To put James\u2019 postseason longevity into perspective, consider that 260 games is the equivalent of 3.2 full regular seasons. And out of the 4,489 players to have appeared in an NBA regular-season contest, 63% did not (or in the case of active players, have not) gotten into 260 games. That means James\u2019 postseason career alone has included more games than most NBA players\u2019 entire careers. Game 6 of The Finals is also the 55th NBA Finals game of James\u2019 career, tying him with Jerry West for fourth-most in league history.

After their 111-108 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 of The Finals on Friday, the Heat are 11-3 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes in these playoffs. Over the 24 years for which we have play-by-play data, only one team \u2014 the 2001-02 Lakers at 13-3 \u2014 has had more *playoff wins that were within five in the last five. Only four teams have a had a better winning percentage in at least 10 clutch playoff games. * Over those 24 years, three of the five teams with at least 10 clutch postseason wins have been versions of the Heat; the 2005-06 champs and the 2010-11 finalists were both 10-4. The fourth quarter of Game 5 featured LeBron James on one end of the floor, Jimmy Butler on the other, and some key wrinkles in both offenses. 1. Lakers with an empty corner  The Lakers\u2019 fourth-quarter offense included several pick-and-rolls from the left side of the floor with an empty left corner. That forced the Heat to either leave somebody open or bring help from the weak side. Midway through the fourth, James was the screen-setter and got a clean roll to the rim with no Heat defender in position to help. A few possessions later, Danny Green set the same screen for James, flaring to the empty corner, with Tyler Herro defending the screen with a hard show and recover technique. Green\u2019s flare got Jae Crowder to slide over from the weak side of the floor so that he could close out to Green in the left corner. With Bam Adebayo on the baseline checking Anthony Davis, James threw a dart to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who had just enough time and space to shoot from the right corner. The Lakers ran a very similar action (Davis set an additional ball screen) with Caldwell-Pope and Green in opposite roles on the very next possession. Herro was able to close out to Green and force a step-back 3 that missed . Later in the fourth, the Lakers ran two straight empty-corner pick-and-rolls with James as the ball-handler. On the first, Adebayo was drawn to the flare from the weak side, allowing Markieff Morris to crash for an offensive rebound (on which he was fouled). On the second, Adebayo left Davis to close out on Caldwell-Pope, but Herro was able to box out the Lakers big man. 2. The pre-switch  With a little less than four minutes left, Green was ready to set another ball screen for James. But rather than have Duncan Robinson defend it, Adebayo switched onto Green before the screen was set. So Green aborted the play and Markieff Morris (now being defended by Robinson) set the screen instead. That affected the Lakers\u2019 spacing and allowed two Miami defenders (Adebayo and Herro) to defend three Lakers on the weak side. Robinson recovered to Morris and James was left to play one-on-one against Butler, who got some help from Herro and blocked James at the basket . 3. Switch and iso  James playing one-on-one wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad option. With a little less than two minutes to go, Davis set the screen for James with an empty left corner. While Herro and Robinson have gone with the hard show and recover technique, Crowder just switched the screen. Davis cleared out, allowing James to isolate against Crowder. He got to the rim for a rather ridiculous and-one . With the Lakers down one in the final minute, Alex Caruso set a ball screen in the middle of the floor for James, who waited out Robinson and attacked Butler one-on-one. His drive collapsed the defense, and the Heat\u2019s rotations allowed Davis to get in position to rebound Caldwell-Pope\u2019s missed 3 and put the Lakers back ahead . 4. Flat screen frees Butler from Davis  Davis\u2019 defense on Butler was critical to the Lakers\u2019 win in Game 4. On Friday, Miami had some success by setting screens at different angles. With the screener\u2019s back parallel to the baseline, it was harder for Davis to get under the screen and meet Butler on the other side. On the Heat\u2019s last possession of the third quarter, Crowder set such a flat screen to dislodge Davis and, with Kyle Kuzma out of position, Butler got into the paint, drew help, and dropped the ball off to Adebayo for a dunk. The possession that got Butler to the line for the game-clinching free throws was similar. Crowder got James off of Butler with the same flat screen and Morris was similarly out of position, giving Butler a wide-open lane to the basket, where he was met with a foul from Davis. 5. The possession in question  The Lakers, of course, still had one more chance. Not surprisingly, James had the ball and Robinson was put into the action, with Green setting up for a screen to get James toward the middle of the floor. The Heat didn\u2019t defend it well. Butler \u201ciced\u201d the screen (keeping James on the side), but Robinson wasn\u2019t in position to get in front of James when he went the other way. James\u2019 drive drew four defenders and Green was left wide open at the top of the arc. The pass wasn\u2019t to James\u2019 standards. Green had to knock it down before gathering the ball and rising for his shot. One thing to note is where James took off from\u2026 He didn\u2019t really have his feet under him as he left the ground, making that pass just a little bit tougher, which made Green\u2019s shot not quite in-rhythm. More Jimmy. More LeBron. What\u2019s left in the tank?  We can certainly expect the ball to be in the hands of Butler and James again for most of Game 6 on Sunday (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC). And if Davis is at all hobbled by his heel contusion, we could see even more of the Lakers\u2019 guards setting screens, a game plan which has generally worked out well for the Lakers. Of course, both players are coming off ridiculous efforts. Butler has averaged 45.1 minutes and 10.6 minutes of possession (while being the primary defender on James) over the last four games. James has gotten more rest and hasn\u2019t had the ball quite as much, but he might not be able to shoot 6-for-9 from 3-point range again. Keep an eye on the empty corners and screen angles. If it\u2019s another game that goes down to the wire, the little things will mean a lot. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

If they weren\u2019t paying attention, the Los Angeles Lakers surely now understand the power of the Miami Heat\u2019s cohesion and depth. \u201cThis didn\u2019t just start in the bubble,\u201d Butler said after leading Miami\u2019s 111-108 win over the Lakers in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. \u201cWe have been playing together \u2014 win, loss, draw, whatever \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to win us games. \u201cNight in and night out, it could be anybody [stepping up to win games]. It could be Bam [Adebayo], it could be hopefully Goran [Dragic]. We\u2019re so together when we\u2019re out there on the floor, off the floor. That\u2019s why we win, because everybody wants everybody to be successful.\u201d > Game 6: Lakers vs. Heat, ABC (Sunday, 7:30 ET) Butler averaged 44 minutes in Games 2-4, then played all but 48 seconds Friday en route to a 35-point triple-double that helped the Heat stay alive for at least one more game. Miami knows it needs even more from Butler to harbor realistic hopes of overcoming a 3-1 deficit to win the series. But it also expects heavier contributions in Game 6 on both sides of the floor from supporting cast players such as Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro. Robinson ratcheted up the aggression offensively in Game 5 to wallop the Lakers for 26 points and seven 3-pointers, while Nunn, a rookie, contributed 14 points on 6-of-11 shooting. Herro added 12 points, and his accuracy as a shooter demands he\u2019s always accounted for by the defense. So, with Adebayo missing two games earlier this series due to a strained neck, and Dragic (torn left plantar fascia) remaining doubtful for Game 6 after his injury in the series opener, Miami understands how much it stands to benefit from someone else picking up their production to complement Butler\u2019s output. \u201cAbsolutely, it was going to require more from everybody,\u201d Robinson explained. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we talked about.\u201d It should continue moving forward for the Heat. But the Lakers need to conduct their own talks about fully recognizing the importance of fighting to neutralize much more than just Butler. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to throw at me on any given night, but I think whatever you throw at me it\u2019s not going to work because if I\u2019m open, I\u2019m going to shoot it,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not, I\u2019m going to pass it to Duncan or Tyler or K-Nunn or Bam or Jae [Crowder] and they\u2019re going to make the shot.\u201d In Game 4, Los Angeles threw LeBron James and Anthony Davis at Butler constantly, and the veteran swingman still managed to score 22 points to go with 10 rebounds and nine assists. Herro, Robinson, Nunn and Adebayo combined for 59 points, but the Lakers held on to win 102-96. That same group accounted for 65 points in Game 5. As Miami prepped for that contest, Butler implored Robinson \u201cto stop running from the basketball.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t shoot the ball if you don\u2019t have the ball,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s coming to the ball when he\u2019s open, when he\u2019s not open, that\u2019s the Duncan Robinson that we need, that we want, because that\u2019s how he\u2019s been playing all year long. And we\u2019re going to need him to be even more aggressive for Game 6.\u201d It\u2019s likely Los Angeles anticipates as much from Robinson, especially. But the rest of Miami\u2019s supporting cast appears to have gained confidence as this series has progressed. The Lakers haven\u2019t been able to consistently contain Butler as a scorer or facilitator. So, Los Angeles\u2019 focus could easily shift towards the beneficiaries of Butler\u2019s passes. \u201cDuncan Robinson came up too many times wide open,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTwo four-point plays, offensive rebounds, stuff that we can control.\u201d Davis wants to use Los Angeles\u2019 late-game heartbreak from Game 5 as \u201cfuel\u201d for Sunday\u2019s clash, but insisted the Lakers aren\u2019t feeling pressure after losing for the first time this season in their Kobe Bryant-designed \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d uniforms. The Lakers need only one win to capture the title. Miami needs two. \u201cYou come back, you look at the film, fix your mistakes, then come out in Game 6 remembering how close we were,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make our mistakes, we win the game. It\u2019s a tough one because we know we had this one in the bag.\u201d Miami listened to all the talk going into Game 5 that pointed toward a pending Lakers coronation. Said Herro, \u201cEverybody counted us out since the beginning of the playoffs.\u201d So this current situation isn\u2019t uncharted territory for the Heat. Coming off Friday\u2019s victory, having built some momentum for Game 6, they\u2019ll hit the court on Sunday and see the confetti machines stationed somewhere near the court, and they\u2019ll smile the way Butler does every time his team\u2019s back is against the wall facing elimination.  Miami coach Erik Spoelstra expects nothing less from a team that revels in adversity. \u201cWe are here competing for a title, and that\u2019s the most important storyline, and it\u2019s going to take everything we have,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is everything that our guys in our locker room wanted. It\u2019s this kind of competition between four lines, two baskets. You can\u2019t write or print out the winner on this one. \u201cThis one has to be earned between those four lines, and that\u2019s where our guys thrive.\u201d * * * Michael C.

And I\u2019m going to try to change those thousand before we start this coming year.\u201d If Williams were to rank those thousand reasons, there\u2019s no doubt what No. 1 would be: When Cole Anthony, the top-rated point guard in the class of 2019, went down with a knee injury 11 games into the season, the Tar Heels were in trouble. Anthony, announcing his presence by blasting Notre Dame with 34 points and six 3-point goals in his college debut, led North Carolina to a 6-1 record in its five seven games, including wins over the Fighting Irish, Alabama, and Oregon. Those latter two victories came in the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas, where Anthony began to experience pain in his right knee. \u201cI told our trainer my knee felt weird,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cShe asked me to walk to the training room; it was probably a 20-minute walk to get there. And I told her I didn\u2019t think I could make it.\u201d Despite the pain, Anthony played against the Ducks, managed to endure 28 minutes and scored 19 points. What happened next was a shocker. The Heels lost at home to Ohio State, 74-49, then could muster only 47 points in a loss at Virginia. Anthony played in both, but it was obvious something was seriously wrong. \u201cAt the shootaround at Virginia, I couldn\u2019t jog,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cI was limping around, just struggling to move.\u201d With that, Anthony was drydocked. No one, least of all Anthony, is exactly sure when he suffered a small meniscus tear, but after undergoing surgery, he had every reason, given his future NBA career, to bid farewell to college basketball. There was even recent precedent \u2014 the season before, when Vanderbilt point guard Darius Garland suffered the same injury after just five games, he opted for a different surgical procedure with a longer recovery timeline, ultimately deciding to call it quits. His college career lasted all of 139 minutes. Anthony could have chosen that route, but the son of former UNLV star and NBA player Greg Anthony had come to North Carolina to play ball. He wasn\u2019t about to let a knee injury derail him. The Tar Heels were 4-7 without Anthony in the lineup, and by the time he returned, they were destined to establish a low watermark in Williams\u2019 long career. Anthony has no regrets. \u201cA few things went into my decision to keep playing,\u201d Anthony says. But first and foremost, I love the sport of basketball. A lot of people say that, but they don\u2019t really mean it. I truly love the game. And I wasn\u2019t going to sit out when I was healthy, and I could go.\u201d NBA Draft decision makers throughout the league can gather a great deal from that comment. As elementary as it sounds, loving basketball is the most import prerequisite for success. In order to be great, the amount of time required to hone the necessary skills is considerable. Not everyone is wired to work that hard. Anthony also showed toughness \u2014 mental and physical, by getting back on the floor. And finally, he showed loyalty. \u201cI had made a commitment to North Carolina,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cI\u2019m big on whenever I make a commitment, sticking to that commitment, following it through. I felt like I owed that to all my coaches and teammates. I didn\u2019t go to college to play just nine games. Especially seeing how the team was struggling. We still struggled [after Anthony returned], but I wanted to be a part of it.\u201d Despite the time he spent on the sidelines, Anthony still led UNC in scoring \u2014 with the second-highest average for a freshman (18.5 ppg) in program history \u2014 and in assists (4.0 apg). He earned a spot on the ACC All-Freshman team and was also chosen third-team All-ACC. \u201cCole had the numbers and wound up having a pretty impressive year,\u201d UNC assistant coach Brad Frederick says. \u201cBut what was really impressive to us about Cole was that he came back. A million kids in his situation would have shut it down and concentrated on the Draft. But Cole was 100 percent focused on coming back, despite us obviously having a down year.\u201d The North Carolina coaches didn\u2019t get to see nearly as much of Anthony as they had hoped when they signed him, but Frederick can quickly point to some next-level skills that were on display. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d say he played the perfect year, but at the same time, all the obstacles he was up against have to be taken into account,\u201d Frederick says. \u201cHis shooting numbers would have been a little bit better had he not been forced into so many bad shots. A lot of times it was \u2018give the ball to Cole and see if he can bail us out.\u2019 He\u2019s a better shooter than his numbers indicate. \u201cHe\u2019s also a really good passer. He can get in the lane and finish. He\u2019s so athletic. Driving in and finishing through contact and dunking on guys is not something that\u2019s a problem for him. Defensively, he is probably the best defensive rebounding guard I\u2019ve ever been around. He\u2019s got an unbelievable ability to rebound for a point guard. Where he needs to get better is on the ball and off the ball in terms of being more locked in. He has the tools for being a good defender.\u201d Anthony has spent the pandemic working out, \u201cgetting up in the morning, and doing what has to be done,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was tough [with no timetable for the Draft], but it was rewarding, and I feel like I\u2019ve gotten better every day.\u201d Anthony looks back with a mix of fondness and regret on his time at North Carolina, but now he\u2019s locked on the future. He thinks his skillset will blend in perfectly with the modern NBA. \u201cI see myself as the definition of a true one, which has been changing [over the years],\u201d Anthony says. \u201cThe best point guards can all score the basketball. You look at Chris Paul, the truest point guard in the league. Give him 20 points a game. He can score that basketball. I see myself as being able to score, but at the same time get my teammates the ball, hit the open man, and make the right basketball play.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

For Kerr, no journey through broadcasting, general managing and coaching, no five straight Finals trips and three titles with Golden State? For Paxson, no longtime job, secure through ups and downs, running the Chicago Bulls? Both those guys made clutch shots after the NBA\u2019s reigning superstar gave up the ball in critical waning minutes of Finals clinchers, Paxson in 1993 vs. Phoenix and Kerr in 1997 vs. Utah. They became household names for their clutch ability and part of Michael Jordan\u2019s legacy (in the learning-to-trust-teammates category). > Finals Game 6: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday, 7:30 p.m. ET on ABC Danny Green, however, missed his shot Friday night. Green, with two rings to his credit already (San Antonio in 2014, Toronto in 2019), had the chance at a third right in his hands. LeBron James\u2019 pass \u2014 the correct play with three Miami defenders collapsing on James deep along the right side \u2014 found Green open out front just behind the 3-point line. He launched with 7.1 seconds left and his team down 109-108, on the brink of entering Lakers lore, only to have the ball kick off the rim. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra didn\u2019t want James, who is entirely capable, making some ridiculous, heart-wrenching baseline prayer to win it. He also knows James and his instincts to do the right thing in those moments. No way a guy with one eye on Jordan most of his career is going to pass up any opportunities to check that box, too. Green is said to be bothered by an aching hip. That might explain why he\u2019s been ordinary from the arc in these playoffs (33.3%) and worse in the Finals (25.8%, 8 of 31). But he got called out on it anyway, notably on Instagram by L.A. fan Snoop Dogg. Others took to social media to question James\u2019 decision to put the ball in Green\u2019s hands. https:\/\/twitter.com\/CJMcCollum\/status\/1314783292336476160%20 https:\/\/twitter.com\/CJMcCollum\/status\/1314783292336476160%20 Someone even dredged up in the postgame media session James\u2019 pass to an open Donyell Marshall late in Game 1 of the 2007 Eastern Conference finals against Detroit. Marshall\u2019s shot missed, too (though the greater question might be, how old is James really? Donyell Marshall as a teammate?) It was wasted inquiry. James made the right play. The Lakers and Green just got the wrong result. \u201cWe got a hell of a look to win the game, to win the series,\u201d James said. \u201cDidn\u2019t go down. And then we got the offensive rebound, we turned the ball over.\u201d Why yes, let\u2019s not forget that Markieff Morris proved he\u2019s no Chris Bosh when it comes to claiming a late-game rebound and making the right decision. The Lakers\u2019 backup forward had time and legit options \u2014 over to LeBron on the right wing, turning around and handing the ball to Green for a reset \u2014 when he chose to float a goofy pass toward the basket. It went over Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo to some place where Davis wasn\u2019t going to be. https:\/\/twitter.com\/KevinOConnorNBA\/status\/1314828740090908672\/photo\/2 https:\/\/twitter.com\/KevinOConnorNBA\/status\/1314828740090908672\/photo\/2 From the other side, Miami\u2019s Jae Crowder shot 4-of-13, including 2-of-9 on 3s. A couple more makes and Green\u2019s miss never would have mattered or happened. As it is, the veteran guard has one, maybe two, more games to alter the trajectory of the rest of his life! OK, well, Green still can make people forget the miss over time , as long as the Lakers prevail. The way James and Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler went at it in Game 5 overall but particularly down the stretch, with its seven lead changes in the final three-plus minutes, was reminiscent of some old-school NBA. Like Larry Bird vs. Dominique Wilkins back in the \u201880s. At one point as they and their teams traded haymakers, ABC\u2019s Mark Jackson pulled out the prizefight imagery, likening the action to a back-and-forth Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier brawl. Butler finished with 35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists and five steals. He is averaging 29 points, 8.6 board, 10.2 assists and 2.6 steals, while shooting 56% from the field. James? Pretty much the same: 30.2 points, 11.4 rebounds, 8.2 assists and 58% shooting. What we were treated to Friday was a glimpse of a like-minded assassin James might have found in Kobe Bryant if their careers had been more in sync. Alas, timing prevented what the NBA surely would have loved, to pit those two legendary Jordan chasers against each other two, three or more times in The Finals. It didn\u2019t even happen once. James wasn\u2019t in the league yet when Bryant went to and won his first three Finals. He had wrapped up his rookie season when the Lakers went again in 2004. James got here for the first time in 2007, then Bryant led the Lakers to the next three. And that was it for him, as James began his stretch of eight consecutive trips. The foes James and his teams did face were mostly excellent \u2014 the Spurs, Mavs, Thunder, Spurs, Spurs, Warriors, Warriors, Warrior and Warriors \u2014 but didn\u2019t quite match up the way he and this version of Butler have. San Antonio\u2019s core of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili didn\u2019t engage directly with James. Dirk Nowitzki played a different position. Kevin Durant was a relative pup, sharing OKC\u2019s load with Russell Westbrook. The Warriors had numbers to throw at James, with that version of Durant a little better matched. But James\u2019 Miami and Cleveland Finals were more about the Big Three he gathered around him. And this postseason, James has had more help from Anthony Davis than Hasselhoff got from K.I.T.T. That changed due to Davis\u2019 sore right heel Friday, which had the Lakers\u2019 big man leaving space down the stretch for some vintage, weight-bearing LeBron. Butler was there to meet him, eye to eye for a night, for a little what-might-have-been. Jordan never had that foil on equal footing that helps define many careers. Bryant largely did not, either, beyond some snarling with Paul Pierce. It\u2019s like Tiger Woods or Serena Williams, making a little less sound when only one hand is clapping. No one is suggesting that Butler is on James\u2019 level, yet or ever. But there were two hands clapping hard in this one. Duncan Robinson had been kept in check for the first four games, shooting 8-of-26 on 3-pointers and averaging 9.8 points. But the Miami sniper got free often enough Friday to score 26 points while making seven of his 13 shots from deep. Unassuming in appearance, Robinson demonstrated the game-changing range and release that makes him valuable as a decoy even on nights defenders stick close. That\u2019s what the Lakers figure to do after film study for Sunday (ABC, 7:30 p.m. ET) , without exception if they can manage it. It might not thwart Butler\u2019s attacks and mid-range effectiveness, but it could choke off a primary outlet for the Miami All-Star\u2019s draw-and-kicks. Robinson reached elite status in Game 5 \u2014 only Steph Curry and Ray Allen have ever made more than seven 3-pointers in a Finals game. A more obscure achievement? His were the most ever by an undrafted player, swiping Gary Neal\u2019s claim to fame from his big Game 3 in the 2013 Finals for San Antonio. Neal went 6-of-10 from the arc, scoring 24 points against James\u2019 Miami squad that night. Granted, Neal shot 5-of-18 from the arc in Games 5, 6 and 7 of that series, which the Spurs lost (you may recall Allen\u2019s corner 3 in Game 6). It earned him a two-year contract in free agency from Milwaukee worth $6.5 million. He and his opportunities for dramatics were done; Neal played in just four more postseason games and washed swiftly through Milwaukee, Charlotte, Washington and Atlanta on his way out of the league in 2017. Robinson\u2019s future is looking a little more stable in south Florida. Davis was optimistic late Friday, vowing that his sore heel won\u2019t stop him from participating and thriving in Game 5. He visibly was hobbled down the stretch Friday, though he finished with 28 points and 12 boards and had a critical put-back that had L.A. in front briefly, 108-107. The more lingering image, however, was Davis testing his foot, then going down beyond the baseline while grabbing and wincing. As the game ground to a halt, there was a shot of James walking toward his bench, raising his eyebrows. This wasn\u2019t the first time he and the other Lakers have had to hold their breaths, anticipating something worse. One of these times, they might get it. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior, man,\u201d James said. \u201cBeing out there hobbled, it brings a lot more confidence to myself and our team. We know the nicks, bumps and bruises he\u2019s played through throughout the whole season.\u201d More like his whole career. Five times in Davis\u2019 eight NBA seasons, he missed between 14 and 26 games. Meanwhile, his false alarms have numbered in the dozens, as defined by on-court grimacing and in-game trips back to the trainer\u2019s room. He played in 62 of the Lakers\u2019 71 regular-season games in 2019-20. But there\u2019s always the prospect of an ankle here or a heel there that might cost him a handful of games at the worst possible time. Something that could sideline him for only one or two now could be disastrous for him and the others. There were confetti machines in place late in Game 5, poised for a Lakers victory. It brought to mind not just the yellow rope laid out prematurely in Miami in 2013, anticipating a Spurs title there, but also the balloons old-time Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had suspended in the Forum rafters for Game 7 of the 1969 Finals. That party-prep was seen by Lakers HOF guard Jerry West, a notorious fretter, as hubris, and Bill Russell and the Celtics saw it the same way. They made those balloons unnecessary when Don Nelson\u2019s jump shot bounced high off the back of the rim, then dropped through to clinch Boston\u2019s victory. That remains one of the great championship climaxes in NBA history. What played out at AdventHealth Arena Friday would have qualified too, if only it had decided the series. But there\u2019s no telling how exciting or not Game 6 and a possible Game 7 might be. A classic nail-biter would be the best possible way for this bubble finally to burst. The talent and stakes are there for it, though the basketball gods remain in charge. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

CCTV aired Game 5 of The NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat \u2014 the first time the league appeared on the network since the rift that started when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for anti-government protesters in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Eighteen-year-old high school student Li Xinyu said he considered the timing meaningful following the death of Lakers great Kobe Bryant earlier this year and his former team\u2019s subsequent playoff run. \u201cYes, I am really surprised,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt is really shocking and significant for us that we can watch the NBA final again on CCTV\u2019s sports channel.\u201d Yang Haoyu, also 18, said basketball was bigger than anything one person had said or done. \u201cThe NBA is an organization for all basketball fans and individual behaviors should not have big impact(s) on the sport and make the majority of the fans to suffer,\u201d Yang said. And like most fans, 22-year-old migrant worker Deng Jinqi was just tired of watches games on his phone. \u201cNow we can watch the game on a large TV screen and you can even lie on the sofa comfortably to enjoy,\u201d he said. CCTV quickly halted its relationship with the NBA after Morey\u2019s tweet, even though the post was quickly deleted. China\u2019s Communist leaders are extremely sensitive to anything they view as outside interference in domestic political affairs, including in Hong Kong, a former British colony where protests broke out last year over deteriorating civil liberties. NBA games have been available to Chinese fans on the streaming service Tencent, another of the league\u2019s broadcast partners.

Imagine the gall, the audacity, the sheer guts it must\u2019ve taken to chill, even for a moment, while a compelling contest swirled all around him. Well, sure, OK then. He did deserve that. He did need to allow his burning lungs to expand and contract safely after he got fouled deep in the fourth quarter and then sauntered over and leaned on the railing surrounding the court for support. Because his coach, Erik Spoelstra, didn\u2019t have enough compassion to give him much rest on this night \u2014 or Spoelstra knew the Heat couldn\u2019t afford to allow it. Because this Game 5, a do-or-die for Miami\u2019s season, required whatever Butler could give, and then some. Because, even at that delicate and quick moment of peace, his classic duel with LeBron James and the outcome of the game begged for more. > Finals Game 6: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday at 7:30 ET on ABC And so Butler did catch his breath with 16.8 seconds left before going to the free throw line and swishing two more and then proceeding to burn the candle on the other end, as he did time and time again Friday to enhance his basketball reputation and his team\u2019s chances of making this series better than anyone could\u2019ve imagined. \u201cI left it all out there on the court,\u201d he said. The Finals will go a sixth game because Butler played all but 48 seconds out of a possible 48 minutes and won his fourth-quarter stare-down with LeBron. Did you see this coming? Did you figure that Butler, a nice enough player who never reached MVP contention in his career, would get the best of an opponent who\u2019s on the Mount Rushmore of greats? Did you really see the Heat, after watching their 11-point lead evaporate Friday, fighting back by taking their cue from Butler to keep the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy stashed in a back room at the Disney campus for another day? They\u2019ve won a pair of games in this series against the heavily-favored Lakers because Butler was epic twice now. He followed up a 40-point triple-double in Game 3 with a 35-point triple in Game 5. He got the best of LeBron on a night when LeBron sizzled and was locked into closeout mode. \u201cHis will to win is remarkable,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cTo do that in 47-plus minutes and take the challenge on the other end \u2026 every young player coming into this league should study footage of Jimmy Butler, a definition of a two-way player competing on both ends. Remarkable, exceptional.\u201d It\u2019s now 3-2 Lakers after the 111-108 loss, and while the series still leans in the direction of the Lakers, with each game there\u2019s always a chance of something going wrong \u2014 like, an untimely injury that could spell doom. Speaking of that, Anthony Davis spent the fourth quarter on one leg, caused by an apparent foot injury in the first quarter, and he has only one day to heal up before Sunday\u2019s tipoff. But that\u2019s a conversation for later. Right now, this is about Butler and LeBron and their ridiculous stat lines, which don\u2019t fully explain how their back-and-forth buckets made for must-see basketball in the tense closing moments. And craziest of all, that brilliance was capped by Danny Green missing a potentially championship-winning 3-pointer with seven seconds left. This was Butler: 35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, five steals. He scored nine of the Heat\u2019s last 11 points. He feasted on mid-range shots and layups, further damaging his reputation among the analytics crowd. He was 12-for-12 from the free throw line. He took command in most of the crucial moments and possessions, saving a few for the undrafted Duncan Robinson, who blistered from deep by making 7-of-13. And he took the task of guarding LeBron, burning calories on the other end of the court as well. \u201cI want him to be great,\u201d said teammate Bam Adebayo. \u201cI want him to be something special, and he keeps doing it.\u201d This was LeBron: 40 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, three steals. He shot 6-for-9 on 3-pointers. He also charged the rim, especially late in the game, dropping layups and sometimes drawing fouls. LeBron also made the right basketball play on the Lakers\u2019 final possession when he threw to an open Green rather than compete against a Miami double team with the Lakers down a point in the final 20 seconds. It was indeed the right play, one that was made twice by Michael Jordan to win championships. That said, Green hasn\u2019t been right from the 3-point line throughout much of the playoffs \u2014 or much of the season, actually. His miss wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. Many others who found themselves in those moment in previous NBA Finals \u2014 Robert Horry, Steve Kerr, Ray Allen, John Paxson, Kyrie Irving \u2014 flourished, not floundered. \u201cI was able to draw two defenders from below the free throw line and find one of our shooters for a wide-open 3 to win the championship,\u201d LeBron explained. \u201cI trusted him. I know he wished he could have it again. I wish I could\u2019ve made a better pass. You live with it.\u201d Making matters worse for the Lakers on that possession was Markieff Morris mindlessly throwing the rebound away; he just suffered brain-lock. It delayed a Lakers coronation and kept the Disney campus populated for at least two more days and gave the Heat a sense of confidence in a series that nonetheless requires them to keep climbing mountains. Butler was still talking up his teammates well into the night, saying how he liked their chances even if the world doesn\u2019t: \u201cWe built for this. We been doing this all year long. This didn\u2019t start in the bubble. We\u2019re so together on the floor, off the floor, that\u2019s why we win. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to play from here on out \u2026 We ain\u2019t backing down, we ain\u2019t shying away. We still fight. We\u2019re not scared of nobody. We\u2019re in it to win it.\u201d Actually, a large part why the Heat have won two games is Butler, and despite the Lakers defense now paying him all sorts of respect, he has something to say about that, too: \u201cNo matter how they\u2019re going to guard me I\u2019m going to make the right play \u2026 That\u2019s what my team asks of me. That\u2019s what they need me to do. I know that I\u2019m capable of it, but I have a great group of guys who make it a hell of a lot easier. They give me a lot of confidence to go out there and hoop. \u201cIt\u2019s easy whenever I have a group of guys around me and a coach who thinks I can play at a high level. I got so many people in my ear to tell me to keep doing what I\u2019m doing. \u201cI know I\u2019m capable of it. I believe in my skill set and talent.\u201d The next game of the NBA season was supposed to take place in January or February or whenever science decided to allow the league to write a specific target date for 2021 in ink. Instead, the 2020 season and the 2020 NBA Finals will get at least one more game, in a few days. In a best-case scenario for Miami, there will be more from Jimmy Butler both in terms of minutes and poise. And plenty from Robinson, who has the green light even with defenders hanging on him; as Spoelstra said, \u201c[Duncan] and Tyler are sticks of dynamite, they can go off at any time.\u201d And maybe the determination and hustle from the Heat can make the Lakers flinch. For the Lakers, it\u2019s all about Davis and his ankle and if a third impact player will surface. And maybe next time, Danny Green makes the shot, assuming LeBron still has confidence in him.

James quickly launched a pass backward to a wide-open Green standing at the top of the 3-point line. \u201cI mean, if you just look at the play, I was able to draw two defenders below the free-throw line and find one of our shooters at the top of the key for a wide-open 3 to win a championship,\u201d James said. \u201cI trusted him, we trusted him, and it just didn\u2019t go.

Morris could\u2019ve thrown the ball back to Green, who was unguarded after missing the shot. But Morris floated a pass over the head of Anthony Davis posted up under the basket, and the ball flew out of bounds to give Miami possession with 2.2 seconds remaining. \u201cThis one, it was a little bit of luck that Danny Green missed that shot at the key,\u201d said Butler, who scored a team-high 35 points for the Heat.

The Heat survived one of the best games of the 2020 playoffs, escaping with a thrilling 111-108 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 of The Finals on Friday. Jimmy Butler played all by 49 seconds of the game and put together with his second triple-double of the last three games, finishing with 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, adding five steals. It was a one-possession game for the final 6:51 and Butler put his team ahead four different times in the last two minutes. The Lakers got 40 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists from LeBron James. But Anthony Davis was hobbled by a heel contusion and when James drew four defenders on his final drive, Danny Green missed a wide-open 3 for the lead with seven seconds on the clock. One stat stood out from the rest as the Heat forced a Game 6 (Sunday, 7:30 p.m. ET, ABC). 19, 12 \u2014 Jimmy Butler\u2019s field goal attempts and free throw attempts in Game 5. Butler would be a more efficient scorer if he could shoot 3s like Stephen Curry or even Jayson Tatum. His effective field goal percentage of 34.3% on shots from outside the paint was the worst mark among 190 players who attempted at least 200 shots from the outside in the regular season. His jumper has been better in the playoffs (effective field goal percentage of 46.0% from outside the paint), but he\u2019s still attempted just five shots per game from the outside. > Finals Game 6: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday at 7:30 ET on ABC But 99% of the league would be more efficient if it could get to the line like Butler. In the regular season, he attempted 69.3 free throws per 100 shots from the field, the *second highest rate among 155 players with at least 500 field goal attempts. The Heat led the league in free throw rate (29.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field) as a team. * Only Rudy Gobert (72.4 per 100) had a higher rate. Yes, Butler\u2019s free throw rate was higher than that of James Harden (52.8 attempts per 100 shots from the field). In the playoffs, Butler\u2019s free throw rate is down slightly (66.0 per 100), but he now has three games of 12 or more attempts in The Finals. On Friday, he became the 32nd player with at least 50 free throw attempts in a Finals series. (James has attempted 50-plus free throws in just one of his 10 trips to the Finals.) Of course, there\u2019s more to it than just getting to the line. Butler made all 12 of his free throws on Friday and is now 46-for-50 (92%) in the series. Nobody had shot 90% or better on at least 50 free throw attempts in The Finals until last season, when both Kawhi Leonard (58-for-64) and Stephen Curry (54-for-57) did it . Butler is now the third player in Finals history to achieve that 90-on-50 mark. He has 12 more attempts and 19 more makes than any other player in the series. And the Heat needed all 12 of those free throws on Friday. With the game on the line, the Lakers couldn\u2019t keep him from getting into the paint. With his team down 106-105, Butler rejected a screen and drew a foul on Markieff Morris, putting the Heat ahead with two freebies with 46.7 seconds left. After Davis put the Lakers up 108-107 with a put-back, Butler used a Jae Crowder screen, got into the paint again, and drew a foul on Davis. He then put Miami ahead for good with two more freebies with 16.8 seconds left. The Lakers and Heat scored the same number of points on both 2-point shots (48) and 3-point shots (42) in Game 5. The difference was at the line, where the Heat were 21-for-22 and the Lakers were 18-for-21. Butler has something to do with that latter number, too. He\u2019s a physical offensive player without being too physical on the other end of the floor. He\u2019s committed just 1.6 fouls per 36 minutes, third fewest among 75 players who\u2019ve played at least 200 postseason minutes. And he now has 41 steals with just 34 personal fouls in the playoffs.

Davis immediately limped toward the baseline and crumpled to the ground wincing in pain. Davis headed back to the bench after Lakers athletic trainers took a look at the injured foot, and the team announced he would be available to return as the forward paced the sidelines trying to regain mobility in the injured area. Davis said that Miami\u2019s Andre Iguodala \u201ckind of just stepped on\u201d his right foot and \u201cre-aggravated\u201d it. Davis never headed back to the locker room for Lakers athletic trainers to take a closer look. Davis left the game with 48.4 seconds remaining in the first quarter and re-entered in the second quarter at the 8:30 mark with his team trailing by eight points (38-30). Despite the early injury, Davis still managed to play a team-high 42:13, scoring 28 points on 9-of-15 from the field to go with 12 rebounds. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior, man. Just him being out there hobbled just brings a lot more confidence to myself and my team,\u201d said LeBron James, who finished with a game-high 40 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. \u201cWe know the nicks, bumps and bruises he\u2019s played through throughout the whole season.

There\u2019s a vibe to it, an energy when one team smells that first opportunity to get their hands on that coveted Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy and ascend to that special place only the championship teams can. But as we\u2019ve been over so many times here already, there is nothing normal about this NBA season, nothing familiar. > Finals Game 6: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday at 7:30 ET on ABC Not one thing. Hunting for clues in the lead up to Friday night\u2019s Game 5 between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat proved futile in the bubble. The absence of the usual markers made it impossible to get a read on what the Lakers would do with the 3-1 lead they earned heading into Friday night\u2019s festivities at AdventHealth Arena. The Heat, backs against the wall and their season on the line, were equally difficult to figure on the most critical night of the season for both teams. No reminders were needed. The first all-or-nothing game of this or any Finals has a rhythm of its own. No fear \u2014 from either side. Just the most highly competitive game of the season *** 24 \u2014 OK AD, calling his shot with the Larry O\u2019Brien edition Kobes. A lot of symbolism in the approach to this night, this game and what the Lakers hope is a huge moment for them tonight.

Dwight Howard and Bam get tangled up on one end. Jimmy Butler is not having any of it and gets tangled up with Dwight on the other end. Double T\u2019s on Jimmy and Dwight. Tone set. Let\u2019s get it on! https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=Dwight&src=trend_click&vertical=trends 22 \u2014 Put this Duncan Robinson put-back on top of the list of things I didn\u2019t expect to see tonight. Michigan Man making an impact early with 8 points on 3-for-5 shooting to pace the Heat to a 25-24 first quarter lead. 21 \u2014 Absolute silence from the Lakers\u2019 bench and family section as AD has to be helped to his feet and then to the bench. Not clear what happened or what was injured. But I already know what the AD watchers are thinking \u2026 (The official word? An aggravated right heel contusion and he\u2019ll be able to return.) 20 \u2014 Prayers worked. He\u2019s back. But the Lakers are still off balance under the constant attack from the Heat (42-33 with 6:33 to play before halftime.) https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheNBPA\/status\/1314745354697478144 But Davis doesn\u2019t look right \u2026 And let the foolishness begin \u2026 19 \u2014 LeBron is keeping the Lakers in this game right now with his shooting. Three-time Finals MVP needs some serious help if he\u2019s going to get a fourth tonight. 18 \u2014 Heat can\u2019t hold the lead. LeBron and the are Lakers pressing and fighting their way back into this game the hard way. 17 \u2014 Second quarter was a blur. The kind of back-and-forth you\u2019d expect from a game of this magnitude. Heat lead but have plenty to clean up if the bubble is going to stay open for business this weekend. 16 \u2014 That said, Gary Payton\u2019s words for The Players\u2019 Tribune proved prophetic through the first half \u2026 1 5 \u2014 LeBron was a monster. Hit the 3s to settle the Lakers and keep them within striking distance, at 60-56. 14 \u2014 Heat leading behind Butler\u2019s 22 points and solid support from Kendrick Nunn (11) off the bench, Robinson (10) and Herro (8). Doing it with Bam (5 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists) yet to put a real mark on this game. He and or Jae Crowder (4) have to crank it up in the second half if the Heat want to spend a couple more days here. 13 \u2014 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope gets us back to even at 70 with 7 minutes to play in the third with a huge 3-pointer. It\u2019s on from this point on. Anybody\u2019s game. Should be clear by now to the Lakers that they will not get that trophy without a furious fight. Love the way the Heat are competing. Playing without any fear or pressure. Butler is leveling up in a major way in this series. Time to elevate his status? 12 \u2014 The hoop and the harm for Butler. Dwight with the Flagrant 1 or 2 here? 11 \u2014 This has not been Dwight\u2019s finest hour in this series. Not by a long stretch. Lakers are more effective and much more sound (none of the shenanigans) with AD at the 5 and Markieff Morris on the floor. 10 \u2014 This duel between Butler and LeBron has been everything it was advertised to be and then some. They\u2019re going at it, doing it all on both ends and leading the way you\u2019d expect alphas to on this stage. Heat up 88-82 after three. Butler with 27 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists on 9\/13 shooting in 35 minutes. LeBron with 28 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists on 11\/14 shooting (5\/7 from deep) in 30 minutes. 9 \u2014 That Heat math is no joke! (just add, subtract, multiply and divide whatever is by 3)! 8 \u2014 Robinson showing up in a major way in this one. He\u2019s up to 23 points (6-for-11 from deep) with the Heat up 93-85 with 9:23 to play in the game. 7 \u2014 Sweet feed from LeBron to KCP for the corner 3 and the Lakers take the 97-96 lead with 6:18 to play. Not sure how anyone disputes the fact that LeBron is the ultimate hybrid star for this or any generation: Passes like a point guard, big as a power forward and tonight shooting it like a Splash Brother from deep (6-8 3Ps). He\u2019s up to 33, 10 and 7, making it impossible for anyone else to get Finals MVP in this series. 6 \u2014 Can he get an Amen! 5 \u2014 AD with a huge putback with 21.8 seconds left gives the Lakers a 108-107 lead. Unbelievable finish to this game. Butler and LeBron dueling before AD interrupted with this one. The Heat missed that box out. Will haunt them if they can\u2019t find a way to win this game. 4 \u2014 Final three minutes was off the chains drama. Folks in the building still trying to catch their breath. 3 \u2014 It was these two battling all the way to the end. Instant classic. All-time great Finals battle between two cats who refused to give up an inch.  2 \u2014 Erik Spoelstra goes with the 7-man rotation and squeezes every ounce out of his guys. Duncan Robinson goes off. AD limps to the finish and we get to debate LeBron\u2019s decision to kick it out to Danny Green and the fallout (Morris with the pass to no one) endlessly, or at least until Game 6 tips off Sunday night. 1 \u2014 Pat Riley was smiling from behind that glass. He wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Butler and the Heat youngsters (Robinson, Herro and Nunn) come up huge! Unreal finish!

(AP) \u2014 The NBA is returning to Chinese state television after a one-year absence. CCTV announced Friday that it would air Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat \u2014 the first time that the league would appear on the network since the rift that started when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. State television made an on-air announcement that the game would be broadcast; the network\u2019s web site had a preview of the game, including a photo of the Lakers\u2019 LeBron James and Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler. CCTV quickly halted its relationship with the NBA after Morey\u2019s tweet, even though the post was quickly deleted. Given the timing, it appears the suspension of NBA coverage by that network was designed to last one year; CCTV announced on Oct. 8, 2019, that it was beginning an immediate investigation into its relationship with the NBA, stemming from the network being \u201cstrongly dissatisfied\u201d over the league\u2019s decision to not sanction Morey. The NBA did not have an immediate comment to CCTV\u2019s decision. NBA games have been available to Chinese fans on the streaming service Tencent, another of the league\u2019s broadcast partners. And the relationship between the league and China could be best categorized as frosty since. NBA legend and Chinese Basketball Association President Yao Ming did come to the U.S. to attend the memorial service for commissioner emeritus David Stern in January, a move viewed by some as one that showed there was hope for the league and China to mend fences. But the fallout after the tweet last year was quick and massive. Sponsors \u2014 following CCTV\u2019s lead \u2014 pulled their backing of the NBA China Games between the Lakers and Brooklyn Nets; the preseason games were played, though no news conferences were held and most events surrounding the games in the basketball-mad nation were canceled as well. At All-Star weekend this year, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said it was possible the league could lose as much as $400 million in revenue this year because of the strained relationship with the Chinese. And that estimate preceded the costly shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, another massive financial blow that forced the league to cancel about 15% of its remaining regular-season games. The league wound up salvaging the season by moving into a bubble at Walt Disney World, yet another big expense for games that took place without fans present \u2014 meaning no ticket, concession or souvenir revenue."},{"id":62649,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rajon-rondo-gearing-nba-title-lakers","date":"2020-10-09","title":"Rajon Rondo on cusp of making some NBA history","content":" They were rivals once, Rajon Rondo and LeBron James. Rondo was in Boston. James was in Cleveland and Miami. Their paths would cross most every year in the playoffs, an annual placing of a thorn in one another\u2019s side. James may have had different words to describe Rondo then. > Finals Game 5: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday at 9 ET on ABC These days, however, the words James uses when speaking of the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 backup point guard include cerebral and determined. And that approach \u2014 smart and tough \u2014 has Rondo on the doorstep of a most exclusive club. Rondo helped the Boston Celtics win their 17th NBA championship. He\u2019s on the brink of being part of title No. 17 for the Lakers as well, something that could come as early as Friday night when they take on the Miami Heat in Game 5 of these NBA Finals. The Lakers lead the series 3-1. \u201cI won at (22) years old, and now being 34, it\u2019s a completely different experience, and understanding that this doesn\u2019t come often or annually,\u201d Rondo said earlier in the series. \u201cBeing back here over a decade later is a very humbling experience.\u201d The Celtics and the Lakers have long been the NBA\u2019s royal families, the leaders in titles and probably the league\u2019s best rivalry. Plenty of players have played for both franchises \u2014 but only one, Hall of Fame forward Clyde Lovellette, played on championship teams with both clubs. And even that comes with a tiny asterisk; Lovellette won titles in 1963 and 1964 with the Celtics, and his first ring came in 1954 when the then-Minneapolis Lakers. So, Rondo could be the first to win a title for both Boston and Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate and blessed to continue playing this game for this long,\u201d Rondo said. In total, 35 players have suited up for both the Lakers and Celtics in their careers. The names are: Chucky Atkins, Jim Barnes, Brandon Bass, Mike Bloom, Vander Blue, Avery Bradley, Frank Brickowski, MarShon Brooks, Don Chaney, Mel Counts, Ernie DiGregorio, Hank Finkel, Rick Fox, Jumaine Jones, Joe Kleine, Travis Knight, Clyde Lovellette, Bob McAdoo, Chris Mihm, Troy Murphy, Don Nelson, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Gary Payton, Theo Ratliff, Fred Roberts, Rajon Rondo, Charlie Scott, Brian Shaw, Derek Strong, Gene Stump, Earl Tatum, Isaiah Thomas, Von Wafer, Kermit Washington and Shammond Williams. James still remembers playoff matchups in 2008 and 2010, when he was in Cleveland and Rondo was with Boston. The Celtics had more talent than those Cavs teams and won both matchups; the 2010 series ended James\u2019 first stint in Cleveland and ultimately sent him to Miami. While the talent disparity between the teams was noticed by James, so was this: Rondo would call out Cleveland\u2019s sets every time down the floor. He knew what was coming. James was simultaneously frustrated and impressed by Rondo\u2019s ability to predict movement in real time. When the Lakers had a chance to get Rondo, they didn\u2019t hesitate \u2014 so clearly, James was more than fine with the move. He loves smart teammates. Rondo more than fits that bill. \u201cRajon is a huge part of what we do,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cI have a tremendous amount of trust in his abilities, especially in this atmosphere, this deep into the playoffs when the games mean so much. He\u2019s been there before, and I trust him.\u201d With good reason. He\u2019s not the All-Star that he once was, but the toughness hasn\u2019t gone away. Rondo and Heat forward Jimmy Butler are friends and former teammates; Rondo thinks nothing of trash-talking Butler during a game, to the point where sometimes both are laughing. \u201cRondo is always saying something to me during the game,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for the guy, a lot of love for the guy, him and his family. Obviously, he played with me in Chicago, so there\u2019s always some jawing going back and forth.\u201d In winning time, though, Rondo lets the play do the talking. Consider the last six minutes of Game 4 of the finals. Rondo checked back in with the Lakers up 85-83. He helped force a Miami turnover, got an offensive rebound that led to two free throws by James, scored his only points of the night on a layup that put the Lakers up by six, then had the pass that set up Anthony Davis\u2019 game-sealing 3-pointer with 39.5 seconds remaining. Nobody on the Lakers calls him Playoff Rondo. He doesn\u2019t like the moniker much, even though many use it freely when talking about him during the postseason. But he showed why the name has stuck, with yet another example of him coming through in the biggest moments of the biggest games. \u201cThis opportunity doesn\u2019t come often,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cGuys search for this moment their entire career, and we definitely have to seize the moment.\u201d"},{"id":62636,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/miami-heat-finals-men-arena-roosevelt","date":"2020-10-09","title":"Men in the Arena: Heat believe this is 'where they're meant to be'","content":" With the 2020 general election looming, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra invoked variations of former president Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s quote from a 1910 speech to relay his team\u2019s mentality heading into Game 5 of The Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. On multiple occasions, Spoelstra discussed Miami being \u201cmarred by dust, blood, sweat and tears,\u201d while pointing out that \u201cour guys are the ones out there.\u201d Here\u2019s what Roosevelt, the nation\u2019s 26th president, said in one of his most widely quoted speeches, \u201cCitizenship in a Republic\u201d: They\u2019ll find out soon enough against a Lakers team led by LeBron James, who has captured victories in 17 of his last 18 career closeout games \u2014 including three in a row in The Finals \u2014 and is prepping to play Game 5 \u201cchanneling that desperation, just knowing that the opponent and the man across from you has that same feeling.\u201d > Finals Game 5: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday at 9 ET on ABC Throw in what James has learned from two-plus seasons wearing a Los Angeles Lakers uniform, and you\u2019ve got the makings of a compelling matchup. The teams tip Friday from the NBA bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort, with Miami trailing 3-1 in this best-of-seven series that concludes the longest season in league history. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned being a Laker is the Laker faithful don\u2019t give a damn what you\u2019ve done before,\u201d said James, who captured three titles and four Kia MVP awards before joining Los Angeles in June 2018. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about your resume at all until you become a Laker. Then, you\u2019ve got to do it as a Laker, and then they\u2019ll respect you.\u201d Interestingly, James made history in 2016, starring for a Cleveland Cavaliers squad that upset the Golden State Warriors and became the first team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in The Finals. The only time Miami has rebounded from a 3-1 deficit to win a series in any round of the postseason was in the 1997 Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks; a fact well-known by this current Heat team. Still, Miami remains undaunted by the enormity of the task. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s pressure,\u201d said Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler. \u201cI think it\u2019s just win. Ain\u2019t nobody thinking about going home over here. It\u2019s just win, so there\u2019s no pressure. We\u2019re expected to win. That\u2019s our job. It\u2019s not win or go home, it\u2019s win or win. That\u2019s how we think about it.\u201d But you can\u2019t help but consider the circumstances leading up to this point. Miami lost two key contributors in All-Star Bam Adebayo (neck strain) and veteran guard Goran Dragic (torn left plantar fascia tear) in Game 1, and both sat out of the next two games before the former returned Tuesday for the Heat\u2019s 102-96 loss in Game 4. Dragic missed Game 4, and his status for Game 5 hasn\u2019t changed, according to Spoelstra. Dragic remains listed as doubtful for Friday\u2019s game, which keeps the burden of production on both sides of the floor on Butler, who has played 43 minutes or more in each of the last three games of this series, including nearly 45 minutes in Games 2 and 3. Let\u2019s also not forget that Dragic entered these Finals as Miami\u2019s leading scorer. Still, Butler smiled when asked about Miami\u2019s confidence facing elimination, while Spoelstra pointed to the importance of the Heat simply focusing on the task at hand. \u201cLook, we think it\u2019s a really competitive series,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe have a purpose of why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re competing for a title, and it\u2019s the first team to four wins. There\u2019s a lot of different narratives out there. We don\u2019t give a [expletive] what everybody else thinks. This is everything that we wanted this year; an opportunity to fight for, compete for a title, and that hasn\u2019t changed at all through these first games.\u201d Apparently, Los Angeles shares a similar sentiment, and plans to wear its Kobe Bryant-designed \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d jerseys for Game 5. Originally, the Lakers planned to wear those uniforms for Game 7 but will now sport them in Friday\u2019s closeout opportunity. It\u2019s important to note Los Angeles is 4-0 this season in those uniforms. \u201cIf we come out and do what we\u2019re supposed to do, then we can remain undefeated,\u201d said Lakers forward Anthony Davis, who joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Tuesday as the only players to average 25 points or more (25.8) on better than 60 percent (60.6%) from the field through their first four NBA Finals games. \u201cWe just think that for all the things that happened this season, with our team specifically and our organization, that to be able to close it out in the Black Mamba uniforms will just make it all worth it. \u201cObviously, his legacy in the NBA and then with the organization, period, is something special. For us to close it out in his honor is something we look forward to. An insane amount of pressure for sure, but we don\u2019t want to lose. We don\u2019t want to let him down.\u201d As for Spoelstra, the coach declined to go into specifics regarding any potential motivational tactics for Game 5. They\u2019re not needed, he stressed. Instead, Spoelstra ended his Thursday post-practice availability by again invoking a portion of Roosevelt\u2019s speech. \u201cOur guys don\u2019t need stabilization. We don\u2019t need a character test,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a competitive temperature. We all know where our guys are. We are here for a purpose. We are trying to compete for a title. That has not changed. And for our players, our guys are the ones in the arena marred by sweat, tears, blood.

For Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, it\u2019s the little things that count. Sure, he\u2019s one win away from claiming the fourth championship of his career and potentially his fourth Finals MVP. But his legacy isn\u2019t on his mind. That\u2019s for another day. > Finals Game 5: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday at 9 ET on ABC A Wheaties box featuring students from his I Promise School in his hometown of Akron, however, strikes him. It\u2019s next level, even for a man playing in his 10th Finals and collecting statistical milestones with every minute he continues to play in his 17th season. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about it too much,\u201d he said when asked about his legacy. \u201cI think the story will be told how it\u2019s supposed to be told and be written how it\u2019s supposed to be written. But I don\u2019t live my life thinking about legacy. What I do off the floor is what means more to me than what I do on the floor. Seeing my kids on the back of a Wheaties box yesterday was one of the best moments of my life \u2026 The game of basketball will pass me by. There will be a new group of young kids and vets and rookies throughout the course of this game. \u201cSo I can\u2019t worry about that as far as on the floor. How I move, how I walk, what I preach, what I talk about, how I inspire the next generation is what matters to me the most. And if you appreciate my game, then cool. If you didn\u2019t, then that\u2019s cool, too. That\u2019s what it boils down to.\u201d Don\u2019t look for the Heat to be intimidated by the circumstances of Game 5, down 3-1 with their \u201cbacks against the wall,\u201d as Bam Adebayo put it . This is, after all, a team filled with underdogs and a franchise that has made its mark playing with a giant chip on its shoulder under the guidance of Pat Riley. They got a timely and inspirational reminder of what Heat culture means Thursday morning from Hall of Fame point guard and champion Gary Payton, who penned an ode to the organization that was published by The Players\u2019 Tribune Thursday morning. His words struck a nerve with Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who was a Riley assistant on that 2006 championship team. \u201cI was really moved by it, particularly coming from GP,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cI had goose bumps. It was just the right timing, and what a pleasant surprise, to come from one of the former champions. He knows how difficult competing for a title is, regardless of how you get there, what the score is in the series. At this point, it\u2019s the first team to four. That\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d LeBron said he had nothing to do with the Lakers deciding to wear their \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d uniforms for Game 5 and wasn\u2019t sure who made that call. He\u2019s all in, though, as are the rest of the Lakers. \u201cObviously, until you get your hands on them, you don\u2019t get to see the detail in them,\u201d James said of the uniforms. \u201cIt\u2019s super-duper detailed. It has that snake Mamba print on it. It means something. Something more than just a uniform. It represents an individual who gave the franchise 20 years of his blood, sweat and tears and his dedication to his craft, both on and off the floor, to make that franchise be proud of him, and hopefully vice versa.\u201d They\u2019re undefeated this season in those uniforms and have an opportunity to hone the franchise legend months after Bryant, his daughter, GiGi, and seven others passed away in a January helicopter crash north of Los Angeles. \u201cJust to be playing in the Mamba jersey (is) humbling to us and means a lot,\u201d Kentavious Caldwell-Pope said . \u201cWe say we don\u2019t want to lose in the Mamba jerseys, which we haven\u2019t done yet. We\u2019re here to take the last game.\u201d The uniforms clearly carry added weight with different players. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for me, man,\u201d Markieff Morris said . \u201cGrowing up in the Philadelphia area, a lot of us idolized Kobe being from Philly.\u201d For Anthony Davis, it\u2019s about all that and more. \u201cIf we come out and do what we\u2019re supposed to do, then we can remain undefeated,\u201d he said . \u201cWe just think that for all the things that happened this season, with our team specifically and our organization, that to be able to close it out in the Black Mamba uniforms will just make it all worth it. Obviously his legacy in the NBA and then just with the organization, period, is something special, and for us to close it out in his honor is something that we look forward to.\u201d He continued: \u201cIf we come in and do the things that we\u2019re supposed to do on both ends of the floor, then we can remain undefeated and close this thing out and make this moment even more special.\u201d He considers himself one of the most diligent students of the game, so it wasn\u2019t a heavy lift to LeBron\u2019s system when he immersed himself in the culture of one of the most storied franchises in all of sports, and especially the NBA. He certainly has learned a few things along the way, particularly about Lakers\u2019 fans and their extremely high standards for the players who represent the franchise. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned being a Laker is that the Laker faithful don\u2019t give a damn what you\u2019ve done before,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil you become a Laker, you\u2019ve got to do it with them, as well. They don\u2019t care about your resume at all until you become a Laker. Then you\u2019ve got to do it as a Laker, and then they respect you.

This is the first NBA Basketball Executive of the Year Award for Frank, who has served in the Clippers\u2019 front office since 2016 after spending 20 years in the NBA coaching ranks. Frank received 10 of 29 first-place votes and earned 61 total points from a panel of team basketball executives throughout the NBA. Oklahoma City Thunder Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti finished in second place with 41 points (four first-place votes), followed by Miami Heat President Pat Riley in third place with 39 points (four first-place votes). Executives were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30 \u2013 Aug. 14 as part of the season restart, did not count toward voting for the NBA Basketball Executive of the Year Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards. Frank assembled a roster that posted a 44-20 record in games played through March 11, the second-best mark in the Western Conference. Using 29 different starting lineups in 64 games during that period, the Clippers relied on their depth to earn a playoff berth for the eighth time in the last nine seasons. With Frank leading the Basketball Operations department, LA\u2019s roster for the 2019-20 season took shape in July 2019 with the signing of two-time Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Kawhi Leonard as a free agent and the acquisition of six-time NBA All-Star Paul George in a trade with the Thunder. In games played through March 11, Leonard averaged 26.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists and George averaged 21.0 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists. Leonard, a two-time Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and George, a four-time NBA All-Defensive Team selection, helped the Clippers rank fifth in the NBA in defensive rating in games played through March 11 \u2013 up from a season-ending ranking of 19th last season. Other moves last offseason included re-signing starting guard Patrick Beverley, starting center Ivica Zubac and forward JaMychal Green. Frank and the Clippers also moved to bolster the roster during the 2019-20 season, acquiring starting forward Marcus Morris Sr. from the New York Knicks as part of a three-team trade on Feb. 6 and signing guard Reggie Jackson on Feb. 20 after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. Frank joined the Clippers as an assistant coach in 2014. He stayed in that role for two seasons before moving into the front office as Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2016. Frank was promoted to President of Basketball Operations in August 2017. His NBA tenure includes head coaching stints with the Pistons and New Jersey Nets and assistant coaching roles with the Nets, Vancouver Grizzlies and Boston Celtics."},{"id":24126,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/giannis-antetokounmpo-thanasis-antetokounmpo-appear-madden-21","date":"2020-10-08","title":"Giannis Antetokounmpo to appear in Madden 21","content":" Two Kia MVPs.

Against the league\u2019s top-10 defenses , the difference was greater (109.9 vs. 107.3). > Finals Game 5: Friday, 9 p.m. ET on ABC The Heat are difficult to defend, with multiple shooters constantly moving around Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. In the conference semifinals, the Heat scored 11.1 more points per 100 possessions than the Milwaukee Bucks allowed in the first round. In the conference finals, they scored 12 more than the Boston Celtics allowed in the conference semis. Over Games 2 and 3 of The Finals (without Adebayo), the Heat scored more per 100 ( 120.5 ) than the Lakers had allowed in any two-game stretch in these playoffs. But in Game 4, the Lakers\u2019 defense was better than that Heat offense, which has now had two of their three least efficient postseason games in this series. Davis was a huge part of that, but the Lakers\u2019 guards also played a part in some key stops on Tuesday. The most common matchup in Game 4 was Jimmy Butler guarding James. The second most common matchup was Davis guarding Butler. And Davis defended Butler (who ranked last in effective field goal percentage on shots outside the paint among 190 players who attempted at least 200 in the regular season) much like Butler defended James: by going under screens. Of course, Davis playing soft can make it tougher to defend dribble hand-offs (DHO). Midway through the third quarter, Butler sprung Duncan Robinson for a 3-pointer that Davis wasn\u2019t in position to contest when Kentavious Caldwell-Pope went under the pick himself. A couple of minutes later, Rajon Rondo went over the DHO and Davis jumped out to prevent a Robinson 3-pointer, before recovering quickly to defend Butler in the paint (with some weak-side help) \u2026 After averaging 48 points in the paint through the first three games, the Heat had just 32 in Game 4 . The game was still tight in the fourth quarter, in part because the Heat had a couple of fortunate buckets: Tyler Herro hitting a ridiculously high floater over Davis and Robinson banking in a late-clock 3-pointer . The fourth was the Heat\u2019s most efficient period of the night. But the Lakers still got a few critical stops down the stretch. One was an after-timeout (ATO) possession in which James and Kyle Kuzma prevented another Robinson hand-off 3-pointer, with Alex Caruso recovering out to Herro after tagging Bam Adebayo\u2019s roll to the rim and then containing Herro\u2019s off-the-dribble attack. Caruso then got around a Robinson hand-off for Herro and forced a tough, pull-up jumper as the shot clock expired. Two minutes later, Caruso switched onto Robinson, denied a hand-off, and then helped off Robinson when Rondo trailed the ensuing hand-off to Herro, forcing a travel. The guys Caruso was defending were 1-for-6 with two turnovers in Game 4. With the Lakers up six with a little more than a minute to go, the Heat ran another hand-off play, where Adebayo set an initial screen for Robinson. The Lakers smoothly executed a triple-switch, where Rondo went from chasing Robinson to defending Adebayo\u2019s roll to the rim, James went from guarding Adebayo to guarding Butler, and Davis switched off Butler to prevent Robinson from shooting. There was a split second there where Butler could have aborted the hand-off and hit Adebayo on the roll before Rondo got back into the paint. But with it being a six-point game, the Heat were probably looking for a 3-pointer. They ended up getting another contested mid-range shot from Herro at the end of the shot clock. This is still the fourth most efficient series (both teams combined) of the 15 in these playoffs. But in Games 1 and 4, the Lakers have shown the ability to stop the Heat\u2019s multi-faceted offense, defending the 3-point line by chasing shooters around those hand-offs, while also protecting the rim with the size and quickness of Davis and James. The Heat had the more efficient offense this season, but the Lakers had the league\u2019s third-ranked defense . This is the best defensive team that James has played for since he won his first championship with the Heat in 2011. If the Lakers can continue to get stops in Game 5 on Friday ( 9 p.m. ET, ABC ), the Heat will be on the other side of his fourth. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2014 Udonis Haslem is honest about it: Elections simply have not been overly important to him. That is, until now. He\u2019s been a registered voter since 2004, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been unaware of the process or how it works. But it\u2019s also been far from a passion project for Haslem, the Miami Heat forward who serves as a team captain and tries to set an example for every other player in the locker room. So, this year, that meant getting involved in the election process. \u201cGrowing up in my household, voting was never a conversation,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cVoting was never a conversation when I went to school. It definitely wasn\u2019t a conversation when I was hanging out with my homeboys. There was just never a conversation. So, for me to be able to be a leader in this league and to be able to be a leader on my team, I had to educate myself.\u201d This is why Haslem and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, players on different sides of this year\u2019s NBA Finals, are teammates once again \u2014 just as they were in Miami from 2010 through 2014. Haslem is one of more than 50 Black athletes and entertainers who are lending their celebrity and influence to the \u201cMore Than A Vote\u201d campaign, a group headlined by James and formed not long after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were part of what reignited the quest to eliminate racial inequality and police brutality in this country. The group\u2019s primary mission right now: defeat what it calls \u201csystemic, targeted voter suppression\u201d and protect Black voters. \u201cI know we\u2019re here playing the game, but I\u2019m not losing the fact of what\u2019s important as well,\u201d James said earlier in these playoffs. \u201cMore than a vote, it\u2019s about protecting Black voters and voter suppression that goes on in our communities. \u2026 We always talk about change in our communities, and now we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to really create change for the better.\u201d The numbers, so far, are to James\u2019 liking: The National Basketball Players Association says almost all eligible voters within its membership are now registered, something that had been a major undertaking inside the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World \u2014 where the app players downloaded to learn their way around the bubble even included directions on how to register. More than half of the NBA\u2019s arenas, all of which would be otherwise sitting empty on election day, have either been registration-drive sites or will serve as polling locations \u2014 a player demand when the season was nearly called off in August because of more racial unrest. And the More Than A Vote group has already recruited 20,000 poll workers for election day around the country. \u201cThese athletes, just like everybody else, had a mix of paralysis \u2014 because we\u2019ve all been unable to do anything \u2014 and rage and anger and frustration,\u201d More Than A Vote\u2019s Executive Vice President of Public Affairs Michael Tyler said. \u201cAnd I think they were actively looking for a way to kind of channel all of those emotions into action. How do you fight back, right? I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been different about this moment. It\u2019s not simply about raising awareness. It\u2019s, \u2018How do I actively leverage my own influence and platform to changing the mechanics of how elections operate?\u2019\u201d James and others lending celebrity weight to the cause knew they couldn\u2019t do this alone. They brought in experts: Tyler was a deputy communications director during Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and executive director Addisu Demissie managed the national campaign for Booker as well as California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s state campaign in 2018. The group is officially nonpartisan, though it\u2019s no secret that James and many others involved in the group are backing Democratic nominee Joe Biden over President Donald Trump. James knows his political views are popular with some, not popular with others. \u201cYou can\u2019t get caught up in what everybody else thinks, because everyone is not going to always agree with your movement,\u201d James said. \u201cEveryone is not going to agree with your words. Everyone is not going to agree with your passion. Everyone is not going to always agree with why you\u2019re doing it, things of that nature. If you\u2019re true to it and it hits home and it hits the heart, then it shouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d NBA teams are getting involved in the election any way possible. Golden State, Atlanta and Detroit are squaring off in a voting registration contest \u2014 seeing who can get the most fans to register to vote. Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who appeared with his wife Ayesha in a video during the Democratic National Convention to endorse Biden, has been active in spreading the get-out-the-vote message and has some additional things planned before the election. The Hawks are among the teams that will pay employees for time spent voting and serving at the polls on Election Day, Nov. 3. Plans in Wisconsin, a likely key battleground state, to use the Milwaukee Bucks and Brewers\u2019 stadiums as early voting sites were scratched this week over fear that the ballots could be legally challenged because those sites had been designated later than required by state law. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get people to vote,\u201d Doc Rivers, now the coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, said during these playoffs when he was coaching the Los Angeles Clippers. \u201cBlack men and Brown men have to vote. Have to vote. The suppression right now has never been higher. Our players understood that, so that\u2019s important. And we\u2019ve just got to keep moving forward.\u201d Haslem has get-out-the-vote initiatives planned for Miami when he returns home from the NBA bubble as well. The days of not talking about voting are long gone, he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how we got a president,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cWe had so many without me having to know. I didn\u2019t think it mattered if I knew.

It remains unclear \u2014 doubtful is probably the best word \u2014 if point guard Goran Dragic can play anytime soon because of the torn plantar fascia in his left foot. But getting All-Star center Bam Adebayo back from a neck injury for Game 4 was a plus, though he confessed he\u2019s not 100%. \u201cI feel like collectively we all need two days off,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s not just Goran, but we all need a couple days just to readjust, realign, get some fresh air and get back to the drawing board.\u201d From the Heat perspective, that is indeed the case. For the Lakers, the waiting may be the hardest part. The chance at the franchise\u2019s first title in 10 years is looming, and James \u2014 who has great respect for Spoelstra, his former Miami coach \u2014 is certain that the Heat won\u2019t go out easily. \u201cI know Spo going into Game 5,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part about it. It\u2019s a chess match.\u201d"},{"id":24134,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-things-learned-2020-finals-game-4","date":"2020-10-07","title":"5 things we learned from Game 4 of 2020 Finals","content":" Five things we learned from the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 102-96 win against the Miami Heat in Game 4 of the 2020 Finals Tuesday in the Orlando bubble: * * * Anthony Davis\u2019 clunker performance in Game 3 (he got outscored and outrebounded by Miami backup center Kelly Olynyk) and LeBron James\u2019 excellence, impact and, yes, \u201cnarrative\u201d make it highly unlikely the Lakers\u2019 All-Star big man can claim the Bill Russell Finals MVP Award while he\u2019s earning his first NBA championship ring. But that\u2019s OK, because Davis is doing enough to win the imaginary Russell Defensive Player of the Finals trophy. Davis\u2019 work in guarding and ostensibly holding down Jimmy Butler Tuesday may prove to be the pivot point for the series. On Sunday, Butler looked like one of the best players on the planet with his 40-point triple-double in the Heat\u2019s feisty victory to keep the series interesting. Forty-eight hours later, though, Davis was unmasking that one-game superhero and returning Butler to mere star status, with 22 points, 10 boards and nine assists not enough for Miami. LeBron James scored 20 in the second half, Davis added 14 and Butler had just nine as L.A. won the last two quarters. \u201cWe feel like we got bullied,\u201d Davis said of Game 3. \u201cWe feel like we got outworked. \u2026 We saw it on film. They were doing whatever they wanted, especially Jimmy. I just wanted to take all that away and just make it difficult for him.\u201d Said James: \u201cThat guy can do everything defensively. Guarding the ball, guard the post, slide his feet with guards, contest, can body up with bigs. I mean, need I say more?\u201d Davis isn\u2019t ready for the \u201c1-through-5\u201d label Miami coach Erik Spoelstra hung on the more versatile James in their four years together. Few coaches, including Spoelstra or the Lakers\u2019 Frank Vogel, would risk a steady diet of Davis on guards. But given Butler\u2019s turf is the mid-range and his game isn\u2019t built on elusiveness, Davis and his four inches of height and length advantage was an asset worth flexing. Davis grabbed nine rebounds and blocked four shots, three of them in the fourth quarter, which meant he held down Butler without abandoning rim protection. Butler was essentially dared to shoot from 3-point range, and missed his three attempts. Even though there\u2019s no official defensive award in the playoffs or Finals, Davis made sure this Butler does not do it. More than a few irritated Lakers fans have wondered over the past two seasons if Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was kept around \u2014 to the point of not being shipped to New Orleans in the 2019 Davis trade \u2014 mostly because he uses the same agents at Klutch Sports as James and Davis. For NBA fans less emotionally involved, Caldwell-Pope may have been little more than a contender for the league\u2019s longest name, along with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Michael Carter-Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. But the 27-year-old native of Georgia has been valuable through this playoff run and was particularly vital in Game 4. He scored 15 points on 6-of-12 shooting, hitting three from the arc and chipping in five assists. His worth often doesn\u2019t jump off the stats sheet, not when he\u2019s shooting 28.6% on 3-pointers and 34.1% overall in The Finals. But the shots he makes and when he makes them argue pretty persuasively that Caldwell-Pope has been indispensable so far. He\u2019s a bargain, too, considering his salary has ticked down the past three years from $17 million in 2017-18 to $12 million in 2018-19 to $8 million this season. And he has been assigned defensively to some of the other guys\u2019 most potent scorers. \u201cFirst of all, I just want to just thank God for me just being in this position,\u201d Caldwell-Pope said. \u201cBut yeah, it means a lot that my teammates lean on me to pick up the energy on the defensive end, and also make shots on the offensive end.\u201d The 6-foot-5 guard and former No. 8 pick in the 2013 draft scored 10 points in the first quarter Tuesday. But his biggest impact came much later. After Butler missed a corner 3-pointer with the Heat down 90-88 and three minutes left, James pushed the ball up court. He found Caldwell-Pope, who had raced to the right corner and sank a 3-pointer to increase L.A.\u2019s lead. After a Miami turnover, Caldwell-Pope\u2019s driving layup past Duncan Robinson made it 95-88 heading into the last two minutes. \u201cBig guts to take the shots that he took,\u201d Vogel said, \u201cand it was a huge five points.\u201d Said Caldwell-Pope on his in\/out pattern of contributing: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to knock down every shot you shoot, but just staying with that flow. Drive, get a foul, go to the free-throw line and try to get a rhythm there, or just play the game. Make plays. Do other things.\u201d And that\u2019s a key ingredient in whether they prevail or even extend these Finals. Miami\u2019s offense looked stagnant in Game 4 compared to how it had played for most of the postseason. A team that moves and cuts lapsed into a lot of isolation. Some of that seemed due to Butler as he searched for his proper line in this game \u2014 scorer? creator? \u2014 and some of it undoubtedly points back to point guard Goran Dragic\u2019s unavailability from the torn plantar fascia in his left foot. But we\u2019d be trying too hard for insider insight if we ignored the elephant in this particular gym. The Heat are getting beat in an area where they excelled this season. After ranking sixth in 3-pointers made in the regular season \u2014 nearly 200 more than the Lakers, 979-782 \u2014 they have made 14 fewer, 59-45, through four games in The Finals. Even after folks looked cross-eyed at the Lakers for their uncharacteristic number of attempts, it turns out they have been a tad more accurate (35.5% vs. 35.2%), too. That\u2019s a difference of 42 points from the arc, in a series where the teams are separated by 23, 446-423. Credit the Lakers\u2019 revived defense for their diligent and energetic contesting out to the arc. A ray of hope for the Heat? They took seven 3-pointers in the final quarter of Game 4 and made five. They need to hope that carries over more than the 6-for-25 they shot in the first three quarters. Real life beats Hollywood in almost every way when it comes to sports, from dramatic moments to improbable outcomes. But we\u2019re sticking with the scripted stuff in one category, after hearing about LeBron\u2019s allegedly inspiring, uh, text message in the hours before Game 4. Turns out the Lakers\u2019 all-timer woke up from his usual pregame nap thinking about what was at stake Tuesday: either a dominant 3-1 lead in the series that offers his fourth championship ring, or a 2-2 reset against an opponent gaining confidence. Easy choice. So James texted his afternoon thought to his teammates, a post-nap message that told them he considered the evening\u2019s work to be \u201cmust win.\u201d And win they did, in spite of a lackluster first half that ended when James didn\u2019t bother to push the ball in the final 3.1 seconds. This is another area where new technology might not scratch the old itches. There\u2019s little satisfaction in hanging up on somebody when we can\u2019t slam our smartphones down, and there\u2019s not much drama in an afternoon text compared to inspirational sports speeches of yore. Imagine Norman Dale as Gene Hackman trying to get his \u201cHoosiers\u201d fired up by pecking in a couple hundred characters on a flip phone. Would Al Pacino\u2019s \u201cinches\u201d speech at halftime from \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d play as well if he posted that on Instagram? Of course not. And there\u2019s no way a glowing screen in the palm of one\u2019s hand could do justice to Knute Rockne\u2019s famous \u201cwin one for the Gipper\u201d speech from All American. Besides, any Laker who didn\u2019t grasp the opportunity at hand Wednesday probably is named Earl Smith III. Nothing captures the predicament in which Miami finds itself than this bit of video from the pregame period, when point guard Goran Dragic realized and \u2018fessed up that, no, his aching left foot would not allow him to compete. Getting Adebayo back with nary a sign of his neck and shoulder strain was a boost to the Heat both on the court and emotionally. The tenacious defender and welcome scorer had 15 points and seven rebounds, finishing as a plus-3 in 33 minutes. But Dragic, whose plantar fasciitis always was the greater concern, seemed especially missed from Game 4. Kendrick Nunn, who had stepped in previously and for most of the season, came off the bench to shoot 2-for-11. Tyler Herro continues to write \u201cyoungest ever to\u2026\u201d Finals history. But if you\u2019re starting him, you\u2019re losing his impact as a reserve. And even beyond Dragic\u2019s scoring contributions, his orchestration and pace in running Miami\u2019s attack has been absent at the worst possible time. That doesn\u2019t even address his individual plight. When the Heat beat Boston in the East finals, it was clear from Spoelstra\u2019s comments about Dragic \u2014 acquired in the same summer of 2014 in which James left to return to Cleveland \u2014 how much the coach and the organization appreciated the veteran\u2019s loyalty and work. That his taste of The Finals might end after 15 minutes in Game 1, with a painful and series-wiping foot injury, seems \u2014 in the context of sports \u2014 almost cruel. Here\u2019s to healing with an extra day before Game 5. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Suitcases will get packed, hotels will empty, airport limos will roll and the Larry O\u2019Brien NBA Championship Trophy will be whisked to the West Coast and join 16 others that are neatly aligned in the Buss family office at the Lakers\u2019 practice facility. Yes, it didn\u2019t matter how gnarly it looked for stretches in Game 4 of The Finals . How LeBron James kept fumbling the ball. How Anthony Davis splattered against the floor multiple times. How the Lakers found themselves in a two-point game with three minutes to play. And especially how they needed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, of all people, to bail them out late. This freaky, unsightly, 102-96 win means the Lakers are up 3-1, just 48 minutes from capturing not the greatest NBA championship ever when the ball goes up Friday, but certainly the most unusual. > Finals Game 5: Friday, 9 p.m. ET on ABC In a nutshell, the Lakers are ready and overly anxious to burst everyone\u2019s bubble. T his appears to be inevitable, because if the Heat couldn\u2019t close the deal even with Bam Adebayo making a spirited return to the lineup , and LeBron and AD not as dominant as Games 1 and 2, how can they possibly deny James his third title with his third team? In the two or three moments of truth, with their Cinderella hopes on the line, the Heat caved to Lakers\u2019 defense and some unlikely L.A. heroes in the final few minutes. Jimmy Butler, so brilliant in the previous game, was quiet when it counted. His teammates, so feisty throughout this Orlando restart, couldn\u2019t match the energy displayed by the heavier favored and suddenly hungrier team on the other bench. The Lakers didn\u2019t own the first 45 minutes, but they took ownership of the last three. \u201cWe identified ways to take things from them,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel. \u201cThat\u2019s what the playoffs are about, making those adjustments.\u201d This will be known as the \u201cText Game,\u201d one that could only occur in a viral world, where LeBron used his cell phone earlier in the day to remind his teammates that they should be the more desperate team that night and not Miami, despite being up 2-1. \u201cI feel like for me personally this was one of the biggest games of my career,\u201d he explained. \u201cI just wanted to relay that message.\u201d Maybe the idea of this series turning was all wishful thinking, anyway. Because the Lakers are clearly the superior team and in these type of games, those teams usually find a way to win. S o here we are, the Lakers with the chance to send everyone home and prepared to close the curtain on this improbable and complicated NBA season that began 12 months ago. That would also be an apt description of Tuesday\u2019s game, where LeBron had eight points and five turnovers at halftime and Davis was pummeled and fell to the court three different times, each with grimace but no harm done. He and LeBron eventually recovered \u2014 not so for the Heat. With the Lakers up two late, Butler was open for a 3-pointer. Understand that this isn\u2019t a comfort area for Butler; he didn\u2019t attempt a single shot from this distance in his 40-point Game 3 outburst and is essentially an old-school, mid-range kind of scorer. Butler missed, LeBron grabbed the rebound and headed up court. Twenty years or so ago, before the NBA went 3-point nutty, players on the wings of fast breaks would fill the lane, hoping for a bounce pass and an easy basket. Well, nobody does that anymore. Players now instinctively run to the corners. It\u2019s a crazy idea, passing up a potential layup for a less-efficient shot, but welcome to today\u2019s NBA. Indeed, Caldwell-Pope calls that \u201cmy specialty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always sprinting to the corner,\u201d he explained, \u201cbeing ready to shoot.\u201d And that he did. When the pass from LeBron arrived, Caldwell-Pope\u2019s trigger-fingers were waiting. Curiously, he\u2019s often a target of scorn among Lakers fans, who are perplexed by his streaky nature; Caldwell-Pope missed 21 of 29 shots in the series entering Game 4. But that possession and the next became the greatest of his career. He swished the 3-pointer, and less than a minute later, with the shot clock winding down, he took it off the dribble and gently laid the ball in beyond the outstretched hand of Duncan Robinson for a seven-point lead. Those were certainly the most important five points of the game, and maybe the entire series so far. \u201cHe stays ready,\u201d said LeBron of his fellow Klutch Sports client, who had 15 points and five assists. Davis was just as important at the opposite rim. It was his defense \u2014 with a little help at times from LeBron \u2014 that made all the difference in the final few minutes. Davis was assigned to Butler and after making his first four shots, all in the first quarter, Butler missed 9 of his final 13. \u201cI tried to be locked into him,\u201d said Davis. \u201cHe\u2019s a pest. We tried to give him a different look, make it tough for him. The last game he took over and imposed his will. It was very easy for him in Game 3.\u201d Davis not only smothered Butler when it counted, he finished with four blocked shots and especially flexed in the final minutes. \u201cThat guy can guard everything,\u201d said LeBron, who then tweaked Giannis Antetokounmpo by saying of Davis, \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s the Defensive Player of the Year.\u201d As a bonus: Rajon Rondo missed six shots, but the one he made just happened to stretch the Lakers\u2019 lead in those frantic, delicate minutes and Davis followed up by icing the game with a 3. \u201cMomentum plays, momentum shots,\u201d LeBron called them. And a series where the Lakers, following a brief stumble, regained some momentum, assuming they lost any in the first place. It\u2019s been a long stay for the two teams still standing on the Disney campus. By tipoff Friday, they will have lived there in excess of 100 days. They might have voting rights in the state of Florida. This entire enduring process of being hunkered down in a foreign place has been a test of wills, strength and psychology \u2014 and that\u2019s before getting to the basketball part of it. The pandemic forced the NBA to do something part drastic and part strategic by placing its season and championship run in the hands of Disney. And now the Lakers, finally, can shut it all down. They have James and Davis and are confident that someone from their supporting cast will elevate himself and be a difference maker, too. LeBron and Davis will take their Finals MVP chase down to the wire. LeBron is leading the Lakers in scoring and rebounds and assists, and he has that string of near triple-doubles going for him \u2014 despite an uneven performance, he went 28-12-8 in Game 4 \u2014 while Davis is bringing stellar defensive credentials along with solid offensive outbursts. Of course, the other prize on the line is heftier and more legacy defining for the Laker franchise. They\u2019re on the verge of winning a championship trophy while Miami settles for a good-job, good-effort pat on the back. \u201cWe\u2019ll come out in Game 5,\u201d Davis said, \u201cand hopefully finish it off.\u201d In normal times, most tourists to Disney will return home with a special memento to commemorate the experience. As the Lakers returned a verbal volley to Butler and the Heat by essentially saying, \u201cyou in trouble,\u201d the Larry O\u2019Brien awaits patiently. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

LeBron James and Anthony Davis led the way, combining for 50 points, 21 rebounds and 12 assists. But the Lakers also got a critical contribution from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who scored five of his 15 points on two straight possessions with less than three minutes to go, turning a two-point lead into a seven-point cushion. > Finals Game 5: Friday, 9 p.m. ET on ABC The Heat got Bam Adebayo back from a two-game absence and Jimmy Butler was just one assist away from his second straight triple-double. But Butler and the Heat couldn\u2019t match their scoring output from Game 3 on Sunday. >  NBA.com\/Stats: Game 4 box score One stat stood out from the rest as the Lakers took a 3-1 series lead, with Game 5 on Friday (9 p.m. ET, ABC). 74 \u2014 Miami points on 80 offensive possessions with Anthony Davis on the floor. Through three games, this was the most efficient series (116.3 combined points per 100 possessions) that either team had played in this postseason. Over Games 2 and 3, the Heat scored 120.5 points per 100 possessions , their best two-game stretch of offense since late February. But they were held to just 96 points on 92 possessions (104.3 per 100) on Tuesday. With Butler coming off a 40 point-game (with a career-high 26 points in the paint), Davis was assigned to Butler from the opening tip of Game 4. The Lakers switched a lot of screens for Butler, but Davis played a big role in limiting Butler to a much quieter night (22 points on 8-for-17 shooting). With Davis playing the entire first quarter, the Heat scored just 22 points on 24 possessions. He sat to start the second and the Heat scored on their first eight possessions of the period to turn a five-point deficit into a five point lead. Then Davis checked back in and the Heat scored just eight points over their final 15 possessions of the half. With Davis playing the entire third quarter, the Heat were again held to less than a point per possession (23 on 25). After sitting the first 2:26 of the fourth, he returned to help the Lakers force two straight 24-second violations, swatting Kendrick Nunn on the first. Davis blocked four shots and, according to Second Spectrum tracking, the Heat shot just 6-for-19 on shots he defended. Miami\u2019s 16 field goal attempts in the restricted area in Game 4 are tied for the fewest the Lakers have allowed all season (90 total games). Through 19 playoff games, the Lakers have allowed 7.2 fewer points per 100 possessions with Davis on the floor (106.2) than they have with him on the bench (113.4). You can break down the numbers with Davis at center vs. power forward, but most important is that he\u2019s on the court, period. These Lakers were the best defensive team (allowing 4.0 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average in the regular season) that James has played for since 2011-12, when he won his first championship. They were the first top-10 defensive team ( they ranked third ) that he\u2019s played for since 2015-16 , when he won his third championship. Davis is a big part of that defensive success, and he\u2019s a big reason that James is one win away from championship No. 4.

The emotional boost for the Heat had to be huge. Just knowing that they\u2019d have the player Jimmy Butler refers to as the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the team back in the mix after injuring his left shoulder in Game 1 was the energy boost coach Erik Spoelstra\u2019s team was looking for \u2014 especially with the most consequential game of the series on tap. > Finals Game 5: Friday, 9 p.m. ET on ABC Whether or not a semi-healthy (or at least healthy enough) Adebayo would be the key to a second consecutive Heat win in this series remained to be seen. He still had to deal with the physicality the Lakers would apply. He made the first basket of the game Tuesday, looking as bouncy as he\u2019s been this entire postseason.

But look at this list and tell me Bill Russell wasn\u2019t an absolute monster. Don\u2019t argue eras to me either. He\u2019s the Lord of the Rings and I\u2019m not standing for any disrespect tonight. 20 \u2014 Somebody check Tyler Herro\u2019s body for any possible fractures.

I said, KCP is carrying the Lakers right now!!!! 18 \u2014 Kyle Kuzma\u2019s knocking down shots on one end of the floor and being targeted on the other. I tried to be a little more diplomatic than Perk. 17 \u2014 Don\u2019t want to jinx anything, but Butler is balling again. Any fear factor the Lakers might have enjoyed in Games 1 and 2 is officially gone. The Heat are in this series right now in a major way. 16 \u2014 This is LeBron at his best to me, even at this late(r) stage of his career. Bully ball suits him, even if he rarely utilizes this part of his game. And yes, I know he\u2019s really a point guard these days and thinks the game in ways very few in history have. Sometimes it just makes sense to play to your obvious advantage until the other team finds a way to stop you. 15 \u2014 Legit first half for what\u2019s shaping up as the pivotal game of the series. Spoelstra pushing all the buttons on his coaching keypad. The Bam effect was real (nine points, four rebounds, one block, one steal and three turnovers in 15 minutes). 14 \u2014 Might this help explain some of what\u2019s kept LeBron from going off thus far? LeBron has other ideas. He stopped to chat up the officials as the teams went their separate ways at halftime. He clearly feels like he hasn\u2019t gotten the calls he should in the first half. Be interested to see what sort of adjustments he makes for the second half. 13 \u2014 Filing this one away until the fourth quarter: 12 \u2014 This was crazy in real time. But it\u2019s bonkers in slow motion: 11 \u2014 Numbers never lie, right? #TheLakersRealMVP 10 \u2014 LeBron out here channeling his inner Splash Brother from deep! He and AD have stepped it up in the second half with Markeiff Morris in the starting lineup in place of Dwight Howard. Worked well enough for a 75-70 lead after three quarters. Still doesn\u2019t feel like either team has wrestled complete control of this game away from the other, though. Strange vibe in the building. The Lakers\u2019 family section cheering like they are down instead of leading. 9 \u2014 See, it wasn\u2019t just me noting that strange vibe in the building. 8 \u2014 Heat passed up some quality looks near the basket in favor of hunting 3-pointers, I know you have to play the way you got here and everything, but \u2026 7 \u2014 Hollywood in the bubble rooting on their Lakers. 6 \u2014 This is where not having Goran Dragic\u2019s seasoning and decision-making, especially shot selection, hurts the Heat. No way around it. Glaring difference between a vet and a rookie like Kendrick Nunn, who still hasn\u2019t regained his pre-shutdown rhythm. 5 \u2014 LeBron is working for his on both ends tonight. Tough shot. Tougher camera angle. Heat pushing the Lakers to their limits in this one. Finals drama at its best. 4 \u2014 The Heat won\u2019t go away.

(AP) \u2014 Election officials said Tuesday that they scrapped their plans to use the Milwaukee Bucks and Brewers\u2019 stadiums as early voting sites in the presidential battleground state of Wisconsin, citing fear that the ballots could be legally challenged. Milwaukee\u2019s city election commission had planned to use Fiserv Forum and Miller Park between Oct. 20 and Nov. 1 as sites where people could vote early in-person or return absentee ballots received by mail. The commission developed the plan in an effort to provide safe voting sites during the coronavirus pandemic. But executive director Claire Woodall-Vogg said the plans were being shelved due to concerns that the sites had been designated later than required by state law. The Wisconsin Elections Commission said in a memo Monday that all early voting sites were to have been designated by June 12; the plan for Fiserv and Miller Park was implemented Sept. 1. Woodall-Vogg also noted that a federal judge in Madison last month refused a request to suspend the June deadline and allow clerks to set up additional sites. \u201cWe want residents of Milwaukee to feel complete and unwavering confidence that their ballot will be counted in the election and this action (canceling the plan) reflects that commitment,\u201d she said in a statement. NBA players pushed to allow voting in their arenas as a condition of returning to play after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court for a playoff game following the Aug. 23 shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white police officer in Kenosha. The officer shot Blake in the back seven times, leaving him partially paralyzed. Many in the league of primarily Black players say minorities in many cities need places to vote safely. Atlanta, Detroit, Charlotte, North Carolina, Sacramento, California, New York, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, Utah, all agreed to such plans. The Bucks issued a measured statement on the news. \u201cWhile we were excited to welcome voters to Fiserv Forum to cast their ballots in a safe and accessible way, we remain just as committed to encouraging and educating people to vote and making our voices heard in this election,\u201d the team said. Voting events were still on track in other NBA cities . In Denver, the Pepsi Center was set to open Oct. 30 for early in-person voting or ballot dropoff, and the Nuggets tweeted Tuesday to encourage followers to vote early. In Atlanta, the Hawks\u2019 stadium was used in an August primary and was set to open next week for early voting. The Jazz\u2019s arena in Salt Lake City was to be an Election Day voting site. Brewers officials declined to comment. Republicans across the country have been fighting attempts to expand voting. Wisconsin\u2019s Republican Party sent a warning last week about the Fiserv and Miller Park events, warning that allowing players or mascots to take part would amount to illegal electioneering. Woodall-Vogg said the letter played no role in the cancellation. Wisconsin is expected to be a pivotal state in November after President Donald Trump won it by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Milwaukee and Madison are Democratic strongholds and anything that could make it more difficult to cast a ballot or invalidate ballots could have huge ramifications. Woodall-Vogg noted that the city is still offering 13 in-person early voting locations spread out across the city. \u201cWe are doing everything within our ability to make sure every person in this city has a fair chance to cast a ballot and regret we are not able to pursue the unique opportunity of integrating these two well-known locations,\u201d Mayor Tom Barrett said, referring to Fiserv Form and Miller Park."},{"id":1647,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jrue-holiday-twyman-stokes-award-2020-official-release","date":"2020-10-06","title":"Jrue Holiday wins 2019-20 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 NBA players have selected New Orleans Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday as the recipient of the 2019-20 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award, the NBA announced today. The award, presented annually since the 2012-13 season, recognizes the player deemed the best teammate based on selfless play, on- and off-court leadership as a mentor and role model to other NBA players, and commitment and dedication to team. More than 250 NBA players submitted their votes for the 2019-20 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award through confidential balloting conducted by the league office. NBA players determined the winner from among the 12 nominees who were selected by a panel of league executives. Holiday received 53 of 267 first-place votes and finished with 1,041 total points. Philadelphia 76ers forward Tobias Harris (806 points; 48 first-place votes) and Milwaukee Bucks forward Kyle Korver (796 points; 26 first-place votes) finished in second and third place, respectively. Players were awarded 10 points for each first-place vote, seven points for each second-place vote, five points for each third-place vote, three points for each fourth-place vote and one point for each fifth-place vote. In addition to Holiday, Harris and Korver, the other finalists were Dallas Mavericks guard J.J. Barea, Denver Nuggets forward Torrey Craig, Los Angeles Lakers forward Jared Dudley, Miami Heat forward Udonis Haslem, Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, Toronto Raptors forward-center Serge Ibaka, Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard, San Antonio Spurs guard Patty Mills and Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. Holiday, 30, has spent the last seven seasons with New Orleans after playing his first four seasons with Philadelphia. The 6-3 guard was selected as an NBA All-Star in the 2012-13 season and named to the NBA All-Defensive Team in 2017-18 and 2018-19. In the 2019-20 season, he averaged 19.1 points, 6.7 assists, 4.8 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 61 games across regular-season games and seeding games. In July, Holiday announced that he would use the remainder of his 2019-20 season salary to start a social justice fund with his wife, Lauren, a former player for the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team. The Jrue and Lauren Holiday Social Justice Impact Fund is designed to address socioeconomic inequalities across communities in New Orleans, the Los Angeles area and Indianapolis. Jrue and Lauren are Los Angeles and Indianapolis natives, respectively, and Jrue\u2019s two brothers, Aaron and Justin, both play for the Pacers. T he Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award is named for Jack Twyman and Maurice Stokes, whose storied friendship transcended their Hall of Fame accomplishments. Twyman and Stokes were teammates on the Rochester\/Cincinnati Royals from 1955-58. In the last game of the 1957-58 regular season, Stokes sustained an injury that led to his falling into a coma days later and becoming permanently paralyzed. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic encephalopathy, a brain injury that damaged his motor-control center. Stokes was supported for the rest of his life by Twyman, who became his legal guardian and advocate. Twyman helped organize the NBA\u2019s Maurice Stokes Memorial Basketball Game, which raised funds for Stokes\u2019 medical care and, after Stokes\u2019 death in 1970 at age 36, for other players in need. In 2004, after years of lobbying by Twyman, Stokes was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Twyman, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1983, died in 2012. Below are voting totals for the 2019-20 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award and the list of all-time winners."},{"id":1527,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-jimmy-butler-shooting-good-combination-miami-heat","date":"2020-10-06","title":"Film Study: 5 plays that tell the biggest story of Heat's Game 3 win","content":" Jimmy Butler didn\u2019t attempt a 3-pointer in Game 3 of The Finals on Sunday, becoming the first player in 18 years to score 40 points in a Finals game without a long-range shot. But Butler was surrounded by shooters in the Miami Heat\u2019s 115-104 victory, in which his team scored 87 points on 67 possessions (1.3 per) over the final 33 minutes. With two Miami starters out the last two games, Butler has had additional pick-and-roll duties, while also taking on the high-post, offensive-hub role of Bam Adebayo. On Sunday, he had the ball in his hands for more than half of the 22.3 minutes the Heat had the ball, and he accounted for 73 of the Heat\u2019s 115 points via his own scoring and his 13 assists. Butler assisted on seven of the Heat\u2019s 12 3-pointers, and his passes led to three of the other five. There were the standard, Adebayo-esque, dribble-handoff assists ( here\u2019s one ), and the relationship worked both ways as the attention paid to the Heat\u2019s shooters allowed Butler to get into the paint and to the free throw line. Here are some examples of how Butler and his shooter got good shots in Game 3: Butler\u2019s first two points came off a simple \u201cpistol\u201d action in which Tyler Herro set a screen along the right sideline. Danny Green and LeBron James weren\u2019t on the same page and Butler got to the rim before Anthony Davis could help from the weak side. Midway through the second quarter, the Lakers (Green and Alex Caruso) botched another switch when Butler faked a handoff to Kendrick Nunn, allowing Butler to get into the paint a draw a foul from the recovering Green. Early in the second quarter, the Heat ran their standard sideline out-of-bounds play , with Robinson inbounding the ball to Butler and getting a back-screen from Nunn. The Lakers defended it well until Robinson came out of the corner to take a handoff from Butler. Rajon Rondo got caught behind the play, Green stepped up to stop Robinson, and Kyle Kuzma left Jae Crowder in the weak-side corner to help on Butler\u2019s roll to the rim. Robinson kicked out to Crowder for a wide-open 3. With a little less than four minutes to go in the second quarter, Duncan Robinson got the first of his three 3-pointers when James hesitated to step out on a handoff from Butler. Five possessions later, Butler handed off to Herro and Caruso stayed with him on the roll to the rim. James again gave the shooter some space, but Herro saw the mismatch inside and Butler got one of his easiest buckets of the night. The Lakers erased a 14-point deficit and took a two-point lead early in the fourth quarter. Butler then got a tough, one-on-one bucket against James. On two of the next four Miami possessions, the Lakers had trouble defending the same action (run in opposite directions) where Robinson and Kelly Olynyk set sequential screens for Butler. On the first, both James and Morris followed Butler into the paint, leaving Olynyk alone on the perimeter for a pick-and-pop 3. When the Heat ran the same action the other way, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope switched the first screen and Davis was ready to switch the second. But Olynyk slipped to the basket, Butler threw a deft bounce pass and Davis didn\u2019t react quickly enough. It appears unlikely that Dragic will be back for Game 4 on Tuesday (9 p.m. ET, ABC). Adebayo has been upgraded to questionable, but that\u2019s still two steps away from available. Butler, meanwhile, will have a difficult time replicating the one-on-one scoring success he had in Game 3 as the Heat try to even the series. That doesn\u2019t mean the Heat will be any easier to defend. With Butler\u2019s ability to get into the paint and to the line, along with the shooting he has around him, the Lakers\u2019 defense will continue to be tested. The 120.5 points per 100 possessions the Heat have scored over the last two games is the most the Lakers have allowed over two games in these playoffs and the most the Heat have scored over two games since late February. If they can come close to that mark on Tuesday, this series might get really interesting. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

So it\u2019s been difficult for me mentally because it hurts me that I can\u2019t be out there and help my team.\u201d Dragic, meanwhile, didn\u2019t play in the second half of Game 2 after suffering his injury. Dragic has been able to put pressure on the foot, but the guard said that dealing with the pain is the most significant factor in his potential return. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can do,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cIt does feel better than when it happened. We\u2019ll see. I snapped it, so it\u2019s already bad. I\u2019m dealing with a lot of pain, so that\u2019s the main concern. I don\u2019t want to be a liability on the floor for my team. I want to be the best that I can be.\u201d Adebayo and Dragic have taken on significant roles for Miami throughout the playoffs with the duo averaging 38 points combined. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra pointed out that both have lobbied to play since suffering their respective injuries, but the team wants to make sure it handles their returns properly. Los Angeles captured victories in the first two games to take a 2-0 lead before Jimmy Butler racked up a 40-point triple double in Game 3 to pull Miami within one game in this best-of-seven series. \u201cYou have to compartmentalize as a team,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe came here with a purpose and a task at hand, and everybody is just focusing on that, whoever\u2019s available, until if or when we get those guys back. Even those guys just being in the locker room and in the huddles, that moves the needle in whatever way they can. There is an energy to that. There is a karma to that.

Miami could still possibly play a third consecutive game without two important cogs in Bam Adebayo (neck strain) and Goran Dragic (torn left plantar fascia). >  The Finals, Game 4: Lakers vs. Heat, Tuesday (9 ET, ABC) Both discussed their potential timetables for return as day-to-day. Butler, meanwhile, prefers to play in a situation where he\u2019s not the focal point, where the Heat are sharing the ball offensively and locked in as a unit on defense. \u201cThose,\u201d the veteran swingman said, \u201care the best wins.\u201d Reality might dictate differently, especially if the Heat are forced to play another outing without Adebayo and\/or Dragic. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about what he thinks about that right now,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019re way past that now. There\u2019s no turning back. He has to make some things happen for us. He did that in a brilliant way last night, and he\u2019ll likely have to do something very similar to that again. \u201cFor us to be able to accomplish what we want to accomplish, you just can\u2019t be normal. You have to be extraordinary. He\u2019s shouldering responsibilities on both sides of the floor. This is what he\u2019s always wanted as a competitor. This is what we want for him. He\u2019s going to continue to get tested and challenged by this competition, and I just love seeing what\u2019s coming out of that competition.\u201d It\u2019s taxing, for sure. Butler averages 37.3 minutes in the playoffs, which ranks as his highest postseason time on the floor since 2016-17, when he averaged 39.8 minutes. After playing 33:25 in Miami\u2019s Game 1 loss, he\u2019s upped those totals to 44:45 and 44:51 in the last two games without Dragic and Adebayo to share the load. Butler racked up a usage rate of 32.7% in Game 3, which ranked as just his third-highest mark of this postseason, as NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann detailed . Butler held onto the ball for 11.7 minutes in Game 3 , according to Second Spectrum tracking, dishing seven of his postseason career-high-tying 13 assists on the Heat\u2019s 12 buckets from deep. Butler poured in his game-high 40 points without attempting a single 3-pointer. \u201cIf you just constantly try to evaluate him and put him in a box of conventional thinking of basketball, you\u2019re only going to get confused,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe is an elite competitor. It\u2019s attached to how he impacts winning, not this modern-day definition of 3-point percentage, 3-and-D or all these little terms you hear. He\u2019s a throwback. It\u2019s about how he impacts winning, how he impacts your team, your locker room, your culture, your franchise. He does that in a remarkable way.\u201d But you have to wonder what\u2019s left for Butler to give as this series progresses. He fired up a game-high 20 shots in Game 3, in addition to taking 14 attempts from the foul line, an indication he\u2019s taking some punishment as Miami\u2019s only star carrying the load against a veteran Lakers squad blessed with two superstars in James and Anthony Davis. Butler pointed out that his day on Monday consisted of \u201ca lot of rest, a lot of treatment,\u201d while mentioning that for him, the recovery process is mostly mental. Besides that, Butler constantly hears Spoelstra\u2019s voice in his head telling him he\u2019s just fine. According to Elias Sports Bureau, the 73 points Butler created from scoring and assists in Game 3 ranked as the second-highest total in Finals history behind Walt Frazier\u2019s 74 in 1970 with the New York Knicks. \u201cAll I can hear is Spo over and over again telling me how I\u2019m not tired,\u201d Butler said. \u201cSo, going into it, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t be tired, you can\u2019t be banged up. These guys need you. They\u2019re counting on you. If they see you, that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to be. \u201cSo, to the best of my ability, I\u2019m working on my body. I go in [the training room] this morning, I see Tyler [Herro] in there, I see Duncan [Robinson] in there, I see everybody in there. So I know they\u2019re feeling the same way I am. But they\u2019re getting ready to go again.\u201d The Lakers are too, especially after watching film of a Game 3 they believe slipped away due to turnovers (20 for 21 Heat points) and miscommunications on defense. \u201cCredit the Miami Heat,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe were careless in some situations, but I think they took four charges throughout the game, they fronted the post, forced us to make difficult post-entry passes. So, a lot of it was their defense, them being active with their hands. This is what they\u2019re great at, and we didn\u2019t handle it well enough.\u201d James assured those will mistakes be cleaned up in Game 4, while Davis praised the NBA\u2019s quick turnaround between games, saying he\u2019ll be ready to bounce back from his subpar performance. \u201cI\u2019m excited we get to play tomorrow night, to go back and help my team try to go up 3-1,\u201d Davis said. As for Butler, he\u2019ll work his hardest to prevent that as Miami looks to even the series at 2-2. After Game 4, the teams won\u2019t meet again until Friday for Game 5, which gives both squads plenty of recovery time for the nicks and bruises. But make no mistake, the game face remains on at all times for Butler. So as expected, he declined to offer any celebratory sales prices at his Big Face Coffee in the aftermath of Miami\u2019s first victory of the series. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything the exact same, like we\u2019re supposed to do on the basketball floor,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI always say, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m gonna make it to the NBA Finals. I want to play in the NBA Finals. I want to win a championship.\u2019 That time for me is now.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

I\u2019ve got my full range of motion. For three years, I was trying to play the best players in the world on one leg. I needed help from my kids to put my socks on in the morning. \u201cNow, I can lift weights. I can squat low. I can work out twice a day. I\u2019m able to cut and move and stop, able to cut and go. I feel like I\u2019m 31 years old again. And now, I have scientific evidence to show that.\u201d Thomas averaged 12.2 points and 3.7 assists in 40 games for the Wizards this season. The 30-year-old guard has played for seven NBA teams since being drafted out of Washington in 2011. He was traded from the Wizards to the LA Clippers in the Marcus Morris trade that involved the Knicks, but Thomas was waived by the Clippers two days after they acquired him. After being waived by the Clippers, Thomas decided something had to change with his hip, Wojnarowski reports. Thomas then saw Dr. Edwin Su in New York, who performed the resurfacing procedure on the guard. He was fitted with a unique type of artificial joint to account for the fact that Thomas, 31, is different from the typical patient. \u201cThe goal was to give him a smooth joint surface so he doesn\u2019t feel pain and has better mobility,\u201d Su said. \u201cWe have more confidence for athletes like Isaiah to back to full activity.\u201d In his career, Thomas averaged 18.1 points and 5.0 assists and was an All-Star in 2015-16 and 2016-17 with the Boston Celtics. He made the All-NBA second team in 2016-17 and finished fifth in Kia MVP voting that season, too. His injury problems began that season and Thomas attempted to push through the injury during the 2017 Eastern Conference finals. After Boston fell into a 2-0 series hole to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Thomas was shut down before Game 3. He was then dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Kyrie Irving trade and did not make his debut until New Year\u2019s Day 2018. A little more than a month later he was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers with Channing Frye for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. Since then, Thomas has played for the Denver Nuggets in 2018-19 and Wizards last season, signing with both as a free agent. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":1741,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-cares-community-assist-award-2019-20-official-release","date":"2020-10-05","title":"Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, George Hill, Chris Paul and Dwight Powell named recipients of 2019-20 NBA Cares Community Assist Award presented by Kaiser Permanente","content":" NEW YORK  \u2013 Sacramento Kings forward Harrison Barnes, Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, Milwaukee Bucks guard George Hill, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul and Dallas Mavericks forward-center Dwight Powell have received the 2019-20 End-of-Season NBA Cares Community Assist Award presented by Kaiser Permanente in recognition of their continued commitment to positively impacting their communities through sustained efforts over the course of the season, the NBA announced today. This year\u2019s end-of-season award recognizes five players whose exemplary work advanced social justice and provided COVID-19 relief and support, reflecting the longstanding passion of NBA players to give back to their communities and stand up for the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion. The five recipients made concerted efforts throughout the 2019-20 season \u2013 which extended nearly a full calendar year including the league\u2019s hiatus and restart \u2013 to leverage their platforms and voices to engage, empower and support different communities amidst the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic and social justice movement following continued incidents of racialized violence against Black men and women. Each winning player will receive $10,000 to their charity of choice, a donation from the NBA and Kaiser Permanente.  Harrison Barnes, Sacramento Kings  Barnes has provided meaningful support to youth, families and frontline workers in Sacramento, Dallas and Ames, IA. Barnes and his wife, Brittany, donated $40,000 to deliver weekly groceries for families and senior citizens in Sacramento and contributed an additional $40,000 to Hunger Busters, a local non-profit that provides daily meals for Dallas Independent School District students, and $10,000 to the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Dallas. Barnes provided nearly $200,000 for refurbishments to his alma mater Ames High School to assist with safe and healthy learning. He continues to take a leadership role in fighting for meaningful change to combat racial and social inequities, speaking about the importance of civic engagement and voting at a peaceful protest in downtown Sacramento in support of Black Lives Matter following the tragic murder of George Floyd. As part of the season restart, Barnes dedicated each Kings game to a different organization, including the Trayvon Martin Foundation, The Botham Jean Foundation, The Atatiana Project, Mothers Against Police Brutality, The Michael Brown Foundation, Tamir Rice Foundation, Champion in the Making and the African American Policy Forum, contributing $25,000 to each non-profit created by the families of victims of police brutality and gun violence. Barnes has selected the African American Policy Forum as the recipient of his donation. \u201cIt is a great honor to be named among the winners of the NBA Community Assist Award, which I proudly share with my wife, Brittany,\u201d said Barnes. \u201cBrittany and I remain committed to helping the communities we are connected to, specifically showing our support for families affected by police brutality. We dedicate this award to the legacy of Breonna Taylor and we stand with organizations such as #SayHerName with African American Policy Forum to shine a light on Black women and girls who have been victims of police brutality. We cannot forget them, and the Black men senselessly killed. Our efforts are not done, and we will continue to make a difference to fuel racial and social justice.\u201d Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  Brown has continuously demonstrated leadership in Boston and Atlanta and throughout the hiatus and restart, organizing action and advocating for racial and educational equity. Following the killing of George Floyd, Brown drove 15 hours to his native Atlanta and organized a peaceful march on May 30. Brown\u2019s impassioned advocacy towards social justice inspired the Boston Celtics United for Social Justice campaign, a multi-focus commitment to addressing racial injustice and social inequities in the greater Boston area. In response to the pandemic, Brown made a significant contribution to the Boston Resiliency Fund, a city-led effort to assist communities most impacted by the pandemic. His generous donation provided meals for senior citizens and families most in need, new technology for students as they transitioned to remote learning as well as continued support for first responders. Brown has selected the 7uice Foundation as the recipient of his donation. On receiving the 2019-20 End-of-Season NBA Cares Community Assist Award presented by Kaiser Permanente, Brown shared, \u201cThere is so much more work to be done.\u201d George Hill, Milwaukee Bucks  Hill and his teammates were instrumental in encouraging members of the NBA family to leverage their collective platforms to advance social justice. Electing not to play on Aug. 26, Hill and the Bucks organized a call with Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes to discuss meaningful measures to address criminal justice reform. In April, he partnered with Represent Justice for a conversation with Xavier McElrath-Bey, who was formerly incarcerated, about the criminal justice system following the Bucks\u2019 Play for Justice game at Racine Correctional Institution in December. Particularly focused on education, Hill collaborated with community leaders in his hometown of Indianapolis to open Him By Her Collegiate School for the Arts, preparing underserved students for college entry and postgraduate success, and created a youth mentorship program to help Milwaukee Public School students stay engaged during the pandemic called George\u2019s Gentlemen. To support those impacted by COVID-19, Hill donated meals to health care workers and contributed to the Bucks Emergency Relief Fund to provide financial relief to Fiserv Forum employees. Hill has selected Represent Justice as the recipient of his donation. \u201cEvery day we have to live our lives with greater respect and purpose. This isn\u2019t a one-person battle, it\u2019s a battle for the entire world,\u201d Hill said. \u201cNow is the time for us to come together as one and embrace each other, love one another and grow together. Humanity is something we\u2019re lacking, and I will continue to do my job to bring back those attributes that we lack today in every community.\u201d Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder  As President of the National Basketball Players Association, Paul played an integral role in ensuring the goal of the season restart would be to take collective action to combat systemic racism and promote social justice, working in partnership with the NBPA and NBA to create social justice messages on jerseys and the court, provide on campus programs and resources for players and use the game\u2019s platform to increase awareness around civic engagement. Paul, Portland\u2019s Carmelo Anthony and NBA legend Dwyane Wade launched the Social Change Fund in July dedicated to addressing social and economic justice issues facing Black communities and breaking down the discriminatory barriers to success. In March, he collaborated with Live Nation to launch an internship program at North Carolina A&T State University, providing students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities with an opportunity to gain experience in the music industry. As part of the Chris Paul Family Foundation\u2019s efforts to strengthen communities, Paul donated meals to feed more than 200 hospital workers in North Carolina during the pandemic. Paul\u2019s foundation also partnered with State Farm and Spalding in January to renovate a 30-year-old court at Family T.R.E.E, an organization dedicated to renewing and reunifying families in Oklahoma City, and hosted 100 children from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Oklahoma on a holiday shopping spree, teaching children how to budget their money and give during the holidays. Paul has selected the Chris Paul Family Foundation as the recipient of his donation. \u201cThe community assist award is such an honor to me any year, but this year in particular,\u201d said Paul. \u201cGiven everything 2020 has thrown our way, it\u2019s important that we the players continue to use our NBA platform to be the voice of the voiceless. I will continue to amplify and support the front-line organizations fighting for racial and economic justice as well as the tireless efforts of the health care workers keeping us healthy and safe during the COVID-19 health crisis. I am so thankful for this acknowledgement as it is one of the proudest accolades an NBA player can receive.\u201d Dwight Powell, Dallas Mavericks  During the pandemic, Powell organized immediate support for families and frontline workers in Dallas. He joined teammate Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Mavericks governor Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks Foundation in donating $500,000 to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Hospital to assist with childcare for frontline workers and provide meals from local restaurants for more than 11,000 health care workers and first responders at the City of Dallas\u2019 Emergency Operations Center, COVID-19 testing sites and local hospitals. Powell also lifted the spirits of youth during periods of physical distancing, participating in children\u2019s hospital virtual room visits, delivering congratulatory messages for 2020 graduates, and making personal phone calls and videos encouraging positivity. He continues to support cancer patients and their families through the Dwight Powell Children and Family Support Fund and as part of NBA restart, orchestrated the entire Mavericks roster to select \u201cEquality\u201d to wear on their jerseys. Powell has selected Champions of Discovery as the recipient of his donation. \u201cIn my opinion, being a member of a community means lending your neighbor a hand whenever needed and searching for ways to help make your community a better place for all who live there,\u201d Powell stated. \u201cFurthermore, this year has presented us all with challenges that I feel should have reminded us that we are part of a much larger community than our NBA market. The issues at hand regarding public health and equality are far reaching and demand all of our attention. So it goes without saying we as NBA players have felt the need to step up in whatever way we can to try and find ways to help keep people safe, fight for racial justice and urge everyone to register to vote so they too can use their voices. As members of the greater community I feel that\u2019s all of our duties.\u201d The NBA Cares Community Assist Award presented by Kaiser Permanente recognizes an NBA player each month who best reflects the passion that the league and its players share for giving back to their communities, and honors the standard set by NBA Legend David Robinson, who improved the community piece by piece.  The monthly award recipients in the 2019-20 NBA season included Gorgui Dieng of the Memphis Grizzlies, Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns, DeAndre Jordan of the Brooklyn Nets, Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks and Langston Galloway of the Detroit Pistons.

The Miami Heat\u2019s supremely confident All-Star wing authored one of the best performances in Finals history \u2014 40 points, 11 rebounds, 13 assists, 14-of-20 shooting \u2014 and his team needed nearly every bit of it to stave off the dreaded 0-3 plight. (The NBA should maybe consider a \u201cslaughter rule\u201d of declaring a winner in any best-of-seven series that starts out 3-0, since nobody, ever, has survived that. But we digress.) What must the Chicago Bulls, Minnesota Timberwolves and Philadelphia 76ers be thinking today? None of those three was willing to flip the reins on the court or in the locker room to Butler. The Bulls never really got past drafting Butler with the last pick of the first round in 2011, not when No. 1 Derrick Rose was around, not when they brought in creaky Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo to surround him in 2016. In Minnesota, Butler couldn\u2019t accept being a tutor to Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, not with their spotty efforts, inconsistency and fatter paychecks. So Wolves management freaked when Butler went unprofessional and quit on their team. With Philadelphia, Butler was destined for third option status again behind Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. He channeled his dislike by upping his brashness, unnerving coach Brett Brown, reportedly chafing with Simmons (another underperforming \u201csavior\u201d) and making Tobias Harris look like the more appropriate No. 3. Funny how things change. The decision-makers in Chicago and Minnesota are gone, Brown is gone too, all three teams are poking at reset buttons \u2026 and Butler is the talk of the NBA for being and doing exactly what those teams didn\u2019t trust (or pay) him to do. So how to assess Butler? On paper, he still doesn\u2019t merit the \u201csuperstar\u201d label. He never has finished higher than All-NBA third team, he doesn\u2019t finish near the top in most statistical categories and even his five All-Star selections got a stain when he begged out of the 2018 game too late to replace him with someone eager to play. But Butler and the Heat fit each other. He\u2019s the unquestioned leader, he gets the ball when he wants it and nobody on the roster makes within $12 million of his $32.7 million. In Game 3, Butler became the first player (foe or teammate) to have more points, rebounds and assists in a Finals game in which LeBron James also played. He scored or assisted on 73 of Miami\u2019s points, tied for second-most in a Finals game (Knicks Hall of Famer Walt Frazier had 74 in Game 7, 1970). And when Butler said he hoped he goes scoreless in a Game 4 victory just to show how little personal stats mean to him, he sounded sincere. \u201cI\u2019m glad my teammates got a lot of trust and faith in me to go out there and hoop like that,\u201d said Butler, who figures to see more traps and double-teams in Game 4. \u201cBut like I always say, you guarantee me a win, I could care less.\u201d Still, Butler joined James (2015) and The Logo Jerry West (1969) as the only players to post 40-point triple-doubles in a Finals game. And only one of those three did it while winning the game. The Bulls, Wolves and Sixers can take solace, though, in shedding such a disruptor. Through the first two games at least, and driven somewhat by boredom, a debate raged over which of the Lakers\u2019 two superstars would take home the Bill Russell Finals MVP trophy once the confetti stopped falling. From that tie for first place, Davis now ranks third with Game 3 in the books. After averaging 33 points and 11.5 rebounds while posting a plus-36 rating in L.A.\u2019s two victories, Davis went belly-up Sunday. He scored 15 points, grabbed five rebounds and was a minus-26. (For comparison, James was minus-4 and the Lakers\u2019 bench guys \u2014 even J.R. Smith \u2014 were in the black.) Yes, Davis got in early foul trouble, not all of them worth the predicament they caused. But his stats weren\u2019t down because he got and stayed yanked \u2014 he still played 33 minutes. Coach Frank Vogel was hoping his talented big man could find some rhythm in spite of the fouls, but what he got instead was a passive performance. \u201cIt takes away the aggressiveness on both ends of the floor that I\u2019m used to playing with,\u201d Davis said, \u201cand those guys like to take charges or whatever, and you know, try to draw offensive fouls.\u201d Miami outscored the Lakers in the paint, 52-34. Davis\u2019 team shot more 3-pointers (42) than 2-pointers (37). Neither are ingredients in the West champs\u2019 winning formula. Davis\u2019 tendencies when playing in foul trouble are worth eyeballing, too. In 31 playoff games, he has had four fouls 13 times. He never has had five, however, nor has he fouled out. That says something about how forcefully he plays with four. Then again, in the first 12 games with four, Davis still averaged 29.8 points and 10.9 rebounds, while getting up 19.8 shots. He only attempted nine field goals in Game 3, with his points and rebounds cut in half. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter how high James climbs on the many all-time lists he\u2019s scaling, like playoff assists or Finals blocks or whatever. People will still find ways to criticize him for something, mostly because he gives them something to criticize. On rare occasion, it will be something legitimately basketball, like the eight turnovers he had Sunday, part of the Lakers\u2019 miserable 20 (worth 21 points and jacked-up confidence to the Heat). More often, though, it will be something to do with attitude, comments or behavior that rankle even folks who admire James the player and have him at or near the top of their GOAT assessments. Walking off the court with 10 seconds left in a game your team is about to lose is precisely one of those moments.  James said later he was both frustrated and he lost track of the game circumstances when he bailed. The shot clock forced one last Lakers possession in spite of the margin, with Danny Green having to scramble in from the bench to cover for James. Alex Caruso and Jared Dudley had to do likewise for Rondo and Kyle Kuzma, who also wandered off. This was a bad look for which James immediately got slapped on social media. OK, it wasn\u2019t the Detroit Pistons exiting in the waning moments of the 1991 East finals without shaking Michael Jordan\u2019s hand. Still, it came across as dismissive, as pouty as the lazy shots James sometimes hoists once things aren\u2019t going the Lakers\u2019 way. It\u2019s hard being human when you\u2019re a self-proclaimed king, but that\u2019s what the money is for. No one is asking LeBron James at age 35 to play 48 minutes, but he really ought to stick around for the full 48. The comic relief moment of Game 3 came late, when Miami rookie Tyler Herro drove past Rondo for a layup and a foul that put the Heat in front 112-102. The sideline camera caught Herro walking back after that play with a curled lip that had social media jockeys likening him to 1980s punk rocker Billy Idol. Maybe even vintage Elvis. Let\u2019s not forget that earlier in the game, Herro had an \u201cexcuse me, pardon me\u201d moment trying to squeeze past Lakers strongman Markieff Morris, who gave him some chest, a look and some words, lest the slender Herro forget with whom he was dealing. That Herro could go there , his team sitting atop a safe lead by then, made the lip curl funnier. One way to look at Herro\u2019s transformation from bullied rookie to sneering winner, all in a matter of an hour or so, was as the embodiment of what the Heat do late in games. In the first three quarters of their 18 playoff games, the Heat\u2019s scoring margins are -0.9 points, 0.6 points and -1.1 points. In the fourth? They outscore their foes by an average of 4.6. That was Herro Sunday. From 3-of-13 for nine points through three quarters to 3-of-5 for eight points in the fourth. That earned him his curled lip. It\u2019s too early to know, and the Heat decision-makers surely aren\u2019t sharing yet, whether center Bam Adebayo or point guard Goran Dragic will play in Games 4 or 5. Both essential Miami players have missed the past two games, Adebayo with a neck\/shoulder strain and Dragic with a torn plantar fascia in his left foot. But winning even one game in the series buys both players time for treatment and a possible return. If one or both returns for Game 4 Tuesday, he will have had six days since suffering or irritating their injuries in the opener. By Game 5 Friday, it will be eight days. Neither Adebayo, who is said to be closer, nor Dragic, whose injury is more debilitating, likely would be 100 percent. But even in spurts, they could make the Heat and the Lakers feel as if Miami\u2019s cavalry had arrived. Remember, Willis Reed only took five shots and made two in his fabled Game 7 return for the Knicks in 1970, but it etched his name into NBA annals. So the Lakers didn\u2019t just keep everybody in the bubble for an extra three days with their inability to sweep this series. They gave the Heat life, and hope. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Sometimes, it\u2019s a candy bar or sandwich or another product named after them, or maybe a mention in a hit song, or most commonly, a game. Not a game that\u2019s compatible with Playstation. Like, a real game. Well: Jimmy Butler just had a game. On Oct. 4 in the very complicated year of 2020, inside a shoebox of an arena on the Walt Disney World grounds, when everyone tuned in expecting more of the same in the lopsided Finals, the Jimmy Butler Game happened. That\u2019s what it\u2019ll be known for, because it was real and it was spectacular. For all but two minutes and 14 seconds of Game 3 , the Lakers felt and the Heat enjoyed the total Jimmy Butler Experience. There was energy from him, chilly composure, plenty of buckets of course, leadership and then a sly and sinister message near the end of his masterpiece when he snarly returned a taunt that LeBron James gave him in the first quarter: \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble.\u201d > Finals Game 4: Tuesday, 9 p.m. ET on ABC Not sure if LeBron heard it, or if the Lakers even believe it, but that\u2019s really beside the point. Common sense says the Lakers will or should eventually own this series in which they still lead 2-1 , but Sunday, if he does nothing else from here, Butler took ownership of His Game. With a pair of important starters missing their second straight game for the Heat, Butler basically replayed a sequel to his famous Timberwolves moment when he took the Minnesota scrubs and beat the starters in practice to demonstrate his desire and toughness. From a statistical standpoint, Butler was never known as a volume guy in his career, or ever classified as a superstar by the strictest of definitions, but this was a dire situation facing Miami and so Butler put the \u201cball\u201d in ballistic on Sunday. These types of performances, meaning his 40-point triple-double , are rightly described as legendary when they happen in the championship round. Butler upped that ante by doing it without Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic, and with his short-handed team down 2-0 in the series, and becoming the first player to outscore, out-rebound and out-assist LeBron in a Finals game \u2014 while also guarding LeBron. \u201cWe won,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI could care less about triple-doubles. Glad my teammates had faith in me to hoop like that. I care about the win.\u201d Yes, indeed. Meanwhile, the tally: 40 points, 13 assists, 11 rebounds, two blocks and two steals for the 115-104 win. His points matched the combined output of LeBron and Anthony Davis, the leading candidates for Finals MVP. \u201cI\u2019m ready for this,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThis is the biggest stage.\u201d He certainly made a fan of LeBron, who called Butler \u201cone of the best competitors we have in this game.\u201d Perhaps most impressive is how Butler was so efficient. He took only 20 shots, just two more than teammate Tyler Herro, yet Butler made 14 by employing some old-school flavor. He commanded attention and respect. He scored off the bounce, isolated by backing his man in the paint, drew enough contact to take 14 free throws (making 12), stuff you rarely see in a league that\u2019s heavily slanted to a 3-point-shot-or-layup mentality. Butler didn\u2019t even attempt a three in 45 minutes. Also, he involved his teammates by drawing double-teams and creating shots for them, which of course only endeared him even more in the Miami locker room. \u201cWe know how Jimmy is in these moments,\u201d Herro said. \u201cHe did everything obviously, made play after play, bucket after bucket, defensively guarding LeBron, just being a leader out there, and we\u2019re all following him. He just wants to win. He knows what it takes to win.\u201d Butler was a curious choice, at least from an outsider\u2019s point of view, for Miami when the club went hunting for a centerpiece last summer and Butler was a free agent. Butler\u2019s previous stints in Chicago, Minnesota and Philadelphia were not all ice cream and sweetness. He rubbed some the wrong way \u2014 all in the name of competitiveness, he insists. Teammates weren\u2019t broken up to see him leave. And Butler, though a five-time All-Star, has only made one All-NBA Team (third) and isn\u2019t blessed with otherworldly physical gifts or Unicorn-like skills. But Miami sensed what basketball purists knew: Butler is a competitive savant. Dwyane Wade, the best player in franchise history, sold Butler on Miami (\u201cthis is your guy, this is the next guy\u201d he told Heat coach Erik Spoelstra) and vice versa. And here, in their first season together, they\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of a somewhat unexpected ride for the player and No. 5 seed team. \u201cThis is why we pursued Jimmy very aggressively,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe were able to build a culture and surround a team around him. He\u2019s an elite top percentile competitor.\u201d You must understand the pickle that Miami found itself in Sunday. Adebayo is nursing a bum shoulder and Dragic has a faulty plantar issue, and that erased a needed defender and a scorer from the lineup. Plus, LeBron and Davis did tag-team a number on Miami the first two games. Finally: No team has rallied from 3-0 in any NBA playoff series. Losing Game 3 meant Miami could start packing bags. But Game 3 presented Butler with a challenge and a chance to show the basketball universe what he brings to the conversation. \u201cThis is what he wanted, what we wanted,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to analyze and describe Jimmy until you feel him between the four lines. We needed it. He was doing it on both ends, putting his imprint on every part of the game. He got stronger as the game went on.\u201d Yes, Butler never wilted from the moment or the urgency or pressure or burden. He kept asking for the ball and the chance to be a savior and the opportunity to extend this series beyond Tuesday. Butler wasn\u2019t letting LeBron or Davis or anyone steal this night from him or remove his name from this game. \u201cIt\u2019s so settling to have that type of guy in a very competitive game like this,\u201d said Spoelstra. Meanwhile, the Lakers proved they are not immune to the occasional stinker, and they definitely left a scent. Davis fought through fouls in the first three quarters yet turned meek in the fourth. His impact was a quiet 15 points and five rebounds. LeBron once again flirted with a triple-double but at no point was he superior to Butler. Other than flashes from Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris, the Lakers were mild. \u201cThis was our game and we let our foot off the gas,\u201d said Kuzma. Uh, actually, this was never your game. This game was already taken. LeBron added: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re concerned. We\u2019re not concerned. We know we can play a whole lot better.\u201d This much is true, and maybe Butler was sounding more hopeful than anything else when he got puffy-chested following the win and began to gloat. \u201cLeBron has gotten the best of me way too many times,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut this is a different time now, different group of guys around me. We\u2019re not going to lay down. We\u2019re going to fight back into this and get to 2-2.\u201d In a best-case scenario for the Heat, they\u2019ll get at least one missing player back in uniform Tuesday for Game 4 \u2014 most likely Adebayo \u2014 and surf this feel-good moment for at least another night. Understand that when a series is extended, that\u2019s one more game for something to go terribly wrong for the heavily-favored. That, more than the Heat, is the biggest issue confronting the Lakers. But that\u2019s for another day. For today, and until the ball goes up again in this series, it\u2019s His World, or more specifically, His Game. If you didn\u2019t know his name before Sunday, now you know. \u201cJimmy Effin\u2019 Butler,\u201d Spoelstra said, with emphasis on the middle. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Playing without Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo for a second straight game, the Heat rode Jimmy Butler down the stretch after blowing a 14-point lead. The Lakers led by two with a little less than nine minutes to go, but the Heat outscored them 26-13 over the final 8:31 , with Butler scoring or assisting on 21 of those 26 points. Butler became just the third player in Finals history (joining LeBron James and Jerry West) to record a 40-point triple-double, finishing with 40, 11 rebounds and 13 assists. One stat stood out from the rest as the Heat made this a 2-1 series with Game 4 on Tuesday (9 p.m. ET, ABC) . 11.7 \u2014 Minutes for which Jimmy Butler had the ball in Game 3, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That\u2019s more than double Butler\u2019s average time of possession ( 5.6 minutes per game ) in the playoffs prior to Sunday. Butler\u2019s usage rate of 32.7% was only his third-highest mark of these playoffs. But usage rate is just the percentage of a team\u2019s possessions (while he\u2019s on the floor) that a player ends with a field goal attempt, free throw attempt, or turnover. The time of possession really tells you how much Butler controlled a Miami offense that had the fourth-most efficient game against the Lakers in these playoffs. Without Dragic and Adebayo in Game 2, Butler led both teams in time of possession at 8.6 minutes . In Game 3, he had the ball 35% more, once again on the floor for all but three minutes of game time. It was similar to LeBron James in the 2015 Finals after the Cavs lost Kyrie Irving to a knee injury. Butler assisted on seven of the Heat\u2019s 12 3-pointers, but his own scoring was all inside the arc. In fact, he became the first player to score 40 points in a Finals game without a 3-point attempt since Shaquille O\u2019Neal did it five times in the Lakers\u2019 three-peat from 2000-02. He was just 1-for-4 from mid-range, but Butler\u2019s 26 points in the paint were six more than James (16) and Anthony Davis (4) combined, as well as four more than Butler had ever scored in a game before (654 career games). He\u2019d only scored 20-plus points in the paint three times prior. Butler was 4-for-5 in the restricted area and 9-for-11 elsewhere in the paint , with those nine non-restricted-area paint buckets being more than the Heat had as a team in the first two games combined ( seven ). Butler added 12 free throws on 14 attempts. He\u2019s now averaged 68 free throw attempts per 100 shots from the field in the playoffs. That\u2019s the fourth highest rate (lower than only those of three centers) among 95 players with at least 50 field goal attempts in the postseason. He\u2019s attempted a postseason-high 169 free throws, nine more than Davis , who has 62 more field goal attempts. Butler rested just 55 seconds in the second half and guarding James for most of it, but he still had enough gas in the tank to lead the Heat to their second most efficient quarter of the series with their season basically on the line. Before taking a 24-second violation on their final possession, the Heat scored 30 points on just 22 possessions in the game-deciding fourth quarter. The Heat are still alive, they just had their best defensive game of the series, and by extending the series, they\u2019ve increased the likelihood that they\u2019ll get Dragic and\/or Adebayo back to help Butler carry the load. For one night, at least, he did just fine carrying it himself.

That\u2019s what was supposed to be on the line Sunday night in the bubble with the Lakers poised to take a commanding 3-0 lead over the Miami Heat in The Finals. Or at least that was the narrative going into the game. > Finals Game 4: Tuesday, 9 p.m. ET on ABC The conversation went from could they or would they, and when they\u2019re done, where do they fit all time, and are they the next generation Shaq and Kobe? I think it\u2019s a bit premature to put this partnership on that level after just one Finals appearance. And, apparently, so did Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler. We\u2019ve got a series folks! And as Butler made clear at the end of the night \u2026 * * * 24 \u2014 No idea what Lakers team is is on the floor to start the game. No clue! The Heat with an early 22-9 lead (courtesy of nine early Lakers \u2019turnovers). 23 \u2014 I love the Heat coming out with the requisite fire to make this game more interesting than the previous two. Didn\u2019t expect any retreat from them \u2014 not with Udonis Haslem breathing. No lead is safe, of course. But they\u2019ve tried playing from behind already in this series. Might as well try and push it for as long as they can. 22 \u2014 It was sweet while it lasted. Kyle Kuzma\u2019s crier 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer cut Miami\u2019s lead to just three (26-23). The Lakers snoozed early and their 10 turnovers (resulting in 11 points for the Heat) should have been a back-breaker and probably would have been \u2026 anywhere but in the bubble. The normal rules (to just about everything) do not apply here! 21 \u2014 Kuzma\u2019s not done. A quick nine points off the bench for him to spark the Lakers. The belief in Kuzma by the Lakers is paying off nicely in this series. He hadn\u2019t really had a breakout stretch since the restart, so his timing right now is perfect. And I still think he\u2019s the ideal solution for the Lakers\u2019 third scorer (6-foot-10 scorers with 3-point range tend to come in handy in the NBA). 20 \u2014 The patience AD shows with how the Lakers operate on offense goes against everything we\u2019ve come to believe about superstar players in this league. And it\u2019s one of the best things about his game, if you ask me. The man never seems to stress his touches. Just stays in the flow. 19 \u2014 While the rest of the world is focused on the Lakers, Jimmy Butler continues rocking to his own beat. Heat up 42-37 behind Butler\u2019s 15 points (6-for-8 shooting), five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Meanwhile AD\u2019s in foul trouble and LeBron still can\u2019t catch a rhythm. With so little margin for error, Butler\u2019s going to need some serious support tonight. Anyone out there? 18 \u2014 Butler is out here playing his guts out trying to keep the Heat in this series \u2026 and LeBron is just casually picking the Heat apart (with AD on the bench in foul trouble). He\u2019s keeping the Lakers within a basket or two as the first half winds down. Heat up 58-54 at halftime, but there\u2019s nothing severe about this cushion. 17 \u2014 Instead of clowning Earl Smith (no relation, that I know of) in The Finals, we choose to celebrate the man, the myth and the legend that is J.R. Smith for doing what he does \u2026 16 \u2014 Give it up one more time for Jimmy Butler! Showing up and showing out with the Heat\u2019s season the line. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be enough to save them or not. But the effort is there. 15 \u2014 AD with his fourth foul. Heat cranking up from deep. A 66-54 lead with 9:17 to play feels like a movement, like momentum. Folks were busy writing the Heat off the past few days. But they\u2019re showing the fight you\u2019d expect from a team that went through the Eastern Conference playoff field the way they did. We know they are resilient and have the ingredients (save for good health) needed to turn this into a series. Now we\u2019re going to see if the Lakers have what it takes to bounce back and snatch that momentum away. This is The Finals drama I love. 14 \u2014 The Lakers\u2019 starting backcourt went scoreless until the 7:36 mark of the third quarter (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope finally hit a 3-pointer). Whew. Ugly stuff until then from the first five as a unit. 13 \u2014 Butler on triple-double alert (25-8-8) with 5 minutes to play in the third and the Heat clinging to the lead. His performance is D-Wade approved, btw \u2026 \u2026 and Kevin Love, too! 12 \u2014 This seems like a \u201cPlayoff Rondo\u201d special! (I know he hates the nickname, but it is good.) 11 \u2014 I agree with Draymond: We could have this conversation about several players who showed up for their teams at the most important time of 2019-20. There\u2019s Denver\u2019s Jerami Grant, Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart and \u2026 sorry, back to Game 3. 10 \u2014 Best player on the floor though three quarters tonight? Hands down, it\u2019s Jimmy Butler! 9 \u2014 So, who closes strongest? 8 \u2014 Lakers bench rises up. Markieff Morris\u2019 3-pointers. Rajon Rondo\u2019s activity and attacking mentality. Lakers go up 91-89 with 8:55 to play. This shaping up as a potential roster win, and a critical one it will be if they finish. The vets smell the opportunity. You can sense it in the way they are playing right now. 7 \u2014 This is basically what we always ask for this time of year. #BestonBest 6 \u2014 I can see this \u2026 sort of. 5 \u2014 LeBron is doing LeBron things, as usual. Butler is putting on an absolute show, carrying the Heat in every way imaginable. One of the great free-agent signings in recent NBA history. 4 \u2014 Something tells me Jimmy doesn\u2019t really care. 3 \u2014 How about 45 minutes, 40 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for Jimmy F. Buckets. An absolute masterpiece to put the Heat on the map in this series. Not a stunner, by any stretch as we know he\u2019s more than capable of this. But it was an absolute masterpiece of a performance. 2 \u2014 We\u2019ve got a series. Any chance Bam Adebayo comes back by Tuesday? Will his shoulder be better by Friday\u2019s Game 5? Just talking out loud here as the entire series shifts into a completely different mode after this effort from Butler, Kelly Olynyk (17 off the bench after his 24 in Game 2), Tyler Herro (17), Duncan Robinson (13) and Jae Crowder (12). You had to know these guys weren\u2019t about to go out and get swept. 1 \u2014 It was his night, folks! Game 4 on Tuesday night becomes a colossal affair given the two-day break between Game 4 and Friday\u2019s Game 5. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

And Butler delivered. Again and again. By the time the final ticks flipped off the game clock, Butler had racked up 40 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists \u2014 just the third 40-point triple-double in Finals history. He joins Jerry West (1969) and LeBron James (2015) as the only players to do so. Butler shot 14-for-20 (70%) and 12-for-14 (85.7%) from the line, also contributing two blocks and two steals. His mark from the paint (outside the restricted area) was a particularly impressive 9-for-11 (81.8%), well above the league average of 40.1%. That he scored 40 without attempting a 3 marked the first time that had happened since Shaquille O\u2019Neal did so in 2002, the fifth time O\u2019Neal had achieved the feat. Including the assists, Butler accounted for 73 of the Heat\u2019s 115 points \u2014 per Elias Sports Bureau, the second-highest mark in Finals history, trailing only Walt Frazier (74). The performance earned plaudits across the aisle, as Butler became the first player (opponent OR teammate) to out-score\/-assist\/-rebound LeBron James in a Finals game. The Lakers star, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, offered high praise: \u201cJimmy was phenomenal,\u201d James said. \u201cHe did everything they needed for him to do tonight.

For the first time in the league\u2019s history, the initials of an individual will be featured prominently on the chest of an official NBA game uniform. The Hawks will be donating profits from the jersey sales back into the Atlanta community to help further initiatives championed by Dr. King. Born and raised in Atlanta, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., became a global symbol of the fight for racial equality through his platform of non-violence. He attended his hometown\u2019s historic Morehouse College, entering as a freshman when he was just 15 years old. While he continued to call Atlanta home, raising his family and pastoring at local churches like Ebenezer Baptist with his father, Dr. King led initiatives that caught the attention of a worldwide audience, including the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the March on Washington. The latter is where he made his watershed \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, playing a significant role in his being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. His life and leadership were cut short at age of 39 by an assassin, as he organized for the rights of sanitation workers in Memphis.  \u201cIt is an incredible privilege to be able to represent the legacy of Dr. King, one of Atlanta\u2019s native sons and one of the nation\u2019s most transformative leaders. His message of equality, non-violence, and justice is as relevant today as it was in the 60s and we are proud to not only help educate legions of young fans about Dr. King\u2019s work, but empower them to pick up his mantle and embody the change they wish to see in their communities,\u201d said Hawks Chief Marketing Officer, Melissa Proctor. \u201cWe are honored that the King Estate would entrust us with these powerful initials.\u201d Deeply connected to the tenets of Dr. King\u2019s social activism are the roots from which the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 own civic work grows. The team has a well-demonstrated commitment to building bridges through basketball to help better the community. The Hawks\u2019 ongoing efforts in addressing food insecurity, access to early voting, and entrepreneurial development are directly tied to crucial issues on which Dr. King focused, including racial equality, voting rights, and economic justice. In a franchise first, profits from the sale of the groundbreaking jersey will be given to programs that help to continue Dr. King\u2019s work regarding economic empowerment for communities of color. \u201cWe were honored to learn of the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 desire to pay homage to Dr. King\u2019s life and legacy by using him as the focus of their 2020 \u2013 21 MLK Nike City Edition uniform design. During this challenging climate, it is our hope that this visual reminder of Dr. King\u2019s legacy will inspire people to further educate themselves on how he effected change using his philosophy and methods of nonviolence during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. We look forward to continuing to work with the Hawks to perpetuate his wonderful legacy,\u201d said Eric D. Tidwell, Esq., Managing Director & General Counsel of Intellectual Properties Management, Inc., (Manager of the Estate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.). The 2020\u201321 Atlanta Hawks MLK Nike City Edition uniform pays homage to the world\u2019s greatest \u201cDrum Major for Justice\u201d through personal elements woven into the design details and a thoughtfully selected color scheme. The uniform was created through a collaborative effort between the Nike design team, Hawks ownership, and the team\u2019s CMO, Melissa Proctor, V.P. of Brand Creative Shirley Zhang, and V.P. of Brand Merchandising Amy Serino. The Colorway: I  nfinity Black: This principal hue of the Atlanta Hawks Nike Statement Edition and City Edition uniforms denotes the team\u2019s bold, relentless, and unapologetic approach to competition and community. Vintage Gold: The subtle and sedate golden tone highlights the reverence befitting the memory of a global icon and reflects an air of sophistication. Fidelity White: Dedication and loyalty to the great city of Atlanta along with the ideals of equality and compassion come through in this crisp and classic white. The Black, Gold and White colorway speaks to Dr. King\u2019s determination, as well as his understated style. It is also a nod to Dr. King\u2019s membership in the first Black Greek fraternity. Bold Vintage Gold MLK letters, outlined in Fidelity White, blaze across the uniform chest, the initials of an eternal role model whose words of equality and justice are the foundation of today\u2019s powerful activism. The stars donning both sides of the shorts represent 22 of the 29 times Dr. King was jailed fighting for justice and equality, while also paying tribute to the dedicated student freedom fighters who engaged in sit-ins all over the South. Of them, he said, \u201cOnly when it is dark enough can you see the stars.\u201d Towards the bottom of the jersey, Dr. King\u2019s personal signature graces the authenticity tag. Several of the design details of the uniform are inspired by architectural elements of churches where Dr. King delivered some of his most moving sermons. The uniform is bordered in White and Gold striping that lead to tapered peak at the side of the shorts mirroring the silhouette of stained-glass windows. The crown and shield symbol on the leg of the shorts is inspired by church windows and Dr. King\u2019s personal effects. At the waistband is the Hawks\u2019 Primary Icon logo encircled in black symbolizing the continuous quest of the Black community to achieve freedom and justice. This heat-applied graphic is made of a soft touch rubber. The Nike Swoosh placed at the right jersey strap, just opposite of the Sharecare jersey partner patch above the heart. Since 2017, the Atlanta Hawks have held a multiyear partnership with Sharecare, the Atlanta-based digital health company, which serves as the team\u2019s inaugural jersey patch sponsor and its partner in the Sharecare Movement \u2014 a community-driven initiative launched by both organizations to make Georgia and Atlanta one of the healthiest places in the country. In addition to the Sharecare patch over the \u201cheart\u201d of every jersey, the Atlanta Hawks and Sharecare are united by a shared passion and pride for the legacy of Atlanta and our world-changing leaders like Dr. King, whose life\u2019s works paved the way for happier, healthier, and more equitable futures for all. The team will wear the MLK Nike City Edition uniforms at select games throughout the 2020-21 season. In conjunction with the MLK kit, a complimentary MLK City Edition-branded court for home games will extend the important recognition of Dr. King to the main floor of State Farm Arena. Mirroring the uniform colorway and stars detail, the court design will feature the stylized Hawks Primary Icon logo at the center which also incorporates the team\u2019s core uniform colors \u2014 Torch Red and Legacy Yellow \u2014 in a mosaic pattern that continues the stained-glass motif.
