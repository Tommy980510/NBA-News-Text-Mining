This has been a collaborative effort between the Magic, City of Orlando, Orange County and Orange County Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles. The facility will be open starting October 19 \u2013 November 1, 8 a.m. \u2013 8 p.m. on the north side of Amway Center at the Church Street entrance inside the Disney Atrium. All registered voters from Orange County will be able to cast their ballot at the Amway Center location, which is one of 20 early voting locations within Orange County. In addition, on National Voter Registration Day, Amway Center will be open on September 22 for voter registration. This will also take place inside the Disney Atrium from 10 a.m. \u2013 2 p.m. The deadline to register to vote is October 5 and people can visit www.registertovoteflorida.gov for more information. The NBA recently announced that its teams, players and coaches agreed to immediately establish a social justice coalition, with representatives from players, coaches and team governors, that will be focused on a broad range of issues, including increasing access to voting, promoting civic engagement and advocating for meaningful police and criminal justice reform. The league will work with the players and network partners to create and include advertising spots in each NBA playoff game dedicated to promoting greater civic engagement in national and local elections and raising awareness around voter access and opportunity. In addition, the NBA has created the NBA Foundation that will contribute $300 million in initial funding focused on economic empowerment in the Black community. Over the next 10 years, the 30 NBA team owners will collectively contribute $30 million annually establishing this new, leaguewide charitable foundation. Through its mission to drive economic empowerment for Black communities through employment and career advancement, the NBA Foundation will seek to increase access and support for high school, college-aged and career-ready Black men and women, and assist national and local organizations that provide skills training, mentorship, coaching and pipeline development in NBA markets and communities across the United States and Canada.

A Black man had been shot seven times in the back by police. His name, Jacob Blake, became another hashtag. His kids, ages 3, 5 and 8, watched everything unfold. His injuries: paralyzed from the waist down. The incident occurred in Kenosha, Wis., about 40 miles south of the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 home arena. It also took place just two weeks after the mother of Breonna Taylor spoke at a news conference and emphasized these four words: \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than Breonna.\u201d The shooting of Blake revealed as much. Taylor\u2019s mother expressed that African Americans have been victims of police violence at a disproportionate rate . Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce is vocalizing the same message. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Breonna Taylor, but it\u2019s really about what she represents as a Black woman that was killed for no reason,\u201d Pierce told NBA.com. A dozen years before Pierce became the head coach in Atlanta, the city was shaken to its core by a tragedy similar to Taylor\u2019s. Police executed a no-knock warrant for the home of Kathryn Johnston, a 92-year-old Black woman who lived by herself. When plainclothes officers broke down the front door of her home, Johnston discharged her personal firearm, unaware that the intruders were police. She shot once and missed. The officers shot 39 times and killed her. Realizing their mistake, police handcuffed Johnston as she was dying and planted drugs inside her basement. Later investigations determined the no-knock warrant was falsified. \u201c(Police) have got a really tough job,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cBut the price people have paid when they get it wrong, that\u2019s what we\u2019re most focused on because it\u2019s been wrong too often. Similar to Kathryn Johnston. Similar to Breonna Taylor.\u201d The three officers involved in Johnston\u2019s death were sentenced to prison. Many NBA players have been calling for the arrests of the officers who killed Taylor. The 26-year-old emergency medical technician was shot to death in March when three plainclothes officers from the Louisville Metro Police Department executed a no-knock warrant on her apartment.  The shooting is currently being investigated by the FBI and Kentucky attorney general. (9\/23 Update: This story was originally published on Sept. 2, three weeks before the Kentucky attorney general announced wanton endangerment charges for one police officer regarding his actions on the night Taylor was killed. Activists have demanded larger charges.) Pierce believes holding law enforcement accountable is necessary. He also realizes that arresting three officers won\u2019t stop another Breonna Taylor from happening in a different city. Such was the case with Kathryn Johnston. \u201cI think we have to advance what we\u2019re talking about to greater extremes,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe need to be educated on the areas of reform that are in need, and then rally behind. We want to prevent (another) Breonna Taylor scenario.\u201d  Pierce is a 44-year-old Black man. He\u2019s drained, exhausted and \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d He was born around the same time America\u2019s war against drugs began, which many have cited as a systemic cause to Taylor\u2019s death since she was killed in a narcotics raid. No drugs were found in her apartment, according to multiple reports. It\u2019s been well-documented that the drug war has targeted communities of color at a disproportionate rate. For example, Black people are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, despite the fact that Blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates, per the American Civil Liberties Union . A separate ACLU study found that minorities are targeted most in narcotics raids done by SWAT teams. \u201cWe\u2019re still fully in the midst of that same war on drugs that has been unequivocally prosecuted against the Black community,\u201d said Dr. Peter Kraska, a criminal justice professor at Eastern Kentucky University. \u201cIt\u2019s of course not only prosecuted against Blacks. It\u2019s just significantly disproportionate.\u201d Kraska is working as an expert witness in Taylor\u2019s case. He\u2019s studied and worked alongside police doing no-knock raids on Black homes. \u201cI think when these high-profile voices and athletes speak up, it\u2019s not that they are being critical of all police officers,\u201d Kraska said. \u201cIt\u2019s being critical of what policing as an institution has turned into. I think it\u2019s really important to make the distinction between the police institution needing major changes, as opposed to talking about good cops and bad cops.\u201d Pierce is currently leading a committee with the National Basketball Coaches Association that focuses on racial injustice and reform. Their goal is to pursue solutions in NBA cities \u201cwith local leaders, officials and law enforcement agencies to create positive change in our communities.\u201d \u201cI think we have a great opportunity,\u201d Pierce said, \u201cto join in with people who have done the work and be educated more about how to propose and enact change.\u201d * * * Louisville councilwoman Barbara Sexton Smith is doing the work Pierce alluded to. Now she wants the NBA \u2014 from governors to players \u2014 to help her do more. Sexton Smith is the councilwoman who authored \u201cBreonna\u2019s Law.\u201d The historic ordinance placed a total ban on no-knock warrants in Louisville. \u201cThere will not be a no-knock warrant in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut secondly, as part of Breonna\u2019s Law, we have laid out very clearly how all search warrants will be conducted. Whether it\u2019s for minor things or serious things.\u201d For example, Louisville police are no longer able to do investigatory search warrant raids on people\u2019s private residences for contraband. If there\u2019s an imminent threat inside a home (such as a hostage situation), a warrant is not necessary for entry. Under Breonna\u2019s Law, officers will be disciplined if body cameras aren\u2019t worn during the execution of a search warrant. The city council is also working on implementing a civilian review board. While these measures have been applauded, Louisville is just one city. Oregon and Florida are the only states that bar no-knock warrants. As studies show , Taylor\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. This form of tragedy has happened across the nation for years, disproportionately affecting African Americans. It happened in Georgia to Johnston. It happened in Michigan to 7-year-old Aiyana Mo\u2019Nay Stanley-Jones, who was killed when police were executing a no-knock warrant in 2010. It happened in Ohio to Tarika Wilson; she was shot to death while holding her 14-month-old son during a raid 12 years ago. Even police officers are in peril, considering many Americans have firearms. Between 2010 and 2016 alone, 13 law enforcement officers died in door-busting drug raids, according to a 2017 study from The New York Times . More than six times as many civilians (81) were killed during the period of the study, with many more injured. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even make any sense for the police themselves,\u201d Kraska said, referring to no-knock raids. \u201cThe gain that they\u2019re getting versus the risk they\u2019re taking with their own lives just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Kraska stressed significant reform as a solution. The NBA and NBPA established a social justice coalition that includes \u201cadvocating for meaningful police and criminal justice reform.\u201d Asked how this could be done, Sexton Smith referred back to the beginning of this summer. She thought about the national attention that helped get Breonna\u2019s Law passed in Louisville through a unanimous vote by the city council. \u201cIn the 30 cities where there is an NBA team,\u201d Sexton Smith said. \u201cI would like to see those owners and those players say to their respective city council, you must pass Breonna\u2019s Law as step one. Then we\u2019re going to go right down the line with all of the legislation that you can do on a city council level to address systemic racism. Every NBA team has that type of power and influence in their city. Then I want them to put it on their state legislatures, and then collectively on Washington, D.C.\u201d Pierce doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s too much to ask. The Hawks head coach wants the league to back legislation proactively, not just in response to social media clips of police violence. There\u2019s an old saying: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In other words, it\u2019s better to stop something from happening in the first place than to keep repairing the damage after it\u2019s done. \u201cWe should be proactively trying to find ways to address these situations from a legal, legislative stand because of the resources that we have, because of the access that we have, because of the platform that we have,\u201d Pierce told NBA TV . \u201cWe should be doing these things proactively because we are a part of 30 different communities throughout the country \u2026 and that means we have to include our ownership. We have to include our management. We have to include the league front office with the concerns that the players are speaking of.\u201d * * * For Pierce, no athlete has ever inspired him more than Muhammad Ali. Pierce is smitten by Ali\u2019s unprecedented speed and skills in the boxing ring but driven by the unmatched \u201cbravery and courage\u201d he exhibited when the gloves were off. Now more than ever, athletes in every sport find themselves inspired by Ali\u2019s sacrifice and commitment to speak out against racism and inequality. \u201cI think today\u2019s generation of athletes are really following in Ali\u2019s footsteps in a way that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Pierce said. The admiration for \u201cThe Greatest\u201d resonates even deeper in Louisville. Particularly, for Sexton Smith. Ali was her friend.  The world heavyweight champ and shrewd city councilwoman were born in Louisville, a city deeply rooted in racial segregation . Located in Sexton Smith\u2019s district is the high school Ali attended, as well as the Muhammad Ali Museum and Education Center. The museum explores Ali\u2019s six core principles: confidence, conviction, dedication, giving, respect and spirituality. Sexton Smith and Ali met for the first time at a 2004 ceremony, which celebrated the museum\u2019s development. Ali \u201cdid a lot of boxing poses and moved throughout the crowd bringing fun, laughter and peace to all,\u201d she remembered. Sexton Smith served on the museum\u2019s Board of Trustees for six years. When Ali died in 2016, she helped plan his funeral alongside his wife. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said at the time: \u201cWhile we are deeply saddened by his loss, Muhammad Ali\u2019s legacy lives on in every athlete who takes a stand for what he or she believes.\u201d NBA and WNBA players did so last week with their protests against police violence. \u201cI think Muhammad Ali would have smiled,\u201d Sexton Smith said. \u201cPlayers took a stance because they believed it was the right thing to do at the right time.\u201d Ali used his high profile as an outspoken critic to social injustices. He convened with athletes from other sports, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell, to share his convictions. He advocated for new laws. He traveled around the country to empower young Black students at HBCUs. One of those students was \u201cBlack Panther\u201d actor Chadwick Boseman, who died on Friday after a private battle with colon cancer. Boseman once said that as a student at Howard University, seeing Ali on campus made him \u201cready to take on the world.\u201d That is the type of power athletes carry. While it\u2019s on them to exercise it, the NBA at large can amplify it. \u201cWhen \u2018I\u2019 is replaced with \u2018we\u2019 even illness becomes wellness\u201d \u2013 Malcolm X. The social justice coalition is composed of players, coaches and governors. As they seek to ameliorate the system and dismantle structural racism, multiple barriers will be targeted. Police reform and voting is at the top of the list. Furthermore, the recently announced NBA Foundation is intended to create greater economic empowerment in the Black community, including specific partnerships with HBCUs. \u201cWe should start with police reform,\u201d Sexton Smith said. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping America will not take their eyes off the fact that it\u2019s also bigger than police reform. It\u2019s voting, housing, education, healthcare, employment, the environment. It\u2019s so much more. \u201cIf we get officers arrested, charged, indicted and convicted, is that going to do anything to change the wealth gap in America? It would be a victory, but will that do anything to change the percentage of Black-owned businesses? How many Black lives will be changed for the better? Where does that take institutional oppression? Will that stop all the harmful drug raids? Remember, it\u2019s bigger than Breonna.\u201d Likewise, for basketball . * * * Khari Arnold is a Senior Producer at  NBA.com  and graduate from Howard University. You can email him  here  .

(AP) \u2014 DraftKings shares jumped in midday trading after announcing that basketball legend Michael Jordan would take an ownership stake in the company in exchange for becoming a special adviser to the sports betting site. Boston-based DraftKings did not release details on the amount of Jordan\u2019s stake in the company. Jordan is the majority owner of the NBA\u2019s Charlotte Hornets and the deal has the league\u2019s approval. \u201cNBA team investors, including governors, are permitted to have involvement with sports betting and fantasy sports businesses, subject to safeguards required under league rules to prevent actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\u201d an NBA spokesperson said Wednesday. Jordan\u2019s interest in DraftKings is not expected to affect the Hornets\u2019 presence on the site. The NBA agreed to a multiyear deal about a year ago to make DraftKings an official sports betting operator. The NBA has several similar arrangements, including one with DraftKings\u2019 longtime daily fantasy sports rival FanDuel, and struck a first-of-its-kind deal with MGM Resorts International in 2018 to be compensated for providing official data as a way for those casinos to determine outcomes of various bets. That differs from the way Golden Nugget casinos, owned by Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, are permitted to handle games involving his NBA club. Golden Nugget sports books in Nevada, New Jersey and Mississippi can accept NBA wagers, but cannot for games involving the Rockets. Jordan has made no secret of his affinity for gambling, whether playing blackjack in casinos or making bets during a round of golf. As a player for the Chicago Bulls, Jordan famously went to Atlantic City in between games of the 1993 Eastern Conference finals against the New York Knicks, revealing details of the trip in \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d docuseries released earlier this year by ESPN and Netflix. Jordan also said he never bet on NBA games. DraftKings said Jordan would immediately \u201cprovide strategic and creative input to the board of directors on company strategy, product development, inclusion, equity and belonging, marketing activities and other key initiatives.\u201d After jumping about 10% at the market open, shares in DraftKings were up about 1% in midday trading. *** AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Lake Buena Vista, Florida contributed to this story."},{"id":25916,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-jazz-donovan-mitchell-reach-max-extension","date":"2020-09-02","title":"Report: Jazz, Donovan Mitchell to finalize max extension","content":" The Utah Jazz and Donovan Mitchell plan to finalize a maximum rookie contract extension when free agency opens, according to Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes .

Playing a Game 7 in a time machine is something altogether different. The way the Denver Nuggets and the Utah Jazz had lit each other up through the first six games of their first-round playoff series \u2014 putting up nearly 235 points each game, on average \u2014 another scoring spectacle seemed certain. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell had spent most of the series matching bucket for bucket, moment for moment, lighting up not only the scoreboards in the Disney campus but the NBA record book. They shot their way in, joining the likes of Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Jerry West and other big-time postseason points producers by going for 30, 40, even 50 points (twice each) or more. There was no reason to think it would stop. In fact, the NBA\u2019s broadcast partners knew they were onto a good thing and started touting the 1-on-1 shootout as soon as Game 7 hit the schedule Sunday. And then the Nuggets and the Jazz dragged everybody back to the 1990s, for an old-school NBA grindfest. No, 80-78 wasn\u2019t the halftime score \u2014 that was the final. Way back in October, when Houston beat Washington 159-158 in the 2019-20 season\u2019s first full week, the Rockets and the Wizards each scored more than the Nuggets and the Jazz posted together Tuesday. Denver got 15 points in the third quarter, 15 more in the fourth, and still managed to advance to a Western Conference semifinals matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers (9 ET, TNT) . The individual shootout never happened. Denver\u2019s Murray and Utah\u2019s Mitchell wound up combining for 39 points, about half of what they\u2019d been averaging. It was\u2026 \u201cWeird\u201d was the word Murray used afterward. \u201cI only had 17, Donovan had 22,\u201d the Nuggets backcourt star said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird now.\u201d Murray suffered a bruised left thigh during the action, colliding with Utah\u2019s Joe Ingles as he pushed the ball in transition. Mitchell was the series\u2019 hardest-working player by far and had to be running on fumes by the end. And it\u2019s true, as both agreed, they and their teammates had missed some shots every bit as good as ones that dropped throughout the previous six games. But the biggest reason the offensive tap got turned off was the level of defense the Northwest Division rivals played. Only makes sense, right? Both of them spent 48 hours after Game 6 brainstorming ways to at least slow down Murray or Mitchell, respectively. The team that did it better had a great shot to advance. So, of course, they both tightened up on the star guards. Then there was the Game 7 effect, with the pace slowed, possessions treasured and a heavy dose of playing-not-to-lose stirred in. Each team choked off the other for stretches. Utah scored only 36 points in the first half and trailed by 14. Denver got its 30 after the intermission and had to sweat out Mike Conley\u2019s desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer that rimmed out. Neither team cracked 40 percent in shooting. They missed 49 of 65 3-pointers. It was far from the style we\u2019ve grown accustomed each spring from Golden State or Houston, a back-and-forth struggle to get and make good looks. And it was tremendous, because, y\u2019know, Game 7. Denver used its length effectively early to cut off passing angles and shield the rim. The Nuggets trapped effectively against Utah\u2019s pick-and-roll, too, especially early in the largely halfcourt game. The Jazz got their turn after halftime. Center Rudy Gobert, after being hampered by early fouls, got more aggressive. He challenged Denver players who intruded through the lane and, despite Nikola Jokic\u2019s 30 points, made the Nuggets center work hard or stray outside. It was the scratching, clawing kind of game that, let\u2019s face it, was all too common in the \u201890s, before shot value and true shooting and other analytics pushed the game out to the corners and just out, out, period. But it was refreshing too now that ski-ball has taken over, the pendulum swinging so far to the perimeter. It was the kind of game in which guys like Gary Harris and Royce O\u2019Neal could have impact nearly as great as Murray or Mitchell. Harris, a solid two-way player with more consistent value as a defender, was playing for only the second time since early March, returning for Game 6 from a hobbling hip injury. Harris made Mitchell\u2019s night hard, denying the Jazz guard easy catches or unchallenged progress up the floor. Then with less than nine seconds left, he poked the ball away from Mitchell from behind for the game\u2019s single biggest stop. \u201cSome people can look at this box score and say, \u2018Gary Harris struggled, he was 1-of-9 from the field,\u2019\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t win this game without Gary. His defense, his containment, his 1-on-1 pride is just outstanding. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been such a big part of our team for the last five years.\u201d O\u2019Neale, an undrafted forward out of Baylor in 2017, signed a four-year deal with Utah in January, about seven weeks before the virus shutdown. He started 62 games during the season and showed real value (plus 5.2 net rating), none more so than his work in Game 7 against Murray. With assistance from teammates, O\u2019Neale\u2019s focus helped limit the explosive Denver guard to 7-of-21 shooting and a minus-4 night overall. \u201cRoyce was on him, Mike was on him, Donovan at a certain point felt he wanted to guard him,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cThe entire game was such a competitive, hard-fought game, there was nothing that was easy.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem right that Utah now gets lumped in with 11 other teams in NBA playoff history that grabbed 3-1 leads in a series, only to lose. Heck, it doesn\u2019t seem right that after the league set up those seeding games and a play-in gimmick to invited an extra six teams into the bubble that the Jazz should be leaving it after such a noble performance. \u201cMaybe one rebound, one loose ball, two free throws,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cYou really realize what the great teams go through to control the details. And do it over and over and over.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Jazz and Nuggets took their series right down to the seventh-game buzzer \u2014 like, what else can you ask for? \u2014 when Mike Conley\u2019s 3-point shot rimmed out, causing Mitchell to fall out, allowing Murray and the Nuggets to move on after falling behind 3-1 in the series. \u201cA good series to watch,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cHigh level performances. Game 7 is something you can feel and experience.\u201d It was quite the struggle between Rocky Mountain rivals and especially between Mitchell and Murray, a pair of 23-year-old guards who sizzled for most of the six previous games yet were clearly gassed in the seventh. Before Tuesday\u2019s winner-take-all, they\u2019d combined for four 50-point games, with Mitchell averaging 38.7 points in the series and Murray averaging 47.3 in the previous three games. Eventually, their 475 combined points were the most ever by two players in a series. And they were the picture of efficiency as well by shooting above 50 percent from the floor and beyond the arc. But in the end, it was endurance that decided the outcome, not either player. Murray needed 21 shots to score 17 points while Mitchell had the ball poked away by Gary Harris on Utah\u2019s penultimate possession. It was understandable that Mitchell collapsed to the floor in a mix of (mostly) frustration and exhaustion once the buzzer sounded. \u201cIt was a great battle and it\u2019s not only going to be for one year. We expect to see a lot of each other in the future,\u201d said Murray. \u201cHe raises my game, I raise his. It\u2019s a whole lot of fun. We bring out the best in each other.\u201d This was a relief for the Nuggets, who played their third straight seven-game series dating back to last season, beating the Spurs and losing to the Blazers previously. Perhaps those tense experiences helped pull Denver through Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many players have had the chance to play in three Game 7s in two years,\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. \u201cThat comfort of being there before helps. Game 7s come down to possessions, they come down to rebounds, they come down to two evenly matched teams.\u201d Meanwhile, the Rockets are reeling after losing three of the last four games in this series, buried under the rubble of turnovers, a lack of an answer for Chris Paul and a gimpy Russell Westbrook. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for the losses we\u2019ve had in this series,\u201d Rockets forward PJ Tucker said. Another poor showing from the Rockets might mean a shakeup is coming. Is Mike D\u2019Antoni coaching for his future in Houston? That\u2019s likely the case, if only because he lacks a contractual cushion and had to fight for stability the last time he and the Rockets discussed his future. Any dismissal of D\u2019Antoni might be due to face-saving by the Rockets, who surrendered assets along with Paul to Oklahoma City and in the short term will have nothing but a first-round ouster to show for it with a loss Wednesday. Remember, with James Harden in his prime, they\u2019re a win-now team, or at least a win-soon team. And also two evenly matched players. While Murray moves on to see the Clippers starting Thursday, Mitchell goes home with a bit of solace. \u201cWe hope Donovan continues to grow through this leap he\u2019s making,\u201d Conley said. The more graver picture is the long-term. Harden would burn yet another year without reaching the NBA Finals with Houston, and that would be tough to swallow for someone who has been in the Kia MVP discussion for the last five years, winning that trophy once. And of course it could be a referendum on Westbrook, who\u2019s coming off a seven-turnover game. Before arriving in Houston he averaged a triple-double over three seasons and won the MVP. But his shooting, especially from deep, has badly regressed; he\u2019s fallen under 30 percent in five of the last six seasons. Defenders are giving him space, the sign of disrespect, and Westbrook has all but bailed on the 3-pointer anyway. He\u2019s now relying almost exclusively on his burst and quickness. Those skills, however, tend to fade once players age, and in addition to dealing with recovery from a strained right quad, Westbrook turns 32 in November. Besides Paul, the price for Westbrook was considerable. Houston also sent first-round picks in 2024 and 2026 and gave OKC the right to swap picks in 2021 and 2025. If Westbrook suffers any significant decline, those picks could be gold. And that underlines the position OKC is in right now. First, consider that Paul\u2019s impact has been massive this season, making OKC a mild surprise in 2019-20. Then there\u2019s his conditioning. Paul appears to be in the best shape in years, proof of his commitment and determination to remain one of the league\u2019s elite point guards even after 15 seasons. Paul was thought to be ready for a gradual downhill slide at the time, and he\u2019ll turn 36 next season. \u201cPhysically he looks really good,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cHe played 40-something minutes the other night. And he\u2019s a competitor, we know that.\u201d Once you consider what OKC received in exchange for Westbrook and Paul George, the only potential downside is Paul\u2019s remaining contact \u2014 it\u2019s now two years and $88 million \u2014 yet given the value he\u2019s shown, maybe that money isn\u2019t an albatross after all. And then, the goodies from those two deals: Sam Presti, the GM, squeezed the Clippers and Rockets for a total of seven first-round picks and the right to swap four additional first-round picks over the next six years, plus a promising young guard in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a solid starter in Danilo Gallinari. The Thunder will also shed contracts belonging to Steven Adams and Dennis Schroeder next summer, leaving Paul on the books as the only player who\u2019ll make eight figures. That\u2019s a war chest of assets and also future financial flexibility for a rebuilding team, yet the Thunder remain a playoff team. So OKC is playing with house money with this Game 7 because the last 12 months have been blissful no matter what. Before he galloped to the locker room with his jubilant and relieved Nuggets teammates after the win, Murray raced toward Mitchell and lifted him up. They hugged it out, wished each other well, a fitting scene for a Nuggets-Jazz series that had everything. And what will be the everlasting snapshot of Rockets-Thunder? Hard to tell, but D\u2019Antoni suspects raw emotion will determine the outcome. \u201cThe players will be engaged and the bench will be engaged,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe just have to be better than them and move forward. We know what they have to do. You have to get your mind right. We know we\u2019ve been in a fight.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

With Boston holding a 2-0 series lead, Game 3 will be Thursday  (6:30 p.m. ET, TNT) . These are two great defenses and, appropriately, this has not been a pretty offensive series. The two teams have combined to score 407 points on 405 possessions, with the Raptors shooting 39% and the Celtics committing 40 turnovers. The Celtics scored just 42 points on 49 possessions over the second and third quarters on Tuesday. Through 36 minutes, they had only six buckets in the restricted area, on their way to finishing with just eight (their fewest in any game this season). But because the Raptors hadn\u2019t run away (their biggest lead was 12), Boston just needed one good offensive stretch to turn the game around. \u201cWe had 12 minutes left in the game,\u201d Jayson Tatum said, \u201cso we had more than enough time to get back in the game and give ourselves a chance to win, so we wasn\u2019t worried.\u201d Smart, who shot 1-for-7 through the first three quarters ( the one make was on the Celtics\u2019 second possession of the game), provided that needed flurry early in the fourth, scoring the Celtics\u2019 first 16 points of the period. The Raptors\u2019 defense was better on Tuesday than it was in Game 1 \u2014 the last four of those five 3s weren\u2019t nearly as open as some as the looks Smart got two days earlier \u2014 but the first one was wide open, and there was no stopping Smart after that. \u201cI\u2019m laughing to myself and to the opponent sometimes,\u201d Smart said afterward, \u201cjust telling them \u2018don\u2019t give me a good look. All I need is one.'\u201d Despite the cold start in Game 2, Smart is 11-for-20 from 3-point range in the series after going 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the first round. \u201cThey obviously got a lot of firepower around,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cBut he is kind of a wild card scorer for them, and he\u2019s had two huge games for them.\u201d After the Smart Show, it was Kemba Walker, who was 2-for-14 through the first 40 minutes , who scored 11 of the Boston\u2019s final 16 points, draining a pair of huge jumpers in the final three minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s a long game,\u201d Jayson Tatum said. \u201cEverybody had tough shooting nights. You would never tell anybody to stop shooting, especially somebody that\u2019s accomplished as much as [Walker] has and done it for 10, 11 years. When he\u2019s off, I always tell him to shoot the next one. When I\u2019m off, he tells me the same. You never know which one might get you going.\u201d There is a certain degree of mental toughness needed to fight through a night when shots aren\u2019t falling. \u201cI\u2019ve missed so many shots in my life,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI have missed so many shots throughout my career. I\u2019m never going to get down on myself.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say enough about that,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens added. \u201cThat\u2019s the part \u2013 an unwavering confidence where if you continue to do the right thing, the ball will find the net. I\u2019ll tell you what, Kemba\u2019s shots were huge. The pull-up off the side ball screen with about a minute and a half left was enormous. To struggle and then come back and make it was great.\u201d The Celtics made up for a 44-24 points-in-the-paint discrepancy by outscoring the champs by seven at the free throw line and by 12 from beyond the arc. And while it was Smart who caught fire in the fourth, the biggest part of those advantages was Tatum, who was 14-for-14 from the line, 4-for-7 from deep, and the Curry to Smart\u2019s Thompson during that fourth-quarter barrage. Tatum assisted on the first three of Smart\u2019s five fourth-quarter 3s, and then set him up with a \u201csecondary assist\u201d (followed by a Grant Williams swing pass) on the fifth. The evolution of Tatum from \u201cyoung player with promise\u201d to \u201c22-year-old star on a team with the goods to reach The Finals\u201d has been rapid, and its been mostly about his scoring (and his defense to a certain degree). He\u2019s become a more potent offensive player with improvement on off-the-dribble 3s (from 32.4% last season to 40.4% this season ) and a reduction in mid-range shots. But Tatum has also seen a jump in free throw rate, and while he got bailed out a couple of times ( one , two ) on possessions in which he didn\u2019t have much going, he was also aggressive in driving and drawing contact. Tatum\u2019s playmaking has yet to come as far as his scoring. In the regular season, he recorded assists on just 11.7% of his possessions, the third-lowest rate among 41 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. And in Game 1 on Sunday, Kemba Walker did a better job of heeding Brad Stevens\u2019 message to get off the ball quickly against Toronto\u2019s swarming defense, while Tatum was still a little too eager to play one-on-one. But that fourth-quarter run included a couple of high-level passes, a wicked, one-handed cross-court dime on Smart\u2019s second 3 and another cross-court kick-out to Williams , leading to the fifth of the five. Tatum finished with a career playoff highs in both points (34) and assists (six). \u201cI thought he was different tonight than even in Game 1,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI thought he attacked quicker. When he caught the ball he went right to what he was trying to get to. That was a big part of him being able to score the ball tonight.\u201d The Raptors can\u2019t help but feel that they let one get away. This was a one-possession game, with Fred VanVleet missing a long 3 for the tie at the buzzer. The Raptors were down 0-2 last year\u2019s conference finals against an opponent that looked like a juggernaut at the time. Through Game 2 of that series, the Milwaukee Bucks were 11-1 with a point differential of 15.3 points per game in the playoffs. These Celtics haven\u2019t been nearly as dominant. Four of their six postseason wins have been within five points in the last five minutes . But to make this a competitive series with a win in Game 3 on Thursday, the Raptors need to find a way to score more consistently. After building that 12-point lead late in the third quarter of Game 2, the Raptors scored just nine points over their next 21 possessions , shooting 3-for-21 (including 0-for-16 outside the restricted area ) over those 10 1\/2 minutes. After scoring 123 points per 100 possessions in their first-round sweep of Brooklyn, the Raptors have scored less than 96 per 100 in these two games. Their three leading scorers have all shot 36% or worse . This was the fear with the defending champs, and where they (finally) miss Kawhi Leonard. They\u2019ve been terrific all season in transition, but the half-court offense can struggle. But as they hope for more shots to fall, they can look at their opponent for inspiration. As the Celtics showed us on Tuesday, one hot stretch can make a difference. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

The talent and depth is undeniable. But the Clippers, save for six dominant quarters in the six games against the Mavericks, simply haven\u2019t looked like the juggernaut they\u2019re supposed to be. Reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard was steady and unguardable. But Paul George went through an ugly, three-game funk in the middle of the series and that dynamic bench duo of Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams didn\u2019t have the impact forecasted by award-worthy regular seasons. Doc Rivers is coaching the situation and circumstances in the bubble as much as he is the Clippers, not to mention these great expectations for the first time in franchise history. If the Clippers thought Luka Doncic was a handful, wait until they get a dose of the new and improved bubble version of Jamal Murray, provided he\u2019s healthy. The Nuggets rode Murray\u2019s flame-thrower routine to a dramatic Game 7 win over the Utah Jazz in the first round; a knee to his left quad in the first half of Game 7 is the only thing that slowed him down. The Nuggets, however, are far from a one-man show. Murray might have been the overall MVP of the first round, but this Nuggets team is built around the versatility of its All-NBA big man Nikola Jokic, who found a way to lift his team in Game. With he and Murray both in a groove, Nuggets coach Mike Malone has a number of options to use in matchups against the Clippers. He has arguably the deepest and most balanced roster in the league outside of the Clippers. They\u2019ve experienced three straight Game 7s and coming back from a 3-1 deficit to get back to the conference semifinals for the second straight season. 1. Has Paul George put his bubble demons to rest after a strong finish against the Mavericks? George admitted that his three-game tailspin in the middle of the first-round series against Dallas was more mental fatigue, the bubble at work, than anything physically wrong with his game. That won\u2019t ease the mind of Doc Rivers, who also admitted that he underestimated the toll the unique circumstances might have on his players. Now that they\u2019ve gotten a handle on it, George is free to get back to his All-Star ways. If the Clippers are serious about winning a championship, it\u2019s a must. 2. Is the Jamal Murray experience built to last? Murray is legit. He\u2019s a crafty operator capable of scoring at all three levels. And when his confidence is soaring the way it did in that first round series against the Jazz, a stout defensive team that simply had no answer for him, he takes the Nuggets to another level. Murray said he gained 12 pounds of muscle during the shutdown and showed up for the restart using each and every new ounce. He\u2019ll need it against a Clippers team that presents a much stiffer individual defensive challenge with Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and others available for duty. He\u2019ll only have a day to get that sore quad in shape for the biggest series of his career. 3. Are the Clippers locked in and focused on the Nuggets or peeking ahead to a potential conference final showdown against the Lakers? The first-round scare from Dallas should have extinguished any fat-cat syndrome that might have set in for the Clippers during the restart. Sure, the battle with the Lakers was the talk of Tinseltown (and the rest of the basketball universe) from the moment Kawhi Leonard and Paul George became Clippers. But there are no guarantees in the most unpredictable season in NBA history. The Clippers know they have to focus on the business at hand before worrying about anything else. 1.20 \u2014 Denver and Utah scored 1.14 and 1.13 points per possession on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions in their epic first-round series, according to Synergy play-type tracking. Those marks were both well above the best rate for any team in the regular season ( Portland\u2019s 0.99 ), but they were below the mark of the Clippers, who\u2019s ball-handlers scored 1.20 points per possession on pick-and-rolls in their first-round series against Dallas. The Clippers don\u2019t have one player who\u2019s going to handle the load as much as Donovan Mitchell or the Nuggets\u2019 own Jamal Murray. But the two players who\u2019ve scored most efficiently on at least five ball-handler possessions per game in these playoffs are Lou Williams (1.43 points per possession) and Kawhi Leonard (1.42), who are a combined 37-for-63 (59%) on pull-up 2-pointers , according to Second Spectrum tracking. The Clips also have a couple of capable roll men (Ivica Zubac and Montrezl Harrell), and they rank second in the playoffs in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage . So the Nuggets will have some more difficult decisions to make when it comes to defending the pick-and-roll. In the regular season, the Clippers had two of the six most efficient games (including a seeding-game win in which Leonard and Williams combined to shoot 10-for-13 on non-restricted-area 2s ) against Denver. \u2014 John Schuhmann The Nuggets are playing with the sort of freedom that\u2019s rare in the playoffs for a No. 3 seed that survives the scare from the Jazz in the first round. Rallying from that 3-1 deficit, just the 12th team in league history to do it, won\u2019t raise the expectations for them now, not with a heavily favored Clippers team rested and waiting on them. Doc Rivers has had the chance to get his crew refocused on taking all of the necessary steps toward competing for the championship they believe is in their future. With his roster healthier and Kawhi Leonard in his full cyborg mode after the challenge from the Mavericks, the Clippers will be on the hunt for an early knockout of a Nuggets team that, talented as they are, don\u2019t measure up to the Clippers on paper. The Nuggets were a fantastic story in the first round. They\u2019ll need to find another gear to make the conference semifinals as compelling.

Tony Evers. \u201cSurely there are things to talk about right now, right?\u201d Bucks guard Kyle Korver said at a Zoom session Tuesday from Lake Buena Vista, Florida, where the NBA playoffs are taking place. \u201cSurely there are things our state needs leadership in. How can we be better?\u201d He called the Legislature\u2019s inaction \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Democrats urged Republicans who control the Legislature to take up the bills, but both the state Senate and Assembly met for less than 30 seconds each before ending the session . Republican leaders gave no indication when they may reconvene. Republican Speaker Robin Vos touted a task force he created, while Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald suggested there would be dozens of bills to consider in the months ahead. Evers called lawmakers into a special session to consider a package of nine policing bills he first unveiled in June. They took no action then, but Evers tried to force them to take up the measures in the wake of a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer shooting Jacob Blake in the back on Aug. 23. The investigation into the police shooting of Blake, who is Black, is ongoing. The Bucks led an NBA walkout that stopped playoff games last week to express their frustration with the shooting of Blake and acts of racial injustice. President Donald Trump was in Kenosha on Tuesday. Korver said the team is trying to \u201cstand in the middle\u201d politically. \u201cWe can only control what we can control, and we have a big series that we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. The top-seeded Bucks lost to the Miami Heat in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series on Monday night. Game 2 is scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to partner with the other teams in the state in saying how can we be leaders because we need leadership in our state and in our country,\u201d Korver said. \u201cWe need leadership that is standing for the people. We need this right now. And we\u2019re not getting it. We don\u2019t want to be pulled one way or another. We\u2019re learning on the fly how to try to be in the middle, and it\u2019s tough, right?

Middleton said he hoped the Wisconsin Legislature would \u201cdo the right thing for the people, and just bring people together.\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said he too was disappointed in the Legislature. \u201cAt the end of the day, it feels like there\u2019s work to be done, and they\u2019re not doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re getting governing from the people that were elected, whether they be Republican or Democrat, in Wisconsin.\u201d"},{"id":25915,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/3-1-comebacks-nba-history","date":"2020-09-02","title":"Nuggets join rare company with 3-1 series comeback","content":" The Denver Nuggets made history on Tuesday, outlasting the Utah Jazz in a hard-fought Game 7 to become just the 12th team in NBA annals to rally from 3-1 down in a best-of-7 series.

BSE Global, the company that manages and operates the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center, will be encouraging its employees to serve as poll workers at Barclays Center or a location of their choosing. Additionally, BSE will work to grow civic engagement and inspire voter participation in the coming election through other ways, including sharing voter education materials on all team and arena social media channels and websites, and displaying similar digital signage on the exterior of the arena. Over the next two months, BSE will also be providing its employees with opportunities to volunteer with voter registration organizations. \u201cThe Nets and Barclays Center are committed to doing our part in providing a safe and convenient option for the community to vote in the upcoming general election,\u201d said Abbamondi. \u201cThe NYC Board of Elections has been a great partner during our discussions over the past two months to determine the safest way to host polling for early voting and Election Day at Barclays Center.

I applaud Barclays Center for opening their space to New Yorkers who are looking to vote in person this year, whether early or on Election Day, and supporting our ongoing commitment to expanding civic participation in the borough of Brooklyn. I hope this partnership serves as a model for similar facilities and spaces nationwide.\u201d \u201cVoting rights are under attack in this country,\u201d said Majority Leader Cumbo. \u201cAs a global pandemic threatens our ability to safely access the polls, and we have executive leadership whose continued attempts to suppress voters threaten the future of our democracy, it is up to local governments and leadership to innovate and ensure equal voting opportunities.

The Celtics won championships both times and he got to know Bill Russell. Of course, that\u2019s not the NBA connection that made Thompson famous and beloved and why he\u2019s receiving a moment of silence at these NBA playoffs. He took risks on Black teenagers, brought them to Georgetown, coached them on basketball and schooled them on life. Most became nine-to-fivers \u2026 others became Hall of Famers Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutumbo. I have a longer link to two of those players and a smaller one to Thompson. I was around Ewing for years when he played for the Knicks in the 1990s and I wrote for Newsday . Ewing then could be quirky and sometimes distant, distrustful traits he brought from Georgetown, certainly endorsed by Thompson. However, Ewing always carried himself like a professional, which also was endorsed by Thompson. My relationship with Ewing improved after he retired. My time with Mutombo has been much more meaningful. Our daughters were high school teammates in Atlanta. He\u2019s been to my house, I\u2019ve been to his home (his is bigger). And Mutumbo is everything you heard about him: Loyal, friendly, humble, compassionate, a fighter for Africa and human rights. Everyone loves Dikembe. Few humans on Earth are more genuine, or taller, or have a more distinctive voice. And I suspect his high character was also partly due to Thompson, who had heavy influence on an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thompson was complicated. He could be profane, stubborn and standoffish. He was also a father-figure, a beacon of hope and defended whatever cause he felt was righteous. He was a strong presence in college basketball and Black communities everywhere. \u201cBig John\u201d was truly larger than life. I discovered and experienced some of the above on a single day when he made me a better reporter. At the height of Hoyamania, I was a student at Howard University just on the other side of Washington, D.C., from Georgetown, and also sports editor of our campus newspaper. My calls to \u201cBig John\u201d for an interview went unreturned for days. I was young then and didn\u2019t know this was pretty standard in the business, especially involving high-profile people. But I was angry. So the next time I called his secretary, I pretended to be Larry Spriggs, a player at Howard (and reserve on the Lakers during the \u201cShowtime\u201d era) whose brother, Ed, played for John. Hey, I wanted a story \u2014 you had to admire my grind. This persistence would pay off much later. Big John picked up immediately: \u201cLarry, what\u2019s up? How\u2019s it going?\u201d  \u201c Uh, well, um, coach, this isn\u2019t Larry. This is Shaun Powell with The Hilltop newspaper and I want to ask you a few questions.\u201d The next 20 seconds almost destroyed my eardrums. \u201cBig John\u201d cussed like 10 sailors. You could combine all the tough interviews I\u2019d get much later in my career and none had as many MFs than I heard from him. Then, silence. Then, a grumble: \u201cWell, are you gonna ask me a [expletive] question, young man?\u201d RIP, \u201cBig John.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Paul scored 15 of his team-high 28 points in the fourth quarter and fueled a magical Oklahoma City run in the last three minutes and 35 seconds that saw the Thunder turn a six-point deficit into yet another victory. What else did we expect from OKC, which entered this contest owning a league-best record of 31-15 in clutch time? \u201cAs far as our team, that\u2019s who we are,\u201d Paul said in his TNT postgame interview . \u201cWe\u2019re built for stuff like this. A lot of guys on our team [have] been pushed out, traded or what-not. But we just stick together, and we keep fighting.\u201d Apparently. As OKC has forced us to mention in this space before, clutch time is defined by any game separated by five points or fewer in the final five minutes. After embarking on a 10-0 run to counter a Thunder 16-3 run, the Rockets led 94-92 with five minutes remaining as Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan inserted his closing lineup of Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Dennis Schroder, Danilo Gallanari, and Steven Adams. Just 10 seconds into clutch time, James Harden nailed a step-back 3-pointer to extend Houston\u2019s advantage to five points, and then followed up by sinking a technical free throw \u2014 courtesy of a Paul outburst \u2014 to put the Rockets up six with 4:19 left. \u201cI think our guys have confidence and belief,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessarily a carry-over, but I think anytime you\u2019ve done something, and you\u2019ve done it multiple times, there\u2019s a belief inside the group that we had to come back and keep playing and fighting.\u201d In Game 4, Paul scored eight points in clutch time to help OKC tie the series 2-2 with a 117-114 win . This time, Paul scored eight of the Thunder\u2019s final 12 points down the stretch, starting with back-to-back 3-pointers that tied the score at 98 with 2:57 left. Paul knocked down the second 3-pointer on a step-back 26-foot jumper over Robert Covington, before patting the Rockets center on the backside as they trotted back up court. Paul also managed to tally a pair of steals over the final 2:33, before hitting a pair of free-throws to give OKC the lead for good. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it his whole career. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll come out with the formula [in Game 7] to stop it. He would have been out of the league 10 years ago if somebody figured out how to stop him. We\u2019ve just got to play better. We\u2019ve just got to be more careful with the ball.\u201d The Rockets committed four turnovers in clutch time, led by Russell Westbrook, who registered two of his game-high seven turnovers over the last 1:42. Playing in just his second game since Aug. 11, Westbrook turned over the ball on his fifth errant pass of the night with 13.1 seconds left and his team down by two points. The Rockets committed 22 turnovers after averaging the fewest (11) in the league through the first five games of the playoffs. With 9:07 left to play in the third quarter, Houston had already registered its 12th turnover. \u201cThat\u2019s just my fault, honestly,\u201d said Westbrook, who spent almost the entirety of his nearly four and a half-minute postgame interview staring down at his phone . \u201cLast game, I had zero [turnovers]. Tonight, I had seven. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Westbrook\u2019s teams own a postseason record of 4-10 when he commits seven turnovers or more. But Harden took responsibility, too, after scoring a game-high 32 points to go with seven assists. \u201cA lot of careless turnovers, including myself,\u201d Harden said. \u201cJust too many turnovers, especially in a playoff game, in a close-out game. We just gave them too many opportunities. But I had five [turnovers]. So, we\u2019ve both got to be better with the basketball. Twelve turnovers between the two [of us], if we cut those down to half, we give ourselves a better chance to get shot opportunities.\u201d With Paul on the floor in Game 6, OKC outscored Houston by 20 points. What\u2019s more, is Paul continued to grow his reputation as a clutch performer. Paul leads the NBA in clutch scoring this season (171 points), including the playoffs, shooting 52.5% from the floor in clutch time and 40.6% from deep. Paul shot 3 of 6 from distance for the game, and 3 of 3 in the fourth quarter. \u201cChris, in those situations, he is really, really an elite 3-point shooter,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cHe gets so much credit for being such a savant as a basketball player, and [having] so [much] basketball I.Q., intellect, feel for the game, it is off the charts. But I do think one of the things that really makes him an incredible offensive player besides his mind and his passing is if you can get him the right spacing, he can get to spots on the floor. If he gets to those spots, you feel pretty good about the shots he\u2019s gonna put in. \u201cHe also, a lot of times from my perspective, bypasses a lot of shots. I wish he took more catch-and-shoot 3\u2019s at times. But what makes him an efficient shooter is he takes his shots. As a coach, I respect that. You never want to have a player feel like he\u2019s taking shots out of rhythm. Those 3\u2019s he made, he kind of sized up, got where he wanted to get and created some space and knocked them down. But he is an elite 3-point shooter.\u201d Clutch performer and \u201celite 3-point shooter,\u201d just two more titles for Paul, who has been president of the National Basketball Players Association since 2013 and a member of the executive committee since 2009. Paul also played integral roles in the NBA restart back in July, as well as the resumption of the postseason after the players staged a walkout in the aftermath of the Jacob Blake shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisc. https:\/\/twitter.com\/KingJames\/status\/1300642777978621953 For a man traded in July to Oklahoma City as part of a transaction that sent Westbrook to Houston, you\u2019d think Paul might be playing with some extra incentive to beat his former team. Paul shrugged off that notion. Instead, he discussed the reluctance OKC feels towards packing its bags to head back home. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s our team as a whole,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think it\u2019s because we do it by committee. We\u2019ve been in those situations all season long, so we just sort of thrive in it. When you are sort of on the ropes like that down 3-2, you\u2019ve got to pack and be ready for just in case you have to leave the next day. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready to go yet. Our team, we have had a memorable season, lots of ups and downs. We\u2019re just going to continue to fight. We wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d * * * Michael C.

The protestors in Atlanta chose Centennial Olympic Park, which is about a Trae Young 3-point shot from the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 arena, and born from this rumble was a method of action. That\u2019s how great ideas are generated anyway, through debate and conflict and exchange. And inspiration, too, which is what flowed through the veins and head of Steve Koonin right there and then. He\u2019s the CEO of the Hawks and a man whose mind never shuts off anyway, and the protest had Koonin buzzing from within. \u201cRight in the nexus of the protests, I\u2019m watching all the young people and the energy,\u201d he said from Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of peaceful demonstration, I think it\u2019s incredibly important. And I wanted to say that I understand what you\u2019re protesting but I don\u2019t know what could come of it because there was no contemplation of what the actions would be. \u201cThen it dawned on me that the only way to make change is to vote.\u201d Two months later, vote is the four-letter word everyone in the NBA is screaming \u2014 LeBron James wore a \u201cVote Or Die\u201d shirt at Monday\u2019s Lakers practice \u2014 while embracing the light bulb above Koonin\u2019s head that flashed this: Why not turn sports arenas into polling and voting centers for the November election? Suddenly, there\u2019s a massive snowball here in late summer. First, the Hawks and the city of Atlanta announced State Farm Arena would be such a site . Then, following more national unrest, NBA players just days ago put polling centers on their call-for-action list for social change . The swell of NBA arenas serving as polling and voting centers is now at 16, with the Bucks announcing plans to transform Fiserv Forum and the Pistons are donating their practice facility . Others are in progress. But, there\u2019s more: Other sports leagues are considering using football or baseball stadiums, and so this has become a movement within a movement. There are roughly 22 arenas and stadiums committed so far, and that\u2019s a fluid number. Chris Paul, president of the National Basketball Players Association, said: \u201cOne of the things we talked about as players is voting. Voting is something we\u2019re passionate about. We want all the NBA arenas to be polling sites. This is huge. For different cities that may not be able to do their arenas, maybe their practice facilities.\u201d The hope, of course, is for turnout at these arenas to be \u2026 a sellout crowd with standing-room only. \u201cI\u2019d always been appalled that `American Idol\u2019 had more voters than our presidency,\u201d Koonin said. The pandemic actually made this possible. Normally, arenas would be occupied the first Tuesday in November, especially if they\u2019re shared with hockey teams. Obviously the NBA and NHL pushed forward the start of their 2020-21 seasons well into winter, leaving those buildings dark, since all events, including concerts, were wiped out. The idea for the polling centers also caught fire among players because of their distaste for the current White House administration, which has never honored an NBA champion and whose policies are not embraced by the league or players. There\u2019s a shared desire, then, to motivate young people and those who normally don\u2019t vote to understand the urgency and get to the polls in greater numbers. Players don\u2019t come right out and say it, but they want a change in the White House. The need for a smoother voting system is dire in Georgia, charged in the recent past with voter suppression and a state that experienced chaos and national embarrassment during the state primary months ago. There were long lines at sites just to vote \u2014 some stretching for hours \u2014 and also a spotty high-tech voting system, a situation all made complicated by the pandemic. Fulton County, home to Atlanta and the state\u2019s most populous county, struggled to process a flood of absentee ballots and hastily arranged to cover a shortage of poll workers mere days before in-person voting. That was yet another reason Koonin pressed on. Not only did he and the Hawks propose the arena for this fall, but will staff it to help alleviate any snags or headaches. \u201cOur employees are going to work the polls,\u201d Koonin said. \u201cThey\u2019re young, digitally savvy, bringing high energy. We have incredible connectivity in our building; we were voted best technology in the NBA. We\u2019re in the large crowd business, too. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d Koonin was busy with Zoom conferences last week when he received word about the NBA players adopting his idea and demanding that their teams and cities make it mandatory . Milwaukee, home of the Bucks, who staged a one-game walkout after a police shooting in nearby Kenosha, signed up early, so did Detroit. And then came a rush: Sacramento, LA, Charlotte, etc. Koonin was floored. \u201cIt was a very nice feeling that an idea created had enough traction that people think it makes sense in their market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, `Whoa.\u2019 To be honest, it\u2019s amazing this hasn\u2019t been done before.\u201d Koonin fielded calls from other CEOs, arena managers and team governors about the magnitude and scope of arena transformation, such as cost, technology needed, equipment, staffing and also how to ensure safety during a pandemic. Should masks be required? Since these teams are competitive by nature, Koonin playfully engaged the Clippers and Warriors in a contest to see which arena registers the most voters. The winner will be awarded the John Lewis Good Trouble Cup, honoring the late Civil Rights leader and congressman, and the champion gets to keep the cup until the next election. Koonin spent the last few weeks trying to envision the scenario at State Farm Arena this fall and how it can roust citizens: Should the team stores be open, or pizza be served or a DJ spin music? In the end: \u201cWhat we decided to be was a library on steroids. This is a patriotic duty. We think of ourselves as election central. We\u2019ll have votes coming and and the results tabulated in the back of our arena. I\u2019m so optimistic. People are talking about this. There\u2019s a lot of awareness. We\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re staffed and ready for any and everything.\u201d How about using some of the Hawks as an incentive to get people in the building? Imagine the line wrapping around the block in L.A. and Brooklyn should LeBron or Kevin Durant serve as election hosts? \u201cIf our players want to come down and work the polls, and more than one has reached out, then we will train them,\u201d said Koonin. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be a side show.\u201d Regarding NBA players, Koonin said they should walk the walk regarding the election. Chris Paul recently made sure every player on the Thunder was registered to vote. \u201cI think every player on every team needs to be registered to vote for credibility,\u201d Koonin said. The importance of attracting young voters is the core of the NBA\u2019s efforts. It\u2019s a group that traditionally takes a pass at the polls, although given the social unrest and dissatisfaction with the current President in some corners, this could change in two months. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think their vote matters,\u201d Koonin said. \u201cThe problem is when you get a lot of people feeling the same way and millions don\u2019t vote, then you\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t matter. What we\u2019re trying to do with this is say, hey, there\u2019s no excuses. And make it cool. I\u2019m hopeful both young and old and people who haven\u2019t voted will come out and exercise that right.\u201d In a strange way, a return to health normalcy after this election would mean arenas and stadiums will get fans and the event schedule will begin to refill. Suddenly, those places won\u2019t have room for the polls anymore in future elections. \u201cOr maybe the NBA doesn\u2019t play on that day,\u201d said Koonin, \u201cand every building hosts something and it becomes a national holiday. Maybe we keep enforcing how important this is.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

"},{"id":25929,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-celtics-raptors-game-1","date":"2020-09-01","title":"Film Study: Celtics speeding up, staying ahead of Raptors' defense","content":" Moving from series to series in the playoffs doesn\u2019t just require a change in game plan on defense, where you may have to modify your scheme to slow down your new opponent\u2019s best players. A series change can also require a team to adjust offensively to more effectively attack how the new opponent defends. The Boston Celtics did just that in their Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Toronto Raptors. The Celtics were the best pull-up shooting team in the regular season, with four of the 28 players who finished with an effective field goal percentage of 50% or better on at least 100 pull-up jumpers, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Over their 72 regular season games, 56% of the Celtics\u2019 jumpers (the league\u2019s second-highest rate) were pull-ups rather than catch-and-shoot jumpers. That rate was higher (62%) as the Celtics swept the Sixers in the first round. Against a Philly defense designed to keep Joel Embiid near the rim , the Celtics ranked last in the first round in ball movement, averaging just 269 passes per 24 minutes of possession, according to Second Spectrum. But the Raptors\u2019 defense, which used ball pressure and relentless rotations to rank second in the league , requires a different approach. \u201cYou got to make sure you get rid of the ball on time in this series,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said before Game 1. \u201cIf you over-dribble, you\u2019re in trouble. Isolation is not the answer. They just load up on you, so the ball has to pop, you have to move, you have to find a great shot when you can, and you have to be patient enough to find it.\u201d There was a clip from the 2014 Finals where Tony Parker told Spurs coach Greg Popovich, \u201cI have to trust my teammates in this series.\u201d Because the Heat were blitzing pick-and-rolls, Parker knew he would have to \u201cget off the ball.\u201d When he drew two defenders, he had to get rid of the ball quickly so his teammates could play 4-on-3 before the Miami defense recovered. He did just that, sparking the best ball movement we\u2019ve seen in recent history. The Raptors are not blitzing the Celtics\u2019 pick-and-rolls. And Boston\u2019s ball movement on Sunday was nothing like that of the 2014 Spurs. But it was clear from the start of Game 1 that the Celtics\u2019 ball-handlers \u2014 Kemba Walker, in particular \u2014 knew they\u2019d have to get off the ball against the swarming Toronto defense. Walker\u2019s first touch of the series was on a hand-off from Daniel Theis, after which he was encircled by three Raptors: Fred VanVleet trailing the play, Marc Gasol (Theis\u2019 defender) up high to prevent the pull-up 3, and Pascal Siakam pinching off Jaylen Brown on the right wing: If Walker tries to drive, it\u2019s not just Gasol he has to deal with. \u201cWhen you drive the ball,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be hands in the gaps, there\u2019s going to be long arms in the gaps, swiping at every time you drive it.\u201d So Stevens wants Walker getting rid of the ball \u201con time.\u201d The attention he\u2019s getting from Gasol and Siakam has both Theis and Brown open for a quick pass. Here\u2019s that play and some other instances where Walker\u2019s ability to pass quickly produced good looks for his teammates: Play 1. Here\u2019s the play above. Walker takes the hand-off and quickly gets the ball back to Theis with a pocket pass. OG Anunoby sinks off of Marcus Smart to help on Theis, who kicks the ball out to Smart for the first of the Celtics\u2019 10 corner 3s. Play 2. Walker runs a pick-and-roll with Jayson Tatum (which the Raptors switch) on the right side of the floor. He quickly pitches the ball to Theis, who finds Tatum under the basket with a high-low pass over the 6-1 VanVleet. Tatum blows the layup, though. Play 3. Another pick-and-roll (this time with Theis) from the right side has VanVleet pinching off of Brown, who creates a little more space by sliding over to the left wing. Walker quickly gets him the ball and Brown drains a 3 before VanVleet can recover. Play 4. A high pick-and-roll has Ibaka up at the level of the screen. Robert Williams gets a clean roll to the rim (which Siakam fails to tag) and Walker hits him for a dunk Play 5. With the Raptors in a 2-3 zone, the Celtics run their double-drag screen for Walker, who gets the ball to Brown as soon as he pops open. Brown is able to attack the seam of the zone and get the defenders moving. When Walker gets the ball back, he attacks another seam and hits the relocated Brown for another corner 3. Play 6. A pick-and-pop produces a wide-open 3 for Tatum when Walker gets off the ball again. The Celtics\u2019 300 passes in Game 1 were 59 more than they had in any of their four games against Philly. Pace had a little to do with that, but their 310 passes per 24 minutes of possession was also a much higher rate than they had in any first-round game. After 56% of their regular-season jumpers and 62% of their first-round jumpers were pull-ups, the Celtics took more catch-and-shoot jumpers ( 27 ) than pull-up jumpers ( 26 ) on Sunday. They may have led the league in pull-up effective field goal percentage in the regular season, and shooting off the dribble is critical against most defenses in today\u2019s NBA. But every team shot more effectively on catch-and-shoot jumpers than they did on pull-ups, and the Raptors\u2019 defense is one that will give you some catch-and-shoot looks if you work for them. Habits can be hard to break and the Celtics didn\u2019t always get rid of the ball on time. There were occasions on Sunday \u2014 a pull-up mid-range from Walker , a Tatum drive through traffic , a Tatum step-back off an iso \u2014 when they were able to score off the dribble. But there were also times when they ran into trouble, because they held onto the ball too long. Play 1. Walker comes off a Theis screen, dribbles into the crowd, and gets the ball knocked out of his hands by Siakam. He\u2019s able to recover, but the possession turns into a Tatum iso vs. Kyle Lowry and a tough, mid-range shot late in the clock. Play 2. Tatum gets a screen from Theis and has open teammates on the wings, but keeps the ball, tries to draw a foul on Gasol, and chucks up an ugly shot. Play 3. Tatum has three defenders in front of him after he gets a screen from Williams, and Walker is open one pass away. But Tatum tries to back his way into a crowded paint, and his late pass to Williams sails out of bounds. Play 4. Walker rejects Williams\u2019 screen and runs into Lowry helping off the strong side corner. When he keeps dribbling, VanVleet recovers to take the ball away. \u201cThe pass is certainly king against the teams that can really get up into you, that really help, that are active with their hands\u201d Stevens said Monday. \u201cWhen we turned it over yesterday, a lot of it was when we had the ball too long. We\u2019ve just gotta make the right reads quickly.\u201d At the start of the fourth quarter on Sunday, with Serge Ibaka at the five, the Raptors were able to flatten the Celtics out a little by switching all ball screens for a few possessions. When Marc Gasol checked back in (and with Ibaka still on the floor), the Raptors went to their 2-3 zone. When they went back to man-to-man, they didn\u2019t switch ball-screens with Gasol. The Raptors had bigger issues on offense than they did on defense in Game 1, despite allowing the Celtics to make 10 corner 3s for the second time in August. Toronto\u2019s 94 points on 104 possessions was their third worst offensive performance of the season. But the Celtics were able to move the ball and find those open shots in the corners. Boston\u2019s film session on Monday should also have reinforced the benefits of getting rid of the ball quickly. So we could see more switching and\/or more zone from Toronto in Game 2 on Tuesday (5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). They weren\u2019t the No. 2 defense in the league without mixing things up quite a bit. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

This isn\u2019t to claim their 56-17 regular season record was fool\u2019s gold, somehow unworthy of the Bucks spot among the league\u2019s top championship contenders this year. All we\u2019re saying, all we got confirmation of again thanks to the Heat in Game 1, is that opponents no longer are afraid of the Bucks. Nobody\u2019s nervous about being shown up by Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s freakish athleticism. No one flinches if Milwaukee does go up big \u2014 the way it did to lead 40-29 after one quarter \u2014 because there\u2019s been a lot of elastic in those leads lately. So if the Bucks are going to fire back to beat Miami four times in the next six meetings, they will have to do so with little or no momentum, and no sense that one good game means a thing when it comes to the next. Miami might even be glad it\u2019s not facing Toronto or Boston in this round. The more a rival team can solve what you\u2019re doing, the more comfortable and confident it becomes. Comfort and confidence can lead to swagger, something the Heat showed in nailing down the series opener at The Field House on the Walt Disney World campus. Jimmy Butler swagged enough for them all, scoring 27 of his 40 points in the second half and 15 in the final quarter. Doing whatever he wanted in isolation plays, Butler was nearly flawless down the stretch, his aggressiveness putting to shame what had been the NBA\u2019s No. 1 defense in 2019-20. Butler probably didn\u2019t say a word to rattle the Bucks, either. He was cocky enough just talking to the guys on his side. During his takeover, Butler said, he knew he was feeling it and made sure they knew too. \u201cSay what you will, but I told my teammates I probably wasn\u2019t going to pass the ball,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI made a couple of shots and they said, \u2018That\u2019s fine with me.\u2019\u201d Closing time for Butler and the Heat, however, was made possible by what they did to dislodge the Bucks from some of their favorite basketball things. Milwaukee likes to shut down the lane and defy opponents to score from the perimeter? The Heat attacked into and through the paint, winning that turf battled 42-24. Defend without fouling? Nope, that didn\u2019t go the Bucks\u2019 way either. Miami shot 27 free throws and outscored them by 11 from the line. Butler (12-of-13) led the way on that, chipping away while Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton got into foul trouble that either cut into their minutes or fiddled with their style. Antetokounmpo put himself in a bind by picking up offensive fouls \u2014 he played only 15 minutes in the first half \u2014 and then made it all worse by missing eight-of-12 free throws when Miami sent him to the line. Much of that can change with the officials in Game 2, though Miami seemed always to have defenders between Antetokounmpo and the rim. The \u201cbuild a wall\u201d strategy is standard operating procedure now for Milwaukee\u2019s foes, one of the reasons the shock and awe has fizzled. In playoff series, coaches such as Toronto\u2019s Nick Nurse, Orlando\u2019s Steve Clifford and now Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra and their staffs have time to lock in that doesn\u2019t exist in the regular season. Heck, nobody\u2019s even getting on airplanes now. It\u2019s all film work, floor work and more film work. Middleton and Lopez carried the Bucks through Antetokounmpo\u2019s shaky first half, scoring 40 of their team\u2019s 63 points. But they combined for 12 the rest of the way, with Middleton wondering just what had him skidding sideways. \u201cI\u2019ve got to figure out what they did, what they changed, or if it was just me,\u201d he said. The Bucks sagged, too, because they played without point guard Eric Bledsoe, a late scratch with a strained right hamstring. Bledsoe has been an adventure the previous two postseasons, so there was no guarantee he\u2019d swing an 11-point outcome. But with 11 turnovers in the first half fueling 17 Miami points, the Bucks looked as if they missed the guy who normally starts their attacks. And considering Heat counterpart Goran Dragic\u2019s 27 points and romps inside, it\u2019s fair to think Bledsoe\u2019s all-NBA level defense would have helped. Antetokounmpo likely will play better, but for a night, his misleading numbers (18 points, 10 rebounds, nine assists) had less impact than the Heat\u2019s third-best guy. If was almost as if Bam Adebayo wanted to show the network TV audience that he should have finished first, not second to New Orleans\u2019 Brandon Ingram, in the Kia Most Improved Player award results announced Monday. Adebayo had 12 points, 17 boards and a slick six assists for Miami. Spoelstra publicly stayed humble and respectful following the victory, expecting a response from Milwaukee on Wednesday and giving away nothing of what the Heat did or might do. \u201cYou are who you are at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not cramming for a test or reinventing the wheel in the last two days.\u201d Miami does seem perfectly content, though, to challenge Milwaukee\u2019s etched-in-stone formula of taking, making and yielding 3-point shots. The Bucks were a better than usual 16-of-35 from deep, Heat sniper Duncan Robinson was only 1-of-4 and Spoelstra\u2019s team still won by double digits. So nothing to fear there, either.

A first-time NBA All-Star selection in his fourth season, the 22-year-old Ingram becomes the first player to win the Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award with New Orleans. The annual award is designed to honor an up-and-coming player who has made a dramatic improvement from the previous season or seasons.  Ingram received 42 first-place votes from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters and earned 326 total points. He edged Miami Heat center-forward Bam Adebayo, who finished in second place with 295 points (38 first-place votes). Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 finished in third place with 101 points (12 first-place votes). Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30-Aug. 14 as part of the season restart, did not count toward voting for the Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards.  From the beginning of the season through March 11, Ingram averaged 24.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.0 steal in 34.3 minutes in 56 games. He was one of seven players to average at least 24.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.0 steal, joining fellow 2020 NBA All-Stars Don\u010di\u0107, Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, James Harden and Russell Westbrook of the Houston Rockets, LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Kawhi Leonard of the LA Clippers. Ingram made 137 3-pointers in games played through March 11, which is more than he recorded in his first three seasons combined (127). He improved significantly at the free throw line, raising his accuracy to 85.8 percent this season (through March 11) from 66.2 percent across his first three seasons. Through March 11 this season, Ingram ranked 13th in the NBA in scoring average and posted the first two games of at least 40 points in his career, highlighted by a 49-point performance against the Utah Jazz on Jan. 16. He scored at least 30 points 11 times after totaling four 30-point games across his first three seasons. One of those 30-point efforts this season came during Week 10 (Dec. 23-29, 2019), when he was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for the first time in his career.  Ingram, who turns 23 on Sept. 2, was selected as a reserve for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game in his first season with New Orleans. The Pelicans acquired him on July 6, 2019, from the Lakers as part of a three-team trade that also included the Washington Wizards. Ingram, who was selected by Los Angeles with the No. 2 overall pick in NBA Draft 2016 presented by State Farm, averaged 18.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 0.54 steals in 33.8 minutes in 52 games with the Lakers last season.     The voting results for the 2019-20 Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award are below. The balloting was tabulated by the independent accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP. Complete ballots for each voter will be posted at pr.nba.com after the announcement of all end-of-season awards."},{"id":25946,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/georgetown-coach-john-thompson-dies","date":"2020-08-31","title":"Former Georgetown coach John Thompson dies at age 78","content":"John Thompson, the imposing Hall of Famer who turned Georgetown into a \u201cHoya Paranoia\u201d powerhouse and became the first Black coach to lead a team to the NCAA men\u2019s basketball championship, has died. He was 78. His death was announced in a family statement released by Georgetown on Monday. No details were disclosed. \u201cOur father was an inspiration to many and devoted his life to developing young people not simply on but, most importantly, off the basketball court. He is revered as a historic shepherd of the sport, dedicated to the welfare of his community above all else,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, for us, his greatest legacy remains as a father, grandfather, uncle, and friend. More than a coach, he was our foundation. More than a legend, he was the voice in our ear everyday.\u201d One of the most celebrated and polarizing figures in his sport, Thompson took over a moribund Georgetown program in the 1970s and molded it in his unique style into a perennial contender, culminating with a national championship team anchored by center Patrick Ewing in 1984. Georgetown reached two other title games with Thompson in charge and Ewing patrolling the paint, losing to Michael Jordan\u2019s North Carolina team in 1982 and to Villanova in 1985. At 6-foot-10, with an ever-present white towel slung over his shoulder, Thompson literally and figuratively towered over the Hoyas for decades, becoming a patriarch of sorts after he quit coaching in 1999. One of his sons, John Thompson III, was hired as Georgetown\u2019s coach in 2004. When the son was fired in 2017, the elder Thompson \u2014 known affectionately as \u201cBig John\u201d or \u201cPops\u201d to many \u2014 was at the news conference announcing Ewing as the successor. Along the way, Thompson said what he thought, shielded his players from the media and took positions that weren\u2019t always popular. He never shied away from sensitive topics \u2014 particularly the role of race in both sports and society \u2014 and he once famously walked off the court before a game to protest an NCAA rule because he felt it hurt minority athletes. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be remembered for all the things that kept me out of the Hall of Fame, ironically, more than for the things that got me into it,\u201d Thompson said on the day he was elected to the Hall in 1999. Thompson became coach of the Hoyas in 1972 and began remaking a team that was 3-23 the previous season. Over the next 27 years, he led Georgetown to 14 straight NCAA tournaments (1979-92), 24 consecutive postseason appearances (20 NCAA, 4 NIT), three Final Fours (1982, 1984, 1985) and won six Big East tournament championships. Employing a physical, defense-focused approach that frequently relied on a dominant center \u2014 Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo were among his other pupils \u2014 Thompson compiled a 596-239 record (.715 winning percentage). He had 26 players drafted by the NBA. One of his honors \u2014 his selection as coach of the U.S. team for the 1988 Olympics \u2014 had a sour ending when the Americans had to settle for the bronze medal. It was a result so disappointing that Thompson put himself on a sort of self-imposed leave at Georgetown for a while, coaching practices and games but leaving many other duties to his assistants. Off the court, Thompson was both a role model and a lightning rod. A stickler for academics, he kept a deflated basketball on his desk, a reminder to his players that a degree was a necessity because a career in basketball relied on a tenuous \u201cnine pounds of air.\u201d The school boasted that 76 of 78 players who played four seasons under Thompson received their degrees. He was a Black coach who recruited mostly Black players to a predominantly white Jesuit university in Washington, and Thompson never hesitated to speak out on behalf of his players. One of the most dramatic moments in Georgetown history came on Jan. 14, 1989, when he walked off the court to a standing ovation before the tipoff of a home game against Boston College, demonstrating in a most public way his displeasure against NCAA Proposition 42. The rule denied athletic scholarships to freshmen who didn\u2019t meet certain requirements, and Thompson said it was biased against underprivileged students. Opposition from Thompson, and others, led the NCAA to modify the rule. Thompson\u2019s most daring move came that same year, when he summoned notorious drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III for a meeting in the coach\u2019s office. Thompson warned Edmond to stop associating with Hoyas players and to leave them alone, using his respect in the Black community to become one of the few people to stare down Edmond and not face a reprisal. Though aware of his influence, Thompson did not take pride in becoming the first Black coach to take a team to the Final Four, and he let a room full of reporters know it when asked his feelings on the subject at a news conference in 1982. \u201cI resent the hell out of that question if it implies I am the first Black coach competent enough to take a team to the Final Four,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cOther Blacks have been denied the right in this country; coaches who have the ability. I don\u2019t take any pride in being the first Black coach in the Final Four. I find the question extremely offensive.\u201d Born Sept. 2, 1941, John R. Thompson Jr. grew up in Washington, D.C. His father was always working \u2014 on a farm in Maryland and later as a laborer in the city \u2014 and could neither read nor write. \u201cI never in my life saw my father\u2019s hands clean,\u201d Thompson told The Associated Press in 2007. \u201cNever. He\u2019d come home and scrub his hands with this ugly brown soap that looked like tar. I thought that was the color of his hands. When I was still coaching, kids would show up late for practice and I\u2019d (say) \u2026 \u2018My father got up every morning of his life at 5 a.m. to go to work. Without an alarm.\u2019\u201d Thompson\u2019s parents emphasized education, but he struggled in part of because of poor eyesight and labored in Catholic grammar school. He was moved to a segregated public school, had a growth spurt and became good enough at basketball to get into John Carroll, a Catholic high school, where he led the team to 55 consecutive victories and two city titles. He went to Providence College as one of the most touted basketball prospects in the country and led the Friars to the first NCAA bid in school history. He graduated in 1964 and played two seasons with Red Auerbach\u2019s Boston Celtics, earning a pair of championship rings as a sparingly used backup to Bill Russell. Thompson returned to Washington, got his master\u2019s degree in guidance and counseling from the University of the District of Columbia and went 122-28 over six seasons at St. Anthony\u2019s before accepting the job at Georgetown, an elite school that had relatively few Black students. Faculty and students rallied around him after a bedsheet with racist words was hung inside the school\u2019s gym before a game during the 1974-75 season. Thompson sheltered his players with closed practices, tightly controlled media access and a prohibition on interviews with freshmen in their first semester \u2014 a restriction that still stands for Georgetown\u2019s basketball team. Combined with Thompson\u2019s flashes of emotion and his players\u2019 rough-and-tumble style of play, it wasn\u2019t long before the words \u201cHoya Paranoia\u201d came to epitomize the new era of basketball on the Hilltop campus. Georgetown lost the 1982 NCAA championship game when Fred Brown mistakenly passed the ball to North Carolina\u2019s James Worthy in the game\u2019s final seconds. Two years later, Ewing led an 84-75 win over Houston in the title game. The Hoyas were on the verge of a repeat the following year when they were stunned in the championship game by coach Rollie Massimino\u2019s Villanova team in one of the biggest upsets in tournament history. Success allowed Thompson to rake in money through endorsements, but he ran afoul of his Georgetown bosses when he applied for a gambling license for a business venture in Nevada in 1995. Thompson, who liked playing the slot machines in Las Vegas, reluctantly dropped the application after the university president objected. Centers Ewing, Mourning and Mutombo turned Georgetown into \u201cBig Man U\u201d under Thompson, although his last superstar was guard Allen Iverson, who in 1996 also became the first player under Thompson to leave school early for the NBA draft. \u201cThanks for Saving My Life Coach,\u201d Iverson wrote at the start of an Instagram post Monday with photos of the pair. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, but I\u2019m sure that you are looking down on us with a big smile. I would give anything just for one more phone call from you only to hear you say, \u2018Hey MF\u2019, then we would talk about everything except basketball. \u201cMay you always Rest in Paradise, where there is no pain or suffering. I will always see your face in my mind, hoping that I made you proud. \u2018Your Prodigal Son\u2019.\u201d \u201cVery sad news to wake up to on this cloudy morning,\u201d Mutombo shared on Instagram . \u201cOur legendary Georgetown coach, John Thompson has passed away. He was my mentor, great teacher, hero and a father figure to so many us who got the chance to play for him. Under coach Thompson, I learned a lot about the game of basketball but most importantly, I learned how to be a man in society. We will really miss him. RIP coach.\u201d \u201cGeorgetown University, the sport of basketball and the world has lost someone who I consider to be a father figure, confidant and role model,\u201d Ewing shared on Twitter. \u201cWe will all miss you, Coach Thompson \u2013 but we will never forget you.\u201d The Hoyas teams in the 1990s never came close to matching the achievements of the 1980s, and Thompson\u2019s era came to a surprising and sudden end when he resigned in the middle of the 1998-99 season, citing distractions from a pending divorce. Thompson didn\u2019t fade from the limelight. He became a sports radio talk show host and a TV and radio game analyst, joining the very profession he had frustrated so often as a coach. He loosened up, allowing the public to see his lighter side, but he remained pointed and combative when a topic mattered to him. A torch was passed in 2004, when John Thompson III became Georgetown\u2019s coach. The younger Thompson, with \u201cPops\u201d often watching from the stands or sitting in the back of the room for news conferences, returned the Hoyas to the Final Four in 2007. Another son, Ronny Thompson, was head coach for one season at Ball State and is now a TV analyst. * * * Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":25922,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-bucks-fiserv-forum-voting-site-2020-official-release","date":"2020-08-31","title":"Fiserv Forum to serve as early voting site for 2020 general election in Milwaukee","content":" MILWAUKEE  \u2014 Fiserv Forum, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 state-of-the-art downtown arena, will serve as an early voting site for the 2020 general election. From Oct. 20 through Nov. 1, the City of Milwaukee announced today that voters may cast their ballots in-person at Fiserv Forum for the Nov. 3 election. \u201cWe are excited that Fiserv Forum will be designated an early vote site,\u201d said Milwaukee Bucks Senior Vice President Alex Lasry. \u201cThe pandemic has added another barrier to voting for vulnerable communities, so this will help us make sure that everyone in Milwaukee has a safe and convenient way to exercise their right to vote. By converting Fiserv Forum into a voting location, we can make sure everyone\u2019s voice can be heard in a safe and responsible way.\u201d In addition to Fiserv Forum, it was also announced today that the Milwaukee Brewers will open Miller Park for early drive through voting for the 2020 general election. Milwaukee\u2019s NBA and MLB teams opening their facilities to the public will help meet the increased demand for early voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiserv Forum will not only help meet that demand but will allow voters to cast their ballot indoors while maintaining appropriate social distancing to comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s safety guidelines. \u201cWe are now fortunate to announce that not only have we found one, but we have found two locations that are absolutely fabulous for allowing more people to exercise their right to vote,\u201d said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. \u201cNationally, Milwaukee has become the leader by providing both Fiserv Forum and Miller Park for early voting. I don\u2019t know of another city in this nation that is using a major league ballpark and an NBA arena for early voting\u2014 that\u2019s how committed we are to making sure that people\u2019s voices are heard.\u201d The announcement was made today at a press conference on the plaza at Fiserv Forum by Barrett, Lasry, Milwaukee Common Council President Cavalier Johnson, Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg and Milwaukee Brewers Director of Business Communications Leslie Stachowiak. \u201cVoting is sacred. It\u2019s the most important thing that we as citizens do in a democracy,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cWhen we vote, we determine who is going to be the person, or people, who represent us. Not just that, we\u2019re determining who is going to set the tone for our nation, for our city, for our state. We\u2019re determining who is going to set the laws for our society, and that\u2019s critically important to do.\u201d \u201cEvery eligible voter in this country has the right to vote and has the right to vote safely,\u201d said Woodall-Vogg. \u201cWhile voting by mail is without a doubt the safest option, it\u2019s not the best option for every voter. We had a 3% rejection rate in April due to things like ballots not being returned on time, or not having the right signatures. Being able to cast your absentee ballot ahead of Election Day, but with my staff, ensures that your vote counts and that we don\u2019t have a 3% rejection rate on November 3.\u201d Between Oct. 20 through Nov. 1, Fiserv Forum will be open to in-person early voting from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. through 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

The white and teal uniforms were updated in 2017 when Jordan Brand became the Hornets\u2019 uniform provider, but this marks the first full redesign since the Hornets brand returned in 2014. The new uniforms feature double pinstripes on the jersey, reminiscent of the second iteration of uniforms worn by the original Charlotte Hornets from 1997-2002, though the pinstripes are all one color in the new version. This is part of an effort to evolve the look through the use of a monochromatic design that incorporates only the team\u2019s traditional primary colors of teal, purple and white. The white Association Edition features teal elements with purple accents, while the teal Icon Edition has white elements with purple accents. The Association Edition jersey says \u201cCharlotte\u201d on the chest in teal and has teal numbers, all of which are in the team\u2019s current font and are outlined in purple. The anthem decoration above the tag says \u201cHornets\u201d in purple, while the neck and arm openings are teal. The Icon Edition jersey says \u201cHornets\u201d on the chest in white and has white numbers, all of which are in the team\u2019s current font and are outlined in purple. The anthem decoration above the tag says \u201cCharlotte\u201d in purple, while the neck and arm openings are white. The shorts for each have a double line of the contrasting color on each side that opens into a cell pattern on the outside of the leg that contains a secondary \u201cSilhouette\u201d logo in purple. The waistband and leg openings are also in the contrasting color, with the Association Edition having a new \u201cH-cell\u201d logo in white on the teal waistband and the Icon Edition having a new \u201cC-cell\u201d logo in teal on the white waistband. Like all of the team\u2019s uniforms, the new Association and Icon Editions feature the logos of Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand on the right chest and partner LendingTree on the left chest. The Official Loan Shopping Partner of the Charlotte Hornets, LendingTree\u2019s logo will appear on each of the team\u2019s jerseys for the fourth consecutive season. As part of a robust sponsorship package, the company is also the entitlement partner for the Hornets App, a social media content series and the Hornets Hoops youth basketball program. The new Association and Icon Edition uniforms are an evolution of the Hornets\u2019 uniform history. The design weaves together the lineage of previous uniforms in a way that is fierce, yet formal, while also drawing on the purity and essence of the game of basketball. The new look is streamlined to be more bold, symbolic and unified in order to present a modern and relevant take on the storied basketball tradition of Charlotte and the Carolinas. As with the team\u2019s prior uniforms, the new Association and Icon Editions were designed in a collaboration between the Hornets, RARE Design, Jordan Brand and the NBA\u2019s Global Merchandising Group. The Association and Icon Edition jerseys are expected to be available at retail on October 1. In addition to the new uniforms, the Hornets unveiled a new court for the 2020-21 season as well."},{"id":25974,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-family-arrives-bubble","date":"2020-08-31","title":"Disney World Diary: Players reunite with families on campus","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Today is family day at Disney and normally that would be a typical day, with parents towing kids and vice versa to rides and restaurants and taking pictures with life-sized cartoon characters. But of course these aren\u2019t normal times, and \u201cfamily day\u201d here means players will finally be reunited with their significant others and kids for the first time since arriving at this basketball campus months ago. After serving time in quarantine, those family members will be released into the arms of the player they came to see. The mood of the players should improve drastically. Paul George mentioned his troubling mental health and how being away from his family played a part in that. I\u2019ll be happy for him, and for all the players, but understand I said \u201cplayers\u201d because they\u2019re the only ones enjoying this privilege. For the rest of us, meaning coaches, health testers, referees, administrators, general managers, technicians, security and yes, the media, we won\u2019t get that long-awaited embrace. Today is just another day for several hundred people inside the ecosystem. I\u2019m reminded of the movie \u201cGladiator\u201d where Maximus, after helping to save Rome, just wants to be freed from military duty so he can return to the countryside to his wife and son. I definitely get it. The players are the show, the reason we\u2019re here, and their presence at Disney was dependent on seeing family once September approached. Besides, if that perk was extended to everyone, the campus couldn\u2019t support the enormity. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t miss my family after 55 straight days and a ritual that finally came to an end: Seeing my daughter off to school. It began years ago with a short walk from home to pre-K, hand in hand, a nervous father and an unsure toddler, ready to enter an unknown world. She was excited at first with the idea of spending a day with other kids, but once she realized I was going home and she was staying in class, she became frightened, ran toward me and wouldn\u2019t let go of my leg. Parents can relate. That was a \u201cmoment\u201d you never forget. The next year, same thing, although the leg-clinging wasn\u2019t as firm. The following year, she just waved good-bye. I always took pictures of every \u201cfirst day,\u201d all the way to high school, when she became slightly embarrassed because teenagers are like that, but traditions are traditions and so she had to strike the pose while her friends watched and giggled. And then, the big one: College drop-off day. To prepare, I wrote her a letter, described how much her childhood meant to us parents, how proud we were that she made it this far, gave her advice on how to navigate college, told her to find herself. Then after that teary hug goodbye, I handed her that letter and drove away. For the next two autumns \u2014 she would graduate from Baylor University in three years \u2014 I did the drop-off thing just to help with boxes and luggage and the move-in process. Last year, same thing, only at the University of Georgia, where she started graduate work. Last week, as she began her final year of the grad program and final year in school, her father was in Orlando interviewing basketball players who would soon be reunited with their kids. I\u2019m sure Victoria understands; she dealt with my frequent absences much of her life, although I didn\u2019t miss many of her track meets and did watch her become All-America in the sport. But we didn\u2019t finish what we started, a ritual that bonds a family and creates everlasting memories, a tradition that didn\u2019t end quite right. There will never be another first day of school for us. But we will see each other soon. And because she\u2019s now almost six feet tall, the hug won\u2019t involve a leg. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The more pressing question is, will either defense be up to the task for a winner-take-all affair when the Denver Nuggets and the Utah Jazz meet for the final time Tuesday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC ) in their first-round Western Conference series? Through six games, Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray and Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell have turned this into an individual shootout, something to savor over the past two weeks as well as a glimpse of a rivalry that might endure for many seasons. The flip side is that neither the Nuggets nor the Jazz have done much to tamp down all their gaudy numbers. Mitchell has been carrying Utah with 38.7 points, 4.3 rebounds and 5.5 assists, posting a pair of 50-point performances as the Jazz opened a 3-1 lead in the series. But Murray has been better lately, getting 50 points Sunday on the heels of his 42 in Game 5 to get Denver back to even, forcing the bubble-bursting finale for one of their teams. Mitchell, by the way, still scored 44 in the 119-107 loss, the second blown opportunity for the No. 6 Jazz to put away No. 3 Denver. No wonder Mitchell batted around a chair as he left the court at the end. No wonder his teammate Rudy Gobert kicked another chair after some blown defensive coverages midway through the fourth quarter. Of the 251 teams in playoff history that have led 3-1 in a best-of-seven series, only 11 have failed to win. Recent evidence suggests Utah is about to become the 12th. \u201cNobody\u2019s down. We\u2019re just [ticked] off because that was a winnable game,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cNo one\u2019s down at all. We\u2019ve got one more game. If we\u2019re down now then we\u2019ve already lost Game 7. There were things we could do to win this game.\u201d Offensively, the Jazz have an excuse, though none of them has mentioned it: Bojan Bogdanovic, their second-leading scorer before the virus shutdown (20.2 ppg, 41.4 3-point percentage), had surgery on his right wrist in May and was lost for the restart. They have missed him as a secondary threat to Mitchell, with each bucket now harder for the third-year combo guard. Those extra degrees of difficulty showed themselves Sunday in an abundance of isolation plays, with too little player cuts or ball movement. Defensively, though, is where Utah took a step or two backward from its diligence earlier in the series. Mostly that meant allowing Murray \u2013 who has scored 142 points in the past three games \u2013 to play free and easy, to go where he wanted with the basketball and to find his rhythm without disruption. Utah generally eschewed double teams or traps against Murray, relying on Joe Ingles, Royce O\u2019Neal, Mitchell and others to try to do individually what clearly required two. Never mind not cutting the head off this Denver snake \u2013 the Jazz might as well have grabbed it by the tail, for all the good those defensive choices did. \u201cWell, last game, he got to the rim. And we wanted to take that away,\u201d Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cOther than trapping him, we\u2019re trying to make him hit contested shots. And he\u2019s doing that. There were times in the game when we did try to trap him or hit him and get the ball out of his hands. But he\u2019s playing terrific basketball.\u201d Murray was quiet in the third quarter, scoring only four points. But that\u2019s when he got three of his assists, making sure that Denver center Nikola Jokic kept going. The Nuggets won the quarter anyway, 27-21, and then it was back to Murray for 21 points in the fourth. The fourth-year scorer from Kentucky has made 57.4 percent of his 3-pointers in the series, shooting 58.5 percent overall, so it\u2019s understandable that coach Michael Malone feels he is running out of superlatives to toss Murray\u2019s way. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to have been around some great players \u2013 LeBron [James], CP [Chris Paul], Steph Curry, Klay Thompson \u2013 but I\u2019ve never seen a guy go 50, 42 and 50,\u201d the Nuggets coach said. \u201cAnd two of those games being elimination games. \u201cTalk about a young man putting a team on his back. And that will to win, to do whatever is necessary to find a way to get the win. And to do it \u2013 we haven\u2019t played since Tuesday \u2013 with everything that has taken place in the the last three, four days. All the emotions, all the raw emotions, makes it that much more impressive.\u201d Murray has been one of the most active Nuggets in the NBA players\u2019 protests against police brutality, using his shoes to deliver messages Sunday. He also has been one of the most affected by it all: the restrictions within the Disney bubble, the tension and the need to use the platform of the playoffs to deliver messages that included a three-day pause in scheduled games. \u201cI played with a lot of heart, I played with a lot of passion,\u201d Murray told reporters afterward. \u201cWhen you fight for something it means a whole lot more. I go out there and fight for something, win or lose.\u201d Mitchell talked about various small failings in Game 6 that added up to the rather large loss for Utah. Boxing out better on long rebounds, clogging lanes to the rim, getting into their men early in each Denver possession \u2013 he saw plenty to clean up. But making each trip up the court less comfortable for Murray \u2013 maybe start with any \u2013 has to be the Jazz\u2019s priority Tuesday. That or packing. After Denver\u2019s victory and a passionate on-court postgame interview, Murray was caught on camera, alone as he walked up a ramp to the Nuggets\u2019 locker room. He knelt at one point, exhausted from everything on the court and off over the past several days. He looked like Utah\u2019s defense probably felt, pushed to a place they never wanted to be. \u201cAs a fan you want Game 7. We didn\u2019t want that,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty upset because we had things under control and we let it slip. We feel like we could have had this series, but they didn\u2019t want to go home. Now we don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Not after the show he put on in the first playoff series of his NBA career against the Los Angeles Clippers. He\u2019s a breathtaking young talent destined for great things in his career. But like so many other stars that have faced Kawhi Leonard in the past, the charismatic Doncic and his Dallas Mavericks are headed home. Leonard closed the Mavericks out Sunday, finishing them off with his career-best fifth-straight 30-point game in a 111-97 Game 6 win to take the series 4-2. It doesn\u2019t matter the uniform, the conference, the opponent or the venue. When Leonard is locked in and everything\u2019s on the line, the man his coach and teammates like to refer to as \u201cMr. Reliable\u201d lives up to that billing \u2026 as he did on Sunday. Leonard, the reigning Finals MVP and a two-time winner of that honor, closed the door on a late fourth-quarter Mavericks rally with all the clutch shots and winning plays needed to secure his team\u2019s ticket to a conference semifinal matchup against winner of Utah-Denver, which the Jazz led 3-2 entering Sunday\u2019s Game 6. T he Clippers needed everything Leonard could provide to move on, and he delivered with 33 points, 14 rebounds, seven assists and five steals. Leonard is the first player since Gary Payton in 2000 with 30-plus points, 10-plus rebounds, 5 assists and 5 steals in a playoff game. And he was ruthlessly efficient when it mattered most: he shot 9-for-10 from the floor in the second half, finally breaking the Mavericks\u2019 will in what turned out to be a much tougher series than most expected. \u201cYou could tell he was the one guy used to closing out series,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cHe was calm. He got us in plays. During games you fall on a set, right. And we fell on that little elbow set for him and just took what was there. If they came he scored and if they didn\u2019t come he made the right pass. I said it before the game, I think I was talking to P.J. Carlesimo and I was telling him, the one thing I didn\u2019t know \u2026 I knew he could pass and I knew he may be a good passer. But I didn\u2019t know he was an elite passer. And that\u2019s something you don\u2019t know until you coach a guy.\u201d What Rivers knew well before the Clippers pursued and landed Leonard in free agency last summer, was that he was the type of player whose stone-faced demeanor and no-nonsense approach to the task at hand was the championship component they were missing. He put that on display at the highest level in San Antonio, where he won his first Finals MVP in 2014, and last season in Toronto, when he collected his second in leading the Raptors to a Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in his lone season with the franchise. Leonard led the Clippers on and off the floor in what was a wild five-day stretch between Games 5 and 6 of the series. The season seemed on the brink Wednesday after the Milwaukee Bucks didn\u2019t take the floor for Game 5 of their Eastern Conference series against Orlando in protest of yet another police shooting of an unarmed black man, this time Jacob Blake \u2014 just 40 minutes south of Milwaukee in Kenosha, Wisconsin. When all of the players on campus met that night and again Thursday morning to discuss whether or not to continue the playoffs of pack up and go home in protest, the usually soft-spoken Leonard spoke loudest for the Clippers, the same way he did with the game on the line Sunday. \u201c[Kawhi] is a man of business. He stepped up and stepped in and time after time, whenever we needed him, he put us on his back. He finished the series,\u201d said Clippers All-Star Paul George, the other half of last summer\u2019s fruitful summer offseason bounty for the franchise. \u201cI can\u2019t say it enough, after this series he is the most reliable guy. His shot-making, just his time on \u2026 just awareness plays, he\u2019s just one of a kind. \u201cAnd yeah, everybody knows [Kawhi] is a man of few words, But when he speaks it\u2019s coming from a great place. And he\u2019s going to get his point across. His demeanor was felt and his presence was felt, you know, he was powerful in those meetings.\u201d This Clippers team is still working through some of the issues any elite team has in finding its form. Rivers rarely had his full roster healthy and available during the regular season before the March 11 shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic. And he didn\u2019t have it intact when the season restarted in Orlando with eight seeding games before the playoffs began. Having gone through the journey several times before, Leonard understands the importance of being measured and methodical in his approach. No matter how crazy the moment might seem, that method allows him to lock in at that moment. \u201cI guess just being here before, you know what I mean, just knowing it\u2019s going to take the [full] 48 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cI always say that just play even-keeled out there. We just gotta keep fighting. This is playoff basketball and everything is not going to go your way. You\u2019re going to have downs and ups and you just gotta keep playing,\u201d Doncic and the Mavericks forced the Clippers to stretch themselves to the limit through the first four games of the series. He ripped the Clippers for 42 points in Game 1, an NBA record for points in a playoff debut, and scored 28 points in 28 minutes in a Game 2 win to even the series. Doncic finished with a triple-double in a Game 3 loss and then erupted for a 43-point, 17-rebound, 13-assist triple-double and the step-back, game-winning 3-pointer at the overtime buzzer of Game 4. Doncic averaged 31 points, 9.8 rebounds and 8.7 assists for the series, playing on a left ankle he sprained early in Game 3 and without Kristaps Porzingis (torn meniscus in his right knee) in the final three games of the series. He got under the Clippers\u2019 skin up until the very end; Marcus Morris was ejected with 1:07 to play in the first quarter Sunday for a Flagrant 2 foul on Doncic, who finished with 38 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists while rallying the Mavericks from a 23-point deficit to within six points in the final minutes Sunday. Leonard closed the show. But Doncic also earned Leonard\u2019s respect. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cHis first playoffs, he battled every minute he was out there on the floor. DIdn\u2019t back down and led his team every game. He did a hell of a job out there.\u201d Rivers said he\u2019s had a \u201cman-crush\u201d on Doncic since he first set eyes on his game his rookie season. This postseason only strengthens that feeling. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle heaped even more praise on his young star, saying Doncic is \u201cone of the toughest players I\u2019ve ever seen in this league \u2014 and that\u2019s going back 35, 36 years.\u201d Again, Doncic was brilliant and at times breathtakingly so. But in the end, Leonard\u2019s championship-level steady was better. Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The shots didn\u2019t fall, the defense wasn\u2019t as sharp as it\u2019s consistently been throughout this season, and both ends of the floor were tied together in a wire-to-wire 112-94 defeat at the hands of the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals . This has been a difficult and unprecedented week for the defending champs. After completing the first playoff series sweep in franchise history, the Raptors dealt with anguish and frustration in the wake of another Black man being shot by police, hinting at the idea of a player strike 24 hours before the Milwaukee Bucks decided not to play Game 5 of their first-round series. A three-day break from basketball produced additional commitments from the league and its players toward improving racial equality. But getting back to a postseason mindset was not easy. \u201cWe all felt that emotionally,\u201d Kyle Lowry said Sunday. \u201cIt hit us hard. Today we just didn\u2019t play well.\u201d The Raptors missed some shots that they were making in the first round. They made defensive mistakes that cost them. But the Celtics were in the same situation in regard to the week\u2019s events. They executed better on Sunday, and they\u2019re now 4-1 against Raptors this season, including two convincing wins in Orlando. And after the second of those defeats, the Raptors weren\u2019t making excuses. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball,\u201d Pascal Siakam said. \u201cYou are out there, you play. This is something that we love to do, have been doing it for a while. Obviously it\u2019s tough and you don\u2019t want to minimize the things that\u2019s going on. But once we step on the floor it\u2019s time to play and we\u2019ve got to do our best.\u201d They were not at their best in Game 1. But there are reasons on both ends of the floor to believe why this is also a bad matchup for the champs. The Raptors are at their best when they run. They led both the regular season (18.8) and the first round (18.5) in fast break points per game. But they haven\u2019t been able to run against the Celtics. Their five games against Boston account for five of the 20 times this season in which the Raptors have been held to 13 or fewer fast break points. In Game 1 on Sunday, they had just seven. League-wide, effective field goal percentage is highest in the first six seconds of the shot clock. In the regular season, the Raptors had the league\u2019s sixth-biggest differential between their effective field goal percentage in the first six seconds (61.7%, fifth) and their effective field goal percentage thereafter (51.6%, 19th). Siakam was the primary example of the Raptors\u2019 transition-vs.-half-court dichotomy, with a differential (65.7% vs. 47.4%) more than double the league average. And on Sunday, he didn\u2019t get any shots in the first six seconds of the shot clock, finishing with 13 points on 5-for-16 from the floor. Eleven of Siakam\u2019s 16 shot\u2019s came in the paint, but only two of those 11 came in the restricted area, and there\u2019s a big difference between those and shots that come from six or seven feet away (and are generally contested). The All-Star had a couple of post-up scores ( one , two ) against Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown midway through the third quarter, but those were followed by a pair of awkward and off-balance misses ( one , two ) against Semi Ojeleye. \u201cI think I got to where I wanted to,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to finish some of the shots that I took.\u201d Siakam isn\u2019t the only Raptor who struggled on Sunday. After averaging 21.3 points on an effective field goal percentage of 70% in the first round, Fred VanVleet shot 3-for-16 in Game 1 of the conference semis. But the guard is going to generate his own looks off the dribble more than Siakam, who\u2019s postseason effective field goal percentage of 43.2% ranks 52nd among 56 players with at least 50 field goal attempts . To help him break out, the Raptors will have to see if they can give Siakam more space to operate in Game 2. \u201cI think we\u2019ll always look at trying to get him involved in about all areas,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said, \u201cas a post-up player, as a jump shooter, as a handler in the screen-and-roll, as a setter in the screen-and-roll. I think we\u2019ve got to mix it up and vary it, even some isolations on top, isos on the side, hopefully get him involved in the transition game a little bit as well.\u201d The Celtics won\u2019t make the transition game come easy, though. \u201cThey\u2019re getting a lot of bodies back, really quickly and really well,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cEven on turnovers, just change of possession, whether it\u2019s a defensive rebound or a turnover, they\u2019re getting a lot of bodies back.\u201d There have been 13 instances of a team making 10 or more corner 3s in a game this season. Two of those 13 have been Boston against Toronto in Orlando. The Celtics were 10-for-15 from the corners in their Aug. 7 (wire-to-wire) seeding-game win, and they were 10-for-15 from the corners again on Sunday. The Raptors were 2-for-6 from the corners, so they were outscored 30-6 on corner 3s and were a plus-6 from elsewhere on the floor. \u201cThere was some mistakes that we made to give some of those up,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThere was a couple of really blatant ones. There was a couple where guys were bottled up and we just ran to double-team for some reason, and left the corner 3 guy out there.\u201d One of those breakdowns came from VanVleet, leaving Brad Wanamaker to double Jayson Tatum and holding the double-team after Tatum had picked up his dribble. There were additional issues with Siakam leaving his man in the corner (both on the weak side and the strong side) to zone up (both in and outside the paint)\u2026 The Raptors are in their 2-3 zone on the first of those possessions, when the Celtics did a good job of getting into the paint and collapsing the zone, with Kemba Walker finding the relocated Jaylen Brown in the corner. But Toronto is playing man-to-man on the other three possessions, with Siakam having little regard for Marcus Smart in the corner. Smart was just a 33% shooter ( 21-for-63 ) from the corners in the regular season and a team shooting 10-for-15 from any spot outside of five feet is not sustainable. But even if you ignore the success rate, 15 corner 3-point attempts is not a good number for the defense. The Raptors allowed a league-high 4.7 corner 3s per game in the regular season (no other team allowed more than 3.6). Not only was the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from 3-point range (44%) the league\u2019s highest rate, the percentage of their opponents\u2019 3-point attempts that came from the corners (32%) was also the league\u2019s highest rate. They had the league\u2019s second-ranked defense because they protected the paint and forced turnovers, but they have a weak spot on that end of the floor. The Celtics know this, they know that the Raptors are aggressive on the ball, and they know where to look for the open man. \u201cI know they ran some stuff to set up some of the corner 3 stuff,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cAnd not only did it get them the shot, they were hittin\u2019 \u2019em in the heart.\u201d The Raptors can certainly clean up a few of those defensive mistakes in Game 2 on Tuesday (5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). On the same end of the floor, the Celtics will look to clean up their turnovers. They committed 23 in Game 1, with 10 of the 21 being live balls. Nurse, of course, sees those as lost opportunites to run. Credit Boston for stifling the Toronto transition game, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Raptors will stop trying to get easy baskets early in the clock. \u201cWhen you want to play in transition,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cyou got to run a little harder, and push the ball a little better, and throw it ahead a little bit more, and be just a little bit more aggressive.\u201d In their half-court offense, the Raptors could try some inverted pick-and-rolls in an effort to get Walker switched onto Siakam, though Boston has been very good at scrambling out of bad matchups. It\u2019s probably too early for a lineup change, even though the Toronto starters were outscored by 11 points in less than 15 minutes . Nurse played Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol together for almost nine minutes (their fourth highest total of the season) in Game 1, but the Raptors were unable to punish the Celtics on the glass, registering just seven offensive rebounds, despite missing 53 shots. Before trying a lineup change, Nurse will probably want to see how his team plays with more energy than they had in Game 1 \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say about characterizing that game as far as adjustments and stuff go,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cObviously we were not ourselves and I think more we are going to have to play a lot better, especially at the offensive end.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

He\u2019s the heartbeat of the Heat and this is evident here in practice, not just the games. Butler can\u2019t turn himself off. His personality is apparent and infectious. He can be playful and irritating, comforting and prodding, challenging and understanding. He is all that because that\u2019s what Miami wanted when it signed Butler last summer, looking for him to be himself and energize a team trying to transition into a title contender. \u201cBest decision I ever made,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI belong here.\u201d The feeling is mutual. His Heat teammates, especially the younger ones, gravitate to Butler, and in that sense, Butler has never felt more at home or this wanted in his NBA career. Through stops that led him to Chicago and Minnesota and Philly, Butler never felt quite right, and there were uneasy episodes in those places, mainly because Butler believed he wanted to win more than anyone else. He\u2019s now at an intersection \u2014 Jimmy Buckets is in his prime at age 30 and feels this stop is his best, if not last chance, to make a lasting statement. A 6-foot-7 guard from humble beginnings \u2014 no one ever thought he\u2019d make it this far in basketball \u2014 Butler gets respect for his inspired and emotional effort on both ends, always willing to accept the toughest defensive assignment and also take the biggest shot. He\u2019s averaging 19.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.5 steals in these playoffs, and now come the Milwaukee Bucks. Butler\u2019s play against the top-seeded team in the East will be paramount to Miami\u2019s chances of advancing to the conference finals. On the eve of the series which begins Monday , Butler agreed to an interview, covering a variety of subjects, even \u2026 Hall and Oates? * * * Question: Before we get into basketball, let\u2019s get into beer, and specifically the commercial that\u2019s getting heavy TV airplay during the playoffs. This is your first national advertising opportunity. How\u2019d it come about? Butler: I like to get behind brands that I enjoy, and we do drink Michelob Ultra around my household. Me and my boys drink it, me and my dad, everybody. So it\u2019s kind of a thing with us. When they became a sponsor with the league, I jumped at the chance. Me and my production company started filming around my house. It all made sense. Everybody loves the commercials from what I hear. The feedback\u2019s been great. Q: The commercial\u2019s theme song that you sing is \u201cYou Make My Dreams Come True\u201d while you\u2019re packing for the trip to Orlando for the playoffs. Be honest: How much Hall and Oates is on your personal playlist? A: I actually had this song! And also \u201cStep Brothers\u201d which is one of my favorites. So I already knew the lyrics to it which made it easier to sing. I\u2019m being serious. Q: Speaking of serious, we know you on the basketball court as a fierce competitor who never breaks expression. Do you think the commercial shows a different side of you? A: Definitely. And that\u2019s what I try to explain and get across to everybody, about who I am outside of basketball. You know the a-hole, quote-unquote, I can be out there on the court. But I\u2019m telling you, off the court, I would like to think I\u2019m as fun as anybody else. I just think that\u2019s a part of what (the commercial) is all about. I\u2019m singing all the time on the bench. When we\u2019re not competing at a high level, I\u2019m singing all the time. That just shows you who Jimmy Butler is as a person. Q: Last question on the commercial: You\u2019re pulling some cowboy boots from the closet. That\u2019s some symbolism and a salute to your roots, correct? A: That\u2019s another part of me. I\u2019m from Texas. I love being a Texas boy. I take pride in that. There\u2019s always some part of Texas that\u2019s in my household, whether it be some clothing, boots, a steak in the refrigerator. I love being from Texas, proud to be from Tomball, just outside of Houston. Q: You had a choice to go anywhere in the NBA last summer as a free agent and instead of staying in Philly with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, you came here. Why\u2019s that? A: There\u2019s this one player who played here, Dwyane Wade, he had a hell of a career here. He always told me the culture, the way that they work here, it\u2019s you in every single way. Well, I never thought I\u2019d leave Chicago. Then I realized this is a business and I ended up leaving to two other stops. It didn\u2019t work out in Philly. But when I got here I could do nothing but smile, because of the way everyone talks to each other, the way everything is laid out on the table, you come in and work and then we have fun. This is the reason I play the game. These guys are like me in so many ways that I absolutely love being here, to compete with and for these guys. I\u2019m having so much fun. Q: Do you have a way of sizing up teammates, as you did in your previous stops, to know if they\u2019re prepared to play on your competitive level? A: I don\u2019t have to size them up. I know. I can look in your eyes and tell if you\u2019re ready. I know what\u2019s going on with you mentally. Out here on the court, every single day, you\u2019ve got to give your all, 100 percent. When we\u2019re in a film session, everybody\u2019s talking, so you get a feel for these guys. I can talk to them and give some constructive criticism and they can talk to me. There\u2019s no going behind somebody\u2019s back. Q: Are you constantly in the ear of a particular player? A: I\u2019m in everybody\u2019s corner. Take Kendrick Nunn. He went from playing a lot as a rookie during the season and all of a sudden during the playoffs he wasn\u2019t playing. But everybody tells him, \u2018We\u2019re going to need you.\u2019 He knows we need him. So he kept working. He did that. He stayed ready. Q: Your teammates in the past, especially in Minnesota, probably took your approach the wrong way? A: Man, I care. And we should all care. That\u2019s why I fit in here. They got me to be me. I\u2019ll get on guys when they\u2019re not doing their jobs and they\u2019ll cuss me out when I\u2019m not doing mine. It\u2019s not personal. It may not always come out that way but I mean well. That\u2019s how they want it here. Q: Who was your Jimmy Butler early in your career? A: Adrian Griffin. Always telling me my rookie year, you gotta stay ready. Constantly making sure I was ready even when I wasn\u2019t playing much. I wouldn\u2019t be the player I am today without him. Always making me work. Q: You and Nunn and Duncan Robinson and Derrick Jones Jr. are long-shot players who weren\u2019t drafted high and in the case of those three, not drafted at all. Is there a shared determination that you have? A: The Miami Heat look for those diamonds in the rough, players that are hungry, players that got some dog in them and play for one another. These guys do what it takes to be here in the league for a while. Q: Do the playoffs bring out a different side of you? A: This is where you play your best basketball. It may not be scoring or getting an assist. It could be anything. That\u2019s what I try to do. My coaches and teammates know I\u2019m capable of making that happen. This is the time to really hoop, when I play at my best. I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to win. I would like to think that I\u2019m a winning player. I haven\u2019t won what I want to win yet, but I\u2019m not a loser. Q: Do you believe you\u2019re overlooked by the public at large? A: I don\u2019t need an MVP. I don\u2019t care about anybody\u2019s opinion. No trophy means anything except the Larry O\u2019Brien. I want to be a champion, man. I mean that. I think we can do something special here. Q: How do you tell your teammates, some of them still developing, to keep a future-is-now mindset? A: Look at what we had in Philly and how that didn\u2019t go anywhere, and before you know it, they\u2019re not in the playoffs anymore. Some guys\u2019 career can go this way or that way. Life works in a weird way so you never take anything for granted. So when you have something, you roll with it. Right now. You don\u2019t wait for two years or five years or for a draft pick. You win now and I think that\u2019s what the Miami Heat is all about, right now. Q: You tried to make a social justice statement by wearing a jersey without a name on the back. The league rejected that. Your thoughts? A: As players and famous people we\u2019re judged favorably because of who we are. But if I wasn\u2019t where I am today, I\u2019d be no different than any man of color walking down the street. That was really the meaning behind it, what I was trying to get across. Q: What should we expect from you and the Heat here in the next round? A: Our best. My best. We\u2019re here to win. Now we\u2019ll see what happens. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

The Lakers were the 1 seed having found their footing with wins in Games 2, 3 and 4. The Blazers were the 8 seed missing their best player, with Damian Lillard having suffered a right knee injury in Game 4. The Lakers ultimately took care of business with a 131-122 victory . But the game wasn\u2019t in hand until L.A. went on a 15-2 run in the final few minutes. After allowing the shorthanded Blazers to match them with 68 points on 56 possessions in the first half (when none of the L.A. guards could contain CJ McCollum), the Lakers played just enough defense in the final 24 minutes to advance to the conference semifinals. LeBron James (36 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists) and Anthony Davis (43, nine and four) combined for 79 points on a ridiculous 28-for-37 shooting, just as effective from the outside as they were in the paint. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going to get the majority of the looks,\u201d James said afterward, \u201cbut at the same time, we just want to be efficient with our looks. We don\u2019t want to take bad shots. We want to get great shots. And I think tonight was one of those instances where we didn\u2019t settle much. When we had our shot, we took it. When we had our drives, we took it.\u201d The matchup advantages they had against the Blazers won\u2019t be so pronounced going forward, this will be the worst defense the Lakers face in these playoffs, and the perimeter shooting won\u2019t stay *so hot. But the duo of James and Davis will continue to win games with their unmatched size and skill. *James, a 35% 3-point shooter in the regular season, shot 12-for-20 from beyond the arc over the last three games. Over the same stretch, Davis, a 35% mid-range shooter in the regular season, shot 14-for-17 (82%) from mid-range. The Lakers head into a conference semifinals series against the Houston Rockets or Oklahoma City Thunder, with Houston having taken a 3-2 series lead earlier on Saturday. The Rockets were the only Western Conference team with a winning record (2-1) against the Lakers and Russell Westbrook (38.0 points per game in two games) was the leading scorer against L.A in the regular season. Every matchup is different and the competition is about to get much more difficult, but the Lakers are obviously in a better place than they were 10 days ago. After really struggling offensively through the seeding games and Game 1 of this series, they put things together in Games 2-5. Here are a few more numbers to know about the Lakers after the franchise\u2019s first playoff series win in eight years. 34.3% \u2014 Lakers\u2019 3-point percentage in the series. After Saturday\u2019s games, five teams have advanced to the conference semifinals and another three (all in the West) have 3-2 series leads. The Lakers, with Portland having shot 37.9% from beyond the arc, are the only one of those eight teams that didn\u2019t shoot (or haven\u2019t shot) better than their first-round opponent from 3-point range . The Lakers did shoot 22 more 3-pointers than the Blazers in the series. So they outscored Portland by six total points from beyond the arc. But the series was won in the paint, where the Lakers outscored the Blazers by 11.6 points per game . This is who the Lakers are. It\u2019s been written in this space that the Lakers had the biggest differential between how well they shot in the paint (best in the league) and how effectively they shot outside it (bottom five). But their defense also played a role in the points-in-the-paint differential in this series. From the regular season to the first round, the Blazers saw a big drop in their field goal percentage in the paint (from 54.5% to 50.0%) and a smaller drop in the percentage of their shots that came in the paint (from 45% to 44%). With the last two being the Blazers\u2019 most efficient games of the series , the Lakers dropped from first to fifth in defensive efficiency in the first round. But for the series, the Blazers scored 9.1 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did in the regular season (104.1 vs. 113.2). And with that being the biggest drop among the 16 playoff teams, you can make the argument that the Lakers have had the best defense in the playoffs thus far. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to have a defensive plan where you have to double as much as we had to double in this series,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into that, both corralling the man on the ball and covering things on the back side. We prefer not to double when we don\u2019t have to. \u201cBy doing so as much as we did in this series, it really sharpened us to making sure we\u2019re covering all those areas. I think it definitely improved us. Knowing what they\u2019re capable of kept the sense of urgency throughout the series. We said coming into this that if we\u2019re able to beat the Blazers, that them being such a powerhouse offense is going to help us in later rounds. And hopefully, that\u2019s the case.\u201d 41% \u2014 Percentage of Davis\u2019 minutes that came with JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard off the floor. The playoffs can often make a team abandon what it\u2019s been doing all season. But this series did not elicit more small-ball from the Lakers. (James and Davis at the 4 and 5 is not that small, but you get the idea.) In the regular season, 40% of Davis\u2019 minutes were played at the five, with both McGee and Howard off the floor. In the first round, that percentage barely budged. The Blazers did play Jusuf Nurkic and Hassan Whiteside together for 54 total minutes in the series. But they abandoned that look after the first five minutes of Game 4 and the opponents\u2019 size didn\u2019t really affect Vogel\u2019s rotation. Interestingly, playing big was better offensively for the Lakers, while playing small was better defensively: \u2022 In 97 minutes with Davis on the floor with either McGee or Howard , the Lakers scored 126 points per 100 possessions and allowed 109. \u2022 In 66 minutes with Davis at center , the Lakers scored 111 points per 100 possessions and allowed just 82. Those numbers parallel Davis\u2019 at-the-4-or-5 on-court numbers from the regular season. Better offense playing big, better defense playing small. A series against Houston would obviously be a fascinating chess match in regard to the Lakers\u2019 lineups. The Rockets won both meetings after they committed to small-ball, but both James and McGee sat out the Aug. 6 game they played in Orlando . When the two teams met in February, the Lakers were a plus-6 in 16 minutes with Davis on the floor with McGee or Howard and a minus-10 in 24 minutes with Davis at the five. There\u2019s certainly an argument for trying to bully the Rockets inside and sacrificing some mobility on defense. +20.2 \u2014 Lakers point differential per 100 possessions with Alex Caruso on the floor. Another question for the Lakers going forward: Who\u2019s the back-up point guard? They\u2019re hoping to get Rajon Rondo back soon. But Caruso gave them great minutes off the bench against Portland. That +20.2 with Caruso on the floor is the fifth best mark among 101 players who\u2019ve averaged at least 20 minutes in these playoffs. (Davis has the fourth best mark at +22.5.) His pick-and-roll play with Davis fueled a couple of important runs in Game 3, and the Lakers\u2019 defense has been at its best , allowing 90.9 points per 100 possessions, with Caruso on the floor. (There\u2019s a link between that number and the better defense with Davis at center.) Houston would be a very different matchup. On defense, Caruso would be tasked with defending bigger and stronger guards than those of the Blazers. And on offense, the Rockets\u2019 switch-everything scheme would make it tougher for him to get into the paint and make plays. Caruso\u2019s one weakness is his perimeter shooting, and he was just 3-for-15 from 3-point range in the Portland series. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

This is what the basketball GPS says as the playoffs, after a two-day delay, creep toward the second round because the threats to disrupt an anticipated Lakers vs. Clippers showdown in the Western Conference finals, much like the coronavirus tests here at Disney, are negative so far. That\u2019s not only great news for L.A., but beyond area code 213. A basketball universe and TV audience is craving a La-La series that would drown out all others, maybe even the subsequent NBA Finals. Obviously, not everyone\u2019s thrilled in Portland and Dallas, where the Blazers and Mavericks put up the good fight. And what\u2019s cruel is these two persistent teams, when all\u2019s said and done, might be the toughest tests the Clippers and Lakers will see in the conference playoffs, other than each other. Wasn\u2019t it just last week when the first round for both L.A. teams began to quake? Damian Lillard delivered the greatest August in NBA history and Luka Doncic took the elevator up in his next-level development into a superstar. The healthy Blazers weren\u2019t your ordinary No. 8 seed and the Mavericks had two stars to match the Clippers and suddenly the small chance for high drama had snuck through security and infiltrated the NBA campus. But the Clippers recalibrated and are up 3-2 on the limping Mavericks, seeking to deliver the KO on Sunday. And the Lakers are back to being beasts again, seizing advantage of Lillard pulling up lame with a knee sprain to bounce the Blazers back to Portland. LeBron James and Anthony Davis combined for 79 points in Saturday\u2019s series-clinching victory . Assuming there are no serious setbacks with the Clippers during their closeout attempt of Luka and the Mavs, all of L.A. can do a collective exhale. \u201cListen, we\u2019ve just got to come out and play and play well \u2026 when you add that to execution and game planning and following the game plan and effort, you have a better chance,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers.  With all NBA playoff teams readjusting following what Rivers termed \u201ca break\u201d caused by the players\u2019 desire to double-down on the social justice message, the Clippers reject any idea of them losing focus during that process. \u201cWe have a championship mindset here,\u201d said guard Pat Beverley. They present a stark contrast to Dallas at the moment. The Mavericks are grabbing body parts while reaching for hope. Kristaps Porzingis is a scratch because of a lateral meniscus tear of his right knee. Doncic bravely rescued Dallas for one epic game without Porzingis, then he and the Mavs floated back to earth after surrendering 153 points in Game 5 and now Doncic lacks a strong co-star to bring to the fight. Playing against a deep Clippers team that could afford the disappearance of a player or two, the Mavs aren\u2019t getting any breaks on that front. This is where the endurance tests becomes a factor. Teams just can\u2019t afford any injuries, not even the tweaks. There simply isn\u2019t enough time for them to heal. Meanwhile, Kawhi Leonard is in playoff form, showing plenty of bounce off the dribble, especially when he backs down inside the lane for fallaway mid-range jumpers that are money. So far, he is everything the Clippers imagined when they signed him last summer. Kawhi is averaging 32.8 points on 52% shooting with 9.4 rebounds; he has done everything well except hit 3-pointers consistently. Better news for the Clippers: Paul George has been freed from the funk. He went through a stretch making just 10-of-47 shots, evaporating in key moments, passing up shots after a string of misses and having overall low impact on the floor against Dallas. George rallied with a 35-pointer to put the Clippers up in the series and later explained he wasn\u2019t in the best frame of mind, due partly to the confining nature of the NBA campus combined with his shooting issues. He said he spoke with the team\u2019s sports psychologists the last few days. He did add, however, that there was no thought given to leaving the campus, and with family members are on hand and set to reunite with the players, George will gain a support system. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t just going to cave in immediately,\u201d George said. \u201cIf it got severe, I think my team would have understood if I needed to walk away from this. But all it took was me seeking help and seeking advice, and starting from there, it helped. It put me in a different place. That\u2019s where the decision was made that I could continue to keep going, because of the help that I got. That\u2019s just where it started. It was just great advice all around, everyone telling me they feel the same way, just continue to be me, play my game. All of that helped, just their views and perspective and the way they view me. It kind of just changed my whole spirit.\u201d And here\u2019s the best news for the Clippers: We still haven\u2019t seen them at their best and full strength. Beverley is still dealing with a quad strain and there\u2019s no timetable for his return; and Montrezl Harrell remains rusty after missing the previous two weeks for his grandmother\u2019s passing and funeral. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of do we want to win a championship, because we do,\u201d said guard Landry Shamet. \u201cThat\u2019s all we think about. We\u2019re back locked in.\u201d The Lakers flexed for the fourth straight playoff game Saturday by eliminating the Blazers and demonstrating that most of their vital signs are positive. Coach Frank Vogel said the team has \u201cre-centered and refocused\u201d not only from the events of the last few days, but most of the season, including the death of Kobe Bryant. \u201cWe have a Ph.D in handling adversity,\u201d said Vogel. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much as a group this year. We\u2019ve been able to rely on those experiences as a group throughout the year. This is just the next in a long list of things that have happened to our group, so I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to get back to where we were.\u201d LeBron is averaging a triple-double in the playoffs to launch his pursuit of title No. 4, and the only nit-picky signals from Davis are a few stretches of disappearance now and then; otherwise, 31 points and 11 rebounds and two blocks per game ain\u2019t shabby. The 3-point shooting has stabilized for the Lakers after their collective 5-for-32 nightmare to open the playoffs. Once again, no matter how much basic production the Lakers might get from the supporting cast, and regardless if their distance shooting is spotty, LeBron and Davis can soothe plenty of aches. Next up for the L.A. teams are the survivors of the Rockets-Thunder and Jazz-Nuggets grudge matches. Even then, L.A. basketball gets a bit of a break. The Rockets, who just received Russell Westbrook\u2019s return, would be at a severe size disadvantage against the Lakers. Oklahoma City, on the other hand, would trail the Lakers badly in the superstar matchup, 0-2 (no disrespect to Chris Paul). Donovan Mitchell is bravely carrying the Jazz, although the Clippers tend to silence most scoring guards by tossing a trio of defenders (Kawhi, PG, Beverley) in that direction, and remember, Bojan Bogdanovic is out for the playoffs, depriving the Jazz of their second-best option. Meanwhile, the Nuggets are once again underachieving in the playoffs \u2014 their coach, Mike Malone, said his team must be \u201cmore mentally tough\u201d \u2014 and because they currently trail Utah, 3-2, a rally to win that series would tax them before they meet the Clippers. Make no mistake, this is the most unique playoff season and setting in NBA history. Although there are no major first-round surprises so far, anything\u2019s possible in the second round especially because there\u2019s no home court advantage. Plus, never dismiss the possibility of injuries, which have already disrupted teams, to spoil dreams. L.A. vs. L.A. is in development, though. The visibility of such a conference final would amplify the social justice platform and be a basketball ratings bump. LeBron, Kawhi, PG and AD on the same floor? The anticipation for that series wouldn\u2019t be confined to Los Angeles. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Rockets engineered a third-quarter slaughter Saturday in outscoring the Thunder 37-18 on the way to a lopsided 114-80 win and 3-2 series advantage in the Western Conference playoffs. Game 6: Rockets vs. Thunder (9 ET, TNT) But if you remember back to when Houston shot ahead 2-0 in this series, D\u2019Antoni crossed his arms and said it \u201cdidn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d So, it\u2019s no surprise his demeanor hadn\u2019t changed after this one. ( We won\u2019t tell him, but when a playoff series is tied 2-2, the Game 5 winner owns a record of 171-37 in series play.) \u201cThey\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a dog fight the next game, and then we\u2019ll see what happens. To close people out is one of the hardest things to do. We\u2019ve got to win the next game, and they\u2019ve got to win the next game. So, there will be no letting down, hopefully, on our side. There better not be. It doesn\u2019t matter. We just throw the records out. We\u2019re going to play one game Monday and try to win it.\u201d Here are four takeaways from the game: Based on the final score, it\u2019s tough to believe this was a three-point game at halftime. Houston led by as many as 13 points in the first half, but OKC scored 11 straight points in the second half of the second quarter and trailed at intermission just 48-45, despite its starters combining for just 21 points, thanks to the exploits of super sub Dennis Schroder (19 points on 6-of-12 shooting in the first half). But the Rockets would start out the second half on a 19-2 run to go up by 20 with 7:43 remaining in the third quarter. That wasn\u2019t even the killer. Fifty-two seconds later, P.J. Tucker set a screen with Schroder working to fight over the top of it. As Schroder collided with Tucker, the Thunder guard appeared to hit the Rockets wing in the groin with his right hand. Schroder then turned to speak with an official. Tucker walked up from behind and head-butted Schroder. Officials ejected both players, charging Schroder with a Flagrant 2 and Tucker with a technical. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a lot of different angles,\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cFirst thing was it was obviously an illegal screen, and it was kind of a bang-bang play. P.J., obviously, after the play was over kind of head-butted Dennis. I\u2019m not even gonna speculate or even [try] to read Dennis\u2019 mind. I think it was a bang-bang play. Dennis was trying to find a way to get around the screen, and he got hung up.\u201d Clearly, Oklahoma City suffered more than Houston from the double ejection, as Schroder finished as the Thunder\u2019s leading scorer, despite missing the rest of the third quarter and the entire fourth. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it,\u201d said James Harden, who scored a game-high 31 points on 8 of 14 from the floor and 6 of 11 from deep. \u201cBut P.J. wouldn\u2019t have reacted that way if it was nothing. That just gave us that extra boost to kind of play the right way and do what we were doing from the beginning of the game.\u201d OKC had overcome second half double-digit deficits to win Games 3 and 4, but after Schroder\u2019s ejection, it became clear the Thunder wouldn\u2019t have the firepower this time to mount a comeback. OKC\u2019s 80 points were its fewest in the bubble, not to mention the club\u2019s lowest-scoring postseason game since May 2014. Without Schroder\u2019s slashing ability and 3-point shooting to help for the majority of the second half, the Thunder set a franchise low for field goal percentage (31.5) for the game, and finished 7 of 46 from 3-point range. Returning from a strained right quadriceps, Westbrook played in his first game since Aug. 11, and as expected, the point guard appeared to be rusty. Westbrook shot just 3-of-13 from the field, but he dished seven assists in a little more than 23 minutes on the floor. The team entered the game planning to restrict Westbrook to between 20 and 25 minutes. So, Houston\u2019s huge second-half lead helped the team to accomplish that goal. D\u2019Antoni said he was pleased with \u201cthe rhythm he gives us, the speed. Then, James doesn\u2019t have to make every play. Russell was hitting guys early, getting good shots. We didn\u2019t make a lot of them. But we were getting good shots. He was creating really well. A guy of that stature, he\u2019s going to be important. So, we\u2019ve missed him.\u201d Most importantly, Westbrook came out of the game healthy, which could lead to an increase in minutes for Game 6. \u201cWe know what he brings to the table. He brought that energy,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHe brought that excitement that we were missing. We just need him. He\u2019s our leader, and we all know what he does for the game of basketball and our team. It was exciting to have him out there.\u201d It\u2019s worth pondering as Houston appeared to uncover a couple of glaring Oklahoma City vulnerabilities in Luguentz Dort on the offensive end of the floor and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on defense. At this point, Dort appears to be the Thunder\u2019s most pressing concern. For the most part, Dort has provided solid defense throughout this series on Harden. But offensively, Dort\u2019s ineffectiveness in this outing left OKC playing basically with four against five on offense. Throughout the game, Houston\u2019s defenders often left Dort open on the perimeter for wide-open shots. He couldn\u2019t take advantage, shooting 3 of 16 from the floor and missing all nine of his attempts from 3-point range. To his credit, Dort never showed any reluctance to shoot the ball despite those struggles. \u201cIt was great to see the guys supporting Lu in terms of encouraging him to shoot when he was open,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI think there were some that he hesitated on. I think part of his growth is understanding when to shoot some, when to drive, and when to pass some. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t have a very good offensive night. Those same shots were there in Game 4. He made a couple of them. He also made some big plays. None of us are perfect, but you\u2019re gonna get great effort from Lu. He just didn\u2019t shoot the ball well. Our whole team didn\u2019t shoot the ball well.\u201d It was definitely a rough night for OKC\u2019s vaunted three-guard lineup as Chris Paul and Gilgeous-Alexander finished minus-28 and minus-27, respectively, while Schroder was minus-1. \u201cLuckily, we talked about all this stuff before we got here. So, that\u2019s that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to drawing board, see what we did well, see what we didn\u2019t do well. Just about every game, the first play of the third quarter, they started off with a 3. So, we\u2019ve got to let our defense create our offense, and I think we\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d Donovan expressed concerns before the game about his team\u2019s rhythm after the league took a three-day break once the players staged a walkout in the wake of the Jacob Blake shooting. But for the most part, the league\u2019s latest hiatus provided a needed break emotionally, especially with the deaths of actor Chadwick Boseman, who starred in Black Panther, and former NBA standout Cliff Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to unpack,\u201d Paul said. \u201cChadwick was a special guy. I think everyone took it hard, especially in the black community. That was one of our Black superheroes. \u201cThat on top of everything, one of our brothers, at such a young age, at 53 years old. I remember being a kid watching Cliff Robinson, growing up and watching him play against Michael Jordan. All of this stuff happening. Jacob Blake is still on our mind day in and day out. \u201cTo be honest with you, it was nice to get out and play some. That\u2019s somewhat of our way to decompress and our outlet. All of the guys in our league, all of the players, we just want accountability. If we can get accountability for police officers just like ourselves, then I think that\u2019s a start.\u201d Harden thought the hiatus was important because \u201cthe world needed to know that we\u2019re involved with them. I think we needed a couple of days to sit back and reflect on what\u2019s going on in the world. We understand what\u2019s going on. Obviously, it\u2019s bigger than basketball.\u201d Added Westbrook: \u201cI think during times like this, sports [are] something that everybody at home right now, that\u2019s kind of all we have right now that\u2019s a positive and inspiring. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a pause and a break to be able to reset and actually take time to be able to make sure that our voices are heard as athletes; especially us African-American athletes. It\u2019s something that\u2019s very important, not just something that we can just have a conversation and move on.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The Bucks advance to face the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals . Here are t hree takeaways from the Bucks\u2019 series-clinching victory: By everything, I mean provide so much physicality and aggressiveness. A favorite to repeat as Kia Most Valuable Player, Antetokounmpo does do all the other stuff Milwaukee needs, from scoring to rebounding to passing to exhorting teammates from the sidelines when he plays his typical short minutes. But those minutes were held down in Game 5 by foul trouble, the result of contact at both ends. That can\u2019t continue in the next round, or the round after that if Milwaukee advances. Not if he and the Bucks expect to reach The Finals. There\u2019s no current NBA superstar who has to navigate whistles when he fails to modulate his intensity quite like Antetokounmpo. He fouled out of five games in the regular season and had to play another seven with five personals. Conspiracy theorists might contend that Antetokounmpo\u2019s profile is so high, and his value to audience share so great, that the officials will adjust how they ref his games. Milwaukee better not count on that. Even if his new Kia Defensive Player of the Year award gets him some slack, Antetokounmpo\u2019s defensive fouls aren\u2019t typically the problem. It\u2019s the ones he picks up at the other end, barreling into the \u201cwalls\u201d so rapidly erected in front of him or getting used by floppers the way D.J. Augustin did in Game 5. Until he gets full \u201csuperstar treatment\u201d around the league, he must avoid early or heavy foul trouble. Remember, the other three East teams that dropped first-round series now have coaching situations very much in flux. Philadelphia and Indiana fired Brett Brown and Nate McMillan, respectively, while Brooklyn considers interim guy Jacque Vaughn just another candidate in its search. Clifford should be free from that sort of stress after snagging Game 1 from the No. 1 seed and keeping his group focused and fighting back right up the series\u2019 20th quarter. Orlando went through this last spring, beating Toronto in the series opener before getting swept. But the Magic improved their numbers against the Bucks \u2014 a points differential of 9.2 vs. 14.4 against the Raptors, and a boost in offense (101.9 rating from 95.8 last year) while holding steady on defense (111.5 both series). Clifford\u2019s arrival two summers ago was met with a collective meh from a lot of Magic fans, who had hopes for a splashier hire. But neither Scott Skiles (2015-16) or Frank Vogel (2016-18) got a budding roster to the postseason, while Clifford has done it twice. Let\u2019s not forget, either, that Aaron Gordon, Michael Carter-Williams, Jonathan Isaac and Mo Bamba all were unavailable vs. the Bucks. Meanwhile, the development of young players is clear, none more than once-maligned, now-serviceable point guard Markelle Fultz, who just turned 22. The Bucks did more than take a bold stand for their community when they decided not to play Game 5 Wednesday as a protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha (about 30 miles south of Milwaukee). They risked alienating fans who disagreed with the move, and might have created a huge distraction for themselves from the basketball task at hand. It\u2019s an emotional time in an emotionally trying bubble environment. The Bucks, in the 72 hours from their decision not to play Wednesday till tipoff Saturday, arguably got more media attention than they had all season. Even with a limited on-site media gaggle, whether in person or on Zoom calls, the players and coach Mike Budenholzer suddenly had on their plates a whole lot more than Xs & Os and roster updates. What seems to have happened is that the decision the Bucks made to forfeit, walk out or (as it turned out when fellow NBA players joined in) simply postpone games actually has drawn them closer together. Not that they weren\u2019t a tight bunch prior to last weekend\u2019s shooting. But any growth they might feel as men, apart from beating the Magic or prepping for the Heat, could benefit them in their locker room and on the court. The Bucks played great, defensively stifling the Magic, dominating the paint, controlling the boards. They led by as much as 21, but had gas in the tank to pull away again late when Orlando got within six points. Most of all, in the stilted, artificial, repetitive world of the Disney bubble, they found a way to escape virtually and feel good about themselves, by addressing a social issue vital to them and to their franchise\u2019s city and state. Rather than derailing them, the team\u2019s stance might provide a little extra gravity and push to their championship pursuit. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But the Miami Heat aren\u2019t the Orlando Magic \u2014 not even close. Milwaukee and its fans like to think their team found itself after some mediocre play just before and early into the Disney bubble. Miami is tougher, more aggressive and more tireless in every way than Orlando. Its defense has the potential to take away, well, if not Milwaukee\u2019s first two scoring options, at least 1.5. Then there\u2019s the regular season results: Miami won two of three meetings, almost bracketing the \u201cnormal\u201d part of the season with impressive displays on Oct. 26 and March 2. (The Bucks won an Aug. 6 seeding game, but neither Jimmy Butler nor Goran Dragic participated.) The Heat are brimming with confidence and lofty ambition after their sweep of Indiana and some newly clicking lineup combos. The Bucks need to dial up their intensity and physical play, because this is a test that will either eliminate them or make them stronger. 1. Who guards Giannis Antetokounmpo? Any series with Milwaukee can swing based on the answer to this question. With Miami, the best option would appear to be Bam Adebayo. At 6-foot-9, the third-year forward and first-time All-Star in 2020 gives up a few inches to Antetokounmpo, but he has the energy, athleticism and defensive chops to bother the Bucks star for 24 seconds each time down. That might mean an undersized matchup at center, if Jae Crowder bodies up with Brook Lopez. But the opportunity to pester the Greek Freak with Adebayo and then Derrick Jones makes that the Heat\u2019s best option. 2. How will the extended layoff affect the Heat? By normal playoff standards, Miami going a week between games probably wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Happens all the time each spring, with the league and the TV networks trying to achieve maximum exposure and ratings. But the week between the Heat ousting Indiana and the opener of this series Monday will have been spent in the bubble, with no work\/home normalcy in play. And the emotions stirred up by the three-day protest postponement is also uncharted territory. Several Heat players told reporters the team has bonded through the layoff, and if that\u2019s the case, it might prevail over any staleness. 3. What\u2019s the key matchup? Jimmy Butler vs. Khris Middleton. Both these guys carry heavy responsibilities. Butler has proven to be Miami\u2019s go-to guy offensively, and even if he doesn\u2019t defensively draw the Bucks\u2019 No. 1 threat, making life miserable for their No. 2 weapon could isolate and overwork Antetokounmpo. Middleton sometimes treats his scoring role as a burden, and while he is solid defensively, it\u2019s a less physical style than Butler favors. A fair barometer for this series might be whichever guy outplays the other \u2014 Butler averaged 19.9 points, 6.7 rebounds and 6.0 assists this season, to Middleton\u2019s 20.9, 6.2 and 4.3 \u2014 will lead his team into the conference finals. 5:44 \u2014 After starting at power forward and guarding Giannis Antetokounmpo for 6:04 in the Heat\u2019s overtime victory over the Bucks in October, Bam Adebayo guarded the MVP favorite for just 5:44 over the final two regular-season meetings between these teams. In both of those games, Adebayo started at center, with Derrick Jones Jr. starting in the Heat\u2019s win in March and Kelly Olynyk starting in the Bucks\u2019 win in the restart (in which Adebayo dealt with foul trouble and played just 22 minutes). Having Adebayo defend Antetokounmpo would put Crowder on Brook Lopez, who was 3-for-3 with five free throw attempts with Crowder guarding him in the regular season. The Heat didn\u2019t start their current lineup \u2013 Goran Dragic, Duncan Robinson, Jimmy Butler, Crowder and Adebayo \u2013 in any of the three meetings against the Bucks, though it was a plus-6 in nine minutes in the March game. That lineup should be able to space the floor well against a Bucks\u2019 defense that will give up 3-pointers (no East team shot better against the Bucks from 3-point range this season than the Heat), though only three of its 17 field goal attempts in those nine minutes came from beyond the arc. \u2014 John Schuhmann Both these teams like to pack the paint and protect the rim, preferring any softness in their defense to come way outside. The Bucks have thrived doing that for two seasons, but Miami \u2014 with Duncan Robinson, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk, Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic \u2014 have serious deep threats to thwart that. Milwaukee\u2019s perimeter shooting is less reliable unless George Hill and Kyle Korver get longer minutes. The rest of the game, the Heat\u2019s toughness can dictate terms, especially if Antetokounmpo is picking up early offensive fouls. Still, the Bucks\u2019 growth and lessons in the 2019 postseason, and Antetokounmpo\u2019s peak powers, should be enough. Bucks in 7. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

I arrived at the arena 90 minutes before tipoff of Game 5 between the Milwaukee Bucks and Orlando Magic and everything felt normal. As I walked to my socially distant broadcast location, there were Bucks and Magic players on the arena floor going through individual workouts and our pregame meetings with the head coaches were business as usual. There was nothing that indicated that the game wouldn\u2019t start as intended that afternoon. With 20 minutes on the clock before tip, the Magic took the floor and there was no sign of the Bucks. It didn\u2019t register at first what was happening, but as the minutes started to tick by at what felt like rapid-fire pace, confusion built quickly. Our crew was now minutes away from going live on national TV and I was on the phone with my producer who was telling me to be ready for anything. I was looking at the arena floor where Monty McCutchen, the league\u2019s Vice President of Referee Development and Training huddled with the game refs, the Magic players started to halt their warmups, looking around in wonder like the rest of us. Behind me, several NBA league executives were having hushed conversations on cell phones. All the spark and energy usually felt at a playoff game evaporated instantly. All of us were aware that boycott discussions had taken place earlier that day, but I didn\u2019t see it coming that quickly. When the game clock struck zero and the ball was supposed to tip, the arena felt incredibly eerie. It was dark, cold, empty and felt so cavernous. No one was left on the floor except our television crew, while everyone else who was at the game was anxiously waiting outside of a closed Bucks locker room to see what was going to happen next. It\u2019s almost as though the atmosphere was a reflection of what my heart was feeling: dark and heavy. So many of my black colleagues, friends and underserved communities are hurting. This was way bigger than basketball. The social injustices need to stop. It was such a strange dichotomy because everyone at that game was professional beyond measure from NBA staff, to Bucks General Manager Jon Horst, to the broadcasters and so on, yet all of us were navigating a situation we had never seen before. It was so unprecedented. For me, my mind shifted instantly. I went into that game prepped to talk about Giannis Antetokounmpo winning Kia Defensive Player of the Year and now it was hard news and facts. I needed to get it right. I wanted to give justice to a moment that I knew was going to shift things, and I hoped for the better.  For the next couple hours, I gathered as much information as possible running between the Bucks locker room and the empty arena floor where we had a camera set up for live shots. We were relaying information to an audience that had quickly gone from NBA fans to Americans nationwide. My phone was blowing up from people all over the country telling me they were tuned into the events unfolding. Looking back, a last-minute decision by the Bucks was a brilliant one in that in place of a basketball game, both NBA TV and NBA on TNT were now talking about social injustice in a way that was real, raw, and changing by the second. A decision to sacrifice a playoff game made by the team that plays in the same state where Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back immediately grew into the NBA\u2019s most significant moment in the league\u2019s fight for social justice. One of the Bucks\u2019 players told me, \u201cpressure and accountability needed to be applied.\u201d Mission accomplished; the country was now standing in attention. Ultimately, the entire Bucks team exited the locker room and addressed the media. As they made a collective statement demanding systemic change, you could hear the sincerity, pain, strength, and resolve in the voices of George Hill and Sterling Brown who delivered the message. While it may seem I\u2019d look back on that day and be proud of helping tell such an important story, the feelings that resonate with me most right now are sadness and anger that we still don\u2019t have equality and peace. Why are innocent lives like George Floyd being taken just because his skin is darker than mine? Since arriving in the Bubble, what enrages me is the hateful and racially charged reactions I have seen across all social media platforms from people in response to Masai Ujiri\u2019s injustice, the Jacob Blake shooting, and now the Bucks\u2019 decision to sacrifice a playoff game. \u201cIt was Ujiri\u2019s fault that he was assaulted,\u201d \u201cBlake deserved to be shot,\u201d and \u201cthe Bucks are just whining.\u201d I could go for shock value and repeat some of the most vulgar comments I\u2019ve seen, but I\u2019d rather not give ignorance and hate a platform. I have never seen in color and maybe that\u2019s easy for me to say because I have never been marginalized for the color of my skin. Part of me thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t voice my opinion because I am white; I am not the one who is being directly affected by racism and injustice. I can only sympathize but not empathize with what Black people have been feeling for countless centuries. But I do feel the pain. I want to keep feeling the pain to every extent that I can until we replace racism with equality because I am human. I understand the difference between right and wrong. And what feels wrong to me right now is saying nothing at all. This is not a black person problem, this is a human problem. This is all of our problems until we see systemic change. I am proud of the Bucks for raising the bar on accountability. I am proud of the commitment from the NBA and the Players Association to create a social justice coalition and convert all 30 team arenas into voting locations for the 2020 general election before agreeing to resume play in Orlando. And as the playoff games restart this weekend and the NBA continues to speak from the heart and compete for a championship, I will keep feeling all of it, especially when it hurts the most. I will be here to listen, learn, support, and grow. Like Martin Luther King Jr. once said, I choose to \u201cshow justice, love kindness, and walk humbly.\u201d Today and every day, I choose to stand in solidarity.  * * * Rebecca Haarlow is a sideline reporter for Turner Sports.

Not bad for a guy who was warned he might not even get a second season in Storrs. \u201cHe averaged five points as a freshman and I remember I told him, \u2019You have two choices: I can kick you out if you keep doing what you do, or I\u2019m going to watch you play a lot of years in the NBA,\u2019\u201d former UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. \u201cHe chose the latter, which was good.\u201d Robinson died Saturday at 53, remembered as much for his personality as his skills by the teams he played for during an 18-year career. \u201cHis personality and energy were unmatched, and his contributions on the court were unmistakable, helping the Trail Blazers into the playoffs each of his eight seasons with the team,\u201d the Blazers said. \u201cHis streak of 461 consecutive games played with the Trail Blazers still stands as a franchise record, which is a testament to his hard work and dedication to the team. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Cliff\u2019s family and loved ones. Uncle Cliffy will be greatly missed by the Trail Blazers and all of Rip City.\u201d No cause of death was given, though Calhoun said Robinson had a stroke 2 1\/2 years ago. Shams Charania of The Athletic later reported a statement from the family that indicated Robinson had been battling lymphoma. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to hear of this, because he was one of my kids, my players, a guy I watched grow into a man,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing.\u201d Robinson helped the Blazers reach the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992. He not only never missed the postseason in Portland but hardly missed any games at all, playing all 82 in each of his first five seasons and never appearing in fewer than 75. \u201cRIP Clifford Robinson \u2013 some of my earliest memories of NBA basketball were of you as the lifeblood to those early\/mid 90\u2019s Blazers teams. The Memorial Coliseum days!! RIP to a Portland legend,\u201d tweeted Cleveland star Kevin Love , who grew up in Oregon. Clifford Robinson was born on Dec. 16, 1966, in Buffalo, New York. He was the centerpiece of Calhoun\u2019s early teams at UConn. He played in Storrs from 1985-89, helping guide the Huskies from the bottom of the Big East to the 1988 NIT championship. Robinson averaged just 5.6 points as a freshman but scored 20 a game as a senior before becoming a second-round pick of the Blazers. \u201cHe was our first great player,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cHe gave legitimacy to the program. \u201cAs a player coming in, here\u2019s this guy playing on TV for the Trail Blazers, watching him play, watching UConn being mentioned. You could not pay for the exposure that he gave us.\u201d Robinson was the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year in 1993 and made his lone All-Star appearance the following year. At 6-foot-11, he had the size of a center but was a skilled outside shooter. He played 1,380 games in the league, ranking in the top 15 all-time. Besides the Blazers, Robinson also played for Phoenix, Detroit, Golden State and the Nets. The Blazers took the floor Saturday wearing headbands in his honor. \u201cClifford was the consummate professional who loved the game and played with an incredible sense of both joy and intensity during his outstanding 18-year career, including two seasons with the Warriors,\u201d Golden State said. * * * Associated Press writer Pat Eaton-Robb in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report."},{"id":26025,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-preview-raptors-celtics","date":"2020-08-29","title":"Numbers preview: Toronto Raptors (2) vs. Boston Celtics (3)","content":" Having disposed of two other Atlantic Division teams in a pair sweeps, the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics are ready to face each other in the postseason for the first time ever.

Saturday\u2019s games open at 3:30 ET with Magic vs. Bucks on ESPN, followed by Thunder vs. Rockets (6:30, TNT) and Blazers vs. Lakers (9:30 ET, TNT) The joint statement issued by the NBA and NBPA read, in part, as follows: Play stopped Wednesday when the Milwaukee Bucks didn\u2019t take the court for their playoff game against Orlando, showing their frustration with the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin and acts of racial injustice. Games were postponed the last two days before a meeting between owners and players Thursday in which an agreement to resume was reached. All 13 teams still on the NBA\u2019s campus at Walt Disney World in Orlando are practicing today as the league announced a practice schedule for Aug. 28, which leads off with the Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat practicing from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and closes out with the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Orlando Magic and Portland Trail Blazers practicing last (3-6 p.m.). The WNBA, which postponed its games on Aug. 26, also postponed its games on Thursday night . Players across the NBA have been adamant that more needs to be done to effect social change after the recent police shooting of Blake in Kenosha, Wisc. The Milwaukee Bucks did not take the floor before the start of Game 5 against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, an action they later stated was due to the police shooting of Blake, subsequent civilian shootings of protestors and the lack of legal response to those and other national occurrences of social injustice that preceded them. After Wednesday night in Orlando at the Walt Disney World campus housing the season restart, players and owners met to discuss the state of the season. Multiple reports on Thursday confirmed the NBA\u2019s players had decided to resume the 2020 playoffs.

He continues to deal with a strained right quadriceps, but may soon be able to get into the series mix for Houston. Westbrook, expected to be upgraded to questionable for Game 5 against Oklahoma City, has been made \u201cavailable\u201d writes Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle . Earlier Friday, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni told reporters there were no decisions on any playing-time restrictions. The news was first reported by Mark Berman of KRIV-TV in Houston. In a bit of encouraging news for the Rockets, Westbrook went through full-speed, 5-on-5 action on Thursday and looked \u201cas explosive as ever,\u201d per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon and Adrian Wojnarowski. That marked his first action since being diagnosed with the quadriceps injury. D\u2019Antoni told reporters Tuesday that Westbrook is day-to-day with his quadriceps injury and he would not rule him out for the rest of the series. \u201cNot going to rule anything out or anything in,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Additionally, D\u2019Antoni told reporters it\u2019s up to the medical staff to decide when Westbrook is good to return. Oklahoma City\u2019s win tied the series 2-2, with Game 5 set for Wednesday night ( 6:30 ET, TNT ). Westbrook was ruled out for the start of first-round shortly after the seeding games portion of the 2019-20 season restart ended. Westbrook has been trying to play through the injury during the season restart. In a 110-102 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Aug. 4, he made just 5 of 12 free throws and finished with 15 points and nine assists; that snapped a streak of 36 straight games with at least 20 points. Westbrook missed the next two games with what was described as a right quadriceps contusion. Westbrook is averaging 27.2 points, 7.9 rebounds and 7.0 assists this season for Houston."},{"id":26121,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-return-finish-what-started","date":"2020-08-29","title":"Bucks return to practice, ready to finish what they started","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 It\u2019s pretty ironic how the Bucks brought the playoffs to screeching halt even without a prime-time slot in the first round, that they\u2019re the most famous team in pro sports right now for taking off-court action despite dominating the action all season. It\u2019s a complex, if not weird, situation for the team with the best record in the NBA and the reigning MVP \u2014 and he\u2019ll probably be given another award next month \u2014 yet here they are, hoping their basketball buzz will somehow and eventually match the one surrounding their social justice walkout. In the big picture, the Bucks will be fine with the history they made a few days ago if they fail to make history in October, when the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy is awarded. From Giannis Antetokounmpo to the last man on the bench, they felt a higher calling and a more meaningful purpose than gunning for a title. That\u2019s why they refused to continue their first-round series against the Magic, an action that pushed a domino and caused others to topple, not only on the Disney campus but across all other US sports. It was an emotional decision by the Bucks that seemed right, just as a more rational decision by NBA players to keep playing also seemed right. First: Why play a game when your head\u2019s in a fog, a distraction caused by a shooting in Kenosha, just down the road from Milwaukee? Second: Why pull the plug on the season and go home and lose your visibility and massive platform and cause financial problems for the league? Even Barack Obama reportedly felt the players needed to return to work. And now that basketball is back after what Clippers coach Doc Rivers termed \u201ca break we all needed,\u201d there are two purposes for being here: Continue the dialogue on racial injustice and political and police reform by using the setup provided by the league \u2026 and chase the championship. Can the Bucks, guilty of pushing for change, leave Disney with a pair of crowns? That would make them truly a team to remember, for all the obvious reasons: The season was interrupted by a pandemic, the playoffs are staged in an NBA ecosystem that robbed the Bucks of home-court advantage, and the swirling meteors of social injustice crashed to earth all around them, outside of Orlando. When baseball and soccer experienced shutdowns and statements were issued by teams from all four major sports, the fingerprints on those events belonged to the Bucks. They started something, for sure. But what will they finish? The Bucks shut down Friday, when NBA teams returned to practice. They declined all interviews and refused to explain in further detail their actions and what those actions caused across sports and in their home state of Wisconsin. \u201cAs we return to the court today, our team focus will be on our overall performance and well-being,\u201d the team said in a statement. That\u2019s somewhat fitting, since the Bucks flourished all season in relative silence. They were superior record-wise to LeBron James and the Lakers, Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers, the Celtics and the Sixers and the defending champion Raptors, but were hardly the darlings of TV or merchandise sales or social-media hot takes. Giannis is a 6-foot-10 force on both ends, just named Kia Defensive Player of the Year even as he ranks among the league leaders in scoring and rebounds. All without earning the same sparkle as LeBron and Luka Doncic, and probably not James Harden, either. The team is based in a small Midwestern town where the appeal is mainly confined to the city limits; beyond that, there are arguably more Bulls fans in Wisconsin, at least when the Bulls are winning. The Bucks thrive on 3-point shooting created by open looks produced by Giannis clear-outs. If those shots fall, the Bucks are formidable. If they also fall for Giannis, they\u2019re just about unbeatable. Their defense is elite, not only because of Giannis, but also Brook Lopez. Together they form a brick wall at the rim. And they\u2019re aided by quick guards who can cover the perimeter, starting with Eric Bledsoe. The rotation has largely been intact for the last few years, with the only noticeable defection being Malcolm Brogdon. That creates great chemistry and an understanding of how to compliment the towering presence of Giannis. Not every superstar is easy for teammates; Giannis is an exception because he doesn\u2019t dominate the ball or play heavy minutes. All told, the Bucks have those weapons along with great health in their favor. That\u2019s why they\u2019re firmly in the championship mix and perhaps the favorite, definitely the team to beat in the East. Now we\u2019ll see if their one-game walkout managed to clear their heads enough to allow them to refocus and justify their basketball reason for being in Orlando.

We are hopeful to resume games either Friday or Saturday,\u201d NBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said in a statement released Thursday . \u201cThere is a video  conference call meeting scheduled later this afternoon between a group of NBA players and team governors representing the 13 teams in Orlando, along with representatives from the National Basketball Players Association and the league office and NBA Labor Relations Committee Chairman Michael Jordan, to discuss next steps.\u201d The WNBA, which postponed its games on Aug. 26, is also postponing its games on Thursday night . Players across the NBA have been adamant that more needs to be done to effect social change after the recent police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisc. The Milwaukee Bucks did not take the floor before the start of Game 5 against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, an action they later stated was due to the police shooting of Blake, subsequent civilian shootings of protestors and the lack of legal response to those and other national occurrences of social injustice that preceded them. After Wednesday night in Orlando at the Walt Disney World campus housing the season restart, players and owners met to discuss the state of the season. Per multiple reports , the NBA\u2019s players decided Thursday to resume the 2020 playoffs.  On Wednesday afternoon, the NBA announced that the three games scheduled for Aug. 26 \u2014 Bucks vs. Magic, Rockets vs. Thunder and the Los Angeles Lakers vs. Portland Trail Blazers \u2014 were postponed . Each of those Game 5s will be rescheduled, per the NBA . Here\u2019s the latest news on this developing situation: https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBATV\/status\/1299130150349488128 > More news from yesterday\u2019s protest"},{"id":26068,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-playoffs-back-player-protest","date":"2020-08-28","title":"Back on: After full day of meetings, players hear enough to convince them to return to basketball","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Upon further review, the games will continue. A hectic 24 hours that included, in no specific order: A Bucks walkout, Michael Jordan, heated debates, the resounding voice of Doc Rivers, political demands, the NBA Board of Governors, reform demands, Zoom calls and a conclusive desire to finish what was started, all resulted in an about-face and overnight second thoughts that put the NBA playoffs back in play , which will get restarted on Saturday . The players who pressed pause on the season didn\u2019t get everything they wanted \u2014 improbable, considering the justice system doesn\u2019t move so swiftly \u2014 but enough to convince them that returning to basketball and the platform afforded to them at the Walt Disney World campus made the most sense. And here we are, with the restart of the restart seemingly set for Saturday. If the intention of the Bucks and other playoff teams was to use their two-day refusal to play to stay on message and make it resonate, then mission accomplished \u2026 with an exclamation. The brotherhood in pro sports took notice and followed the lead as games in other leagues were canceled or postponed across America. Heaps of praise came in a downpour from many corners, all saluting NBA players for their awareness. The conversation about systemic racism and police misconduct was instantly raised and it thrust the NBA into the mainstream, not only here but worldwide. The most progressive sports league and its players once again became leaders in that regard. Yet the players weren\u2019t satisfied. They wanted something actionable. They pressed the league governors on other issues, mainly asking \u2014 demanding? \u2014 them to reform their own behavior regarding political contributions, social justice programs, voter registration, community presence and applying pressure to local governments to force action on issues the players feel are roadblocks and deterrents to progress. Here\u2019s what the players wanted that wasn\u2019t accomplished: Legislation change that would lead to faster arrests in Kenosha, Wisc., and Louisville, Ky., and other places where Black men were shot by police. That would\u2019ve required them to sit out this season and maybe even a portion of next season, which in hindsight was a false hope by the Bucks when they listed their reasons for skipping Wednesday\u2019s first-round playoff game with the Orlando Magic. Also, there was considerable debate among players about the action the Bucks took by skipping that game. Those players claimed they were blindsided \u2014 clearly, the Magic didn\u2019t know because they took the court for pregame warm-ups \u2014 and were annoyed by Milwaukee\u2019s neglect to consult them. In addition, a segment of players in a meeting Wednesday night were reportedly against walking out on the season, putting them at odds with others who were receptive to that. Oklahoma City guard Chris Paul, the president of the National Basketball Players Association, lobbied Rivers to address the room. Rivers has been the face of social justice in Orlando, speaking emotionally and smartly about police reform and systemic racism, so he was invited. Rivers was in favor of saving the playoffs and listed his reasons for that, while also urging players to get ownership more involved with issues in a show of force. \u201cThey wanted me to talk and I really didn\u2019t want to talk, I just wanted it to be a player\u2019s thing,\u201d the Clippers coach told Fox Sports West . \u201cBut he urged me to just say something. And I did. But what I really liked about it was just how many different viewpoints there were. It works me up.\u201d If the Wednesday decision by the Bucks was an emotional one \u2014 understandable, since the Jacob Blake shooting in Kenosha was so close to home \u2014 the Thursday decision to resume play was a more rational one, given the circumstances and the stakes (financial and otherwise). Boycotting the season, while commendable, would\u2019ve had unintended consequences. In that sense, there would be victims caught in friendly crossfire, such as the NBA itself, its TV partners, the possibility of staff layoffs or furloughs (by the league, its teams and network partners). It might have even endangered the hotel workers at the Disney campus collecting paychecks during a pandemic. Jordan took part in the joint conference meeting with players and team owners and his presence was certainly not a coincidence. As a former player and the current owner of the Charlotte Hornets, Jordan knows both sides of the fence and served as a bond. He helped both sides understand each other\u2019s concerns and thoughts. There\u2019s another factor that possibly played in the player\u2019s decision to stay. Family members are already on campus and should clear quarantine by the weekend. They will have a soothing presence for players. Rivers mentioned as much when he discussed the challenges of being on campus for more than two months and the toll on mental health it\u2019s taking on some players. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that everyone in this bubble just seems to be a little more emotional,\u201d he said . \u201cPart of the thing about being jammed together has had that effect. Being in the bubble is hard.\u201d And so, the schedule is expected to resume Saturday with the postponed games of three days earlier, starting with Bucks-Magic, then Rockets-Thunder and Lakers-Blazers \u2014 all of which were originally Game 5s in each series. A day after the season was thrown in limbo, the players by all accounts regained their desire for the game. Rivers was encouraged not only by what he saw during their meeting, but also afterward. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there while the player meeting breaks and I see all these different players from different teams walking together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have pride, like \u2018We\u2019re trying to get something done.\u2019 And I\u2019m sitting with (Clippers assistant coach) Ty Lue and said, \u2018Man, look at these guys. This is awesome.\u2019 And Ty said the same thing. So, it\u2019s been pretty cool.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 Lute Olson, the Hall of Fame coach who turned Arizona into a college basketball powerhouse, has died. He was 85. Olson\u2019s family said he died Thursday evening. The cause of death wasn\u2019t given. \u201cCoach Olson is the absolute best, one of the greatest coaches ever and one of the greatest human beings ever,\u201d Georgia Tech coach and former Arizona player Josh Pasnter tweeted. \u201cMy feelings of gratitude and appreciation cannot be put in words. I love him dearly. My heart hurts, but I know he is now in heaven. May god bless his family. #RIP\u201d Olson spent 24 seasons at Arizona, revitalizing a fan base in the desert while transforming a program that had been to the NCAA Tournament just three times in 79 years before he was hired in 1983. Olson first took the Wildcats to the NCAA Tournament during his second season in Tucson to start a string of 25 straight appearances. The streak would have been the third-longest in NCAA history, but the 1999 and 2008 appearances were later vacated by the NCAA for impermissible benefits to players and recruiting violations. The Wildcats won a national championship under Olson in 1997 with a team led by Mike Bibby, Jason Terry and Miles Simon. Olson\u2019s Arizona teams reached the Final Four four times and lost the 2001 national title game to Duke. Olson won a school-record 589 games at Arizona, 11 Pac-10 titles and was named the conference coach of the year seven times. He led Arizona to 20 straight 20-win seasons and is one of five coaches in NCAA history with 29 seasons of at least 20 wins. Olson\u2019s 327 conference victories are most in Pac-10\/12 history and he was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame in 2002. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that a man is a Hall of Famer and still under appreciated,\u201d former Arizona and NBA player Richard Jefferson tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ll always feel like you never got the credit you deserved as a leader, family man, grandfather, coach and as a mentor. I love you Coach O.\u201d Olson had a series of health issues late in his coaching career, leading to his retirement in 2008. Arizona announced minutes before the 2007-08 season opener that Olson would take an indefinite leave of absence. Associate head coach Kevin O\u2019Neill coached the Wildcats on an interim basis the rest of the season. Olson was set to return for the 2008-09 season, but the school announced his retirement after he missed practice and a function in Tucson. His doctor held a news conference five days later, saying Olson had an initially undiagnosed stroke earlier in the year, causing depression and impaired judgment. Olson also was hospitalized in 2019 after suffering a minor stroke. Olson remained in Tucson and became a regular at the McKale Center during his retirement, drawing cheers every time he appeared on the video board. Born on a farm outside Mayville, North Dakota, on Sept. 22, 1934, Olson led his high school team to the 1952 state championship and was a three-sport athlete at Augsburg College in Minnesota from 1953 to 1956. Olson started his career as a high school coach in Minnesota and Southern California before becoming the head coach at Long Beach City College, where he won the state junior college title in 1971. He spent one season at Long Beach State before going on to coach nine seasons at Iowa. He led the Hawkeyes to the NCAA Tournament his final five seasons, including a trip to the 1980 Final Four. Olson had a career record of 780-280 in 34 years as a Division I coach."},{"id":26061,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-players-decide-resume-2020-playoffs","date":"2020-08-27","title":"Reports: Players decide to resume 2020 playoffs","content":" NBA players reportedly decided Thursday they want to continue the season, coming to that consensus one day after three postseason games were postponed in a protest of racial injustice. Despite the reported agreement to resume the playoffs, the three games scheduled for Thursday are postponed.

Per multiple reports, players were reportedly aiming to start games this weekend \u2014 perhaps as soon as Friday \u2014 but want to find new and improved ways to make social justice statements, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and Shams Charania of The Athletic. One potential remedy for the playoff schedule, per reports, was to play the three games that were postponed Wednesday on Friday, and the three games scheduled for Thursday on Saturday, though that had not been decided. Starting with the Milwaukee Bucks, who refused to take the court for their game Wednesday against the Orlando Magic, players from six teams made the extraordinary decisions to protest the shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday of Jacob Blake, a Black man, apparently in the back while three of his children looked on. Kenosha is about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. NBA players didn\u2019t come to Disney solely for a restart to their season. They also wanted social reform, as did other sports leagues \u2014 many of which followed the NBA\u2019s lead Wednesday by calling off games. Some NFL teams did the same Thursday, choosing not to practice. It followed a similar pattern as what happened in March: The NBA was the first league to shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, and other sports followed then as well. \u201cThe biggest thing that we all understand is if we\u2019re not playing, what are we doing? What are we doing to show and to help what\u2019s going on outside this bubble?\u201d Boston Celtics forward Grant Williams said, shortly before the Bucks were scheduled to tip off their game against the Magic. Instead, the Bucks players remained in the locker room, finally emerging hours later to read a statement demanding action from lawmakers and encouraging voting by citizens. They changed the narrative across the entire sports landscape, putting the focus squarely on social justice reform in protest of the shooting of Blake. While players and teams from baseball, the WNBA and MLS sat out their competitions Wednesday night, NBA players and coaches met for nearly three hours in a Disney hotel to determine next steps, including whether the season should continue. They did not come to a consensus, a person with knowledge of the meeting told AP on condition of anonymity because details weren\u2019t revealed publicly. More talks took place in the early hours of Thursday, followed by the player meeting that morning to decide to continue the season. The Western & Southern Open won\u2019t be played Thursday, with the U.S. Tennis Association, along with the ATP and WTA Tours, announcing play would be paused after two-time Grand Slam women\u2019s champion Naomi Osaka had already said she wouldn\u2019t play her semifinal match. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction,\u201d Osaka tweeted . \u201cWatching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach.\u201d Before coming to Disney, many NBA players wrestled for weeks about whether it was even right to play, fearing that a return to games would take attention off the deaths of, among others, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in recent months. They ultimately decided coming to the bubble and playing televised games would give them the largest platform, though now at least some are wondering if that\u2019s still true. It appears now they will find out if that\u2019s the case.

The main reason I\u2019ve been doing this my entire life \u2014 never once have I earned a nickel outside of journalism \u2014 is to be in the belly of the beast. To be on the scene when events happen. To witness news first-hand and speak to those involved and chronicle what just happened to give information to readers. To experience history in the making. It\u2019s sort of a calling, and in some situations a responsibility, although I don\u2019t necessarily believe what I do is making humanity better; I\u2019m not full of myself. Watching the drama unfold at Disney over the last few days merely confirms that I chose wisely decades ago when confronted with a career path in college and went to journalism (because I was awful at just about everything else). To hear Doc Rivers, coach of the Clippers, speak from the heart while addressing systemic racism \u2026 and marvel at the insight and wisdom of Jaylen Brown, who\u2019s just reaching his mid-20s \u2026 and beholding the growing awareness of Kyle Korver, a white player raised in Iowa \u2026 is stuff that those outside this business just don\u2019t experience first hand. Then, to be one of a handful of reporters to hear directly from the Bucks following their boycott, well that was special. Being a reporter gives you insight, allows you to step into the world of your subjects, to listen and in some cases to feel. We have advantages lacked by others in the public who form their opinion about people or events based on second-hand knowledge and half-truths and a lack of context. They\u2019re not in the belly. And because of that, my obligation becomes more important, to supply the information and then let the public decide. I don\u2019t walk in the player\u2019s shoes and therefore I can\u2019t say they\u2019re right or wrong for the choices they make; no one can. I\u2019ve learned that over the years. Your perspective can\u2019t be their perspective because you\u2019re not about that life. And vice versa. All you can do, and what I always do, is listen. Too often in this society, especially with social media, we talk at each other instead of talking to each other. There\u2019s a helluva difference. However, if the players asked me my opinion, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say: Your platform will never be bigger than it is right now at Disney, where the media are giving you a microphone. Take advantage of this perk here and now. After the playoffs, take your fight to the fight. Which means, if your issue is with the police, then be a presence among them. Hold press conferences at the precincts. Rattle that culture at the site. Same for government, go to the capitol steps. Educate yourself. Go back to college and take courses. Learn how the judicial system works. Strengthen your voice on this and other matters which in turn will only make you wiser \u2014 we all strive for that. Intelligence equals respect. And if LeBron James wants to generate swells of registered voters , he should be at polling centers personally, all day if necessary, with free autographs and selfies for those who register. And let everyone know in advance. That\u2019s game, set, match. Somewhere among the fray, I\u2019ll be standing, taking notes, learning, observing, analyzing and witnessing. The belly of the beast never disappoints because it\u2019s always feasting, and I\u2019m always hungry. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He wore a serious game face, which was unusual because tipoff against the Orlando Magic was still more than two hours away, but it was a hint. A few minutes later, the reigning Kia MVP made a U-turn, without pregame workout sweat, the first sign that something was up. He was joined by Khris Middleton, and when those All-Stars returned inside the locker room, they didn\u2019t emerge again for five hours, well after they and their teammates shook the NBA and the sports world. The 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks may eventually win this year\u2019s championship, assuming it will be played. And if they do, they may not generate the same level of spirited national conversation and rousing applause in some circles than they just did \u2014 by refusing to play a No. 8 seed in a playoff game. Stung by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed black man in Kenosha, Wisc., just 40 minutes south of Milwaukee, and disturbed by what they felt was a sluggish response from authorities to find justice, the Bucks chose to take a unified stand by taking a unified seat. They knew the historical significance of that; no professional sports team ever refused to play a game because of social injustice, not even in the 1960s. Black players on the Celtics in 1961, including Bill Russell, did skip an exhibition game in Lexington, Ky., after they were refused service at a local restaurant. However, the team did play that night, with seven players. Russell was a trail blazer during that turbulent time in America. He never refused to play during the Civil Rights era, but he did praise the Bucks through social media, writing on Twitter : \u201cI\u2019m moved by all the NBA players for standing up for what is right.\u201d The Bucks spoke with Wisconsin government officials during their lengthy locker room meeting (and in particular the state attorney general) in order to get answers and suggestions on how to force immediate change. While that took place, the dominoes pushed by the Bucks fell quickly beyond the locker room. Two other playoff games Wednesday were scrapped and player support both here and beyond Orlando was thermal for the Bucks, Magic, Lakers, Blazers, Thunder and Rockets \u2014 all of whom were all scheduled to play. They were joined by the player\u2019s union, NBA coaches, team owners, even some of the sponsors with paid ads on the canceled telecasts, and that was just among league circles. This became bigger than the Bucks. Other sports leagues then fell in line with the ripple: WNBA, Major Lague Baseball, Major League Soccer and tennis, all seeing game cancellations or some manner of player protest. The engineers of the Bucks\u2019 internal movement were George Hill, who just days earlier expressed second thoughts about coming to Orlando, and Sterling Brown, whose lawsuit against the Milwaukee police department is still ongoing, stemming from an arrest gone foul a few years ago. Those players read from a release , flanked by teammates, and took no questions. From the statement, Hill said: \u201cWhen we take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin, we are expected to play at a high level, give maximum effort and hold each other accountable. We hold ourselves to that standard, and in this moment, we are demanding the same from our lawmakers and law enforcement. We are calling for justice for Jacob Blake and demand the officers be held accountable. For this to occur, it is imperative for the Wisconsin State Legislature to reconvene after months of inaction and take up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform.\u201d The Bucks wanted to rattle society and poke those holding high office in Kenosha and crank the decibel level on social justice and this was certainly accomplished. And now, as in all matters of protest, there is a necessary transition and a bold question that asks: What next? The Bucks said they weren\u2019t emotionally ready to play. Brown read, from the statement: \u201cDespite the overwhelming plea for change, there has been no action, so our focus today cannot be on basketball.\u201d If the NBA players need action from Kenosha in order to refocus on basketball, and since action is hardly moments away, does this and should this spell the end of the NBA playoffs? How can players, taking them at their word, suddenly shift gears and lace up a day or two from now? What exactly will change dramatically in Kenosha and Minneapolis and from coast to coast in the interim? The NBA termed what happened Wednesday as a \u201cpostponement,\u201d which by definition is a delay. This implies the league expects the playoffs to continue, which would put it at odds with any players who\u2019d rather go home. A collection of heavyweights and union reps, LeBron James and Chris Paul among them, met through the night Wednesday. An emergency session of the Board of Governors is set for Thursday at 11 am, which promises to be a defining moment to see who wants and gets what, since the players are bringing financial and political demands.  It\u2019s all very fluid. At stake: Millions of TV revenue and the conclusion of the 2020 season, if the players and league are still putting any high value on that. The league would be caught in friendly fire from a business standpoint. Players and owners are rarely at odds in the NBA, the most progressive sports league in America, and in the case of social justice, the bond between them is tight. Everyone\u2019s on the same page, same book, same message. The league openly encouraged players and coaches to speak up on political and social issues well before 2020, and once canceled an All-Star Game in Charlotte in protest of a controversial North Carolina bathroom bill aimed at denying gay and transgender citizens. Also, the NBA threw its weight behind social justice in Orlando by allowing players to wear messages on their jerseys and painting Black Lives Matter on the court and relaxing the rule requiring players to stand for the anthem. No pro sports league can match this awareness level. But in the days following the Kenosha shooting, some players wondered if this was loud enough, and that they felt stifled in Orlando, where they\u2019re unable to leave for health reasons until they\u2019re eliminated from the playoffs. Those players wanted to take a more hands-on approach to social justice. That\u2019s tricky because a pandemic still rages, limiting movement beyond their homes even if this restart never happened. Being in Orlando allows them a nightly and massive platform they wouldn\u2019t enjoy on the outside except for LeBron and a handful of other stars with high appeal. Skipping a basketball game, in and of itself, will not stop police shootings \u2014 just as many other like-minded events in 2020 failed to do so. Otherwise, Kenosha wouldn\u2019t have happened. That said, in the fight for social justice, every action and step does matter if it rousts big business and influential people and voters and political decision-makers. The Bucks evidently believe this is that step, that in any marathon to produce change, they just covered a measurable amount of ground with a bandwagon they hope is filling up. That\u2019s a wish that remains to be realized. The segment of society that supported an overhaul in law enforcement before the Bucks chose not to play are totally behind them. There\u2019s also another segment of society that doesn\u2019t understand what the fuss is all about or the purpose of what the Bucks just did. Well, the team that just scored big points in Orlando will let America sort that out. Wearing black T-shirts adorned with quotations and messages and statements, all the Bucks players, flanked by coaches and support staff, refused to shut up and dribble. Hill even apologized for the long locker room delay, saying: \u201cWe thought it was best for us as a team to brainstorm a little bit, educate ourselves and not rush into having raw emotions.\u201d And now? \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to educating ourselves and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 Making their strongest statement yet in the fight against racial injustice, players from six NBA teams decided not to play postseason games on Wednesday in a boycott that quickly reverberated across other professional leagues. Also called off: Some games in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the three WNBA contests, as players across four leagues decided the best way to use their platform and demand change was to literally step off the playing surface. Players made the extraordinary decisions to protest the shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday of Jacob Blake, a Black man, apparently in the back while three of his children looked on. Kenosha is about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. That city\u2019s NBA team, the Bucks, started the boycotts Wednesday by refusing to emerge from their locker room to play a playoff game against the Orlando Magic. \u201cThere has been no action, so our focus today cannot be on basketball,\u201d said Bucks guard Sterling Brown, who joined teammate George Hill in reading a statement on the team\u2019s behalf. Brown has a federal lawsuit pending against the city of Milwaukee alleging he was targeted because he was Black and that his civil rights were violated in January 2018 when officers used a stun gun on him after a parking violation. Other games that were not played: NBA playoff games between Oklahoma City and Houston, and the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland; three WNBA games; MLB games between Milwaukee and Cincinnati and Seattle and San Diego; and five MLS matches. Two members of the St. Louis Cardinals sat out their team\u2019s game with the Kansas City Royals as well. The NBA\u2019s board of governors have called a meeting on Thursday to discuss the new developments, said a person with knowledge of the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the meeting plan was not revealed publicly. \u201cThe baseless shootings of Jacob Blake and other black men and women by law enforcement underscores the need for action,\u201d the NBA Coaches Association said in a statement. \u201cNot after the playoffs, not in the future, but now.\u201d The statement by the Bucks also called for state lawmakers to reconvene and take immediate action \u201cto address issues of police accountability, brutality, and criminal justice reform.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. Thank you, Bucks,\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers tweeted. The NBA did not say when Wednesday\u2019s games would be played or if Thursday\u2019s schedule of three more games involving six other teams would be affected. NBA players and coaches were meeting Wednesday night to determine next steps, presumably including whether the season should continue. \u201cWe fully support our players and the decision they made,\u201d Bucks owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan said in a joint statement. \u201cAlthough we did not know beforehand, we would have wholeheartedly agreed with them. The only way to bring about change is to shine a light on the racial injustices that are happening in front of us.\u201d Added Jeanie Buss, the Governor of the Lakers, in a tweet: \u201cI stand behind our players, today and always. After more than 400 years of cruelty, racism and injustice, we all need to work together to say enough is enough.\u201d Several NBA players, including the Lakers\u2019 LeBron James, tweeted out messages demanding change. Some teams including Boston, Orlando and Utah released messages supporting the players. \u201cWe weren\u2019t given advanced notice about the decision but we are happy to stand in solidarity with Milwaukee, Jacob, and the entire NBA community,\u201d Orlando guard Michael Carter-Williams said. \u201cChange is coming.\u201d Magic players and referees were on the basketball court for the game but Milwaukee never took the floor. The National Basketball Referees Association said it \u201cstands in solidarity\u201d with the players, and teams including Orlando and Boston released statements or tweets of support. \u201cPlayers have, once again, made it clear \u2014 they will not be silent on this issue,\u201d National Basketball Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts said. Demanding societal change and ending racial injustice has been a major part of the NBA\u2019s restart at Walt Disney World. The phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is painted on the arena courts, players are wearing messages urging change on their jerseys and coaches are donning pins demanding racial justice as well. Many players wrestled for weeks about whether it was even right to play, fearing that a return to games would take attention off the deaths of, among others, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in recent months. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot when police officers burst into her Louisville, Kentucky apartment using a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation on March 13. The warrant was in connection with a suspect who did not live there and no drugs were found. Then on May 25, Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into the Black man\u2019s neck for nearly eight minutes \u2014 all captured on a cell phone video. Hill said after Blake\u2019s shooting that he felt players shouldn\u2019t have come to Disney. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones getting killed,\u201d Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who is Black, said in an emotional speech Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones getting shot. We\u2019re the ones that we\u2019re denied to live in certain communities. We\u2019ve been hung. We\u2019ve been shot. And all you do is keep hearing about fear. It\u2019s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s really so sad.\u201d Players from Boston and Toronto met Tuesday to discuss boycotting Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series, which had been scheduled for Thursday. NBPA officers were part of those meetings, and Miami forward Andre Iguodala \u2014 one of those officers\u2014 said around 2:15 p.m. that he did not believe a boycott plan had been finalized. Things apparently moved quickly: Less than two hours later, the Bucks wouldn\u2019t take the floor. \u201cWhen you talk about boycotting a game, everyone\u2019s antenna goes up,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad you have to make threats like that \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say threats \u2014 but you have to be willing to sacrifice corporate money for people to realize there\u2019s a big problem out there.\u201d Professional sports has seen both strikes and lockouts in the past, almost always over salary disputes. But this wouldn\u2019t seem to classify as a strike, even though it was initiated by players, since their dispute is not with the NBA. Boycott, meanwhile, is defined as the act of refusing to engage in an action, usually to express disapproval with some condition. * * * Reynolds reported from Miami."},{"id":26125,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/statement-nbpa-executive-director-michele-roberts-official-release","date":"2020-08-27","title":"Statement from NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts on player protest and postponement of games","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 \u201cThroughout the season restart, our players have been unwavering in their demands for systemic justice.

Nate and I have been through the good times and the bad times; and it was an honor to work with him for those 11 years (in Indiana and Portland).\u201d The team said it will begin a search for a new coach immediately and one name is potentially already on the radar. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Houston Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni \u2014 who is in the final year of his deal \u2014 will be a target for the Pacers should he become available. The move is a shocking one considering McMillan and the Pacers had agreed to a contract extension on Aug. 12. Indiana made the 2020 playoffs as a No. 4 seed, but it was swept 4-0 in the first round by the Miami Heat. McMillan\u2019s firing comes just two days after the Pacers lost 99-87 in Game 4 . He was named coach of the Pacers in 2016 and had yet to post a losing season with the team, winning at least 42 games in every season. He has compiled a 183-136 record with Indiana, and ranks third in Pacers\u2019 franchise history in career wins as a coach. Indiana played through the Orlando season restart without All-Star big man Domantas Sabonis, who left the NBA campus to treat a plantar fasciitis injury in his left foot . All-Star guard Victor Oladipo participated in six of the Pacers\u2019 eight seeding games while working his way back from a knee injury. The loss to Miami on Monday sealed a second straight first-round sweep and the team\u2019s third in four years \u2014 the only best-of-seven series sweeps in the franchise\u2019s NBA history. They\u2019ve lost a franchise-record nine consecutive playoff games, too. Jeremy Lamb, who played well while replacing Oladipo in the starting lineup, and again after Oladipo returned in late January, also was not available in the bubble because of a season-ending left knee injury suffered three weeks before the season was stopped by COVID-19. Oladipo\u2019s contract expires after next season and he will be up for payday. The Pacers gave big man Myles Turner a four-year, $80 million deal before the 2018-19 season and Sabonis signed a four-year extension that could pay out as much as $85 million in October. Indiana also acquired guard Malcolm Brogdon in a sign-and-trade deal from Milwaukee, a deal that gives Brogdon $85 million over four years. McMillan was in his third stint as an NBA coach, previously serving as coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1999-2005) and Portland Trail Blazers (2005-12). He was an associate head coach for the Pacers from 2013-16 before being promoted to coach. He is 661-588 all-time in the regular season and 17-36 in the playoffs in his career (including a 3-16 playoff mark with Indiana). He has gotten out of the first round once in his career, when the 2004-05 Sonics reached the Western Conference semifinals.

After watching his All-Star partner Paul George wander through three straight games against the Dallas Mavericks, he went straight to it from the start Tuesday night, scoring 15 points in the first quarter. George did his part from there, emerging from what he called a \u201cdark place\u201d to lead the Clippers\u2019 154-111 Game 5 demolition of the Dallas Mavericks to get his game back and the Clippers back on track with a 3-2 series lead . Two days after he scored just nine points in an overtime loss on a Luka Doncic buzzer-beater in Game 4 , George was on the hunt from the start in his attempt to shake out of his funk. He led the Clippers with 35 points as they set a franchise playoff record for points, 3-pointers made (22) and point differential. >> Game 6: Clippers vs. Mavericks, Thursday, 9 ET, ESPN He made 12 of his 18 shots from the floor, draining 4-for-8 shots from 3-point range and went 7-for-7 on free throws. It was a much needed turn for a star who admitted that life in the NBA \u201cbubble\u201d had starting wearing on him mentally. \u201cThe bubble got the best of me,\u201d George said of trying to adjust to a playoffs with no fans, away from the comforts of home and the refuge his normal environment provides. \u201cI was just in a dark place. I wasn\u2019t here. I checked out. \u201cThese past couple games it was just difficult. But shout out to the people that stood behind, that was in my corner, the positivity, my teammates, my family, friends, everybody. Thank everybody that reached out to me. I was just in a bad place and I found my way, I\u2019m back and I look forward to the next of this run.\u201d The time between games was emotional for all of the Clippers. Coach Doc Rivers admitted as much after the game. He had late-night heart-to-heart talk with George after Game 4 and said the entire team did its part to lift George up during what was obviously a trying time. But it was more than just a basketball issue. Life on the NBA campus in Orlando and the separation from the outside world, where the Jacob Blake shooting in Wisconsin added another dose of cold reality for the Clippers. They are like every other team, Rivers said, grappling with the pressures of the playoffs while the same issues they\u2019ve been speaking out about since the George Floyd killing in Minnesota sparked protests nationwide and, eventually, around the globe. \u201cThis is not a normal environment, okay. It just isn\u2019t,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, like the NBA has done a terrific job. But Lou [Williams] made a great point, you lose a lot of games, and the game the other night was tough, and usually you go home to your family, here you go back to your rooms and your with each other and then you actually see the other teams. It\u2019s just a strange thing, man. I tell you it\u2019s just different. \u201cI thought our guys were great, though. PG and I sat in my room after the game and we just had a long talk, not all about basketball really, and you know several players did it. Guys were knocking on his door. This team is \u2026 you know we\u2019re growing still, you can see it. We\u2019ve not had the normal time together like most teams. And so things like that, they happen. I thought our guys \u2026 I\u2019m just proud of all the players.\u201d As important as it was for the Clippers to rebound from that Game 4 loss and regain control in the series, it was perhaps even more important that George get back in his groove. Leonard scored 32 points, continuing his steady roll in the series. He was more focused on George getting back to normal, though, and was deliberate in his effort to make sure it happened. It worked to perfection as George scored 18 points on 8-for-12 shooting by halftime to go along with Leonard\u2019s 22 first-half points as the Clippers shredded the Mavericks for a 76-52 lead. George stayed aggressive, scoring five straight points to kick off the third quarter and the Clippers never slowed down. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s been aggressive the whole series,\u201d Leonard said, defending George after the game. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t make shots. Now you\u2019re saying he was aggressive because he made shots. But he\u2019s been playing that way this whole series. And they fell for him tonight.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt George needed a breakout night. He scored 27 points in the series opener but couldn\u2019t find his footing in Games 2, 3 and 4 \u2014 11.3 points on 21% shooting from the floor, 16% from 3-point range. \u201cI just got into a different place,\u201d George said. \u201cMentally, I just locked into a different place. I won\u2019t go into details, but I got into a different place, a different mentality, a different mindset and I found myself. I came out and found myself. it was just a little bit of everything. I underestimated mental health, honestly. I had anxiety, a little bit of depression, just being locked in here and, you know, I just wasn\u2019t there, I checked out. Games 2, 3, 4 \u2026 I just wasn\u2019t there. I felt like I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d George said he needed all the resources the Clippers could provide to get his mind right, to get his head back in the game and this series. He also leaned on family and friends and his teammates, of course. The boost came from all directions, he said, near and far. \u201cEverybody reached out,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it was in person or through a text. All of my guys showed up for me. They helped me. They were there when I needed them. I\u2019m indebted to this team. The love, the energy, the synergy, the camaraderie, the brotherhood. I can\u2019t thank this squad enough.\u201d Rivers implored his team to bring their own energy for a game that, under normal circumstances would have been played before a raucous Staples Center crowd. They did exactly that, with the bench cranked up from the start and the noise and at a fever pitch the entire game. A 19-0 first quarter run turned into a 32-6 blitz, followed by another 11-0 run before halftime. and there was no coming back this time for the Mavericks, who \u201cI came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we\u2019re at home, the place is packed,\u201d George said after becoming the first player in the shot clock era to score at least 35 points in under 25 minutes in a playoff game. \u201cI really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.\u201d The Mavericks couldn\u2019t match any of what the Clippers showed up with. Doncic finished with a team-high 22 points to go along with his eight rebounds and four assists. But he was frustrated for most of his 31 minutes, playing on a tender left ankle that seemed to cause him more discomfort in this game than it did in Game 4. Kristaps Porzingis missed his second straight game of the series with that sore right knee. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle didn\u2019t get to see the finish from the court; he was ejected from the game with 6:42 to play in the third quarter. There were six technical fouls and a flagrant-1 (on Tim Hardaway Jr., who wound up for a blow George\u2019s face defending a drive) in a game that saw players from both teams jawing back and forth from start to finish. \u201cThey \u2019 ve been doing a lot of chirping the whole series,\u201d Hardaway said. \u201cSo we \u2019 ve done a great job coming out on top twice and prevailing twice. We \u2019 ve got to focus on doing the same thing on Thursday and bouncing back like we have been doing this whole series.\u201d It should make for an intense Game 6 atmosphere Thursday night, one that no one will need any extra motivation in preparation for, given the circumstances. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Coaches and players get selfish because they want what they want, sooner and easier, in playoff series that are as short and as lopsided as they possibly can be. This season has been long \u2013 the longest ever, by the calendar count \u2013 so with all the extra challenges inside and outside the Disney bubble in Orlando, there selfishly is only one perfect ending for the participants: Advance to the next round, go 12-0 from there and throw the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy into the overhead bin for the flight home. Then there are the rest of us, who want what we want too. And what we selfishly want is more. More highlight plays, more buzzer-beaters, more moments. And in the case of the Denver-Utah series, more Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray. > Game 6: Jazz vs. Nuggets; Thursday, 4 ET on ESPN Getting five games pitting two of the Western Conference\u2019s emerging stars has been terrific. Thanks to Murray\u2019s remarkable performance Tuesday \u2014 42 points, 33 in the second half, to lead the Nuggets to their 117-107 elimination-defying victory \u2014 we\u2019re assured of a sixth, coming on Thursday (4 ET, ESPN). And if we\u2019re being honest (and aren\u2019t simply impatient Utah fans), we selfishly, greedily are hoping for a seventh. That\u2019s how special Mitchell vs. Murray has been. Seven-game series? It\u2019s feeling more like a seven-round heavyweight championship fight, in spite of the NBA Finals being a month away. The video clips of their backcourt matchup thus far could be edited to that old song, \u201cAnything you can do, I can do better\u201d. They\u2019ve come back from the lockdown hiatus as noticeably improved, more dynamic and, for now, consistent players. Game 5 belonged to Murray and his Nuggets. When the Denver defense got stingier in the third quarter, rejecting the 15-point deficit that was on the verge of putting them down and out, Murray was ready to handle the other end. He scored 11 of Denver\u2019s 13 points in a run that whacked Utah\u2019s 81-69 lead to 84-82. Murray\u2019s last bucket in the 13-3 stretch was a flying, 360-degree layup that was more breathtaking than if it had been a dunk. He had scored 17 in the period, 26 in the game to that point, and then he kept going. Over the final 12 minutes, with Murray playing them all, he scored 16 more. He didn\u2019t neglect his point-guard responsibilities either, dishing four assists, mostly looking for Nikola Jokic (eight points in the fourth), Jerami Grant (seven) and Michael Porter Jr. (four). Jokic had 21 points in the first quarter on 8-of-8 shooting to stake Denver to 33 points. Murray\u2019s 7-of-8 in the fourth helped them reach 35. \u201cHe started it and I finished it,\u201d Murray said. But that was it for sizzle from his postgame Zoom session, as time and again the fourth-year pro from Kitchener, Ontario (by way of a season in Lexington, Kentucky) opted for the \u201cnever get too high, never get too low\u201d boilerplate verbiage. No problem for Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who was happy to hyperbolize on Murray\u2019s behalf. \u201cJamal embraces the moment,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of it. Some people run away from those moments. He looks for them. Not even just the points. His attitude, that swagger, that confidence, that is contagious to all the players. \u201cForty-two, eight and eight. The young man is growing up and turning into a superstar on the biggest stage, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of him.\u201d Murray, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, became the first player to log consecutive 40-point games in the playoffs without committing a turnover. At least since 1977 anyway, when individual turnovers started getting tracked. Malone recalled a game against Chicago when Murray, as a rookie, caught fire and played beyond his years. \u201cHe took over, and you could see he fed off the energy of the crowd,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe came to us with that. He\u2019s a big-game player. In these playoffs, he\u2019s making even more of a name for himself for that.\u201d Mitchell, too. Through five games, the Jazz guard is averaging 37.6 points, 4.0 rebounds and 5.6 assists, with games of 57, 51 and (twice) 30. Murray is at 30.8, 6.4 and 6.8, and after a regular season in which he scored 36 or more three times in 59 games, he has done that three times in five in this series. That includes memorable Game 4, when Mitchell had 51 and Murray 50. No crowds to feed off in the bubble, but lots of skills on display. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fun,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI\u2019m not focusing on it but it\u2019s hard to not notice. He\u2019s going at a high clip and we\u2019re doing different things to stop him. They\u2019re just hitting so many shots, it\u2019s hard to put that much attention on Donovan and still get out and contest all those other shooters. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on a 1-on-1 battle. Winning is the priority.\u201d Said Mitchell, whose 30 points seemed like a slow night only by comparison: \u201cThey hit a level that we didn\u2019t quite reach. That\u2019s just on us. [Murray] did a great job of getting downhill, getting to the rim, knocking shots down. For me, it\u2019s just trying to make it tough on him. \u201cHe hit tough shots. He made tough moves. I\u2019ve got to give him credit. I\u2019ve got to be able to do both.\u201d Did he say both? That\u2019s our selfish answer to the question: Do we want to see Murray and Mitchell play one more game, or two? * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

There\u2019s another rapid expansion happening on these NBA streets, and it can be measured in the political and social awareness of the players. You hear it in their voices and their answers, see it in their actions. A vast majority of them never graduated college or even did three years on campus. A few, such as LeBron James, skipped it altogether. Some never took school or studying too seriously; they weren\u2019t training to be accountants or computer programmers. Plenty, along with their teenage and early-20s brethren, could be accused in the past of having their hands attached to electronic games or eyes transfixed to 24-hour sports shows instead of scanning The New York Times beyond the sports page or subscribing to magazines or reading books. That apparently has changed, or is changing. The recent deaths of unarmed Black men and women, shot by police, has forced NBA players to wise up and rise up beyond the court. The platforms enjoyed by the famous \u2014 tons of social media followers and constant TV exposure \u2014 can crack and collapse from the ignorance of those who stand on them. Players are realizing this and so they\u2019re doing whatever necessary to ensure their own solid footing by becoming more informed and aware. This presents a perplexing issue, though: How much social justice awareness, how many statements and demonstrations from athletes \u2026 how much is enough for a public that just wants to enjoy basketball and escape from grim realities? It\u2019s a tricky line to walk here in summer 2020, and especially in the last few days: Another shooting \u2014 this time just south of Milwaukee, home of the title-contending Bucks \u2014 has put players back on that platform. Here\u2019s a sampling of their reactions: Fred VanVleet, Raptors (After sweeping the Nets)  LeBron James, Lakers  Every team still alive and playing on the Walt Disney World campus is competing for a championship against each other, and every team is also showing unity regarding the real-life events beyond the protective and insular basketball ecosystem in Orlando. There\u2019s a legitimate question, however, whether the outside world is devouring every word and demonstration and taking it to heart and using it to make change. The public missed sports during the early stages of the pandemic when everything shut down. Now that the NBA and other leagues are making a welcome-yet-careful return, the loyalists are again getting their fix. Sports has always provided an escape, although now, the intersectionality of politics and social justice seems unavoidable in an election year \u2014 and a bloody one for Black men and women in America. Television commentators are broaching the player protests during the game telecasts and staying on subject, although there\u2019s a small twist: After the first few initial days of the restart schedule, the TV broadcasts have reverted back to their normal programming pattern of not showing the National Anthem, and also the symbolic kneeling. VanVleet and teammate Norman Powell dropped hints that the Raptors discussed taking their protests a step further, considering a refusal to play their opening Eastern Conference semifinal game against the Celtics on Thursday ( 6:30 ET, ESPN ). That would be extreme. Would America suddenly become a more understanding country, and police reform magically manifest, all because two NBA teams chose not to play a game? Why punish the most supportive and progressive professional sports league in the country and its TV partners by doing something so radical? Lakers coach Frank Vogel questioned what a cease-play would accomplish by citing a recent discussion with John Carlos and said: \u201cHe trained with the intent of reaching the medal stand so he could make the victory statement. The further we advance in the playoffs, the further our platform to speak up on this grows.\u201d And that\u2019s the point: By playing this restart, NBA players are already executing their plan to raise awareness about an issue that cuts deeply within, something they couldn\u2019t achieve while sitting at home. It\u2019s a righteous stand that\u2019s more about humanity than anything else, and therefore should connect with everyone regardless of race, religion or political leanings. Their message about the shootings is this: That could\u2019ve been me. Or my son or daughter or brother or sister. Or maybe you. But, as Brown said, wearing T-shirts and kneeling are cosmetic responses that only travel so far within the intended audience. \u201cPeople ask me, `Jaylen, what should we do?\u2019 Like, I\u2019m a 23-year-old \u2026 you shouldn\u2019t be asking a 23-year-old, \u2018What should we do?\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of people that dedicated their lives to this.\u201d The players are doing their part by staying on-message and increasing the volume when necessary. This was part of the agreement with the league for holding this restart and the message is being promoted hard, even more after the Sunday shooting of Blake. Is America already weary and woozy from the daily barrage of statements, or asking for second and third helpings? America doesn\u2019t have a choice. There\u2019s a steady stream of social consciousness to go with Donovan Mitchell dropping 60- and 50-point games, and Luka going epic on the Clippers, and LeBron flirting fabulously with history. The NBA and its players are insisting that you must have it both ways. And this won\u2019t change until society does. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

This marks the first NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award for Antetokounmpo, who finished in second place last season.  Antetokounmpo, the 2018-19 Kia NBA Most Valuable Player, becomes the fifth player selected as both the NBA MVP and the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in a career, joining Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson and Kevin Garnett. The 6-11 Greek forward also joins Sidney Moncrief as the only players to win the Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award with the Bucks. Moncrief played for Milwaukee when he earned the honor in both the 1982-83 and 1983-84 seasons, the first two seasons that the award was presented. Antetokounmpo received 75 first-place votes from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters and earned 432 total points. Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis (200 points; 14 first-place votes) and Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (187 points; six first-place votes) finished in second and third place, respectively. Gobert was honored as the Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year in each of the previous two seasons. Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30 \u2013 Aug. 14 as part of the 2019-20 season restart, did not count toward voting for the Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards.  In games played through March 11, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to the NBA\u2019s best defensive rating as they allowed 101.6 points per 100 possessions. With Antetokounmpo on the court, Milwaukee allowed only 96.5 points per 100 possessions, the lowest defensive rating among the more than 300 players who averaged at least 15.0 minutes per game. From the beginning of the season through March 11, Milwaukee\u2019s opponents shot an NBA-low 41.3 percent from the field. Antetokounmpo held his matchups to 36.5 percent shooting from the field, the lowest percentage among the more than 250 players who faced at least 300 shots. Antetokounmpo averaged an NBA-high 11.5 defensive rebounds in games played through March 11, highlighted by nine games with at least 15 defensive rebounds. He also averaged 1.04 steals and 1.02 blocked shots, making him one of six players to average one or more in both categories. In addition to being named the Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Antetokounmpo is a finalist for the 2019-20 Kia NBA Most Valuable Award after averaging 29.6 points, 13.7 rebounds and 5.8 assists in games played through March 11 while helping Milwaukee post an NBA-best 53-12 record during that period. TNT will announce the winner of the Kia NBA MVP Award during its coverage of the 2020 NBA Playoffs.   The voting results for the 2019-20 Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award are below. The balloting was tabulated by the independent accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP. Complete ballots for each voter will be posted at pr.nba.com after the announcement of all end-of-season awards.

When the Raptors spoke to the media from the NBA campus in Orlando on Tuesday, there was no discussion of how they\u2019re going to guard Jayson Tatum. There was the briefest of updates on Kyle Lowry\u2019s left ankle injury. The All-Star point guard didn\u2019t practice on Tuesday and is \u201cday-to-day,\u201d according to Raptors head coach Nick Nurse. Mostly, there was frustration. Frustration after seeing video of another Black man, Jacob Blake, being shot by police . Blake is hospitalized after being shot in the back seven times while opening a car door in Kenosha, Wisconsin. \u201cI was pretty excited [about the Boston series] and then we all had to watch Jacob Blake get shot yesterday,\u201d Fred VanVleet said. \u201cSo that kind of changes the tone of things and puts things in perspective. That\u2019s really kind of all that\u2019s been on my mind. \u201cComing down here and making the choice to play was supposed to not be in vain. But it\u2019s just starting to feel like everything we\u2019re doing is just going through the motions and nothing\u2019s really changing. And here we are again with another unfortunate incident. So my thoughts today are with that man and his family.\u201d Not long after the Raptors spoke, Celtics forward Jaylen Brown expressed similar anguish, saying that, going forward, when he sees the No. 7 on his jersey, \u201cwhat I see is a black man being shot seven times.\u201d The Raptors arrived in Orlando aboard two buses emblazoned with \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d messaging. But Norman Powell expressed similar feelings as VanVleet about the futility of what\u2019s been said and done thus far. Asked about the possibility of players boycotting games, he said that \u201cit\u2019s been talked about.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of things that are being talked about in how to approach this sensitive issue,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s at the point of sitting up here and saying \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls and this, that and the other, putting apparel on. That\u2019s not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that\u2019s not getting the job done. It\u2019s starting to get washed out. \u201cSomething has to happen to where you\u2019re forcing those people who can effect and make the change to do something.\u201d \u201cWe knew coming here or not coming here was not going to stop anything,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cBut I think ultimately playing or not playing puts pressure on somebody.\u201d He added that the player\u2019s actions could influence Milwaukee Bucks ownership to put pressure on state and local officials in Wisconsin \u201cto make real change and get some justice.\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s not that simple,\u201d VanVleet continued, \u201cbut at the end of the day, if we\u2019re going to sit here and talk about making change then at some point we\u2019re going to have to put our nuts on the line and actually put something up to lose, rather than just money or visibility. I\u2019m just over the media aspect of it. It\u2019s sensationalized. We talk about it everyday. That\u2019s all we see, but it just feels like a big pacifier to me.\u201d Nurse\u2019s job in this situation is to prepare for Game 1 on Thursday, but also to put that on the back burner for as long as necessary. \u201cWe had a fairly long team gathering this morning. I wouldn\u2019t call it a team meeting because it wasn\u2019t really basketball related,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to acknowledge that if nobody feels like playing basketball or talking about basketball or anything, that\u2019s OK.\u201d But Nurse thinks that basketball should be played. \u201cWe have a platform here,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think playing still gives us a chance to still use that platform rather than not playing does. That has not changed for me and I think the issues need to continue to be dealt with and talked about seriously.\u201d The question is what follows the talk and exactly how the issues get dealt with. \u201cIt\u2019s on all of us to actually stand up and demand things,\u201d Powell said, \u201cand get in front of these people\u2019s faces that make the laws and have the power to fully effect change, and force them to. Until that is done, ain\u2019t **** gonna change. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit up here and answer your guys\u2019 questions and continue to say \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 and make and effect change. But until we all who believe that and see what\u2019s going on are ready to step up and lay it on the line to make real change and move towards real progress and take the ones that don\u2019t belong in that field out, we\u2019re going to keep seeing it over and over again.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Big man Kristaps Porzingis has been ruled out for Game 5 against the LA Clippers on Tuesday night ( 9 ET, TNT ), the pivotal game in a series tied 2-2. The former All-Star has been undergoing treatment for his sore right knee and as of Monday was expected to a game-time decision, per coach Rick Carlisle. The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Monday that the MRI on Porzingis\u2019 knee came back negative. Carlisle told reporters Monday he would not comment on questions about the MRI showing any structural issues, but said nothing on the MRI ruled Porzingis out for Game 5. > Game 5: Mavericks vs. Clippers, Tuesday (9 ET on TNT) Porzingis was a last-minute scratch for Game 4 as the news came out after the Mavericks learned that guard Luka Doncic would play Sunday despite a left ankle sprain. All Doncic did in that game was hit a game-winning, step-back 3-pointer in overtime to give Dallas a 135-133 win . In the course of that performance, Doncic netted 43 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists for his second straight triple-double. His theatrics helped the seventh-seeded Mavericks post their biggest playoff comeback win, overcoming a 21-point, second-quarter deficit. Their previous best was 19 against the Spurs in San Antonio during Game 5 of the 2003 Western Conference finals. Porzingis is averaging 23.7 points and 8.7 rebounds in the Western Conference first-round series. He is coming off a Game 3 performance in which he had 34 points and 13 rebounds. It\u2019s the first time a Dallas player has scored 30 or more points and grabbed 10 or more rebounds since Dirk Nowitzki in the 2011 NBA Finals. The 21-year-old Doncic hurt his left ankle in Game 3. Yet he hardly looked hampered, going 18 of 31 from the floor in Game 4. He tested the ankle often, too, with jump stops, pivots and an impressive Euro-steps to gain separation.

What they aren\u2019t seeking, per GM Elton Brand, is a new nucleus to build their team around. Brand spoke with the media on Tuesday and made it clear he is not looking to trade away All-Star center Joel Embiid or All-Star guard Ben Simmons. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to trade Ben or Joel. I\u2019m trying to compliment them,\u201d Brand said. \u201cThey\u2019re 24 and 26 and want to be here. You try to make that fit as long as possible.\u201d As for the successor to Brown, Brand said the search for a new coach begins immediately. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin a search for a new coach immediately and will examine the rest of the front office and the roster,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI owe it to our fans to deliver on our goal. I still believe in our young core.\u201d Brand also plans to talk with Simmons and Embiid about what moves could potentially help the team. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk with Joel and Ben, about the game and how they see it, where they felt we were weak and strong in our play,\u201d Brand said. The 76ers were 43-30 this season and had woefully underachieved in a season when they were expected to be serious contenders in the Eastern Conference. After the sixth-seeded Sixers were swept by the Boston Celtics , the firing of Brown was expected. \u201cI have a tremendous level of respect for Brett both personally and professionally and appreciate all he\u2019s done for the 76ers organization and the city of Philadelphia,\u201d Brand said in a statement Monday. \u201cHe did many positive things during his time here, developing young talent and helping position our team for three straight postseason appearances. Unfortunately, we fell well short of our goals this year and I believe it is best to go in a new direction.\u201d Brown won only 47 games in his first three seasons, including a 10-72 record in 2015-16, as the Sixers maneuvered through \u201cThe Process\u201d of rebuilding their team. The philosophy paid off when Philly drafted Embiid (in 2014) and Simmons (in 2016), who would both become All-Stars and lead the Sixers to two straight trips to the Eastern Conference semifinals. Both were solid this season, with Embiid averaging 23 points, 11.6 rebounds, three assists and 1.3 blocks per game and Simmons chipping in with 19.6 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 8.0 apg and 2.1 steals per game. Simmons missed the postseason with a knee injury and neither Embiid nor the players brought in in recent years could provide enough scoring in clutch situations against Boston. The 76ers have $28.8 million to Simmons and $29.5 million to Embiid committed for next season. In addition, the Sixers have committed $27.5 million to Al Horford and a whopping $34.4 million to forward Tobias Harris, too. Horford and Embiid never meshed to the point where Horford was benched at times in the regular season and playoffs and became a scapegoat for Philly\u2019s woes. \u201cMy goal and my focus is to continue to get this team over the hump to truly contend. And that\u2019s my marching orders,\u201d Brand said Tuesday. \u201cThe financial realities of the world, I understand them, but my goal is to keep this team relevant and find a way to win.\u201d Philadelphia added Horford in the offseason via free agency and re-signed Harris after the team pushed the eventual-champion Toronto Raptors to a Game 7 in the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals.

Brown was tasked with the leading the Sixers through a rebuild dubbed \u201cThe Process,\u201d where management stripped the roster of serious NBA talent to lose games and increase their odds at better draft picks. Brown won only 47 games in his first three seasons, including a 10-72 record in 2015-16.

In the past seven years, our players and coaches have evolved and grown, and I have deep appreciation for the 102 players I have coached,\u201d Brown said. The Sixers believed they were ready to contend for their first championship in 37 years and Brand spent $180 million to re-sign Tobias Harris and nearly $100 million to sign free agent Al Horford away from Boston. Instead, the Sixers had only snippets of consistent success and Brown paid the price, the longtime San Antonio Spurs assistant coach now out of a job on a contract that runs through the 2021-2022 season. Even with two 26-game losing streaks on Brown\u2019s resume, the front office never wavered early in his tenure that Brown was the right coach to bring Philadelphia its first championship since 1983. He steered the franchise as interim general manager in 2018 after Bryan Colangelo was fired amid a Twitter scandal. But the Sixers\u2019 support started to wean at the end of the last season, as team owner Josh Harris for the first time put public pressure on Brown to at least reach the East final. And at an impromptu news conference before the start of the playoffs, Harris refused to say if Brown would return and offered only a lukewarm endorsement of his performance. Another lukewarm endorsement of Brown came Sunday from guard Josh Richardson after the Sixers\u2019 elimination. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019s a good man, he means well. I just think going forward he\u2019s got to ask more accountability,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was much accountability this season and I think that was part of our problem.\u201d"},{"id":26152,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-break-through-offensive-finds-rhythm","date":"2020-08-25","title":"Lakers break through, leave Blazers with little hope","content":" The Los Angeles Lakers took less than a week to go from vulnerable to dominant.

To properly illustrate his team\u2019s new-found offensive rhythm (and to put some TV viewers to bed early), LeBron James (30 points, six rebounds and 10 assists) casually stepped into a 36-foot 3-pointer to put the Lakers up by 38 with 9:21 left in the third quarter. Good night. But not a perfect night. Anthony Davis, after shooting 7-for-8 from mid-range, left with back spasms early in the third quarter. The Blazers also lost Damian Lillard to a right knee injury midway through the third. The Blazers say that Lillard will have a second on his knee on Tuesday. Davis, who looked comfortable on the Lakers\u2019 bench throughout the second half, said after the game that his back is \u201cdoing fine.\u201d 10-for-18 \u2014 The combined 3-point shooting from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma. Davis suddenly becoming Dirk Nowitzki from mid-range ( where he\u2019s 11-for-13 over the last two games ) and James draining 3-pointers from the logo like Lillard is nice. But the jump-shooting from those two guys, though the Lakers were due given how poorly they shot prior to Game 3, isn\u2019t sustainable. Davis was a 35% mid-range shooter in the regular season , while James shot just 33% on pull-up 3s . The stars\u2019 best work is done in the paint. And against better defensive teams, they\u2019ll need the supporting cast to make shots, either to create space for the Davis and James, or to punish defenses for clogging the paint. Green was 12-for-44 (27%) from 3-point range over the Lakers\u2019 first 11 games in Orlando. Caldwell-Pope was 5-for-23 (22%) from beyond the arc through Game 1 of the first round before finding his shot in Game 2. Kuzma shot well in the seeding games, but was 2-for-10 from beyond the arc through the first three games of this series. These are the three shooters that will spend the most time around Davis and James. Their own success is and will continue to be critical. There will be ups and downs going forward. The Lakers can bring the defense every night, but the spotlight will remain on their shooting. It doesn\u2019t need to be elite, but when it is, the Lakers are in good shape. They\u2019re now 20-1 this season (with 13 of the wins having come by at least 15 points) when they\u2019ve shot 40% or better on 3-pointers, and the only loss was their final seeding game , in which James played less than 15 minutes and Davis didn\u2019t play at all. Winning ugly is also an option. From the way they defended over the first several minutes Monday, the Lakers weren\u2019t counting on all the shots to fall. Davis, in particular, was a force defensively as Portland went scoreless on its first seven possessions. \u201cHe was absolutely dominant to start this game tonight,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cHe had several blocks, deflections, containment plays. He was just all over the place on the defensive end, and then he was making everything.\u201d Here are those first seven possessions for Portland: 1. The Blazers aren\u2019t exactly running through their set very crisply. It\u2019s fair to wonder how tired their legs are in their 13th game in 25 days, with the first 10 of those having been within five points in the last five minutes. CJ McCollum rejects a Nurkic screen to stay away from Davis and Green sticks with him to contest a tough step-back. 2. Davis deflects a long Lillard pass. After the Blazers inbound, they get their only decent catch-and-shoot look of this sequence, but (after James helps on McCollum\u2019s drive) Green does get out to contest Carmelo Anthony\u2019s left-wing 3. 3. McCollum tries to drive by Davis. Block. 4. Vogel on Davis: \u201cHe had one play where he had two deflections on both sides of the guy he was guarding [Jusuf Nurkic], and then dove on the floor and got a loose ball and got us going on the break.\u201d 5. JaVale McGee is up to keep Lillard from shooting off the screen from Hassan Whiteside, Davis rotates over to Whiteside on the roll, and Green sinks to Nurkic until McGee recovers. Anthony attacks the paint, but James stays with him to prevent an in-rhythm step-back attempt. Anthony\u2019s double-clutch attempt is well contested. 6. Davis steps up to catch Whiteside\u2019s roll down the middle of the lane, but fouls him on the shot. James immediately tells him to go straight up with his arms. Whiteside goes 0-for-2 from the line. 7. Anthony sets a screen at the elbow for Lillard, who squeezes through for a layup \u2026 which is blocked by Davis. The Blazers\u2019 spacing on that last possession was pretty poor, and Blazers coach Terry Stotts abandoned the two-center lineup shortly thereafter. Before Monday, Portland had been much better with both Nurkic and Whiteside on the floor than they\u2019d been with only one of the two. But the first 4:50 of the first quarter was all we saw of the two-center look in Game 4 (Gary Trent Jr. started the second half instead of Whiteside), and Stotts could be done with it altogether. The Blazers have faced elimination before. But that game was against the Brooklyn Nets. Game 5 on Wednesday ( 9 p.m. ET, TNT ) is against a 52-19 team that has suddenly found it\u2019s groove, and there\u2019s no word yet if Lillard will be available. \u201cIt\u2019s one game at a time,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cYou can break out all the cliches, but we know what we\u2019re up against when you\u2019re down to a good team, 3-1.\u201d Stotts can hope (and probably expect) that the Lakers won\u2019t shoot so well from the outside. But, whether or not Lillard plays, the Blazers\u2019 own offense will continue to struggle if L.A. is locked in defensively. Game 4 was the Blazers\u2019 best offensive game of the series, but the Lakers obviously took their foot off the gas pedal when they were up 38. Even with a 64-point half on Monday, the Blazers have been held under a point per possession in the series. The Lakers could earn some time off with a win on Wednesday. They would next play the winner of the Houston-Oklahoma City series, which is tied 2-2 and won\u2019t end until at least Friday. In regard to taking care of business, James was saying the right things. \u201c[Closing out] is the hardest game of a series,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you know the team that you\u2019re playing is desperate, and they\u2019re going to give you every thing that they got, because they know that they can be sent home. So I come in with that same desperate mind set.\u201d After Game 1, that desperate feeling might have come from the way the Lakers were playing. Now, the concern might be more in the minds of other teams in their path. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Every step taken, every triumph and stumble, all that transpired from the start of training camp to the season hiatus in early March to the restart of the regular season last month, it was all preparation for a moment like the one presented to the Heat on Monday. So it should come as no surprise that Bam Adebayo, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn all had their moments helping deliver the Heat\u2019s first-round sweep of the Indiana Pacers. Adebayo played huge all four games, even when his raw numbers didn\u2019t jump off the stat sheet. Particularly on nights like this one, where his 14 points, a season-high-tying 19 rebounds and six assists loomed extra large with fellow Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler limited by a sore left shoulder. Robinson triggered the franchise playoff-record 3-point barrage in Game 2 , going 7-for-8 from deep to tie Mike Miller\u2019s franchise record on his way to a playoff career-high 24 points. Herro scored a combined 36 points in Games 3 and 4, coming up with some of the biggest plays on both ends of the floor during crunch time of Monday\u2019s 99-87 series-clincher . He led a bench brigade that outscored the Heat starters at halftime, 25-23, and the Pacers\u2019 bench, 41-3, on the night. Nunn, a finalist for Kia Rookie of the Year, finally made his playoff debut Monday night, after dealing with a positive test for the coronavirus that interrupted his preparation for the playoffs as the season restarted in Orlando. The Heat simply wouldn\u2019t be headed to the conference semifinals, likely to face the No. 1 seed Milwaukee Bucks (who lead the Orlando Magic, 3-1), without the contributions of a young core group that has played beyond its collective years. \u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe love when other guys are successful. We hype them up and tell them to keep attacking, if you\u2019re getting stops keep getting stops. That\u2019s the way basketball should be played. You should have fun, you should enjoy the game. And you can see that in how we play. We share the ball, we\u2019re excited as I don\u2019t know what when somebody hits a three or D.J. [reigning AT&T Slam Dunk champion Derrick Jones Jr.] gets a big dunk or somebody takes a charge. It\u2019s so fun to play that way and I\u2019m happy we continue to play that way.\u201d Butler was on the bench during a fourth-quarter stretch when the Pacers fired everything they had to try to keep the series alive. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra went with veterans Goran Dragic, Andre Iguodala and Jae Crowder along side Adebayo and Herro to fend off the threat and give Butler extra rest. Dragic, starting in place of Nunn, scored a team-high 23 points, his fourth straight 20-point game in the series. Iguodala, the 2015 Finals MVP acquired at the trade deadline, played every fourth-quarter minute of the series. Crowder came over in the deal with Iguodala from Memphis, but watching them operate you wouldn\u2019t know that they haven\u2019t been with this team from the start. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s normal,\u201d Butler said of the Heat\u2019s next-man-up approach. \u201cIt may catch some people by surprise but I see this every single day in practice. When we don\u2019t have practice and these guys go to the gym, all year long and however many games we play. They are always taking and making big shots and in position on defense, and just playing hard, getting on the floor for loose balls. \u201cYou know, Tyler got like three offensive rebounds in a row or something like that. That\u2019s winning basketball. And we preach that to him every single day. Spo is always talking about \u2018ball in the air, ball on the floor.\u2019 That\u2019s championship habits, championship plays. Obviously, the kid can put the ball in the basket, but as long as everybody is playing hard, you can\u2019t help but to be happy for them.\u201d Spoelstra is pleased that his youngsters have continued to grow and earn their stripes, understanding exactly what awaits them the deeper this team plays into these playoffs. It\u2019s one thing for Butler, Dragic, Iguodala and Udonis Haslem to tell them about what to expect, but even more important to watch them play through those moments and do it at a high level. Adebayo\u2019s monster effort \u2014 which included six of the Heat\u2019s 17 offensive rebounds \u2014 and Herro\u2019s shot-making and defensive work on Pacers All-Star Victor Oladipo in the final minutes all resonated with Spoelstra. Now, that the Heat can move on to their next challenge. \u201c[Bam] was so big on the glass with six offensive rebounds,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201dAnd everything else on the defensive end, switching on to their guards, protecting at the rim if somebody got beat off the dribble. Trapping when necessary and then finishing off our defense with great pursuit of the ball. But that\u2019s who Bam is. He\u2019s a winner and I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s able to experience like everybody else, a first-round win where he had a major impact, I don\u2019t care what the stats said.\u201d Butler\u2019s sore shoulder forced Herro down the stretch Monday, though it was really just a continuation of his 20-point burst in Game 3. \u201cWe need him,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have it designed in our offensive system for him to be an offensive rebounder. But he went after the ball. Those were loose balls and he put his nose on it. He has a knack for being around the ball. But more importantly, he\u2019s improving defensively, he\u2019s learning what playoff basketball is all about, the intensity level anyhow every single matchup and every single possession matters, and that offensively he\u2019s a serious weapon for us. He can play off the ball for us, which is important, but he can also have the ball in his hands and make plays for our team, and that\u2019s only getting better.\u201d The Heat will need better, from the entire roster, against this Bucks team. Milwaukee brings a completely different level of competition than the game, but wounded Pacers \u2014 notably missing their best player, All-Star big man Domantas Sabonis (foot injury) \u2014 could muster. \u201cI got until midnight to enjoy this,\u201d Adebayo said of the first playoff series win of his career. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s back to business in the morning.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Behind its guards, OKC shows off its resilience in Game 4 win","content":" Oklahoma City Thunder coach Billy Donovan gathered the team at intermission in the locker room with the score tied at 60 to lay out the facts. He explained how the Thunder had surrendered eight 3-pointers in the first quarter, before limiting the Houston Rockets in the second quarter to only one bucket from long range. > Game 5: Thunder vs. Rockets, Wednesday (6:30 ET on TNT) Thunder point guard Chris Paul figured, \u201cwe were trending in the right direction.\u201d \u201cThen they came out [in the third quarter],\u201d Paul said. \u201cWham, wham, wham.\u201d Add five more whams for a more accurate depiction of the carnage wrought by the Rockets on Monday in knocking down eight consecutive 3-pointers from the start of the second half to the 2:54 mark of the third quarter in seizing a 13-point lead. Somehow Oklahoma City survived it to even this Western Conference playoff series at 2-2 by way of a 117-114 victory . Credit the Thunder for carrying the same clutch gene into the bubble at the Walt Disney World Resort that they displayed throughout the regular season. \u201cI think a lot of these guys understand now that there\u2019s so many possessions in an NBA game, and there\u2019s so much time, and people are playing so much faster that leads that years ago maybe seemed like a really difficult hill to climb, I think are certainly attainable to get back in a game,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cCertainly, you never want to be down by 13 points. But if you look at the way the game started, we kind of jumped on them. They came right back. \u2026 I mentioned emotional toughness. That\u2019s where you have to have it. They knocked down some shots, and they kind of built a lead. \u201cOur composure, and the way we stuck together, the way we encouraged each other, I thought that was really important. When you\u2019re playing against good teams, adversity is gonna come. It\u2019s all how you handle it collectively as a group.\u201d By now, nobody should be surprised by what transpired in Game 4. Remember, in Game 3 on Saturday, Oklahoma City flexed its three-guard lineup of Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder to best the Rockets 119-107 in overtime. The difference in this one is Oklahoma City didn\u2019t need an extra quarter to complete the job. After combining for 78 points in Game 3, the Thunder trio of guards came together for 74 to unseat the Rockets again, this time led by Schroder\u2019s game-high 30 points and Paul\u2019s contribution of 26, followed by Gilgeous-Alexander, who chipped in 18 points. \u201c We can\u2019t slow down,\u201d Schroder said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play fast, get stops on defense, get the rebound and just go. I think we\u2019ve got three great point guards in this league who can make decisions, who can create for each other and who can make their teammates better. We\u2019ve got to use that as our advantage. We\u2019ve been doing that all season.\u201d After starting off the third quarter 8-for-8 from 3-point range, the Rockets would cool considerably to finish the quarter at 9-for-15 beyond the arc. Oklahoma City played a major role in that, as Paul scored 14 in the third quarter to lead a 12-0 Thunder run over the last 2:54 of the frame, punctuated by a Schroder 31-footer off a Paul assist that pulled them within one point for the start of the fourth. That run served as a small piece of a larger 23-7 run that helped OKC take a 94-93 lead just 10 seconds into the fourth quarter on a Schroder driving layup. \u201cWe just relaxed,\u201d said James Harden, who scored a game-high 32 points on 11-of-25 shooting. \u201cThey\u2019re quick guards. Obviously, they\u2019re really good at getting to the paint. It\u2019s just in that third quarter, they gained confidence, and they went on a run. We just never really recovered from that. We still had opportunities in that fourth quarter, of course. We strayed away from [team principles] on both ends of the ball. So, if we don\u2019t score the basketball, then we don\u2019t get back defensively. They score, [and] they go on their run. Teams are going to make runs, but it\u2019s the way they made their run. We weren\u2019t getting our shots that we wanted, offensively. Defensively, we weren\u2019t sticking to our principles. So, it was a disaster on both ends.\u201d Houston owns the moniker of \u201cClutch City\u201d from its first NBA title back in 1994. But in this playoff series, Oklahoma City embodies it. The Thunder have done that all season, and Monday\u2019s win served simply as a continuance. Clutch time is defined as any game separated by five points or fewer in the last five minutes of the contest. So, when the clock ticked down to 5:00 in the fourth quarter on Monday, Oklahoma City found itself in familiar territory, leading by one point (103-102). \u201cBoth teams had a chance to win,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said, after his team broke its own postseason record for 3-point attempts in a playoff game (58). \u201cWe just didn\u2019t do it. We didn\u2019t get as many stops as we should\u2019ve; just so many breakdowns defensively this time. Last time, it was the offense. This time, it was a little bit of both.\u201d Mostly, it was Oklahoma City\u2019s penchant for clutch play. The Thunder entered the contest with a league-best record of 30-15 in clutch time, and Paul led the NBA in clutch-time scoring with 150 points. After Game 4, he\u2019s got 21 more of those in the 2020 playoffs. \u201cHe was great,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWith the way they\u2019re playing defense and the way we\u2019re trying to space the floor, I think he\u2019s got a really good comfort level of where his spots are gonna be. With a guy like him on the floor, with whomever it is, whether it\u2019s veteran guys or young guys, he has a way of kind of stopping runs and finding ways to generate good shots. When he\u2019s using his mind like that, he understands, \u2018OK, there\u2019s some momentum going here.\u2019 He really changed it.\u201d After falling behind 2-0 earlier in this series, Oklahoma City never showed any real concern after the losses. The club kept saying it would \u201cfigure it out.\u201d It appears the Thunder have accomplished that goal by focusing on floor spacing and attacking downhill against Houston\u2019s switching defense. Donovan surmised that \u201cif you can space it correctly, even if you don\u2019t get to the rim, you can get some kick-out shots.\u201d Now, it\u2019s time for the Rockets to make adjustments. Rockets point guard Russell Westbrook hasn\u2019t played in a game since Aug. 11, due to a strained right quadriceps muscle, and we\u2019re all aware that the best way for a player to round himself into proper conditioning is to actually play live games. Westbrook provided a glimpse of encouragement before Game 4 by taking part in a strenuous workout on the court. Still, he\u2019s missed six consecutive games, and eight of the team\u2019s last nine overall dating back to the NBA restart. Meanwhile, Harden, who already has a reputation for running out of gas in the postseason, has logged 34 minutes or more in every game this series, including a series-high 42:49 in Game 4. The Rockets are now 4-6 this season in games decided by three points or fewer, while OKC is 9-6 in those scenarios. Paul chuckled at first thinking back to Houston\u2019s third-quarter eruption from deep, before recognizing the significance of OKC\u2019s moxie in evening up the series 2-2. \u201cThat was crazy to tell you the truth,\u201d Paul said. \u201c I think our team all season has dealt with adversity really, really [well]. We were just trying to keep playing, keep fighting, and stayed in the game.  We just knew we had to take our shots when they were there. They were sort of just giving us the open 3s [over the first two games]. And each game was different. We have some dynamic guards. I\u2019m probably not dynamic. But Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] and Dennis [Schroder] are. So, we know that if we can give those guys space, they can get downhill.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

It\u2019s been written, edited and posted, like it or not, regardless of any potential redundancy. As long as Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton keeps having to be reminded that he can and should shoot the basketball whenever he\u2019s on a court, we\u2019ll keep writing this. And you\u2019ll keep getting dragged along until Middleton\u2019s next refresher course. > Game 5: Bucks vs. Magic; Wednesday, 4 ET on NBA TV The most recent session came Monday afternoon at The Field House on the Walt Disney World campus, where the Bucks battled the Orlando Magic in Game 4 of their first-round series . For 15 quarters \u2014 the first three games, plus three-fourths of this 121-106 victory \u2014 Middleton largely had receded. His numbers were unbecoming of a two-time NBA All-Star: 11.0 points, 32% shooting overall, 29% on 3-pointers, even 57% on his modest seven free throws. This, from a guy who flirted with rare \u201c50-40-90\u201d status (Middleton would have had it if three more of his 947 field goal attempts had hit, boosting him from 49.7% to 50% overall.) Sure, Middleton was playing hard and even contributing in ways other from scoring \u2014 though referring to his Game 2 performance (1-for-8, 2 points) as \u201cgreat\u201d sounded silly. But the way this Milwaukee thing works is A-B-C: Giannis Antetokounmpo attacks in the lane, shooters around the arc draw out defenders to open space for the Greek Freak and Middleton serves as the release valve, capable of initiating runs, salvaging possessions or anything in between, from anywhere in the offensive zone. Middleton is not a luxury. He is a necessity if the Bucks are going to hit their opponents hard enough to reach and maybe win The Finals later next month. So that\u2019s what they told their drifting teammate after three quarters, by which time Milwaukee\u2019s nine-point lead had dwindled to 84-81. \u201cI told him when we came off, \u2018Shoot the ball. Till your arms fall off. Just keep being aggressive,\u2019 \u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201c \u2018Just shoot it, every time.\u2019 \u201cWe need him to do that. This game, the next game, also as long as the playoffs go.\u201d To that point, Middleton had missed eight of his nine shots, including three of his four 3-pointers. He had eight rebounds and three assists, so he was contributing. But with just three points, he was getting outscored by 17 of the other 19 players who had broken a sweat to that point. \u201cThat\u2019s been something [they] have been telling me since Day One here in Milwaukee,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cNo matter how I\u2019ve been shooting, I\u2019ve got to keep shooting. That\u2019s the only way it\u2019s going to go in.\u201d Funny how that works. Middleton nailed a 3-pointer on a feed from Antetokounmpo that made it 92-83. Then a jumper, followed by two more 3-pointers. He scored 16 of the Bucks\u2019 18 points in a span of 5:37, even allowing Antetokounmpo to grab a couple minutes on the bench. His step-back jumper over Evan Fournier made it 107-97, a lead Milwaukee was able to manage to the end. Thanks to those 12 minutes \u2014 Middleton added two late free throws \u2014 his final line of 21 points, 10 rebounds and four 3-pointers was more appropriate for his team\u2019s second-best player. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it before each game, and between games,\u201d said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201c\u2018We think it\u2019s just a matter of time for him.\u2019 \u201cFor his stick-to-itiveness and for him to just stay the course, keep playing, keep competing \u2026 His mindset\u2019s been good.\u201d Fine. But this isn\u2019t Middleton\u2019s first rodeo, bubble or not. There have been scoring and shooting shrinkage before. His standard-deviation problem really was glaring in the 2019 Eastern Conference finals against Toronto, when he put up games of 11, 12, 9, 30, six and 14 points. The Bucks dropped the last four, abruptly beginning their summer, with Middleton limited by the Raptors to 13.7 points on 41% shooting. In the three series he played prior to that, 16 games across 2018 and 2019, he averaged 21.6 points on 50.4% shooting. Still, when you\u2019re a 29-year-old, eight seasons into an NBA career, with two All-Star appearances made possible by coaches who are quite clear in what they value about Middleton, should it really take another pep talk on the fly, in between quarters of a playoff game, to snap him back? The five-year, $177 million contract extension he signed last summer should be screaming \u201cShoot! Again!\u201d at him from morning till night. \u201cAt times I think I\u2019m unselfish,\u201d Middleton said after Milwaukee went up 3-1, with a chance to eliminate the Magic Wednesday ( 4 ET, NBA TV ). \u201cAnd then there\u2019s times where I think I have to force the issue, and I think that\u2019s what they wanted me to do. Or at least start doing.\u201d Better yet for the Bucks, keep doing it. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Lakers won Game 4 in a romp, 135-115 , to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round series with the Blazers. The Lakers wore their \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d jerseys in honor of Kobe Bryant as the uniforms also sported a special patch bearing the number 2 inside a heart to honor Gianna Bryant. LeBron James took note when the Lakers built an early 24-8 lead over the Trail Blazers on Kobe Bryant Day. \u201cOK, he\u2019s here in the building,\u201d James said he thought in the moment, when the two numbers that Bryant wore during his career appeared on the scoreboard. \u201cTo be able to continue his legacy is something that hits home for me, and it\u2019s easy for me because I put in the work,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd if you want to see results you got to work at it. It\u2019s not about the wins and losses.\u201d Inspired by Bryant, the Lakers\u2019 24-8 lead seemed fortuitous, and they went on to outscore the Blazers 43-25 in the first quarter. The Lakers led 80-51 at the half. It was the most points in a half for Los Angeles in a playoff game since 1987. Kobe Bryant, the 18-time All-Star who won five NBA championships and became one of the greatest basketball players of his generation during a 20-year career with the Lakers, died in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020. He was 41 and what would have been his 42nd birthday was Aug. 23. The Aug. 24 date is significant because the numerical month that corresponds to August (8) and the day (24) are the two numbers Bryant wore during his Hall of Fame career with the Lakers. Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, was also killed in that January helicopter crash along with seven others on board. She was known for wearing the No. 2 during her burgeoning basketball career . In the 2020 All-Star Game , Team LeBron (No. 2) and Team Giannis (No. 24) honored Kobe and Gianna by having every player on those respective teams wear those uniform numbers.

The basketball ripple created by the team with the NBA\u2019s best record also travels south of Milwaukee, just down I-94 to Kenosha, where it\u2019s very unlikely that folks there are discussing how the Bucks are surging in these NBA playoffs, or even care right now. That relatively small, blue-collar town is dealing with a more pressing issue, one that has captured the attention of the Bucks as well. As the NBA season restarted in Orlando, the intersection with social justice was mostly confined to messages on the backs of jerseys, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d being tattooed on the basketball court and the anthem kneeling. Until now. Until a shooting Sunday evening in Kenosha resonated beyond state lines and reached these protesting NBA teams at Disney, especially the one that calls Wisconsin home. Jacob Blake lies hospitalized in stable condition after being shot in the back multiple times by police while opening a car door in Kenosha. Video of the 29-year-old collapsing became a social media flashpoint, and protests quickly organized well before the mid-afternoon tipoff between the Bucks and Orlando Magic. The Bucks are up 3-1 on the Magic after Monday\u2019s win. Giannis Antetokounmpo joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to average 30-plus points, 15-plus rebounds and five-plus assists through their first four games of a postseason. Wesley Matthews, raised in Wisconsin, emerged as a 3-point weapon and complement to Giannis. Khris Middleton, the key co-star, broke out of his slump. And none of it feels truly topical. \u201cAnother black man was shot by a police officer,\u201d said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cAn incident like this is more important than anything we\u2019re doing in Orlando.\u201d The shooting was preceded by several prominent incidences of police violence this year, tragedies that caused rage around the country all summer and raised awareness to them. To NBA players committing to social justice as part of the Orlando restart, it felt like more of the same. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s happened in my community,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cI\u2019ve had two incidents in Charleston, S.C., in the church and a one-arm black man running away from police. It\u2019s up to our police departments to stop shooting us, simple as that. There\u2019s other ways to de-escalate the situation. \u201cThis is why we have so many people outraged over the country. The man was shot point-blank range over seven times in the back. It doesn\u2019t get any more sickening than that. People are starting to see why black people are so afraid of police because at any time, no matter what they did right or wrong, their first act is to shoot us. That\u2019s a very scary situation to be in, when they\u2019re supposed to protect us.\u201d The NBA players suspect their very vivid and vocal embrace of social justice is being met by indifference or scorn in certain circles beyond Orlando. In addition to the kneeling, jerseys and the buttons worn by every coach, players often pepper their answers to basketball questions with comments highlighting racial injustice. Yes, Bucks guard George Hill was emotional after the game when he said: \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything here,\u201d and added, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have even came to this damn place, to be honest. I think coming here just took all the focal points off what the issues are.\u201d But NBA players overwhelmingly chose to play in Orlando in order to maximize their platform, which was heartedly endorsed and encouraged by the league. Not only have the usual suspects been very open \u2014 LeBron James and Chris Paul among them \u2014 but the message is being sent by players at the end of the benches. And Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle opens every press conference with a statement on social justice before taking any questions. The biggest star on the Bucks and the reigning MVP explained he hadn\u2019t studied the incident and wanted more information before commenting. That\u2019s prudent, especially for someone who isn\u2019t from these shores. One of the greatest Bucks prior to Giannis\u2019 arrival \u2014 Hall of Famer Ray Allen \u2014 was ready to speak his mind, and did so in an impassioned social media post : The shooting is now under investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Officers in Kenosha responded to calls of a domestic incident. Video shows Blake walking away from officers who are pointing their weapons at him to open the door of a car. The three officers were placed on administrative leave. Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who galvanized his fellow coaches prior to the restart and encouraged them to speak out against injustice, sounded weary when Kenosha was raised. Rivers attended college in Milwaukee, at Marquette. \u201cYeah, I mean, we\u2019ve been processing the Wisconsin situation now for 58 years,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThat\u2019s how old I am. And it just keeps happening over and over again. It\u2019s just sad. I mean, it is. It\u2019s just sad. That\u2019s how I process it. It\u2019s just tough, man.\u201d Kneeling during the anthem had a more meaningful feel Monday for the team based an hour north of Kenosha. For the first time during the restart, an NBA team felt the sting of tragedy close to home, and to the Bucks, it justified their daily protests in Orlando. Budenholzer said: \u201cThere was a lot of talk that we needed to continue this conversation and be better as a country and not have any more of these incidents and that Black lives matter. We need to find systemic change that is lasting. We need to be better. I\u2019m hoping for the best as we work though this in Wisconsin and Milwaukee and Kenosha.\u201d The Bucks are one win away from advancing to the next round, thanks to a spirited effort against the Magic that will not be the talk throughout the state today. \u201cTo almost take a guy\u2019s life, thank God he\u2019s still alive,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI know the cops are probably upset he\u2019s still alive, because I know they surely tried to kill him. But to almost take a man\u2019s life, especially in front of one\u2019s kids, that wasn\u2019t resisting in his back at point-blank range, is a heartless and gutless situation. We need some justice for that.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

It\u2019s also the only piece of sports memorabilia I own, unless you count a sweaty wristband from Angel McCoughtry, the WNBA star. I should explain. I was at the WNBA All-Star Game years ago, and the players were tossing items into the stands during a timeout. I had my back turned, and McCoughtry threw her orange wristband and hit me in the head, and my daughter got the rebound. We decided to place the wristband on the Shaq mannequin, all in the name of gender equality. I\u2019m not sure what the Shaq stuff might fetch on the open market, and it doesn\u2019t matter since it\u2019s not for sale, but then I visit the NBA Auctions website and start to wonder. The league, in conjunction with the National Basketball Players Association, is auctioning the social justice game-worn jerseys worn on reopening weekend by the 340-plus players on the 22 teams that participated here at Walt Disney World. The proceeds will be donated to the Players\u2019 Justice Fund . They make for a nice collectable because you\u2019ll probably never see \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cVote\u201d on the back of jerseys again, or my personal favorite, \u201cRavnoprovnost\u201d which is Bosian for \u201cEquality\u201d and worn proudly by Jusuf Nurkic. LeBron James doesn\u2019t have a social justice message on his jersey, and apparently that\u2019s not swaying the bidders, because the price is currently at $45,520 and there\u2019s still three days left in the Lakers\u2019 auction. Most of the serious bidders wait until the last minute to show their hand, so expect that price to double at the very least. Assuming LeBron\u2019s very special jersey, which says \u201cJames\u201d on the back and is no different than his others except the name is stitched below the number, goes beyond $100,000, I\u2019d have some \u2018splanin to do with the family if I mortgaged the house for that. I might be forced to live inside the jersey as a result.  I\u2019m not one to tell anyone how to spend their money, unless they\u2019re giving some to me, but five and six figures for a jersey means people have too much disposable income. I realize it\u2019s an investment; it\u2019s just that autographs and jerseys and sneakers were supposed to be personal, like proof of a brief interaction with an athlete, and kept for life. However, at the risk of sounding like a hypocrite: I do own a game-worn jersey from the Atlanta Hawks media pickup game that I\u2019d be willing to autograph and sell to anyone who\u2019ll pay LeBron James money for it. OK, half. So, to recap: I wouldn\u2019t mind owning one of those restart jerseys for the historical significance. The jersey of Brian Bowen II of the Pacers that says \u201cVote\u201d isn\u2019t in much demand right now \u2014 I could find the $220 for that \u2014 and maybe a few other jerseys from lesser-known players could fall into my price range. Unless of course, my brilliant and understanding supervisor Steve Quintana \u2014 did I mention he\u2019s brilliant? \u2014 could conclude that an auctioned jersey belonging to LeBron qualifies as a necessary business item and therefore I can expense it. After all, I\u2019m writing about it. Yes, right next to \u201cmeals\u201d and \u201cmileage\u201d I can make note of this in miscellaneous: \u201cLeBron James jersey, $100,000.00.\u201d I\u2019m sure the bean counters in payroll won\u2019t even do a double take. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Even if the difference in the outcome \u2014 a 129-127 Jazz victory to take a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series \u2014 was tucked quietly away as usual, in not-sexy-at-all monochrome. Hardly noticeable, in fact, what with Donovan Mitchell scoring 51 points for the Jazz. And Jamal Murray countering with 50 for the Nuggets . That\u2019s the first time in NBA playoff history two opponents each scored 50 or more in the same game. That turned the game at AdventHealth Arena on the Walt Disney World campus into something fit for Elgin Baylor vs. Rick Barry, Larry Bird battling Dominique Wilkins or LeBron James going against Stephen Curry. There was more: One hundred shots up for Denver, 57.5% accuracy for Utah. Nikola Jokic with 29 points in support of Murray, 26 for the Jazz by \u201cDad of the bubble\u201d Mike Conley. The Nuggets grabbing 17 offensive rebounds, while dishing 25 assists to a mere six turnovers. Thirty-one points off Utah\u2019s bench. And then you spot it, the disparity that Denver could not overcome: The Jazz went 31-for-36 at the free throw line, while the Nuggets went 12-for-13. In an exciting game decided by two points with historic individual scoring performances, Utah outscored Denver by 19 when no one was defending. That\u2019s a deflating kind of dominance asserted over his team, and Denver coach Michael Malone afterward wasn\u2019t interested in talking about it. \u201cWe\u2019ve struggled to get to the line,\u201d Malone said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to comment on that. I\u2019m not giving the league any of my money.\u201d The NBA is rather famous for fining coaches, executives and players who publicly air their gripes with officiating. But anyone who watched \u2014 certainly anyone who goes back to break down the game video \u2014 will see two teams playing distinct styles, running their offenses from different places on the floor and all but blowing the referees\u2019 whistles for them. Denver launched jump shots, Utah attacked the paint out of pick-and-rolls. The former took advantage of some shoddy contesting, especially in the first half, by Jazz defenders to get into a rhythm on the perimeter and tended to stay out there. The latter put the ball in Mitchell\u2019s hands seemingly every trip downcourt and had him slice into Denver\u2019s defense. It has been a problem for the Nuggets all series. In four games, they have been outscored 82-54 from the line \u2014 that\u2019s an average of 7 ppg \u2014 while shooting 37 fewer free throws. Mitchell is 42 of 44 from the line, almost lapping by himself Denver\u2019s star tandem of Murray (10 of 10) and Jokic (13 of 17). In Game 4, Murray went 5-for-5 on free throws. He maybe should have had two more \u2014 not that Malone was saying anything about it \u2014 when he did drive hard to the rim with about a half minute to play and Utah up 124-120. Murray was met there by Rudy Gobert, who did the right thing by leaping straight up, arms raised high. But as Murray, the Utah center did violate the \u201cverticality\u201d standard, bringing his left hand down across Murray\u2019s right arm. No call, though, so Denver\u2019s last chance to pull within a single possession went poof! Murray wasn\u2019t reluctant to plead his case then or for most of the night, one time showing one of the officials two fingerprint scratches on the back of his arm to indicate some serious uncalled contact. It\u2019s different and pricier, though, at podium time. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speak on it. I don\u2019t want to get fined,\u201d he said. For Denver, being on the short end of free points is typical. It ranked 25th and 26th, in the regular season in free throws made and taken, respectively. Jokic\u2019s 301 free throw attempts ranked 30th in the NBA, while Murray was 80th with 185. Jokic\u2019s two free throws Sunday in more than 39 minutes were conspicuously insufficient. Considering backup Jazz center Tony Bradley shot four while playing less than nine minutes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to find a way to help Nikola,\u201d Malone said of that issue in particular. Jazz coach Quin Snyder was buoyant by comparison, as beneficiaries of refs\u2019 whistles often are. \u201cHe really attacked the basket,\u201d Snyder said of Mitchell, who made 17 of his 18 foul shots. \u201cThat\u2019s something he\u2019s worked on and thought about a lot. For him to get to the line, that makes him tougher to defend.\u201d And with Mitchell playing that way since Game 1, who can blame Denver defenders if they\u2019ve grown weary of those unwelcome meetings near the basket and seek out some contact? It\u2019s a Jazz thing, part of grinding in their halfcourt offense. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing, if the shots aren\u2019t there, to attack the rim,\u201d Snyder said. Mitchell, who also scored 57 in the opener Monday, has joined Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players to score at least 50 points more than once in a playoff series. He is 1-1 in those games, however, just as Murray now is 0-1 when going for 50. Seems like the quieter ones, with everyone standing around, are the ones doing the real damage here. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

'Playoff P', missing in action for LA","content":" Sugar coating the obvious is a waste of time for Paul George right now. The LA Clippers don\u2019t have time to overthink it anyway. Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks made sure of it Sunday, winning a wild overtime Game 4 thriller over the Clippers to even their first round playoff series at 2-2. George wasn\u2019t anywhere near Doncic on the game-winning shot at the buzzer \u2014 Reggie Jackson will have the honor of being immortalized forever as the victim on that highlight-reel play. But George might as well have been the defender whose outstretched arm didn\u2019t reach the target. Because no matter how many times his coaches and teammates insist that their current predicament isn\u2019t the responsibility of just one player or one moment, George knows better. The player who wore the \u201cPlayoff P\u201d moniker with pride while producing at the highest level in the past, has been missing in action against the Mavericks. \u201cIf I make shots, this series could be a little different,\u201d George said after his 3-for-14 shooting effort (1-for-7 from beyond the 3-point line) in the 135-133 Game 4 loss . \u201cAnd that\u2019s the obvious, of course. That\u2019s just what it comes down to. But give them credit, they are playing well. They are shooting the ball. Luka is playing phenomenal. You\u2019ve got to give credit where credit\u2019s due. But to be honest, in hindsight, if I shoot the ball better this series would be a lot different.\u201d Give George credit for being as brutally honest in his assessment of his own play as one could be after his woeful performance in the past three games. The numbers are ugly \u2014 11.3 points on 21% shooting from the floor, including 16% from 3-point range. This from a player with a career playing scoring average of 20 ppg on 42% shooting, (35.8% on 3-pointers). This from a player who has averaged 22.6 ppg or better, including a career-high 28.6 ppg last season with the Thunder, in each of his past five playoff appearances. George has the lowest effective field goal percentage (34.8%) of any player in the playoffs with at least 50 shot attempts. The Mavericks have one established superstar and another potential one in Kristaps Porzingis, who didn\u2019t play Sunday because of a knee injury and missed the second half of Game 1 after being ejected with two technical fouls. The Clippers are supposed to have two set in stone: reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and George, who finished third in the Kia MVP balloting last season. It hasn\u2019t looked that way in this series, though. And George knows it. There is no refuge on the NBA campus in Orlando, where the scrutiny form the rest of the players from the 15 other playoff teams are roaming the same grounds, not to mention eyeballing the same social media chatter. So while he insists that he\u2019s not internalizing the struggles, his actions on the court say otherwise. If ever there was an opportunity to play your way out a slump it was Sunday, when the Clippers led by 21 early. It didn\u2019t happen. \u201cI just got to stay with it,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon man. I just got to stay with it. I thought early on I got a rhythm and then towards the third quarter I just got out of rhythm and I was just trying to find it. But you know, it was tough. It\u2019s just tough for me right now. It\u2019s hard to say, because I\u2019m getting the looks and the shots, the floor is open and the defenders aren\u2019t great. But I\u2019m just having a hard time finding the ball through right now.\u201d After watching his team lose that big lead and ultimately lose the game, Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who routinely praises his crew\u2019s mental toughness, said they played \u201cemotionally weak.\u201d It\u2019s an assessment George didn\u2019t necessarily agree with when asked about it. Leonard, however, agreed with Rivers, while maintaining full support for the other half of the Clippers\u2019 dynamic duo as George tries to regain his form. He doesn\u2019t have any magic tricks for turning it around, just staying the course and leaning into what he\u2019s always done. \u201cJust tell him to keep going and his time is coming,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cHe missed some easy looks tonight. But everybody did. It\u2019s not his fault. We were up big in that second quarter and everybody has a part in winning the basketball game.\u201d George doesn\u2019t need any pep talks anyway. He\u2019s beyond that. Again, his confidence in himself, in his game, has not wavered. \u201cYeah, I play the game confidently,\u201d George said. \u201cThe shots I\u2019m taking I\u2019m expecting to make. It just \u2026 is what it is. I\u2019m just missing shots and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s from a confidence standpoint. Because once I see it go through and I find that rhythm, I\u2019ll be right where I want to be. The problem is just getting to that point. \u201cUsually you\u2019re in a hostile environment and that helps you get into that moment. And so, I just have to find that, you know, just find that while I\u2019m out on that floor in that environment. And I\u2019ll battle through it, I\u2019ll fight through it. I gotta help the team, I\u2019m aware of that. And I\u2019ll get to that point.\u201d The Mavericks\u2019 confidence grows each and every minute they go toe-to-toe with the favored Clippers. George needs to find that point. Soon. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

When Murray\u2019s 3-pointer swished to set the final margin in Utah\u2019s 129-127 Game 4 victory , it boosted him to 50 points on the night, making this the first game in NBA postseason history that opposing players each reached that threshold. It also made him the first Nuggets player to reach that mark in the playoffs since Dnever joined the NBA in 1976-77. Mitchell, who had crossed 50 and landed on 51 at the free-throw line seconds earlier, became just the third player in NBA history to score 50 more than once in the same series, joining Michael Jordan (vs. Cleveland, 1988) and Allen Iverson (vs. Toronto, 2001). Some other notes on the dueling 50-point performances: * Murray\u2019s 50-point performance marks a new Nuggets franchise record for points in a postseason game. No Nuggets player has scored 50+ points in a playoff game since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976-77. * Mitchell\u2019s 158 points is the most for any player in a four-game span within a single postseason, since Michael Jordan scored 173 points in the last four games of the 1993 Finals. * After tonight\u2019s 51-point outing, Mitchell is averaging 39.5 ppg plus 5.8 apg while shooting 51.4% from 3-point range, 56.4% overall and 95.5% from the line. His scoring average currently leads the playoffs. * Iverson had a pair of games with 50 or more points in the 2001 playoffs, while Jordan accomplished the feat in \u201988 and \u201993. Mitchell previously ripped off 57 in a Game 1 loss. Utah now leads the series, 3-1. Game 5 is set for Tuesday at 6:30 ET (TNT).

But it\u2019s accurate to declare what he just did was legendary. Once you apply the context of a throbbing left ankle he badly sprained 40 hours earlier, and the absence of his Mavericks co-star, and the constant hounding from defenders who yapped in his ear and poked his body, does anyone dare question this ? It was a basketball composition beautifully scripted and performed and finished. It was the full and total picture of brilliance, right down to the final buzzer in overtime, when the winning jumper fell softly through the net and teammates rushed at full sprint for a hard embrace. Luka Doncic, on Aug. 23, 2020, against the Clippers is worthy and deserving of your historical consideration: 43 points, 17 rebounds, 13 assists and one cold-blooded dagger straight through the heart of a title contender. \u201cJust a very, very special player,\u201d said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, \u201cand this game today was from another planet.\u201d With 3.7 seconds left and the Mavericks needing to inbounds the ball, the most important task was getting it to Doncic. Once that was done, the success rate for Dallas soared immediately. Doncic is only 21 but brings the wisdom of a basketball Buddha. Before getting the ball, Doncic managed to get the switch he wanted, shaking free of Kawhi Leonard on the screen and seeing Reggie Jackson instead. The importance of that cannot be overstated; Kawhi is a supreme defender and Jackson is \u2026 Jackson. \u201cHe reads those situations well,\u201d said Carlisle. \u201cHe\u2019s such a smart player. He sees things before other people see them. That\u2019s one of the reasons he\u2019s so special. He\u2019s got the skill set, the strength and size but it\u2019s also the way he computes the game. He sees the game in 6G, not 5G. It\u2019s another level beyond what most people see.\u201d So Doncic isolated, calmly took took a few crossover dribbles, had Jackson shook on his heels and then let it fly. Just moments before, Marcus Morris put the Clippers up a point and that threatened to spoil a remarkable Mavericks rally from 21 points down, in a second half they totally controlled. The walk to the huddle was sluggish for Dallas. \u201cEverybody was a little down,\u201d said guard Trey Burke. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to go down to the last shot, but big-time players make big-time plays. And he\u2019s already a great player.\u201d Doncic has the Clippers, now tied 2-2, befuddled and bamboozled. He\u2019s breaking down his man, forcing fouls, drawing double teams and mismatches, finding teammates with zip passes for open looks, getting inside for layups, stepping back for threes and forcing the Clippers to rewrite their strategy report on the fly. He averaged 30 points in the first two games, and the Clippers are now feeling fortunate his third game was cut short. He\u2019s unraveling them mentally as well. Some Clippers are trying to throw him off by getting physical and discreetly taunting him, hoping to take advantage of his youth and lack of playoff experience. In the previous game, Montrezl Harrell was so overjoyed to score against Doncic that the Clippers\u2019 forward screamed at Doncic, calling him \u201cwhite boy\u201d and peppering the comment with an expletive. It was playground talk made inappropriate and off-message given what the NBA is pushing right now: Racial equality, understanding and togetherness. Just a poor look. Harrell tried to make peace with Doncic before tipoff. Doncic brushed the comment aside, refusing to make it an issue, but Burke said Doncic definitely bites on the challenge. \u201cHe don\u2019t back down from nobody,\u201d Burke said. \u201cDon\u2019t matter who\u2019s talking to him. It kind of raises his level of play. Tonight that\u2019s what happened. Luka raised his level, like a star should, and we followed behind him.\u201d After that apology, Harrell mustered two points and one rebound in 17 minutes. \u201cJust basketball motivates me,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI know they\u2019re going to be talking to me and trying to take me out of my game. It\u2019s going to be this every game.\u201d The Mavericks were without Kristaps Porzingis, who sat because of soreness in his non-surgically-repaired knee, and with only one day\u2019s rest between playoff games is uncertain for Game 4. When the Clippers seized control early \u2014 Doncic appeared tentative on the ankle \u2014 this game had the makings of a rout. About that ankle: When it folded Friday night, Doncic limped off the floor, then returned, yet was clearly limping and unable to pivot before he removed himself for good from Game 3. The turnaround time between games was short, and Carlisle was leery. \u201cHe\u2019s got such a great heart,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cIf he was able to feel anything close to decent I thought he\u2019d probably play. Guys like him, Jason Kidd, Larry Bird, these kind of guys are such great competitors. Not much will keep them from competing. They\u2019re from the same fabric in terms of their ability to impact the game in unique forms. It\u2019s not just about putting the ball in the basket. It\u2019s about giving teammates confidence.\u201d Doncic became springy and gained confidence as the game progressed and the Clippers\u2019 lead vaporized. He said: \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t 100-percent.\u201d Then he smiled: \u201cBut I think it was good.\u201d In such a short time, Doncic has flourished to meet the demands of the NBA game, learned the nuances, embraced the culture and after this will certainly demand respect from perhaps the two or three people on the planet who are still withholding judgment. He can excel in the half court game that dominates in the playoffs. He has floor vision and understands the flow and rhythm of the game and the weaknesses of the team he\u2019s playing against. He\u2019s 6-foot-7 and uses his body well. Mainly, Doncic doesn\u2019t sense fear or urgency and is unimpressed by pressure situations. \u201cHe also has a flair for the dramatic,\u201d said Carlisle. \u201cHe\u2019s a performer as well as being a great player. He\u2019s a guy who lives for these moments. He\u2019s completely fearless.\u201d Doncic, remember, is just 21, started shaving a few years ago, is barely old enough to order from the bar, couldn\u2019t watch NBA games in Slovenia up until a few years ago because they were televised at 3 a.m. local time and he had to get ready for school \u2026 and yet he\u2019s already a man in a man\u2019s league. He\u2019s also trying to process this basketball blizzard he finds himself in, especially that last shot. \u201cI can\u2019t explain the emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only when the ball goes in but when the whole team comes toward me, it\u2019s one of the best feelings ever, something special.\u201d What he did Sunday was special, aligned right along with the all-time playoff performances by players who had the benefit of healthier ankles. Doncic went supernova on the Clippers by confronting the challenge through four quarters and an extra period. And then? \u201cAt the end,\u201d Carlisle said, \u201cit was all about finding a way to get the ball in his hands and letting him to decide things. That\u2019s what this kid is all about.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

"},{"id":26237,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/3-takeaways-celtics-sixers-game-4-sweep","date":"2020-08-24","title":"3 takeaways from Celtics' sweep of Sixers","content":" The Boston Celtics completed the first sweep in 15 postseason meetings against the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday with a 110-106 win to take  the opening round series 4-0. The Celtics now await the winner of the first-round series between Toronto and Brooklyn for a matchup expected to take place later this week in the Eastern Conference semifinals. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s much to celebrate,\u201d said Kemba Walker, who scored a game-high 32 points. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do much yet. It\u2019s a great thing that we were able to beat that team. It does feel good. But we know it\u2019s not over.\u201d Perhaps for both squads, Sunday\u2019s outcome marked a beginning, as Boston looks to advance to the conference finals for the first time since 2018, while Philadelphia ponders what\u2019s next after failing to make it past the second round of the playoffs for a third consecutive season. We\u2019ll get into that with three takeaways from this game: Over the course of seven days, Walker won more playoff games (4) with the Celtics than he did in the previous eight years as a member of the Charlotte Hornets (3). Interestingly, Walker woke up Sunday morning feeling \u201ca little under the weather,\u201d according to Celtics coach Brad Stevens. Walker participated in the team\u2019s early walkthrough workout, then skipped Boston\u2019s film session to get checked out by team doctors. Walker described it as an \u201cupset stomach,\u201d but it didn\u2019t stop him from putting together just the third 30-point playoff game of his career. \u201cI was just trying to play basketball the right way, which I try to do each and every night,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhatever opportunities they gave me and that I [saw], I tried to take advantage of it as best as I can. Sometimes, they were back. So, I went to my pull-up. If they were up, I tried to get around the big and get to the basket. If not, draw defenders, and kick it out to my teammates and let those guys do the rest of the work. So, just trying to play basketball the right way.\u201d It\u2019s obviously working as Walker increased his production in each of Boston\u2019s four series victories. Walker scored 19 points in Game 1, and then followed that up with 22 points and 24 points in the next two games before Sunday\u2019s 32-point outburst. Walker scored 20 points in the first half alone, shooting 5-for-7 from the floor and 3-for-5 from 3-point range. \u201cWe know that\u2019s a big reason why Kemba came here: he wanted to be a part of something special,\u201d said Jayson Tatum, who scored 28 points to go with a career-high 15 rebounds. \u201cHe wanted to win. As happy as I am that we won, I\u2019m even happier that he\u2019s getting the chance to experience this.\u201d The Boston Celtics athletic training staff deserves some of the credit. When the season resumed, the team placed Walker on a minutes restriction due to lingering soreness in his left knee, and gradually ramped up the point guard\u2019s work as the postseason approached. \u201cI give a lot of credit to our trainers,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey executed that plan. That\u2019s not easy to do. He didn\u2019t like playing limited minutes building up. He didn\u2019t like not practicing. But [he] got the knee stronger, got ready to go for trying to be the best that we could be on Aug. 17. He was great tonight. He\u2019ll have to continue to be really good.\u201d With 2:40 left to play in the third quarter and Philadelphia trailing by three points, Tatum drove to the basket with Harris defending. As Tatum flew to the basket, his legs and momentum swept Harris\u2019 feet from underneath him, sending the 76ers forward crashing face first into the hardwood. \u201cIt got quiet,\u201d Tatum said. Harris stayed down for a few minutes next to a pool of his own blood, as athletic trainers called for help. Harris eventually walked off the court and received stitches over his left eye in the locker room. Athletic trainers also evaluated Harris for a possible concussion. \u201cI\u2019m still in some pain with it,\u201d Harris said after the game. \u201cIt was a hard fall for sure. My ribs are kind of affected.\u201d The 76ers as whole suffered the most from that point forward, as Boston reeled off a 16-2 run from the 2:40 mark of the third quarter to the 9:34 point of the final frame. Tatum poured in 10 points over that span. Surprisingly, Harris reentered the game the game with 5:12 left to play, but by then, Philadelphia trailed by 12 points. Before the injury, the largest Boston lead was 5 points. \u201cI feel like the game flipped when Tobias went out,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cI think that they went on a 16-2 run during that period. At that moment, the game changed. Up until that moment I felt pretty good about what we were doing. Him coming back out after he took an incredibly hard fall did not surprise me.\u201d Still, Harris\u2019 injury resulted in a major momentum swing. It also took some of the shine of Harris\u2019 performance. Coming into the game, Harris was 0-for-10 on 3-pointers in this series, while averaging 14.3 points. Harris finished Game 4 with 20 points and knocked down 2-of-5 from range. \u201cIt was very unfortunate,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI was glad he was alright, able to come back and play.\u201d We all know about \u201cThe Process,\u201d but another one could be coming this offseason for Philadelphia after it suffered the franchise\u2019s first sweep in the first round of a best-of-seven series. The Sixers endured a first-round sweep to the New York Knicks during the 1988-89 season, but that was best-of-five. Either way, changes could be on the way as Brown now owns a postseason record of 12-14 during his seven-year tenure in Philadelphia. His future as head coach appears to be in jeopardy. You could almost see that being the case Sunday with 11.7 seconds left to play as Sixers general manager Elton Brand walked off the court wearing a mask with both hands stuffed into his pockets. Guard Josh Richardson\u2019s postgame remarks certainly won\u2019t help. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019s a good man, he means well,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI just think going forward, he\u2019s got to have some more accountability. I don\u2019t think there was much accountability this season, and I think that was part of our problem.\u201d Asked how the team could establish an expectation of accountability, Richardson said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start from scratch, and it\u2019s not going to be easy. It\u2019s not gonna be easy and we\u2019re not gonna be comfortable. But that\u2019s what championship teams do. [When] guys are not doing their jobs on or off the court, there\u2019s got to be some kind of consequence, not consequence, but we\u2019ve got to be able to talk to each other and listen. \u201cAnd not listen to say something back, but actually hear. It\u2019s a hard lesson to learn for some people, but in order for us to make this playoff run that I think we all want, I know we all want, it\u2019s got to start.\u201d Brown, meanwhile, tried to avoid discussing his future. Brown did reflect on a Sixers season rife with inconsistency and injuries. The team\u2019s top perimeter defender, Ben Simmons, suffered a subluxation of his left patella on Aug. 5 that kept him out of Philadelphia\u2019s first-round series. \u201cThis season to me was riddled with an amazing abundance of injuries,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis season was a challenge trying to put people where they should\u2019ve been placed. I liked where we ended up, getting Ben off-ball, and the things he did as a sort of 4-man. We all get he\u2019s an NBA All-Star, who\u2019s a point guard. It shows his versatility. \u201cEnding with Ben\u2019s injury this year, you just really never felt like you jumped into a routine and a rhythm. That\u2019s probably the thought that will linger the most. Missing Ben will resonate for a long time, especially given what he did to prepare himself to play in the series.\u201d Brown said he realized throughout the season that Philadelphia would experience spacing issues with all the pieces around center Joel Embiid, but he admitted that \u201cI didn\u2019t do a great job\u201d of coaching the team through those. \u201cYou have to take the team that you have and maximize it and get the most out of it, and I did not do that,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe came in and we talked about smash mouth, and bully ball, we\u2019re built for the playoffs, we\u2019re big. Really all those kinds of phrases equaled, man, we have a huge team. We have a big team.\u201d \u201cThe thing that I found the most challenging as the season played out, space became an enormous issue. And effectively you had a mismatch every possession down the court. And the fact is, that\u2019s Joel\u2019s world. That\u2019s Joel\u2019s domain. From a spatial issue, from a team sort of design, that was an area we needed to get done, and I don\u2019t believe I did that great of a job coaching that.\u201d Joel Embiid and Harris declined to place any blame on Brown for the team\u2019s struggles, and each pointed the finger at themselves. \u201cBefore we go that way, ownership has got to come from the individual at the end of the day,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to look myself in the mirror and be better for my team and be able to lead my team in a better way.\u201d Embiid scored a team-high 30 points in Game 4, but he finished the series at a team-worst minus-45. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue. We\u2019re good. We just didn\u2019t win,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cWe came out, we couldn\u2019t make shots the whole series. It\u2019s frustrating. I felt like everybody played hard. The shots just didn\u2019t fall. Then, at times, our defense was not good. We all tried. And we could\u2019ve done more. I could\u2019ve done more. There was a lot of stuff going on, and you just live and learn.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

DIFFICULTY: With Dorian Finney-Smith inbounding, Maxi Kleber set a screen on Kawhi Leonard at the top of the key, freeing Doncic into space on the deep on the left wing. Reggie Jackson picked up on the switch, and then Luka dribbled left, crossed right, dribbled right, crossed left and launched into the stepback. Buckets. GAME SITUATION: Marcus Morris Sr. had just tallied the latest of 12 lead changes with a corner 3 \u2014 off a no-look feed from Leonard, whose drive pulled three defenders under the basket. That shot, with 9.0 seconds remaining, left the Clippers up one, 133-132 with a foul to give. The Mavs burned six seconds looking for an opening before Jackson took the foul, setting up thee final inbounds, with 3.7 seconds on the clock. CELEBRATION: Luka pumped both fists, then pounded his chest and yelled while walking away. A swarm of teammates engulfed him and the mass of bodies throbbed its way over to the court sidewall, congratulations offered all around. \u201cNot only when the ball goes in, but when I see the whole team turning toward me, that was something special,\u201d Doncic said . \u201cOne of the best feelings I\u2019ve ever had as a player.\u201d GRADE: The Mavericks, trailing 2-1 in the series, were without Kristaps Porzingis (knee soreness) and dependent on Doncic \u2014 who had sprained an ankle in Game 3, leaving early and his Sunday status in some doubt. After 45 minutes of triple-double dominance, the 21-year-old Doncic added to his budding NBA legend with an almost unbelievably clutch capper to a standout playoff performance against one of the league\u2019s top title contenders.

Sometimes, it\u2019s a game of attrition. In Game 3 of their first round series with the Portland Trail Blazers, the Los Angeles Lakers simply outlasted their opponent, outscoring the Blazers 63-51 in the second half to take a 2-1 series lead with a 116-108 victory on Saturday. The Blazers have expended a ton of energy just to get here. They played eight critical seeding games plus a play-in game. Through Game 1 of this series, all 10 of their games in Orlando had been within five points in the last five minutes, and Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum had averaged 42.1 and 41.3 minutes per game, respectively. \u201cOur guys have held up really well, physically and mentally,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said before Game 3. \u201cI think NBA players in general are very resilient and generally come back ready to play the next game.\u201d After getting blown out in Game 2 on Thursday, the Blazers came back ready to play, for sure. Lillard and McCollum combined for 39 points on 14-for-25 shooting in the first half, pushing Portland to a four-point lead. They often avoided the pick-and-roll defense that smothered them in Game 2 by rejecting screens and going away from the extra defender . But the Blazers couldn\u2019t get any stops in the third quarter, when the Lakers scored 40 points on 25 possessions. And with his team in a seven-point hole, Blazers coach Terry Stotts played Lillard (who played all of the third quarter), McCollum, Carmelo Anthony and Jusuf Nurkic the entire fourth . \u201cI didn\u2019t like doing that,\u201d Stotts said, \u201cbut we had a bad stretch at the end of the third and I just felt like we needed to ride those guys as long as we could. I don\u2019t know if the fatigue had anything to do with it or not.\u201d It\u2019s hard to think it didn\u2019t. The Blazers scored just 12 points on their first 19 points of the final period. Lillard and McCollum combined to shoot 1-for-9 from outside the restricted area over the final 12 minutes, while Nurkic had one particular rough-looking attempt of a scoop shot. Anthony and LeBron James came into this league together, and there was a pretty good debate about which should have won Rookie of the Year. Seventeen years later, James is remains an indefatigable force, while Anthony can only give the Blazers a flurry of offense here and there. He put together four straight scores in the middle of the third quarter on Saturday and finished with 20 points, but needed 20 shots to get those 20 points and is now 6-for-21 (29%) from mid-range in the series. James, meanwhile, scored more points in Game 3 (38) than he did in Games 1 and 2 combined (33), shooting 11-for-18 from the floor and 12-for-17 from the free throw line, adding 12 rebounds and eight assists. At the age of 35, he\u2019s still going strong, and the win on Saturday gave him 158 playoff wins for his career, moving him into second place all-time. This was not a one-man show, however. +6 \u2014 Lakers\u2019 point differential with James off the floor. In the regular season, the Lakers were 10.4 points per 100 possessions better with James on the floor (+8.5) than they were with him on the floor (-1.9). That was the eighth biggest differential in the league , and the off-floor number was worse ( -3.0 per 100) in the minutes when Anthony Davis was on the floor without James. As great of a season that Davis had, he wasn\u2019t able to keep the team afloat without his fellow All-Star. But the Lakers had good (pre-garbage-time) minutes without James in Game 2 on Thursday and a pair of sequences in Game 3 came when he rested in the second half. Both sequences featured a lot of pick-and-roll with Davis setting screens for Alex Caruso. At a timeout with 4:35 left in the third and with the Lakers up by just one, Caruso and Kyle Kuzma checked in for James and JaVale McGee, moving Davis to center. And on the next three possessions, the Lakers looked to give Davis space to operate against Hassan Whiteside. Each time down the floor, the other three Lakers cleared to the right side of the floor as Caruso and Davis ran pick-and-roll:  Here\u2019s the video: Play 1. On the first possession out of the timeout, Anfernee Simons trails Caruso around the screen and nobody stops the ball. Whiteside retreats to Davis and, after initially stepping into Caruso\u2019s path, Anthony does a heck of a matador impression, allowing Caruso to get all the way to the basket. Play 2. On the next possession, Caruso goes the other way, puts Simons on his hip, and tries to get to the baseline with a \u201cSmitty.\u201d Simons is able to stay in front, but Caruso kicks the ball back to Davis and follows with a screen on Whiteside. Davis gets around Simons and gets an and-one dunk on the baseline. Play 3. Three possessions later, the Lakers clear the left side of the floor again. Caruso and Davis run the pick-and-roll going to the right, Lillard goes under the screen (instead of over like Simons in Play 1), and Caruso steps back for a 3-pointer. Three Caruso-Davis pick-and-rolls. Eight points, part of 12-2 run that turned a one-point game into an 11-point cushion late in the third quarter. One aside: That lineup for the first two possessions above \u2013 Caruso and Davis with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green and Kuzma as floor spacers \u2013 seems like a pretty good offensive look for the minutes that James rests. But it only played 11 total minutes in the regular season, wasn\u2019t used in Games 1 or 2, and only played 1:56 together in the first and third quarters on Friday. In both halves, Markieff Morris checked in for Green not long after the Caruso and Kuzma subs. Caruso and Davis weren\u2019t done. James checked out again during a timeout with 7:15 to go in the fourth quarter, and the AC and AD combo went right back to work. After McCollum hit a jumper to cut the Lakers\u2019 lead to five, they went back to the pick-and-roll (though with Dwight Howard on the floor and Davis at the four) for three straight possessions: Play 1. Lillard goes under the screen and Whiteside is able to protect the rim because Howard is in the \u201cdunker\u201d spot. But Nurkic is still drawn to Caruso, who gets the ball back to Davis at the right elbow. Nurkic is a little slow with his contest, preferring to not get beat off the dribble. Play 2. On the next possession, Caruso initially tries to get Davis a drive by handing him the ball and getting in Nurkic\u2019s way. But Nurkic is able to get back in front and the Lakers\u2019 tandem goes back to the pick-and-pop. Lillard goes under again, but Nurkic switches onto Caruso and Lillard isn\u2019t able to recover in time as Davis finds space above the left elbow. Play 3. On the next possession, with Davis in a groove, Caruso sees Nurkic\u2019s positioning and dribbles right at the big man to engage him, and passes back to Davis, wide open again above the right elbow. Play 4. A few minutes later, James is on the floor, but the Lakers draw up another Caruso-Davis pick-and-roll out of a timeout. This time the Blazers switch it so they can stay attached to Davis. But that gets him isolated against the 6-foot-5 Gary Trent Jr. Anthony shades over to help on the mismatch, and when Davis kicks the ball to James on the right wing, he\u2019s able to attack the seam and draw a foul. Those three scores with James off the floor pushed the lead from five to nine with 5:30 to go. The Blazers never got back to within two possessions. And the Davis jumpers may have value well beyond Game 3. Over the first 10 games in Orlando, Davis had shot 23-for-94 (24%) from outside the restricted area. On Friday, James shot 4-for-8 from 3-point range and Davis was 6-for-7 from mid-range. A little regression toward the mean may also result in a better offensive rhythm for an offense that had been struggling and a better chance for the Lakers to beat teams stronger than the one they\u2019re currently facing. After a first half in which James scored 22 points and Davis scored just six (1-for-3 from the field, 4-for-9 from the line), the big man promised to carry some of the load over the final 24 minutes. \u201cI told \u2018Bron at half I got to take some of the pressure off of him,\u201d Davis said afterward. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to just carry the team the entire time.\u201d After that six-point first half, Davis had 23 points (on 10-for-15 shooting), six rebounds and five assists after halftime. And key was that two-man game with Caruso when James was off the floor. The Lakers were hoping to get Rajon Rondo back from a thumb injury on Saturday. But the 14-year vet was a late scratch after suffering back spasms as he warmed up. The Lakers need more playmaking beyond James, whether it comes from Rondo or Caruso. \u201cThe No. 1 thing it does is it allows LeBron to be off the ball some,\u201d Vogel said, \u201cwhich is important to our offense and sustaining his freshness throughout 48 minutes. And Anthony, as a big guy, as much as he can score in a variety of ways, all bigs are dependent on some level on guards to be able to set them up. Rajon has been sort of that guy in the second unit throughout the year. We\u2019ve missed him. Hopefully we get him back soon. But in the meantime tonight, Alex did a great job setting up AD.\u201d No rest for the weary. There are no two-day breaks in these playoffs and Game 4 is Monday ( 9 p.m. ET, TNT ). So the Blazers will have to summon up the energy to get back at it. Stotts said that he\u2019ll likely stick with the starting lineup that he went to for Game 3, playing Nurkic and Whiteside together on the frontline. The big men were a minus-2 in 15.4 minutes together on Saturday. The Blazers have been outscored by 1.2 points per 100 possessions in their 41 minutes together in the series, but that\u2019s much, much better than the differential with one on the floor without the other ( -13.1 per 100 in 56 minutes with Nurkic on the floor without Whiteside, -14.9 per 100 in 33 minutes with Whiteside on the floor without Nurkic). The Lakers will continue to try to take advantage and wear the Blazers down they way they know how. \u201cWe just want to run,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSince they\u2019ve been here, they\u2019ve been playing like Game 7s. So it\u2019s our job to keep putting the pressure on them and keep running at the bigs. That\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to do. Making some jumpers helps, too. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Powered by its three-guard lineup featuring Dennis Schroder (29 points), Chris Paul (26) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23), Oklahoma City bested Houston in overtime , 119-107, on Saturday for its first victory of the Western Conference playoffs. Throw in Danilo Gallinari\u2019s 20-point contribution, and Oklahoma City featured four players scoring 20 points or more for the first time since 1976 (as the Supersonics). The Thunder now trail Houston in the series, 2-1. \u201cWe made quick decisions,\u201d said Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan. \u201cI really felt like the first half of Game 2 we did that, and then I thought in the second half of Game 2 we got slowed down, we were holding it. We\u2019ve got advery, very cerebral, smart team. A lot of times, they really with their mind can try to manipulate the game. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got a team [like Houston] that\u2019s switching everything you\u2019re doing, sometimes, what you\u2019ve got to do is you\u2019ve got to be in good spacing and attacking, and just really trying to play a little bit faster and make quicker decisions. We\u2019ve got to play that way.\u201d The Thunder did it masterfully Saturday when the stakes were highest. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to figure out how to play against their defense,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cThey\u2019re the only team in the NBA that really plays like that. It\u2019s something that we have to get used to. But I think we\u2019ve figured it out and we\u2019re excited about going forward.\u201d Here are three takeaways: Entering the postseason, we mentioned Oklahoma City\u2019s propensity to perform in clutch situations, as Schroder, Paul, Gilgeous-Alexander and Gallinari came into the playoffs ranked among the top of the league in regular-season games played during clutch time \u2014 any game separated by five points or fewer in the last five minutes. The Thunder finished the regular season with a league-best record of 30-14 in clutch time, and that muscle memory definitely came in handy against the Rockets, helping OKC to capture a Game 3 win for the sixth consecutive instance after trailing 0-2 in a playoff series. With 59.7 seconds left to play, OKC trailed by 5 points after P.J. Tucker\u2019s 23-footer made the score 102-97. But 45.4 ticks later, after layups from Paul and Steven Adams, the veteran point guard then launched a nifty pass to a wide-open Gilgeous-Alexander, who nailed a 3-pointer to put the Thunder up 104-103. \u201cWe talked about it in the huddle,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe wanted to try to go at a matchup. So, once I got that matchup, I knew that help was going to have to come over from somewhere. The pass was easy. Shai had the hard part of knocking down the shot. That was a big shot for us.\u201d From there, James Harden, who scored a game-high 38 points, picked up his sixth foul 53 seconds into the OT period, as Oklahoma City shot off to a 12-0 run. Houston\u2019s first basket of OT didn\u2019t come until 56.1 seconds remained. \u201cWe know that if we play the right way, play to our identity, anything is possible,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cWe\u2019ve proven so, so many times this year that that\u2019s just our mentality now, and it\u2019s part of our nature.\u201d Paul knocked down two 3-pointers in OT, as the Thunder connected on 4-of-9 field goals in the extra frame. Houston shot 1-for-9 from the floor in OT and hit just 15-of-50 from deep for the game. \u201cWe definitely let one get away,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI think throughout the course of the game, we just made too many mental mistakes and gave them opportunities to score. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni chalked up Paul\u2019s late-game heroics as \u201cwhat he\u2019s been doing for the last probably 15 years. He just is a great clutch player, and really thinks the game. But having said that, we had the game [with] 24 seconds [left] and a one-point lead. They executed, we didn\u2019t. Some things just messed up a little bit. I just told them you don\u2019t get too high, you don\u2019t get too low. It\u2019s one game. We played a lot of minutes, but they played a lot of minutes also. So, it\u2019s gonna be just whoever has the will to come out the next game and get a win.\u201d Harden and the Rockets are quickly discovering as much. Sure, Harden produced his 21st career playoff game with 35-plus points. But they didn\u2019t come easy with Dort defending him. Dort sat out of Game 1 due to a right knee sprain, but in 25 minutes of defending Harden in Game 2, he limited the 2018 MVP and three-time scoring champion to 21 points on 5-of-16 shooting. By the time Dort blocked Harden\u2019s driving layup to start overtime, he had already held the Rockets guard to 3-of-14 shooting in Game 3. \u201cLu is trying to guard arguably one of the best offensive players to ever play the game,\u201d Paul said. \u201cJames is that tough to defend with the stepbacks, the drives, the ability to get to the free-throw line. So, what we\u2019re trying to do, too, is trying to make him defend. The way that they play is they seek out matchups, and they try to go at you. So, we want to try to make sure that we keep him working on the other end, too.\u201d That tactic certainly worked, and ironically, Harden committed his sixth foul trying to defend Dort. It marked the first time Harden fouled out of a postseason game since May 2017. \u201cI thought Lu\u2019s effort on James, on Eric Gordon, was really, really great,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cHe put it all into it.\u201d  Although Houston seemed to breeze through the first two games of this series without Westbrook in the lineup, it\u2019s clear the Rockets could have used his athleticism on both ends of the floor in this one. Donovan and Paul said that OKC has been able to counteract Houston\u2019s ability to switch everything on defense by playing downhill and making quick decisions. That task becomes more difficult for OKC with Westbrook on the floor. Westbrook has missed five consecutive games since the NBA restart due to a strained right quadriceps muscle. D\u2019Antoni was asked after the game whether Westbrook might be ready to return on Monday for Game 4. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to test it,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe\u2019s working every day, getting a little bit better. So, we\u2019ll see. Today, I have no clue. His status didn\u2019t change from the start of the game, where he didn\u2019t play, to the end of the game. So, we\u2019ll see in a day or two.\u201d D\u2019Antoni said before the game that Westbrook had participated in some limited work with the team. The Rockets finished the regular season with a record of 10-8 without Westbrook in the lineup. Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

And after handling the Magic on Saturday, 121-107 , to take a 2-1 lead in the series, the Bucks will rise and hope to shine again early Monday, facing Orlando in Game 4 in yet another matinee (1:30 ET, NBA TV). It\u2019s not the ideal schedule, given how players and coaches typically go through their days and peak when the sun goes down. Bio-rhythms, sleep patterns, muscle memory and all that, right? Even when TV demands some daytime weekend games every postseason, those are kept to a minimum. Not possible, though, with the league\u2019s restart and compressed playoff schedule. In the seeding games, the Bucks \u2014 based on Milwaukee time \u2014 started games at 5:30 p.m., 12:30 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. So far against the Magic, it\u2019s been 12:30 p.m., 5 p.m, noon Saturday and 12:30 p.m. again Monday. Put to a vote, you\u2019d probably find more NBA players preferring a midnight start to a noon start. But with four games daily in the first round, all televised with minimal conflict, somebody has to go first. That leaves the very real challenge of shifting all of their body clocks. Imagine if your work schedule bounced from first shift to graveyard shift, then to second, back to first, day-by-day. You might be a little off your game too. OK, now imagine if you had Giannis Antetokounmpo Euro-stepping his way into your office or plant or store, and then hollering and mean-mugging every so often to celebrate a sale or just make sure you\u2019re awake. Might help the energy level, right? That\u2019s what the Bucks\u2019 MVP did in this one. \u201cI was just trying to play hard. Obviously it was the early game today,\u201d Antetokounmpo said after scoring 35 points with 11 rebounds and seven assists, while missing only two of his 14 shots. \u201cUsually we\u2019re not as focused. When the game starts, we\u2019re a little bit lazy. \u201cSo I was just trying to set the tone, play hard, guard my guy, take up the individual challenge, try to be active. Just be all over the place. I knew this game was big for us. We had to do what we did in Game 2.\u201d The Bucks, caught trying to cruise through the series opener Tuesday, pounced on Orlando with defensive intensity and a more aggressive offense two days later. They did it again in Game 3, using run after run after run to lead by 34 midway through the third quarter. Managing that lead got a little tricky \u2014 the Magic got as close as 12 early in the fourth \u2014 but Milwaukee asserted itself to breathe again, no further hiccups. Orlando had some excuses, losing starting James Ennis at 5:39 of the second quarter when he and Bucks reserve Marvin Williams were ejected for a shoving match. Magic coach Steve Clifford already was working without forwards Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac. To his credit, Clifford didn\u2019t feel his team played hard enough or stayed close enough to have the right to complain about injuries or ejections. Besides, having Antetokounmpo \u2014 whom Clifford called \u201cthe ultra competitor\u201d \u2014 was the bigger deal regardless. \u201cAll of us feed off of Giannis and his leadership and his energy and his competitiveness,\u201d said Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cWhen he\u2019s showing it and sharing it with all of us, and touching all of us, it\u2019s great. He\u2019s our leader and we needed it. \u201cThe 1 o\u2019clock starts, you\u2019ve got to find a way to dig deep and Giannis certainly did that, our group did that. We\u2019re gonna need it again \u2014 I think we have another early start for Game 4.\u201d Antetokounmpo, at this stage of the playoffs anyway, has been winning the battle of adjustments between his game and Orlando\u2019s defense. He joined some legends Saturday, becoming only the fourth player in league history to average at least 35 points, 10 rebounds and five assists through the first three games of a series. (Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kevin Garnett are the others.) \u201cPlaying the same team for the third time, you kind of know where shots are going to come from,\u201d Antetokounmpo said in his Zoom postgame session. \u201cYou know how they\u2019re going to guard you. You know what to do when you roll, you know what to do when you post up, you know what to do when you come down the floor. You know where the help is coming from. \u201cYou get, not more comfortable, you just get more aware out there.\u201d Antetokounmpo logged some second-half minutes against Magic center Nikola Vucevic, surrounded by deep threats George Hill, Kyle Korver, Pat Connaughton and Donte DiVincenzo. The move was kind of a push on the scoreboard but it has the potential to either exploit a mismatch with Orlando\u2019s best player or have Vucevic sit down. Antetokounmpo\u2019s energy and demeanor helped to wake up sidekick Khris Middleton, who had struggled in Games 1 and 2 averaging 8.0 points on 25 percent shooting. When the Bucks intentionally looked for Middleton early to try to get him going, the low-key wing responded with a pair of jump shots shortly before the Ennis-Williams skirmish. His buddy from Greece screamed and punched the air after the second as if there\u2019d been a buzzer beater. That\u2019s the sort of stuff teammates notice, Middleton said, talking about the confidence it instills. \u201cIt felt good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re used to [Giannis] doing. With thousands of fans behind him, cheering him on. We\u2019re finding that we have to bring the energy ourselves because we don\u2019t have those fans.\u201d Virtual fans are working fine for Milwaukee now, as long as Antetokounmpo remains his three-dimensional self.

His words proved prophetic Saturday. The Heat blitzed their way to an early 20-point lead, only to have to grind their way through the final, tense moments to secure a 124-115 win and a 3-0 series lead . While the Pacers played frantically down the stretch, no doubt a product of expending the energy needed to come back from a large deficit, the Heat stayed cool. They didn\u2019t rattle under the pressure, even with Pacers closing within a basket twice in the final four minutes. For every punch the Pacers landed after halftime, the Heat fired back with a counter, or two. They salted the game away with clutch defensive stops and polished shooting from the free throw line, shooting 43-for-52 with Butler going 17-for-20. \u201cTo tell you the truth, we talked about how we were going to have to get one out the mud,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make shots every night. But I think we did a great job on the defensive end and getting to the foul line. You step up, you make them and you get a little confidence. So you get some stops and get to the foul line. It wasn\u2019t a part of the game plan but it helped us win tonight.\u201d Clinging to a 114-112 lead with 1:40 to play, the Heat closed the game on a 10-3 run. Butler was at the center of it all, as expected, as was his All-Star counterpart Bam Adebayo and veteran point guard Goran Dragic. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra went with veterans \u2014 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala and Jae Crowder, rotating on an offense-defense substitution pattern with rookie sharpshooter Tyler Herro \u2014 as his closing lineup. Spoelstra\u2019s expression never changed down the stretch, not for anything his team did or did not do, and mostly because he wasn\u2019t shocked to see the Pacers rally after the Heat lit them up for 74 points in the first half. \u201cYou have to be objective about this,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThis is a very good team over there. And we made a bunch of 3s in the first half, offense looked good. But they still scored 56. They have capable guys that break you down off the dribble and shoot the 3, which makes it tough. So you have to expect it to be a full 48-minute game, if not longer. And you\u2019ve got to compete all the way through. And our guys had the mindset, even though Indiana made a big run in that second half, we were expecting it to be tough.\u201d The Heat proved to be up to the task in every way. They had four players \u2014 Butler, Adebayo, Dragic and Herro \u2014 score 20 or more points for only the second time in Heat playoff history, the first time coming in the 2012 Finals. And when they needed it most, Butler and Adebayo in particular, came up with the rebounds, blocks and critical plays to put the Pacers away. As Butler mentioned after Adebayo\u2019s monster Game 2 effort, one that wasn\u2019t necessarily reflected in the stat sheet, it\u2019s the impact on winning that often makes the biggest difference. Adebayo had both this time, finishing with 22 points and 5 assists. But it was the 11 rebounds, none bigger than his final three (one offensive and two defensive), that could wind up being colossal plays in this series if the Heat close it out Monday night. \u201cHis biggest moments came down the stretch on both ends,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThose rebounds were big time. We needed those extra relief opportunities because they jammed us up a couple times and forced us into a couple turnovers. Those relief points and those free throws, were key. And obviously, those rebounds defensively were Udonis[Haslem]-esque.\u201d There\u2019s a reasons Adebayo looks so comfortable in those high-pressure moments in his first full season as a starter. Butler said all of the youngsters on this Heat roster came with self-starter kits and the requisite chips on their shoulders required to compete at this level. And they are past the point of needing to prove anything to anyone. \u201cHell, Bam don\u2019t need any more confidence,\u201d Butler said. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s one of the top players in this league, And he\u2019s only going to continue to get better because he works and he cares and he studies the game. I always tell y\u2019all, and I mean it, he\u2019s the heart and soul behind this team, he\u2019s the one that makes us go. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference whenever he\u2019s on the floor and off the floor, on both ends of it. So he don\u2019t have anything to prove to anybody. He knows who he is. He\u2019s a lot like myself and everybody else in that locker room and I\u2019d say he doesn\u2019t care what anybody thinks, he\u2019s going go out there and do his job to help us win.\u201d Adebayo\u2019s battling one of the league\u2019s top shot blockers in Pacers center Myles Turner, giving up a couple of inches and years of experience, even though he\u2019s dictating the action on both ends of the floor. \u201cI feel like the player that I am, it\u2019s hard to take me out,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because I do a lot of things so well, not trying to pat myself on the back or anything. But because I screen well, I get guys open and it doesn\u2019t always have to be about scoring with me. I mean, in Game 2 I had seven points but everybody said I had the biggest impact on the game, so it\u2019s little stuff like that. \u201cI came into the league as a defender and an energy guy, so when my shot is not falling and my offense is not going, I just bank on my defense and my effort.\u201d When the Pacers cranked up the intensity on both ends after halftime, the Heat had to lean on their defense and effort. They had to lean on the entire group, youngsters and old heads alike. Now they\u2019re sitting on a clear path to the next round, knowing well that teams that go up 3-0 in a best-of-seven series are 136-0 all-time. \u201cOur approach is the same,\u201d Butler said.\u201dWe don\u2019t worry about any other team, or what teams have done in the past. We\u2019re who we are. We can\u2019t worry about what the stats say. We don\u2019t even run like that here. We know we\u2019ve got one more to win and we know we\u2019re capable of it. But it\u2019s definitely going to be a dogfight next game.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

There is a flip side, however: That city is infamously known for eating its own whenever the fans sense doom caused by mistakes and dashed hopes, and so maybe it\u2019s better the Sixers are here in a safe space. You can imagine: The sound of disenchantment that only Philly can muster would surely have banged in the eardrums of the Sixers in the event of a first-round sweep by the longtime rival Celtics. The failure would be partly because the Sixers lost Ben Simmons , but maybe because their front office lost as well. Whenever the playoff end comes for the Sixers, down 0-3 to Boston, the next crash is expected to be coach Brett Brown hitting the door, followed by an offseason of reflection for a club that might cringe at what it\u2019ll see in the rear view. In a nutshell: Much of Sam Hinkie\u2019s work is dying due to the sins of decision-makers who followed. You remember Hinkie \u2014 the GM who might as well have trademarked \u201cTrust The Process\u201d, who incredibly sacrificed four seasons just for the chance of a better day? The Sixers tanked to set themselves up as championship contenders; why does it now appear they failed to max out those ample chances? Three summers ago, the Sixers had a fresh young pair of franchise building blocks in Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, held the No. 1 overall pick and carried a few solid role players, with millions under the salary cap. They were flush with assets and ready to justify Hinkie\u2019s bold experiment. But now, they\u2019ve used that flexibility, are capped out for the next three years, are not the heavyweight of the East \u2014 let alone the NBA, and they\u2019re in danger of getting swept. In the first round. The Sixers canceled practice Saturday, a day after Brown brushed aside questions about his job security following a dispiriting Game 3 loss to the Celtics. \u201cI understand the circumstance,\u201d he said. \u201c My job is to focus on what I really can do. My players deserve that. I \u2019 ve been in the city seven years, and tonight \u2019 s loss is what \u2019 s most on my mind. My effort truly is to try to find a way to win, keep the series alive, and do my job for my players. I \u2019 m not rolling over.\u201d Meanwhile, Embiid\u2019s voice was barely above a whisper and his eyes weary. Clearly worn down in the second half for the second straight game, he made only one basket in the final two quarters. \u201cI don \u2019 t want to be swept. I don \u2019 t want that on my resume.\u201d What happened to all that Philly momentum? Embiid became the beast the Sixers envisioned, the most dominant Philly big man since Moses Malone helped win that city\u2019s last title, and Simmons should resume being a freakish 6-foot-10 point guard once his knee heals. That\u2019s the good. Here\u2019s the not so good: The Sixers have little to show for the No. 1 overall pick in 2017 or their Jimmy Butler acquisition, and they\u2019re paying Tobias Harris and Al Horford almost $300 million combined and neither can or will justify that price. This is the result of the work done by former GM Bryan Colangelo, and Brown when he briefly held both jobs, and lately Elton Brand, who was just two years removed from his playing career when given the front office keys. Sometimes the hindsight game is unfair; every GM has mistakes on his resume. In this case, the mistakes came in a rush and in short time, and they might prevent the Sixers from making a serious title run. It\u2019s not easy to whiff on the first overall pick. Colangelo wanted to pair a combo guard next to Simmons and saw Fultz as the solution. But combo guards are plentiful, scoring swingmen are not. Rather than put a premium on Jayson Tatum, Colangelo went for Fultz, and traded up for him \u2014 sending Tatum to rival Boston in the deal. Fultz was hampered by a nerve condition that wrecked his shooting motion, and rather than develop him, the Sixers shipped him to Orlando last year for essentially Oklahoma City\u2019s first-rounder next month. Fultz has since recovered and begun to establish what seems to be a long-term role with the Magic. Meanwhile, Tatum is an emerging superstar, one who tortures the Sixers; he scored 65 points the first two games of this series. It should be mentioned that the previous year, the Sixers had two additional first-rounders besides the Simmons pick thanks to Hinkie. Each time, they passed on Pascal Siakam, last season\u2019s Most Improved Player and a future cornerstone in Toronto. After Colangelo resigned amid social media scandal, Brown served as the interim GM and boldly declared the Sixers were going \u201cstar hunting\u201d with their assets and Embiid and Simmons as selling points to free agents. \u201cThe whole notion of star hunting, star chasing, star development is at the forefront of everything we do \u2026 The timeline is now.\u201d Well, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant and Paul George all passed on Philly. And the trade the Sixers swung with some of those assets seems dubious right now. Harris is a scorer, though not a high-volume one, and that\u2019s his only major talent. In his first big splash as GM, Brand traded a young guard in Landry Shamet plus a 2020 protected first and the Heat\u2019s unprotected 2021 first for Harris last spring. That\u2019s a haul in itself, but not the troubling part of the deal. One of the league\u2019s front office maxims is to be careful trading for a pending unrestricted free agent, because when you surrender lots of assets for him, you lose all negotiating leverage. You must overpay to justify the trade \u2014 if he walks, like Butler did for Miami, you have nothing to show for the deal \u2014 and that\u2019s what happened with Harris. He declined the Clippers\u2019 extension offer of $80 million before the trade, and then four months later signed with Philly for $180 million, a Hall of Fame business decision for him and a cap-clogging one for the Sixers. Harris is shooting 33 percent against the Celtics, still hasn\u2019t made a 3-pointer, and is unable to match the gusto of Tatum or Jaylen Brown from Boston. Brand then thought getting Horford to opt out of his final season with the Celtics last summer was genius, because not only would the Sixers get a power forward to place next to Embiid, they\u2019d also weaken one of their biggest competitors in the East. Yet the Sixers weren\u2019t in a position of strength during the negotiation, and Horford wrangled four years and $109 million, steep for a player past his prime. Compounding the situation: Horford and Embiid have poor chemistry, and Horford is a ghost in this playoff series, averaging 5.3 points and 6.3 rebounds in 30.7 minutes. In the eventual process, Philly didn\u2019t keep Jimmy Butler or JJ Redick. Meanwhile, Harris has perhaps peaked as a player (he\u2019s third in the NBA after Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson for most remaining guaranteed money left on a contract) while Horford doesn\u2019t seem to be a good fit. They\u2019ll be tough to trade unless the Sixers sweeten any deal with assets. Embiid and Simmons will prevent them from sinking in the East, but the club better hope neither star becomes disgruntled by the team\u2019s lack of progress. If that were to happen, the process might need its own .. process. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

This is the first NBA Coach of the Year Award for Nurse, who is in his second season as an NBA head coach. Nurse, the 2010-11 NBA G League Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year with the Iowa Energy (now the Iowa Wolves), becomes the first coach to be selected as Coach of the Year in both the NBA and the NBA G League. Nurse received 90 first-place votes from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters and earned 470 total points. Two-time NBA Coach of the Year Mike Budenholzer of the Milwaukee Bucks (147 points; five first-place votes) and Billy Donovan of the Oklahoma City Thunder (134 points; four first-place votes) finished in second and third place, respectively. Coaches were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30- Aug. 14 as part of the season restart, did not count toward voting for the NBA Coach of the Year Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards.  In games played through March 11, Nurse led the Raptors (46-18, .719) to the second-best record in the Eastern Conference and the third-best record in the NBA even though the team\u2019s top five players in scoring average missed at least 11 games each. During this period, Toronto ranked second in the league in defensive rating despite a 28-game absence for starting center and 2012-13 Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marc Gasol and the departure of two-time Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard in the 2019 offseason. Nurse was named the NBA Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for games played in October\/November (14-4) and January (12-3). He guided the Raptors to a franchise-record 15-game winning streak Jan. 15 \u2013 Feb. 10. Under Nurse, 2018-19 Kia NBA Most Improved Player Pascal Siakam was named an NBA All-Star for the first time and Kyle Lowry earned his sixth consecutive All-Star selection. Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell flourished with larger roles, while undrafted rookie Terence Davis II emerged as a contributor. Nurse was named the Raptors\u2019 head coach in June 2018 after spending five seasons as an assistant coach with Toronto. As a first-year NBA head coach last season, Nurse guided the Raptors to their first NBA championship. He is the only coach to win championships in both the NBA and the NBA G League, having won titles with the Energy (2010-11) and the Rio Grande Valley Vipers (2012-13) in the NBA G League.  Nurse receives the Red Auerbach Trophy as NBA Coach of the Year, joining Sam Mitchell (2006-07) and Dwane Casey (2017-18) as winners with the Raptors. Auerbach, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, coached the Boston Celtics to nine NBA championships, including eight in a row from 1959-66.

(Un)lucky break: No one ever wants to see a peer go down with injury, but it was because an All-State guard broke his rib at the Iowa All-Star game that Nurse got a chance to show what he could do. Moving from backup to starter in the game, his performance (\u201c27 points or something,\u201d he said ) immediately got him an offer to play at Northern Iowa. Sharp-shooter: Nurse remains the top career 3-point shooter ever to don a Northern Iowa jersey. The former Panthers point guard shot 170-for-363 (46.8%) from downtown over his four years with the team. Player-coach: Nurse knew he wanted to keep his basketball career going by either playing or coaching. He wound up doing both for the Derby Rams of the British Basketball League \u2014 all at age 23. O\u2019er the pond and back again: Nurse made several crossings between continents to hone his coaching chops. His resume includes stops in Iowa, South Dakota, England, Belgium and Oklahoma. D League Determination: Intent on making his NBA breakthrough, Nurse relentlessly contacted league personnel until coming across a brand-new stadium in Des Moines, Iowa. More phone calls finally resulted in the league opening an expansion team: the Iowa Energy. Their first head coach: Nick Nurse. Building a rep: Nurse didn\u2019t hastily use his D-League (now the G League) time as a stepping stone to the NBA. He excelled, winning the 2011 Coach of the Year award and D-League championships with two different teams. Raptors come calling: All that D-League success led to Toronto hiring Nurse to its coaching staff in 2013. His laboratory was the film room, where he spent inordinate hours that eventually paid off; Nurse received much credit for the Raptors\u2019 improving offense, which produced 59 regular-season wins in 2017-18. He\u2019s the guy: Toronto\u2019s search for a new head coach in the summer of 2018 was thorough. Bigger names with past NBA head coaching experience were reported. Turns out the guy the Raptors needed was already there. When he was told he had the job, Nurse told only his wife. Someone, however, apparently leaked the news. \u201cI got to the office 15 minutes later \u2014 probably rode my bike over \u2014 and I had 259 text messages.\u201d"},{"id":26277,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/billy-donovan-10-things-know","date":"2020-08-22","title":"Billy Donovan: 10 things to know","content":" Thunder coach Billy Donovan opened his NBA run with a trip to the conference finals in 2016, when Oklahoma City nearly knocked off the defending champion Golden State Warriors. Three straight first-round exits followed. His roster has a different look this season, led by Chris Paul, Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and Danilo Gallinari. Seeded fourth, they earned a matchup against the Houston Rockets and Russell Westbrook, whom they worked with to find a new home last summer once Paul George declared his intent to head to the LA Clippers. Upsetting one of this era\u2019s top contenders would provide a cap to the comeback season and provide further evidence that Donovan\u2019s place among the coaching elite has been well earned. The journey started on Long Island. Son of Bill Donovan Sr. and Joan Donovan, the younger Billy came from strong basketball stock \u2013 his father is a member of the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame (2000). The elder Donovan became the school\u2019s fourth 1,000-point scorer after serving as a three-year starter (1958-62) and senior captain, known for his long-range shooting. Later returning to his native Long Island, Bill Donovan raised his family in Nassau County\u2019s Rockville Center. Followed in the footsteps \u2026 at first. Billy played at St. Agnes High School, just like his father , but opted to play college ball at Providence for Joseph Mullaney. A sharpshooting 6-foot-2 guard known as \u201cBilly the Kid\u201d, he helped lead the Friars from 8th in the Big East as a Freshman (1983-84) to the NCAA Tournament men\u2019s basketball Final Four as a No. 6 seed during his senior year (1986-87), aided by a coaching change to Rick Pitino midway through. A failed transfer request resulted in Pitino challenging Donovan to improve his conditioning and Donovan averaged 20.6 ppg (43.5 FG%) as a senior, earning recognition on the All-Big East First Team. On to the NBA, briefly. Donovan was drafted by the Utah Jazz in the third round (No. 68 overall), but was waived just before the season started. Fortuitously, Pitino was now head coach of the New York Knicks, and signed Donovan a month later. The reunion lasted through March, with Donovan averaging 2.4 points and 2.0 assists in 8.3 minutes across 44 games. No suit on the street, so he hit the hardwood. Donovan briefly worked on Wall Street before turning again to Pitino, who took him on as a graduate assistant at Kentucky. That soon flipped into an assistant coaching position. And just a few years later, he became the youngest head coach in Division-I at 28 years old, taking the gig at Marshall University. A quick turnaround and a first prospect. Racking up a 35-20 record and a regular-season Southern Conference championship, Donovan quickly positioned the Thundering Herd \u2013 and himself \u2013 for future success. He coached Jason Williams (\u201cWhite Chocolate\u201d) and when Florida tapped Donovan for an SEC return, the flashy point guard followed along, later becoming the No. 7 overall pick in the NBA Draft. The build toward dynasty begins. Taking over a team that had finished 12-16 (5th, SEC East), Donovan ground out the first two middling seasons before a breakthrough third in 1998-99, when the Gators went 22-9 and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen as a No. 6 seed. That team was led by a pair of freshmen who went on to impressively long \u2013 and overlapping \u2013 championship-level NBA careers: Heat lifer Udonis Haslem and 3-point bomber Mike Miller. They reached the championship game a year later, only to be defeated by Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson\u2019s Michigan State. That notably made Donovan one of a select few to play and coach in a Final Four. A lull, and then that back-to-back. The next four seasons all stalled out inside the Second Round of the NCAA Tournament, but in 2005-06 Donovan\u2019s sophomore class \u2013 an impressive collection of future NBA talent \u2013 marauded through the opposition as a No. 3 seed, winning the title over a UCLA team with six future NBA players. Yes, Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Corey Brewer and Taurean Green not only came to party, they all came back, for a 35-5 encore that again ended victorious, this time over Ohio State, which rolled out future No. 1 overall pick Greg Oden, Mike Conley and Daequan Cook. Donovan pump-fakes Orlando. Coming off the title, Donovan agreed to take over the NBA\u2019s Orlando Magic, but didn\u2019t make it through a week before realizing he wanted to return to Florida. He did, stayed nine more seasons, made another Final Four (2014) and joined Bobby Knight as the only coaches to win 500 games before they turned 50. The Magic, meanwhile, turned to Stan Van Gundy and ripped off five straight playoff appearances, peaking with a loss to the Lakers during the 2009 NBA Finals. Hearing Thunder rumble. With Scott Brooks out in Oklahoma City, Donovan was offered the chance to push the Thunder toward that elusive championship out West in 2015. He accepted, taking over a squad that included Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka, quickly acclimating to the NBA challenge and leading that team to 55 wins and a seven-game conference final challenge that stands as perhaps the toughest test Golden State received during its run of five straight Finals appearances. Turmoil, and then one more turnaround. Kevin Durant left for the Warriors. Russ was unleashed as an MVP-winning, triple-double machine. Paul George arrived, and then was waved off the stage. After three straight first-round exits, it seemed Donovan\u2019s success had stalled. But when George\u2019s exit ended with Russ in Houston as well as a boatload of picks, Paul, a potential future star (Gilgeous-Alexander) and several depth pieces headed to OKC, Donovan went to work. An invested CP3 and a rebooted offense lifted the Thunder to the top half of the Western Conference, and reminded everyone why Donovan was brought in from a comfortable college situation. Doubting any future NBA success comes at your own risk."},{"id":26283,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-reclaim-dominant-position-control-series","date":"2020-08-22","title":"Clippers reclaim dominant position, control series vs. Mavericks","content":" Confidence will only take you so far in the NBA playoffs. Sooner or later the team with better talent, more experience and the clear advantages will assume the dominant position. It was late Friday night in Orlando, in the second quarter of Game 3 against of this Western Conference playoff series, when that moment arrived for Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers. They finally located that sweet spot against the Dallas Mavericks, who played the final 9 minutes of the game without the MVP candidate Luka Doncic, who sprained his left ankle. After playing on their heels during much of the first two games in this series, the Clippers asserted themselves early and often in a 130-122 win to take a 2-1 lead in the series. Leonard had another monster night (36 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists) , joining Elton Brand as the only players in franchise history to run up those numbers in a playoff game. Leonard\u2019s 100 points through his first three playoff games as a Clipper is also a franchise record. It\u2019s the other half of the superstar duo, Paul George, who struggled mightily for the second straight game. George scored just 11 points (on 3-for-16 shooting, 1-for-8 from beyond the 3-point line). He\u2019s managed a combined 25 points on 21-percent shooting in two games after scoring 27 in the Clippers\u2019 Game 1 win. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d George said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t affect us winning tonight.\u201d And it shouldn\u2019t have, with Leonard picking up all the slack. \u201cHe put this game on his back,\u201d George said of Leonard, \u201cand won the game for us.\u201d Leonard did get plenty of help from a supporting cast that finally came to life. Starters Landry Shamet, Marcus Morris and Ivica Zubac alll scored in double figures, as did Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, the Sixth Man of the Year award finalists, who resembled their regular-season selves for the first time in this series. Shamet scored 18 points in his first starting assignment in the series, serving as the ideal complimentary piece with starting point guard Patrick Beverley sideline with that strained calf. \u201cI thought Landry was fantastic,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cHe knows our guys better. He definitely knows our system better. And he\u2019s going to play off of Kawhi and PG and he\u2019s going to let the game come to him. I just thought we needed the ball to be in PG and Kawhi\u2019s hands more and with Sham on the floor you just can\u2019t leave him because he can make shots, so thought he was great.\u201d Morris shot 4-for-5 from deep and finished with 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while providing the relentless defensive pressure on Doncic that keeps Leonard and George from having to regularly expend that energy. The boost certainly allowed Leonard to stay in attack mode all game. \u201cI was just being aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole team was being aggressive and they were helping me get easy shots, I\u2019m just out there playing man, trying to win a basketball game and shots went in for me today.\u201d With all that went right, the Clippers still had to fight off the Mavericks, who got a playoff career-high from Seth Curry (22 points) off the bench and big nights from both Kristaps Porzingis (34 points, 13 rebounds) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (22 pts, 6 reb). They refused to go away without Doncic available. Whether or not they can keep that up, either without Doncic or with him limited because of that ankle injury, will determine how long this series lasts. \u201cObviously Luka being out wasn\u2019t good for us,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cYou know when he tried to come back then his ankle wasn\u2019t right. We need him for the next game, next games, and hopefully the medical staff can get him right so he can be back with us next game.\u201d Doncic actually suffered the injury with 3:58 to play in the third quarter, when he stepped on Leonard\u2019s foot. He had to hop to the locker room with the Mavericks down 86-71. He came back to start the fourth quarter but his mobility wasn\u2019t the same. Frustrated and and clearly still in pain, he went back to the locker room with 9:02 to play with a triple-double (13 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists) already in the books. \u201cI\u2019m unsure of the exact severity of Luka\u2019s left ankle,\u201d Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cOne of the good things is it\u2019s the good ankle, it\u2019s not the one that he\u2019s sprained a few times in the last couple years. We\u2019ll know more tomorrow. He did come back and try it, obviously, and wasn\u2019t moving great. We\u2019ll see where he is come tomorrow and Sunday morning.\u201d Doncic said he could run but could not push off his left left, and simply couldn\u2019t play at the level his team needed him to in the final nine minutes. There\u2019s no guarantee things would have ended any other way with the way Leonard was playing. He was locked in from the start. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the zone,\u201d Doncic said of Leonard. \u201cHe\u2019s a top-three player in the league. It\u2019s really tough to stop him. He\u2019s an amazing player, amazing defender. It\u2019s really hard to stop him. Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Boston trailed by 2 points with 1:39 remaining, before Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker and Marcus Smart carried the Celtics on a 10-0 run to close out the game, and perhaps the 76ers\u2019 season. \u201cI just thought we played with the right poise,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cPlayoff basketball is hard, and Philly\u2019s got talent. They\u2019re physical as hell. They\u2019re big and strong. They lean on you all game. You just have to battle. I just told the team in there, \u2018Three wins doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2019 because you have to do all that that you just exerted again. Our guys did a good job tonight of staying the course, and then a great closing run there.\u201d Here are five takeaways coming out of the most competitive game of this series thus far: Tatum picked up his third foul late in the opening quarter after shooting 2 of 7 from the floor for 5 points. So, Stevens sat Tatum for the entire second quarter. Yet Philadelphia failed to capitalize due to bad shooting in the first half. The Sixers shot 32.8% on field goals over the first two quarters, and 27.8% from deep. Somehow, Philadelphia still found a way with scrappy, hardnosed defense to keep the game close and trailed 51-49 at intermission. The Sixers finished with the lowest field goal percentage (29.5) in a playoff game since the franchise moved to Philadelphia just before the 1963-64 season. For the series, the Sixers are shooting 26% from 3-point range. \u201cWe feel like we played a gameplan that would have enabled us to win,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI thought that defensively, we made good adjustments. I thought we executed those adjustments, especially in some pick and roll schemes. Offensively, I liked the pace. I liked our ability to try to get in the paint, and then kick it off outside with more of a paint-to-great type of mentality. We just couldn\u2019t make a shot. \u201cThe good news of 20 offensive rebounds is a fantastic effort, but lots of that [was] there were lots of rebounds to get. I give our guys credit for continuing to shoot the shots they should have. I give our guys credit for going to the offensive boards. Twenty is a large number, but it\u2019s tough to win when you shoot 29 percent for the game, and 23 percent from the 3. It\u2019s really difficult to do that. We did a lot of good things. We just did not make shots.\u201d Must be nice to be deep enough to survive an off night from Tatum, the leading scorer of the entire series, with a pair of 20-point nights from two other players in Walker (24) and Brown (21). \u201cKemba was the way he\u2019s always been, he was a leader tonight,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cHe carried us. He was special. Especially on certain nights when guys aren\u2019t playing well, he\u2019s more than capable of carrying us to a win, and that\u2019s what he did tonight.\u201d Having dropped 33 points in Game 2 and 32 in Game 1, Tatum (15 points) shot just 6-for-19 from the floor Friday. He struggled with early foul trouble, not to mention Philadelphia\u2019s suffocating defense. \u201cJason, for his age, he just shows so much maturity,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHis poise is second-to-none. He knew he was having a rough night. He never put his head down.\u201d Interestingly, Tatum\u2019s most significant contributions came over the last 1:39 during Boston\u2019s 10-0 run \u2014 with blocks on Embiid and Josh Richardson, in addition to a free throw that extended Boston\u2019s lead to 96-94 with 1:23 remaining. The Celtics owned a 22-8 advantage in fast break points on the night. \u201cAnother sign of a good player, it wasn\u2019t his night on offense,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe was in foul trouble and everything else. But he just kept guarding and did a lot of good things, while Kemba, Marcus and Jaylen made huge plays along with him down the stretch.\u201d Smart nabbed a steal, hit four free throws, and grabbed two rebounds during Boston\u2019s crucial stretch, while Brown chipped in three points. The fourth quarter featured four ties and four lead changes. Walker spent his first eight seasons in Charlotte, where he amassed a record of 3-8 in two postseason appearances before joining the Celtics. So, excuse Walker for feeling a little weird about his current team sitting on the cusp of securing a first-round sweep for the second straight year. \u201cI\u2019m really excited, of course,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to be here, and to be a part of game like this. This is why I came. It\u2019s a really special moment for myself. Obviously, I\u2019ve never been up 3-0. So, this is really cool. But the job\u2019s not done.\u201d You knew the questions were coming about Brown\u2019s job status after Philadelphia dropped a game they were in prime position to win. The Sixers are 8-11 this season without Ben Simmons in the lineup, and 2-6 in the bubble. Outside of the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, where they ran up a record this season of 29-2, the 76ers own a record of 14-31. Plus, we all know that no team in NBA history has ever rallied from an 0-3 series deficit to advance to the next round. \u201cThe historical reference of the daunting task at hand, we all get,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMy mind is truly on trying to find a win. I believe sincerely that wins sometimes change everything, and the mindset, the circumstances. So, in this case, that\u2019s an obvious comment. We\u2019re going to go try to get a win.\u201d Asked whether he worried about his future after Friday\u2019s loss, Brown didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI don\u2019t, I really don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the circumstance. My job is to focus on what I really can do. My players deserve that. I\u2019ve been in the city seven years, and tonight\u2019s loss is what\u2019s most on my mind. My effort truly is to try to find a way to win, keep the series alive, and do my job for my players. I\u2019m not rolling over. \u201cLike everybody would assume that this series is over because we\u2019re out 3-0. I\u2019m not trying to be Knute Rockne, but my sincere opinion is we\u2019re gonna come in and play the game and get a win. To dust it off like it\u2019s delivered for pride purposes, of course. But it\u2019s to keep a series alive. I truly mean that. That\u2019s my message to them. That\u2019s my message to my staff. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d Every game looks the same: Embiid starts off like gangbusters only to fizzle out in the second half. Game 3 was no different, as Embiid dazzled in the first half for 22 points on 6-of-11 from the floor and 2-of-3 from deep to go with 10 rebounds. In the second half, Embiid shot 1-of-9 on FGs for eight points and three rebounds. \u201cLooking at the game tonight, we couldn\u2019t make a shot,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cNothing would go in. We had some mistakes in the fourth that we can correct. Offensively, no one could make a shot. So, you can\u2019t give up. You\u2019ve got to keep fighting. I don\u2019t want to be swept. I don\u2019t want that on my resume.\u201d Embiid might not have much choice if his second-half fortunes don\u2019t change in Game 4. For the series, Embiid is shooting 59% in the first half, and 29% in the second half. In Game 3, Embiid didn\u2019t receive much help once again, as Tobias Harris and Al Horford combined in the second half to shoot 1-for-10. \u201cMan, it sucks when you play super hard. You try to do everything possible to win games,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you come up short. No one wants to be in this position. We can\u2019t give up. We\u2019ve got to do more. I\u2019ve got to do more.\u201d Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here  , find his archive  here   and follow him on Twitter  .

Originally injured in the early minutes of Game 1, when he slipped on that same ankle, Doncic exacerbated the injury with 4 minutes remaining in the third quarter Friday, while sliding over to cut off a Kawhi Leonard drive. Doncic immediately hit the deck and was being looked at as soon as there was a stoppage. He then hopped off the court without putting any weight on the ankle. Yet he could be seen standing in the team huddle during the break between quarters, attempting to jog off the discomfort. He stuck it out long enough to record a 13-10-10 triple-double. But with 9:02 remaining in the fourth, Doncic came up hopping in the middle of another defensive possession, immediately heading offcourt to find a chair. There, he repeatedly checked on the ankle, wincing, and then would place his hands over his face. After a few seconds, he walked gingerly toward the locker room. The Clippers went on to win, 130-122, behind 36 points from Kawhi Leonard.

While Conley was scoring 27 points in his first action since leaving the NBA restart bubble for the birth of son Elijah Michael, the Nuggets were coughing and wheezing metaphorically in their shaky efforts to stop him. Or Utah wing Donovan Mitchell. Or center Rudy Gobert. All three romped in a 124-87 victory that put the Jazz up 2-1 in the series and put Denver within two defeats of exiting the bubble for good. For a coach who prides himself on defense, even when the Nuggets are underperforming on that end, what happened Friday on top of Games 1 and 2 was beyond aggravating. Had someone held up a digital thermometer to Malone\u2019s forehead during or after, he\u2019d have been swarmed by guys in hazmat suits. \u201cWe talked about it going in, how we have yet to take anything away from them,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get beat from the 3-point line, you can\u2019t get beat in the paint and you can\u2019t get beat on the glass. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening for three games now. Where we\u2019ve been dominated in all three of those areas. \u201cSo I would say it starts there.\u201d Denver was a fair defensive team through most of the 2019-20 season, with a D rating of 110.4 and an O rating of 112.6 just good enough to stay in the black. That slipped, though, in its eight seeding games on the Disney campus: 121.7 and 116.9 respectively. Now, through three neutral-court games vs. Utah, things have plunged, particularly on defense: 129.1 and 113.5. The Jazz tore a hole in Friday\u2019s game from the middle of the first quarter to the early minutes of the second, a 23-6 stretch that earned them a 36-16 lead. It never really got better \u2013 well, the Nuggets did get within 14 points shortly after halftime, only to largely comply as Utah outscored them 28-12 over the next eight minutes or so. Falling behind 90-60 is too fat, too glaring of a deficit to ignore. \u201cOur performance tonight was nowhere close to being good enough,\u201d Malone bemoaned, \u201cfrom a an effort standpoint, from a competition standpoint, from a discipline standpoint. They\u2019re paying at a different level than us right now.\u201d What galled Malone \u2013 and his players, hopefully \u2013 is that they\u2019d gone through the same thing in Game 2. It had triggered a heavy video session, pointed instructions and specific adjustments to ensure a better result in Game 3. Instead, Denver got more of the same. It ranks last among the 16 playoff teams in giving up points in the paint (49.3 per game), in second-chance points allowed (16.3) and in sending opponents to the foul line (17.3 attempts). Most of the Jazz\u2019s postseason scoring stats \u2013 18.0 3-pointers made, 13.3 offensive rebounds, 126.3 second chance points, overall field goal percentage (.500) and 3-point percentage (.422) \u2013 are up from what they did all season. Malone had stayed cool in questioning after Game 2, eager to crumple and throw away that box score. Getting a deja pyoo performance, though, brought out more of an edge. Hard to blame him. The Nuggets can cite some possible reasons for defensive lapses, but nothing to excuse the troubles so far. Yes, they miss injured guard Gary Harris, a strong on-ball defender who might make it back from a hip injury before it\u2019s too late. And yes, young forward Michael Porter Jr.\u2019s chops on that end of the floor are well behind his scoring skills. The starting lineup of Porter Jr., Paul Millsap, Nikola Jokic, Torrey Craig and Jamal Murray is largely new. This crew went 1-2 in just three games together, all in the bubble. Now it\u2019s 1-2 vs. Utah. Communication, trust and rotations all can be challenging when players aren\u2019t as familiar with each other. Especially when faced with special assignments such as Mitchell, Gobert and now Conley. Here\u2019s how Jokic described it: \u201cRunning with no reason. We didn\u2019t know what we were doing. It seemed like that. We had energy. We didn\u2019t go the right way.\u201d It\u2019s always tricky to question pro athletes\u2019 effort \u2013 who can crawl inside and really know? \u2013 but that leaves execution. Denver didn\u2019t look crisp against Utah\u2019s stars, whether double-teaming, disrupting its pick-and-roll plays or getting out to contest. Then there\u2019s trouble on offense, stemming from defense. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting any stops, so we have to play against a set defense for 48 minutes,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWhen we do get stops, we\u2019re not rebounding the ball. So we have to play against a set defense for 48 minutes. We are playing against a half court defense the whole night. We\u2019re not getting any easy baskets.\u201d Utah is.

But, not satisfied with a 2-0 series lead, the Raptors ruined the fun of watching Allen make plays, erasing the 22-year-old center from the Brooklyn offense in Game 3 on Friday. After a scare in Game 2, the champs were back to taking care of business. And they put themselves on the brink of their first ever series sweep with an easy 117-92 victory . Offensively, the Raptors got Pascal Siakam going offensively on Friday. After totaling 37 points and four assists through the first two games, the All-Star had 26 and five on Friday. Fred VanVleet remained aflame, scoring 22 points and draining 6 of his 10 3-point attempts. But the Raps are a defensive team first and foremost. Game 3 was another example of how they can turn the screws on that end of the floor, and on this afternoon in Orlando, Allen was the focus of that screw-turning. 12 \u2014 Restricted-area attempts for the Nets in Game 3. The Nets\u2019 16 restricted-area attempts in Game 2 were a season low. And then they got four fewer in Game 3, with only seven restricted-area attempts through the first three quarters. Brooklyn was a bottom-10 shooting team from every area (restricted area, other paint shots, mid-range and 3-point range) this season. But they were, at least, good at getting to the most important of those areas. The Nets ranked third in the percentage of their shots that came in the restricted area (36%). They haven\u2019t been so good at getting to the basket in this series. (Spencer Dinwiddie\u2019s absence hurts in this regard.) And those layups and dunks have become more scarce with every game. Some of the Game 3 shot distribution was by the Nets\u2019 own design. Playing without seven guys who didn\u2019t even make the trip to Orlando and Joe Harris (who left for personal reasons after Game 2), Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn knew his team was outmatched against the defending champs. So he went for a win by variance. \u201cIt was part of our game plan to shoot 50 3s,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cWe were thinking that would give us a chance to be in the game, if we made a good percentage.\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse was on the same page. \u201cWe had talked about them shooting 50-55 3s today,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is pretty smart by them to kind of go in there and do that. They have got some smaller lineups and some guys that can shoot it and let it fly.\u201d And the Raptors employ a defense that will allow you to do so: In the regular season, 44% of their opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s highest rate, came from beyond the arc. Alas, the Nets ranked 26th in 3-point percentage (34.3%) in the regular season and were missing their best shooter. They did reach their goal, attempting 51 3s ( their third-highest total of the season ) on Friday. But they made just 16 (31%) of the 51. And surely, the Nets would have liked a few more layups or dunks, especially from Allen, who shot 72% in the restricted area in the regular season. Allen got fouled twice in the paint, but didn\u2019t have a single field goal attempt in the box score . The Nets\u2019 6-foot-11 center set more than 30 ball screens in Game 3. But not once did he get a clean roll to the rim. Those two trips to the line came off an isolation drive by Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and an after-timeout play for him to catch the ball in the paint after getting a pin-down screen. In Game 2 on Wednesday, the Raptors focused their pick-and-roll defense on LeVert, with their bigs up at the level of the screen to corral the Nets\u2019 primary ball-handler and plenty of space for Allen to roll into and receive a pass: If none of the other three defenders met Allen in the paint, he got all the way to the rim . And if the Raptors rotated to the roll, he kicked the ball out to the open shooter, picking up five assists (all on 3s). With the Nets\u2019 young center having proven himself a pretty adept playmaker and with LeVert having shot 0-for-6 from 3-point range through the first two games, the Raptors switched things up for Game 3. They gave LeVert more space and Allen less. On the Nets\u2019 second possession on Friday, Marc Gasol was out near the 3-point line, but retreating to not allow Allen to get behind him. Not having Harris\u2019 floor spacing and offensive production certainly hurt Brooklyn. And the Nets\u2019 weak-side defenders did do their part in keeping Allen from getting to the rim. But even if Harris was there, the Raptors\u2019 Game 3 scheme required less help off the ball and enabled the other three defenders to stay closer to home on the Nets\u2019 shooters. If Brooklyn was going to take 50 3s, they were going to come from LeVert off the dribble or from more tightly-guarded shooters off the ball. Not only did Allen not get any shots off of rolls to the rim, none of his three assists were from pick-and-roll actions. \u201cWe adjusted some coverages there,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWe kind of changed a lot to not let him get the ball.\u201d The quality of the Raptors\u2019 defense \u2014 which ranked second during the regular season and now ranks second in the playoffs \u2014 goes well beyond their initial execution of the pick-and-roll game plan. Vaughn said that his team\u2019s lack of layups in this series has been \u201cbyproduct of their ability to have multiple efforts.\u201d And maybe the adjustment wasn\u2019t necessary. The Raptors could have won Game 3 by simply improving their execution of the Game 2 game plan. Heck, they won Game 2 despite all of Allen\u2019s damage in the paint. But this team has dreams of another long run in these playoffs, you have to be able to win in different ways, and even against an outmatched opponent, every game is an opportunity to expand and fine-tune your skill set. The \u201cdrop\u201d coverage might not work well against the league\u2019s best pull-up jump-shooting team in the next round (aka the Atlantic Division Finals), but that\u2019s a conversation for another day. And even if the Celtics generally call for the Game 2 game plan, you can\u2019t give a good team just one look. \u201cWe tweaked some things,\u201d VanVleet said, in regard to keeping Allen from getting his catches on Friday. \u201cI think Caris got a little more loose than he did previously due to the scheme change that we did. [We] keep trying to give them different looks and not give them the same look every game. \u201cWe gave Caris a little more. We gave Allen a little less. Obviously we know they missed Joe tonight. We were able to stay home on some of the other guys. It\u2019s a chess match. You\u2019ve got to keep continuing to make adjustments throughout the series.\u201d The Nets might as well try for variance again in Game 4 on Sunday (6:30 ET, TNT), so expect another 50 3-point attempts. They might see more opportunities for LeVert against the drop scheme when they watch the Game 3 film, but they can\u2019t be sure that the Raptors won\u2019t change the scheme again. Maybe the champs will switch everything just for the heck of it. The Raptors will be going for the first playoff series sweep in franchise history. And more important than making history is getting done with the first round so that they can get some rest and start game planning for a likely series against the Celtics, a much tougher opponent than the scrappy Nets. Nurse admitted on Friday that, from night to night, he\u2019s not sure who the eighth man in his rotation will be. (It was Terence Davis on Friday.) No matter what, he\u2019s going to lean heavily on his top seven, a group with championship experience that\u2019s finally healthy. \u201cThey are going to play a lot of minutes for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think taking care of business will help us.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Therefore, it\u2019s almost a regular trip for him, even if this one brings a twist: It\u2019s August, and he\u2019s with a team he\u2019s just getting to know. Iguodala didn\u2019t join the Heat until February, and before the season was halted, he played only 21 games. Even then, his role and minutes were sporadic because of the transition; Iguodala didn\u2019t have the benefit of training camp and hadn\u2019t played all season while sitting out, by mutual agreement with the Grizzlies, until Memphis found a team for him. He\u2019s still in supreme shape at age 36, but what\u2019s more noticeable are the flecks of gray in the hair on the veteran swingman. There\u2019s plenty of wisdom within Iguodala, a major reason why Miami not only traded for him \u2014 surrendering Justise Winslow in the process \u2014 but extended his contract as well. Miami sees itself as a contender, with a mix of veterans and rapidly-developing young talent, both now and the near future. Iguodala was added to bring playoff experience; just five years ago he was Finals MVP and has consistently elevated his play in the postseason. \u201cI feel great,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a good fit for me, and I understand my role, and there\u2019s plenty of reasons to like where this team and this franchise is going.\u201d That wisdom is why he makes for a good interview. There\u2019s plenty of perspective here. Iguodala touched on the Heat, his long-time admiration for team president Pat Riley, why Jimmy Butler seems so angry, why he chose his social justice slogan and also what the Warriors should do with the No. 2 overall pick. (Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited). What\u2019s your conversations been like with coach Erik Spoelstra? We had discussions about the young guys. Had a long discussion about Bam (Adebayo) and how excited we were about him and his progression, the high expectations and how Bam can exceed those expectations. Also we spoke about what he expects from me. Anytime I see a void, I try to come in and fill it. I\u2019ve been able to really get a good feel for different lineups, different groups. For me it\u2019s about identifying what value I bring to the table, how can I mesh with that group. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done throughout my career. There\u2019s more comfortability with the guys now. After being a big part of a Warriors dynasty, what\u2019s the culture like in Miami? This is a place where players can develop, learning how to be a professional. They\u2019ve set the bar for how to get a young guy to understand the game and how to improve, watch the film, work on your game, turn weaknesses into strength. Guys are willing to take criticism and take advice and right away start putting it in their game. That\u2019s all encouraged here and it\u2019s good to see. You\u2019re being a mentor to the young players, Bam and also Tyler Herro. What can you tell us about them? Bam has all the talent in the world. He can be as good as he wants to be. A hard worker, wants to be great, and he will. Tyler has a tighter (dribble) than people think. He\u2019s very confident in his game. Very hard worker, wants to be great. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t teach. Can\u2019t teach someone to have that drive and set high goals and go after them every day. If he has a flaw, he\u2019ll work on that. Like, left-hand passes, that\u2019s something he worked on. It translates to the defensive end too. What about Duncan Robinson? He\u2019s breaking out here in the bubble. Dunc has become a household name. He got Twitter talk now (laughs). I\u2019m on Duncan all the time. I tell him look, you\u2019re 6-8 and shoot the ball the way you do. Your shooting ability will open a world of opportunity. He takes advice to heart. You\u2019ve been a big Pat Riley fan even before joining the Heat. What was it like finally speaking with him? I read his book five years ago, and so hearing his talk, knowing he has this swag about him, I almost laughed a few times when we first talked. I told him I read his book. He explained his book, the teams he coached, how he tried to make them great. As we got deeper into our conversations, I got to see why so many players were attracted to him. A very smooth talker, has a vision, very cool to be around. You\u2019ve played alongside great players in your career. What makes Jimmy Butler believe he belongs in that group? It\u2019s kind of an anger he has, but the anger is funneled in the right direction and that energy is put in the right place. Good players motivate themselves in different ways. For him, it\u2019s the anger he built up inside, done the right way. He holds guys accountable, leads by example, gives up his body. In the past he took some hits for holding guys accountable, but this is a guy who wants to win. Some may take it the wrong way, or take it personally. But what he stands for, his values, are meant to win. Why did you choose Group Economics for your social justice message? I\u2019ve spoken with (former Warriors teammate) David West about how can we solve some of the issues we have in the community. Like, now that we had the protests, what\u2019s next? Take Jay-Z. He took a lot of hits with his partnership with the NFL. The perception that most had about him in this case was the wrong perception. You need to look deeper into what he\u2019s trying to do. It all comes down to economics. We need to understand our real estate, the value of our land, the taxes that go into that and how that money goes into our educational system and law enforcement. And we have large spending dollars amongst us. Should we spend it on ourselves? That\u2019s how you build up communities. So, what should the Warriors do with the No. 2 overall pick, keep it or trade for experienced help? Great question. They may trade it. They\u2019ve been very strategic and smart with how they acquired me, and Draymond (Green) and Klay (Thompson) and how they\u2019ve been able to maneuver within the cap space to get Kevin Durant, and then how they got the trade exception for me. They got a lot of options. They were really smart to look ahead while we were winning. They\u2019re in prime position to keep doing some good things. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

That's never the case","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 I\u2019ve been in this hotel room for 40 straight days. It\u2019s the longest time spent in a space that wasn\u2019t my home, long enough to make me forget what that home feels and looks like. That might seem like an eternity, 40 days. And no doubt, that\u2019s a good amount of time. But this is the life I chose, not just back in July when I first checked in, but decades ago when I first got into this business. There\u2019s a link on most major hotel websites that reveal how many nights you\u2019ve spent in their hotels, and I did some research to uncover this sobering statistic: I\u2019ve spent almost 13 years of my life in a hotel room. This is because I\u2019ve traveled extensively the last 30 years, going to basketball games, baseball games, hockey games, tennis tournaments, golf tournaments, winter Olympics, summer Olympics and other reporting assignments. For several of those years I traveled with an NBA team, which meant 41 road games, then the playoffs and The Finals. And that\u2019s not including leisure travel to visit family, friends and for vacation, and basketball tournaments and track meets with my daughter. Before this NBA trip to Walt Disney World, the longest I spent in a room away from home was 28 days in Sydney, Australia, for the 2000 Olympics. I stayed in a dorm there, which counts as a hotel room for me. So, I\u2019m an expert on hotels. I know when to book, how to get the right price, where to stay in any American city and some international cities. I know about beds and instantly can tell whether one will make for a long night or a comfortable one. I\u2019ve stayed in one-star hotels and five-star ones. Stayed in a hotel that had a mouse (Philadelphia) and one with a suite with a wraparound view of the city (Las Vegas). Stayed at a hotel overlooking a stadium and saw a home run (Toronto) and one overlooking a golf course and saw a birdie (St. Andrews, Scotland) and another overlooking a watering hole and saw a leopard (Kenya). My shortest stay in a hotel was four hours and that was this year in San Francisco. I went to see Luka Doncic play the Golden State Warriors and it just happened to be on a night of a major convention. Every decent hotel in town was booked solid. Even the crappy ones were getting $300 a night if you could find one. I roamed the city after the game, desperate and tired, and finally stumbled upon a room near the airport that charged $450 (normally $100). I checked in at 2 a.m. \u2026 and my flight home was at 7 a.m. Here at the Coronado Springs Resort, inside room 2184, there\u2019s a desk, bed, shower, sink and closet, which means the basics are covered. The small refrigerator is a perk. The view is of the parking lot. It\u2019s a motel-style room, which means your door opens to the elements. It\u2019s on the first floor, normally a strict no-no for me, but I\u2019ve grown to accept it. There\u2019s no complaining in restart basketball. After all these years (roughly 13, actually), most of these rooms tend to look and feel alike. Some are obviously better than others. None can replace the comforts of home. Someday soon, I\u2019ll get back there. But right now, there\u2019s a knock on the door. It\u2019s housekeeping. Again. I\u2019ve already forgotten what it\u2019s like to make my own bed. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

After ranking 20th of 22 teams in offensive efficiency in the seeding games and opening the playoffs by shooting an unbelievably poor 9-for-54 from outside the restricted area on Tuesday, their offense found a little bit of a rhythm. But the Game 2 shot chart wasn\u2019t exactly that of the Steph-and-Klay Warriors. The Lakers still cruised to a 111-88 victory to even the series, 1-1. It was the first of the Blazers\u2019 11 bubble games that wasn\u2019t within five points in the last five minutes, and it wasn\u2019t within 20 in the last five. Despite the better-but-still-not-great shooting, the Lakers had a 30-point lead at the end of the third quarter. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit four 3-pointers and Anthony Davis hit three, but perimeter shooting was still a struggle for the rest of the rotation. The Lakers\u2019 14-for-38 (37%) showing from 3-point range was a little better than league average (36%). Their 7-for-22 (32%) on non-restricted-area 2s was below average (40%). That was good enough, because the shooting was much worse on the other end of the floor. 58 \u2014 Blazers points through three quarters. This was a relatively slow-paced game, but it wasn\u2019t that slow. The Blazers scored those 58 points on 72 offensive possessions, a rate of just 81 per 100. Even with a 30-point fourth quarter comprised mostly of garbage time, this was the Blazers\u2019 least efficient offensive game of the season (88 points on 96 possessions). In regard to his team\u2019s poor shooting of the last few weeks, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said before Game 2 that \u201cthe percentages will come around.\u201d But his players didn\u2019t wait for that to happen. Offensively, they didn\u2019t need jumpers because they attacked the basket, scoring 20 of their 27 first-quarter points in the restricted area . Defensively, the Lakers got after it. Portland had the No. 1 offense in the seeding games, but through the first three quarters Thursday, the Blazers\u2019 shooting numbers (10-for-42 from outside the restricted area) looked like those of the Lakers over the last few weeks. With every series having played two games, the No. 1 offense of the seeding games (122.5 points scored per 100 possessions) is the worst offense of the playoffs (94.5 per 100). It was clear early on that the Lakers were not going to let Damian Lillard (34 points in Game 1, 18 in Game 2) shake loose. On the Blazers\u2019 third possession of the game, Carmelo Anthony and Jusuf Nurkic set a double-screen a few feet into the frontcourt, and both of their defenders \u2014 LeBron James and JaVale McGee were waiting for Lillard on the other side of those screens. A little bit later in the first quarter, Davis and McGee were downright jumpy in their effort to prevent Lillard from stepping into an open look as he navigated around staggered screens from Wenyen Gabriel and Nurkic. When the Lakers are showing bodies defensively, they\u2019re showing big bodies. A frontline of James, Davis and McGee is tough to see or shoot over. The ESPN broadcast had James mic\u2019d up, and at one point, he told his teammates \u201cWe\u2019re built different.\u201d After the game, James\u2019 explanation for that comment was more abstract: \u201cIt\u2019s about our mind set,\u201d he said. But really, the Lakers are built different. What they lack in perimeter playmaking and shooting, they can make up for \u2014 to some degree on offense and to a much greater degree on defense \u2014 with size and athleticism. (Lillard left Game 2 with a dislocated left finger and his status for Game 3 remains unknown.) Here are some more examples of how they defended Lillard and CJ McCollum from the first quarter of Game 2: Play 1 Caldwell-Pope \u201cices\u201d a high screen set by Nurkic, keeping Lillard on the sideline. James is initially in position to defend in that direction, but that\u2019s really where McGee (Nurkic\u2019s defender) should be. When James retreats to his man (Anthony), Lillard attacks. But by the time he gets to the paint, he\u2019s met by the 7-foot McGee and the 6-foot-10 Davis. Play 2 On the ensuing inbounds play, Lillard beats Danny Green back door, but Davis reacts quickly and again meets the Blazers\u2019 star at the rim. Play 3 McCollum gets nearly the same pick-and-roll treatment as Lillard, with Markieff Morris stepping up beyond the 3-point line. McCollum gives the ball up and Hassan Whiteside takes a mid-range jumper with 10 seconds still left on the shot clock. Play 4 Though Anthony\u2019s screen is at least 35 feet from the basket, Morris comes up to the level of the screen and stays with the ball until Alex Caruso recovers to double-team Lillard and make him pick up the ball. Anthony is open, but Caruso\u2019s pressure makes Lillard change his passing angle and throw a wraparound bounce pass. That extra half a second allows Morris to get back just in time to prevent a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer. The step-back 2 that Anthony settles on is a much better shot for the Lakers. Play 5 The Blazers don\u2019t bring any screens for Lillard, but the Lakers don\u2019t let him play 1-on-1. Kyle Kuzma leaves Mario Hezonja to zone up beyond the 3-point line and James shades toward the dangerous Gary Trent Jr. Hezonja is open in the corner, but James sees the pass coming and gets his hand on it. After the win, Davis explained the game plan against Lillard and McCollum: \u201cMake those guys beat us with scoring 2s. They\u2019re a really great 3-point shooting team and we just try to take those shots away and make somebody else beat us. When they do have the ball in their hands, force them into the 2-point area and live with a contest. If they make it, we tip our hats to \u2019em. We really want to take away that 3.\u201d The game plan wasn\u2019t necessarily different than it was on Tuesday. The Lakers just executed it better. Lillard\u2019s first 3 in Game 1 came when Morris wasn\u2019t the right position when Nurkic set a high screen. Lillard also got a layup later in the first quarter when Morris was late with a no-screen double-team and Davis was late to protect the rim. \u201cWhen you have a defensive strategy,\u201d James explained, \u201cyou have to execute that defensive strategy for 48 minutes or for the minutes that they\u2019re on the floor. And I think we did a great job of that tonight.\u201d After scoring 28 points in 39 minutes on 8-for-24 shooting in Game 1, Davis scored 31 in 29 minutes on 13-for-21 in Game 2. Asked about the difference in his two performances, he pointed to the other end of the floor. \u201cThere were plays [in Game 1] on the defensive end that I usually make,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI was hesitant in rotations. They were getting a lot of easy layups at the rim, offensive rebounds. And that\u2019s all an effort and energy thing. So I just tried to make the adjustment to play free. I know the reads and I know the rotations that I have to make, and we were all on a string tonight.\u201d Davis has always had the tools to be one of the NBA\u2019s best defensive players. In his eighth season and playing under one of the best defensive coaches of the last 10 years, he\u2019s got the experience and direction to know where to be and when to be there. When he\u2019s engaged defensively, he\u2019s a destructive force on that end of the floor. He had just one steal and one block in Game 2, but with his length and activity, Davis occupied the space that the Blazers needed to get clean looks at the basket. If the Lakers remain this engaged defensively, the Blazers will continue to have a tough time scoring in Game 3 on Saturday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC ). Game 2 wasn\u2019t just the Blazers\u2019 least efficient game of the season, it was also the first time since December, 2018 that Portland has been held under a point per possession in two straight games. The Blazers could see if they can get Lillard better shots by playing him more off the ball and allowing him to attack a defense that\u2019s on the move. His best look on Thursday ( the one 3-pointer he made ) came when the Lakers doubled a Nurkic post-up and put themselves in rotation, with Lillard side-stepping Caldwell-Pope\u2019s close-out. Of course, that double was a result of the Blazers playing two centers against an L.A. lineup that had Davis at the five. We might not see that matchup for too many minutes in any particular game, and the Lakers have actually been much better defensively with Davis at the five so far. Through the first two games, they\u2019ve allowed 73 points on 67 Portland possessions (1.09 per) with Davis at the four alongside McGee or Dwight Howard. But with Davis at center, they\u2019ve allowed just 61 points on 81 defensive possessions ( 0.75 per ). For the Blazers to get another win in this series, Lillard and McCollum need help. Everyone else in the Blazers\u2019 rotation has has combined to shoot 38% in this series. The Lakers\u2019 offense still hasn\u2019t looked great. But they\u2019ve made the Blazers\u2019 offense, which was ridiculously efficient entering this series, look even worse. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

OK, on to the conference semifinals\u2026 Not so fast. The Bucks did what they had to do so save face, soothe their feelings and avoid the unthinkable. They played harder than in Game 1, admittedly a ninny boast for a team with championship ambitions. They blitzed the Magic defensively, disrupting this time what had flowed so well two days earlier. They built a big lead early and protected it late \u2014 again, admirable but nothing to write home about from the bubble, not in a No. 1 vs. No. 8 showdown. But Milwaukee let Orlando hang around and eventually feel OK about itself, considering the misses and mistakes the Magic had. That\u2019s an opportunity lost in a series that\u2019s now best-of-five, against an underdog with nothing to lose, trying to cover for an All-Star \u2014 Khris Middleton \u2014 who still is MIA. The Bucks fired back by getting to work on defense, dialing up Eric Bledsoe to chase and pester Orlando\u2019s Markelle Fultz like the All-Defensive talent he is. Bledsoe was active instead of passive this time, getting a block, a steal and generally under the Magic players\u2019 skin in the first quarter. Those opening 12 minutes were everything you\u2019d expect in a mismatch of maximum seedings. Orlando managed only three field goals on 23 shots, including 1-of-11 from 3-point range. The Bucks put all their energy into that end, shot 38.5% (2-for-9 from the arc) and had six turnovers, and still led 25-13. Let\u2019s break down the rest though: Over the final three quarters, the teams essentially were even (86-83, Bucks). Orlando put up 30 points in both the second and third quarters, crossing a defensive red line for Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. Meanwhile, they outscored and outshot the Bucks in the second half. Milwaukee felt good afterward because this is a bottom-line business. No apologies for winning, right? Also, some guys who hadn\u2019t shined lately managed to. There was a sense of equilibrium being restored from Tuesday. The Bucks, after all, put up 111 points, pretty much like Game 1 (110). But instead of giving up 122, they stopped the Magic at 94. Twenty-six point swings are good for a defensive-oriented team\u2019s soul. \u201cThey were really good. We took a lot of quick shots early in the game,\u201d said Orlando coach Steve Clifford, who knows his way around strong defense. \u201cAgainst them, you\u2019ve got to get the ball moving. We didn\u2019t do that early \u2026 Their ball pressure, they were into us more.\u201d The Bucks are competing not just against Eastern Conference rivals in this tournament \u2014 they\u2019re facing expectations and ghosts of their own selves. They have gone from regular-season dazzlers in 2018-19 to playoff disappointments, back to dazzlers and now to something TBD. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a different mentality,\u201d said backup wing Pat Connaughton, indispensable Thursday with 15 points, 11 rebounds and two blocked shots that helped keep the Magic distanced. \u201cLast year we had that chip on our shoulder because nobody believed in us,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cThis year, according to the outside world, we\u2019re favorites. So we need to bring ourselves back to that chip on our shoulder mentality \u2026 that we started this culture on at the beginning of last season.\u201d Connaughton, Kyle Korver and Brook Lopez made the Bucks nearly whole on offense by taking and making the shots made available by Orlando\u2019s necessary obsession stopping Giannis Antetokounmpo. That whole build-a-wall strategy is only effective if a) the Bucks star is forcing his own offense rather than passing to the perimeter, or b) those snipers are missing. This was a just-right combination, allowing the Bucks to recognize themselves. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t like seeing that wall. I like playing 1-on-1,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to play with what the defense gives you.\u201d Said Nikola Vucevic, the Orlando center who scored 32 to go with his 35 from Game 1: \u201cEspecially early on, Giannis was doing a good job getting us to commit. Once they start hitting 3s, you have a tendency to spread and get a little more out to the shooters.\u201d That\u2019s when Antetokounmpo finds bricks missing in those walls. He had 28 points, 20 rebounds and five assists, along with seven turnovers and four fouls. If Vucevic can keep up with Antetokounmpo (or nearly so) and Bledsoe\/George Hill don\u2019t lose out to Fultz\/D.J. Augustin at point guard, the next matchup that matters is Middleton vs. Evan Fournier. They are their team\u2019s second-leading scorers, but right now it\u2019s a coin flip which one finds rhythm first. Fournier has made only 7-of-21 shots, Middleton just 5-of-20. Middleton is a two-time All-Star in Year 1 of a $177-million max deal. Fournier never has sniffed that status as a player, with a contract half that size. Besides, one guy\u2019s team has The Finals in mind, the other\u2019s does not. What can the Bucks do to help Middleton get going? Essentially, Antetokounmpo said, trust him. \u201cJust don\u2019t bother him,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great scorer. I think the team, we keep talking to him. Obviously we\u2019re gong to encourage him but we\u2019re not going to overstep. \u201cHe knows what he needs to do. I\u2019ve seen Khris come off a bad game and score 30, 35. \u2026 In Game 3, he\u2019s going to be great.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It\u2019s an odd and frustrating dichotomy, for sure, for the best pure point guard of the last decade and a half. Here it is, the middle of August, where the NBA was forced to find a safe space from the pandemic. With autumn approaching, it is getting late in 2020 and perhaps too late for Paul. He\u2019s locked in a first-round series with his former team, a series that was designed to be tightly contested between the Thunder and Rockets, a series that has yet to see Russell Westbrook on the floor and saw a Game 2 disappearance from MVP contender James Harden. And yet Paul is down 0-2, and another early playoff departure is crystalizing, and that elusive title chase is ready to receive another coating of grease. Paul\u2019s wealth, as you know, is confined to dead presidents, not jewels. And because he\u2019s prideful and ultra-competitive, that\u2019s what he seeks: the ring that remains well in the distance. In 15 seasons he\u2019s been to the playoffs 11 times but just once to the conference finals. What failed to happen with a young and frisky team in New Orleans, then \u201cLob City\u201d in L.A., and a brief-yet-ultimately troubled collaboration with Harden in Houston, seems remote with Oklahoma City where the basketball identity is currently under construction. The Rockets used a 17-0 run in the fourth quarter Thursday to flip Game 2 for good. Most amazing was Harden during that stretch was on the bench, saddled by poor shooting \u2014 he missed eight of his first nine shots from deep \u2014 and was reduced to cheering next to Westbrook. Meanwhile, OKC squandered a terrific opportunity to invite suspense into the series before Westbrook returns from a quad injury, perhaps for Game 3. \u201cIn a regular world, not a bubble, we\u2019d be going back home for two games,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe gotta take it one game at a time, learn from this game, and hell, I gotta show up. That simple.\u201d Paul took ownership because he scored 14 points on 15 shots and was never a serious factor. He only had two assists, uncharacteristic for him. \u201cI gotta do more. Straight up,\u201d he said. Curiously, this was one of Paul\u2019s finest seasons, given the circumstances. His leadership and wisdom and All-Star play \u2014 yes, Paul remains elite after 1,124 career regular season and playoff games \u2014 became one of the league\u2019s pleasant surprises. After losing Paul George and then Westbrook in a hectic shakeup summer of 2019, the Thunder placed their fate in the hands of Paul, who never fumbled when his three previous teams did the same. For what it\u2019s worth, the projections had OKC piddling along as an average team, straddling the playoff fence. Then the Thunder shattered that theory by winning 44 of 72 games and finished in a tie for fourth with Houston. Much was due to Paul, who reported with a great attitude, accepted the challenge of leading a new and disrupted squad, never asked for a trade \u2014 the remaining two years and $88 million on his contract made that moot anyway \u2014 and uplifted the mood and level of his teammates. He averaged 17.6 points, 6.7 rebounds and over two steals, cementing his reputation as an impactful two-way point guard. That\u2019s why he soured on himself after Game 2. \u201cMy guys worked as hard we could, fought really hard and we put ourselves in position and I let this one get away from us,\u201d he said. Paul\u2019s only conference final appearance was two seasons ago with the Rockets, when he suffered a hamstring injury and had to watch the Rockets miss 27 straight 3s against the Golden State Warriors in Game 7. Before that, he had five first-round exits, twice in his final two seasons with the Clippers, when Paul had All-Stars around him. Last year after getting bounced in the second round, Paul and Harden had philosophical differences which led to the swap for Westbrook. The ball didn\u2019t always bounce his way. The NBA nixed the trade from New Orleans which would\u2019ve put Paul with Kobe Bryant. Paul and Blake Griffin had untimely injuries that cost them playoff series with the Clippers. There was Paul\u2019s hamstring in Houston, and suddenly, he\u2019s pushing toward the wrong side of 35 and lacks All-Star teammates in OKC. He\u2019s on the path traveled by Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Dominique Wilkins and John Stockton, all great players who left without the champagne bath. Because of his hefty contract, Paul may need to stay in OKC until it expires two summers from now and then go ring-chasing (when he\u2019ll be 37). His most recent team, the Rockets, don\u2019t appear all shook up about losing him. They\u2019ve resorted to a small-ball approach that ultimately will decide the fate of Mike D\u2019Antoni in Houston, with P.J. Tucker forced to surrender 5-to-6 inches in the post against opposing bigs. Yet if it\u2019s a desperate gimmick to win Harden a ring, at least it\u2019s got Houston two games ahead of Paul, after they held OKC under 100 points Thursday. TV analyst Jeff Van Gundy said about the Rockets: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to commit this hard defensively, they can win it all.\u201d That would be salt into the wound for a generational point guard who\u2019s still thirsty for his sip. Chris Paul has fallen behind the pace, once again, even here in summertime, where he always wanted to play. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Minutes after Houston took a 2-0 series lead over Oklahoma City in the Western Conference playoffs, the coach\u2019s attempt at funny fell flat. \u201cI just told the team all we did was defend homecourt,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got to go to Oklahoma City to play. They kind of laughed at me. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d Bad jokes aside, what observers need to understand is this year\u2019s Houston squad might just be the real deal. General Manager Daryl Morey and D\u2019Antoni seem to have finally added the right ingredients to add pop to the Rockets superstar stew, which features James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who sat out of Thursday\u2019s 111-98 victory due to a quadriceps injury. On an afternoon in which Houston launched an NBA playoff-record 56 shots from 3-point range \u2014 missing 66.1% of them \u2014 with Harden struggling offensively, the Rockets toppled the Thunder through suffocating defense and a magical fourth-quarter run, one engineered with the 2018 MVP cheering from the bench. Harden had shot just 2-for-12 from the field in through the first three quarters and 1-for-9 from 3-point range, with eight assists. So, for a minute, you thought this cheering sequence might serve as Harden\u2019s most significant contribution in this contest. https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nba\/status\/1296564587177873408 But please believe Harden had plenty of reasons for all the yelling and clapping. With Harden on the bench and Houston trailing 78-77 to start the fourth quarter, the Rockets embarked on a game-changing frenzy that transformed the deficit into a 12-point lead by the time he checked back into the game. \u201cUnbelievable, man. That was the game right there,\u201d said Harden, who scored a team-high 21 points. \u201cThe guys just took it upon themselves to guard, and we felt a sense that Oklahoma City was getting tired. We just kept pressing the gas on them. That was the game-changer right there for us. Huge shoutout to D-House [Danuel House Jr.], Jeff [Green], Tuck [P.J. Tucker], all the guys that were in in that fourth quarter. [Eric] Gordon made some big plays and then made some big shots.\u201d Just 12 seconds into the fourth quarter, Houston started off a 17-0 run that saw the Rockets comfortably ahead when Harden checked back in with 7:23 left to play. Houston\u2019s defense sent Oklahoma City into a scoring drought that lasted 5 minutes and 14 seconds during that sequence. Luguentz Dort finally ended it with a 26-footer off a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander assist to cut Houston\u2019s lead to 11. \u201cOur defense has taken a couple of steps up,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe knew that was going to be the key. The guys just bought in. They locked in. You\u2019re going to have uneven nights offensively, but even with the uneven night offensively, we hung in there until we got the offense going. The second group that came in when James was resting did an unbelievably great job defensively. Then, they hit some shots with Danuel House, P.J., Eric and Jeff played a good game again.\u201d Houston\u2019s backups, featuring three players in Green, Ben McLemore and Austin Rivers, outscored OKC\u2019s quintet of reserves 32-20. The Rockets also scored 13 points off Oklahoma City\u2019s 14 turnovers, nabbing eight steals in addition to blocking three shots with a stingy, switching defense that helped them outscore the Thunder 58-40 in the second half. Offensively, Houston dished 21 assists with seven turnovers for the game. The Rockets also strung together a 16-2 run to start the third quarter, holding OKC scoreless for 7 minutes and 5 seconds. During the game-changing sequence to start the fourth quarter, the Rockets feasted on a pair of 3-pointers from Green \u2014 who scored all of his 15 points in the second half \u2014 and a steal from Gordon that was converted into a 3-pointer, in addition to another long-range connection from House. House, Green, Tucker and Gordon would combine for 23 points in the fourth quarter, with Harden putting the finishing touches on the win with 11 points on 3 of 4 from the floor and 1 of 2 from range. Tucker finished the game perfect (4-for-4) from 3-point range, totaling 14 points. \u201cIt\u2019s not pride, it\u2019s just team energy,\u201d said House, who finished with 19 points. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have great leaders such as Harden, Russ, E.G., all the older guys that are instilling confidence within me.\u201d The performance should also add a sense of conviction within the organization in the supporting cast\u2019s ability to perform whenever Hardin struggles, and with Westbrook still out of action. It\u2019s unknown when Westbrook will return to the lineup from his quadriceps injury, but Houston\u2019s Game 2 performance gives it confidence it can take its time in putting him back on the floor. \u201cIt starts on the defensive end, but we\u2019ve got some really good offensive players out there without James,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be careful with Russ. He\u2019s too valuable to just throw out there. We can\u2019t wait to get him back. But this does help. It helps a lot of different areas.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Don\u2019t pump fake. We need you.\u2019 And you could see it, he didn\u2019t hesitate today and that\u2019s how we want him.\u201d Jimmy Butler didn\u2019t bother with the words, he simply force-fed Robinson the ball at the start of the game and watched him drain three straight to start the game. When the Heat veterans sends a message, it finds the target. After a quiet Game 1 showing in Tuesday\u2019s win over the Pacers, Robinson went off in Thursday afternoon\u2019s 109-102 Game 2 victory . He tied Mike Miller\u2019s franchise playoff record, shooting 7-for-8 \u2014 all on 3s, and finishing with a team-high 24 points as the Heat set the franchise playoff record for made 3-pointers (18). Robinson was 6-for-6, making another three straight in the third quarter as the Heat built a double-digit lead, before he missed. \u201cI think I speak for everybody when I say we\u2019re all happy for Duncan,\u201d Butler said. \u201cHe did what he\u2019s done for us all year and we know he\u2019s going to continually do that and do his part for what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d Butler and Dragic relish their roles as the leaders of a Heat team full of \u201cunderdogs,\u201d from ageless franchise cornerstone Udonis Haslem to rookie point guard Kendrick Nunn and the sharpshooter Robinson, each an undrafted player who found a vital role in Miami. Robinson might be the most improbable story off all, having transitioned from an off-the-radar high school recruit from Maine to a prep school standout and Division III star as a freshman at Williams before making the leap to Division I at Michigan. A sharpshooter at every stop, Robinson was the first to play in both the D-I and D-III men\u2019s basketball title game. But even with the most valuable skill talent evaluators look for in today\u2019s NBA, Robinson still went undrafted. He lacked that elite athleticism required to project as a NBA prospect, let alone a starter, which is exactly what he\u2019s become in his second season with the Heat. The franchise\u2019s penchant for searching high and low for players who fit into the Heat culture certainly helped his cause, as did continued physical growth and development. It\u2019s a program that has served the Heat well since Pat Riley came aboard more than two decades ago. \u201cWe believe in those kinds of stories,\u201d said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of guys come through here on a similar path. And this started with Pat. He\u2019s always believed in the player development program and giving guys a chance, going back to his Knicks days with [John] Starks and [Anthony] Mason, guys that have to come up a different way. And then one of our faces of the franchise, Udonis Haslem, was not drafted and came up through our player development program. \u201cSo guys that are committed and have incredible persistence, we want to show belief in them if that truly is their dream. And Duncan is incredibly persistent. He\u2019s got a lot of grit to him. So he\u2019s created a lot of these opportunities for himself, just with his work ethic and his daily commitment to get better.\u201d Butler, for one, loves the make up this Heat team. He sought the Heat out in free agency last summer for the exact things they are putting on display in this series, for the things Robinson showed in bouncing back from a forgettable Game 1 showing to light up the building in Game 2. There\u2019s a genuine connection and camaraderie with this group that is evident in the way they function, on and off the court. Butler was the 30th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, somewhat overlooked himself, as the final pick of the first round. He understands the mentality that drives so many who have worn the jersey before him and now, even if he doesn\u2019t understand how the Heat always seem to find the guys who fall between the cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Butler said. \u201cSome people look for youth, experience \u2026 it ain\u2019t my job to do all that. But I do know that the Miami Heat look for those diamonds in the rough, guys with that grit, that dog and underdog mentality and all of that. We got a roster full of them. I love going to war with these guys. We play so hard, we play for one another and I think that\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve been successful all year long.\u201d That mentality and the splendid balance on the roster has certainly turned this team \u2014 one that entered this season with little-to-no expectation of being a contender, outside of perhaps their own locker room \u2014 into a real factor with things seemingly wide open in the bubble. It\u2019s a perfect fit for Robinson, who won\u2019t allow a poor showing to change anything about his grind. Sure, this Heat team has prioritized enjoying each other\u2019s success all season \u2014 Bam Adebayo earned his first All-Star nod, Nunn is one of the finalists for Rookie of the Year and Robinson has emerged as one of the league\u2019s most lethal long-range shooters \u2014 and the collective success that comes with outplaying the external expectations. But they are mindful never to stray too far from the main thing: the chase for the rings. That\u2019s why he leaned into a relationship with Miller during the four-month season shutdown, like-minds from different eras who understand the Heat culture like only those who have lived it can. Miller\u2019s 7-for-8 showing from deep came in the clinching game of The Finals in 2012, the first of two championships won by the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh-led \u201cHeatles\u201d. Miller was one of those valued role players who carved out a place in the Heat record books with his shooting, the same way Robinson has this season. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever feel normal,\u201d Robinson said, of his name being attached to those lists. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, I like it that way. It\u2019s incredibly humbling to be mentioned in the same sentence as some of these guys, just because of what they were able to do. \u201cI just try to be the best version of myself and they certainly inspire me in my play, particularly Mike. He reached out to me over quarantine and we\u2019ve been able to connect. He\u2019s been huge, always been in my ear, been texting me since I\u2019ve been down here. So he\u2019s been like a great vet to me. Just to be mentioned in the same sentence, and he obviously did it on a significantly higher stage \u2026 so there\u2019s a lot more for me to go, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

In body cam footage, Alameda, Calif., deputy Alan Strickland was seen shoving Ujiri twice as he attempted to join the team\u2019s championship celebration. The following is an official statement from Raptors team president Masai Ujiri: Thank you to everybody who has expressed disappointment and concern regarding the video that was recently released. My family and I are deeply grateful for your care and consideration. The video sadly demonstrates how horribly I was treated by a law enforcement officer last year in the midst of my team, the Toronto Raptors, winning its first world championship. It was an exhilarating moment of achievement for our organization, for our players, for our city, for our country, and for me personally, given my long-tenured professional journey in the NBA. Yet, unfortunately, I was reminded in that moment that despite all of my hard work and success, there are some people, including those who are supposed to protect us, who will always and only see me as something that is unworthy of respectful engagement. And, there\u2019s only one indisputable reason why that is the case \u2013 because I am Black. What saddens me most about this ordeal is that the only reason why I am getting the justice I deserve in this moment is because of my success. Because I\u2019m the President of a NBA team, I had access to resources that ensured I could demand and fight for my justice. So many of my brothers and sisters haven\u2019t had, don\u2019t have, and won\u2019t have the same access to resources that assured my justice. And that\u2019s why Black Lives Matter. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for all of us to keep demanding justice. Justice for George. Justice for Breonna. Justice for Elijah. Justice for far too many Black lives that mattered. And justice for Black people around the world, who need our voice and our compassion to save their lives. Those are the ties that bind us.

He\u2019s 29, was cut by the Grizzlies last summer, came off the bench this season for the Lakers and earns less money from the team than Luol Deng (who took a buyout and retired three years ago). The player in question, Avery Bradley, isn\u2019t with the Lakers right now either, as he opted out of the restart because of family reasons. His absence is already being felt just one game into the playoffs, where the Lakers are missing the two elements that Bradley brings: 3-point shooting and the quickness to annoy high-scoring opposing guards. It just so happens that the title-contending Lakers are abysmal at both right now, and that\u2019s why they trail the No. 8-seeded Portland Trail Blazers 1-0 in their first-round series . Is a lineup shuffling coming already? It would likely mean elevating Kyle Kuzma from sixth man if only to put a shooter on the floor with LeBron and Anthony Davis for extended minutes and set the tone from the beginning. \u201cIf they call on me to start, you guys have seen what I do,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cTry to come in and be myself, play fun, play free spirited.\u201d There is a simpler method, he conceded. \u201cIt\u2019s plan and simple: We got to hit shots.\u201d No question, the Lakers are hardly in serious trouble against Portland, not in a best-of-seven. They do bring LeBron and Davis, a pair of superstars who serve as deodorant to almost any basketball odor. LeBron opened his first playoffs with the Lakers with an impressive triple-double. Davis was brilliant \u2014 at least for a half \u2014 before tailing off considerably as the Lakers were outscored by 20 when he was on the floor. But this season for the Lakers has high ambitions that go well beyond a rejuvenated Blazers team. This is supposed to be LeBron\u2019s year. This was his chance to team with the most talented big man he\u2019s ever had, win a title and restore the polish to the Lakers\u2019 franchise. How can they do this when the Lakers can\u2019t make shots from deep and defensively must deal with guards galore, starting with Lillard and potentially continuing against Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul or Jamal Murray in subsequent playoff rounds? Or, imagine if they get slayed by Lillard, are ruined by their own shooting issues and get sent back to L.A. by next week, contrite and confused? That would be seismic. In addition to the grief that Davis would take to his reputation \u2014 Davis hasn\u2019t taken a team anywhere special \u2014 and the missed opportunity for LeBron at age 35, the ripple effect would go beyond the Lakers. They\u2019re easily the main attraction in these playoffs and TV ratings could drop along with the mood in L.A. if the Lakers can\u2019t make it to September. Lillard is a problem. He\u2019s on a career roll, a proud veteran and feared scorer looking to ramp up his basketball cred by taking a scalp as big as the Lakers. He\u2019s also hungry to win that elusive championship. Lillard\u2019s only smudge in Orlando happened when he missed free throws in the final seconds of a seeding game vs. the LA Clippers. Since then, he\u2019s taken his game into another stratosphere. His stretchy shooting range and ability to slice into the paint for layups or find open teammates is confusing the Lakers\u2019 defense. The Blazers also bring Lillard\u2019s carbon copy in CJ McCollum, who\u2019s capable of dropping shots by the dozens himself and creating ones for teammates. The problem for L.A. is a lack of worthy defenders for those two (and especially Lillard). This might be eased somewhat when Rajon Rondo returns for Game 2 from injury \u2026 except Rondo hasn\u2019t played meaningful basketball since March and he\u2019s far from the defender he was in his Boston Celtics days. Also, Rondo\u2019s not efficient from deep, which brings us to the Lakers\u2019 other and more significant issue, an inability to get teams to respect their outside shooters. The Lakers ranked last in 3-point shooting during the restart (30.3%) and are at 15.6% from deep after one playoff game. Defenses are starting to double-up on LeBron and Davis without fearing any price to be paid for that. The Lakers were five-for-32 from deep Monday and their stars, LeBron and Davis, aren\u2019t natural 3-point shooters (they went a combined 0-for-10 from deep). If Kuzma, Danny Green, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and assorted others can\u2019t take advantage of open shots, or even create their own 3-point opportunities, when will the Lakers pay the ultimate price for this failure? Next round? The conference finals? The Finals? This round? They haven\u2019t looked like potential champions since before the reboot. Back then, they had just chopped down arguably their two biggest threats, the Clippers and Bucks, and came to Orlando feeling frisky. Yet they also came to Orlando without Bradley and it was only a matter of time before everyone noticed. The effect of Bradley\u2019s loss is just limited to two areas, which happen to be the two areas of weakness for the Lakers. Therefore, his absence is magnified beyond his actual worth. Bradley was a reasonably decent 3-point shooter (36.4% this season) and gave the Lakers another option in case any of their other shooters turned chilly. A former two-time All-Defensive team selection, Bradley has a long-earned reputation for defense. With LeBron unable to stick with smaller and quicker guards and Rondo coming to this series rusty, Bradley was a preferred option whenever the Lakers saw Lillard types. Besides changing Kuzma\u2019s role, Lakers coach Frank Vogel will now search for reinforcements. That likely means more playing time for JR Smith and Dion Waiters, a pair of late-season pickups who weren\u2019t in demand. \u201cIn any series with any team, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll consider and evaluate,\u201d Vogel said. Yes, just a few days into the playoffs, it\u2019s already all hands on deck for the Lakers, who can\u2019t allow the Blazers\u2019 confidence to expand much larger. \u201cIt\u2019s one game,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident with our group. We (just) didn\u2019t make shots, you know what I mean? I think we can shoot better than we did.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The chaos that began with both No. 1 seeds falling on Tuesday was extended for another night on the NBA campus at Walt Disney World in Orlando. The No. 7 seed Dallas Mavericks did the honors this time, outplaying the No. 2 seed LA Clippers from opening tip to final buzzer in a 127-114 win , evening their first-round series at 1-1. Both the Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks suffered Game 1 losses Tuesday, the Lakers losing to Portland and the Bucks to the Orlando Magic. The Clippers, the third of the big three favorites, as deep and versatile as any team in the bubble, finally succumbed to the upset vibes as well. If Tuesday\u2019s upsets put a legitimate scare into the higher seeds, the Clippers losing the way they did gives these unprecedented playoffs a wide open, anyone-can-win-it-all feel. The seasoned Clippers boast a two-time Finals MVP in Kawhi Leonard, veteran stars with extensive playoff experience like Paul George and they still couldn\u2019t solve a Mavericks team whose two best players \u2014 Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis \u2014 are getting their first taste of the postseason. \u201cThey are a good team and it just goes to show you the West is tough,\u201d George said. \u201cEight seed just beat the one seed yesterday. So it tells you, the West is tough. It\u2019s a tough conference. Any given night, any team, especially here, can win. And we full on seen that. So it\u2019s no surprise. What you have to do is come to play. And tonight was their night.\u201d We\u2019re toes deep into uncharted waters and no one, not even the juggernauts from before the nearly five-month shutdown of the season due to the coronavirus pandemic, is completely safe. The Mavericks executed the most efficient offense in NBA history to perfection at times Wednesday night, even with Doncic battling foul trouble throughout. He sat for more than seven minutes of the fourth quarter after picking up his fifth foul \u2026 and the Mavericks extended the lead without him on the floor. It was the Dallas bench \u2014 Trey Burke (16 points), Seth Curry (15), Boban Marjanovic (13) and Delon Wright (3) in particular \u2014 that proved to be the biggest difference. Their 47 points, which included clutch playmaking and shot-taking, went a long way in helping sustain the momentum engineered by Doncic, Porzingis and the starting unit. \u201cWe came into this game ready,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cWe jumped into the game right away and obviously there were a lot of runs and a lot of things happening and a lot of emotions throughout the game. But I felt like we did a pretty good job keeping our composure throughout the game and playing our basketball and at the end we came up with the win\u201d He at least finished this game on the court. Porzingis had been ejected in the third quarter of Game 1 with two technical fouls. Winning with Doncic\u2019s fourth-quarter minutes limited due to that foul trouble is the sort of confidence booster the Mavericks needed. \u201cA lot of guys stepped up,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cBoban [Marjanovi\u0107] played great, Trey [Burke] was really good today, Tim [Hardaway Jr.] and a lot of guys stepped up and gave us a lot of energy. Doe Doe [Dorian Finney-Smith] hit some big shots and whenever Luka wasn\u2019t on the court there were a lot of guys that could step up and play well and give us something. \u201cOffense is one thing, but I feel like we made a step forward defensively in terms of our poise throughout the game and those might be even more important than the rest of the stuff. For us as a young team, I feel like we\u2019re heading in the right direction. And this was just a win to show us that we\u2019re capable of doing these things.\u201d They\u2019ve certainly got the Clippers\u2019 attention now, after two tough games. \u201cThey were just looking us in the eye and and taking us off the dribble and playing draw and kick basketball,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. \u201cAnd they played together. They moved the ball, you know, and I thought that stood out. I think at halftime we had seven assists, our starters had two assists at halftime. I think we ended up with four assists from our starters \u2026 that\u2019s not how we\u2019ve played all year. And if we play like that we can\u2019t win.\u201d There were all sort of role reversals in this game. A Mavericks team that sported a 2-11 record in games decided by three points or less during the regular season \u2014 worst in the league \u2014 never let it get that close Wednesday night. The Clippers got the lead down to 10 points in the final four minutes of Game 2, but that was the best they could do. \u201cGive them guys credit, they played hard tonight,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThey\u2019re the reason why we didn\u2019t come back. They knocked down big shots at the right times.\u201d  They did it with and without Doncic in the mix, which was perhaps most telling. Not that Doncic didn\u2019t have yet another brilliant night. He scored 28 points in just 28 minutes, finishing his second playoff game with another milestone. He surpassed Kareem-Abdul Jabbar for second behind George Mikan for the most points scored (70) in his first two playoff games). Doncic\u2019s 42 points in Game 1 broke a 41-year-old for the most points scored in a playoff debut. And he\u2019s the first player to have 70 points, 15 or more rebounds and 15 or more assists in his first two career playoff games. The records are nice, but Doncic said the only thing that matters is the Mavericks getting a win and evening the series at 1-1 with Game 3 on Friday night (9 ET; TNT, TNT OT). He\u2019s as confident now as he was after the Game 1 loss that the Mavericks, like every upset-minded upstart in the bubble, can finish what they\u2019ve started. \u201cIn any series we\u2019re in, we are going to go in believing we can win,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, you\u2019re not supposed to be here. You have to believe it every time.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The All-Star swingman turned in yet another postseason career-high scoring performance Wednesday, lighting up Philadelphia for 33 points in a 128-101 blowout , as Boston seized a 2-0 series lead in the opening round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Tatum became the first 22-year-old Celtic to score 30-plus points in back-to-back playoff games, after dropping 32 in Game 1. Tatum also dove into league annals as the second-youngest player to produce 30 points or more and five-plus assists with no turnovers in the postseason since 1977-78 (when turnovers became an official statistic), according to research from Elias Sports Bureau. And yet, that performance constituted just half the headline: \u201cI thought the difference tonight, though, was our bench really took a game that was not going our way and changed it,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cOur bench was really good tonight.\u201d The statistics show Boston\u2019s bench outscoring Philadelphia\u2019s reserves 24-16. But the reality is the group did so much more toward changing the complexion of the game. Sparked by the efforts of Tatum teamed with reserves, the Celtics turned a 14-point deficit at the end of the first quarter into an eight-point advantage by intermission that continued to swell well into the second half. Joel Embiid carried Philadelphia with 15 points in the first quarter to get the 76ers off to a hot start that turned into a 14-point lead. But with 5:37 remaining in the opening frame, Stevens started sending in the subs, starting with Grant Williams for Daniel Theis, followed by Brad Wanamaker, and later Enes Kanter. That group, with Tatum leading the charge, embarked on a 15-3 run to start the second quarter, followed by an 8-0 run that put Boston ahead by 13 points with 3:42 left in the first half. From the start of the second quarter to the 3:42 mark, Boston outscored Philadelphia 27-8. \u201cOur whole disposition changed when we went to the bench,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI just thought it was much tougher as far as every possession was more challenged. We didn\u2019t start the game well, and they started great. They made every shot, credit them for that. But I just thought from that point on, I never would\u2019ve thought we would\u2019ve stayed with that group in the second quarter for that long, and to their credit, I couldn\u2019t take them out. They were playing great together and turned the game around for us.\u201d Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker combined for 44 points in the first half, while reserves Williams, Wanamaker and Kanter contributed 17. With starting forward Gordon Hayward out due to a Grade 3 right ankle sprain that could sideline him a month, the bench contributions were timely. \u201cWe always pretty much have confidence in our bench,\u201d Walker said. \u201cTonight, they really just came out and showed the world that they\u2019re really good. Those guys can hoop, man. When their names are called, they\u2019re always ready. Grant, Romeo [Langford], two of our rookies were unbelievable tonight. Brad Wanamaker, who is one of our leaders, holding it down on the bench. He was tremendous. Enes, he was great as well. We need those guys big time, and tonight was a perfect example of that.\u201d The onslaught only continued in the second half once the starters returned, as Boston outscored the Philadelphia, 33-18, in the third quarter. \u201cEspecially at the start of that third quarter, they really killed us in transition,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cJust like that, they were up 20.\u201d The question for the Sixers now is where do they go from here down 2-0, missing one of their top players in Ben Simmons, who is out with a knee injury, as the team starves for contributions from players on the roster other than Embiid? Embiid scored a playoff career-high 34 points but mustered just 12 points in the second half. Tobias Harris, meanwhile, has scored 28 points in two games this series on just 30 total field goal attempts, while Al Horford has contributed just 10 points while taking just 10 shots this series. The Sixers are also shooting just 29% from 3-point range through the first two games. It\u2019s clear that Embiid can\u2019t do it all alone. That didn\u2019t stop him from echoing his exact words coming out of the Game 1 loss after this one. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do more,\u201d he said. \u201cThat first quarter, we were great. We moved the ball. We were dominating. We got stops. They just started making stuff tough for us.\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown changed the team\u2019s tactics for Game 2 after gambling on the team\u2019s size in physicality in the series opener, only to be burned along the perimeter by Tatum and Brown. For this game, Brown elected to start Matisse Thybulle, who came off the bench in Game 1 and in spurts limited Tatum to just 4 points (2-9 FGs, 0-for-1 on 3-pointers), while the Celtics forward scored 18 points on 7-for-11 shooting (2-for-4 on 3-pointers) Monday when guarded by Josh Richardson, Harris and Embiid. Thybulle couldn\u2019t slow Tatum this time. Tatum drained 12 of 20 attempts, including 8-of-12 from 3-point range; Walker chipped in 22 points and Jaylen Brown contributed 20. \u201cI think it gets deflating when their shot makers went bananas,\u201d Brett Brown said. \u201cTatum is a handful.\u201d With Philadelphia now sitting in the difficult position of needing to win four out of the next five games \u2014 provided it gets to that \u2014 to win the series, Brown said he believes the team possesses enough talent and character in the locker room to rally from the deficit. \u201cPeople are people,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m sure in the light of day, in the dark of night, you\u2019re gonna start thinking \u2018What do we have to do?\u2019 But I do believe it. I think that there has been enough success, not consistently in the bubble, where you can call upon things without Ben [Simmons] that you can point to that are real. So, it\u2019s up to me to recognize those things, to point them out in a real way to help them get through this. I do believe that the locker room feels they have a hell of a lot more to give.\u201d As for Tatum, he\u2019s got plenty left to contribute, too. But the third-year veteran admits he\u2019s still learning. \u201cI\u2019ve got the utmost confidence in myself, and my teammates, and I know it\u2019s reciprocated,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure it out, trying to figure out when I need to be more aggressive, when I need to make the late pass. I think the most important thing is I want to be that guy. I want to be able to make big plays, whether that\u2019s scoring or making the right pass because I\u2019m drawing attention. I think that\u2019s the first step: wanting to be that person.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

It\u2019s his height, his length, his rim protection. The opponents\u2019 shots Gobert swats, the shots he changes and the ones he discourages completely. It\u2019s not for nothing that Gobert owns the last two Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards, is a finalist to win it again this season and routinely ranks as or among the league\u2019s best in rebounds and blocked shots. The 7-foot-1 Frenchman\u2019s work at one end of the floor overshadows what he gives the Utah Jazz at the other end, but Gobert\u2019s offense was a vital part of his team\u2019s 124-105 victory over Denver in Game 2 on Wednesday. He scored 19 points on 7-for-10 shooting to help the Jazz, seeded No. 6 in the West playoff bracket, even their series at 1-1 with the No. 3 Nuggets. How important were Gobert\u2019s 19 points, besides representing the final margin? A strong case can be made that when this defensive dominator is putting the ball through the net, the Jazz flow better offensively and certainly enjoy more success. Let\u2019s just stick with 19, his output Wednesday: In the 17 games Gobert scored 19 or more during the regular season, Utah went 12-5. That\u2019s clearly a bump from their 30-21 mark when he finished with fewer points. It\u2019s a pattern that holds, too. In 2018-19, the Jazz were 17-5 when their man in the middle reached 19 points, and 9-2 the season before that. That\u2019s a combined 38-12 over three seasons, a .760 winning percentage. Utah\u2019s overall winning percentage since 2017-18 is .601 (142-94). Now 19 isn\u2019t a back-breaking number for a defense to yield, but it\u2019s the result of Gobert staying active, getting to the rim and making himself available for feeds inside and lobs. That\u2019s something no defense can neglect, as the Nuggets were reminded down at the Disney campus Wednesday. Several times, Denver let Gobert leak inside their defense. Or they didn\u2019t properly box him out, freeing him to score or slam back Utah misses. Typical for Gobert, he had three layups and four dunks \u2013 the high-percentage shots that fueled his NBA-best 69.3 FG% this season. Gobert \u2013 a Denver draft pick in 2013 (No. 27) traded that very night to Utah for, er, Erick Green (56 career NBA appearances) and cash \u2013 sticks to what he knows best when the ball is in his hands. In seven seasons, fully 81% of his shots have come within three feet of the rim, and he has made 72.2% of those. No wonder he ranks second all-time in NBA shooting percentage, his 64.0 FG% trailing only DeAndre Jordan\u2019s 66.9%. Nobody else is close. Tyson Chandler ranks third at 59.7%. So really, no attentive fan should be surprised that Gobert has led the league in dunks the past two seasons. He finished last week with 221 between the regular schedule and the bubble games. In 2018-19, Gobert\u2019s 306 set an NBA record, for however long dunks actually have been tracked (I\u2019d bet on Wilt Chamberlain if we had access to all-time stats). By moving and looking for the ball, Gobert scored 10 points in the second quarter of Game 2, picking up slack as Donovan Mitchell managed only two. His dozen points by halftime might have been mentioned in the Denver locker room. And then Utah scored 43 points in the third quarter, made 72 percent of its shots to break open the game \u2013 and Gobert shot 0-for-1. \u201cHis ability to put pressure on the rim is a form of penetration,\u201d Utah coach Quin Snyder said after a game last season. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to account for him, and that draws defenders just the same way dribble penetration does. He\u2019s actually creating offense. We\u2019ve talked about spacing assists when he rolls to the rim.\u201d Gobert\u2019s value out front in Utah\u2019s attack has drawn raves for a long time. No one regularly sets more screens for his shooters. Sure enough, he was credited with 471 screen assists this season, tops in the league. Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis was next with 437 and Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo had 366. Averaging 15.1 points, 13.5 rebounds and 2.0 blocked shots, Gobert won\u2019t outscore his Denver matchup, Nikola Jokic, in this series. The Nuggets\u2019 versatile big already leads in that category, 57-36. But Jokic is expected to \u2014 almost required to \u2014 score for his team to succeed. Gobert can provide a bonus, sneaky in the offensive numbers he posts while remaining in the other guys\u2019 heads due to his defense. Ever more assertive about his scoring skills, Gobert even called out the team early this season when he felt forgotten on offense: \u201cWhen you have a guy that\u2019s [7-foot-1] who can catch the ball and finish under the rim, you have to use it.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Even in a series that pits the defending champion and No. 2 seed with 53 wins against the shorthanded No. 7 seed with 35 wins, there is no script. And Games 1 and 2 of the first-round series between the Toronto Raptors and Brooklyn Nets couldn\u2019t have been any more different. In Game 1 on Monday, the Raptors led wire-to-wire and by as many as 33 points. In Wednesday\u2019s Game 2, Brooklyn jumped out to an early 26-12 lead and was on top for most of the first 40 minutes. But in the fourth quarter, the champs looked more like the champs, figuring things out offensively and using a 19-5 run to take control. The Raptors held on for a 104-99 victory that put them up 2-0 as the series changes court graphics for Games 3 and 4. +22 \u2014 Raptors\u2019 point differential in the restricted area in Game 2. As the Los Angeles Lakers would tell you right now , it\u2019s a make-or-miss league. In Game 1, the Raptors made 22 3s. And in Game 2, there was a lot more missing, as they shot 9-for-35 from beyond the arc. The Nets made a defensive adjustment by switching all screens. This is a team that had, all season, done everything to keep its rim-protecting centers in the paint. Only the Milwaukee Bucks had allowed a lower percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots to come in the restricted area than the Nets (28%). But in the playoffs, teams will abandon what they\u2019ve done all season if the matchup calls for it. The Raptors\u2019 offense relies on ball movement; It ranked third in secondary assists per game and eighth in passes per 24 minutes of possession. And to stifle some of that ball movement, the Nets had Allen do something he\u2019d rarely done in his three seasons in the NBA: switch every screen and defend guards one-on-one. The adjustment worked in the first half as the Raptors scored just 50 points on 52 offensive possessions, settling for a few too many jumpers. They attempted more 3s ( 21 ) than shots in the restricted area ( 17 ) and they got to the line for just 11 free throw attempts in the half. Things changed in the second half. The Raptors scored just four more points in the final 24 minutes (54) than they did in the first 24 (50), but they did it on seven fewer possessions (54 on 45). In the second half, they took took more shots in the restricted area ( 16 ) than they did from 3-point range (10), and they got to the line for 17 attempts. With the additional looks inside, the Game 2 scoring flipped most of the Game 1 numbers: \u201cI think this is a really good example of playoff basketball,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said afterward. \u201cEach game takes a whole different shape. Now I would assume Game 3\u2019s gonna take another one. It\u2019s what makes it so interesting and intriguing, I think. The Raptors aren\u2019t the most complete team in this postseason. But their title run last year put them in a lot of different situations, and they\u2019ve learned they can win in multiple ways. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring things out before the clock expires at the end of the fourth quarter. \u201cI always say there\u2019s a lot of ways to win a game,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cand you just got to find one of them.\u201d When the defense is switching screens, the offense can hunt mismatches, looking to isolate a guard against a slow-footed big or post a big against a small guard. The Raptors did some of that \u2014 \u201cfinding a matchup we could hit to the paint with and then make a good decision, either finish it off or dump it off or kick it out,\u201d according to Nurse \u2014 and they got a late bucket from a Serge Ibaka post-up against Caris LeVert after a switch. But their isolations against Allen mostly came up empty. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Raptors scored just two points on six isolations against Allen (though Pascal Siakam left a couple of points at the line after a foul), with five of those six isos coming prior to the the fourth quarter. In the final 12 minutes, the Raptors just didn\u2019t use many screens, attacking more 1-on-1. \u201cYou do a little more cutting and a lot less setting of screens,\u201d Nurse said of his team\u2019s approach to a switching defense. \u201cThen we just try to stay away from ball screens, too. We tried to run some more off-ball, pin down actions and quite a few set plays. We usually like to play a pretty open concept type offense but tonight we were calling a lot of plays just to move \u2019em around and create a bunch of switches before we attacked the paint.\u201d Here\u2019s a few ways they found success in the fourth quarter: Play 1 The Raptors\u2019 second possession of the fourth lasted 20 seconds, but didn\u2019t include a single screen. They almost lost the ball at one point, but late in the clock, VanVleet was able to get by Caris LeVert, draw help, and dump the ball off for an Ibaka layup. Play 2 Three possessions later, VanVleet waves his teammates to the left side of the floor so he can again go 1-on-1 with LeVert. He blows by the Nets\u2019 bubble star (who\u2019s maybe feeling the toll of the offensive load he\u2019s been carrying) for another layup. Play 3 Ibaka sets a screen for VanVleet, but instead of using it and seeing a switch from Allen, VanVleet rejects the screen and attacks the paint again. Tyler Johnson is able to stay with him and force a miss. Play 4 VanVleet isolates against Johnson at the top of the floor, but makes a quick pitch to OG Anunoby, who attacks the seam created by Allen shading toward VanVleet. LeVert helps from the weak side and commits a foul. After Norman Powell missed a jumper on their first possession of the fourth, the Raptors scored 21 points on their next 11 possessions to turn a six-point deficit into a seven-point lead. They figured out how to attack the Nets\u2019 new defense, and they executed with the game on the line. Wednesday was a day for the Raptors\u2019 coaching staff to earn their paychecks. They have an experienced, veteran core of players that don\u2019t necessarily need a lot of guidance from night-to-night. But with Game 2 being much more of a slog than Game 1, and with the Nets\u2019 adjustments working well, the players needed some input from the sidelines. \u201cThere\u2019s games where they defer way more to the coaching staff than other games,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cSome nights, they got a lot of suggestions and a lot of answers and they want to do this and that because they\u2019re on the floor doing it. And there\u2019s some nights where everything seems to be going wrong and they\u2019re like \u2018You guys gotta help us man, what the hell are you doing over here?\u2019 \u201cSo they\u2019re good at kind of being on both of those things. Tonight was really way more about gutting it out, there was a lot of matchup changing, coverage changing, that kind of stuff. \u201cWe really had to hang in there, we were getting hit around pretty hard, they were trying to deliver a knockout punch to us and we just kinda hung in long enough to keep fighting and gut it out.\u201d Nurse says we should expect something different in Game 3 on Friday ( 1:30 ET, NBA TV ), so let\u2019s expect something different. We did see a few possessions of 3-2 zone in the third quarter from Toronto on Wednesday, and maybe we see more of that going forward. The Nets need to get LeVert all the way to the basket more than than they did in Game 2, when he shot 5-for-22, with only one of those 22 shots coming in the restricted area. Maybe they take a page from the Raptors\u2019 book, forgo sending LeVert a screen, and let him isolate with more space. After a brutal outing from Rodions Kurucs (only matched by that of Marc Gasol), we could see another rotation change from the Nets, who put Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot in the starting lineup and only played eight guys on Wednesday. Brooklyn will likely be without Joe Harris, who left Orlando after Game 2 to attend to a personal matter. The Raptors won\u2019t get complacent, and should have another offensive wrinkle or two if Brooklyn continues to switch screens as liberally as it did on Wednesday. In the words of the likely Coach of the Year, it\u2019s what makes it so interesting and intriguing. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Nobody invited Denzel Washington \u2014 well, actually, he didn\u2019t really need one. We were thrilled when one of the great actors of our time chose to spend 15 minutes with us media people, who as you know are not particularly loved by anyone. Washington came to chat, about basketball of course, and he couldn\u2019t have been more down to Earth, gracious and well-versed about the game. He\u2019s been a fixture at Lakers games for decades, and his two seats (one for Paulette, his wife) is just a bounce pass from press row. That means occasionally we get the Denzel nod every now and then. This time, we got an audience, and he seemed just as happy to see us as we were to see him. I thought of this interaction today because I miss the fans. These games at Disney are high-quality and amazing to watch. How can you not be moved by Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell and Luka Doncic, among others? When Ja Morant of the now-departed Memphis Grizzlies took a lob pass and elevated into the clouds for a dunk in the Play-In game with Portland, normally that would cause an eruption at the FedexForum in Memphis \u2014 and even a gasp at a road game. Here? Crickets, except for the Memphis bench. The fans make the playoff atmosphere. Not only do they energize the players, their enthusiasm and presence also reaches to us reporters. Our creativity and motivation to write our stories comes from what we see and hear and, mainly, what we feel. Again, taking nothing away from what these players are doing right now \u2014 truly entertaining performances and finishes \u2014 but the absence of fans, especially after a big moment, is noticeable. Sure, it\u2019s great to speak with the rich and famous. In addition to Washington, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have basketball relationships with Spike Lee, Chris Rock and a few others over the years. But mostly it\u2019s the real fans, the ones who bleed their team colors and devote a large portion of their disposable income for tickets, who resonate mainly with me. I\u2019ve come to know dozens, or at least see them often, in their regular seats, which aren\u2019t as good as Denzel\u2019s. As Pat Beverley is fond of saying, we\u2019re here for the people in the back. I\u2019ve never been more moved by fans than during the days immediately following Kobe Bryant\u2019s death. Their pain was heartfelt. It was almost as if a family member died. They arrived by the thousands outside Staples Center to grieve. Those are devoted, passionate people who care about their sport and the players who grab their attention. The coronavirus pandemic won\u2019t last forever. It won\u2019t deny the fans the chance to reconnect with basketball, and it won\u2019t deprive the players and media the chance to reconnect with the people who pay the salaries, read the stories and truly make this sport work. Maybe next season we\u2019ll have normalcy. I know the NBA is placing a high priority on having games with fans, with safety protocols of course, if that\u2019s possible. Watching Lillard swish buckets from 30 feet here at Disney is fun and sensational. Meanwhile, clear across the country, the Moda Center in Portland is so dark, empty and quiet you can hear a 3-pointer drop. I feel you, Blazers fans. Hopefully soon, I\u2019ll see you, too. And when we connect, the next cup of coffee\u2019s on me. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The clash between the deputy and Ujiri happened as the deputy checked court-access credentials after Toronto\u2019s Game 6 win against Golden State. In body cam footage from a security guard released Tuesday, Alameda, Calif., deputy Alan Strickland shoves Ujiri twice as he attempts to join the team\u2019s championship celebration. In a roughly 2-minute long video posted by KTVU-TV in Oakland, Strickland is seen shoving Ujiri and is heard telling him to \u201cback the [expletive] up.\u201d Ujiri, who had shown his credential, was putting them back in his jacket pocket, says after the shove, \u201cwhy did you push me? I\u2019m the president of the Raptors.\u201d The two men were eventually separated and Ujiri got onto the court. \u201cWe are mindful this remains before the courts, but we have always maintained that the claims made against Masai are baseless and entirely without merit,\u201d a Raptors spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday night, per the the Toronto Star . \u201cWe believe this video evidence shows exactly that \u2014 Masai was not an aggressor but instead was the recipient of two very violent, unwarranted actions. The events of that evening cast a pall over what should have been a night of celebration, and the year since. \u201cWhile Masai has the full backing of Raptors and MLSE [Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment] as he fights this injustice, we are aware that not all people have similar support and resources. This is a spurious legal action that MLSE, the NBA, and especially Masai should not be facing.\u201d Strickland\u2019s filed a suit in February and alleges Ujiri assaulted him and that Strickland suffered \u201cinjury to his body, health, strength, activity and person, all of which have caused and continue to cause Plaintiff great mental, emotional, psychological, physical, and nervous pain and suffering.\u201d Per ESPN , Ujiri filed a countersuit \u2014 which includes the Raptors, NBA and MLSE as plantiffs \u2014 says Strickland falsified their encounter to paint Ujiri as the \u201cinitial agressor\u201d and calls Strickland\u2019s account of the event \u201ca complete fabrication.\u201d Strickland also filed a federal lawsuit against Ujiri as well as a workers\u2019 compensation claim, the Toronto Star reports, but neither of those suits were found to be true. Authorities said in June of 2019 that Ujiri tried to walk past the deputy but the deputy stopped him because he didn\u2019t see Ujiri\u2019s on-court credentials. Ujiri pushed the deputy, who pushed him back before Ujiri \u201cmade a second, more significant shove and during that shove his arm struck our deputy in the side of the head,\u201d sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly said last June. He also said Ujiri also shouted obscenities. Several bystanders intervened and Ujiri got onto the court without displaying any credentials, Kelly said. Warriors fan Greg Wiener, who witnessed the altercation, told The Associated Press in mid-June that the incident began when the deputy put his hand on Ujiri\u2019s chest and pushed him. Ujiri shoved him back before bystanders intervened, Wiener said. He also said then that there was no conversation between the deputy and Ujiri. But on Tuesday, he said he remembered the officer shouting, \u201cNo one gets on the court without credentials.\u201d Ujiri has served as president of the Raptors since May 31, 2013.

Prior to the season hiatus in March, the Lakers scored fewer than 93 points per 100 possessions just once, a 108-91 loss in Philadelphia . In their nine games since the restart, the Lakers have scored fewer than 93 points per 100 possessions four times . Occasion number four \u2014 93 points on 102 offensive possessions \u2014 was Game 1 of their first-round series against the Blazers on Tuesday, a 100-93 defeat that has put the No. 1-seeded Lakers in a 1-0 hole. The L.A. offense was ugly early and, with the game on the line, ugly late. The Blazers had the had the league\u2019s worst defense (by a healthy margin) after Christmas (and ranked 20th of 22 teams in the seeding games), and now they have the No. 1 defense in the playoffs with every series having played a game. 9-for-54 \u2014 The Lakers\u2019 shooting from outside the restricted area in Game 1. That\u2019s 17% shooting on looks that weren\u2019t layups or dunks. LeBron James was involved in the struggle, shooting 1-for-6 from outside the restricted area. But at least 13 of his 19 shots were at the basket, and James added 17 rebounds and 16 assists ( his career playoff high ) to his 23 points. His teammates shot just as poorly away from the basket without the same overall contributions. Guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green and Alex Caruso combined to shoot 2-for-16 from 3-point range. Anthony Davis got to the line for 17 free throw attempts, but only eight of his 23 shots from the field were in the restricted area, and he shot 2-for-15 outside it . This isn\u2019t a new issue. In the regular season, the Lakers ranked first in field goal percentage in the restricted area (69.0%) and 24th in field goal percentage outside it (36.0%). That was the biggest differential in the league. But over their eight seeding games, that differential ( 67.6% vs 30.5% ) was even wider than it was prior. Tuesday marked the Lakers\u2019 worst shooting game from outside the restricted area this season. When the Blazers ranked 20th defensively in the seeding games, their opponents\u2019 shooting from the outside was a much bigger issue than their rim protection. For the season, Portland ranked third in opponent field goal percentage in the paint, but 29th in opponent effective field goal percentage on shots from the outside. The Blazers will leave shooters open, but against the Lakers (at least so far), that\u2019s not necessarily an issue. \u201cWe created a lot of great looks,\u201d James said after the loss. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t able to make \u2019em fall.\u201d James\u2019 one make from outside the paint, a 3-pointer off a dribble hand-off from Dwight Howard , gave the Lakers a six-point lead with a little more than seven minutes to go. From there, L.A. would score just once on its next 10 possessions as Portland went on a 14-2 run to take a six-point lead that it wouldn\u2019t give up. While Damian Lillard was draining 3-pointers from 29 and 35 feet out , the Lakers\u2019 only score in that stretch was a Green layup off a turnover in the backcourt. The first empty possession was an offensive foul on Dwight Howard holding off Hassan Whiteside at the elbow. Two others were trips to the line were Davis and James each went 0-for-2. Green missed a wide-open corner 3-pointer in transition when the Blazers got in front of James. On three critical possessions, though, the Lakers couldn\u2019t get into a packed paint\u2026 Here are three trips down the floor from that 10-possession stretch where the Lakers couldn\u2019t get to the basket and came up empty \u2026 Play 1. James gives the ball to Alex Caruso for a side pick-and-roll (with an empty corner) that worked for a Caruso dunk in the first quarter. On that first quarter play, James\u2019 pick got a piece of Damian Lillard, who went under the screen, but didn\u2019t get to the other side quickly enough to beat Caruso to the spot. This time, Carmelo Anthony gives CJ McCollum plenty of space to go under the screen on Caruso (who made just 16 pull-up jumpers all season), Wenyen Gabriel also pinches in from the weak side to stop the drive, and the weak side isn\u2019t spaced as well (Green is creeping inside the arc). Caruso kicks to Davis, who has now missed his last 13 3-point attempts. Play 2. James runs a pick-and-roll with Howard, but doesn\u2019t drive against Hassan Whiteside\u2019s drop coverage. Whiteside has to eventually leave the paint, prompting Gabriel to sink far off Davis on the left wing to help with Howard. James kicks the ball out to Davis, who has plenty of time and space to shoot before Gabriel closes out. But he passes up the open look (having missed 13 straight 3-pointers), hesitates before driving, and can\u2019t get all the way to the basket. His running hook isn\u2019t his worst shot of the night, but there\u2019s a big difference between Davis in the restricted area ( 73.5% this season ) and Davis elsewhere in the paint (40.1%). Play 3. Davis sets a drag screen for James to get to the middle of the floor. With Gary Trent Jr. trailing the screen and James engaging Whiteside, Lillard sinks into the paint to help on Davis\u2019 roll to the rim. With an additional shooter (and no Howard) in the game, the floor is properly spaced, but Lillard is able to get back to the corner to run Kentavious Caldwell-Pope off the line. KCP gets by the close-out, but drives into a crowd and gets his shot blocked by Whiteside. The Blazers will obviously do their best keep the paint crowded and make the Lakers beat them from the outside in Game 2 on Thursday ( 9 p.m. ET, ESPN ). L.A. could play Davis more at the five, so that he has more opportunities to post up or roll to the rim without Howard or JaVale McGee there already. In Game 1, Davis played a little more than half of his minutes at center (with both Howard and McGee on the bench), and the Lakers were a little better offensively in those minutes (40 points scored on 45 offensive possessions) than they were with Davis at the four (31 on 39). The Lakers will certainly try to run more. They can be relentless in transition , but they registered just 15 fast break points on Tuesday (below their season average of 18.4 ), despite holding Portland under a point per possession and forcing more live-ball turnovers (11) than any team averaged this season. With the league\u2019s third-ranked defense in the regular season, the Lakers can certainly win ugly. But they can\u2019t win 16 times over the next two months with their offense as ugly as it\u2019s been over the last three weeks. At some point, they must score more frequently. \u201cWe just got to make shots,\u201d Davis offered after the loss, \u201cbe confident in our process and our work.\u201d Asked if the Lakers might be close to finding their rhythm, James couldn\u2019t offer any assurances. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you play the game the right way, make the extra pass, shoot the shots that are there, try to create two on the basketball and you got numbers on the back end on four on three\u2026\u201d The defensive game plan for the Lakers\u2019 opponents was always going to prioritize protecting the paint, making James and Davis shoot from the outside as much as possible, and forcing the supporting cast to carry some of the offensive load. L.A. had the best record in the Western Conference, but didn\u2019t come to Orlando without an issue or two. We just didn\u2019t expect one of those issues to look more like a fatal flaw so early in the postseason. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Sidelined with a strained right quadriceps muscle, Westbrook underwent an MRI before the team\u2019s win over Oklahoma City. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni declined to place a definitive timeline on the nine-time All-Star\u2019s potential return to the lineup. D\u2019Antoni said that although Westbrook\u2019s injury \u201cis healing\u201d the team \u201ccan\u2019t rule anything out, but don\u2019t rule anything in\u201d regarding his status. Based on Houston\u2019s sharp performance in a game more lopsided than the final score seemed to indicate, perhaps the Rockets can afford to take their time with bringing back Westbrook. These teams faced one another Tuesday for the first-time since Houston committed to its current small-ball style of play, and it became apparent from the outset that Oklahoma City wasn\u2019t ready. James Harden posted his 20th career playoff game with 35 points or more (37), and the Rockets cruised on the strength of contributions from less-heralded players such as Jeff Green (22 points) and Eric Gordon (21 points). \u201cIt\u2019s a different team,\u201d Thunder point guard Chris Paul said. \u201cYou play a certain way the whole season, and then you\u2019ve got a team that switches everything. It\u2019s Game 1. We\u2019ve got to figure it out. That\u2019s why they are who they are. They play totally different than any other team in the league.\u201d Here are five observations from Game 1: Gordon joined Houston\u2019s starting lineup for Game 1 and provided most of the same elements the Rockets have come to expect from Westbrook, except with a more consistent jump shot, in leading a first-half onslaught. \u201cEric Gordon is like a wildcard for them because Gordy is so tough [with] his ability to shoot deep, his ability to drive,\u201d Paul said. Gordon racked up 14 of his 21 points in the second quarter alone, hitting his only 3-point attempt of the quarter, while wreaking havoc with drives to the basket off the dribble in helping Houston build a 21-point lead. Gordon led the Rockets in scoring (16 points) at halftime. \u201cEric is more than capable,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most skilled guys that we have in this league. He\u2019s able to beat his guy off the bounce, create opportunities for his teammates and shoot the 3 at a high level.\u201d Gordon\u2019s Game 1 performance marked the first time since the beginning of the season that he\u2019s appeared to be fully healthy. Gordon fought through a knee injury that required surgery in November, before suffering a sprained left ankle during a restart scrimmage in the NBA bubble, just days before Houston played its first seeding game. He\u2019s \u201cfinally getting his swag and his rhythm back,\u201d according to Harden. \u201cIt\u2019s all about playmaking,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to attack the rim or even knock down shots. That\u2019s the great thing about my game: I can always attack the rim, I can always get off the 3, and I can always penetrate and kick to someone else.\u201d It definitely gave Oklahoma City plenty of problems, especially in the first half as the Thunder shot 40.5% with playmakers Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder combining to connect on just 5 of 19 from the field. Houston\u2019s half-court defense switched on everything with crisp rotations that consistently prevented Paul and the other scorers from getting to their spots on the floor, which forced Oklahoma City\u2019s offense to become stagnate most of the game. \u201cI thought they did a really good job of keeping [Gilgeous-Alexander and Schroder] out of the lane,\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cI think you started to see Chris [Paul] do it a little bit later in the game. There are times the ball is coming to those guys, and they\u2019ve got to shoot the ball. There are times where they\u2019re off of those guys, and those guys are gonna have to rise up and shoot. They\u2019re good shooters. If they\u2019re open, they need to take those shots. They were trying to get downhill as much as they could. Listen, the faster we play, the more it helps those guys. The slower we get, the more it\u2019s a little bit of a challenge for us. They\u2019re a physical, strong team. When you get caught up in the half court, those guys getting in there against that contact, it\u2019s tough to finish. But if you can get the ball ahead of their defense, and those guys can get their speed and quickness involved, they\u2019ll be better off if we can play faster. That\u2019s gonna be a key for us is can we play faster?\u201d Oklahoma City committed 13 turnovers for 19 Houston points, and the Rockets outscored the Thunder 13-2 on the break. \u201cSince we\u2019re undersized, we have to be flying around,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cOnce we play with that intensity, the speed that we were playing with makes it tough on teams. If they catch you on the ropes, they\u2019re gonna pound you. It was great defense.\u201d Donovan might need to find more minutes for his closing lineup of Paul, Schroder, Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari and Steven Adams, which finished the regular season with a net rating of 29.9, good for tops in the league for any five-man lineup playing together at least 100 minutes. Donovan utilized the group when Oklahoma City fell behind 21 points in the second quarter, and it helped the Thunder trim the deficit to just 11 points in a span of 2:36. OKC\u2019s bench entered the playoffs having outscored or tied opponents\u2019 reserves in 49 of the team\u2019s 72 games during the regular season, helping the Thunder to a record of 33-16 under those circumstances. In fact, the Thunder bench limited opposing reserves during the regular season to the lowest scoring average (34.6) in the NBA while tying for first in blocks (181). Houston busted up all those stats with a dominating performance in Game 1. The Rockets reserves, led by Green (handling the ball in a point forward role) and Ben McClemore (14 points on 4 of 7 from deep), outscored Oklahoma City\u2019s bench 42-27. What\u2019s scarier is that Gordon could move to the bench this series if Westbrook is deemed healthy enough at some point to play. \u201cWhen Russell gets back, we\u2019ll have an even deeper bench,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cBen\u2019s been playing well only since the first of the year. He\u2019s played well all year. Then, you\u2019ve got Jeff [Green] and Austin [Rivers]. So, if you add somebody back to the bench \u2026 our bench is good. It\u2019s just trying to get everybody healthy and everybody playing at the same time.\u201d NBA.com colleague John Schuhmann pointed out coming into this series that no Western Conference team had limited Houston to fewer points per 100 possessions in the regular season than the Thunder (102.9). The Rockets shot worse than 30% from 3-point range in the three regular-season meetings, losing twice. But that was before Houston\u2019s all-in commitment to small ball, which D\u2019Antoni quickly noted. \u201cYou know we have a different team, right? That\u2019s the biggest thing,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe just are a completely different team, and it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen us. So, they\u2019ll make their adjustments. I don\u2019t expect it to be easy by any means.\u201d Luguentz Dort played a role in guarding Harden in the third regular season meeting between the teams, but he sat out Tuesday due to a sprained right knee. Donovan experimented some in the first half of Game 1 by playing defensive stopper Andre Roberson against Harden, due to the former\u2019s extensive experience against the 2018 MVP. Once considered an elite defender, Roberson is still getting acclimated after missing 2 \u00bd years of basketball due to a devastating left knee injury. He played nearly 3 \u00bd minutes in Game 1. \u201cI wanted to take a look at Andre to see what it would be like guarding James Harden because he certainly has a history of playing him and knows him very well,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI think it was important sooner than later to find out what that would look like.\u201d Paul admitted that Game 1 served as somewhat of a feeling-out process for Oklahoma City. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily probably play fast enough, downhill,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s Game 1. We\u2019ve got to feel it out. [It\u2019s] the first team all season we\u2019ve played like that. So, we knew it was sort of a feel-out game. Stay with it, one game at a time. Each game, we\u2019re gonna learn something about them. They\u2019re gonna learn something about us.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

This is why rivals in the Eastern Conference can stride purposefully toward a meeting in the conference semis or finals without knees knocking, and why other coaches might not sweat out major adjustments or some new wrinkle by the Milwaukee Bucks. This is how you don\u2019t \u201c register much on the national thrill scale \u201d and wind up going head-to-head with soap operas and \u201cMatlock\u201d reruns at playoff time. The Bucks\u2019 embarrassing performance Tuesday in their 122-110 defeat by the Orlando Magic in Game 1 of their first-round series at the Disney campus in central Florida wasn\u2019t some fluke or momentary misstep. It was a snapshot of who and what their team is right now. Which is a far cry from who the Bucks were for most of the not forgotten-but-gone 2019-20 regular season. And, while we\u2019re at it, for the season before that and change. Milwaukee and its fans can say it\u2019s only one game. They can claim that the Bucks\u2019 superior talent, size and experience will assert itself four times, quickly and completely, before this is over. They might be correct, too, since No. 1 seeds rarely lose series against No. 8 seeds. (For the record, it has happened just five out of a possible 72 times since the league\u2019s current format was set in 1984). Still, the Bucks face the task now of winning four of six, something they haven\u2019t done since early March. And that\u2019s more than a calendar trick based on the NBA\u2019s pandemic shutdown. Giannis Antetokounmpo, coach Mike Budenholzer and the rest were 52-8 on March 1, halfway through a set of back-to-back games that wrapped in Miami. Since then, starting with a 16-point loss to the Heat, they have gone 4-10. That includes a 3-5 mark in the bubble\u2019s seeding games, plus Tuesday\u2019s stunningly bad showing against the Magic. And no, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Orlando getting to play, ahem, in\/near Orlando. Nobody has home games in this year\u2019s bracket, no matter how desperately the league\u2019s No. 1 overall seed appeared to need one. That was even the theme of some in-arena and Zoom questions afterward. Were the Bucks suffering from not being able to play the first two games of the series back at Fiserv Forum, the friendly confines where they went 28-3 before the shutdown? Wisely, while answering politely, none of them fully took the bait on a topic that every team and player in the bubble could use as an excuse. No need for further embarrassment. Forty-eight minutes was enough. Milwaukee fell behind by 10 points in the first quarter and 18 in the second. Its biggest lead: 8-2. It trailed for roughly the final 40 minutes, each narrowing of the gap followed by a miss, a defensive lapse or a turnover, Orlando separating again and again. In short, the Magic did to the Bucks what the Bucks were expected to do and should have done to the Magic. And anyone who has been paying attention to Milwaukee\u2019s meandering ways of late was surprised only by how little the body twitched when kicked. \u201cI don\u2019t think our group underestimated Orlando,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very good team. They\u2019re very well-coached. They\u2019ve got a lot of good players. They\u2019ve got weapons.\u201d Coach-ese aside, along with the fact that the guy on the Magic bench, Steve Clifford, is aces at his job, if Orlando had that many weapons, it would not have shown up for the playoffs with a 32-39 record. It at least would have passed the undermanned Nets for the No. 7 seed the previous two weeks. It\u2019s important to credit Orlando for what it do so well Tuesday. From Nikola Vucevic\u2019s All-Star production as a inside-outside threat who bedeviled Bucks center Brook Lopez to Gary Clark\u2019s surprise work as a Giannis defender chipping in 15 points. The Magic even thrived with Evan Fournier, normally their second-leading scorer, getting shut out until the final minutes, the outcome decided. But let\u2019s face it, when a presumed title contender falls on its face like this to start its postseason, the loser gets the attention. Not that this is news by the classic definition \u2013 Milwaukee has now dropped five consecutive playoff games, dating back to its elimination by Toronto 15 months ago. Fact is, that delayed sweep (after the Bucks led the Raptors 2-0 in the East finals) haunts Milwaukee as a turning point. Opponents and fans saw things in what Toronto and coach Nick Nurse took away from Antetokounmpo in winning those four games. How the Bucks seemingly took their medicine without altering too much. How throwing up a wall in front of the Greek Freak dared the others to beat you, and how they didn\u2019t. Going 116-39 the past two seasons is starting to feel like a parlor trick with no staying power. We\u2019ve seen it before from team\u2019s with unique talents or styles, and the Bucks with Antetokounmpo and dare-them-to-miss drop defense certainly qualify as that. Charles Barkley talked about it on the Inside the NBA TNT set, that Milwaukee can run up a gaudy record when facing teams randomly in December, January and February. That changes in the playoffs, where the opponents are good and coaches lock in over five, six or seven games. OK, so the Michael Jordan Bulls never got solved while running that triangle attack year after year. But remember George Karl\u2019s Seattle teams, with what back then was a novel switching defense? Or the recent Houston teams, so James Harden-centric? The unusual becomes usual, then beatable. What we witnessed in Game 1 wasn\u2019t the Bucks underestimating Orlando. But it could have been the Bucks overestimating themselves. Antetokounmpo with his heavy usage got to impressive numbers (31 points, 17 rebounds, seven assists) but Vucevic essentially canceled him out and what was left mostly was not good. The recurring stories the past two years about Khris Middleton being a worthy sidekick for Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe being a borderline third All-Star, look, they need to stop. Those two and Lopez combined for just 34 points on 11-for-32 shooting. When Markelle Fultz in only his fourth playoff game and first start keeps up with Bledsoe, his Bucks counterpart, the repeat postseason disappointment (against Boston in 2018, against Toronto last year) isn\u2019t panning out as planned. As for Middleton, his up-and-down playoff production \u2013 he has scored 11, 12, 9, 30, 6, 14 and 14 points in his last six tests, shooting 40% \u2013 he\u2019s been more Batgirl than Robin, showing up to help only occasionally. The Bucks got outshot across the board, field goals, 3-pointers and free throws. They coughed up 25 points on their 16 turnovers. And their lauded defense, No. 1 in the regular season, got shot over by Magic starters from the arc at a 44%rate (15-for-34). The Magic didn\u2019t have Aaron Gordon, Jonathan Isaac or Michael Carter-Williams and it didn\u2019t matter. That No. 1 in \u2018D\u2019 rating meant as much Tuesday as the seeding. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling,\u201d veteran guard George Hill said, acknowledging that the Bucks\u2019 mojo or Bango or whatever is off. They might advance in spite of this showing, but does anyone think Jimmy Butler and the Heat (if Miami advances, too) will be fretting about facing the Bucks in the next round? Antetokounmpo had talked last week about the Bucks getting overlooked in TV scheduling, tipoff times and NBA fans\u2019 conversations about the elite teams. Congratulations to them, then, because now they\u2019re in position to turn that to their advantage. By getting underestimated by Orlando. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The NBA has done everything possible to prevent the intrusion of a virus and is clearly winning that contest in a blowout. Meanwhile, there is no defense against the nature of sports, which is why Russell Westbrook was a scratch Tuesday from the Rockets-Thunder opener and the Celtics-Sixers series became further damaged when Gordon Hayward joined Ben Simmons on the shelf. All three of those injuries happened here in Orlando, and that\u2019s either a coincidence or a byproduct of a season that took a four-month hiatus. The bigger issue is how those injuries are affecting those teams, both now and in the next rounds if any are fortunate to survive and move on. The latest was Hayward, who took a nasty spill out of bounds Monday and limped off the floor with what was later diagnosed as a Grade 3 right ankle sprain and is estimated to be out about 4 weeks. His time off might be extended because Hayward\u2019s wife is expecting their fourth child and is due next month. \u201cTo see the agony on his face after he fell, I was terrified,\u201d said Celtics guard Marcus Smart. \u201cI thought it was the same ankle that he hurt last time \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t. Now we lose one of our guys. It\u2019s tough to see anybody go down especially when you\u2019re someone who\u2019s playing great basketball and the team needs you.\u201d Four weeks would be the start of the Eastern Conference finals; at the very least, Hayward will miss the Philly series and the next if Boston advances. The injury is a reflection of Hayward\u2019s time in Boston. Following a serious broken ankle injury that cost him a year, Hayward broke his hand last November. That benched him for a month, yet Hayward played consistently well right until the pandemic halted the schedule. And now, this. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough for him, obviously tough for us, too,\u201d said coach Brad Stevens. \u201cHe\u2019s played really well. It\u2019s one of those freak things that happen in basketball all the time. It\u2019s our job to make up for all the great things he does. \u201cHe\u2019s bummed as you can imagine. He put in a lot of time and effort. We\u2019ve been fortunate in the bubble about injuries and then the playoffs start and now this. We\u2019ve lived this before and we\u2019re going to have to have other people step up.\u201d The Celtics are among the more deeper teams and can survive this better than others, but only if Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown stay on a consistently high level. The two young swingmen combined for 61 points and played solid defense in the Celtics\u2019 Game 1 win, and Boston is seeing the benefits of their developing chemistry, which took a leap before the season was halted. That\u2019s a tough matchup for anyone because both players have similar skills, move well without the ball and can create their own shots. The Celtics feel comfortable with either player taking big fourth-quarter shots, giving the club a touch of unpredictability and flexibility in close games. This is especially heightened against the Sixers, who are without Simmons because of a knee injury suffered during the seeded portion of the restart schedule. Simmons will likely make the All-Defensive team because of his 6-10 height, quick hands and an equal ability to protect the perimeter and the rim. He can also disrupt passing lanes and did a credible job against Tatum this season. \u201cEven without Ben we have a team that\u2019s capable,\u201d said coach Brett Brown. \u201cBen\u2019s demise is punishing. What it means is you\u2019ve got to go down to other players. It leads into a lot of other things, the group effort and the game plan\u2019s got to be precise. You don\u2019t have the wiggle room of a misstep or a mistake. I see it that simply. That\u2019s how I see the lack of having Ben.\u201d The Sixers clearly suffered Monday without Simmons, and therefore this playoffs series, which traditionally ranks among the NBA\u2019s best over multiple decades, loses luster and likely suspense as well, even if Joel Embiid is the best player on the floor. \u201cI still like the spirit of the group,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI believe we have enough depth and talent to do great things in the playoffs. We\u2019re very reliant on a togetherness, on Joel, on a well executed game plan.\u201d The Rockets are in a better place with Westbrook, whose quad injury isn\u2019t playoff-threatening. He sat Tuesday\u2019s game and isn\u2019t projected to rejoin the Rockets until Game 3 at the latest. That\u2019s a temporary inconvenience for the Rockets in what should be a tight matchup with Oklahoma City, Westbrook\u2019s former team. It places a heavier load on the rotational players who support James Harden; suddenly, those players might be forced to take big shots when Harden draws double-teams, and Westbrook\u2019s work on the glass must also be replaced. \u201cWe all know how much he means to us,\u201d said Harden. \u201cWe feel confident we can get production from others until he gets back.\u201d No matter where the series stands, once he heals they\u2019ll obviously welcome him back. Westbrook came into the restart riding his finest stretch with the Rockets, averaging 30 points, eight rebounds and seven assists between January through March. Meanwhile, the Pacers are also playing without a crucial starter; Domantas Sabonis left Orlando shortly after he arrived to treat plantar fasciitis and is out. Much like Sixers-Celtics, the Pacers\u2019 matchup with the Heat was evenly-matched before his injury. Without him, and after Victor Oladipo was lost midway through the game with an eye injury, the Pacers had few late-game options against Jimmy Butler and Miami and lost as a result. Then again, the Magic shocked the top-seeded Bucks with Aaron Gordon out with a sore hamstring and Jonathan Isaac done for the playoffs following knee surgery. For the short-term, Orlando managed quite well. Yet the playoffs are a marathon, even on a neutral floor, and the journey seems even longer for teams with major missing pieces. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

"},{"id":26361,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/butler-takes-responsibility-heat-game-1","date":"2020-08-19","title":"Jimmy Butler takes responsibility for Heat in Game 1","content":" Sometimes the numbers lie. Or they don\u2019t tell the whole truth. The analytics say you don\u2019t want a player who\u2019s shooting 24 percent from the 3-point line to keep firing away from deep to close out a playoff game. Jimmy Butler doesn\u2019t give a \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say he\u2019s not interested in what you or your numbers say. So when he saw an opportunity to put the Indiana Pacers away down the stretch Tuesday, he rose up twice, on back-to-back possessions, and drained backbreaking 3s to provide the separation the Heat needed in their 113-101 Game 1 win over the Pacers. \u201cI take what the game gives me a majority of the time,\u201dButler said. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll force it and take some bad shots. But in the end, my teammates and my coach was like, \u2018Don\u2019t lose this game. Win it for us.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I was thinking: make the right play. And on those two possessions, it was a pull up 3.\u201d That\u2019s the beauty of Butler\u2019s game, and more importantly Butler\u2019s attitude. He doesn\u2019t mind going against the grain, no matter how crazy it might look to someone else. It\u2019s an attitude that hasn\u2019t always served him well in previous stops, where his competitive nature was misinterpreted as something else. But it\u2019s worked all season in Miami, with a Heat team that needed an agitator and leader, someone willing to step into that space Butler has occupied all season, and certainly since the Heat showed up in Orlando for the restart of this NBA season. Butler said he\u2019s not interested in fraternizing with anyone outside of the Heat camp at Walt Disney World, not with designs on \u201cwinning it all,\u201d as he declared in an ESPN interview last week. That fearlessness fueled the Heat\u2019s fire in Game 1. That\u2019s exactly the way the Heat like it. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to put himself out there. Make or miss, he wants the responsibility,\u201d said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously why we sought him out so fervently (in free agency last summer).\u201d It\u2019s also why his teammates had no doubt that he\u2019d come through the way he did with the game on the line, never mind what the numbers said. \u201cI yell at him all the time to shoot the ball,\u201d Heat All-Star big man Bam Adebayo said. \u201cLike, \u2018Shoot the ball, shoot the ball.\u2019 And tonight it just clicked, where he listened to me. And made two big 3s. You know, I\u2019m proud of him. And we need him to keep that same fire and desire in his eyes the he had today and just keep going.\u201d No one has to worry about Butler\u2019s motor. He finds motivation in every slight, perceived and otherwise. And as long as Indiana\u2019s T.J. Warren is on the other side, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem in this series. Butler took the challenge on both ends, rekindling their rivalry while maintaining his focus and composure when it mattered most. He finished with a game-high 28 points and that perfect 2-for-2 effort from beyond the 3-point line. \u201cHe\u2019s the head of the snake over there,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said of Butler. \u201cHe runs that team offensively, does a god job of initiating the offense, setting guys up as well as scoring. Tonight we did a pretty good job on their other guys and he started scoring. He draws the assignment of defending your best guy and he was on Warren tonight. He established how they play over there.\u201d Butler didn\u2019t have to do the heavy lifting alone. Not with veteran point guard Goran Dragic taking his turns making plays during a critical 22-8 fourth quarter blitz, when the Pacers simply couldn\u2019t match the Heat veterans\u2019 clutch playmaking. Dragic piloted the offense brilliantly in place of rookie starter Kendrick Nunn, who was healthy and available but did not play. He scored 21 of his 24 points in the second half, 14 in the fourth quarter, as the Heat committed just one turnover after halftime. But this Heat crew, playing its first playoff game together, looked extremely comfortable in the roles they\u2019ll be asked to play. Butler and Adebayo (17 points, 10 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 blocks) looked like All-Stars. Dragic was every bit the seasoned vet he is and even rookie Tyler Herro popped (15 points, 4 assists) in his postseason debut. \u201cI love it,\u201d Butler said. \u201cGoran was stinky in the first half, too. He admitted it to me. But he came out in the second half killing, being the Dragon (Dragic\u2019s nickname) we need him to be. Tyler has been phenomenal all year long. And we all know what Bam brings to the table. I\u2019ve said this over and over again, Bam is the heart and soul behind this team. When he\u2019s playing at a high level, it\u2019s going to be tough for anybody to beat us.\u201d The same could be said about Butler, especially on Tuesday. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Hayward was diagnosed with a Grade 3 right ankle sprain and will be out approximately four weeks, the team said Tuesday. The injury occurred while jumping in a crowd for a rebound with just over three minutes remaining and Hayward\u2019s foot came down on teammate Daniel Theis\u2019 left foot. The timeline for recovery means Hayward will miss the rest of the first round at a minimum and possibly some of the semifinals if the Celtics advance. He already planned to leave the bubble for a time if the team was still playing in September. His wife is pregnant and is scheduled to deliver sometime next month. With Hayward out, it could mean a shift to a three-guard lineup and more minutes for Marcus Smart, who has been filling the role of Boston\u2019s sixth man. Smart played 32 minutes in Game 1. He started 40 games during the shortened regular season. The Celtics went 14-6 without Hayward this season. Hayward, now in his third season with the Celtics, finished with 12 points, four rebounds and four steals in 34 minutes. Boston went on to win the game and take a 1-0 series lead over Philadelphia thanks to a combined 61 points from young swingmen Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. This season, Hayward seemed to brush away most of the mental trauma that had been lingering from his career-threatening ankle injury two years prior. He Hayward fractured a bone in his left hand on Nov. 9 and missed a month before returning to Boston\u2019s lineup. His numbers this season \u2014 17.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists per game on 38.3% 3-point shooting \u2014 are more in line with the stats he piled up as an All-Star with the Utah Jazz in 2016-17.

As with most things in life, the truth lies in the middle, pulling a bit from both extremes. The logistics alone would test the mind, body and probability. Imagine flying to four different cities in different time zones, risking traffic, arriving in time for tipoff, doing interviews and then actually writing something coherent before collapsing before midnight? Well, this year, and perhaps only this year, the playoffs are confined to two arenas and one city, a compressed situation created by a pandemic. Say goodbye to airline miles and Ubers and hello to convenience and proximity. All 16 playoff teams are stuck on an island, and traveling back and forth to games involves just a 200-yard trot between buildings, made slightly treacherous only by the humidity. Therefore, when the 2020 postseason began Monday with four games, the opportunity was too irresistible, historic and once-in-a-lifetime. The schedule: Jazz vs. Nuggets in the Rocky Mountain rivalry, followed by the defending Raptors against the Next Year Nets (when Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving return), then the historical grudge matchup between the Sixers and Celtics, capped by the headliner, Clippers vs. Mavericks. First tip at 1:45 pm, last buzzer at 11:45 pm. Exactly 10 hours of basketball bliss and meals missed. What was there to see? Well: Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray throwing buckets in a shootout and forcing overtime for a thrilling opening act ; the Raptors making a comfortable opening defense of their title; Boston taking advantage of the Ben Simmons-less Sixers; then a pair of questionable technicals and the ejection of Kristaps Porzingis costing Luka Doncic and the plucky Mavs against the Clippers . Here\u2019s how it went down: 1:45 pm : And we\u2019re off. Nikola Jokic wins the opening tip against Rudy Gobert. Theirs is a matchup of decorated big men who impact games. The real adjustment, though, is felt back in Denver and Salt Lake City, where it\u2019s 11:45 a.m., unofficially the earliest local playoff start in NBA history. 2:14 : Jordan Clarkson, replacing Mike Conley (paternity leave), falls on the floor, the Nuggets bench screams for a traveling call, he keeps his dribble, rises to feet and hits a 30-footer before the 24-second buzzer. An incredible shot that won\u2019t even rank in the top 10 before this game\u2019s over. 2:24: It\u2019s nine minutes left in the second quarter and Mitchell has only two points. This could change. 2:29 : Jazz coach Quin Snyder erupts after Clarkson gets a tech, telling the refs: \u201cHe got fouled twice on the 3. I haven\u2019t heard him say (bleep) to a ref all year.\u201d Then, after getting T\u2019d up by Scott Foster, Snyder innocently asks: \u201cWhat\u2019d I say?\u201d 3:47: Mitchell starts percolating. He hits a 3, then adds two free throws for his 40th point. Mitchell is running downhill to the rim with steam. Denver has no defense for this. 3:52: Mitchell\u2019s performance is becoming epic. Another three, then a layup. His total points now match his uniform number (45) and it\u2019s 109-105 Utah with two minutes left. \u201cWhat Donovan did tonight was not easy, especially against a team of that level,\u201d Snyder would say later. 3:54 : But then again \u2026 Mitchell commits an eight-second halfcourt violation while up four points with the ball. Murray seizes the opportunity and hits a 3-pointer. He proceeds to score 10 in the fourth quarter, ripping the game right out of Mitchell\u2019s hands. \u201cI put a little of this on myself with the eight-second violation and they hit that 3 and that changed the entire game right there. That\u2019s terrible on my part,\u201d Mitchell would say. 3:58 : Overtime means no chance to make the Raptors-Nets by tipoff. But, who cares? Jazz-Nuggets and Mitchell-Murray is too compelling. The defending champs can wait. 4:12 : Murray hits another 3 and that\u2019s a wrap. That\u2019s 10 more points in OT for Murray. Mitchell\u2019s 57 points are third-most in playoff history; only he and Jordan (63) scored at least 57 in a playoff loss. 4:20 : Didn\u2019t miss much at the start of the second game. Raptors are already up 10-2 on the Nets, who must play this series without Durant, Irving, DeAndre Jordan, Jason Kidd, Julius Erving, Derrick Coleman and Mike Gminski. 5:00 : OG Anunoby hits a 3 to make it a 29-point lead. The Raptors will have 68 points with four minutes left before halftime. Never underestimate the start of a champion. 5:46: Welp, Joe Harris\u2019 3 makes it a 13-point game. Harris is an unrestricted free agent in two months and it\u2019s questionable if the Nets can keep him because his shooting will be in demand. 5:58 : Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot chops the lead to eight. Nets play hard for Jacque Vaughn, who may get that interim tag removed to coach Durant and Irving next year. The Nets once trailed by 33. To quote a certain Raptors\u2019 celebrity fan, the Nets started this game from the bottom, now they\u2019re here. 6:01 : Jarrett Allen of all people hits a desperation 3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer, his first of the season. This team refuses to concede. 6:12 : Fred VanVleet, a soon-to-be unrestricted free agent, hits a 3-pointer and the Toronto lead is back to 15. He\u2019ll finish with 30. If there\u2019s any money to shell out this fall \u2014 who knows where the salary cap number will be \u2014 he\u2019s getting him some. \u201cHaving won a title, it kind of puts you at peace, and now it\u2019s time to kick it into another gear,\u201d he said. 6:15 : Anunoby grabs an offensive rebound, follows with a spin move, a dunk and 3-point play. It\u2019s 114-96. The Raptors keep finding talent. And now it\u2019s time to find another playoff game to watch. The night\u2019s halfway over. 6:30: Celtics players pause during warmups vs. Philly to watch good luck greetings from family members on the video screens. Brad Wanamaker\u2019s adorable daughter steals the show by telling her dad: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t win, that\u2019s fine because you put your effort into it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d 6:43: Only organ music plays when the Celtics have the ball, per request by the team, keeping with tradition at the TD Garden. 6:46: Kemba Walker attacks the basket for two. His knee has been in question since last winter but he looks frisky. 6:55: Joel Embiid already has 11 points midway through the first quarter. With Simmons out, leaving the Sixers at a considerable disadvantage, Embiid must be forceful. 7:22: Jayson Tatum heating up. He was a top-five player when the season went on hiatus in March. He\u2019s back in midseason form and will finish with a playoff career-high 32 points. 7:50 : Al Horford and Tobias Harris combine for 10 points at halftime. They also combined for $289 million when they signed free-agent contracts last summer. 8:02: Embiid has an animated discussion with coach Brett Brown during a late third-quarter timeout. He has only 12 points since getting those 11 in the first quarter. 8:23: Embiid returns and hits a 3-pointer to open the fourth. All\u2019s well, then. Six up for Sixers. 8:38: Horford gets a flagrant foul on Jaylen Brown, his former Celtics teammate. No harm, but the real injury is Horford has just six points and a mild impact with seven minutes left and the Sixers now down six. 8:48: Gordon Hayward crashes out of bounds and gets up limping . He heads straight to the locker room with three minutes left with an ankle sprain. There\u2019d be a hush in the crowd if there was a crowd. 8:55: Marcus Smart misses again, he\u2019s now 0-for-5. The good news: Brown gets 15 of his 29 points in the fourth to shut the door on Philly. On to the headliner game, but first, here\u2019s Tatum on Brown: \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how special and important JB is.\u201d 9:14: Montrezl Harrell is wearing a T-shirt in pregame warmups with a picture of his grandmother who recently passed. He missed all of the seeded games to attend her funeral and serve quarantine, which means he hasn\u2019t played basketball since March. Also, the Clippers will finally play a game with their full complement of players, almost a calendar year since training camp began. 10:05: Porzingis delivers an apparent clean block of George, then hears a whistle, then after throwing an air punch hears another when he gets a technical for complaining. This could come back to haunt him. 10:35: After Marcus Morris has words with Doncic, Porzingis rushes to protect his teammate and does nothing malicious, but he and Morris draw double techs . It\u2019s the second for Porzingis, who\u2019s auto ejected with the Mavs up five in the third. Later, Porzingis blamed himself, said the Clippers tend to provoke, but \u201cnot their main guys, just their other guys.\u201d At least Morris, one of those other guys, was contrite: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was enough to get technical fouls. I wish Porzingis played. It\u2019s the playoffs, man.\u201d 11:22: George and Kawhi Leonard are tag-teaming the Mavs in the fourth, as expected, to retake the lead for good. Doncic\u2019s tag-team partner is in the locker room. 11:42: Doncic is relentless anyway. He drops his 42nd point on a driving layup, the first player to get 40-plus in a playoff debut , but he feels a little like Mitchell right now. Therefore, this night of basketball will end how it started. 11:45: The buzzer sounds, the music plays, the four-game experiment is finally over. So that\u2019s a first full day of playoff basketball, which was four months in the making. The NBA postseason, after a delay, is off to a compelling launch in the most unlikely of places. Anyone adventurous enough to catch all four games on a single day might feel compelled to throw an air punch in celebration. But maybe it\u2019s better to take a tip from Kristaps Porzingis and just walk away. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Not Luka Doncic or Kristaps Porzingis, the Dallas Mavericks youngsters plowing through their first taste of NBA playoff action. Certainly not Rick Carlisle, the veteran coach who watched Doncic fight his way back from a brutal start to set the scoring record for a playoff debut and Porzingis get ejected in the third quarter of a game his team was leading by five after battling back from an early 16-point deficit. Carlisle said it after the Mavericks rallied to take a lead at the end of the first quarter. And he said it again after his team\u2019s 118-110 Game 1 loss to the LA Clippers in this Western Conference playoff series . \u201cIt\u2019s a long game,\u201d he said, \u201ca long series.\u201d It seemed far-fetched when Doncic was stumbling through the opening minutes; he had more turnovers than points when he went to the locker room to get his left ankle re-taped after a spill on his way to the basket. But not so much after the Mavericks\u2019 30-point turnaround before halftime and not even after Porzingis shoved Marcus Morris with 9:10 to play in the third quarter, coming to the aid of Doncic when the playoff intensity cranked up on a hard foul. The Clippers survived, of course, with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard combining for 56 points and shutting the door down the stretch. They were aided by what Clippers coach Doc Rivers called a \u201cphenomenal\u201d performance from Morris, whose 19 points were every bit as crucial as the physical defense he used to try and bother Doncic. Try being the operative word, since Doncic\u2019s 42 points put him atop a list that includes legends like George Mikan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving. The previous high was John Williamson\u2019s 38 in 1979. That\u2019s roughly 20 years before Doncic was born. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s amazing,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t think \u2026 I thought we guarded him pretty well. Forced him into a lot of tough shots. Forced him into 11 turnovers. I thought what we did poorly and what shows his greatness, is every time we made a mistake on the weak side, when we pulled in when we shouldn\u2019t have, he found that guy. And that guy made a shot. So I didn\u2019t mind his basket attacks, I didn\u2019t mind his threes. I mind our help so he can get the assist. I\u2019ll give up the points to him, I just don\u2019t want to give up the points and assists. And I thought we allowed him to have both tonight.\u201d Carlisle wasn\u2019t at all surprised that Doncic responded the way he did. You don\u2019t watch a 21-year-old pilot the most efficient offense in NBA history and worry about a turnover or mistake, not when he\u2019s working against a team many have picked as the title favorites. \u201cHe \u2019 s a fighter. He \u2019 s always going to battle. He will never get discouraged,\u201d Carlisle said of Doncic. \u201cHe \u2019 s got a very positive attitude on the floor with his teammates. He \u2019 s played in so many games in his young career that he \u2019 s seen everything. He \u2019 s seen slow starts, he \u2019 s seen situations where teams get off to great starts. You can \u2019 t get too high or too low. \u201cI love the fact that we didn \u2019 t get too low when we were down 10-0 to start the game. \u2026 I thought his performance was spectacular when you factor in everything and how often he \u2019 s getting hit, fouled, held and everything else.\u201d Porzingis had seen enough when Morris and Doncic got tangled up in the third quarter. He saw Morris shove Doncic and jumped into the fray, forgetting he\u2019d drawn an earlier technical for punching a fist in the air after being called for a foul, an automatic technical. It was his first career ejection. \u201c I understand we got into it a little bit and I saw him getting into Luka \u2019 s face and I didn \u2019 t like it,\u201d Porzingis said.  \u201cThat \u2019 s why I reacted. That \u2019 s a smart thing to do from their part and I just have to be smarter and control my emotions next time.\u201d Game 1 was every bit the long game Carlisle suggested it would be, physical and full of playoff-level intensity. Wednesday\u2019s Game 2 ( 9 ET, TNT ) could be another interesting affair, with the Mavericks full of confidence and the Clippers working with their full roster for just the second time since arriving in Orlando. If the Clippers aren\u2019t careful and can\u2019t find a way to slow down Doncic, this might become that long series Carlisle spoke of. \u201cThese games add up,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make it hard on him.\u201d Doncic, who joined Magic Johnson, LeBron James (twice) and Tracy McGrady as the only players to sore 40 or more points in a playoff game at 21 or younger, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201c For me, everything was the same,\u201d he said.  \u201cEvery game they \u2019 re going to be physical with me. I should never have 11 turnovers. That \u2019 s 11 more possessions I can have. The thing about this game is I \u2019 ve got to be way better than that for sure. \u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Even before tipoff, Brown explained the game plan Monday would \u201cbe revealed, I think quite clearly\u201d through the starting lineup chosen for the 21st postseason meeting between the teams. What quickly became apparent is Brown gambled on Philadelphia\u2019s size and physicality. He lost that wager to Boston\u2019s elite perimeter play, led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown combining for 61 points as the Celtics took a 1-0 lead in this Eastern Conference playoff series . Brown\u2019s move and the final result make for an intriguing chess match moving forward that likely finds Philadelphia forced to make the majority of the adjustments in this best-of-seven series. \u201cI hope that we can do a better job of defending them and some of the schemes we\u2019re trying to execute,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou can\u2019t minimize the fact that losing stinks, but I feel like there are answers to the question of why.\u201d Tatum and Brown became the first pair of Celtics teammates age 23 or younger to score 25 points in the same playoff game. \u201cWe\u2019re both hungry. We\u2019re both young guys,\u201d said Tatum, who scored a game-high 32 points to become the youngest Celtic to rack up 30 points and at least 10 rebounds (13) in a playoff outing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a bit of playoff experience. We\u2019ve been in some tough games together, some big moments, won some big games, lost some big ones. We\u2019ve both got a chip on our shoulder. It\u2019s one game. We ain\u2019t won the series. So, we\u2019ve got to get ready for the next game.\u201d Interestingly, Brown and the Sixers staff actually mulled over the idea of starting Matisse Thybulle going into Game 1, as the rookie had performed surprisingly well during the regular season and in the seeding games. As a defender, he possesses the skill set to slow down Tatum (especially with Ben Simmons out recovering from a knee surgery). As NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann pointed out , no player had defended Tatum more this season than Simmons, who guarded the Celtics wing for 24 minutes and 23 seconds over four games, according to data from Second Spectrum. Tatum shot 5-for-16 with Simmons on him during the regular season. With approximately six minutes remaining Monday, the Celtics All-Star had hit just 2-of-8 with Thybulle defending. Thybulle came off the bench to play nearly 33 minutes. Still, it\u2019s clear Brown wanted to accentuate Joel Embiid and Philadelphia\u2019s size advantage over the need to defend Tatum and Brown on the perimeter, given his decision to start Josh Richardson, Shake Milton and Tobias Harris alongside big men Al Horford and Embiid. \u201cI think to blow up the starting five in exchange for doing that, I\u2019m not prepared to say that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI look forward to going back and watching the tape and considering that option. But at the moment, I feel like it\u2019s just something I want to think more about based on what I see on the tape.\u201d Celtics forward Gordon Hayward should give Brown more to consider, too. Hayward suffered a right ankle injury with 3:08 left to play and didn\u2019t return after contributing 12 points. Brown also took a knee to his right quadriceps from Embiid with 8:12 left in the third quarter but returned to close out the game with 15 points in the fourth quarter. \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of pain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to fight. That\u2019s what it comes down to. Today, we came out, we battled a more physical team and we came out on top. So, I was proud of us. We\u2019ve got to keep that fight up if we want to win this series.\u201d Same goes for Philadelphia. But the perimeter prowess of Tatum and Brown, who chipped in 29 points on 9-of-16 from the floor and 5-of-8 from deep, wasn\u2019t the only obstacle holding back the Sixers as Boston\u2019s starters scored 101 of its 109 points. Embiid finished the game with 26 points and 16 rebounds, hitting 5-of-5 for a career-high 11 points in the first quarter, before taking just two shots in the second quarter, as the Celtics went into intermission leading 55-49. Brett Brown disagreed with the notion that Philadelphia needs to go more to Embiid \u2014 even as Embiid disagreed with Brown\u2019s disagreement. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do more,\u201d Embiid admitted. Miscues certainly mucked up the effort, too, overshadowing a strong Philadelphia bench performance (outscored Boston\u2019s reserves 23-8), led by Alec Burks\u2019 18 points. Boston racked up 21 points off 18 Sixers turnovers while besting them on the offensive glass for 16 points. The 76ers even outshot Boston 46.2% to 42.2% from the floor and 33.3% to 32.3% from deep. Philadelphia is averaging 18 turnovers in its last four postseason outings. \u201cPart of our turnovers came from getting stood up and trying to post,\u201d Brett Brown said. \u201cPart of our turnovers came when we didn\u2019t post. We weren\u2019t crisp passing out of the post. This is the double-edged sword that you have to figure out what line do you want to walk because the examples that I just gave are true. There\u2019s no doubt we want to get Joel the ball in different floor spots. It doesn\u2019t always have to be bully ball at the nail, where it\u2019s just a fistfight and everything gets stuck in mud. The volume of just smashmouth, bully ball, post-up, to do it all the time, it comes with some level of punishment if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d Philadelphia found that out the hard way in Game 1. * * * Michael C.

Their 73rd game and 38th loss of the season, a 134-110 victory for the defending champs, was the first game all season in which the Nets never held a lead . The Raptors had the league\u2019s best defense ( by a healthy margin ) in the seeding games and it began the postseason by putting the clamps on the Nets over the first six minutes. After ranking seventh offensively in the restart, Brooklyn scored just two points on its first eight possessions and just six on its first 13 times down the floor. But eventually, the Nets\u2019 offense was able to find good shots off ball movement. And behind the passing of Caris LeVert ( career-high 15 assists ) and the shooting of Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (26 points on 9-for-13 from the field), the Nets scored rather efficiently over the next 36 minutes. That wasn\u2019t enough, because the Raptors built a 33-point lead in the second quarter and held off the Nets in the fourth by shredding a Brooklyn defense that ranked 10th in the regular season (though just 18th in the restart). The defending champs\u2019 134 points on 101 possessions on Monday was their fourth-most efficient performance of the season and more efficient than any of their 24 games in last year\u2019s playoffs . 15 \u2014 Number of 3-pointers Fred VanVleet either made (8) or assisted on (7). In one sense, the Raptors\u2019 title defense began the same way last year\u2019s title run concluded . More than a year later, Fred VanVleet remains on fire. VanVleet ended last year\u2019s postseason by shooting 30-for-57 (53%) from 3-point range over the last nine playoff games. He kicked off this postseason by going 8-for-10 from beyond the arc as the Raptors tied their franchise record (set earlier this season against Washington) with 22 3-pointers. But VanVleet wasn\u2019t just draining open jumpers. He was also creating them. He dished out 11 assists ( his career playoff high ), with seven of those dimes coming on 3-pointers from his teammates. Two of the Raptors\u2019 22 3-pointers came in garbage time (the final 3:02), so VanVleet made or assisted on 15 of the champs\u2019 20 non-garbage-time 3-pointers. After taking just one shot ( a transition layup ) through the first 16 minutes of the game, VanVleet got going midway through the second quarter. VanVleet shot just 32.7% on pull-up 3-pointers this season, a mark that ranked 41st among 64 players who attempted at least 100. But he\u2019s probably not aware of that stat, and he was able to let it fly when the Nets gave him just enough space. \u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not, I feel I can get my shot off at any time,\u201d Mr. Bet On Yourself said afterward, \u201cespecially the way that defenses are playing me.\u201d His first two 3-pointers and then another in the third quarter were out of the Damian Lillard playbook \u2026 Play 1: Serge Ibaka sets a high screen on the right side of the floor for VanVleet. Though it\u2019s set far from the basket, Garrett Temple tries to go over it. Rodions Kurucs initially jumps above the 3-point line, but with no help on Ibaka\u2019s roll (because there\u2019s no Toronto shooter in the right corner), Kurucs retreats and VanVleet steps into a long 3. Play 2: On a sideline out-of-bounds play, the Raptors run a \u201cSpain\u201d pick-and-roll, with Marc Gasol (who\u2019s from Spain) setting a ball-screen for VanVleet and Kyle Lowry setting a back-screen on Jarrett Allen (guarding Gasol). Allen is focused on Lowry behind him and Tyler Johnson goes under the Gasol screen, giving VanVleet space to launch. Play 3: With Pascal Siakam setting a ball-screen for VanVleet, LeVert seems to be expecting a switch. But Luwawu-Cabarrot doesn\u2019t step up in time, and VanVleet drains another pull-up. \u201cFreddie hit \u2019em on some unders,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said afterward. \u201cWe set some ball screens and they were going under. Freddie\u2019s pretty good at stopping right behind those and shooting or on the other side.\u201d One of VanVleet\u2019s own 3-pointers and two of his 3-point assists ( one , two ) also came in transition. The Raptors are at their best in the open court and their 19 fast break points were right at their league-best, regular-season average . But VanVleet also created some open looks with dribble penetration in Toronto\u2019s half-court offense. VanVleet ranked 18th in the league with 14.3 drives per game, but the 37.1% he shot on drives was the second worst mark among 70 players with at least 200 field goal attempts off drives. Appropriately, among the 113 players who averaged at least five drives a game in 30 games or more, VanVleet was the most likely to pass on those drives , doing so 57% of the time. Play 1. An early attack against Chris Chiozza doesn\u2019t get VanVleet to the rim, but it draws the attention of Allen, leaving Ibaka wide open at the top of the arc. Play 2. After a make, VanVleet pushes up the floor, beats LeVert off the dribble, and again draws help from Allen. When he gets to the other side of the paint, Gasol has arrived for another wide-open 3. Play 3. The Raptors run the same out-of-bounds, \u201cSpain\u201d pick-and-roll play as above, though Lowry abandons the paint before setting the back-screen. Luwawu successfully is ready to make the switch onto VanVleet this time and he then beats VanVleet to the spot on an iso drive. Jeremiah Martin is in position to deny OG Anunoby in the left corner, but Anunoby shakes Martin, relocates to the wing, and drains a quick-release 3. The Nets have generally been good at defending the 3-point line; They were one of two teams that ranked in the top 10 in both opponent 3-point percentage (35.0%, ninth) and the (lowest) percentage of opponent shots that came from 3-point range (37%, 10th). But Allen is always going be looking to protect the rim, so the Raptors\u2019 centers (3-for-8 from 3 on Monday) should continue to see open looks from the perimeter off paint attacks from the guards and wings. \u201cI felt like I was collapsing and drawing the defense,\u201d VanVleet said, \u201cand guys were stepping up and making the shots. I just continued to put pressure on the defense and then I was able to shake free for a couple of 3s. Once a few of those went in, I knew it was going to be a big night for me. After the Nets scored just once on their first eight possessions, they got one of their easiest baskets of the night, a pick-and-roll lob from LeVert to Allen off an out-of-timeout play. A key here is keeping Lowry occupied by putting Joe Harris on the move. Harris initially sets a pin-down for Allen into the pick-and-roll, and then curls out to the left wing. Lowry chooses to stay attached to the shooter (now 23-for-42 from 3-point range in the bubble) rather than provide help on Allen\u2019s roll to the rim. VanVleet\u2019s \u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not\u2026\u201d declaration above was the quote of the day, but Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said something interesting before the game in regard to dealing with the Toronto defense, arguably the best in the league in rotating out of two-to-the-ball situations. Vaughn said that Nets would sometimes need to settle for \u201cgood\u201d shots instead of always seeking \u201cgreat\u201d looks. \u201cWe tend to talk about \u2018good to great,'\u201d he said, \u201cbut sometimes, they don\u2019t allow you to get great. They have a chance to recover. And sometimes good is going to be good enough.\u201d Brooklyn can head into Game 2 on Wednesday afternoon ( 1:30 ET, NBA TV ) believing that the Raptors aren\u2019t going to shoot 50% on 3-pointers or 97% from the free throw line again. But the Raptors can also expect sharper offensive performances from Lowry and Siakam, who combined to shoot 7-for-27 from the field on Monday. We\u2019ve already seen tinkering on the other end of the floor. Late in the first half of Game 1, the Nets started setting screens for LeVert higher (near the midcourt line) to give him a little more room to operate. The Raptors were more aggressive in double-teaming the Nets\u2019 bubble star in the second half, and Brooklyn may need to find somebody to be LeVert\u2019s escape valve in those situations, because Allen is not Draymond Green or Boris Diaw in regard to catching the ball in open space and acting as a 4-on-3 playmaker. On one fourth-quarter possession, Allen was running toward the next action (a screen for Harris) unaware that LeVert needed his help in dealing with the double \u2026 After the initial ugliness on the Nets\u2019 end of the floor, Game 1 turned into a fun battle between Brooklyn\u2019s drive-and-kick game and Toronto\u2019s rotations. We can expect more of the same in Game 2, with LeVert seeing a ton of attention and other guys needing to step up and make plays. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Which speaks to the mismatch Mitchell and the Utah Jazz face in their first-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets. Mitchell put himself in the NBA\u2019s postseason record book Monday \u2014 and his team in position to win Game 1 in the NBA\u2019s Disney campus. But the game dragged on too long for Mitchell and the Jazz to prevail, and the same probably will be true of the series, which the Nuggets now lead 1-0. Utah\u2019s All-Star guard scored 57 points, the third-most in NBA playoff history , while playing more than 43 of 53 minutes in the team\u2019s 135-125 overtime loss to Denver. He was a force from start almost to finish, taking over as the Jazz\u2019s primary ballhandler with veteran guard Mike Conley out of the bubble for the birth of his third child. Mitchell made 19 of 33 shots from the field, 13 of 18 from inside the arc, and went 13-for-13 from the foul line. He had nine rebounds and seven assists, and had Utah up by four, 109-105, with two minutes left in regulation. As for the history part, Mitchell now ranks behind only Hall of Famers Michael Jordan (63 points in 1986) and Elgin Baylor (61 points in 1962) for single-game scoring performances in the postseason. Of course, Jordan\u2019s Bulls got swept by Boston from the first-round series in which he scored 63, just as Baylor\u2019s 61 only fended off the Celtics a little longer in the 1962 Finals. Neither NBA legend had enough help against a better opponent, and that\u2019s the distinct impression Mitchell and the Jazz left after their thrilling but unsuccessful work in Game 1. That\u2019s where Murray\u2019s 36 points seemed like such a bonus for Denver. He didn\u2019t have to lug around the Nuggets on his back all afternoon. He eased into the opener with just two points in the first quarter, yet his team was up 31-28. Through three, he was having a nice game with 16 points, while Mitchell with 29 was burning bright nearly every trip downcourt. \u201cNot good for us,\u201d Denver center Nikola Jokic said later. With less than two minutes to go, Murray was stuck on 18. Then he took over, scoring another 18 over the final 6:39 of the fourth and overtime. The 6-foot-4 guard basically morphed into the weapon Mitchell had been through the game\u2019s first 46 minutes. Denver outscored Utah 30-16 from there, including a 20-10 spanking in overtime. \u201cHe had what, 57?\u201d Murray said of Mitchell immediately afterward. \u201cHe was killing us. We couldn\u2019t get a top so we had to find some offense. We just ran a two-man game. We went with what was comfortable.\u201d If Mitchell didn\u2019t run out of gas, he picked a bad time to lump together some crippling mistakes (three late turnovers). The first was a rare eight-second call when he brought up the ball too slowly with 1:46 left (Conley wouldn\u2019t have done that). Murray immediately rose up for a 3-pointer to get Denver within 109-108. Mitchell also had two of Utah\u2019s four turnovers to start overtime, helping the Nuggets seize control with an 11-2 start. What began as a two-man game for the Jazz \u2014 Mitchell and Rudy Gobert teaming up in pick-and-rolls, as well as Mitchell scoring and Gobert defending \u2014 turned into a two-man duel of Mitchell and Murray late. Closer to the end, it was Denver\u2019s two-man game of Murray and Jokic doing the \u201ccomfortable\u201d things Murray mentioned. Denver\u2019s deeper roster was the problem most insiders expected. The Nuggets\u2019 bench outscored Utah\u2019s 38-26 and placed all four subs in positive plus\/minus land. With Conley missing, coach Quin Snyder started rookie Juwan Morgan, an undrafted rookie from Indiana, signed an Exhibit 10 contract with the Jazz last summer and was making the first start of his NBA life. Morgan hit a 3-pointer and grabbed seven rebounds in 25 noble minutes. But he wasn\u2019t a difference-maker while trying to fill the shoes of someone (Conley) who might have been. Even with Will Barton (foot) and Gary Harris (hip) inactive, Nuggets coach Mike Malone had other tools on his belt like Jerami Grant (19 points) and Mason Plumlee to work the glass. He trusted the whole OT to Murray, Jokic and three reserves.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many guys,\u201d Murray said. \u201cSo many guys who can start on other teams. So many guys who can put the ball in the loop. So many who can defend. We\u2019ve got two guys who are out. \u201cIf a guy [Mitchell] has 75 or 80, winning is the most important thing,\u201d the Nuggets guard added. \u201cYou\u2019re scoring to win. You\u2019re getting stops to win. \u2026 I can have two in one quarter and we\u2019ll be up. That\u2019s my nature.\u201d Murray said he and Mitchell did some \u201cgood\u201d trash-talking through what was a fun game for players and viewers alike. A camera caught them smiling and chatting near the end. But these are the playoffs, where it\u2019s all fun and games until one guy reminds the other about how much help he actually lacks. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Harrell has emerged from the NBA\u2019s quarantine in time to join the team against the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series ( 9 ET, ESPN ). Before tip-off, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Harrell, a finalist for 2019-20 Kia Sixth Man of the Year, would play \u201cvery little\u201d in Game 1. This was Harrell\u2019s first time on the court with teammates since he left the season restart on July 17 because of a family emergency. The Clippers were hopeful Harrell could play in the team\u2019s final seeding game last Friday, but he was not able to as he was still in quarantine. Harrell posted early last week on Twitter that he was back on the NBA campus . He was then required to quarantine for at least four days. The league has said quarantine for those who leave the bubble can last as much as 10 days or more if those individuals are not tested daily while they are away. One of the top reserve players in the NBA this season, Harrell is averaging career highs in minutes (27.8), points (18.6) and rebounds (7.1). He didn\u2019t play in any of the eight seeding games, so he will get thrown into the playoffs. Patrick Beverley (calf strain) and Landry Shamet (left foot sprain) have been nursing injuries for the Clippers since the season restart.

Per Eric Walden of The Salt Lake Tribune , Morgan will start at power forward. The rest of the Jazz lineup will consist of Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles in the backcourt and Royce O\u2019Neal and Rudy Gobert in the frontcourt.

Playoff teams will split a record $23,287,266 for making the NBA postseason, a figure that\u2019s up about $1.6 million from last year. And the Milwaukee Bucks stand to grab the biggest share of a pool ever, if they win the NBA title. The Bucks would split $6,827,848 if they won the NBA championship, based on the formula worked out by the NBA. The Bucks have already secured $1,606,897 from the pool by having the best record in the NBA, the best record in the Eastern Conference and making the first round. The top six teams in each conference get a bonus for their finish in the regular season. From there, the breakdown is this: * First-round qualifiers make $347,545. * Conference semifinalists get another $413,534. * Conference finalists get another $683,363. The biggest slices, of course, go to the teams that make the NBA Finals. The losing team receives another $2,732,699, while the NBA champions get another $4,124,054. For winning the NBA title last season, the Toronto Raptors split $5.6 million from the playoff pool. If Kawhi Leonard wins an NBA Finals MVP award with the Los Angeles Clippers this season, he\u2019d do something that nobody has ever done \u2014 three finals MVPs with three different teams. Leonard was finals MVP for San Antonio in 2014 and for Toronto last year. Besides Leonard, only LeBron James (with Miami in 2012 and 2013, then Cleveland in 2016) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (with Milwaukee in 1971 and the Los Angeles Lakers in 1985) have won finals MVPs with two different franchises. If the Lakers or Clippers win the title, it\u2019ll be another rarity. If the Lakers win, James and Danny Green (San Antonio, Toronto) would have championships with three different teams; if the Clippers win, Leonard would be on that list. The only players in NBA history to win titles with three different teams, to this point, are John Salley and Robert Horry. Division championships in the NBA don\u2019t seem to mean much anymore. Well, maybe they do. If history holds, one of these six teams \u2014 Toronto, Milwaukee, Miami, Denver, Houston or the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 will win the NBA title this season. Every finals team since 2012 has done so after winning a division title. The last team not to win its division but make the finals was Dallas, which won the title in 2011. And the last time an NBA Finals had two non-division-winning teams was 2007, when San Antonio topped Cleveland. A few numbers to watch during the playoffs: * LeBron James is 89 points away from 7,000 career postseason points. Nobody else has even reached 6,000; Michael Jordan had 5,987. James nearly has more playoff points than any other three players entering these playoffs do in their postseason careers combined. James Harden (2,654), Russell Westbrook (2,489) and Kawhi Leonard (2,164) have 7,307 between them. * If the Lakers make a deep run, James could also take over the No. 1 spot on the postseason games played list. He\u2019s been in 239, behind Derek Fisher (259), Tim Duncan (251) and Robert Horry (244). James is already the NBA career playoff leader in minutes, field goals made and attempted, free throws made and steals. * Boston\u2019s Gordon Hayward has made 95.5% of his playoff free throws (106 for 111). Nobody with at least 100 career postseason makes from the line has ever been better; Mark Price is No. 2 at 94.4%. For the first time since 2015, teams with a losing record made the playoffs. And for the first time since 1997, three teams below the .500 mark found their way into the postseason. Portland, Brooklyn and Orlando all finished the regular season with losing records \u2014 yet are still alive in the race for the NBA title. Boston and Brooklyn were the last teams to get to the playoffs with losing marks, both getting there in 2015. Minnesota, Phoenix and the LA Clippers were the three teams that did it in 1987. The last time there were more than three sub-.500 teams in the playoffs was 1986, when six made the field. No team with a losing record has won a playoff series since 1987, when the Seattle SuperSonics won two rounds to reach the West finals. Since that season, sub-.500 teams are 0-26 in first-round matchups. Aaron Smith and Dedric Taylor will part of the playoff referee staff for the first time, the lone postseason rookies on the 40-person roster for the first round. Smith is one of four alternates, and Taylor is one of the 36 referees chosen to call games. Smith is in his fourth NBA season and worked the G League finals in 2016 and 2017. Taylor is in his sixth NBA season, eventually getting there after spending 13 years driving for UPS and working for the parks and recreation department in North Miami Beach, Florida. The rest of the lineup of officials for Round 1: Mark Ayotte, Curtis Blair, Tony Brothers, Tony Brown, James Capers, Derrick Collins, Sean Corbin, Kevin Cutler, Marc Davis, Kane Fitzgerald, Tyler Ford, Brian Forte, Scott Foster, Pat Fraher, John Goble, David Guthrie, Bill Kennedy, Courtney Kirkland, Eric Lewis, Tre Maddox, Ed Malloy, Rodney Mott, Gediminas Petraitis, Kevin Scott, Michael Smith, Ben Taylor, Josh Tiven, James Williams, Leon Wood, Sean Wright and Zach Zarba. Along with Aaron Smith, the alternates are Brett Barnaky, Nick Buchert and Mark Lindsay. Foster has the most playoff experience, working the postseason for the 21st time. He\u2019s one of six referees on this season\u2019s postseason roster with more than 100 games worked, with 188 \u2014 the others being Brothers (140), Capers (135), Davis (132), Malloy (111) and Kennedy (104). If the Toronto Raptors win this NBA title, there can be no doubt that the team\u2019s magic number this season would be 23. Or maybe 23-9, to be more specific. When the season was stopped on March 11 because of the pandemic, the Raptors were exactly 23-9 at home and 23-9 on the road. At Disney in the seeding games, they went 7-1. They went 16-8 last season in the playoffs, and if they do exactly that this year \u2014 yes, they would have gone exactly 23-9 at Disney this year as well. Inevitably, some version of the stat that says Game 1 winners almost always go on to win a best-of-seven series will come up after the opening game of every matchup. And it is true: Since the 16-team playoff format was adopted, teams with a 1-0 series lead ultimately win 78.3% of the time. But last year showed that 1-0 deficits don\u2019t doom a club, either. There were six teams last season that lost Game 1 but went on to win a series \u2014 matching the most of any year in the 16-team format. The six teams that rallied were Toronto (East finals vs. Milwaukee and first round vs. Orlando), Milwaukee (East semifinals vs. Boston), Portland (West semifinals vs. Denver), Philadelphia (East first round vs. Brooklyn) and Denver (West first round vs. San Antonio). Since 1984, home teams have won 411 of 540 playoff games played \u2014 76.1%. Of course, much of that can be attributed to having 20,000 or so screaming fans cheering teams on in those games. Will it matter without fans in the bubble? Time will tell. During the restart, teams went 49-39 in matchups designated as \u201chome\u201d games \u2014 a 55.7% clip in those contests where they got to see their logos on the video boards and hear their usual pregame music. And that is close to what teams were doing outside the bubble this season, when home teams prevailed 55.1% of the time.

I\u2019m not talking about my energy or amount of stories to tell you, dear reader, because that\u2019s what they pay me the little bucks for. This is about clothes and specifically the last unworn item: A golf shirt, and not just any golf shirt, but an NBA Summer League golf shirt. It\u2019s a 2020 relic, like so many other events that went poof this year. You might get dizzy if you pause to consider what was supposed to happen but didn\u2019t, all wiped out by a pandemic. The list is staggering in scope and diversity, and this is just a micro-sampling: March Madness, Finals Four, Olympics, Wimbledon, along with the South by Southwest Festival, the Oscars, ComicCon and also DEF CON. (That last one is a hacking conference that, in hindsight, sounds like something that actually did happen in 2020).  The NBA was fortunate to slip the All-Star Game through the door before Rudy Gobert\u2019s positive coronavirus test helped slam it shut about a month later. Here we are now, preparing to crown a champion soon in a place where crowd voices won\u2019t rise and confetti won\u2019t fall. The golf shirt was saved until last by design because of the symbolism. The NBA restart is very much like a Las Vegas Summer League, only with real players instead of loaded with prospects who are just passing through on their way to Europe or a regular 9-to-5 job. Here at Disney, the teams stay in three hotels, players often see each other in the hallways, some ride the elevator together and all of those interactions are a mixture of camaraderie and also uneasiness. For example, if LeBron James bumps into his longtime pal Carmelo Anthony, that\u2019s good. If Damian Lillard bumps into Pat Beverley \u2014 and we do mean \u201cbump\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s bad. NBA Summer League is held every July and is fantastic for reporters, general managers and coaches because it\u2019s stress free, festive and filled with optimism. Also, it serves as the final official NBA event of a long season, which means there\u2019s no basketball in the ensuing weeks and months, and that\u2019s always a bittersweet moment. You\u2019re relived to a degree that another year\u2019s in the books, yet sorrowful because the next chance for the NBA family to mingle isn\u2019t until October. That calendar has obviously been thrown for a loop. This is now an emergency session of basketball taking place in summertime, and while it has gone tremendously well \u2014 can we rename the championship trophy after Adam Silver just for this year? \u2014 everything is being squished together. The Finals will be followed days later by the Draft, and then free agency, and then we\u2019ll all take a nap and get ready for training camp in November (or at least that\u2019s the ambitious plan). There\u2019s talk about having a Fall League to replace the Summer League although I\u2019m not sure anyone has signed off on that, or even wants it at this point. So to honor the memory of Vegas basketball, I will wear the NBA Summer League shirt proudly today. By the way, I pack light, and for this reboot in Orlando I used only one suitcase. That sounds insane for a trip that\u2019ll last months, but they do have washing machines here and besides, I\u2019m a guy; we just need lots of underwear and some sandals. Oh, and our favorite golf shirt. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

Now, say it three times fast. Conley left the Orlando bubble Sunday morning, heading home to Columbus, Ohio, to be with wife Mary for the birth of their third child. Due to the NBA\u2019s quarantine protocols, the veteran playmaker is expected to miss at least Games 1 and 2 of the Western Conference\u2019s No. 3 vs. No. 6 series. The shortest amount of time thus far for any NBA player returning to the bubble, assuming daily coronavirus tests have been negative, has been four days. The Nuggets and the underdog Jazz are the first teams out of the chute, their opener set for Monday ( 1:30 ET, ESPN ) at The Field House on the Disney campus in central Florida. Game 2 is Wednesday afternoon, with subsequent games scheduled every other day into next week. The Jazz knew this was coming, just not right now: The baby\u2019s due date was Aug. 27, which would have nudged Conley\u2019s absence to either later in \u2014 or after \u2014 the series. No one notified the child, obviously, of the league\u2019s playoff schedule. Utah, as one of the league\u2019s family-friendliest organizations, had agreed that Conley would leave the team for his son\u2019s birth. But the timing of his absence brings a few challenges, particularly in a first round moving faster this year (no travel, compressed calendar). Conley has taken heat for a sub-par performance in this first season with the Jazz. The 32-year-old\u2019s $32.5 million salary is a lightning rod for critics, too. This could introduce a new round of second-guessing, unfair or not. Here are three questions to be answered during Conley\u2019s hiatus: The ball likely will wind up in Donovan Mitchell\u2019s hands more than it already does. Mitchell, the Jazz\u2019s leading scorer (24.0 ppg), also is the team\u2019s big usage guy (30.8). Fellow wing Jordan Clarkson only started twice this season but probably plugs Conley\u2019s spot in the lineup, which further thins Utah\u2019s bench. Clarkson did average 24.0 points in three appearances against the Nuggets, hitting 14 of his 24 3-point attempts. Conley is a veteran with 56 games of playoff experience, a solid resume given the franchise\u2019s 27 postseason games in the past seven years. The team\u2019s 1-2 punch of center Rudy Gobert and Mitchell have logged 25 and 16, respectively. Though he averaged 14.4 points, 4.4 assists and 3.2 rebounds overall this season, Conley had a bigger impact vs. Denver. In two meetings, he averaged 20.5 points, 5.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds, while hitting 40% from the arc. Stylistically, the point guard\u2019s absence could be missed most in pick-and-rolls, a weapon Denver doesn\u2019t always defend well. But his scoring is important, too, to take pressure off Mitchell and fill some of the points void opened by Bojan Bogdanovic\u2019s season-ending wrist surgery. Their superior depth gets deeper for as long as Conley is out. And that really could matter if Denver guards Gary Harris (hip) and\/or Will Barton (knee) are able to return to action. Neither played in the bubble. The more numbers the Nuggets can throw at Mitchell without Conley to help, the shorter Utah\u2019s playoff life expectancy. It was already going to be tough for Gobert and Mitchell to match the production of Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. It is worth noting that while Utah was 26-21 when Conley started this season, it was even better at 18-7 when he did not. He missed 19 of 20 games from early December to mid-January with a hamstring injury, during which the Jazz went 16-4. But Bogdanovic was on board then.

Getting a tee time or streaming video games might not be as much of a priority as it was a few weeks ago, either. Summer vacation is over. The restart gets real now. The NBA playoffs start Monday, the beginning of a two-month journey to see which team will be able to say it won a championship. It would come in the most unusual, most trying season the league has ever seen because of a shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic and 22 teams eventually moving into a so-called bubble at the Disney complex in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, to salvage the season. \u201cThis is why we got here, why we worked so hard, why everyone put their egos aside and put their effort into this, so we could get to that point where we could crown a champion,\u201d said guard Kyle Lowry of the defending champion Toronto Raptors. \u201cThe best part of the NBA season is the playoffs.\u201d The Raptors are back, with realistic aspirations to repeat their title. The Eastern Conference field also includes the Milwaukee Bucks, who posted the best regular-season record for the second consecutive year and have a likely back-to-back MVP in Giannis Antetokounmpo. In the Western Conference, for the first time since 2015, the Golden State Warriors won\u2019t be going to the NBA Finals \u2014 their gap year, so to speak, meant they fell to the bottom of the West as they look to reset with a healthy Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson next season, possibly with the No. 1 overall draft pick as well. LeBron James is back in the playoffs, after taking the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 who couldn\u2019t get to the postseason in his injury-marred first year in Hollywood \u2014 to the best record in the West. He\u2019s gone to the NBA Finals in each of his last eight postseason trips; four with Miami, then four more with Cleveland. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot this year,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters last week. \u201cBut really, all of it is just a buildup to us \u2026 going into the playoffs. So we\u2019re here, we\u2019re excited about it and confident in what we can accomplish.\u201d The matchups: Milwaukee-Orlando, Toronto-Brooklyn , Boston-Philadelphia and Indiana-Miami in the East, with the Lakers against play-in game winner Portland, the Los Angeles Clippers against Dallas , Denver-Utah and Houston-Oklahoma City . Some of those clubs can say they are happy to be in the postseason. For others, only a title will do. \u201cI didn\u2019t mention that we secured the 2 seed,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the locker room talked about it. We really don\u2019t care. Like, we want to win it all. \u2026 That\u2019s the only thing that matters right now for us.\u201d Teams have been in the bubble for nearly six weeks now, first for a couple weeks of training camp, then three scrimmages followed by eight seeding games that were critical to some clubs and little more than tuneups to others. The vibe was different in the opening days of bubble life. Bass fishing on the Disney campus was all the rage, more than a few players tried golf for the first time \u2014 a group from one team, perhaps not yet fully versed in golf etiquette, tried to play with nine people, compared with the typical max of four \u2014 and everything from poker tabletops to wine fridges were being shipped in to help players pass the time. Some gamers have put down their controls for the next few weeks; Miami\u2019s Meyers Leonard, generally considered the best Call of Duty player in the NBA, announced that he needs a break to focus on the playoffs. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s time to lock in and help my team win a championship,\u201d Leonard said. There\u2019s no travel in these playoffs, obviously. It\u2019ll be 16 teams, with games limited to two arenas at Disney. For the first round, it\u2019ll be four games per day at each site, meaning drama will begin in the early afternoon and continue until late in the evening. Outside the Disney gates, the coronavirus pandemic continues. Most NCAA sports won\u2019t be played this fall, and college football\u2019s hopes seem to be hanging by a thread. When the U.S. Open tennis tournament begins this month, both reigning champions \u2014 Rafael Nadal and Bianca Andreescu \u2014 will be among the many big names sitting out because of virus concerns. Baseball has dealt with outbreaks , though it continues pushing to complete its much-shortened season. But inside the bubble, daily testing is working and the value of the strict protocols has been proven. No players inside have had a confirmed positive test and now the best time of the NBA year is set to begin. Finally. \u201cTwo months ago, it didn\u2019t really look like this was a realistic opportunity,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cYou just see what\u2019s going on around the world. Other leagues, colleges, not everybody has been given this opportunity to continue to do what you love. We have and we want to take advantage of it.\u201d"},{"id":26406,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-giannis-not-playing-primetime","date":"2020-08-16","title":"Bucks have star power, but stuck vying for public's attention","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 He\u2019s a transformational player who leads the team with the best record in the NBA, a \u201cfreak\u201d in the complimentary sense, worthy of all the applause thrown his way and is expected to shatter all salary records this time next year. Giannis Antetokounmpo certainly fits the description of a matinee idol, and the TV networks are certainly making sure of that. Giannis and the Bucks are shoved into the matinee spots for the first round of the playoffs \u2014 their weekday afternoon tipoff times are more in line with NFL Sunday kickoff times. Those early playoff slots are usually reserved for teams and players with low national appeal and expectations. If you have a Zoom call scheduled or an important lunch date, then cancel all plans to see the top-seeded team in the NBA playoffs and the player who might win back-to-back MVPs. What\u2019s really curious is how this distinction runs polar opposite for LeBron James and the Lakers, who\u2019ll understandably get nightly TV love. It simply confirms the suspicion that even if Giannis takes the top individual honors once again, LeBron will keep a vice grip on the people\u2019s MVP \u2014 Most Valuable Primetime. Yes, someone will mention the Bucks\u2019 low-wattage first-round opponent, the Orlando Magic, and Milwaukee being a small-market city as reasons why three of the Bucks\u2019 first four games will tip at 1 or 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time. But LeBron seldom, if ever, played afternoon playoff games with mid-market Cleveland \u2014 no matter whom the Cavs faced. Since the medium tends to reflect the demand of viewers, there\u2019s a greater issue here, and it\u2019s about the appetite for the Bucks and their superstar, who find themselves in a very strange position as they and 15 other teams embark on an equally-strange playoff journey here at this single-site NBA campus. \u201cI feel like my whole career, even this year, as good as we have been, they haven\u2019t been paying a lot of attention to us,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe have the focus to win even though they don\u2019t talk about us. At the end of the day all that matters is what we do. We\u2019re going to try to improve every day, focus on us, how we get better and how we go out there and compete. As long as we do that, we\u2019ll be in a good place.\u201d The Bucks fought all season to seize the league\u2019s best record and the major perk that accompanies that \u2014 home-court advantage throughout the postseason. Obviously, that was all for naught, since not a single game will be played in Fiserv Forum, which quickly became a very loud Bucks\u2019 mosh pit in its very short history. The Bucks were 30-5 on their court, second only to the Sixers for home cooking, which means there will only be artificial help pumping through the loudspeakers inside the Disney-based arenas if the Bucks find themselves needing a motivational boost. Also, basketball sentiment this fall probably rests with LeBron in his quest to win a third championship with a third team, while the betting money is being placed on the LA Clippers, maybe more than the Bucks, to win it all. So the Bucks will emphasize their selling points \u2014 3-point shooting and defense \u2014 and if all else fails, throw the ball to the reigning Kia MVP and give him room. That formula was good from October through March before the NBA pulled the plug on the season. \u201cWe believe in it,\u201d said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cA lot of it starts with our defense. We\u2019re good defensively and that fuels part of our offense. We can be better in our spacing and getting to those spots. We have a ton of faith in our guys. The great thing about this team is they love the challenge and love competing. We\u2019re very excited and happy to be saying we\u2019re starting the playoffs.\u201d Somehow, that doesn\u2019t register much on the national thrill scale. Over the last two decades, the teams that compiled the best records in the NBA usually found a massive, widespread audience. That includes the LeBron Cavs, the \u201cBig Three\u201d Heat, the Stephen Curry Warriors, even the Derrick Rose Bulls; maybe the lone exception being the fundamentally-sound San Antonio Spurs. Television gravitated to those fun teams because of star power and greatness and also because the audience either wanted them to succeed or fail spectacularly. The Bucks? By putting them on to compete against daytime soap operas, TV says they generate ho-humdrum. The other issue is the prime-time shows nationally that\u2019ll compete with the NBA right now. Baseball games are in full swing, and because this is an election year, the political shows are enjoying robust ratings. LeBron can challenge that, yet there\u2019s not as much faith in Giannis. So this is somewhat a referendum on Giannis and his ability to quicken the basketball pulse, especially those belonging to the casual basketball audience. It\u2019s a strange if not awkward position for a superstar to find himself. Is Giannis on a first-name basis in the basketball world because he\u2019s an otherworldly talent, or because it\u2019s easier to pronounce than his last name? The talent cannot be denied. Giannis delivered spectacularly during this fractured season and was arguably better than his MVP season of a year earlier. His 29.5 points and 13.6 rebounds rated fifth and second league-wide, and he also added 5.6 assists as the point man for the Bucks\u2019 offense (all while playing just 30.4 minutes per game). He\u2019s a finalist for this year\u2019s MVP along with LeBron and James Harden. Antetokoumpo is also the favorite to win Kia Defensive Player of the Year for his stellar work there, often guarding multiple positions while cleaning the glass. A star with an amazing backstory involving his large family\u2019s immigration from Africa to Greece, and his rapid basketball development, and someone who\u2019s polite, easy with the smile and sinister on the floor should enjoy a higher profile. Not that he seems terribly troubled by that. \u201cMy goal is to win a championship and lead my team,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my teammates are going to help me be great.\u201d Obviously, there are some in Milwaukee who\u2019ll exhale after hearing that. Giannis becomes a free agent next summer and the small Midwestern town hardly offers the cultural affections of big-city life. Those charms would appear to appeal to an international player with ambitions of becoming a global sensation. Often, the small-town issue is overblown; Damian Lillard makes millions in endorsements while tucked away in the Pacific Northwest with the Blazers, same for Russell Westbrook when the former MVP was based in Oklahoma City. TV doesn\u2019t love those towns, though, unless LeBron happens to get his mail delivered there. Anyway, the saga of Giannis and his future plans are a hot-take for another day. If the Bucks win a championship in October, those discussions could be moot. In the meantime, the Bucks will launch the pursuit of that trophy by toiling in the afternoon, feeling the urge to title their journey as The Days Of Our Lives or The Young And The Restless. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d said guard Eric Bledsoe, briefly forgetting the Bucks will play closer to the start of the day, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to reach one goal. If they have us playing at 9 in the morning, we\u2019ll play at 9. It don\u2019t matter.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

One of the largest sites on the Walt Disney World campus is quite full, especially on Mondays, when the place is packed almost to the rafters. They\u2019re arriving by the truckloads, cramming every available spot, all here to see LeBron James. And Chris Paul. And Jimmy Butler. And Jayson Tatum. And, well, just about everyone on all the playoff rosters. This is the NBA\u2019s mail and package receiving station, which serves as the initial checkpoint for incoming shipments, and it\u2019s a post office on steroids. With players and coaches and other personnel separated from their families and their typical lifestyles for more than two months now, the demand for care packages is steep.  And speaking of tall, has anyone found the mislabeled box intended for Bol Bol, the Denver Nuggets\u2019 7-foot-2 rookie center? He was in here the other day, sifting through the supplies and checking the tracking number. It\u2019s a mystery how someone on the outside could fail to properly address a package to a player with the same name-name. A warehouse attached to the Coronado Springs Resort is needed to satisfy all the daily mail activity. Heather Messer, the senior director of league operations and point person for the shipments, says the place gets at least 800 packages a day, typically 1,000. On the busiest of days, the number is closer to 1,100 packages \u2014 all of different sizes and shapes and weights. The warehouse spans 30,000 feet, \u201cand we fill the majority of it,\u201d she said. The entire operation is impressive in terms of scope, efficiency and range of packages. The items that fall from the trucks and flow through the doors reveal plenty about the players themselves, their likes and tastes and their personalities. Who knew Rudy Gobert was a table tennis fanatic? The Utah Jazz\u2019s All-Star center ordered a table and it sits, still folded, inside the warehouse. It is waiting to be claimed by an owner who\u2019s not in a rush, obviously confident he and the Jazz are not leaving Disney anytime soon. There\u2019s also a few pinball machines, ordered by the Milwaukee Bucks, and the heavy suspicion is those thrill-seeking Lopez twins \u2014 Brook and Robin \u2014 are big pinball wizards. Just days ago, the compassionate folks at Adidas sent care packages to every player who endorses the brand. They each received an NBA arcade game along with a four-foot barrel that\u2019s filled with Adidas swag and so forth. Does James Harden and Damian Lillard, who each make north of $40 million a season in salary alone, really need more sneakers, T-shirts and toys? That\u2019s beside the point: NBA players are trapped on campus and so their families and friends and companies are doing their part to make this extended stay as comfortable as possible. \u201cMan, those care packages are nice and right on time,\u201d said Houston Rockets forward PJ Tucker. \u201cI always look forward to those.\u201d The two heaviest and strangest items received so far \u2014 it\u2019s only August and The Finals end in mid-October \u2014 are a refrigerator and a leg press machine. Every player hotel room has a mini-refrigerator but those don\u2019t make ice, so someone had his team purchase a real one, too. The Bucks had the leg press machine shipped from Milwaukee and the only problem is the steel brontosaurus is too large to fit in the elevators and inside the doors of the player rooms. So it sits idle in the warehouse, where Giannis Antetokounmpo has yet to give it a try. \u201cI had to bring a punching bag to a player\u2019s room that was shipped here during quarantine,\u201d said Vernon Peterson, an office coordinator who assists with the process. \u201cI guess you gotta work out, you know.\u201d Next on the who-knew list is a Casper mattress, fresh off the Amazon truck. \u201cI guess after six weeks,\u201d Messer said, \u201csomeone decided they needed a new bed.\u201d Players are ordering up a storm on Amazon, which sends trucks three or four times daily to the NBA campus here. Tucker, who\u2019s a big sneaker head, has purchased multiple pairs of shoes for his vast collection. Players are ordering microwave ovens by the dozens. The Disney golf courses are open to players, and first-time golfers recently bit by the bug here are buying golf clubs. Same is true for fishing gear: players here are learning to fish for the first time and buying rods and lures. Two other products stand out in terms of supply and frequency: wine and water. The desire for wine is understandable as players are using alcohol to wind down after practice and games. Some of them, such as Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum, have their own brands or are getting into the business. Along with hundreds of cases of wine, players are buying wine coolers, too.  \u201cI didn \u2019 t think so many would ship wine,\u201d Messer said. \u201cI thought it was more of a beer world here.\u201d As for water, it\u2019s everywhere in the warehouse. Not only that, the range of water companies is vast, proving that when it comes to water, not all taste the same, evidently. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Waiakea water ,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHave you heard of Eternal Water ? I\u2019ve heard of Essential water. But Eternal comes in by the case. And Topo Chico water ? That\u2019s over here.\u201d The packages, from envelopes to crates, all must pass health inspection as the coronavirus pandemic rages and the league remains hypersensitive about safety. That means the packages get spritzed with Clorox outside in the parking lot once they\u2019re unloaded from the truck. Then they\u2019re dollied into the warehouse and sorted and recorded by tracking number on computers. The total so far exceeds 60,000 and counting. Messer is now 30 years on the job and her normal shipping sites during a normal season are All-Star weekend and The Finals. \u201cCompared to this,\u201d she said, \u201cthey don\u2019t compare.\u201d More than anyone else, she has a pulse on the players, their appetites and lifestyles. Or maybe their adjusted appetites and lifestyles as it\u2019s all about blending into your surroundings. \u201cI wonder how much of this is about adapting to life in here,\u201d Messer said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with sitting in your room or getting out, what can you do here? So, they\u2019ll buy things that they can use here. \u201cMaybe fishing, people are taking up golf, the lawn games, they\u2019ll buy pool floats but mainly the extra large ones. It\u2019s like, hey, let\u2019s make the best of what we can do while we\u2019re here as opposed to doing nothing.\u201d But \u2026 100 tennis racquets? One team ordered that. \u201cI guess they wanted to hold a tournament,\u201d Messer said. One item inside the warehouse seems curious. It\u2019s a pair of basketball hoops, sitting untouched, except for when a deliveryman gets the urge to shoot a 3-pointer after dropping off packages. Messer said those originally were to be set up in the hotel parking lots and used by workers and media, but social distancing rules nixed that idea. With the NBA getting ready for the start of the playoffs on Aug. 17, and with further reductions coming as teams get eliminated, the amount of mail should decrease. Or so it would appear. \u201cRemember, the families of the players are coming here pretty soon,\u201d Messer said. Which means wives, significant others and kids are already placing their orders. The NBA\u2019s gonna need a bigger warehouse. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

That\u2019s because, until Saturday\u2019s dramatic 126-122 play-in victory against the Grizzlies, any mention of \u201cMcCollum\u201d and \u201cback\u201d carried a painful and negative meaning for the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 crucial shotgun rider and No. 2 punch to Damian Lillard\u2019s No. 1. For much of his time here in the NBA restart, McCollum winced whenever that part of his anatomy \u2014 a fractured vertebrae is the diagnosis \u2014 was raised in conversation and especially when it was pushed on the floor. But now? Perhaps the basketball gods are ready to have mercy, not only on McCollum, but the Blazers and their chances of showing some staying power in their upcoming first-round playoff matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers. And that\u2019s really what this is all about: the next step. The Blazers seemed poised to power past the young and inexperienced Grizzlies for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference no matter what; Lillard\u2019s scorching performances of late virtually guaranteed that, and Memphis needed to win two games anyway. However, the Blazers will now strut into their series with the Lakers because of what McCollum showed Saturday when he was bouncy and rolling in the fourth quarter of a tight game. His 29 points and overall presence were a big confidence boost for Portland because not only did he help slay Memphis, but maybe the demons in his aching back as well. McCollum scored eight points in the final 3 1\/2 minutes, including isolating for a pull-up 3-pointer and also a step-back mid-range jumper that were back-breakers for the Grizzlies. On a few late possessions, Lillard \u2014 who supplied so many important fourth-quarter buckets for Portland in the previous three tense games \u2014 surrendered the ball to McCollum; that\u2019s how much confidence Lillard had in his backcourt mate. Lillard said: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s taking a step back and letting somebody else be out front. CJ got going and got rolling. You\u2019ve got to recognize situations like that, take a step back and allow that to happen.\u201d McCollum suffered from an L3 vertebral transverse process fracture (non-displaced) over the last week. He shot 2-for-14 against the Mavericks in his lowest moment. While it\u2019s premature to declare him totally healed and 100 percent healthy, some of the fears of McCollum being hobbled have subsided. Actually, McCollum began to feel frisky the previous game when he scored 25 against the Nets. Before then, the Blazers\u2019 backcourt was heavily imbalanced, with Lillard carrying the team on his, ahem, back for four games. \u201cA healthy CJ is pretty good,\u201d said Blazers coach Terry Stotts. While Lillard gets the applause and franchise tag and this season plenty of MVP talk, all of which is deserved, McCollum\u2019s importance cannot be overstated. The Lillard-McCollum backcourt is one of the league\u2019s finest, and has been for the last four years, with their ability to both create off the dribble and shoot with range making them deadly. Their chemistry is so pure \u2014 helped by their close friendship and absence of jealousy \u2014 that Portland has always resisted any urge to break them apart, despite pleas from a portion of the basketball audience. The theory says Portland can only go so far with a pair of smallish guards who dominate the ball and are average defenders. It\u2019s true that Portland in the Dame-CJ era has only reached the Western Conference finals once, although to be fair, Portland never was the dominant seeded-team or a strong postseason favorite in the Steph Curry Warriors Era and now, the LeBron James-Lakers Era. Still, Lillard believes this is the best all-around and balanced team he\u2019s had in Portland, which means the Blazers are a No. 8 seed only in the figurative sense. Because of that, Lillard says Portland has a renewed spirit and won\u2019t concede anything against the Lakers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight as hard as we did in the bubble to get the eight seed and just go out there to get beat up on,\u201d said Lillard. Meanwhile, Jusuf Nurkic is back after missing the pre-coronavirus portion of the season while recovering from a leg injury. The Bosnian center is coming off a solid stretch of seeding games while carrying the emotional weight caused by the long illness and then recent death of his grandmother from Covid-19. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cShe made me play.\u201d Nurkic did her proud. He had 22 points and 21 rebounds against Memphis while being guarded by a good defender in Jonas Valenciunas. Lillard rates Nurkic as a top-five center in the NBA when healthy. It\u2019s understandable why Lillard shows that much respect; Nurkic provides the low-post scoring that was missing in Lillard\u2019s seven-year career in Portland. Even LaMarcus Aldridge was a mainly a mid-range compliment to Lillard before leaving for the Spurs. The Blazers also return Zach Collins, another big man who played only the first few weeks before separating his shoulder. Collins played sporadically over the last few games, yet could see his playing time increase to match up with the Lakers\u2019 frontcourt. As complete as they may seem right now, the Blazers will go into this series without swingman Trevor Ariza, who opted out of Orlando for family reasons. Ariza is a stretchy defender with quick hands who could have supplied minutes guarding Anthony Davis and perhaps LeBron as well. And Portland is missing Rodney Hood; they signed Carmelo Anthony as his replacement. Still, the main \u201cmissing\u201d piece that Portland rediscovered is McCollum, fresh off a confidence boost. The Blazers haven\u2019t forgotten what McCollum did in Game 7 last spring in Denver, when he scored 37 points and pushed the Blazers to the conference finals. And earlier this year, before the shutdown, he had a pair of 41-point games. \u201cI got a lot left,\u201d said McCollum. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Pelicans fired 65-year-old coach Alvin Gentry on Saturday after the club missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons. New Orleans went 30-42 this season, finishing with just two victories in its final eight games despite the presence of top overall draft choice Zion Williamson and first-time All-Star Brandon Ingram in the lineup until the club was eliminated from playoff contention with two games to play. But David Griffin asserted during a video media conference that a coaching change might have been forthcoming even if New Orleans had rallied to capture one of the Western Conference\u2019s final playoff spots. \u201cThe wins and losses have very little to do with this,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is really about the process. This is about the shared vision of how we\u2019re going to go forward and what this looks like as we build.\u201d While Griffin declined to answer specific questions about potential candidates, he said he expects the club\u2019s coaching search to move deliberately, in part because many candidates are on the staffs of teams that have made the playoffs. \u201cWe will not be quick with this at all. This is not a rush. We have a job that we believe is going to be the most attractive in the NBA,\u201d Griffin said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic also could slow the timeline for a hire because of the importance he places on getting to know candidates face to face. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be done solely via Zoom,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find the right voice with the right group of people that have a shared vision. I would tell you that hiring a head coach is the hardest thing we do from a front office perspective because it impacts every single part of your organization, and it has the biggest impact every day on your players and the culture that you\u2019re trying to build.\u201d Griffin has known Gentry since both worked for the Phoenix Suns from 2004 to 2010, and said the decision to change coaches was \u201creally difficult on a human level.\u201d Griffin also emphasized that Gentry\u2019s coaching ability was never in question. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t forgotten how to coach and this isn\u2019t about any shortcomings that we perceived in that way,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is far more about finding the right fit and a shared vision for a very young and ambitious group moving forward.\u201d The Pelicans had three starters this season \u2014 Williamson, Ingram and Lonzo Ball \u2014 who were younger than 24 and had no playoff experience. Two other regulars \u2014 Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander Walker \u2014 were also 2019 first-round draft choices. And the Pelicans have a slew of draft picks still to come from last year\u2019s trade of Anthony Davis to the Lakers. Gentry went 175-225 since his hiring by former Pelicans general manager Dell Demps after the club fired Monte Williams following the 2014-15 season, when Davis was the face of the franchise. New Orleans made the playoffs in Gentry\u2019s third season, sweeping Portland in the first round before falling to eventual champion Golden State in the second. But the Pelicans were derailed the following season by a combination of injuries and Davis\u2019 trade demand, which precipitated Demps\u2019 firing. Gentry was retained even after Demps was replaced by Griffin and the coach\u2019s contract was extended through the end of next season. But New Orleans faltered once again this season, starting 6-22 and laboring through a franchise record 13-game losing streak while Williamson missed the first 44 games of the season while recovering from knee surgery. The Pelicans rallied back into contention for a playoff berth and were virtually at full health when the season resumed in central Florida late last month after a hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Odds makers favored them to make the playoffs, but losses in four of six after resuming their season eliminated them from playoff contention. \u201cI want to thank Alvin for his contributions to the Pelicans and the New Orleans community,\u201d Pelicans owner Gayle Benson said. \u201cWe believe that making a head coaching change is necessary at this time. I truly appreciate Alvin\u2019s leadership, dedication and perseverance through some challenging circumstances over the past five seasons.\u201d Gentry came to New Orleans from Golden State, where he was a top assistant under Steve Kerr when the Warriors won the 2015 NBA title. New Orleans marked Gentry\u2019s fifth head coaching stop. He also has served as a head coach with Miami, Detroit, the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix, compiling a career coaching record of 510-595. Gentry\u2019s coaching staff remains employed and includes assistant Chris Finch, who Griffin said will be a head coaching candidate for several teams. \u201cWe feel very strongly about the assistant coaching staff,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSome of those individuals potentially will be head coaching candidates elsewhere \u2014 Chris Finch certainly among them.

(AP) \u2014 Luka Doncic would like to clear up a bit of a misconception: He has playoff experience. Then again, he also knows what awaits now is different. For the first time since 1990, the Dallas Mavericks are going to the playoffs without Dirk Nowitzki on the roster. The German great retired after last season, officially passing the torch as leader of the Mavs to Doncic \u2014 the Slovene who nearly averaged a 30-point triple-double in just his second NBA season. So, no, he hasn\u2019t seen what the NBA playoffs are like. There\u2019s also no reason to think Doncic isn\u2019t ready for this stage. \u201cYes, it is the playoffs, but I have been in the playoffs before, just in Europe,\u201d said the 21-year-old Doncic, who was still a teenager when he led Real Madrid to the EuroLeague title and was basically considered the best player in that league two years ago. \u201cIt is not the same level, but it is the same emotions. I am excited for sure.\u201d He should be. Doncic finished the season averaging 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists. The only other players who posted those numbers for a full season are Oscar Robertson, who did it four times, and Russell Westbrook. He led the NBA with 17 triple-doubles. He was an All-Star for the first of what will likely be many times. He was one of two players \u2014 reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks was the only other \u2014 to have season-highs of at least 20 rebounds and 15 assists. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal player and he\u2019s getting better,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cLike, by the hour. By the day.\u201d Doncic\u2019s first playoff series won\u2019t be any cakewalk. The seventh-seeded Mavericks open the Western Conference postseason against the second-seeded Los Angeles Clippers, a team that features reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. The Clippers have legitimate title aspirations \u2014 but they also speak with obvious respect for Doncic. \u201cLuka is going to be a handful,\u201d Clippers guard Lou Williams said. \u201cDallas plays extremely hard. We just saw these guys last week. Well-coached team. When they\u2019re on the court, they\u2019re all going to play hard. \u2026 It will be highly entertaining, a lot of talented guys on the floor.\u201d The Clippers have some of the best defensive players in the NBA: Leonard, Paul George and Patrick Beverley among them. The Mavericks? Behind Doncic, they only assembled the greatest year in NBA history in terms of offensive efficiency. They finished the regular season averaging 116.7 points per 100 possessions, almost a full point ahead of the mark set by Golden State last season. Doncic\u2019s offensive gifts \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are obviously a major factor why Dallas scores with such ease. Carlisle played with Larry Bird. He coached Jason Kidd. He knows elite passing and orchestrating when he sees it, and he\u2019s not afraid to put Doncic in their class. \u201cHe knows where everybody is, not only on offense, but defense,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sign of, you know, a savant-type guy. \u2026 Larry Bird, he could see everything like that. Jason Kidd, he could see everything like that. Luka\u2019s in that same mold. He\u2019s just got a different body type, got a different kind of game, but when he draws when he draws the attention you know somebody\u2019s going to get a wide-open shot.\u201d Case in point: The Pass. That\u2019s all that needs to be said in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble, just \u201cthe pass,\u201d and it\u2019s pretty clear which one is being referenced. Doncic turned in one of the quintessential moments of the seeding games when he offered a perfect bounce pass to Maxi Kleber for a dunk in overtime of a close game against the Milwaukee Bucks. Doncic fired the bounce pass between his legs, and if that wasn\u2019t enough, he threaded it between two of the Bucks\u2019 best defenders \u2014 Eric Bledsoe and defensive player of the year candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cThat\u2019s just who he is,\u201d Mavs forward Kristaps Porzingis said. \u201cHe can make those incredible plays.\u201d And now Doncic gets the chance to make those plays on the NBA\u2019s best stage: The playoffs. \u201cHe\u2019s wired for big moments,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d"},{"id":26422,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/divac-steps-down-kings-general-manager-official-release","date":"2020-08-14","title":"Vlade Divac steps down as Kings general manager","content":" Vlade Divac has stepped down as general manager of the Sacramento Kings and will be replaced on an interim basis by Joe Dumars. The Kings announced the move Friday, a day after they ended their 14th straight season without a playoff berth. That\u2019s the longest active drought in the NBA and one shy of the record. \u201cThis was a difficult decision, but we believe it is the best path ahead as we work to build a winning team that our loyal fans deserve,\u201d Kings owner Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cWe are thankful for Vlade\u2019s leadership, commitment and hard work both on and off the court.

He traded DeMarcus Cousins to New Orleans in 2017 and made the decision to draft Marvin Bagley III second overall in 2018, one spot ahead of Luka Doncic. The Kings went 39-43 in the 2018-19 season, showing progress under coach Dave Joerger. But the team fired Joerger after the season and replaced him with Luke Walton. Sacramento then went 31-41 this season. \u201cIt has been an honor and a privilege to serve as the general manager for the Kings,\u201d Divac said. \u201cI want to thank Vivek for the opportunity and recognize all of the incredible colleagues who I had the great pleasure of working with during my tenure. Sacramento and the Kings will always hold a special place in my heart and I wish them all the best moving forward.\u201d Dumars was hired as a special adviser to Divac last June. He helped build a championship team in Detroit in 2004 and won the executive of the year award in 2002-03. He was replaced as GM by the Pistons after the 2013-14 season. Dumars will help the Kings develop a long-term strategy for their basketball operations department and be part of the search for a full-time general manager. \u201cJoe has become a trusted and valued adviser since joining the team last year, and I am grateful to have him take on this role at an important time for the franchise,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said."},{"id":26434,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/derrick-jones-jr-injury-stretcher","date":"2020-08-14","title":"Derrick Jones Jr. leaves court on stretcher after collision, tests reveal neck strain","content":" Miami Heat forward Derrick Jones Jr. was carted off the court and fitted for a neck brace after colliding with Indiana Pacers center Goga Bitadze late in the third quarter Friday. Jones was trying to get around a screen from Bitadze when he collided with the 6-foot-11 center and fell to the floor. Jones lay on his stomach for several minutes with his right hand over the back of his head. Players from both teams stood on the court in silence as Heat personnel and eventually emergency medical workers tended to Jones. Once the brace was on, they rolled him onto a backboard and lifted him onto a stretcher before wheeling him off the floor. The Heat later diagnosed Jones Jr. with a neck strain following a series of scans and tests. The team added he would be re-evaluated over the weekend. Heat center Bam Adebayo, one of Jones\u2019 closest friends on the team and someone who was not playing in Friday\u2019s game, followed the group of rescue workers off the floor. Jones appeared to have movement in most of his extremities, and was tapping the toes of his sneakers on the court several times while being evaluated.

Each time I walk past room 4165, the love comes my way, right from the front door. That\u2019s where a handful of yellow sticky pads are arranged to form a heart shape, and inspirational messages are scribbled on each pad. This display isn\u2019t meant just for whomever lives inside the room. This is meant for everyone of us on the property, strangers from all over the country thrown together by chance, united in our effort to see the NBA season completed, determined to stay safe and mainly to stay sane. We all share the same challenges no matter our genders, race and faith. You might say we\u2019re sticky-ied together. Is it possible to take this concept to the outside world once we\u2019re done here at Disney? I did something similar for my daughter when she went through major surgeries in high school which threatened to steal her running career. Each week during her rehab, I wrote something inspirational on a sticky and placed it on her bathroom mirror. After four months the mirror was almost covered, save for a small spot in the middle that I spared so she could see her face. She never said anything \u2014 teenagers are weird like that \u2014 but because she left them on the mirror for almost a year, I kinda think she appreciated the gesture. Anyway, we here at Disney appreciate room 4165 for the therapy and giving us a reason for hope. Here are some of the sticky sayings: \u201cHappiness is not in another place, but this place \u2026 not for another hour, but this hour.\u201d \u201cWhat matters isn\u2019t \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad.\u2019 What matters is \u2018Am I better than yesterday?\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat if I fail? Oh but my darling, what if you fly?\u201d \u201cThe bad news is nothing lasts forever. The good news is nothing lasts forever.\u201d \u201cRule No. 1: Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Rule No. 2: It\u2019s all small stuff.\u201d You get the message \u2014 or rather, messages. Too often, and maybe it\u2019s human nature, we dwell on the negative, become buried in pessimism, surrender to our fears, fail to search frantically for solutions and don\u2019t realize how each day and moment brings another chance for something better. This inflicts even the successful folks in life. For example, the NBA is comprised of the best basketball players in the world. However, if they miss 10 straight shots, they\u2019ll likely shy away from taking another, fearing that another miss might not sit well with the coach, their teammates and the creatures on social media. In a time of turbulence where politics and health seem to collide and try to divide us, it\u2019s more important now than ever to seek solutions and a common ground against those and other forces. I\u2019m a big believer that love is much more powerful and present than what we\u2019re led to believe by folks pushing agendas and narratives. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a heart-shape group of stickies on a hotel door that I subscribe to. What\u2019s interesting is there\u2019s also a Do Not Disturb sign hanging on the doorknob right now. I should respect it and give the complete stranger his or her privacy. But I bet if I did knock, that door with the stickies would open. And I would be welcomed inside. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

The organization had been hopeful to find a viable date in October 2020 if the pandemic showed signs of subsiding.

The performances of veteran superstars whose teams had playoff berths already locked up don\u2019t deserve the scrutiny they are sure to receive. For others, however, those eight games served as an opportunity to make a statement and in some cases introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to the rest of the world. These aren\u2019t the superstars who are sure to find their names on one of the Kia NBA All-Seeding Games Teams, though. (And for the record: Go ahead and split the Kia Player of the Seeding Games award between the Suns\u2019 Devin Booker and the Trail Blazers\u2019 Damian Lillard). These eight players are ones who might normally get overlooked. But after their respective efforts in Orlando, they\u2019ve become impossible to ignore. (Players listed in no particular order) * * *  Season restart stats: 22.0 ppg | 8.6 rpg | 1.6 apg | 1.0 s pg Nuggets fans have been waiting to see the Porter Jr. who emerged as a force during the seeding games. He took full advantage of the absence of starters Gary Harris and Will Barton to shove his way into the starting lineup and led the Nuggets in scoring and rebounds while shooting well, too (55.1% overall, 42.2% on 3-pointers and 93.1% on free throws). Even with his suspect defensive work, he\u2019s made it impossible for coach Michael Malone to keep him out of the starting five. Season restart stats: 31.0 ppg | 6.3 rpg | 2.0 apg | 1.3 spg | 1.2 b pg Warren doesn\u2019t care that you didn\u2019t know his name or face before now. After he dropped the first 50-point game in the bubble , his game went viral. He\u2019s done work on every level, shooting 57.8% overall and 52.4% on 3-pointers. The best part is what comes next: the renewal of his budding rivalry with Heat star Jimmy Butler in the first round of the playoffs. Season restart stats: 25.0 ppg | 5.0 rpg | 6.7 apg | 1.5 s pg Injuries have overshadowed LeVert\u2019s steady rise as one of the most underrated scorers in the league. He had the perfect platform in the bubble with the Nets\u2019 biggest stars missing. He put his full arsenal on display in a showdown against Damian Lillard\u2019s Trail Blazers on Aug. 13 . Lillard said it best after LeVert\u2019s potential game-winner bounced off the back of the rim in that game: \u201cCaris LeVert is cold.\u201d Season restart stats: 16.9 ppg | 1.5 rpg | 1.4 apg | 1.1 s pg NBA Summer League is often where we see young players transition from the roster\u2019s fringes to a legitimate rotation player. Trent Jr. used the seeding games to do exactly that. Opinions about his game and potential changed during the past two weeks, when he shot 51.6% overall and 50.7% on 3-pointers, too, during the restart. He came up huge in the Blazers\u2019 seeding games, including the finale in which he hit a key 3-pointer late and exhausted himself trying to defend LeVert down the stretch. Season restart stats: 12.8 ppg | 4.1 rpg | 1.8 apg | 1.1 s pg Devin Booker and Ricky Rubio were the headliners during the Suns\u2019 unbeaten run through the seeding games. But Bridges used the time to show off his game, too. Suns coach Monty Williams put him on Luka Doncic and Kawhi Leonard during crunch time in games against those playoff-bound powers, which says all you need to know about his defensive prowess. Check the tape on Booker\u2019s game-winner against the Clippers and you\u2019ll see Bridges making the play that made it possible. Season restart stats: 30.5 ppg | 9.5 rpg | 2.2 apg | 1.5 bpg The man Kevin Durant dubbed \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d was a force for the Mavericks in the seeding games, leading them in scoring (slightly ahead of Luka Doncic) while also shooting 38.1% on 3-pointers. There\u2019s no questioning the talent of Porzingis, who has the ability to join Doncic on the All-Star team for years to come. What we\u2019re going to find out in the playoffs against the Clippers is if he\u2019s ready to bump and grind against the likes of Montrezl Harrell. If the answer is yes, oh boy \u2026 Bol Bol, Denver Nuggets  Season restart stats: 5.3 ppg | 2.5 rpg We\u2019re stepping out on faith after seeing Bol in limited glimpses, he averaged 11.9 minutes on a loaded frontcourt rotation that also has Porter Jr. and Jerami Grant to work with alongside Jokic and Paul Millsap. But none of them bring the dimensions and skill in the package Bol does. He\u2019s got two-guard tools in his bag and will only get more lethal as his confidence grows. The future frontline of Jokic, Porter Jr. and Bol is an absolute freakshow in the making. Luguentz Dort, Oklahoma City Thunder  Season restart stats: 9.1 ppg | 3.9 rpg | 1.1 spg The undrafted rookie started the season on one of the Thunder\u2019s two-way contracts, earned a starting job by January (the Thunder went 16-5 with him in the starting lineup before the March hiatus) and signed a four-year deal before the action began in the bubble. He\u2019s the sort of junkyard defensive dog the Thunder will need alongside Chris Paul against James Harden and Russell Westbrook in the first round of the playoffs. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

That\u2019s my guess, anyway. No one did more to boost his team, while providing some vital restart emotion and drama. My all-NBA ballot had to be completed without considering the eight seeding games for each team, but I\u2019m doubly glad I had Lillard in my first-team backcourt because it would feel so wrong now given what we\u2019ve just seen. And maybe, what we\u2019ll keep seeing. Shaun Powell :  Damian Lillard was fueled by missing two clutch free throws against the Clippers and hearing about it from Paul George and Pat Beverley and subsequently went on an epic roll. He carried the Blazers those last three games and suddenly was the picture of clutch-ness. Props to Devin Booker for helping Phoenix run the table. John Schuhmann : Damian Lillard by just a hair over Devin Booker. It\u2019s not just that Lillard was the leading scorer in the \u201cbubble\u201d (37.6 points per game). He scored efficiently (his true shooting percentage of 67.7% ranks third among 33 players who have taken at least 100 shots), he averaged 9.6 assists, and had a few of the league\u2019s best defensive teams making things up on the fly because he had to be guarded (sometimes by two guys) as soon as he cross halfcourt. Sekou Smith :  Damian Lillard cannot be denied. He willed the Trail Blazers to the eighth seed with one wicked performance after another, reminding us all that Dame Time is any time he feels like turning it on. As brilliant as he was, though, he\u2019d have to share the hardware with Suns All-Star Devin Booker, who carried his team to the only blemish-free record during the seeding games. The Suns weren\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar before the action kicked off in Orlando and Booker helped change that by showing off every aspect of his game. The rest of the league is on notice moving forward. Michael C. Wright : Devin Booker deserves mention for his performance in leading Phoenix to 8-0 in the bubble. But when Damian Lillard responds from a tough night and a little social-media trash talk from Paul George and Patrick Beverley to light it up for 51 and 61 points in back-to-back games, I\u2019ve got to give the \u2018bubble\u2019 MVP to Lillard . Even outside those games, Lillard put up 30, 45, and 42 points in three more outings. That\u2019s ridiculously high-level production in more than half of Portland\u2019s bubble games."},{"id":26440,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-tougher-first-round-opponent-lakers","date":"2020-08-14","title":"Blogtable: Are Blazers or Grizzlies a tougher first-round foe for Lakers?","content":" * * * Tougher first-round opponent for the Lakers: Portland or Memphis?   * * * Steve Aschburner : Blazers all the way. My only reservation with Portland is that, by the time they get to LeBron James & Co., they could be pretty drained physically and emotionally by the gauntlet of playing their way into and through the play-in mechanism. But Portland as currently constituted \u2014 peak Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony as a third option, healthy Jusuf Nurkic and so on \u2014 is unlike most No. 8 seeds. Now if only they could defend and rebound \u2026 But why nitpick? I\u2019ll enjoy this series as long as it lasts. Shaun Powell :  Well obviously it\u2019s the Blazers, but almost by default. The Grizzlies are inexperienced and shorthanded without Jaren Jackson Jr., while the Blazers went to the conference finals last year and Nurkic and Zach Collins are healthy. However, Portland\u2019s defense is putrid \u2014 not that the Lakers are all that much better \u2014 and CJ McCollum isn\u2019t 100 percent healthy. To quote Paul George, Lillard is getting sent home. John Schuhmann : It has to be Portland , because of how dangerous Lillard has become. He\u2019s shooting 41.6% (that\u2019s an effective field goal percentage of 62.3%) on 9.6 pull-up 3-pointers per game in the restart. He\u2019s also been blowing past bigs when they\u2019ve tried to meet him at the 3-point line. On the other hand, the Blazers might be the ideal opponent for a Lakers offense that ranked 21st offensively in the restart , because Portland\u2019s defense has been terrible. Despite the No. 1 offense in the restart and despite a few teams resting their best players against them, all six of the Blazers\u2019 wins were within five points in the last five minutes . Sekou Smith :  Portland\u2019s experience and depth will no doubt make the Trail Blazers tougher to deal with in a playoff series. Lillard alone should make you nervous, given the way he played during the seeding games. They have to get there and face the Lakers, of course. Surviving the Grizzlies is the first order of business for a team that exhausted every ounce of energy they had to make it to the Western Conference Play-In. You wonder how much juice Portland will have left to battle the top-seeded Lakers. Coach Terry Stotts would have to dig deeper into his rotation than usual, but don\u2019t tell Lillard, McCollum, Nurkic, Carmelo Anthony, Gary Trent Jr. and Co. they don\u2019t have a fighting chance. Michael C. Wright : No knock against Memphis, as it has been exciting to watch this season. But they don\u2019t have much momentum going into the playoffs, having finished 2-6 in the bubble. Most importantly, the Grizzlies aren\u2019t whole with Jaren Jackson out due to a knee injury. Portland, meanwhile, is the opponent that possesses the star power with Lillard (dropped at least 30 points in five outings in the bubble), McCollum and Anthony, not to mention a young emerging talent in Trent Jr. Plus, the Blazers are the healthiest they\u2019ve been all season. They\u2019ll certainly need to be at full strength against the top-seeded Lakers.

Heck, give me best of nine in that series. Feisty Chris Paul vs. the team that dumped him to the Thunder \u2014 that was the sense at the time, before he and his teammates got busy proving people wrong \u2014 should have enough chippiness to last a couple extra games. Russell Westbrook\u2019s absence for \u201ca few\u201d games is an equalizer that will either bring out James Harden\u2019s best or put him on the brink of further reputational damage in terms of winning. I\u2019m also thinking Steven Adams could have a field day against the small ball crew. Shaun Powell :  I favor Clippers-Mavericks not because I smell an upset, but the star-power is intoxicating. Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Luka Doncic make for must-see TV. Doncic is already next-level and coming off a strong last few weeks and his growth is something to behold. However, the Clippers bring a pair of elite defenders in Leonard and George and the switching off on Doncic will create a chess match disguised as a basketball game. John Schuhmann : Even with Russell Westbrook out for (at least) the start of the series, Thunder-Rockets has the most intrigue \u2014 and not just because they made a huge trade last summer. These are two really good teams, capable of winning multiple series in the right circumstances. OKC defended Houston really well this season (Luguentz Dort, if healthy, will get after James Harden), but all three meetings took place before Houston committed to full-time small-ball. The Rockets\u2019 switch-everything scheme will make it tougher for Chris Paul to get to his spot in the pick-and-roll, but their defenders will have a tough time keeping Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder in front of them, and Steven Adams could obviously have a big series on the glass. The Thunder have a lineup that\u2019s been dominant in limited minutes and the Western Conference\u2019s best record since Thanksgiving . The Rockets have a dude averaging an efficient 34.4 points (Harden\u2019s true shooting percentage ranks third among high-usage players) and the second best record (18-12 through Thursday) in games played between the 13 teams over .500. Sekou Smith : Both teams in the Denver-Utah series present an intriguing matchup of Western Conference teams that fancy themselves as threats to break up a potential Lakers-Clippers conference finals showdown. I\u2019m not sure if I buy either one of them being ready for that level of disruption. I need to see them in action against each other before I entertain anything of the sort. But I appreciate the ambition of both the Nuggets and Jazz. Nikola Jokic battling Rudy Gobert and Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going at it should make this series pop. The wild card is what the Nuggets get from Michael Porter Jr., who flashed talent during the seeding games that require anybody dealing with the Nuggets to rewrite his scouting report profile. This series should be wildly entertaining. Michael C. Wright : Oklahoma City-Houston because it looks like it\u2019ll be the most competitive, and it features three future Hall of Fame guards in Harden, Paul and Westbrook (provided he returns in time from his quadriceps injury). The history between that trio with those teams makes the matchup even more compelling. The difference in styles should also be interesting. Westbrook\u2019s injury situation could take some luster of this matchup, but I have a hard time believing he\u2019ll sit out against his former team.

Chicago Bulls Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Arturas Karnisovas announced Friday that Jim Boylen has been relieved of his duties as coach . Boylen came to Chicago as an associate head coach during the 2015-16 season and was named the team\u2019s 23rd head coach on Dec. 3, 2018. During his time at the helm of the Bulls, he compiled an overall record of 39-84 (.317). The only Bulls coach with a worse record than Boylen is Tim Floyd (49-190). Per the team, a coaching search for his replacement will begin immediately. \u201cAfter doing a comprehensive evaluation and giving the process the time it deserved, I ultimately decided that a fresh approach and evolution in leadership was necessary,\u201d Karnisovas said in a statement Friday. \u201cThis was a very difficult decision, but it is time for our franchise to take that next step as we move in a new direction and era of Chicago Bulls basketball. \u201cJim is a great human being that cares deeply about this organization and the game of basketball. I want to thank him for his professionalism and commitment to the franchise.\u201d Chicago was left out of the NBA season restart in Orlando and has missed the playoffs in four of the past five seasons, a tough stretch for a franchise whose dominance in the 1990s was chronicled in the ESPN documentary \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d The Bulls overhauled their front office when they hired Karnisovas as executive vice president of basketball operations in April and Marc Eversley as general manager a few weeks later. As of early June, Karnisovas had not met in person with Boylen. \u201cNo one could question Jim\u2019s passion for our team and our organization,\u201d Bulls President and Chief Operating Officer said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe sincerely appreciate his tireless efforts and contributions during his time with the Bulls, and we wish him and his family the very best.\u201d The Bulls came into the season hoping to contend for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. But the plan did not come to fruition. Chicago was 22-43 before play was stopped in March and quite a bit has changed since the team walked off the court for the final time. John Paxson, a link to the franchise\u2019s glory years, moved into an advisory role after leading basketball operations for 17 years, and Gar Forman was fired as general manager. No matter who is coaching, the Bulls need to get more out of Lauri Markkanen. The 7-footer from Finland averaged 14.7 points and 6.3 rebounds, down from 18.7 and 9.0 the previous season. \u201cI spoke to him about last year,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cHe\u2019s eager to get back to the gym and improve. He was disappointed, obviously, by the overall result. Every player wants to win. He\u2019s about winning, as well. Our objective is to get the best version of Lauri next year.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":26503,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/first-round-playoff-series-preview-celtics-76ers-2020","date":"2020-08-14","title":"Series Preview: Healthy Celtics back among title contenders","content":" They meet again. No two NBA franchises have faced each other in the postseason more than the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, but meeting No. 21 will take place amid unique circumstances. This edition of the great Atlantic Division rivalry will come without the raucous crowds of Beantown and Philly. It will also come without Ben Simmons, who suffered a knee injury in the Sixers\u2019 third seeding game in Orlando. After a lineup change and some revisions to their offense, the Sixers were one of the most intriguing teams in the restart, an underachiever with, perhaps, the highest ceiling among Eastern Conference contenders. But for the third straight season, they enter the postseason at less than 100%. The Celtics were the underachiever last year. But with improved chemistry, improved health, and a star turn from Jayson Tatum, they\u2019re back among the league\u2019s title contenders. With the NBA\u2019s deepest group of two-way wings, Boston was the only Eastern Conference team that ranked in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. The offense wasn\u2019t so great against the Sixers, who won three of four regular-season meetings. Without Simmons, the Sixers still have the best player in the series, a capable supporting cast (including one guy from that underachieving Celtics team of last season), and only slightly less intrigue than they had prior to the restart. 1. How much will Simmons\u2019 absence affect the Sixers\u2019 offense? Simmons\u2019 defensive impact is obvious; He led the league in steals (2.1) and ranked third in deflections (3.9) per game. Plus, he was the Sixers\u2019 primary defender against Tatum (see below). Offensively, Simmons in the open floor gives the Sixers some easy points that they can\u2019t get otherwise. They averaged 12.3 fast break points per 36 minutes with him on the floor and only 7.2 per 36 with him off it. But without him, the Sixers are able to simplify their half-court offense and put four shooters on the floor around Embiid in pick-and-rolls or in the post. While the Sixers scored 109.6 points per 100 possessions in 408 minutes with Simmons and Embiid on the floor without Al Horford, they\u2019ve scored 113.3 per 100 in 174 minutes with Horford and Embiid on the floor without Simmons. 2. Is Kemba Walker ready? It was worrisome when, after a 20-week layoff, the Celtics were still being careful with Walker. The guard was still recovering from a left knee injury that kept him out of six of their 10 games between the All-Star break and the hiatus. But Walker played in six of the eight seeding games and had his best performance ( 19 points on 7-for-10 shooting in 28 minutes) against Memphis on Tuesday, saying afterward that he felt \u201cprobably the best I\u2019ve felt out there.\u201d He didn\u2019t get to the basket as much as he did prior to the All-Star break, but he shot 8-for-10 from mid-range and 15-for-34 from 3-point range (not including an end-of-quarter heave). He\u2019s probably not yet full strength, but the postseason outlook appears better than it did two weeks ago. 3. So the Celtics are full strength? And with good timing. After having all of their top five perimeter players for just 14 of their 64 pre-hiatus games, the Celtics had all five for six of their eight seeding games, with the exceptions being days of intentional rest (Walker sat the second game of a back-to-back and all five were held out of the final game). The Celtics are just 13-7 with all five players available, and that includes an 0-2 mark against the Sixers. But they\u2019ve outscored their opponents by 9.8 points per 100 possessions with at least two of the five on the floor and will likely shorten the rotation going forward. Marcus Smart struggled offensively in the seeding games (shooting 9-for-39 over his last six), but the Celtics always have more guys who can get buckets when one or two go cold. 24:23 \u2014 No player defended Jayson Tatum this season more than Ben Simmons , who guarded the Celtics\u2019 young All-Star for 24 minutes and 23 seconds, according to Second Spectrum tracking. And when Simmons was guarding him, Tatum shot just 5-for-16 (1-for-9 on 2-point shots, 4-for-7 on 3s). With Simmons recovering from knee surgery, the Sixers will need a new primary defender on Tatum, who shot just 33% in the season series overall. The 106.9 points per 100 possessions the Celtics scored against Philly was Boston\u2019s worst mark against any Eastern Conference opponent , though that breaks down to 117.8 per 100 in the two meetings in Boston and just 96.5 in the two meetings in Philly (one of which was the first game of the season). \u2014 John Schuhmann The Sixers are without one All-Star, but they still have a huge matchup advantage with the other. If Embiid is healthy and can stay out of foul trouble, Philadelphia is dangerous. Embiid struggled a bit (shooting 18-for-46) in three games against the Celtics this season, but the absence of Simmons could give him more catches in the paint and more room to operate when he makes those catches. And even if he struggles to score, so will the Celtics. Boston scored just 94 points per 100 possessions in the seven-footer\u2019s 83 minutes on the floor (vs. 113 in his 109 minutes off the floor) in the season series. Alas, Embiid can\u2019t play 48 minutes and it\u2019s not clear if he\u2019ll be at or near 100% at when the series starts Monday. The Celtics will have matchup advantages elsewhere, and while Embiid will keep them from getting to the basket, no team has shot more effectively on pull-up jumpers.

Sometimes an individual or a group gets overlooked through no fault of their own, and draws motivation from a burning desire to prove its critics wrong. That would be the Miami Heat in this first-round Eastern Conference series. Miami, always driven and well-coached, surpassed most modest expectations for this season, coalescing quickly around sign-and-trade addition Jimmy Butler. A team that typically plays with an edge anyway added an alpha dog and, different from Butler\u2019s previous stops in Chicago, Minnesota and Philadelphia, set up a deep, versatile pecking order behind him. Outscoring foes by about one 3-pointer and one free throw nightly, flexing two Miami strengths, helps too. Another kind of overachieving team is one that has every excuse put in front of it to fail, yet ignores them. That\u2019s the Indiana Pacers, who have dealt with serious injury absences or rust \u2014 183 games missed overall and 21 different starting lineups, heading into their seeding-game finale \u2014 as if they\u2019ve been a bit of indigestion through which to push. It\u2019s a tribute to coach Nate McMillan and his staff for creatively plugging holes by fiddling with matchups and styles. The overachieving, however, stops here for one of these East grinders. 1. How many Pacers injuries are too many? It probably would be easier to list the important Indiana guys who haven\u2019t missed significant time, considering the bug has afflicted Victor Oladipo, Jeremy Lamb, Malcolm Brogdon, Myles Turner, JaKarr Sampson and others. But the playoffs are no time to have key guys hobbling or missing. That\u2019s the case with big man Domantas Sabonis (plantar fasciitis, left foot), a starter and All-Star this season who looks like he won\u2019t be finishing . Keep an eye on T.J. Warren, one of the bubble\u2019s break-outs, who has been coping with plantar fasciitis in his right foot.  2. Will the Jimmy Butler-T.J. Warren feud be a thing? Even if Warren is able to keep logging heavy minutes, he might find it hard to put up the sort of scoring numbers that grabbed folks\u2019 attention early in the restart. That leftover beef from January between the two feisty forwards tipped in Butler\u2019s favor Monday when they finally faced each other again, Warren shooting 5-for-14 in a 22-point defeat. The theatrics might not play out the way they did in the winter, but the Heat will be able to tailor their defense vs. Warren night after night, with Butler as the tip of that spear. So the answer is probably no and yes.  3. Is this any way for a top rookie to finish his season? Kendrick Nunn already has been tabbed as a finalist for the Kia Rookie of the Year balloting and might end up as high as No. 2 (nobody\u2019s beating Memphis guard Ja Morant). Like most rookies, Nunn has nearly a full, elongated season under his belt and should be ready to shed the status. At 15.2 points per game and 35.6% 3-point shooting, Nunn was a valued surprise for Miami. But Nunn got sick, had to re-quarantine and fell out of sync with his team. In no time, coach Erik Spoelstra had shifted to a starting lineup of Goran Dragic, Jimmy Butler, Duncan Robinson, Jae Crowder and Bam Adebayo, with Tyler Herro probably first off the bench. Nunn almost will have to earn his minutes all over again. Nice problem for a team to have, though.  38.1% \u2014 The Heat led the league in 3-point percentage at 38.1%, having seen the biggest jump from last season, when they ranked 21st (34.9%). Duncan Robinson, who ranked fourth in individual 3-point percentage (44.8%) and third in 3s per game (3.8), has been the biggest part of the improvement and terrorizes opposing defenses with his movement and aggressiveness. The rotation also includes four non-threats \u2014 Bam Adebayo (2-for-14), Jimmy Butler (24.4%), Andre Iguodala (29.8%) and Derrick Jones Jr. (28.0%) \u2014 from beyond the arc. But Miami has other dangerous shooters, including Kelly Olynyk (41.2%), Tyler Herro (39.0%) and Jae Crowder, who went from shooting 29.3% from 3-point range with Memphis to 44.5% after getting traded to the Heat. \u2014 John Schuhmann Miami won the first three meetings heading toward the series finale Friday. Average margin of victory: 12.3 ppg. The Heat can stretch Indiana\u2019s thinned defense and roster in a couple of ways: Flaunting a league-leading accuracy from the arc (38.1%) and doing what it takes to get to the foul line (Miami is No. 1 in free-throw rate). Miami has controlled the Pacers on the boards, too. For example, allowing them only eight offensive boards in three games. With Sabonis, a rust-free Oladipo and a springy Warren, this could be a coin-flip seven-gamer. Not now. Heat in 5.  * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 Luke Walton was trying to find the right words to motivate his players to finish the season strong. The Sacramento Kings had been eliminated from playoff contention, which was nothing new for the team with the NBA\u2019s longest streak of missing the postseason. Yet, even players who\u2019d spent their whole careers with the organization had never heard the type of speech their coach made this week. This wasn\u2019t the normal talk of playing for pride, of trying to make an impression for next season. \u201cHe said something like, \u2018We don\u2019t know when the basketball is going to come back after this time,\u2019\u201d guard Bogdan Bogdanovic said. The 22 teams who qualified for the NBA\u2019s restart will be down to 16 by the end of the weekend, when the playoff bracket is set. The other six clubs exit World Disney World the same way as tourists who normally pack the place. Their fun is over. Now it\u2019s back to the real world, and the real world in 2020 is an unsettling place. \u201cThe unknown, none of us like that,\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said. Uncertainty awaits at the end of every season for teams that miss the playoffs. Coaches might not be retained. Free agents may not be re-signed. This time, though, the questions go far beyond simple basketball matters. The coronavirus pandemic forces teams to wonder whether they will be safe, and when \u2014 or where \u2014 they might be back together again. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re leaving the happiest and safest place on earth and it\u2019s definitely going to be tough, but it\u2019s also going to be exciting because we all get to see our families and that\u2019s what we miss the most,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what the next step is going to be.\u201d NBA teams have been on campus since early July and there has not been a player test positive for the coronavirus during that time. Meanwhile, the virus has raged on elsewhere in the U.S., strengthening in some places as the number of cases in the country soared past 5 million. More than 750,000 have been killed worldwide and there have been more than 20 million known infections. With only a limited number of people allowed inside the bubble and a commitment among them to making sure it worked, players could count on a safe environment. They were tested daily and reminders about mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing were so ubiquitous that Brooks said the Wizards could pretty much memorize the video the league gave them. \u201cHonestly, the NBA\u2019s done a great job,\u201d New Orleans guard Jrue Holiday said. \u201cThis has been the safest place on earth. Seriously, the safest place on earth.\u201d Players aren\u2019t assured of that security now. Mask wearing isn\u2019t required in some places, not enforced in others. A common commitment to following medical recommendations is one of the reasons the U.S. has struggled so badly to slow the spread of the virus in the first place. Walton said there is obvious concern for those already gone or on their way out of Florida. \u201cAnd I think one of the biggest challenges for us who have been in this bubble \u2014 there\u2019s been zero positive tests and it\u2019s been such a safe and natural movement going on throughout here \u2014 (is) readjusting to what\u2019s happening outside of the bubble,\u201d he said. The Kings\u2019 Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, Alex Len and Jabari Parker had already tested positive before the restart, so the Kings know the dangers of the virus. Walton said his players will need to continue following the same precautions they did while at Disney. But there are still basketball issues. A December start has been targeted for the 2020-21 season and the NBA would love for it to be in home markets with fans in the arenas, but those are far from guaranteed. Teams won\u2019t be able to prepare for it in normal ways, not while they\u2019re still limited to voluntary workouts in their facilities. \u201cA lot of the offseason is normally based on player development, where you send coaches all over the country to work with your guys every day,\u201d Walton said. \u201cAnd a lot of that won\u2019t be able to happen and we won\u2019t know a start date for who knows how long.\u201d Concerns about the unknown, Walton noted, are being faced by people all over the world. NBA teams have been shielded for a little while, but the Pelicans, Kings and Wizards, and soon more teams, have lost that now. They will miss out on more than playoff bonus money. They will miss the comforts of campus, the place where they had all the answers. And for a young team like the Pelicans, who already had to learn NBA life in the strangest season ever, the offseason could be even more challenging. \u201cStill kind of getting used to this league,\u201d Holiday said of his teammates, \u201cdefinitely in a weird year which I feel like nobody\u2019s ever really dealt with this before, or even what\u2019s going to happen in the foreseeable future.\u201d"},{"id":26511,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10-bubble-surprises","date":"2020-08-14","title":"10 Bubble Surprises: Lillard's new level, shocking Suns headline seeding games","content":" Uncertainty teemed when the NBA announced plans to resume the season, only to be met with resounding success and gripping storylines, as we finally round the bend approaching the start to the postseason . This list certainly isn\u2019t all-encompassing. We\u2019ve all gleefully gawked at plenty of great moments at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World resort. Still, here\u2019s an attempt to capture 10 of the biggest surprises we\u2019ve seen so far from the bubble: 1. Damian Lillard. There are multiple surprises rolled up in this one. There\u2019s Lillard\u2019s reaction to comments and taunts from Paul George and Patrick Beverley, after falling short in an Aug. 8 loss to the L.A. Clippers. Lillard missed a pair of free throws with Portland trailing by only one point with 18 seconds left to play, and then fired an off-target potential game-tying 3-pointer. From the bench, Beverley laughed and taunted Lillard, before taking to social media along with Paul George to rub it in deeper Bad move. Lillard responded the next day by dropping 51 points for the first time since Feb. 1 to go with seven assists in a win over Philadelphia, only to top that Tuesday by pouring in a career-high-tying 61 points and eight assists during a 134-131 win over the Dallas Mavericks that moved Portland into eighth in the Western Conference standings. The performance marked Lillard\u2019s third game this season in which he racked up 60 points or more, placing him in the elite company of Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to put together three games or more with 60 points or more in one season. To seal the deal and Portland\u2019s play-in spot, the five-time All-Star poured in 42 points and 12 assists in the Blazers\u2019 134-133 win over Brooklyn. The performance included another 3-pointer from near halfcourt, part of Portland\u2019s fourth-quarter rally to clinch a shot at the postseason. \u201cI told you, when I first came here, I said I didn\u2019t come here to waste my time,\u201d Lillard told TNT sideline reporter Chris Haynes after the game. \u201cThey gave us a chance to get in like we asked for. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. The job still ain\u2019t done. But I said, \u2018you know what I\u2019m here for.\u2019\u201d Sneakerheads and Lillard fans everywhere received yet another surprise Wednesday when Adidas discounted all of the Portland star\u2019s signature shoes to $61 to commemorate the 61-point performance. Those kicks normally retail in the $100 range. 2. The shining Phoenix Suns. Sometimes, it\u2019s good to be wrong. Right before the NBA restart, Suns beat writer Duane Rankin from the Arizona Republic hit up a bunch of national reporters to get a feel for what we thought of Phoenix\u2019s postseason prospects. Here\u2019s part of what I told him:  \u201cI\u2019m not expecting much because they haven\u2019t spent enough time together in the bubble to go into the actual restart with any real sense of cohesion.\u201d Wrong, but that\u2019s certainly no surprise. The surprise is just how well they\u2019ve played, demolishing a shorthanded Mavericks team on Thursday to finish 8-0 in the seeding games. The shocking stretch wasn\u2019t enough to earn a Western Conference play-in spot, but it more than hints at better times to come. We\u2019ve always known Devin Booker to be a star, but he\u2019s improved even more as a scorer, facilitator, playmaker and clutch performer, and he\u2019s taken steps defensively as well. Add that to the strides we\u2019re seeing from Deandre Ayton inside, and out on the wings with Cameron Johnson and Mikal Bridges, and it appears we\u2019ll be talking about these Suns as a legitimate playoff contender for years to come. It\u2019s clear Monty Williams, with his quick-decision system, and teaching approach is the right coach to lead the Suns into a ridiculously bright future. 3. Keeping it real goes right for the San Antonio Spurs: The organization painted a clear picture from the beginning, given its long odds of actually advancing to the postseason for what would have been an NBA-record 23rd consecutive year. Missing three starters in Bryn Forbes (quadriceps), Trey Lyles (appendectomy) and second-leading scorer LaMarcus Aldridge (shoulder), the Spurs entered the NBA bubble looking to develop its young players while advancing causes for social justice and racial equality. Then, a weird thing happened. They won. Asked how he would\u2019ve reacted to being told last month that his young, developmental players would go into the final seeding game with a real chance to make the postseason, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich quipped: \u201cI would\u2019ve had them drug tested.\u201d That\u2019s how well San Antonio\u2019s youngsters have performed, led by 20-year-old rookie Keldon Johnson, as well as Derrick White, Lonnie Walker IV, and Dejounte Murray with veteran DeMar DeRozan holding everything together. In fact, Popovich even sat down Patty Mills, a veteran leader and the longest-tenured player on the team, because he wants to preserve the guard for next season. \u201cWe had the three starters out, but we decided to sit Patty and part of that is you have to be realistic,\u201d Popovich explained before Tuesday\u2019s 123-105 over the Houston Rockets. \u201cI don\u2019t think our chances at winning a championship were great at the beginning of this, nor are they now. If that\u2019s a fact, then you need to do everything you can to develop and be prepared for next season. With three starters out, sitting Patty made sense, and the development has been off the charts. We\u2019re thrilled with it. It\u2019s a win-win, no matter what. We\u2019ve already accomplished what we thought we were capable of accomplishing, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. If we got in now, it\u2019d be icing on the cake.\u201d Unfortunately for the Spurs, it didn\u2019t play out that way, as wins Thursday by Ph oenix and Memphis extinguished those hopes before they even hit the court to face the Utah Jazz in what would turn out to be their final game of the year. 4. Jacque Vaughn and the Brooklyn Nets: At one point, you half-wondered whether Brooklyn would have enough healthy bodies to even play games in Orlando. Missing stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving as well as Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAndre Jordan, Taurean Prince, Wilson Chandler and rookie Nic Claxton due to either injuries or COVID-19, the Nets managed to lock up the seventh seed, knocking off Milwaukee and the L.A. Clippers along the way. Shoot, the Nets even signed Michael Beasley as a replacement player, but he left the NBA bubble after testing positive for coronavirus. So, the team Brooklyn took to Walt Disney World looked quite a bit different than the one Vaughn inherited back in March when he took over as interim head coach for Kenny Atkinson. \u201cAs far as preparation going into the bubble, it\u2019s two-pronged a little bit,\u201d Vaughn explained. \u201cI think the first part of it was, as a coaching staff, we wanted to give the guys something they could hold on to, something that looked a little different, something that you could press the refresh button on and something new would come on the page. So there was a beginning project that started that looks different than now just because as things developed we didn\u2019t have the team that we assumed we were gonna have, and got to a position where we regrouped as a staff and said, \u2018Well, how can we put these guys in the best position to succeed with the personnel?\u2019 So, knowing some of the guys that we had whether that was Caris [LeVert], JA (Justin Anderson), Joe [Harris], TLC (Timothe Luwau-Cabarrot), Jarrett [Allen], some of those guys that we knew were going to be with us, to the guys that were integrated into the group later on, we really streamlined things, and really allowed players to play with confidence.\u201d Since taking over the Nets, Vaughn owns a record of 7-2 going into their final game in the bubble, and is reportedly under serious consideration for the job on a full-time basis, along with a host of other candidates . From this vantage point, Vaughn has earned the job under extremely extenuating circumstances. It\u2019s time to lift that \u201cinterim\u201d tag. 5. Beale Street blues. The Memphis Grizzlies entered the NBA bubble confident, with a 3 1\/2 -game lead for the eighth spot in the West. Two weeks later, they\u2019re out. We didn\u2019t see that coming. Memphis dropped its first four seeding games, including the first three to teams chasing the Grizzlies for that last spot, on the way to a 2-6 restart record. The situation was only confounded on Aug. 4 when Memphis lost Jaren Jackson Jr. for the season due to a torn left meniscus. Still, Memphis fought its way to a spot in the play-in game with Thursday\u2019s win over the Milwaukee Bucks, which hit the court without reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, as he was suspended . 6. Pelicans struggle in the bubble. Like the Grizzlies, New Orleans entered the bubble as one of the favorites to seize the eighth seed given its young, talented roster and a healthy rookie star in Zion Williamson. New Orleans finished the first half of the seeding games at 1-3, and by Sunday, the Pels had been officially eliminated from the playoffs after a loss to the Spurs coupled with Portland\u2019s win over the 76ers. The very next day, the team ruled out Williamson, Jrue Holiday and Williamson for Tuesday\u2019s 112-106 loss to Sacramento for what coach Alvin Gentry called \u201cprecautionary\u201d reasons. Playing Williamson more during the restart probably could\u2019ve helped. But the Pels made the right move to limit his minutes. No need to jeopardize Williamson\u2019s bright NBA future for what likely would\u2019ve been an early postseason exit anyway. 7. The defending champions are still the defending champions. So maybe it\u2019s not really that much of a surprise that Toronto picked up right where it left off when the NBA season resumed. When COVID-19 shut down the league in March, the Raptors were on a four-game winning streak. They followed that up by winning their first three games of the NBA restart, including two quality wins over contenders in the Lakers and the Heat. Going into Wednesday\u2019s win over Philadelphia, the Raptors owned the top defensive rating of all the teams in the bubble, giving up 99.5 points per 100 possessions. If there\u2019s any surprise regarding the Raptors, it\u2019s the fact they haven\u2019t missed a beat since the departure of two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. 8. @NBABubbleLife. Shout out to Travonne Edwards, Nick DePaula, Drew Ruiz and Wells Phillips for creating the Twitter account that we\u2019re all following. It\u2019s already got more than 130,000 followers. These guys set out create a fun, yet positive experience by aggregating the social media feeds of the players inside the NBA bubble, and they pulled it off flawlessly. Every day you can catch somebody out there doing something different, whether it\u2019s Carmelo Anthony receiving the game ball after moving into 15th on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, Kristaps Porzingis taking a nap , or Kyle Kuzma taking a tee shot . 9. Were the Lakers playing possum? They own the top seed in the West, but the Lakers finished with a 3-5 record in the NBA bubble. They\u2019ve definitely faced tough competition, with their first two games coming against the Clippers and the Raptors. But you have to wonder whether the Lakers are just taking it easy, having already locked up the top spot by Aug. 3 with a win over the Utah Jazz. Then, you wonder whether the Lakers can simply just turn it back on when the stakes are highest in the playoffs. Sure, they\u2019re a veteran group with plenty of big-game experience. But going into their win Monday over the Denver Nuggets, the Lakers ranked last in field goal percentage (41.1). After the game, LeBron James was asked whether his team is ready for the postseason. \u201cI don\u2019t think our team is there, but we will be,\u201d James said. \u201cThere\u2019s a different mindset that you have to be in, but you don\u2019t want to jump into it until you actually get there because it takes a lot of energy, a lot of effort. Once we know who we\u2019re playing, then you start to lock in on your opponent. But you build good habits along the way. We have the habits. If the playoffs started tomorrow, we would be ready for them. But as far as the mental side, you can\u2019t really lock into your opponent until you know your opponent. There\u2019s another level to playoff basketball. But we\u2019ve worked our habits throughout the whole season, and we\u2019re prepared ourselves for the playoffs. We\u2019ll be ready for it when it comes.\u201d We\u2019ll see. The Lakers surrendered the most points (136) since Jan. 20 in a loss to the Kings on Thursday to close out the regular season. 10. The bubble is working. Don\u2019t get it twisted. Before teams departed to Orlando for the NBA\u2019s restart, a couple of team executives and players quietly expressed skepticism about the potential effectiveness of the league\u2019s bubble environment. So, it comes as a pleasant surprise for many to see the league pull off such an undertaking with so few hiccups. The NBA announced on Wednesday that of the 342 players tested for COVID-19 on its campus since testing results were last announced on Aug. 5, zero came back positive. With the league gearing up to allow family members and close friends inside the bubble by the end of the month, the challenge of keeping everyone safe becomes more daunting. * * * Michael C.

Memphis feels that way because it had a 3 1\/2 game lead entering the season restart until it collapsed and relinquished it to Portland. Meanwhile, the Blazers were in the 2019 Western Conference finals and so, while there were legit reasons for this year\u2019s slide, their pride says they shouldn\u2019t even be in this position. It\u2019s interesting how the teams have swapped places, injury-wise. Portland was missing Jusuf Nurkic all season and Zach Collins since the first week of the season with injuries, but both are back in the lineup. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies are without Jaren Jackson Jr., who injured his knee last week and is done for the season. The reversal of fortune seems to favor Portland, although the Blazers have hardly looked dominant in Orlando even against lesser teams. Portland is bringing basketball\u2019s hottest scorer in Damian Lillard, yet plenty depends on the pain tolerance of CJ McCollum, who\u2019s reportedly dealing with a fractured back and isn\u2019t 100%. Normally the Blazers would boast a stellar 1-2 backcourt punch, but now they\u2019ll rely somewhat on backup Gary Trent Jr. to assume some of McCollum\u2019s minutes and role. Per Play-In rules, the Grizzlies, by virtue of being the ninth seed, must beat the Blazers twice to advance. 1. Can Dame keep this up? The greatest August player in NBA history burned through massive minutes and assumed quite a load for the Blazers, who struggled through three victories despite Dame going scorched earth. Every night was a playoff game for Dame, the restart scoring leader, and now he needs to play one more like it, or two if necessary, in order to reach the real playoffs. Plus, he\u2019ll need to chase Ja Morant on the other end, no easy feat. 2. How do the Grizzlies compensate for the loss of Jackson? Triple-J was an important piece of the equation and a solid pick-and-roll weapon with Morant. Now Memphis must use the big-man hybrid of Gorgui Dieng and Anthony Tolliver to plug that hole. Neither was a big factor during much of the season, but Tolliver can stretch the floor and Dieng has rim-protecting instincts. 3. What\u2019s wrong with Portland\u2019s defense? In five of their eight seeded games, the Blazers allowed 124 or more points and spotted Memphis 135 in an overtime win. To put it mildly, the Blazers are not going very far in the playoffs, if they get there, with such spotty play at the other end of the floor. Dame can erupt for 30 or 40 or even 50 points, yet if the Blazers get repeatedly victimized defensively, at some point his heroics will be in vain. Hassan Whiteside is Portland\u2019s best defender but his minutes are reduced with Nurkic back in the starting lineup. 8 \u2014 All eight of the Blazers\u2019 restart games, including their July 31 overtime win over the Grizzlies, have been within five points in the last five minutes . With Lillard averaging a bubble-high 37.6 points per game , the Blazers had the No. 1 and most-improved offense in the restart. They scored 122.5 points per 100 possessions, 10.5 more than they scored before the hiatus, getting more than 16 points per game from four guys beyond Lillard. But the Blazers didn\u2019t get enough stops to make any of their games uninteresting. They ranked 20th defensively in the restart , allowing more than 120 points per 100 possessions. They protected the rim OK, but allowed their opponents to shoot 43.3% from 3-point range and they ranked 19th in opponent free throw rate (32 attempts per 100 shots from the field). Their loss to the Blazers was the Grizzlies\u2019 second best offensive performance (135 points on 114 possessions) of the restart, but their leading scorer was Jackson Jr. (33 points on 10-for-22 shooting), who was lost for the season three days later. Jackson\u2019s absence has provided an opportunity for Brandon Clarke, who averaged 24 points ( his highest scoring average against any opponent ) on 19-for-22 shooting against Portland. \u2014 John Schuhmann Narrow escapes against the Sixers, Mavericks and Nets in their last three must-win games suggest the Blazers aren\u2019t contenders by any stretch. But that\u2019s not the point here; they only need to win one against a Grizzlies team that has also struggled. Lillard is on a career scoring roll and he appears to be on a mission, so that alone makes Portland the favorite. Still, the Grizzlies are young, scrappy, fun to watch and play loose, and Morant is desperate for the big stage. Blazers in 2 . * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Spurs were officially ousted when Memphis defeated Milwaukee and Phoenix completed an undefeated eight-game run in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World with a victory over Dallas. Those games went final shortly before San Antonio was playing its final game of the season, against Utah. The Spurs needed the Grizzlies or the Suns to lose to have any chance of getting into the West play-in series that begins Saturday to decide the NBA\u2019s final postseason berth. The 22-year run of playoff spots tied the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 franchise for the longest in NBA history. The 76ers, starting as the Syracuse Nationals before moving to Philadelphia, went to the playoffs every year from 1950 through 1971. With San Antonio out, the longest active postseason streak now belongs to the Houston Rockets. They\u2019ll be in the playoffs for the eighth consecutive year starting next week. This is how long the streak, all of it with Gregg Popovich as head coach of the Spurs, went: David Stern wasn\u2019t even halfway through his 30-year run as commissioner when the Spurs\u2019 streak started. The Charlotte Bobcats \u2014 that\u2019s what today\u2019s Hornets went by then \u2014 were still 6-1\/2 years from playing their first game. Pat Riley was still coaching the Los Angeles Lakers. And now, for the first time since 1981, the playoffs will happen without either Riley or Popovich as head coaches. The Spurs won five championships during the streak. They played 284 postseason games over those years; the only franchises within 100 of that were the Lakers (218), Miami (196) and Boston (192). And the Spurs won 170 playoff games in that span; only seven franchises have more playoff wins in their entire history. All 170 of those wins for the Spurs came under Popovich, a total that gives him more career playoff victories than any two current coaches combined. There were 102 players who got into at least one Spurs playoff game during the streak, including current NBA head coaches Jacque Vaughn, Steve Kerr and Monty Williams. The Spurs came into Disney as playoff long shots and felt the eight games they were guaranteed of playing during the restart would be ways to have young players grow from competition. They made it to the last possible day of contention. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s been a huge success for our team and our young players, the development that we\u2019ve talked about from the beginning,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with what\u2019s gone on here.\u201d He has given the restart rave reviews, both on and off the floor. Popovich \u2014 a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy and the coach of USA Basketball\u2019s men\u2019s national team \u2014 wore a shirt pregame that read \u201cVote Your Life Depends On It.\u201d He has remained outspoken on the need to end racial injustice and police brutality during the Spurs\u2019 time in the bubble, talking about that perhaps as much if not more as he has about basketball. \u201cIt\u2019s important to bring these up, painful as they are,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSome people talk about getting tired of hearing about it. But that\u2019s the point. It has to change.\u201d Spurs: This was the first losing season for the Spurs since 1996-97, the year that Popovich became coach 18 games into the season \u2014 and just before Tim Duncan went San Antonio as the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 draft. Jazz: Mike Conley (right knee soreness) and Rudy Gobert (lower back soreness) were ruled out of the finale. \u2026 The game was meaningless to Utah, which was locked into a first-round matchup against Denver that starts next week."},{"id":26493,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-clippers-and-warriors-launch-voters-win-campaign","date":"2020-08-13","title":"Hawks, Warriors and Clippers announce 'Voters Win' competition","content":" ATLANTA \u2013 The Atlanta Hawks have partnered with the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, the \u2018I am a voter.\u2019 platform and the Good Trouble campaign to launch the \u2018Voters Win\u2019 campaign competition. The Hawks, Warriors, and Clippers will go head-to-head to get the most fans to make a pledge to vote using the platform. \u2018I am a voter.\u2019 is a nonpartisan movement that aims to create a cultural shift around voting and civic engagement by unifying around the central truth: our democracy works best when we all participate. The Good Trouble campaign, launched by Participant, Magnolia Pictures and Color Farm Media, encourages the public to support voting rights. Similar to an 82-game NBA regular season, the competition will take place over the remaining 82 days prior to Election Day. The contest will be broken into four quarters, with updated results of the competition revealed at the end of each quarter, demonstrating which fans have made the most pledges to vote. The last quarter of the \u2018Voters Win\u2019 competition will end on Election Day, November 3, 2020. The competition will mirror an NBA game and feature four quarters, allowing one winner at the end of each. At the end of each quarter, the team that collects the most pledges from fans will receive the John Lewis: Good Trouble Trophy in honor of the civil rights icon who fought for voters rights and served in the United States House Representatives for Georgia\u2019s fifth congressional district from 1987 until his death this past July. The Good Trouble campaign is tied to the documentary, JOHN LEWIS: GOOD TROUBLE , which tells the story of Congressman Lewis\u2019 life. The last quarter of the \u2018Voters Win\u2019 competition will end on Election Day, Nov. 3, 2020. \u201cThe Voters Win competition is a fun way to encourage fans to use their voices and exercise their right to vote.

Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN report Westbrook, who is suffering from a strained quadriceps muscle, could miss at least that much time if not more. Westbrook will not play in Friday\u2019s final seeding game against the Philadelphia 76ers (9 ET, ESPN). He had an MRI on Wednesday that confirmed his injury. Westbrook has been trying to play through the injury during the season restart.

But where Kaepernick\u2019s demonstrations raised awareness, NBA players want their actions to move the needle further. But transforming the widespread embrace for social justice in America from a moment into a movement requires targeting systemic barriers and changing laws, not just mindsets. One target has been voting, with initiatives such as the LeBron James-led More Than A Vote. \u201cWe have some ears,\u201d James said recently, \u201cand we will continue to push the envelope.\u201d Pushing the voting envelope could provide a tangible legacy for today\u2019s socially conscience players who want to transition symbolism into substantive change. According to Pew Research Center, Black voter turnout saw a sizable jump during the 2018 midterm elections to 51.4%, up 10.8 percentage points since 2014. That\u2019s after declining in 2016 for the first time in two decades. More Than A Vote is working to see that trend continue in 2020. So far, the main targets for the group have been helping to restore voting rights of ex-felons and the procurement of arenas in states in which access to voting venues and early voting has been restricted. In states like Florida, for example, More Than A Vote donated $100,000 to local organizations that are helping to pay monies owed by ex-felons who can\u2019t regain their voting eligibility until their fines and restitution are cleared. The arena efforts go toward easing historical cynicism about a system that has tried to keep Black people from the polls and any concerns that a mailed ballot won\u2019t get counted. Teams in Atlanta, Charlotte, Detroit, and Sacramento have already signed on, with secretaries of state in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and New Jersey working to add more. The efforts have inspired NBA players to use both their social media platforms and interview sessions inside the bubble to advocate not only for justice for Breonna Taylor , Ahmaud Arbery,  George Floyd and others, but voting as well. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of power in coming together and voting,\u201d Celtics forward Jaylen Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power in exercising that. We\u2019ve got to use it.\u201d A lot of the efforts in Florida have been to ensure people do just that, though they began before players went inside the bubble. It was back in February that James\u2019 friend and business partner Maverick Carter reached out to Addisu Demissie, a political consultant who ran California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial campaign and Cory Booker\u2019s 2020 presidential bid, with the idea of starting a politics-oriented nonprofit. Those initial discussions were brought to a standstill in March when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Then the world quickly changed in a much different way following the deaths of Taylor, Floyd and Arbery. As the three incidents incited protests and unrest erupted around the country, those initial discussions between Demissie and James\u2019 team soon picked up in earnest. \u201cIt just made it even clearer that this organization needed to exist, A, and B, it crystallized sort of what our mission would be about black political participation and black political empowerment,\u201d Demissie said. James, Carter and others quickly recruited nearly three dozen prominent current and former Black athletes like NBA stars Trae Young and Draymond Green, NFL players Patrick Mahomes and Alvin Kamara and entertainers like Kevin Hart to join the group. It formally launched in June. The group has sought to distinguish itself from past athlete-led efforts by focusing not simply on voting registration, but by eliminating barriers in the voting process. NBA teams like the Orlando Magic have also since announced their own voting initiatives. Dr. Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California, said while symbolic gestures such as having Black Lives Matter emblazoned on NBA courts and statements of social justice on jerseys certainly can support and lead to targeted action, they alone aren\u2019t enough. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as taking direct action,\u201d said Boyd, who has written extensively on the study of race in sports and popular culture. \u201cThe objective of a sports league is always going to be bottom line and profit.\u201d It wasn\u2019t enough for James, who explained his decision not to wear one of the 29 NBA-approved statements on the back of his jersey during the NBA\u2019s restart. \u201cI commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It\u2019s just something that didn\u2019t really seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal,\u201d he said. Len Elmore, who played in the NBA for 10 seasons and teaches a course at Columbia University on athlete activism and social justice in sports, is encouraged by players not relying solely on rhetoric. \u201cYou use the system to your favor, to your benefit. And that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Elmore, who played in the league during the mid-1970s and early 80s and spent time as a broadcaster before going to Harvard Law School and becoming a district attorney in New York. Elmore said More Than a Vote is \u201cone of the more creative and more unprecedented types of actions in the spirit of obtaining social justice. The vote, has been critical over a number of generations ever since the securing of the Voting Rights Act. \u2026 It\u2019s time to use that system as much as anything else.\u201d Demissie said this is just the beginning. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re named More Than A Vote. Voting, is in many ways Step 1,\u201d Demissie said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on in 2020. But once we\u2019re through this election cycle, this organization is going to continue to exist and fight for justice.\u201d"},{"id":26481,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-day-21","date":"2020-08-13","title":"Disney World Diary: NBA referees have passion for Pickleball","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Many years ago, I was a sportswriter based in New York, which is like being a political writer in Washington. It was so long ago that the Knicks were actually good. Yes, that long ago. The All-Star Game was held in Cleveland, the hometown of Knicks tough guy Charles Oakley, who attended the festivities. This obviously put Oak in a good mood, and to show his appreciation, he sent a limo to the All-Star hotel of the New York writers and brought us to his childhood home, where his family treated us well and his mother made a great meal. We arrived, marveling at our great fortune, because as you know the media is so low on the totem pole that we can do jumping jacks under a pregnant ant. We noticed Oakley had disappeared, so we went hunting for our new best friend. We went down in the basement and there was Oak \u2014 sitting at a table with several of his pals, playing a high-stakes card game, all silent, all serious, some wearing wide-brim hats. One of us, I can\u2019t remember who, said: \u201cHey, deal me in.\u201d Suddenly, time stood still. Oak\u2019s pals stopped looking at their cards and turned their heads. And Oak shot us a stare that would kill. We quietly walked back upstairs and, just by chance, the limo was waiting outside.  That was a lesson: Know your audience and know your limits. Which brings me to Pickleball. Every morning as I walk to get tested, I bypass a Pickleball game in progress. Pickleball is a mixture of tennis and table tennis, played on an outdoor court with a net and multiple players, who hit a ball that makes a distinctive \u201cpocking\u201d sound. Thankfully my room isn\u2019t anywhere near the Pickleball court. Sometimes I stare wishfully, wondering if I should get next game. But there isn\u2019t any sign-up sheet and this isn\u2019t just any Pickleball game. This involves the NBA referees, who are locked in and intense. They\u2019re taking their Pickleball seriously and you can tell by the trash talking. The ringleader is Scott Foster, who also happens to be one of the league\u2019s finest referees. Foster is the LeBron James of referee Pickleball, clearly the face of the sport here at Disney, and Foster might be more focused on this championship than LeBron is on that other championship. It goes unspoken that Pickleball here is reserved for the refs, and you can understand. As a group, they might be more universally despised than us media people, which says something. So there\u2019s lots of referee-bonding at Disney \u2014 they jog together, eat together often and can be seen swimming in the pool together. It\u2019s group therapy and the brotherhood is real. Therefore, why would I interfere with that? I know some of them. They all seem like nice men and women. If the average fan had the chance to speak with the refs, they\u2019d be impressed. The players and coaches respect them more than you might imagine. Before tipoff, their conversations are always civil, engaging and often humorous. After tipoff, well, that\u2019s another story. So as I walk to get tested, and hear the noise and grunts and good-natured boasting and the \u201cpocking\u201d sound, there is a territorial line I refuse to cross. Just as the locker room belongs to the players and I\u2019m only a visitor, Pickleball at Disney belongs to the refs and I\u2019m only a bystander. I do not want \u201cthe Oakley stare.\u201d My feet keep moving. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 The NBA playoff bracket is nearly set. East Bucks- Magic Raptors-Nets Celtics-76ers Heat-Pacers West Clippers-Mavericks Thunder-Rockets Nuggets-Jazz Wednesday\u2019s results filled in five of what were the six unknown matchups for Round 1 of the postseason, which starts next week at Walt Disney World. In the Western Conference: Houston and Oklahoma City will meet in the first round, meaning Rockets guard Russell Westbrook and Thunder guard Chris Paul get the chance to face their former teams. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting,\u201d Paul said. \u201cTwo teams that know a lot about each other. We\u2019ll prepare, get ready and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s what.\u201d Other West matchups that got clinched on Wednesday include the second-seeded Los Angeles Clippers against No. 7 Dallas, and No. 3 Denver against No. 6 Utah. In the East, Miami and Indiana will meet in the first round \u2014 after the clubs close the regular season on Friday against one another to decide which team will be seeded No. 4 and which will be No. 5. Indiana\u2019s win over Houston on Wednesday set what had been the last two unknown series on the East bracket. No. 3 Boston will play No. 6 Philadelphia in a meeting between longtime rivals, and the Pacers are now locked into an East opening series against the Heat \u2014 with the potential of those teams playing nine times in a span of 10 games. Miami beat Indiana on Monday. The teams meet again Friday then face off in Game 1 to begin a best-of-seven series early next week. That means, for just the second time since 2011, teams that end the regular season against one another will open the postseason against one another. The last time it happened was 2016, when Cleveland faced Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that we play them,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cJust need to figure out what uniform we\u2019re wearing.\u201d That will be decided Friday, when home-uniform advantage gets decided. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to match Miami\u2019s energy,\u201d Indiana\u2019s Edmond Sumner said. \u201cThat\u2019s a team that\u2019s going to play hard for 48 minutes.\u201d The other East matchups were known previously: No. 1 Milwaukee plays No. 8 Orlando, and No. 2 Toronto plays No. 7 Brooklyn. In the West, Houston and Oklahoma City will be in the 4-5 matchup and Utah will be the No. 6 seed. The Jazz were locked into that slot by the Thunder defeating Miami, and Denver became the No. 3 seed when they lost to the Clippers. The full list of matchups won\u2019t be known until at least Saturday, when the West play-in series begins with Portland, Memphis, Phoenix and San Antonio bidding for those two spots. The winner of that series will take on the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, the only matchup that\u2019s yet to be determined."},{"id":26465,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/joel-embiid-exits-game-right-hand-injury","date":"2020-08-13","title":"Joel Embiid exits with right hand injury, sits out second half","content":" Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid suffered a right hand injury in the first half Wednesday night against the Toronto Raptors and did not return.

Then, the hard part for the survivor: The Los Angeles Lakers are next. The San Antonio Spurs, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies are angling to emerge victorious in the NBA\u2019s first-ever Play-In game, which will determine the eighth seed for the playoffs that begin Aug. 17. All four have positioned themselves for the chance to extend their season and their stay in Orlando and all the benefits that come with being in the postseason. But which team would give the top-seeded Lakers the toughest time? By virtue of having the low seed, any of the four will enter the first round at a disadvantage against LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers have flexed all season and while they haven\u2019t been at their best during the seeding games, they had nothing to lose \u2014 unlike the four teams fighting for the chance to play L.A. Here\u2019s a look at each of the eighth-seed candidates, their experience at the Disney campus and how they\u2019d compare to the Lakers if given the chance: Portland is clearly the favorite among the four teams and in a best-case scenario would not only give the Lakers a run, but could beat the Lakers in a best-of-seven should they get a few breaks. The Blazers have talent at every position and a decent supply of bench players. If you placed their hand on a Bible, the Lakers would confess that Portland is the team they\u2019d rather not see. The Blazers are bringing the hottest player in basketball right now. Damian Lillard appears to be on a mission. Dame went next-level in his last two games, combining for 111 points and carrying the club through a pair of intense and suspenseful outcomes that fell in Portland\u2019s favor. Dame has reached the Western Conference finals once in his career, and facing a title contender in the first round wouldn\u2019t exactly be the easiest of paths to return to the conference finals. But, he appears up to the task. He\u2019s one of two players on the Blazers\u2019 roster who feel extra motivated to make a serious run. The other is Carmelo Anthony, another ring-less star whose career is on the clock. \u2018Melo also was ignored by the Lakers during the season when he was unemployed and the Lakers could\u2019ve made room for a player who would\u2019ve taken the minimum. Also, the Blazers have size to compete with the Lakers big men (LeBron and Davis included in this mix). Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins have healed from their injuries and should give Portland a rim presence that it missed all season. Here\u2019s the biggest problem with Portland: The Blazers\u2019 defense has been spotty \u2014 same with the Lakers \u2014 and CJ McCollum is reportedly dealing with a lower back issue. The McCollum issue is concerning because the Blazers normally would have a backcourt advantage, especially with Avery Bradley sitting out the Orlando trip for the Lakers. No LaMarcus Aldridge, no major problem so far for the Spurs (6-2 in restart), who\u2019ve used a collective effort to minimize the absence of their primary scorer and rebounder to position themselves for a takeover of the No. 8 seed. You can never easily dismiss a team coached by Gregg Popovich, so here are the Spurs, underachieving their way in Orlando and desperate to keep a 22-year playoff streak alive. DeMar DeRozan is sparkling in the reboot, averaging 21.7 points per game in the restart and relishing the role as San Antonio\u2019s go-to guy. Yet the Spurs are also receiving solid results from his backcourt mate, Dejounte Murray, on both ends of the floor. The two guards are frisky, active and have the size and skill to make them tough to contain. Also, the Spurs come at you in droves. Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV are playing their finest ball of the season, and then there\u2019s Keldon Johnson, the rookie who spent much of the earlier season in the NBA G League. He\u2019s averaging 12.7 ppg while shooting 63% and 71.4% on 3-pointers. From a scrappy standpoint, the Lakers would have their hands full with San Antonio, a team playing stress-free and with nothing to lose. The Spurs might also be the biggest threat defensively against the Lakers because their roster is athletic and deep. Also, there\u2019s Popovich and The Streak. But the Lakers are leading the Spurs in the superstar department 2-0, and that\u2019s nearly impossible to overcome. Even the most biased of Suns observers would give Phoenix almost no chance of shocking the Lakers, and the Suns might need to confine their shock to the seeding games. Who knew they\u2019d win their first seven games and be positioned to run the table in the restart? This is beyond their wildest dreams and also their ceiling as a team. Obviously it all begins with Devin Booker, a leading contender for Kia NBA Player of the Seeding Games honors. His frustration over never making the playoffs so far career is clearly fueling him now. Booker is a feared scorer who\u2019s averaging over 31 ppg on 49.7% shooting in Orlando and would be a handful no matter who the Lakers threw at him. It\u2019s just that the rest of the Suns\u2019 talent is so unproven and untested in the postseason. Other than Ricky Rubio, who tasted the playoffs during his time in Utah, what other rotational player in Phoenix brings anything similar to the table? Deandre Ayton has had moments in Orlando, same for a handful of others, including Cameron Johnson, Mikal Bridges and Jevon Carter. Monty Williams has squeezed plenty from this crew here in his first year as coach, and with every win the Suns\u2019 confidence is expanding. Asking them to go undefeated in Orlando is one thing. Asking them to make the Lakers break a sweat is quite another. Woe and behold the Grizzlies, also known as the accidental Disney World tourists. Very little has gone right for Memphis since the former No. 8 seed landed in Orlando. The Grizzlies lost their very first game, to the Blazers no less, and that set the tone for much of their experience in the restart. When Jaren Jackson Jr. was lost for the duration with a knee injury, the ensuing slide was expected, and Memphis relinquished its hold on the final playoff spot without much of a fuss or fight. Because of this, the Lakers aren\u2019t dealing with sleepless nights while pondering a matchup with Memphis. No doubt, they\u2019d be troubled by the sight of slippery rookie Ja Morant, who badly wants a postseason berth, who\u2019d accept that challenge and demonstrate why he\u2019ll soon be named Kia Rookie of the Year. The Grizzlies offer other intriguing players but the majority are young and playoff untested. Even if Jackson was healthy, playing the Lakers would qualify as a learning experience and nothing more for Memphis. The Grizzlies are on pace to be special, yet are still a few years away from realizing their full potential. So that\u2019s what the Lakers are staring at \u2014 one potential threat and three potentially mild ones. The Suns, Blazers and Spurs are all ambitious \u2026 yet there\u2019s a reason why teams are ranked eighth. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.
