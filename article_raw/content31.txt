Only this time the handshake was obviously, and sentimentally, done by himself, with his best friend and former teammate DeRozan now in San Antonio. Warning: If you haven\u2019t seen the video below yet, hopefully you\u2019re using a waterproof device as tears may ensue. Lowry spoke on NBA TV about his pregame routine still including a moment that honors DeRozan. \u201cThat\u2019s just been working for me for a long time,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cHe\u2019s still my dog. He\u2019s my best friend in the world.\u201d The Raptors point guard said it\u2019s become such a tradition he doesn\u2019t want to stop it and risk throwing off his game. \u201cPeople saying, \u2018He\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s in Texas.\u2019 Hey listen, this is about me,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cThis is about me keeping up with my tradition. Yeah, that\u2019s my dog and he\u2019s always gonna be my best friend. But it\u2019s more about tradition.\u201d That tradition has continued to work well for Lowry so far this season. The four-time All-Star had a strong performance against the Wizards on Saturday, recording 28 points and 12 assists as Toronto moved to 3-0."},{"id":37988,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ben-simmons-exits-back-tightness","date":"2018-10-21","title":"Ben Simmons (back) exits game against Magic, won't return","content":" Philadelphia Sixers point forward Ben Simmons left Saturday\u2019s game against the Orlando Magic with back tightness.

Timberwolves fans continued to boo Butler every time he touched the ball in the first quarter, until he stole a pass and fed Taj Gibson for a dunk. The crowd immediately roared, as if the fans forgot who they were upset with because the play happened so fast. The four-time All-Star had plenty more highlight-reel dunks and steals from there. Soon enough, some \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d chants broke out as the Wolves went on a 52-23 run into the second quarter. Butler, who requested a trade from Minnesota exactly one month ago, finished with a team-high 33 points, seven rebounds and three assists in the Wolves\u2019 131-123 victory over the Cavaliers. Jerebko\u2019s shot at redemption  Less than three months after getting waived by the Jazz, Jonas Jerebko tipped in a shot against his former team with 0.3 seconds remaining to lift the Warriors to a 124-123 victory over the Jazz. Upon further review, it appears Rudy Gobert played a key role in the deciding bucket. Pelicans pushing the pace  Anthony Davis and Nikola Mirotic combined for 61 points as the Pelicans posted their highest single-game point total in franchise history in a 149-129 win over the Kings. New Orleans improved to 2-0 for the first time since the 2011-12 season and became the first team since Phoenix (3\/16\/10) to score 149 points in regulation. How high-scoring a night was it in the NBA? There were nine games, and 16 teams scored 100 points. Of those 16, 10 teams eclipsed 117. Raptors fans already chanting \u2018MVP\u2019 for Kawhi  Kawhi Leonard had 31 points and 10 rebounds, and the Raptors pulled away from the Celtics 113-101 in an early matchup between Eastern Conference contenders. Leonard played so well that he managed to get some very early MVP chants from the Raptors faithful while at the free-throw line. https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRenderNBA\/status\/1053461335378444289 Leonard said he appreciated the sentiment, if not the timing. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too early,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate the support. I know they\u2019re excited about us winning the game tonight.\u201d Who he play for?  Garrett Temple averaged 5.6 points during eight seasons with the Rockets, Kings, Spurs, Bucks, Hornets and Wizards. So perhaps we can forgive Charles Barkley for not knowing Temple\u2019s current team. One night after being featured on Inside The NBA\u2019s annual game show , Temple erupted for 30 points as Memphis rolled past Atlanta 131-117 . Temple, picked up in a July trade from the Sacramento Kings, missed only one of his 11 shots, making 5 of 6 from 3-point range. You can bet the Hawks know who Temple plays for. Breakout player alert  Caris LeVert\u2019s driving layup with a second left gave him a career-high 28 points as the Nets earned their first victory of the season, 107-105 over the Knicks. LeVert\u2019s previous best output was the 27 points he scored Wednesday night. Stat of the night  Giannis Antetokounmpo joins Kevin Garnett (2004-05) as the only players in NBA history to post at least 25 points, 15 rebounds and five assists in each of their team\u2019s first two games of the season. Gratuitous trampoline dunk of the night  The Bucks christened Fiserv Forum with a convincing 118-101 victory over the Pacers. Surprisingly, the dunk of the night was not this contested throwdown from Antetokounmpo. Give it up for the Rim Rockers . It\u2019s not every day you see a 360, double-clutch, between-the-legs windmill jam. Now that\u2019s entertainment!"},{"id":38012,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-open-new-arena-3-point-attack","date":"2018-10-20","title":"Bucks open new arena, unleash team record 46 3-point attempts","content":" MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night ripe for milestones \u2014 new arena, new coach, new beginning for the Bucks \u2014 no one would have guessed that Mike Budenholzer\u2019s first timeout would be called at Fiserv Forum before his team managed its first field goal. Yet there it was, at 9:42 of the first quarter, Milwaukee down 8-0 to the Indiana Pacers. \u201cThe first couple minutes, I don\u2019t know what it was. We were on another planet or something,\u201d Budenholzer said. Opening night jitters? Pressure to instantly establish a home-court advantage in their shiny new digs? Understandable, actually, on a big night for a franchise that isn\u2019t used to having such nice things, either around the court (the impressive building) or on it (Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s burgeoning stardom). The legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was in the house Friday, two arenas removed from where he led the Bucks to their greatest glories early in their history. What he and everybody else saw in Antetokounmpo was Milwaukee\u2019s best hope since those glory days to carry it to Finals appearances and someday even a second NBA title. That\u2019s a ways off, sure, but Antetokounmpo followed up his 25-point, 18-rebound performance against Charlotte on Wednesday by scoring 26 and grabbing 15 against the Pacers. The 33 rebounds through two games tied him for the most in Bucks history with, what d\u2019ya know, Abdul-Jabbar. Another bit of team history fell in their 118-101 victory : the Bucks launched 46 3-point shots, their most ever, and made 17. The Pacers were an old-millennium 6-of-18 by comparison, trading 2s for 3s as the gap on the scoreboard grew and grew. How distance-daffy were the Bucks? Antetokounmpo missed all six of his attempts and no one cared. Khris Middleton jacked up nine, center Brook Lopez shot eight. And there was 6-foot-11 John Henson launching and hitting two, one deep into the second quarter, the other to end the third, both from the left wing. He missed a \u201cheat check\u201d from the same area in the fourth to wind up 2-of-3 from the arc. Which was a little better than the 1-for-13 he\u2019d been through his first six NBA seasons, for five different Milwaukee coaches, through 392 career games. No wonder Antetokounmpo was teasing him from across the locker room afterward. \u201cJohn,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 spirited star called out, looking over a cluster of reporters, \u201cI\u2019m telling them about your 3-point shooting. You looked like KD out there.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cBud thing,\u201d as in Budenholzer, who has stretched his new team\u2019s attack to more effectively comply with the league\u2019s modern tenets and to open pathways into the paint for Antetokounmpo and guard Eric Bledsoe in particular. There\u2019s a truism in the NBA that offenses \u201ctake\u201d what the defenses \u201cgive\u201d them. But in this day and age, nobody is willingly giving an opponent 46 shots from 3-point range. Milwaukee is 31-of-80 (.388) after opening its season 14-of-34 against the Hornets. Last season, it averaged 8.8 makes on 24.7 attempts to rank 27th and 25th respectively. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the way the offense is, man,\u201d Henson said. \u201cOur motto is \u2018Let it fly.\u2019 We work on it every day \u2014 a lot. Shoot a lot of 3s. It\u2019s part of what we need to do to be successful. \u201cThis summer, Bud called me and told me, \u2018Shoot a lot of 3s.\u2019 That was the start of it. And that was kind of like, all summer. [The coaches] trust us, they give us confidence. But we work on it a lot. Every day we shoot 3s. Every day. Literally. That\u2019s new.\u201d That includes Antetokounmpo, whose 0-for-9 start to this season has him at 28 percent for his career from deep. \u201cIt\u2019s going up,\u201d he said late Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not stopping. I worked hard this summer.\u201d There\u2019s no sense doubting Antetokounmpo\u2019s ability to add that weapon to his arsenal in time. As Budenholzer said after the 23-year-old\u2019s dunk-filled display (with six turnovers for a total of 14 now), \u201cI\u2019m sure tonight he\u2019s going to go home and think of all the ways he can be better.\u201d In the meantime, though, just having deep threats around Antetokounmpo opens up more opportunities than ever for him and the Bucks to slice and dice. \u201cIt means more space for him,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cYou saw a lot tonight \u2014 attacking the gaps, guys hesitate a little to come over and load or come over and be the extra man at the rim. Because they know the big (Lopez or Henson) is out at the 3-point line or a guard is spotting up, waiting for him to pass it, and they know (Antetokounmpo) is a willing passer.\u201d With LeBron James having vacated the Eastern Conference, plenty of people see Antetokounmpo as next in line as the East\u2019s best player. Already, teams have to account for the Bucks\u2019 multi-dimensional marvel the way they did for Cleveland\u2019s former catalyst. \u201cHe\u2019s very capable of dominating the game with his ability to handle,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing him at the three and \u2026 a lot more at the four, a point forward. So he will be everywhere with the ball. He\u2019ll be leading their fast break. He\u2019ll be in the post, running the offense. Out front and out top, running pick-and-rolls with different combinations. So the versatility he has, you have to make sure you have the right matchup out there guarding.  \u201cSo it does pose a challenge similar to a LeBron because they\u2019re everywhere with the ball.\u201d With Antetokounmpo everywhere and his teammates way out there , the Bucks have a chance to stretch not just defenses but their opening night fun deep into 2018-19.

According to Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , Heat president Pat Riley has informed players that he has all but ended trade talks centered on acquiring Butler, a four-time All-Star. Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald reports that Riley spoke with the team last Sunday and, per a team spokesman, Riley apologized for players\u2019 names surfacing in the talks. He told the team \u201cI\u2019m pulling the plug,\u201d after talks went on for too long, but did not issue a guarantee that a trade won\u2019t happen down the road. \u201cIt calms you down, for sure, a little bit,\u201d point guard Goran Dragic told the Miami Herald . \u201cOf course, everybody is talking, including me. I just want to focus on my job. But deep down, it affects you a little bit. I want to stay here. I like it, really. So when Pat came after practice and sat us down and we had a small meeting, he told us that and you can feel a little bit of relief. But that doesn\u2019t mean, in the near future it can\u2019t happen. So we still need to do our job. We still need to be professionals.\u201d Miami has been the most frequently mentioned suitor for Butler, who made it clear to Timberwolves management that he preferred to be dealt before finishing out the final year of his contract. Minnesota, however, has held firm either in hopes that Butler will reconcile himself to the team or for an offer they can\u2019t refuse. In many of the Heat-Wolves trade scenarios bandied about, Miami guard Josh Richardson has seen his name come up several times. Richardson is trying his best to tune out the chatter, which has been on his mind when the rumors began circulating , writes Winderman. Butler had been absent for most of training camp and the preseason after he requested a trade from the team in September. He played and started in the Wolves\u2019 season-opener on Wednesday, scoring 23 points in 31 minutes as Minnesota lost to San Antonio . He returned to the team last week for a contentious practice where he reportedly called out his coaches, teammates and the front office. After the practice, Butler spoke with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols to explain his actions. The Timberwolves reportedly were close to trading Butler to the Miami Heat in early October, but the talks reportedly broke down at the last minute. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the trade negotiations between the Timberwolves and Heat \u201chave been dead\u201d. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and two steals per game for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round.

LeBron James stole the Trail Blazers\u2019 cross-court pass and before him was the open court \u2026 and thousands of open mouths, all bracing in anticipation of a moment. His fast-break dunk was just as you expected it would be, jammed through the basket with a cocked arm and followed by a brief pose at landing, for emphasis and style. The greatest player in the game was back in full soar Thursday but, as it were, his new team remained stuck to the floor. Overall, this process is gonna take some time, you think? Before the Los Angeles Lakers whip the basketball world into a frenzy, they must whip Portland. And also the Houston Rockets, who visit Staples Center on Saturday for the Lakers\u2019 home opener ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). And the Golden State Warriors. And Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans. And any team in the Western Conference that considers itself a contender. But you knew this, right? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go through some moments,\u201d LeBron said after the Lakers lost at Moda Center, 128-119 . \u201cWe\u2019ll have some adversity.\u201d True, this isn\u2019t an overnight sensation in the making. \u201cNot as fast as you (media) guys think it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d LeBron said. The Lakers will get more chances to make a first impression, and that\u2019s a good thing for them as they navigate through a potentially tricky transition period with their shiny new showpiece. There is only one thing that\u2019s a lock through this bumpy path: LeBron is still the force he was in Cleveland and Miami, his only other NBA stops. Months before turning 34, his flow and his basketball instincts remain steak-knife sharp and his pride is intact. He tipped off his season by playing 37 minutes \u2014 so much for reduced minutes here after 15 years of deep tread wear on his wheels \u2014 and delivered 26 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s crazy, a guy to be in his 16th year playing at that pace and above the rim the way he was,\u201d said Blazers guard Damian Lillard. \u201cHe looked like himself.\u201d That said, he and his teammates are still working on their wavelength. This was evident for much of the night, when connections were missed and confusion reigned at times. On Thursday, LeBron threw a behind-the-back pass that in Cleveland or Miami would usually hits its mark to teammates aware of his tendencies and timing. Last night, LeBron tried it and the ball dribbled out of bounds, all of which flummoxed LeBron and Kyle Kuzma (the nearest Laker). After the whistle blew and possession went to Portland, LeBron and Kuzma had a brief chat. \u201cI expected Kuz to pop,\u201d explained LeBron, \u201cand he rolled. Then another time (Rajon) Rondo went to the hole, JaVale (McGee) thought it was going to him and it was meant for me. We\u2019ll get better at that.\u201d These first few weeks, if the Lakers are fortunate, will be conducted in a vacuum and a laboratory. Transitions are usually like that. LeBron had a similar one in Miami eight years ago, when a 9-8 start playing alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh had folks thinking the sky was falling. With these Lakers, the reaction will \u2014 or should, anyway \u2014 be more muted if only because the expectations aren\u2019t through the ceiling this season. The Lakers are trying to nourish the limited basketball experience of Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram with LeBron (and Rajon Rondo) taking on more of a mentor role. That means class will be in session most, if not all, season. LeBron is preaching patience not only for those in and outside of the organization, but for himself as well. Sometimes, it\u2019s easier said than done. LeBron realizes that he\u2019s on the clock personally, even though his stamina and level of play remain high. \u201cA lot of these guys don\u2019t have as much experience, so I have to understand that,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd I do.\u201d LeBron seems cursed by celebrated season openers, falling to 0-4 all-time in his debut games . He scored 25 points in his rookie opener, but Cleveland lost to the Sacramento Kings. He had 31 in his Miami opener in a loss to the Boston Celtics. And he had 17 points in his Cleveland return in 2014, a home loss to the New York Knicks. The Lakers\u2019 crime Thursday was a failure to tighten up defensively and of course the mistakes that could be blamed on a getting-to-know-you game. And then there\u2019s another issue that LeBron will soon discover, if he hasn\u2019t already: He\u2019s not in the easy East anymore. \u201cThere\u2019s a tough game every night,\u201d Lillard said. The West had 10 teams with winning records last season fighting for eight playoff spots. Coaches and players in the West were fond of tweaking their neighbors across the Mississippi in 2017-18, saying the non-playoff teams in the West should take some East spots. Of last season\u2019s playoff teams, none return seriously weaker \u2014 unless you\u2019re ready to bury the San Antonio Spurs (who have a 21-year playoff streak going) or Minnesota Timberwolves (who are coping with the Jimmy Butler crisis). The Blazers were the No. 3 seed and were swept in the first round by the Pelicans, which puts the depth and overall strength of the West in perspective. Only three games separated the Blazers and the ninth-seeded Nuggets during the regular season. Meanwhile, the Rockets and Warriors were beyond the reach of mortals. LeBron chumped the East eight straight times to reach the NBA Finals. Yet by most indications, he\u2019s an A-list teammate away from spooking the Warriors \u2014 and that teammate isn\u2019t in a Lakers uniform this season. This journey through the West could either humble LeBron or, at the least, make him realize the work needed for the Lakers to regain contender status. Heck, the Lakers couldn\u2019t even prevent Nik Stauskas from having the biggest night of his NBA life. He scored 24 points and made more 3-pointers (five) than the Lakers\u2019 starting lineup (two) . It was telling that Lakers coach Luke Walton started Rondo over Ball at point guard \u2014 an understandable move after Ball missed several months recovering from knee issues . Rondo was mainly stellar (11 assists, three steals) while the Lakers\u2019 fourth-quarter lineups excluded Ball. Meanwhile, Hart (20 points off the bench) earned crunch time minutes. \u201cEveryone had different roles last year,\u201d Walton said, \u201cand some of those roles could change.\u201d Well, someone\u2019s role will remain the same. Regarding that guy, Walton said: \u201cGlad he\u2019s on our team.

The Bulls-Sixers game featured stellar performances from Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, the Heat-Wizards contest came down to a last-second game-winner from Kelly Olynyk and the Blazers beat the Lakers for the 16th consecutive time. But the biggest story of the night was LeBron James making his highly anticipated debut with Los Angeles, and a couple moments were captured in our new daily feature, About Last Night.  What better way to feed the massive enthusiasm going into LeBron James\u2019 Lakers debut than a first-quarter dunk contest? James\u2019 first official points in a Lakers uniform came on a classic breakaway, tomahawk jam. The play was immediately followed by a thunderous Damian Lillard dunk on the other end, which James answered by hammering home his second emphatic slam. After Kyle Kuzma hit the deck and got up on his own, LeBron gathered his teammates together for a message, one that preached brotherhood: \u201cAnytime y\u2019all fall, stay down. Your brother\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d Two minutes later, Josh Hart fell after a foul and waited patiently on his 6-foot-9 brother Brandon Ingram. Despite being the No. 1 Draft pick a year go, Markelle Fultz being in the starting lineup has left pundits scratching their heads throughout the Sixers\u2019 first two games. The 20-year-old still hasn\u2019t shot the ball well and often passed up open looks during Thursday\u2019s game against Chicago. None of that mattered when Fultz hit the first 3-pointer of his career in the fourth quarter, causing Philly fans to chant \u201cFultz\u201d the way they did \u201cFoles\u201d during the Eagles\u2019 championship run. Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg made the decision to start Bobby Portis over the newly acquired Jabari Parker. Portis dropped 13 points in the first quarter on a perfect 5-for-5 shooting, ending the night with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Parker scored 15. Despite the Bulls\u2019 loss, the fiery start by Portis left Hoiberg no reason to switch his lineup, which means we should see more of this at the scorers table\u2026 Remember those left-handed hammers John Wall would throw down after driving in from the wing? If not, here\u2019s a refresher. The patented move is back. The word to not jump is out.

After logging 1,054 consecutive starts in his NBA career, Anthony came off the bench for the Houston Rockets last night against the New Orleans Pelicans. He finished with with nine points on 3-of-10 shooting in 27 minutes in Houston\u2019s 131-112 defeat and, afterward, said he knows he has a long road ahead in adjusting to this new role. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging mentally more so than anything, having to prepare for the game differently,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cOther than that, it\u2019s a challenge all the way around. It\u2019s just a matter of how I\u2019m going to react to that challenge and accepting that challenge, which I am, which I will do. \u201cFor me, at this point, it\u2019s more about what I have to do for the sake of the team, instead of trying to just go out there and do whatever or trying to have a specific role. Every night will be different; but for the most part, it is a challenge, but it\u2019s something that I\u2019ll get used to quick.\u201d As a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder last season, Anthony balked at the notion of coming off the bench and stood by that stance in his exit interview . His thoughts on that role changed when he signed with the Rockets in free agency this summer, telling Houston\u2019s coaches he was open to whatever role would best suit the team. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said last night that he appreciates the sacrifice Anthony is making on behalf of the Rockets. Anthony\u2019s changing role reminded D\u2019Antoni of the Los Angeles Lakers teams of the early 1980s \u2014 and in particular, of Bob McAdoo. In 1981, the Lakers added the former MVP winner McAdoo via a trade. A future Hall of Famer, McAdoo willingly accepted a reserve role and was a key part in the Lakers\u2019 rotation during their \u201cShowtime\u201d Finals runs and on their NBA title teams in 1982 and \u201985. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the ideal situation for [Anthony], because he\u2019s a Hall of Famer and all that,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said before Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cI know it\u2019s a big adjustment, but you know what? He\u2019s true to his word. He said he\u2019d do anything for the team. We think that\u2019s best today. It might not be best later \u2014 we don\u2019t know \u2014 but having him is something that we didn\u2019t have last year. Obviously, it\u2019s really good. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough. We appreciate him doing it and trying to help us win a championship.\u201d All that said, it was a rough outing for Anthony as he was held to single-digit scoring in a season opener for the first time in his career. * * *"},{"id":38065,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-debut-games-career-lookback","date":"2018-10-18","title":"A look back at LeBron James' career debut games","content":" LeBron James is set to begin his 16th NBA season, having played in 1,143 games and logged 44,298 minutes in a career that includes four MVPs, three Finals MVPs, multiple All-NBA and All-Defensive awards and more. Yet only three times in his career has LeBron James had a debut game to look forward to. As he prepares for his new start with the Los Angeles Lakers tonight in Portland ( 10:30 ET, TNT ), let\u2019s take a quick look back at how \u201cThe King\u201d fared in his previous first games in his career. * * * The matchup:  Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Sacramento Kings LeBron\u2019s line:  25 points, six rebounds, nine assists, four steals, two turnovers in 42 minutes Result:  Kings 106, Cavs 92 The game:  On Oct. 29, 2003, high school phenom LeBron James officially went from No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 Draft to NBA player. It was one of the most hyped and awaited moments in not just the NBA, but sports at large. For his part individually, James showed why he was so highly billed, even though his Cavaliers would ultimately lose their opener against the Kings. The aftermath:  James eventually ran away with Rookie of the Year honors and was named All-Rookie first team in 2003-04 as well. A season later, he was an All-Star and an All-NBA player for the first time in his career, starting a string of 14 seasons (and counting) of him collecting those honors. Then came All-Star Game MVP honors (in 2006 and \u201908), back-to-back NBA MVP honors (in \u201909 and \u201910) and Cleveland\u2019s first trip to The Finals (\u201908). But after seven seasons with the Cavs, James opted for a scenery change in the summer of 2010 and signed with the Miami Heat, setting up another debut \u2026 * * * The matchup:  Miami Heat vs. Boston Celtics LeBron\u2019s line:  31 points, four rebounds, three assists, one steal, two blocks, eight turnovers in 42 minutes, 39 seconds Result:  Celtics 88, Heat 80 The game:  The Heat waited all summer to see what James \u2014 and fellow free-agent addition Chris Bosh \u2014 could do playing alongside resident Miami stud Dwyane Wade. While James played up to his usual standards (save for the turnovers), rough outings from Bosh (eight points on 3-for-11 shooting) and Wade (13 points, 3-16 FG) were key in Miami losing its season-opener. The aftermath:  The Heat\u2019s ho-hum start to 2010-11 (they were 9-8 at one point) didn\u2019t last long. Behind James, they rolled up the East\u2019s second-best record and rampaged through the 2011 playoffs en route to The Finals. Although they ultimately lost that series , James and Co. scorched opponents in the next two seasons. As LeBron racked up two more MVPs in \u201911-12 and \u201912-13, the Heat also won the NBA title in those seasons, too . The Heat never lost more than six playoff games in the East playoffs in any given LeBron-led season, but by 2014, James was ready to enter free agency again \u2026 * * * The matchup:  New York Knicks vs. Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron\u2019s line:  17 points, five rebounds, four assists, eight turnovers in 43 minutes, 14 seconds Result:  Knicks 95, Cavs 90 The game: Signing James in free agency was just part of the Cavs\u2019 offseason makeover, which included adding All-Star big man Kevin Love, too. He joined James and star guard Kyrie Irving to comprise a new Cleveland \u201cBig Three\u201d who performed about as expected in their first game together. Irving got his first taste of playing the point alongside LeBron (22 points, seven assists, five rebounds) while Love (19 points, 14 rebounds, four assists) fared decent, too. The aftermath:  More reunion than pure \u201cdebut\u201d, this showdown with the Knicks marked LeBron\u2019s official return to his first NBA team and the start of his quest to bring the Cavs a title. Although turmoil and roster changes marked the LeBron reunion tour at times, so, too, did success. The Cavs made four straight Finals from 2014-18 and, although they were 7-15 overall on that stage in that stretch, they also did get their first NBA title in historic fashion in 2016 . That run ended last summer and James opted for the bright lights of Hollywood, leading to his latest debut. * * *"},{"id":38068,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/18-5","date":"2018-10-18","title":"About Last Night: Full slate of firsts","content":"After Tuesday\u2019s contender-filled appetizer , Wednesday offered the first main course of the 2018-19 season. Picking out entrees from an 11-game menu wasn\u2019t easy, but it was a whole lot of fun. Take a seat, grab a wad of napkins and dig in with our new daily feature, About Last Night. Toronto\u2019s excited about Kawhi. Like, really, really excited. And why shouldn\u2019t they be? This is a franchise that has never boasted an All-NBA First Teamer. Live it up! Leonard lived up to the hype, finishing with 24 points and 12 rebounds in Toronto\u2019s 116-104 win over Cleveland. The debate preceded the Draft and continues into the regular season. Dominant college big man or European passing sensation? One game hardly provides an answer, but Ayton made an overwhelmingly positive first impression. The No. 1 overall pick finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in Phoenix\u2019s 121-100 victory . Doncic, meanwhile, struggled from the field (5-for-16 FG) but still amassed 10 points, eight rebounds and four assists. The highlights of their first NBA clash were fast and furious in the opening minutes. Boban Marjanovic is a very skilled and very large human being. That is why the 7-foot-3 Serbian finished with 18 points and eight rebounds in just 18 minutes on Wednesday night . No visual lasted longer than the image of Marjanovic dunking the ball and hanging from the rim \u2014 while touching the floor at the same time. He did this twice in the fourth quarter alone. The show of sheer size and strength was awesome. It was also very nearly damaging to the poor rim, which needed to be checked after the second dunk before play could continue. Sidenote: Would it have been easier to have Boban fix it than have two guys dragging out the ladder? Jimmy Butler wanted (and, to the best of our knowledge, still wants) out of Minnesota . He hasn\u2019t gotten his wish yet, but he showed up for Game One to put up 23 points in Minnesota\u2019s loss to the Spurs . After not practicing with the team very much during the offseason, it was only natural for guys like Andrew Wiggins to feel a little off taking passes from the discontented veteran. It was too much of a coincidence. The Knicks\u2019 offense was dead, an 0-for-9 eyesore against the rebuilding Atlanta Hawks. Hardly the kind of opening statement a team wants to make at home. Then he came. The fan. The flame that ignited New York\u2019s offense to blistering levels. That gentleman\u2019s excitement must have been contagious. How else do you explain the Knicks shooting 26-for-42 (61.9 percent) for the rest of the half immediately after this epic half-court banker? Would a new coach mean new results for Milwaukee? The Bucks haven\u2019t advanced to the second round of the playoffs since 2001. They have the star power (Giannis Antetokounmpo) to break that streak. They brought in former Coach of the Year Mike Budenholzer to make all the pieces fit around him. One quarter into the season, the hire already looked genius. The Bucks shot 13-for-22, including 7-for-11 from 3-point range. By the time their 113-112 win was sewn up, Milwaukee finished with 49.4-percent shooting overall and 41.2 from downtown. The number of times Milwaukee surpassed that elite 50-40 mark last season: Just 11. Remember when Blake Griffin was best known for leaping so high over people he would literally throw the ball through the basket? Knicks and Thunder fans surely do. The former NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion appeared on the verge of creating another poster in Detroit. Everything was there. Losing the initial defender. The leap. The cocking back of the basketball. But then something happened: Jarrett Allen. With Rajon Rondo off to Laker Land, the Pelicans were in need of another point guard. They got one in Louisiana native Elfrid Payton, who was drafted 10th overall in 2014 after a standout career at Louisiana at Lafayette. Payton\u2019s homecoming was a sweet, stat-stuffing affair. The Pelicans\u2019 new playmaker finished with an absurdly symmetrical triple-double of 10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds in New Orleans\u2019 131-112 romp over the Rockets. The triple-double was just the fifth posted by a player in his team debut, and the first since Lewis Lloyd with the Rockets in 1983. * * *"},{"id":38043,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-frontcourt-dominates-rockets","date":"2018-10-18","title":"Led by Anthony Davis, Nikola Mirotic, Pelicans' frontcourt dominates in win over Rockets","content":" Can the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 frontcourt keep up this torrid pace?

The Suns have also waived guard Davon Reed. One of the most explosive scorers in NBA history, and one of the most respected players among his peers in the league today, he is the only three-time winner of the Sixth Man of the Year Award (2009-10, 2013-14, 2015-16) and also won the NBA\u2019s Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award in 2017-18. Crawford ranks fifth in NBA history with 2,153 career three-pointers, 30th with 1,262 games played and 57th with 18,906 career points; his 10,766 career points in a reserve role are second-most in the NBA over the past 35 years behind only Dell Curry. Crawford is the NBA\u2019s all-time leader with 53 career four-point plays. For his career, the 38-year-old has averaged 15.0 points, 3.4 assists and 2.3 rebounds while shooting 34.9 percent from three-point range in 18 seasons with seven teams: Chicago (2000-2004), New York (2004-2008), Golden State (2008-09), Atlanta (2009-2011), Portland (2011-12), the LA Clippers (2012-2017) and Minnesota (2017-18). A career 86.2 percent shooter from the free throw line (37th-best in NBA history), Crawford led the league by shooting 92.7 percent from the stripe with the Trail Blazers in 2011-12. He owns three career games scoring 50-plus points, including a career-high 52 points with the Knicks against Miami on Jan. 26, 2007, and is one of four players in NBA history to score at least 50 points with three different teams along with Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Bernard King and Moses Malone.

The Nuggets announced today that they have agreed to a contract extension with coach Michael Malone. In his time with the Nuggets, Malone has amassed a 119-127 record, but has increased Denver\u2019s win total each season (from 33 wins in 2015-16 to 46 wins last season). ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Malone\u2019s extension adds two years to his current deal, which was entering its final season. Denver\u2019s 46 wins last season were its most since 2012-13, when the Nuggets won 57 games. Before being hired by Denver , Malone was coach of the Sacramento Kings from 2013-14 to December of 2014. He was let go by the Kings after an 11-13 start to the 2014-15 season and, overall, was 39-67 in his time with the Kings. In Denver, Malone has played a key role in the rise of center Nikola Jokic, who has become a borderline All-Star. Jokic set career-highs in scoring (18.5 points per game), rebounding (10.7 rebounds per game) and assists (6.1 assists per game) last season. He finished with 10 triple-doubles last season , the fourth-most in the NBA and the most among centers . The Nuggets went 8-3 in their last 11 games of 2017-18 and 6-1 in their final seven games. However, Denver missed out on the playoffs in 2018 after falling in a win-or-go-home game to the Minnesota Timberwolves on the season\u2019s final night.

For Jordan, Stockton and Barkley in particular, their debut on the NBA stage all happened on the same day: Oct. 26, 1984. Flashes of their future careers \u2014 which would include NBA MVPs, all-time records and other accolades \u2014 were seen in the first game for each player. Here\u2019s a quick look back at how each player fared in their NBA debut \u2026 The No. 3 overall pick of the 1984 draft by the Chicago Bulls, Jordan got his first taste of NBA game play against the Washington Bullets. Chicago defeated Washington, 109-93, with Jordan scoring 16 points (on 5-for-16 shooting). He also added six rebounds, seven assists, two steals and four blocks in 40 minutes as a starter. Jordan\u2019s best game as a rookie came on Feb. 2, 1985, when he went for 49 points, 15 rebounds, five assists and four steals in a win against the Detroit Pistons. Overall, Jordan scored 17 or more points in 76 of 82 games that season and started every game. He won Rookie of the Year, finished 3rd in scoring (28.2 ppg) and was All-NBA Second Team. The Philadelphia 76ers took Charles Barkley with the No. 5 pick in the 1984 draft and were not disappointed with the results. In his NBA debut \u2014 a 111-101 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 Barkley was plenty solid. He had 11 points, six rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block in 27 minutes off the bench. Barkley\u2019s best game as rookie came on Feb. 22, 1985 against the Detroit Pistons. That night, he logged 29 points, 18 rebounds and three steals in a Sixers win. As a rookie, Barkley grabbed 10 or more rebounds in 33 games, started 60 games overall and was named to the All-Rookie Team. A diminutive point guard from Gonzaga University, Stockton had to wait a while for his starting bid in Utah. However, the No. 16 pick in the 1984 Draft showed a brief taste of what would make him a future NBA standout in his debut game.  As a backup on the Jazz, Stockton played 17 minutes in a 102-94 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics. He finished with four points, two rebounds and five assists in that game. Overall, S tockton\u2019s best game as rookie came on Dec. 1, when he logged 13 points, 12 assists and three steals in a loss to the Denver Nuggets. Stockton played 17 minutes or less in 45 of his 82 games as a rookie and started five games. But, by the 1987-88 season, Stockton became the Jazz\u2019s full-time starter and started his run of All-Star-level play. * * * More Legendary Moments"},{"id":38061,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-still-timberwolves-opener","date":"2018-10-17","title":"Jimmy Butler to join Wolves in opener at Spurs","content":" Just like last season, Jimmy Butler and the Minnesota Timberwolves traveled to San Antonio for their opener ( 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass ). After all the disruption caused by Butler\u2019s trade request that became public a week before training camp began, no deal has been made. So the four-time All-Star, who took part in today\u2019s morning shootaround, will be on the court facing off against the Spurs with his Timberwolves teammates tonight, no matter the awkwardness that might be lingering. \u201cI\u2019m planning on playing him, and if he feels good he\u2019ll be ready to go,\u201d Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said after an abbreviated practice on Tuesday, before the team departed for the airport for the trip. Butler has only participated in four days of on-court workouts with the team, starting with his raucous appearance a week ago. Thibodeau canceled practice the following day, and Butler did not accompany the team to the preseason game on Friday because of what was officially announced as rehabilitation for his right hand that was surgically repaired in July. According to multiple reports, Butler and Wolves owner Glen Taylor reached an an agreement that boils down to the Wolves continuing to seek a trade for Butler and Butler agreeing to play up to par. Taylor confirmed as much in an interview with the Star Tribune\u2019s Sid Hartman on Tuesday . As for the future of Thibodeau, Taylor told the newspaper that the coach\u2019s job is safe. Taylor credited Thibodeau for trying to help mend the rift between Butler and the Wolves and says he still has \u201cfaith\u201d in Thibodeau\u2019s ability to do the job. After another day off for the team, Butler was back at it with the rest of the Wolves on Sunday and made available for questions afterward to local reporters for the first time. His first public comments on his status came in an  ESPN interview a few hours after his demonstrative arrival last week. \u201cThey want me to go out here and hoop to the best of my abilities,\u201d Butler said. \u201cMake sure I\u2019m healthy, compete, because that\u2019s what I love to do, and do it for the guys in the same jerseys as me.\u201d Whether Butler\u2019s teammates are happy to have him around while he\u2019s simultaneously wanting out, well, that depends on the guy. Fellow All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns was clipped in his replies to questions about Butler\u2019s presence. \u201cHaving his talent on the court is going to give us a lot to work with,\u201d Towns said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the best we can to make that adjustment and make sure that everyone\u2019s comfortable.\u201d Newcomer Anthony Tolliver delved a little deeper into the topic of Butler on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to say some words, but even if he doesn\u2019t say a word, he\u2019s a leader. He\u2019s someone you can look at and say, `All right, I can rock with you,\u2019 because I know what your intentions are,\u201d Tolliver said. \u201cJust being around him the last 10 days or whatever it\u2019s been, I can tell instantly what type of impact he has on this team.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt about getting Butler\u2019s best on the court, at least, for as long as he\u2019s still with the Wolves. \u201cIt\u2019s not in his DNA to slack,\u201d Tolliver said. The Wolves lost four of their five preseason games, allowing an average of 123.8 points per game. Meaningless exhibition or not, their performance left much to be desired while the Butler saga swirled around the team. \u201cWe did not take preseason as seriously as we should have. That\u2019s all of our faults. I\u2019m not going to blame it on one or two people or three or four,\u201d Tolliver said. \u201cWe should have just approached it a lot better. We didn\u2019t, but we can\u2019t control that now. All we can control is today, tomorrow and the future.\u201d Who knows whether Butler, who can become a free agent next summer, will continue to be a part of that? \u201cEverything\u2019s fluid,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to improve the club any way we can.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":38063,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-early-assessment-warriors-opener","date":"2018-10-17","title":"Blogtable: Your extremely early assessment of Warriors after one game?","content":"* * * Your extremely early assessment of the Warriors after just one game? * * * Steve Aschburner :  Next year, it\u2019s going to be secret decoder rings, right? And the secret code is going to read: \u201cOakland, we miss you.\u201d Or something like that. This presumes another Warriors championship, which is one of my takeaways from Golden State\u2019s opener Tuesday. That team\u2019s sense of purpose in its final season at Oracle Arena will be profound, because the NBA\u2019s most savvy crowd even in lean times is going to change, somehow, some way, in the shiny new digs across the bay. My other takeaway from Game 1: the training staff could wind up as collective MVP of this squad. From Andre Iguodala\u2019s and Shaun Livingston\u2019s inevitable high-mileage issues and Draymond Green\u2019s preseason knee soreness to unexpected hiccups that could slow Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson or others, the Warriors\u2019 remarkable run of relatively good health is due for some regression to the NBA mean. Tas Melas :  They\u2019re rejuvenated because some young players have replaced vets in the rotation (Damian Jones for Zaza Pachulia, Quinn Cook for Nick Young). The Warriors only have five players born in the 1980s after having nine to start last season. They\u2019re trying to keep that dynasty alive and are also a little fresher than last season (because they didn\u2019t have to make a preseason trip to China). Shaun Powell :  Early assessment? That the Warriors would be wise to keep their lapses to a minimum. Barely getting by an OKC team without Russell Westbrook was a reflection of last season when the Warriors lost seven of their last 10 and didn\u2019t grab home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. But pretty soon, DeMarcus Cousins is coming, so what does it matter for the regular season? John Schuhmann :  There was certainly more to learn about the other three teams that played on Tuesday , and one game isn\u2019t going to tell us if the Warriors\u2019 (collective) foot will be on the gas more than it was last season, when fatigue and disinterest had them taking a step backward defensively. Ring night comes with an unusual vibe and the Thunder were without Russell Westbrook, taking some of the juice out of the matchup. Turnovers continue to be an issue, but the champs should feel pretty good about the ability of their young bigs to step into larger roles.  Sekou Smith :  Nothing has changed. The Warriors are still the class of the league and don\u2019t look any worse for wear after piling up the best four-year win total in NBA history. Anyone picking against the reigning and two-time defending champs better be willing to explain their thinking in detail, because a healthy Warriors team looks as formidable on opening night as they did the last time we saw them (in The Finals). The most remarkable part about what the Warriors have done during this run is their continued shuffling of their big man rotation. The player-development component with the franchise is at another level. And the scariest thing is we haven\u2019t even seen what DeMarcus Cousins will look like on this team."},{"id":38051,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-all-star-first-mitchell-or-simmons","date":"2018-10-17","title":"Blogtable: Will Mitchell or Simmons become a first-time All-Star this season?","content":" * * * More likely to become a first-time All-Star this season: Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Ben Simmons. Look, Donovan Mitchell is a young guy I want on my team. But this is a numbers thing and, after that, a \u201cspecialness\u201d thing. The West has more All-Star candidates \u2014 take a look at the East-West breakdown of All-NBA selections from this spring \u2014 so playing in the East favors Simmons. So does his mix of size and skills, on top of how much the basketball will be in his hands. If he\u2019s averaging a near-triple double through January, whether his jump shot has markedly improved or not, the Sixers supersized point guard will force the fans\u2019 or coaches\u2019 hands when they vote. Tas Melas :  Ben Simmons. The Eastern Conference is the best-ern conference if you wanna be an All-Star. This is really more about \u2018right place, right time\u2019 than it is about ability. I have no doubt in my mind that Donovan Mitchell has improved this offseason \u2014 I can\u2019t wait to see how that floater\/mid-range game has developed. But for the standard five All-Star guard spots in the West, he\u2019s dealing with Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, DeMar DeRozan, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, et al, for a spot. Then again, if the Jazz are a top-three seed when the ballots hit the hands of coaches \u2014 and those Jazz players seem to be very much in-sync \u2014 Mitchell could most definitely be chosen. Just easier in the East. Shaun Powell :  Donovan Mitchell will likely be leading his team in scoring and have the Jazz pushing for second place in the West when the votes are being collected. Therefore, he gets a slight edge here, though it will be a mild surprise if both players aren\u2019t in the game. John Schuhmann :  Ben Simmons has to have the edge just because he\u2019s in the Eastern Conference, which lost two 2018 All-Stars (DeMar DeRozan and LeBron James) in the offseason and another (Kristaps Porzingis) to injury. Kawhi Leonard will take one of those spots and Mitchell could be the leading scorer on the third best team in the West, but he\u2019s in a crowded West backcourt field with Stephen Curry, DeRozan, James Harden, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson and Russell Westbrook.  Sekou Smith :  Simmons gets the slight edge here , due in large part to a clearing of the All-Star ranks in the Eastern Conference. The logjam for All-Star spots in the Western Conference will be much thicker, preventing Mitchell from ascending without a monster individual season and a banner year from the Jazz as a team. Mitchell\u2019s going to be the unquestioned No. 1 option for the Jazz and won\u2019t have another All-Star to share the spotlight with the way Simmons does with Joel Embiid. But there is a preposterous amount of star talent crowding the All-Star picture out west. There will be some difficult choices to be made for those reserve spots. Simmons won\u2019t have quite as much competition to make his first All-Star team."},{"id":38067,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-breakout-sophomore-season-fultz-ball","date":"2018-10-17","title":"Blogtable: Fultz or Ball more likely to have breakout second season?","content":" * * * More likely to have a breakout sophomore season: Markelle Fultz or Lonzo Ball? * * * Steve Aschburner :  Lonzo Ball. My hunch is based on the tutelage of LeBron James, who has plenty of incentive to invest time and energy into the Lakers\u2019 top pick from a year ago \u2013 and who has gotten plenty of other unproven teammates to blossom (Matthew Dellavedova, Tristan Thompson). Fultz has as much or more pressure on him, to justify his No. 1 status from 2017 (and the trade with Boston), but on a team built around other young stars who won\u2019t be mentoring him. I\u2019m not saying Fultz can\u2019t get back to even, but Ball has a better environment in which to thrive. Tas Melas :  Fultz, because there\u2019s a lot more room for improvement. Outside of scoring, Ball had a productive year across the board last season. He fulfilled his promise as a passer, rebounder, and defender \u2014 Fultz has yet to meet expectations in any one aspect of his game. What Ball provides as a player was sort of an after-thought when he was scrutinized last season \u2014 \u201cIs he hitting shots?\u201d was really the only question people cared about. If you only listened to the narrative and didn\u2019t watch him play, you wouldn\u2019t think Ball averaged roughly seven assists, seven rebounds, two steals and a block per game. Those are gonna be hard to exceed. Any regular success from Fultz is a breakthrough. Shaun Powell :  Or you could ask: Whose jumper will be better? Because that\u2019s what it might come down to. In this case, I\u2019ll go with Markelle Fultz, whose team will ask a bit more from him mainly because, unlike Ball, he won\u2019t have LeBron James around to steal some of his role. John Schuhmann :  Lonzo Ball. Fultz has the higher ceiling and could be a better scorer than Ball, but Ball is starting from a better place and will probably contribute more to his team\u2019s success. He\u2019s already a strong rebounder and defender, and even if he\u2019s not a good shooter, he\u2019s not hesitant to shoot (which matters). Playing alongside LeBron James is another point for Ball, and we haven\u2019t seen enough from Fultz in the preseason and in Game 1 on Tuesday to be very confident in a breakthrough from the former No. 1 pick.  Sekou Smith :  Lonzo Ball. He\u2019ll have the benefit of playing off of LeBron James and won\u2019t have the pressure Markelle Fultz has on him. As much as Ball has to prove on a completely revamped Lakers team, Fultz has even more to prove after his washout rookie season. There are still question marks about his game, both internally and beyond the walls of the Sixers\u2019 fortress. Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons need Fultz to break out now, meanwhile Ball has a buffer now in the form of LeBron, Rajon Rondo and some of the other veterans that have been added to the roster. He\u2019ll have the freedom to carve out a very specific role on a Lakers team that will not be desperate for him to take his game to the next level right away."},{"id":38045,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-spurs-or-pelicans-more-likely-miss-playoffs","date":"2018-10-17","title":"Blogtable: Are Spurs or Pelicans more likely to miss playoffs?","content":" * * * More likely to miss the playoffs this season: Spurs or Pelicans?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  The Pelicans. Both these flawed teams should be propped up a bit by intangibles \u2014 the Spurs\u2019 habit of reaching the postseason, the Pelicans\u2019 urgency to do so to keep big man Anthony Davis happy. Both these teams suffered personnel losses \u2014 Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili gone from San Antonio ( and Dejounte Murray sidelined ), DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo out of New Orleans. To me, the Pelicans will need something Herculean from Davis, Jrue Holiday and newcomer Julius Randle to avoid backsliding out of the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Spurs at least added All-Star DeMar DeRozan and still have coach Gregg Popovich and defensive principles to trust. Tas Melas :  Ugh \u2026 these are two outcomes I definitely don\u2019t want to pick from. It feels extremely wrong\/stupid\/ignorant to doubt Gregg Popovich with two All-Stars. Amazingly, the Spurs had a top-three defense last season without Kawhi Leonard\u2019s claws for most of it and they\u2019ve been a top-three defense for the last six seasons! But I think this is finally the year that mark is snapped considering the aging starting lineup and no Dejounte Murray. The Pelicans have a formula that got them to the Western Conference semifinals last season while the Spurs are gonna have to reinvent theirs. I\u2019m not doubting Anthony Davis as he heads in to his prime or Jrue Holiday after he re-found his groove. Gimme the Spurs (this still feels dumb). Shaun Powell :  Being without Dejounte Murray for the season could cost the Spurs a handful of games in a conference where only three games separated the No. 3 seed from the No. 9 last season. So let\u2019s go with the Spurs as the odd team out for the first time in 21 years, despite what will surely be a strong coaching effort from Gregg Popovich. John Schuhmann :  It\u2019s hard to predict the end of the Spurs\u2019 21-year playoff streak, but it\u2019s harder to imagine this team being good enough on both ends of the floor to finish higher than Golden State, Houston, Utah, Denver, Oklahoma City or the Lakers. Both of these teams are probably in a fight for the final two spots with Minnesota and Portland. The Spurs have had a top-five defense for six straight years, but lost a lot of that end of the floor with the departures of Danny Green and Kyle Anderson, along with the injury to Dejounte Murray. And on offense, LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan, in addition to being mid-range heavy, aren\u2019t the type of pairing where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The Pelicans have questions in regard to their depth, their size on the wings, and point guards not named Jrue Holiday. But Holiday + Anthony Davis + shooting is a pretty good formula for success. Davis took things to a new level after DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 injury last season and is by far the best player on either of these teams. Sekou Smith :  The Spurs have playoff DNA embedded in every crack and crevice of their organization. So it\u2019s hard to see them falling all the way out of the playoff mix, which almost happened last season. It\u2019s still extremely difficult to think of them missing out this season, especially with DeMar DeRozan sporting a huge chip on his shoulder these days. But if it\u2019s a choice between the Spurs and Pelicans this season, I can\u2019t pick against Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. Not after what I saw from them in that first-round playoff series wipeout of Portland. So I\u2019d say the Spurs are more likely to miss the playoffs of the two. But I\u2019ve got both the Pelicans and Spurs in my top eight in the Western Conference (Minnesota is the odd team out this time around)."},{"id":38060,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/suns-devin-booker-ready-go-opener","date":"2018-10-17","title":"Suns' Booker ready to go for season-opener","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Mavericks vs. Suns, 10:30 ET The Phoenix Suns will have their best player in uniform when their 2018-19 season tips off tonight.

He had been expected to miss six weeks, but has been working feverishly to get into position to play against Dallas. Originally, he was slated to return on Oct. 22 for a game against the Golden State Warriors. After yesterday\u2019s practice, Booker told reporters he is happy to be suiting up for the Suns\u2019 first game of the season, writes Duane Rankin of the Arizona Republic . Booker said he plans to tape his two outside fingers together as a precaution. He had some reservations last week about the hand, but said his injury \u201ccan\u2019t get worse,\u201d especially with tape on it. Booker averaged 24.9 points per game last season, his third in the NBA, and signed a five-year maximum extension with Phoenix in the offseason.

It\u2019s their tug-of-war with change, which was evident Tuesday on Opening Night , their last in this city before moving to a new home in San Francisco. And eight months from now, who knows, maybe change is tapping them on their shoulder once more. Or more specifically, it\u2019s Kevin Durant, a free agent next summer, rapping the franchise with his two-week notice. Until another team steps forward and issues a challenge that the Warriors can\u2019t beat, this will be their reality, for better or possibly for worse. That\u2019s why the vibe in Oracle Arena ran high on sentiment as the Warriors, one by one, collected their championship rings before tipoff against Oklahoma City. Crafted by Jason of Beverley Hills, the rings showcase a unique and unprecedented reversible crown. How nice, although that feature runs counter philosophically to a team trying to keep a good thing going in the same direction. It\u2019s two straight titles and three in four seasons for the Warriors, and they know the drill by now. They must navigate through an 82-game obstacle course and try to stay interested until the postseason, when the real fun begins. \u201cWe know we have something special standing right before us, and these kind of opportunities don\u2019t come along very often,\u201d said Stephen Curry. \u201cBut it\u2019s one thing to talk about it. We have to do the things necessary to get it. We feel confident that we can.\u201d There were stretches during their 108-100 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder that didn\u2019t appear championship-like. Sloppy play and 5-for-20 shooting from Klay Thompson made for a more suspenseful game than necessary against a Thunder team without Russell Westbrook, still mending from an offseason knee procedure. But Curry was good for 32 points and nine assists, with Durant chipping in 27 points. Coach Steve Kerr offered that his Warriors are not fine-tuned yet, adding: \u201cWe didn\u2019t look much like ourselves, but that isn\u2019t surprising. We need another couple of weeks.\u201d As a bonus, the Warriors got a combined 22 points and 13 rebounds worth of raw energy from Damian Jones \u2014 who\u2019s keeping the starting center spot warm for DeMarcus Cousins \u2014 and Kevon Looney (who also split time at center). \u201cIt\u2019s going to come after a while,\u201d said Durant. \u201cI love where we are.\u201d This is their 47th and final year in Oakland, a sister city that, win or more often lose, has always embraced the Warriors. In many ways, Oakland reflects the team \u2014 majority African-American, resilient and, yes, dealing with change itself. You can see it in the cranes that pierce the sky over downtown construction sites. With Silicon Valley churning out well-paying high-tech jobs to the south, gentrification is creeping to the East Bay, pushing up real estate prices and pushing out some long-time residents. The transition is perhaps inevitable and maybe necessary to some degree, but it\u2019s also awkward and runs the risk of causing Oakland to lose a portion of its identity, of what made it unique and set it apart. \u201cWe love Oakland,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe feel very close to the people here whether that\u2019s walking into Oracle or going out to lunch. We know the new arena is going to be amazing and we are looking forward to it, but we\u2019re going to miss Oracle and we\u2019re going to miss Oakland. There\u2019s no easy way to slice it. It\u2019s a great move for this organization but this place is special and we want to make it a special season.\u201d Money talks, and the clamoring for a wildly successful franchise is getting louder from across the Bay. The privately-financed Chase Center will bring all the amenities you\u2019d expect inside a splashy arena that will instantly become a destination spot. The Warriors should make lots of money there, an entertainment playpen for the dot-commers (and not celebrities) who populate the front rows at Warriors games. Even better, the timing is impeccable. Chances are very good that the Warriors will open their new place next fall by raising another banner \u2014 one they won in the old place. They\u2019re still a three-time champion in their prime, with only Durant, Curry and Andre Iguodala having reached 30 among the core. Despite a potential beast in the making in L.A. with LeBron James joining the Lakers, and the Boston Celtics anxious to see the damage a healthy team can do, this remains a Warriors world. That\u2019s because, should Cousins effectively heal from his Achilles injury and returns to the level of a four-time All-Star \u2014 admittedly, nothing is certain \u2014 then the Warriors will boast stars at every position on the floor. In their prime. \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d said Durant. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unusual to see Durant so uncommitted about his future plans. Surely it\u2019s not financial; he\u2019ll get paid by the Warriors. Something else? A chance to put his own stamp on a team, the way Kyrie Irving did when he bolted Cleveland? Who knows. Maybe Durant isn\u2019t sure himself and clarity is several months away. Thompson says he wants to stay, but can the Warriors pay everyone, especially with Draymond Green up for renewal in 2020? And so it begins. In a classy and neat touch, Curry invited Eric Housen to join the players on the floor for the banner ceremony. Housen began as a ball boy with the Warriors in the late 1980s and stayed with the club, eventually working his way up to equipment manager and valued jack-of-all-trades. What a scene: A 30-year club employee, laughing and smiling at his unexpected good fortune, getting playful shoves from the players, helping to put the final touch on the Warriors\u2019 recent past.

Most of that fun and excitement takes place on the hardwood. But as followers of social media know, off the court can be just as entertaining. We\u2019ll attempt to chronicle it all here at NBA.com with a new daily feature, About Last Night. So without further ado, let\u2019s NBA! This will either make you laugh or haunt your dreams, but here\u2019s Kawhi Leonard\u2019s laughter synthesized with the old \u201cNBA on NBC\u201d theme to ring in another NBA season. Enjoy! https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v If you\u2019re going to sneak some TV in before tipoff, it might as well be \u201cRick and Morty.\u201d Veteran forward Gordon Hayward wasn\u2019t great against the 76ers, missing 8 of 12 shots en route to 10 points \u2014 less than half what he averaged in his All-Star season with the Utah Jazz in 2016-17. That, of course, completely ignores any context, with Hayward playing his first regular-season game in exactly a year since suffering a gruesome, season-ending leg injury in the 2017 opener. From that standpoint it was a wild success. Hayward suffered no setbacks as the Celtics, flaunting the type of depth most NBA teams can only dream of, crushed the Sixers by 18. Hayward doesn\u2019t expect to be full strength any time soon as the Celtics will limit his minutes closely. But for now, simply contributing and staying healthy is good enough for him. \u201cThat was a big step for me mentally,\u201d Hayward told Celtics.com . \u201cIt was a big confidence booster just to finish that first game. Being back out on the court \u2013 that was a big hurdle.\u201d \u201cPart of it is just having patience and realizing that it\u2019s not all going to come at once. I think as long as I can do things when I\u2019m out there on the court that can help us get wins, then I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d At first glance, sporting Sixers colors seems like a bizarre choice for a Celtic. But Jaylen Brown wasn\u2019t sporting just any red-and-blue mismatched shoes. Those were a pair of the venerable Adidas T-Mac IIIs , worn by Brown\u2019s idol Tracy McGrady for the 2004 All-Star Game. Pay homage to a legend and look awesome doing it? Enemy colors or not, that\u2019s how you make a statement on opening night. Honorable mention \u2014 Jayson Tatum and Jordan Bell .   \u201cThis is not a rivalry. I don\u2019t know our record against them, but it\u2019s pretty bad. They always kick our ass.\u201d \u2013 Embiid, after the Celtics rolled to their 19th victory in the past 22 meetings with the Sixers. Think hard. You\u2019ll get it eventually. (Hint: Jalen Rose used to play for the Raptors. Hint No. 2: Rose and the Raptors once had a really, really bad encounter with Kobe Bryant.) Custom slippers and PJs to the season opener? Custom slippers and PJs to the season opener! You do you, Draymond. Security personnel at Oracle Arena apparently take their job very, very seriously.  To quote Sidney Deane , it\u2019s so pretty! The Warriors spared no expenses for their latest championship rings, coming up with an array of unique features that includes what is purported to be the first reversible face in the history of commemorative sports jewelry. Thus, a new NBA meme was born. Rookie mistake, Russ. The camera sees all. And out in L.A., LeBron James bides his time and prepares for an opener of his own on Thursday.

He has five as a player ( three with the Bulls , two with the Spurs) and three as coach of the Warriors. Technically, Kerr ranks No. 3 in rings among those currently earning an NBA paycheck; Jerry West (a consultant with the LA Clippers) has nine and Mitch Kupchak (general manager of the Charlotte Hornets) has 10, but those are front-office types. Given his visibility and on-court impact, Kerr is building an impressive collection and it could grow, maybe enough to challenge the 11 owned by his former coach Phil Jackson. (Bill Russell also has 11.) Kerr recently spoke to NBA.com \u2018s Shaun Powell on all things rings \u2026 * * * There\u2019s no pecking order to my rings. They don\u2019t all look the same, but they\u2019re all the same kind of special. I don\u2019t look at a ring for that play I made in \u201997 when Michael Jordan threw me the ball for that shot , or what happened in the games. When you\u2019re part of a team, you\u2019re part of the team, no matter what your role is or how little or how much you played. You think back to the memories of that season, and the memories usually come down to people. It\u2019s more like, in \u201996 for example, that was a 72-win team, the first year Michael was back full time, we had Dennis Rodman and all of his haircuts. Putting that team together was amazing. What an experience. That\u2019s what that ring means to me, how crazy that whole season was.  I can say something about each team I\u2019ve been with and each ring I won with them. My first ring with the Spurs, I barely played in the playoffs but that ring means so much to me because I loved so many of the guys. Sean Elliott was my great friend from college, and to win a ring with Sean, I didn\u2019t do much but I was on the team with him. And Will Purdue, I was with him in Chicago. Neither one of us played much with the Spurs but in the locker room we were like, \u2018Here we are together again. Got another ring!\u2019 * Powell:  Warriors ready to receive newest piece of jewelry I\u2019ve got five rings in a safe deposit box in San Diego, where I have a home, and a couple up here in Oakland, soon to add a third. They have yet to all meet each other. I\u2019m looking forward to having a family reunion. I do need to bring them all together and take a photo.  I\u2019m not a jewelry guy. I don\u2019t wear a watch. I don\u2019t even wear a wedding ring and I\u2019ve been happily married for 28 years. My wife doesn\u2019t mind. I just don\u2019t like stuff on my hands, my wrist. I proudly show them if people ask, but I don\u2019t really wear them. Well, that\u2019s not completely true. I wore them on Halloween about 13 years ago. Wore them to a party. I went as Eminem. Wore all five rings. Went with the jewelry look, along with the rest of the rapper getup. The reaction from people at the party? Utter shock and disbelief. They get bigger and gaudier year after year. The size is just ridiculous. They\u2019re not something to wear, they\u2019re something to show. I remember my teammate Jud Buechler, when we were at the parade after the third Bulls title. We hadn\u2019t gotten the next ring yet, of course. I said, \u2018Do you think the third will be gaudier than the first two?\u2019 He said, \u2018I sure hope so.\u2019 At the celebration of the fifth championship, my last year with the Spurs in 2003, I brought along my other four rings. I was really doing it to make my teammates laugh, especially Stephen Jackson and Tim Duncan. I put all four on and we were at the Alamodome and it was a big scene. A stiff white guy, a suburban white kid like me talking about my bling and walking around acting like I had some game. Stephen loved it so much. The feeling is so amazing when you win. Our guys will tell you the same thing: You want to feel it again. It\u2019s been a nine-month haul. So much happens on a personal level and team level during that time. There\u2019s this emotion, so much adversity. You lose playoff games and you go home feeling drained but when you win and the buzzer sounds and you realize you\u2019re the champs, well, I tell our guys there\u2019s a reason you pour champagne on your heads. It\u2019s a feeling of relief. At every ring ceremony, I always have my eyes on those guys who\u2019ve never won a ring. Like when David West went out to the middle of the court and got his last year. And JaVale McGee. Those guys have been in the league a long time. Guys get emotional. It\u2019s so gratifying. When you\u2019re on a team like this one, or the Bulls in the \u201990s, part of the rallying cry each year \u2014 remember, you\u2019re always searching for motivation \u2014 is, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get so-and-so a ring.\u2019 Michael Jordan talked about it all the time. This year for us it\u2019s DeMarcus Cousins and Jonas Jerebko and maybe a few others. It would mean the world to them. I can tell you if we are lucky enough to do it again this year, I would look at DeMarcus. That\u2019s who I would have my eye on. This is a guy who was basically a week away from signing a max deal and then tore his Achilles, and his career all of a sudden is in flux. He\u2019s been working his tail off for nine months. Still not out here practicing. So much frustration. I know how emotional it would be for him if we could win another title. It would be amazing and special to see his reaction when he got that ring. * * *"},{"id":38135,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-championship-ring","date":"2018-10-16","title":"Warriors eager to add latest, greatest championship ring to growing collection","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Thunder vs. Warriors, 10:30 ET OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The brass ring of sports isn\u2019t made of brass, but precious metals and memories. Ask anyone who owns one \u2014 let\u2019s go with the Golden State Warriors, who are on pace to create their own jewelry store \u2014 and they\u2019ll say it\u2019s well worth its weight and the wait. It is the championship ring, that finger candy sitting at the end of a seasonal journey, ready to be claimed. The ring stands as a symbol of skill, hard work and of course envy. It says to those who aren\u2019t wearing it: You weren\u2019t good enough. The Warriors, of course, were plenty good enough. Too much, actually, for the rest of the field in three of the last four season. Last June they swept the Cleveland Cavaliers in The Finals to earn more Silver \u2014 as in Adam, the NBA commissioner who\u2019ll honor the defending champs on Opening Night \u2014 and gold, as in, well, you know what\u2019s coming their way. Actually, you don\u2019t. Not yet, anyway. See, that\u2019s the thing with the ring: The design and diamond and carat count is always shrouded in mystery until the proper time, when the unveiling is done pregame, right before another season tips off. That way, goes the reasoning, the players can see it for the first time, the shock of which causes their jaws to hit the floor before their sneakers do. It\u2019s called: Preserving the \u201ceyeball-bursting\u201d effect. All three rings won by the Warriors in the Stephen Curry\/Klay Thompson\/Draymond Green era do have one common denominator: They were crafted and constructed by Jason\u2019s of Beverly Hills , who might be the LeBron James of the jewelry business. Working with yellow and white gold, white diamonds, sapphires and blue enamel, the company specializes in glam and does quite a bit of business with NBA players, including LeBron and a few Warriors, and therefore is a perfect fit. It\u2019s run by owner and designer Jason Arasheben , who caters to royal families around the world and many celebrities (Nas, Rihanna, Lil Jon). His track record is impressive and his list of well-heeled clients runs deep. His most expensive ring and earring creations are $6 million; he says his biggest spenders \u201care typically those you won\u2019t find on Page Six,\u201d although there are perks gained by catering to the famous. Before Michael Jackson died, the King of Pop summoned Jason to his home to help create a family crest piece. \u201cTo sit across from a legend and have the opportunity to design with him was a very special experience and one I won\u2019t forget,\u201d Arasheben said. Although his company mainly creates fashionable pieces, he was raised on the Lakers and, therefore, sports championship rings tap into a different creative spirit. \u201cI enjoy designing jewelry no matter who it is for, but being a huge sports fan, making championship jewelry has a special place in my heart,\u201d Arasheben said. \u201cI really enjoy the storytelling that comes from the design of these kind of rings. Championship rings take a lot more creative thought, because you have to take into account the entire team into the design. The ring needs to tell the story of the season and each player involved.\u201d The Warriors\u2019 rings are somewhat of a collaboration between team and jeweler. The club tosses around some ideas and then Arasheben does what he do. From concept to creation takes eight weeks.  The rings are deeply personal and designed to depict the entire seasonal journey, not just the night the champagne splashed. The chore of chronicling this is the duty of Kirk Lacob, the Warriors\u2019 assistant general manager and son of Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob. He takes into account the various checkpoints of the championship run and, with input from players and others, develops a signature blueprint for the rings. \u201cOur goal is to commemorate the season,\u201d Lacob said. \u201cYou do that by utilizing symbolism and specific imagery that will activate those memories. Each season has its own personality. The first season was about coming from where we were before. It was the first championship in 40 years and it was about the long road for everybody. The second championship was more delicate; for some of the newcomers, like Kevin Durant, it was a recognition of a lifelong dream. For others it was about getting something back because we\u2019d lost the year before.\u201d And this year? Lacob offers several hints: \u201cThe majority of players went back-to-back (championships) so they wanted to remember back-to-back. Also the struggles we went through; we didn\u2019t win 60 games and ultimately we overcame all that to sweep The Finals. They had not done that yet. And finally, we also wanted an ode to the team\u2019s history playing in Oakland. They wanted that to be memorialized.\u201d The typical sports championship ring decades ago wasn\u2019t that much different than a high school class ring. It made note of the year, used a precious stone as a centerpiece, skimped on the diamonds and that was about it. Pretty dull. The Warriors\u2019 1975 ring, for example, contained just one diamond and nothing on the face except \u201cNBA World Champions.\u201d Such simplicity has gone the way of Chuck Taylor white high tops. Today, rings are true works of art, craftsmanship at its splashiest. They give the player name, number, year, team logo, an image of the Larry O\u2019Brien NBA Championship Trophy. A nd that\u2019s just for starters. Then it gets funky. The Lakers\u2019 2009 ring had silhouettes of the player\u2019s face engraved on the side, for example. It\u2019s now in vogue to include a slogan or motto that was embraced by the team and community \u2014 \u201cStrength In Numbers,\u201d for example, a phrase favored by Kerr, found its way on the first ring of this Warriors\u2019 title streak. That\u2019s a lot of letters and numerals and imagery for finger jewelry, but the Warriors and Arasheben make it work. \u201cIf there\u2019s an inside joke, we\u2019ll throw that in there, too. You want everybody from that season to feel their ring is special,\u201d said Lacob. \u201cThese rings are a tangible way to bring up memories so they are never lost.\u201d As a result of the increased details, rings have mushroomed in size, to the point where they\u2019re diamond-crusted walnuts. They make it difficult, if not impossible, to ball a fist while wearing it. \u201c We \u2019re approaching a point where we can\u2019t get any bigger, and designers now have to focus more on the innovation and design of the rings than ever before,\u201d said Arasheben. The 2015 ring was done in classic white diamonds (240, to match the then-total number of wins by the Lacob ownership group), with the player\u2019s number and the Bay Bridge done in gold trim. Four stones can only be seen in black light; they match the number of titles the franchise, which dates back to Philadelphia, had won at that point. On one side of the ring is a group of hands hoisting the trophy. Inside the ring is a shout-out to Oracle Arena by mimicking the beams that crisscross the arena\u2019s ceiling.  The 2017 ring has the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy on its face, and XVI-I branded on the side, representing the team\u2019s 16-1 run through the playoffs. That ring was 11 carats and contained more diamonds than any made by any other major American professional team, claims Arasheben. While playing it coy about what awaits the Warriors on Tuesday, he says: \u201cThis year we took it a step further and included a design element that has never been done before in championship jewelry.\u201d So stay tuned. There\u2019s also value in the ring\u2019s box, which are crafted with the same care as its cargo. \u201cWe put a lot of time and effort into the presentation of the rings,\u201d said Arasheben. \u201cIt is important to display jewelry in the right light. We contracted the best box makers to construct a box with LED lights that really highlighted the diamonds and a revolving platform that shows off the ring from every angle.\u201d In recent years, some championship teams started spreading the wealth and handing out rings to every team employee. The Miami Heat went a step further during the Big Three era by giving rings to arena workers. Obviously these rings, while not the kind you\u2019d find in a box of Cracker Jack, aren\u2019t of the same quality as what the players get.  The Warriors have multiple tiers of rings: Those given to the players, the coaching staff, team administration, sales office, etc., all differing in diamond count and weight and design. \u201cEvery full-time employee gets one,\u201d said Lacob. \u201cWe do something for part-timers. We do something for major partners. We have a lot of different options, with earrings and pendants. We want something for everyone who was involved. We want everyone who was a part of that journey to feel like it. Obviously that\u2019s a lot but it\u2019s something we feel strongly about.\u201d Of course, there\u2019s the obvious question: Given all that goes into a championship ring these days, what\u2019s the cost? Well, trying to get that information from the Warriors is tougher than trying to deny them a championship. \u201cI have a good sense,\u201d Lacob said. The person who would know about the bottom line prefers to put it in perspective. \u201cThese rings would be considered priceless,\u201d Arasheben said, \u201cbecause they are more than just a jewelry piece. They are a piece of sports history.\u201d On Tuesday, history will put a bow on last season by putting the ring on their finger. Adam Silver will say a few words to an adoring Oracle Arena crowd and then as each player and member of the coaching and front office staff steps forward, one by one, the ring presentation will begin. \u201cQuite honestly, it\u2019s the weirdest night of the year,\u201d said Warriors guard Stephen Curry. \u201cWe celebrate something that happened four months ago, and then you appreciate the moment, see the banner unfurled, feel the energy from the crowd. Then you got to put the ring back, go warm up for two and a half minutes and play a game where the other team is just salivating, just waiting to get a hold of you. You can\u2019t relax after you get the ring because it\u2019s old news by that point.\u201d In the perfect Warriors\u2019 world, Curry and Durant and Kerr keep stretching this championship run and force the owners to keep writing fat checks to Jason\u2019s. That would make everyone happy and make Lacob\u2019s job much more challenging. \u201cWe see these rings as an evolution, and if that happens, if we keep winning, I\u2019m going to get short on ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we have this problem.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The sides had until 6 p.m. on Monday to work out terms for the deal or Nance would have become an unrestricted free agent in 2019. Once the agreement was secured, Nance signed his contract in front of Cavaliers employees on the indoor practice court in Quicken Loans Arena. After being introduced by general manager Koby Altman, Nance addressed his basketball family. \u201cI haven\u2019t come up with the word for it yet,\u201d said Nance, wearing a T-shirt with \u201cHOME\u201d on the front. \u201cSurreal doesn\u2019t even cut it.

He helped Cleveland reach its fourth straight NBA Finals and the Cavs view him as one of their core players as they try to stay competitive while James starts anew out West with the Lakers. For Nance, an Akron native like James, Cleveland is the only place he ever wanted to be. \u201cI was the only person to live in L.A. and vacation in Cleveland,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can vacation where I live.\u201d Nance averaged 8.9 points and 7.0 rebounds in 24 games last season. He\u2019s expected to share starting duties this season with Tristan Thompson as coach Tyronn Lue plans to match up with the other team\u2019s big men. Nance\u2019s dad, Larry Sr., was an All-Star with the Cavs from 1987-94 and the first winner of the All-Star dunk contest in 1984. His jersey was retired by Cleveland in 1995, but the team chose to let the younger Nance wear it when he came over last season."},{"id":38096,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/booker-expected-play-suns-opener","date":"2018-10-16","title":"Kokoskov says Booker will return for Suns opener","content":" Suns head coach Igor Kokoskov said Monday that star shooting guard Devin Booker, five weeks after hand surgery, will return to play in Wednesday\u2019s season opener against the Mavericks. \u201cDevin\u2019s going to play on Wednesday,\u201d Kokoskov told Phoenix\u2019s 98.7 FM . \u201cThere\u2019s no secret.

Whether or not he suits up for the team\u2019s season-opener on Thursday against the Miami Heat ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) remains unknown. Howard was sidelined for the preseason with pain in his lower back, an injury that forced the big man to be a spectator in every Wizards practice and exhibition game to date. He was diagnosed with a piriformis injury, which is a muscle in the lower buttocks. He was, however, able to go through all of today\u2019s practice and sounded somewhat iffy for the season-opener. Howard told reporters Monday that he wasn\u2019t sure if he would be ready to suit up against the Heat, but he also did not rule out a return. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to make myself available for all 82 games but the main thing is making sure that I\u2019m healthy for the rest of the season,\u201d Howard said. Wizards coach Scott Brooks was pleased with how Howard fared in practice, but wasn\u2019t ready to commit to a return date for the big man. \u201cWe just want to continue to build on what we did today,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThen, we will get together with Dwight and our staff and medical team and make the best decision for him going forward. That\u2019s still days away. You always want to have day after day of work and see how he feels the next day and we\u2019ll go from there. As of today, he looked really good. He did everything we did \u2014 he didn\u2019t skip any drills. He\u2019s a pretty good player.\u201d Candace Buckner of The Washington Post reports that before last week\u2019s preseason game in New York, Brooks was asked if \u201cit was safe to say\u201d Howard won\u2019t play in the opener if he missed the preseason slate. Brooks\u2019 response? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s safe.\u201d Last season, Howard ranked third in the NBA in rebounds per game (12.5), fourth in double-doubles (53), ninth in blocks (1.6) and 11th in field-goal percentage (55.5 percent). Howard\u2019s most impressive game of the 2017-18 season came on March 21, when he finished with 32 points and a career-high 30 rebounds in a comeback win against the Nets. Howard was traded by the Hornets to the Nets in the offseason. Brooklyn waived him shortly thereafter, allowing Howard to sign with the Wizards. After spending the first eight seasons of his career with the Orlando Magic, Howard has played for the Los Angeles Lakers (2012-13), the Houston Rockets (2013-16), the Atlanta Hawks (2016-17) and the Hornets (2017-18) since then.

While his future with Minnesota remains an unknown at this point, he has reportedly come to an agreement with ownership about his relationship there going forward. Per The Athletic\u2019s Jon Krawczynski and the Star Tribune \u2018s Kent Youngblood, Wolves owner Glen Taylor met with Butler to discuss the trade talk \u2014 and Butler\u2019s volatile return to practice last week \u2014 as a new season approaches.

Here\u2019s more from Youngblood on the reported talk between the two men : The Timberwolves open their 2018-19 season on Wednesday in San Antonio ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). When asked after yesterday\u2019s practice if he planned to play in that game, Butler said: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll be breathing tomorrow. I\u2019m just taking it one day at a time.\u201d He was said his relationship with team management has not changed, but when asked if he still wanted to be traded, he smiled and said \u201cmaybe.\u201d When asked if he expects to be traded, he also said \u201cmaybe.\u201d As for his relationship with Taylor, Butler said the \u201ccommunication is there.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, he [Taylor] expects me to go out there and win some basketball games. I think that\u2019s why my team expects me to do,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Minnesota as a fan base expects me to do. Go out there and compete and be the fun-loving basketball player that I am. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be.\u201d Butler had been absent for most of training camp and the preseason after he requested a trade from the team in September. Despite weeks of trade rumors and speculation, it appears Butler will begin the regular season on the Timberwolves. Butler said after Sunday\u2019s practice that he remains committed to helping the Wolves win as long as he is on the team. \u201cThat was my message to everybody,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal. Especially to my guys. We\u2019re the ones who have to run up and down this court every single day. I make sure to remind them every single day that I\u2019m paying attention.

So please, come on with it.\u201d Butler returned to the team last week for a contentious practice where he reportedly called out his coaches, teammates and the front office.

You have to think \u2026 I haven\u2019t played played basketball in so long,\u201d Butler told Nichols. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so passionate. And I love the game. And I don\u2019t do it for any other reason except to compete and go up against the best to try to prove that I can hang. So all of my emotion came out at one time. Was it the right way to do it? No. But I can\u2019t control that when I\u2019m out there competing. That\u2019s my love of the game. That\u2019s raw me. Me at my finest, my purest.

Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and two steals per game for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth.

More importantly, Denver was close and young, which means they should only get better internally. Nikola Jokic is one of the best young centers in the league. The Nuggets signed Paul Millsap in 2017 to add defense and a veteran presence. They have a trio of talented guards in Jamal Murray, Gary Harris and Will Barton, all of whom are capable of scoring 20 points a night. Biggest question marks:  Who\u2019s the point guard? Or is that question too archaic for a team boasting Jokic\u2019s passing skills in the middle? Can Denver\u2019s youthful talent thrive under the playoffs-or-bust pressure from within the franchise? * * * 2017-18 record:  58-24 Why they want to win now:  They\u2019re the two-time defending champs, but \u201cthree-peat\u201d sounds way cooler. * Powell:  Warriors aim for fifth straight West title  Biggest question mark:  What will it take to prevent the Warriors from winning it all again? * * * 2017-18 record:  65-17 Why they want to win now:  Houston was (maybe) a Chris Paul hamstring away from The Finals. Now they\u2019re reloading to finish the job, this time with Carmelo Anthony\u2019s potentially game-swinging offense in tow. Championship windows are short, and the Rockets are intent on keeping this one jammed open as long as possible. Biggest question marks:  The odds are next to nothing that Houston misses the postseason, but its ultimate goal faces a series of different questions in 2018-19. How much will the Rockets miss Luc Mbah a Moute and Trevor Ariza? Can Anthony stay on the floor if opposing offenses single him out? If not, who finishes the game? And can someone send Paul a good luck charm to simply stay healthy come playoff time? * * * 2017-18 record:  42-40 Why they want to win now:  \u201cLob City\u201d is long gone, but the Clippers remained surprisingly competitive behind Kia Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams . Tobias Harris is one of the more underrated forwards in the league. Danilo Gallinari looked good (and healthy!) in the preseason. Marcin Gortat is a serviceable big man. Patrick Beverley and Avery Bradley offer defense-first leadership to complement rookie guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jerome Robinson. Biggest question marks:  Can their sum total of players overachieve to keep the Clippers afloat in a Western Conference overflowing with star power? Can Williams duplicate his 2017-18 production (22.6 ppg)? And, if bad health pays them another visit, can the Clippers keep up in the playoff race? 2017-18 record:  35-47 Why they want to win now:  Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson is in charge and LeBron James is in town. Biggest question mark:  What do you trust more about the current Lakers roster: its promise or pitfalls? Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma have shown ample flashes of potential. JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley once did the same, only to become NBA journeymen. It\u2019s up to James and coach Luke Walton to figure out what formula works best on such a uniquely-constructed team. * * * 2017-18 record:  22-60 Why they want to win now:  Mike Conley is back and healthy. Ditto for Chandler Parsons ( 7-for-15 on 3-pointers in the preseason). Marc Gasol is 33 years old and still more than effective. Signing Kyle Anderson to a multi-year deal was a win-now move. Biggest question mark:  What will Jaren Jackson Jr. provide? He looked like a man-child in NBA Summer League , but foul trouble plagued him in the preseason. If the fourth overall pick can\u2019t contribute consistently, the rest of the big man duties fall to JaMychal Green or small-ball options such as Wayne Selden, Garrett Temple, Marshon Brooks or Dillon Brooks. * * * 2017-18 record:  47-35 Why they want to win now:  After snapping a 14-year playoff drought, the Timberwolves are in no hurry to return to the lottery. They shouldn\u2019t be, not with Karl-Anthony Towns earning his first All-Star nod and a new contract extension . Andrew Wiggins enters the first year of his own extension, while veteran point guard Jeff Teague offers the stable point guard play that many young teams lack. Biggest question mark:  When and how does the Jimmy Butler situation resolve itself? His on-court effect, especially on defense, isn\u2019t up for debate. He matters, but if his trade request stands, today\u2019s Timberwolves could look very different tomorrow. The question is what Minnesota ultimately gets back for him \u2014 assuming they choose to trade him at all. * * * 2017-18 record:  48-34 Why they want to win now:  Anthony Davis. Biggest question mark:  Jrue Holiday was the feel-good story of last year\u2019s playoffs, but it\u2019s up to him to prove that his career year was more than just that. Last season marked the first time since 2012-13 that Holiday played more than 70 games. Signing Julius Randle further strengthened the frontcourt behind Davis, but will not addressing a thin rotation of shooters ultimately prove their undoing? * * * 2017-18 record:  48-34 Why they want to win now:  After losing Kevin Durant two summers ago, the Thunder have secured consecutive long-term contracts with Russell Westbrook and Paul George. They\u2019re not going anywhere. So how far can they go? Biggest question marks:  There\u2019s a lot of them. Will trading Carmelo Anthony be a case of addition by subtraction? Will the real crunch-time power forward (Patrick Patterson, Jerami Grant) please stand up? Will their defense continue to suffer until Andre Roberson returns? Can Dennis Schroder play in the same backcourt as Westbrook? All that being said, a foundation of Westbrook, George and Steven Adams is a great place to start. * * * 2017-18 record:  21-61 Why they want to win now:  Owner Robert Sarver said recently, \u201cI think we\u2019re at the end of a rebuild. For me, the switch has flipped and it\u2019s now time to start figuring out how to win.\u201d When he says it\u2019s time to win, odds are the team will try to do just that. Biggest question marks:  Why now? Because Sarver believes Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Josh Jackson are ready to lead kind of leap? Because adding Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson will make that big of a difference? Because new coach Igor Kokoskov is the league\u2019s next great coach waiting to happen? If at least two of those things don\u2019t happen, it\u2019s hard to see Phoenix \u2014 a team that finished last in both offense and defense last season \u2014 improving enough to surpass anyone out West. * * * 2017-18 record:  49-33 Why they want to win now:  First Team All-NBA guards are a rare breed, and Portland has one in Damian Lillard. CJ McCollum is an All-Star-caliber scorer in his own right. For now, Portland deems that backcourt enough of a reason to table any thoughts of hitting the reset button. Biggest question mark:  The Blazers locked up center Jusuf Nurkic with a long-term deal over the summer. That leaves the other frontcourt spots, which boast Maurice Harkless, Evan Turner, Al-Farouq Aminu and Jake Layman. Can at least two of them become overachieving role players that enhance the overall mix and chemistry of the team, especially come playoff time? * * * 2017-18 record:  27-55 Why they want to win now:  The Kings don\u2019t own their 2019 draft pick and there is nothing more dangerous than a team with nothing to lose. Just ask the Cavaliers, Thunder, 76ers, Blazers and Jazz, all of whom lost to the Nets last season. Biggest question mark:  The Kings have drafted just one All-Star since 1997 (DeMarcus Cousins). Can Marvin Bagley, De\u2019Aaron Fox or Willie Cauley-Stein exhibit the kind of franchise-changing talent Sacramento needs to finally turn the ship around? * * * 2017-18 record:  47-35 Why they want to win now:  The Spurs won 47 games without their best player and added DeMar DeRozan to that team. They haven\u2019t missed the playoffs since 1997. Gregg Popovich. Biggest question marks:  Can a team with so many mid-range specialists succeed in today\u2019s NBA? Will age set in for LaMarcus Aldridge or Pau Gasol? How well can Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes hold down the backcourt with Dejounte Murray and Derrick White out? * * * 2017-18 record:  48-34 Why they want to win now:  Donovan Mitchell is a star now, and the assumption is he will only get better in Year Two. Rudy Gobert single-handedly morphs the Jazz into the stingiest defensive team in the league. Joe Ingles is an underrated source of production. Ditto for Derrick Favors. Quin Snyder is a future Coach of the Year award contender. Biggest question marks:  Will Mitchell improve on an incredible rookie season (and even better postseason)? Can Gobert stay healthy? Can Utah count on at least two reserves for consistently efficient production and impact? * * * > More from Shiny & New Week Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

That was more or less the case for the decades after the Warriors\u2019 mid-1970s peak, which culminated with a surprising run to the NBA title in 1975 . Hiccups of fun interrupted the misery along the way. Joe Barry Carroll and Sleepy Floyd snapped a nine-year playoff drought in 1987. \u201cRun TMC\u201d \u2014 the high-scoring trio of Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin \u2014 invigorated the fans base from 1989-91 , although their run amounted to just one playoff series win. The \u201cWe Believe\u201d Warriors of 2006-07 rocked the NBA with an upset of top-seeded Dallas in the first round, but that party train quickly ran aground in the Western Conference semifinals against Utah. * Powell:  Warriors show no sign of relenting in West It is largely because those blips of success were so few and far between that they are remembered so fondly \u2014 and why this current dynasty has blind-sided the rest of the league. How we got from the depressing \u201cthere\u201d to the historic \u201chere\u201d is a series of steps carved from a combination of good fortune and the intelligence to take advantage of said fortune. Nail that combination enough times, and an NBA team can find itself built on a foundation of contention for years to come. And man, did the Warriors nail it \u2026 It\u2019s unclear whom the Warriors expected to take with the No. 7 pick in the 2009 draft. What is clear is that they were headed toward using that pick on behalf of another team. Ironically, Golden State was negotiating with then-Suns general manager Steve Kerr to trade their pick and a package of players to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for All-Star forward Amar\u2019e Stoudemire . Both teams were forced to wait until Minnesota used its back-to-back picks (Nos. 5 and 6). When the Timberwolves chose a pair of point guards not named Stephen Curry (Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio), the Suns draft room erupted in cheers. So did the Warriors, who quickly canceled the advanced trade talks in order to keep the future two-time Kia MVP. \u201cI think we felt like from our side that if Steph dropped to seven where they were picking that we were going to get a deal done,\u201d Kerr reflected years later. \u201cThat\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d Of course, Kerr eventually did get his man. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves \u2026 Bob Myers grew up a Warriors fan in Oakland before earning respect as a professional agent during his adult career. But even with those credentials \u2014 and a few kind words delivered by Danny Ainge \u2014 Myers later admitted he \u201cfully expected to be denied\u201d when he approached Warriors owner Joe Lacob in 2010 about possibly working for the team. Lacob, however, was intent on permanently changing the culture around Golden State. He pegged Myers as a central figure in that process and hired him to eventually succeed then-general manager Larry Riley. That succession took place just one year later , cementing Myers as a leading decision-maker for a dynasty that was just beginning to take shape. Golden State missed on its 2010 first-round pick (Ekpe Udoh at No. 6), but it recovered by selecting future All-Star Klay Thompson at No. 11 the following summer. The decision was not universally lauded as the Warriors already had Curry and Monta Ellis in the backcourt. But Golden State ignored 1) the appeal of best fit via defensive-minded forwards like Marcus Morris or Kawhi Leonard and 2) San Antonio\u2019s last-minute efforts to trade up for Thompson. Luck played a role here, as well. The three teams drafting immediately before the Warriors all opted for other sources of backcourt scoring. Ellis or Curry? The answer wasn\u2019t nearly as clear in the moment as it is in hindsight. Ellis, a key member of that beloved \u201cWe Believe\u201d squad of 2007, was averaging more than 20 points per game for the third consecutive season. Plus, he was just 26 years old. Curry\u2019s ankles, meanwhile, had already shown significant signs of being injury prone, reducing him to just 26 games in 2011-12. Those ankles, however, wound up being a blessing in hindsight. Riley later reflected that Curry\u2019s injuries might have scared off Milwaukee, which ultimately accepted a trade package of Ellis and Udoh in exchange for defensive-minded center Andrew Bogut. The trade cemented Curry as Golden State\u2019s lead guard while simultaneously fortifying a porous frontcourt \u2014 a winning formula the Warriors have relied on ever since. Again, luck matters, and it might never have mattered more for the Warriors as we know them than on this date. Golden State owed a top-seven protected pick after acquiring Marcus Williams from New Jersey in 2008. The Nets then conveyed that Warriors pick to Utah in 2011 as part of the Jazz\u2019s trade for All-Star point guard Deron Williams. Golden State, however, was desperate to ensure the pick remain in their hands. On April 26, 2012 \u2014 the final night of the season \u2014 the Warriors ran out a starting lineup of Chris Wright, Jeremy Tyler, Mickell Gladness, Charles Jenkins and Thompson against the San Antonio Spurs. Golden State\u2019s 107-101 loss assured it of the league\u2019s seventh-worst record heading into draft lottery. The lottery balls did the rest on May 30 , and the Warriors found themselves remaining at No. 7 \u2014 allowing them to keep what would be a franchise-altering Draft pick. While Curry and Thompson get the headlines and nicknames (see: \u201cSplash Brothers\u201d), the players selected in the 2012 draft helped define the modern-day Warriors as much as anyone else. Golden State pounced on North Carolina\u2019s Harrison Barnes at No. 7 , giving them a slash-and-shoot forward to complete their perimeter rotation. The Warriors then completed one of the most difficult tasks in the NBA by hitting on not one, but two picks outside the lottery. Golden State took Vanderbilt big man Festus Ezeli at No. 30 and Michigan State prospect Draymond Green at No. 35 . Ezeli would go on to become a valuable backup behind Bogut during the Warriors\u2019 first championship run in 2014-15. Green, meanwhile, was a future All-Star hidden in the kind of 6-foot-7 frame that was once dubiously dubbed as a \u201ctweener\u201d build \u2014 too slow to play on the perimeter but not tall enough to man the paint. Instead, Green used his skill and instincts to become one of the most versatile players in the league. But again, we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves. After choosing to make Curry a vital part of the franchise just seven months earlier, the Warriors were determined to make that decision long term. They did not do so blindly, however. Golden State was well aware of Curry\u2019s ankle issues, which had required two arthroscopic surgeries. The 6-foot-3 guard had sprained his ankle again just 12 days earlier . The risk was clearly worth it for the Warriors, who ultimately offered Curry a four-year extension worth roughly $44 million . \u201cFor our group, the consensus was, yeah, we might be wrong in that he might not be healthy and he might not reach his full potential,\u201d Myers reflected years later. \u201cBut let\u2019s bet on him. And if we\u2019re wrong, we\u2019re wrong.\u201d They weren\u2019t. Curry wound up winning back-to-back Kia MVP awards on that contract. More importantly, his salary allowed Golden State to create cap space that would pay off handsomely down the road. By now, Golden State was viewed as a Western Conference up-and-comer. The young Warriors, in their second playoff appearance since 1994, had pushed the Spurs to six games in the 2013 West semis . Now they had their eye the kind of veteran presence they had just seen up close in the playoffs: then-Denver Nuggets swingman Andre Iguodala. The former All-Star was just as eager to join move to the Bay Area, but the Warriors were strapped for cap room and found few avenues through which to create any. Finally, with Iguodala on the verge of signing with Dallas, the Warriors completed a three-team trade that allowed them to dump salary at the cost of four draft picks (two first-rounders and two second-rounders). The price was steep, but it helped Golden State secure a selfless, defense-first presence that ultimately unlocked the position-less lineups that have broken opposing gameplans for four seasons running. New York or Oakland? That was the choice facing Steve Kerr, a former NBA player, general manager and TNT NBA analyst who was now readying for the coaching phase of his career. He had his pick between the Warriors and the Knicks, with the latter boasting his own former coach and Hall-of-Famer Phil Jackson as team president. Jackson\u2019s pull, however, ultimately wasn\u2019t enough against Golden State\u2019s young core, contract offer or proximity to Kerr\u2019s San Diego home. All of those factors helped net the man who would eventually help unlock the Warriors\u2019 shooting and passing to their full, devastating extent. Injuries are never good in a vacuum, but their ripple effects can sometimes lead to surprisingly positive adjustments. Such was the case on this night, when starting forward David Lee came up hobbling with a strained hamstring in a preseason game. The injury forced Kerr to start Green at power forward to begin the 2014-15 campaign. Though the former second-round pick had shown flashes in his first two seasons, no one expected the Swiss Army knife of defense, passing and competitiveness Green became once unleashed. His promotion became permanent, and is viewed as one of the key turning points of Golden State blossoming from good to great. A massive new television deal for the NBA meant more money for everyone. The league, however, attempted to smooth the projected spike of incoming cash over several years so as to avoid a temporary \u2014 and ultimately significant \u2014 blip in the salary cap. On this date, the National Basketball Players Association rejected two smoothing proposals from the league. This meant that the bulk of the incoming money would be injected all at once in the summer of 2016. Two consequences emerged from this development: The second consequence wound up dramatically benefiting the soon-to-be-champion Warriors just 17 months later. Fresh off a devastating Game 7 defeat to Cleveland in the 2016 Finals , Golden State was eager to bounce back in unprecedented fashion. The Warriors had their eyes set on adding league-altering talent to a group that was already good enough to win an NBA-record 73 games . Kevin Durant witnessed that group up close in the Western Conference finals, where his Thunder squandered a 3-1 series lead to Curry ( now a two-time Kia MVP ) and the Warriors. Golden State\u2019s playing style appealed to Durant, and more importantly, the league\u2019s 2016 cap spike gave the Warriors enough money to sign him. The former Kia MVP and four-time scoring champion took advantage of the rare opportunity, giving the Warriors an unprecedented collection of shooting and pure talent. It\u2019s important to note, however, that even the cap spike would not have been enough for the Warriors to sign Durant had Dallas not been willing to take on Bogut\u2019s contract in exchange for a second-round pick. Since then, the Warriors have reeled off consecutive NBA championships and are heavy favorites to win it all again in 2018-19. More dates of significance loom on the horizon, particularly as Durant and Thompson approach free agency next summer. If the last few years are any indication, the Warriors are getting pretty good making the right call. * * * > More from Shiny & New Week The views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting."},{"id":38188,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-quest-fifth-straight-west-title","date":"2018-10-15","title":"Warriors' dominance in Western Conference shows no sign of relenting","content":" We have reached the point in this Golden State Warriors\u2019 chokehold on the Western Conference where it turns spooky: The last team out West to deny the Warriors (technically) no longer exists. Yes, the LA Clippers are still right where they\u2019ve always been. But all other traces of May 3, 2014, when they beat the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs , have turned to dust. Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, JJ Redick, DeAndre Jordan, Jamal Crawford \u2014 they\u2019re all gone. Usually, it\u2019s the loser who feels the cold repercussions and fallout of a first-round defeat in the playoffs. But what\u2019s often lost as the Warriors run the table in the West is how they\u2019ve shattered so many teams, schemes and dreams along the way. In hindsight, four years ago was not the beginning of \u201cLob City\u201d and the Clippers. It was the beginning of their end. The wreckage left behind by the Warriors over the ensuing 53 months underlines the undeniable truth: They\u2019ve taken ownership of their very own West Side Story. They had a record-setting 73-win regular season . They\u2019ve won 12 straight West payoff series (and 15 of 16 playoff series overall). Only twice \u2013 the West finals in 2016 and \u201918 \u2014 did they endure the indignity of needing to survive Game 7 in the West playoffs. In short, this dynasty shows no signs of dying this season. If anything, the argument can be made \u2014 even before it\u2019s proven as fact \u2014 that the 2018-19 Warriors are their most talented team yet. All-Stars Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson welcomed a fifth, DeMarcus Cousins, to their mix this summer. That is not typical in the NBA, folks. \u201cThis,\u201d Durant said, \u201cis going to be an exciting season. Fun.\u201d The Warriors\u2019 five All-Stars (two of whom are former Kia MVPs) are still in their prime. And given that Andre Iguodala tends to transform from a fossil to an X-factor when spring arrives, perhaps only injury or another uncontrollable circumstance will keep the Warriors from making it an NBA-record five straight Western Conference crowns. \u201cIn terms of encouraging each other, being in tune with some of the things that might be thrown at you, whether it\u2019s injuries, whether it\u2019s a couple of slumps on the court, whatever the case is, we adapt really well and we don\u2019t stay down for too long,\u201d Curry said. * Warriors path from downtrodden to dynasty The Rockets, who won 65 games a season ago, are perhaps the most realistic challenger to the Warriors out West. But it\u2019s quite possible that Houston is weaker than it was in 2017-18. To understand how high the Warriors are sitting on the throne, you must survey what they\u2019ve left behind. Just look at how the biggest threats in the West have either hit dead ends or maxed themselves out trying to chase the Warriors since 2014. Memphis Grizzlies: At one point, they were considered the toughest matchup for the Warriors because they were polar opposite in style. Half-court and methodical, the Grizzlies took a switchblade to the basketball, slowing the tempo. And they exploited Golden State\u2019s lone weaknesses: Interior size and overall strength. They physically beat up the Warriors in the paint (Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol) and on the perimeter (Tony Allen). Additionally, Mike Conley was at times a handful at point guard at a time when Curry was winning MVP awards. But health and age wore the Grizzlies down and eventually forced them into a current reinvention that likely won\u2019t reap benefits until after the Warriors are finished. Oklahoma City Thunder:  As one of only two West teams (Houston being the other) to force the Warriors into a seventh game, OKC was prime for a takeover in 2016. That season, OKC eliminated a 67-win San Antonio Spurs team in the West semfinals. Durant and Russell Westbrook were healthy, humming and helping the Thunder to a 3-1 lead in the West finals. That, however, was their apex, and the costly collapse was heightened by the \u201cKlay Game\u201d ( 41 points in Game 6 ). Imagine, if not for a fateful turn of events \u2014 Klay\u2019s 3-point rampage, KD\u2019s second-half Game 7 vapor and the Warriors losing the 2016 Finals to Cleveland \u2014 maybe Durant sticks around in OKC. At any rate, the post-2016 West finals reconstruction being done by the Thunder (Exhibit A: The short-lived Carmelo Anthony experience) is falling short so far. Portland Trail Blazers:  They  were never seriously considered a thorn to the Warriors, and still aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just that they played themselves. They were fooled by the events in 2016, when they beat the injury-hampered Clippers in the first round. They were then somewhat competitive against the Warriors in the West semifinals (winning one game by 12, losing another in OT and the elimination game by just four). Flushed with false hope, that summer the Blazers handed out rich extensions to rotational players and, unfortunately, locked themselves into a team that hasn\u2019t won a playoff game since. San Antonio Spurs:  Like the Grizzlies, the Spurs caused trouble for the Warriors because of their disciplined style that put the brakes on the pace. San Antonio ruled the West just prior to the Warriors\u2019 run and the proud franchise wasn\u2019t willing to relinquish its hold so easily, causing the Warriors to shiver by winning the regular season matchup from 2014-16. Still, like Memphis, the Spurs turned gray almost overnight. Tim Duncan retired, Tony Parker lost some zip and then, of course, came the sneaky Zaza Pachulia foot plant that KO\u2019d Kawhi Leonard in the first game of their 2017 series . It hasn\u2019t been the same for the Spurs, who shipped off the disgruntled Leonard this summer. Houston Rockets:  While the Warriors were able to build around Curry to create a dynasty, the Rockets are in their third attempt to do likewise with James Harden. The Dwight Howard experiment was an exploding cigar, and then the strategy of turning Harden into a point guard failed to draw blood. Chris Paul arrived last season and the best record in the West followed, but Paul has always limped at the wrong time. True to form, his body failed him in the conference finals , just when the Rockets were up 3-2 on the Warriors and primed to issue a stunning statement. The conference-wide process of teams searching for the formula to bring an end to this \u201cGolden\u201d era has taken on an interesting twist. Except for the Rockets, who shuffled their deck slightly this summer, other West contenders are on a semi-defeatist two-year plan. As in: We\u2019re not ready now, but look out in a coupla years! LeBron James joined the Lakers this summer, but it\u2019s hard to take them seriously when LeBron himself says his new team isn\u2019t breathing the same air as the defending champs. His supporting cast is a mix of pups with no playoff experience and vets who\u2019ve seen better days. It\u2019s foolhardy to doubt the potential of any team with LeBron \u2014 eight straight trips to the championship round is no joke, even if it came through the East. But they\u2019ll stand a better chance next season, especially if they\u2019re bringing Kawhi or Jimmy Butler by then. * Why every team out West is trying to win in 2018-19 There\u2019s also the Utah Jazz, a Spurs-like operation led by a pair of Spurs alums in GM Dennis Lindsey and coach Quin Snyder. Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell is a star in the making, but you need more than one of those to match Golden State. Perhaps in time, Mitchell will get a shotgun rider, but Utah is a tough sell for A-list free agents. Houston stands out from the pack with Harden, Paul and center Clint Capela, who gave the Warriors fits last spring. They\u2019re still an attractive, turnkey team. Adding Anthony provides scoring, but does he impact a potential West finals rematch in 2019? With Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute gone, where is the perimeter defense coming from? Is it possible that Houston, with Paul aging, had its best chance last spring and didn\u2019t cash in? It\u2019s also possible the Warriors will do everyone in the West a favor and destroy themselves in the very near future. Durant can become a free agent next summer. Thompson\u2019s contract is up, too, although he\u2019s been very clear about his preference to stay even if that means making below market value. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is going to be really tough to replicate for anybody,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cYou have the proverbial window, however you want to put it. We have an incredible opportunity that\u2019s just not always going to be here. We want to take full advantage not only from a success standpoint but from an enjoyment standpoint. \u201cWe\u2019re well aware that it\u2019s not going to last forever.\u201d But that\u2019s getting ahead of the story here, which is whether the Warriors will fall shy of The Finals for the first time since 2014. A three-time champion is bringing everyone back and will add a bonus whenever the healing Cousins returns. Basketball can sometimes be a funny game and anything can happen to throw this scenario for a loop.

Butler had been absent for most of training camp and the preseason after he requested a trade from the team in September. Despite weeks of trade rumors and speculation, it appears Butler will begin the regular season on the Timberwolves. Butler spoke to the media after practice on Sunday. According to Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic, Butler was asked if he expects to be booed by the Timberwolves fans during the team\u2019s home opener on Friday. \u201cSure. Go ahead, boo me,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to change the way I play. That\u2019s going to make me smile more. So please, come on with it.\u201d Butler returned to the team last week for a contentious practice where he reportedly called out his coaches, teammates and the front office. After the practice, Butler spoke with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols to explain his actions. \u201cA lot of it is true. You have to think \u2026 I haven\u2019t played played basketball in so long,\u201d Butler told Nichols. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so passionate. And I love the game. And I don\u2019t do it for any other reason except to compete and go up against the best to try to prove that I can hang. So all of my emotion came out at one time. Was it the right way to do it? No. But I can\u2019t control that when I\u2019m out there competing. That\u2019s my love of the game. That\u2019s raw me. Me at my finest, my purest. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get inside the lines.\u201d \u201cI was honest,\u201d Butler continued. \u201cWas I brutally honest? Yes. But I think that\u2019s the problem. Everybody is so scared to be honest with one another. If you didn\u2019t like the way I handled myself in practice, one of the players come up to me. Somebody say something. Anybody. I\u2019m not going to take offense. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d The Timberwolves reportedly were close to trading Butler to the Miami Heat last week, but the talks reportedly broke down at the last minute. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the trade negotiations between the Timberwolves and Heat \u201chave been dead\u201d. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and two steals per game for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round. The Timberwolves will play the Spurs in San Antonio for their season opener on Wednesday ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). UPDATE: The Athletic\u2019s Jon Krawczynski reported later on Sunday that team owner Glen Taylor met personally with Butler, reaching an understanding that the Timberwolves will continue to seek a trade while Butler will give a professional effort.

Unable to find a trade, the Knicks waived the 33-year-old center Saturday with two years and $37.8 million remaining on his contract. Noah had been away from the team since clashing with former coach Jeff Hornacek last season, when he appeared in just seven games. The Knicks had already decided he wouldn\u2019t rejoin the club under new coach David Fizdale but were hoping they could find a long shot trade to get something back for him without having to cut him. The New York native signed with his hometown team in 2016 and drew a loud ovation in his first appearance at Madison Square Garden, where he was introduced as being from the Hell\u2019s Kitchen section of the city, rather than from Florida, the team he helped win two NCAA championships. The Chicago Bulls selected him with the ninth overall pick in the 2007 draft. He had great years with the Bulls, highlighted by being voted Defensive Player of the Year and first-team All-NBA in 2014. But Noah had begun battling injuries and already was in decline by the time former Knicks President Phil Jackson gave him a $72 million, four-year contract, and Noah could never regain his old form. His first season in New York ended early when he was suspended 20 games by the NBA in March 2017 for a failed drug test, a suspension that carried into the 2017-18 season. He was unable to regain his rotation spot once he was eligible to return and didn\u2019t play again following his argument with Hornacek after playing 4+ minutes in a loss at Golden State on Jan. 23. Noah finished with an average of 4.6 points and 7.9 rebounds with New York. His $18.6 million salary for this season will count fully against the salary cap and the Knicks can stretch out the remainder of his salary over multiple seasons. The Knicks also waived Kadeem Allen and Jeff Coby, getting their roster down to 17 players."},{"id":38163,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/old-school-power-rankings-2018-19-preseason","date":"2018-10-13","title":"Old School Power Rankings 2018-19: Preseason","content":" As the old cliche states: The more things change, the more they stay the same. He may have changed duds and locale, but LeBron James remains the King when it comes to our Old School Power Rankings. Can anyone snatch his throne or will we witness our first back-to-back OSPR champion? Since the last time we saw you, some big names have joined the 32-and-over club: George Hill, Goran Dragic, Al Horford, Rudy Gay and Wes Matthews. And Lou Williams will throw his hat onto the court later this month. Here\u2019s a quick look at all the OSPR champs: Pau Gasol ( 2015-16 ), Dwyane Wade ( 2016-17 ), LeBron James ( 2017-18 ). Also, we\u2019re trying something new this season. If you have something to say (clean version, please) about these rankings, send over an e-mail . If it\u2019s solid, we may include it in the next rankings. Just make sure to include your first name and city . 1. LeBron James (33), Los Angeles Lakers Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 1 Last season stats: 27.5 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 9.1 apg It\u2019s hard to fathom James slowing down now that he\u2019s in Hollywood. Heck, the bright lights might even mean another gear. We\u2019ll go out on a fat limb and say someone will have to have an extra special season to overthrow him. And if the preseason is any indication (I know, I know), James is ready \u2014 averaging 13.8 points in 15.8 minutes on 60 percent shooting from the field. 2. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 4 Last season stats: 18.6 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 7.9 apg How will Paul\u2019s numbers carry over this season with the addition of volume-shooter Carmelo Anthony? Dare we say he goes for less than 16 points for the first time since 2010-11? The other big question that seems to follow Paul every season is whether he can stay healthy. The gritty All-Star point guard has failed to play 70 games in each of the past two seasons. 3. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 2 Last season stats: 23.1 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 2.0 apg Tony Parker is gone. Manu Ginobili retired. Lonnie Walker IV, Dejounte Murray and Derrick White are injured. So \u2026 Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan will be doing some heavy lifting at the start of the season. And based on what the big man did last season (averaging more than 23 points for the first time since \u201914-15), he\u2019ll be up for the challenge. 4. Marc Gasol (33), Memphis Grizzlies Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 6 Last season stats: 17.2 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 4.2 apg After averaging 19.5 points two seasons ago, Gasol took a couple big steps back, slipping to 17.2. One huge reason for that was the absence of stud point guard Mike Conley, who missed all but 12 games last season. A healthy Conley should mean an energized and engaged Gasol, and a likely return to 19 points per game.  5. Dwight Howard (32), Washington Wizards Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 3 Last season stats: 16.6 ppg, 12.5 rpg, 1.3 apg Howard hasn\u2019t played in any preseason games, dealing with a piriformis injury that may or may not linger into the start of the regular season. That said, Howard proved to be reliable last season, playing in 81 games while averaging more than 12 rebounds for a second straight season. With Bradley Beal and John Wall around, Howard\u2019s scoring will likely slip from last year\u2019s 16.6. 6. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Ranking at end of \u201917-18: NA Last season stats: 12.9 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 4.7 apg Horford\u2019s scoring has gone down in each of the last three seasons (15.2 in \u201915-16, 14.0 in \u201916-17 and 12.9 last season), and that should continue to be the case as both Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward enter the season healthy. As long as Boston\u2019s talented unit stays healthy, we\u2019re likely looking at 11 and seven from Horford this season. 7. Paul Millsap (33), Denver Nuggets Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 7 Last season stats: 14.6 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.8 apg Millsap\u2019s first season in Denver didn\u2019t go according to plan, as he missed 44 games with a wrist injury. With the wealth of young talent surrounding him, Millsap may not average more than 14 this season. But he should be able to chip in solid production on the boards, some steals and blocks and knock down a fair share of 3-pointers.  8. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Ranking at end of \u201917-18: Just missed Last season stats: 16.2 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 6.9 apg With his longtime buddy DeMar DeRozan shipped out to San Antonio, will Lowry quickly find chemistry with new stud Kawhi Leonard? Whether or not that happens will have a huge impact on the Raptors\u2019 season \u2014 and Lowry\u2019s stats. After averaging 21 or more points in the previous two seasons, Lowry slipped to 16.2 last year. We expect that to ascend to about 18 per game. 9. Goran Dragic (32), Miami Heat Ranking at end of \u201917-18: NA Last season stats: 17.3 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.8 apg It\u2019s hard to believe Dragic is on this list, considering he still looks like a baby-faced 25-year-old. But aging hasn\u2019t slowed the Slovenian guard, who has averaged better than 17 points in each of the last two seasons. Judging by four preseason games in which he averaged 12.3 points and 46.2 FG% in 20.6 minutes, he\u2019s ready to roll. 10. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Ranking at end of \u201917-18: 5 Last season stats: 17.1 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 3.0 apg Talking about preseason games, Redick has been dialed in, averaging 15.8 points, 58.8 FG% and 56.5 3PT% in 21 minutes. With the 76ers\u2019 abundance of young talent ready to take another step, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Redick can repeat his offensive surge from last year in which he averaged a career-best 17.1. Just missed the cut: Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Rajon Rondo, Trevor Ariza, Pau Gasol, Rudy Gay Will turn 32 this season:  Lou Williams (Oct. 27), Ian Mahinmi (Nov. 5) * * * The views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting."},{"id":38164,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/butler-collateral-damage-mounting-timberwolves","date":"2018-10-13","title":"Collateral damage from Butler fiasco mounting in Minnesota","content":"MILWAUKEE \u2013 As the Minnesota Timberwolves\/Jimmy Butler Reality TV Hostage Tour ground through Day 19 Friday, the collateral damage mounted. Butler and the Wolves once again were in different cities \u2013 the team was getting drubbed in its final preseason game on the road against the Bucks while its malcontent All-Star and (*cough*) leader was back in the Twin Cities working on his conditioning, according to coach Tom Thibodeau. No national TV crew coincidentally happened to be there with him to confirm that claim, though, so media and fans had to take the coach\u2019s word for it. Still, considering what transpired the previous two days when they all were in the same city, out of sight, out of mind wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad strategy. Butler by all accounts had commandeered practice on Wednesday , arriving late, exiting early, punking teammates and cursing his bosses in between. On Thursday, he did (or maybe didn\u2019t, depending on which Twitter account you believed) convene a players-only meeting after Thibodeau canceled a scheduled workout. What is increasingly clear is that Butler\u2019s antics and posturing initially intended solely to serve and impact him was having some unpleasant ripple effects on a team that\u2019s about as poorly prepared as any in the league for the start of the regular season next week. The longer it drags on, the more this is certain: No one is going to get out of this untouched. When you\u2019re sitting near a food fight, you\u2019re inevitably going to get splattered. Here, in no particular order, are people and things that have taken hits thanks to Butler\u2019s craving for attention, his bizarro approach to leadership and his ill-advised way of fulfilling a contract: Karl-Anthony Towns. Towns has been Butler\u2019s heavy bag before and during this regrettable episode, in the past with criticism of his defense and most recently in remarks by Butler about the big fellow\u2019s work habits and candor. The 22-year-old \u2013 who may just be targeted by Butler out of jealousy over the five-year, $190 million contract extension Towns signed last month \u2013 has tried to stay out of the fray, only to be yanked in by Butler\u2019s comments to ESPN on Wednesday. Normally an affable, enthusiastic interviewee, Towns went Stepford guy at Friday\u2019s shootaround, repeating a couple of answers regardless of the questions. Finally, asked if he was tired of the same Butler-driven topics, a glum, dead-eyed Towns said, \u201cAre you tired of hearing me say \u2018We\u2019re playing basketball today here in Milwaukee?\u2019\u201d He didn\u2019t smile. Tom Thibodeau. Thibodeau isn\u2019t blameless in this, but there\u2019s been a piling-on from Minnesota and national media that simply isn\u2019t fair. He did not invite or anticipate Butler\u2019s unprofessional reaction to the Wolves\u2019 grown-up business decision not to dismantle their roster to pay him bigger, sooner, rather than later. Thibodeau arrived with a mandate to end a 13-year playoff drought and did just that after properly identifying Butler as a star through determination and sweat, a veteran who could help the Wolves at both ends of the court and in their locker room. Thibodeau vouched for Butler to his team owner, Glen Taylor, and to the other players when he acquired the 6-foot-8 swingman from Chicago. He rightfully didn\u2019t throw other helpful players overboard to tear up Butler\u2019s contract this summer, instead offering \u201conly\u201d a four-year, $110 million extension available without shedding some of his teammates. We all should have the opportunity to go haywire over such an offer. Now Thibodeau\u2019s great sin is staying loyal both to Butler (given their history with the Bulls) and to the plan that brought the coach to Minnesota. It might wind up costing him his coaching job, his role as Wolves\u2019 chief basketball officer or both. Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague and Anthony Tolliver. And any other Wolves player who bought into or signed onto the idea that this was a team on the rise, with key pieces in place for a sustained run of high-seed playoff appearances. Timberwolves fans. These folks, who either show up diligently at Target Center or keep their powder dry for when they can buy tickets to see a real contender, can\u2019t seem to catch a break. It\u2019s been one bout of dysfunction after another, their team and, by association, themselves cast as laughingstocks in flyover NBA land. Truth. For a guy who talks a lot about being honest and valuing that in others, Butler sure has been mendacious. He says he wants to win, then designates mediocre or worse franchises as preferred trade destinations. He claims to be a leader, yet can\u2019t cope with Towns or Wiggins and their allegedly oh-so-frustrating natures. Oh, and ESPN just happened to be in the hinterlands \u2013 lights, camera, action! \u2013 the day Butler hijacks practice. Right. These theatrics are about money and attention. And maybe a little spite. Spine. If Thibodeau and Taylor are serious about doing what\u2019s right for their team \u2013 rather than what pleases Miami\u2019s Pat Riley, no matter how profane he allegedly gets \u2013 they should be looking seriously at the options they have for enforcing their deal with Butler. A fine, a suspension and maybe even a breach-of-contract showdown should be on the table, given his conduct already detrimental to the team. But there is no sense the Wolves are ready to play hardball, or even contemplating it. It\u2019s disquieting, too, that none of Butler\u2019s teammates has called him on his selfishness. When Kevin Garnett dominated Wolves practices with his game and his mouth, it was fuel and energy for the future Hall of Famer and his teammates. When Butler did that this week, it was all about Jimmy. Andrew Wiggins. Wait, scratch that. Wiggins can\u2019t be collateral damage. He\u2019s Teflon, or rather, Kevlar, as far as anything touching or rattling him from his eerily unmoved, unmotivated, unaffected centeredness. He wasn\u2019t in Milwaukee Friday either, keeping vigil for the birth of his first child. With that, his dog, his video-game console and his five-year, $147 million contract, life is good with or without Butler. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Teague went as far as to call talk of the meeting \u201cfake news\u201d: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Luke1luk\/status\/1050469052945195009 The Wolves visit the Bucks tonight ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) and held shootaround this morning in Milwaukee. The topic of Butler, however, was one Wolves players and coach Tom Thibodeau spoke sparingly on. Thibodeau told reporters Butler is in Minneapolis \u201c working on conditioning \u201d and that the \u201csituation remains fluid\u201d regarding the guard. Regarding talk of the players-only meeting yesterday and other reports earlier this week, Thibodeau said : \u201cI\u2019m not answering to all the stuff that gets put out there that is garbage.\u201d Wolves center Karl-Anthony Towns, when asked about Butler during Friday\u2019s shootaround, would only respond with : \u201cI\u2019m excited for tonight\u2019s game in Milwaukee.\u201d Towns was willing to discuss other topics, but did not engage about questions regarding Butler\u2019s future. Butler spoke with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols on Wednesday afternoon to explain his actions during practice. \u201cA lot of it is true. You have to think \u2026 I haven\u2019t played played basketball in so long,\u201d Butler told Nichols. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so passionate. And I love the game. And I don\u2019t do it for any other reason except to compete and go up against the best to try to prove that I can hang. So all of my emotion came out at one time. Was it the right way to do it? No. But I can\u2019t control that when I\u2019m out there competing. That\u2019s my love of the game. That\u2019s raw me. Me at my finest, my purest. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get inside the lines.\u201d \u201cI was honest,\u201d Butler continued. \u201cWas I brutally honest? Yes. But I think that\u2019s the problem. Everybody is so scared to be honest with one another. If you didn\u2019t like the way I handled myself in practice, one of the players come up to me. Somebody say something. Anybody. I\u2019m not going to take offense. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d Days ago, multiple news outlets reported that a trade between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Miami Heat for Jimmy Butler had fallen apart . However, that apparently hasn\u2019t kept the Heat from showing interest in rekindling trade talks with the Wolves for their disgruntled All-Star guard. Wojnarowski reports that the Heat remain interested in restarting trade talks with the Wolves after the deal that seemed close to happening collapsed on Saturday . Yesterday, Butler reportedly informed Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau that he still wants to be traded , per The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania and Krawczynski. Butler had been away from the team while the Wolves were in California for a preseason bonding trip . Proposed changes from Minnesota created a breakdown in earlier trade negotiations just as the teams were close to finalizing a deal. The teams reportedly advanced to the point of exchanging player medical information, which is typically the last step of NBA trade negotiations. Except for this trade, the Timberwolves responded with an amendment to the framework of the deal, according to Wojnarowski , which caused the trade talks to \u201cfracture\u201d. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and two steals per game for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. Still, it seems the Heat are perhaps the only serious contender for Butler at this point, writes Wojnarowski: Reports circulated in the offseason that Butler was frustrated with the nonchalant attitudes of Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Next season, Wiggins will begin playing on his maximum contract in 2018-19. Towns signed an extension with the Wolves shortly after training camp opened . The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round.

The team said a timeline for his return will be determined at a later date. \u200bWhite was set to be the Spurs\u2019 likely starting point guard after guard Dejounte Murray suffered a torn ACL in Sunday\u2019s preseason loss to the Houston Rockets.

From the league-wide reshaping of traditional team strategies to the visual look of the game \u2014 think updated uniforms and new, relaxed rules on in-game sneakers \u2014 the NBA is taking on a new feel for a new era.  The way the game is officiated is shifting, too. Under the latest modifications , the NBA is instituting three revised rules. First, the shot clock will now reset to 14 seconds on offensive rebounds instead of 24 seconds. In addition, the definition of a clear path foul has been simplified to reduce judgment calls by officials. Lastly, referees will have an expanded ability to review \u201chostile acts\u201d by players and coaches. New rules won\u2019t be all that NBA officials welcome this season as there will be a new referee joining the team.

The emphasis on freedom of movement is geared toward cutting down on arm wraps, grabbing and dislodging by both offensive and defensive players. The respect for the game guidelines have further identified gestures and reactions by both players and coaches that go against proper game decorum. Air punches and overt yelling will result in a technical foul. Controlled, heat-of-the-moment reactions that aren\u2019t demonstrative will be accepted.

The greatest playmaker of all time and the greatest playmaker of his era (who is also, perhaps, the greatest all-around player of all time). The pairing of executive, entrepreneur and mogul Magic Johnson with the next generation version of himself in LeBron James is a match made in basketball and Hollywood heaven. Having these stars align \u2014 two of the biggest names in the history of the sport on the biggest stage, together \u2014 is a game-changer that needs an original script. Their partnership, for at least the next three years with a player option for a fourth, sent a jolt through the basketball world this summer and has served to energize a hungry Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 fan base that is starving for a return to relevance. If this takes and the Lakers\u2019 past and present mesh the way some think it can, the Lakers\u2019 future is as bright as it\u2019s been since Kobe Bryant\u2019s title-winning zenith at the end of the past decade. * Smith:  Unique challenges ahead for James These LeBron-led Lakers are not operating with the same championship-or-bust expectations Bryant\u2019s teams did before injuries sacked him late in his career. The Golden State Warriors\u2019 dynasty didn\u2019t exist then, when Kobe\u2019s Lakers were one of several powerhouse Western Conference teams taking turns representing the conference in The Finals. Making the playoffs for these current Lakers will be a net positive, no matter how oversized the expectations might be elsewhere. (The Vegas vibe that they are title favorites is more than a bit premature given that they have missed the playoff five straight years, which equals the total from the franchise\u2019s first 65 seasons.) Both Johnson and James have been extremely shrewd in sidestepping any specific expectations for a team built on the fly after LeBron\u2019s decision to head west. Magic\u2019s first public words after LeBron made his decision cautioned against an overnight turnaround. \u201c I think the one thing that we have to, and the fans have to, be patient about is the chemistry on the court, because we \u2019 re putting together basically all these guys will be new to each other, right? \u201d  Johnson said on a conference call. \u201c It \u2019 s probably going to take us at least a month or two, probably closer to two months, to really understand how to play with each other and how to read each other, all those things. \u201c We saw that LeBron and Miami struggled for the first two months, and then they finally got it together and they were a championship-caliber team. I \u2019 m sure when he went back to Cleveland in (2014), they struggled until they got to know each other and then they were a championship-caliber team. And it will be no different here. We \u2019 ll struggle to understand how to play with each other, how everybody likes the ball and those types of things, but eventually we \u2019 ll get it together and I feel we \u2019 ll be one of the best teams in the West. \u201d Whether the Lakers\u2019 roster mix is here to preserve the long-term plan of chasing more stars next summer or simply adequate cover for a franchise that boasts tantalizing-yet-unproven young talent and a curious mix of veterans is anyone\u2019s guess. But the push back then, and even more so now, makes perfect sense. An offseason, training camp and a few preseason games is hardly enough time to get comfortable with one another. And while youngsters Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart are talented, each remains very much a work in progress. That said, if things go remarkably well and Lakers coach Luke Walton can find a way to make these seemingly mismatched pieces fit, the Lakers could shock the system in the West. The true power in the West stretches in a straight line from Oakland to Houston. Everything outside of the Warriors and Rockets is up for grabs. But the Warriors understand the power of LeBron better than any other team in the league outside of Cleveland and Miami, having faced off against his Cavaliers in each of the past four Finals . Thoughts of LeBron and the Cavs rallying from a 3-1 Finals deficit in 2016  still stings in Oakland, as it is the lone blemish in Golden State\u2019s dynasty. \u201cWell, the times we\u2019ve seen him he\u2019s always been at the top of the East during The Finals,\u201d Warriors forward Klay Thompson told reporters before Wednesday\u2019s game in Las Vegas. \u201cAnd those games are always intense. I expect him to greatly improve the Lakers and they\u2019ve obviously got a bunch of guys who are proven now. So I just expect it to be intense. \u201cAny time you play against arguably the best player in the world, no matter what sport, you want to measure yourself against him so you play as hard as you can. That\u2019s why guys like Steph [Curry ], KD [ Kevin Durant ], Kobe, LeBron, James Harden , any [top] guys face their opponent\u2019s best game every night, so it will be no different when we play the Lakers. \u201d But what if things don\u2019 t go as planned? As easy as it is to just assume that LeBron\u2019 s influence will elevate the Lakers the same way it has every other team he \u2019 s been on, this bunch is a different monster. LeBron joined forces with two other All-Stars in his previous moves: Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in Cleveland. He\u2019 ll have no such support with the Lakers. Magic and LeBron have both heaped praise upon veteran additions Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley, citing their high basketball IQs and elite-level competitiveness as qualities that were critical for the culture change the Lakers seek. The optics say otherwise, as each of them is on a one-year contract that equates to a trial run that can be quickly abandoned if the chemistry goes awry. And none of them provide the outside shooting and floor spacing  that has worked so well surrounding LeBron in the past. All of them come with high-risk levels, given their collective histories as peculiar fits elsewhere. \u201cWe have no concerns, \u201d  Magic said of the Lakers \u2019  eclectic bunch of signees. \u201c And we love that they are all different individuals and bring something different to the table. We needed some toughness. We needed some grittiness. We needed somebody to come and be upset that somebody had a defense lapse. \u201cWe love everything that everybody brings to the table. And we \u2019 ve been seeing it out here every single day. So some guys had different things happen in their past. So what. Rondo is still a champion. And you saw what he did for New Orleans last season. So we \u2019 re happy to have him. We don \u2019 t care about what happened in your past. We only care about what happens when you put on that purple and gold. They know what they need to do and how to act as a professional. And we don \u2019 t want nobody to change. \u201cI want Lance to shake it up because that \u2019 s who he is. Michael Beasley come on, do your thing. But we \u2019 re not concerned. If I was concerned we wouldn\u2019t have signed none of them. I \u2019 m excited to have them, each and every one of them, trust me. \u201d Magic, as he often has over the years, and with good reason, is trusting his own instincts. He\u2019 s betting on himself. He \u2019 s betting on the Lakers \u2019  brand, and what that \u2019s meant to the league for decades. He\u2019 s relying on the studying, and last season \u2019 s playoffs in particular, that he and general manager Rob Pelinka did before they fleshed out the roster. But most of all he\u2019 s betting on LeBron, the player he loves to refer to as \u201c the greatest player in the world, \u201d  and the change he can bring on and off the court. He\u2019 s betting on their shared vision of what the Lakers can be, a vision that was crystallized in their conversation in the opening stages of free agency in the only formal meeting LeBron took with any executive from a team wishing to pursue him. They are convinced. They believe all of the ingredients are there. The only thing needed now is a classic Hollywood ending. * * * > More from Shiny & New Week Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He was 24, entering the physical prime of his eventual Hall of Fame career while also poised to chase championships for perhaps the most glamorous NBA franchise at that time. Shaq was following in the footsteps of the giants, literally, that came before him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 28 when he first pulled a Lakers jersey over his head, arriving via trade from the Milwaukee Bucks . The Lakers luring a big star to the NBA\u2019s brightest and most electric media market is nothing new. Said star showing up at the ripe old age of 33 (as LeBron James did this summer ) is a different type of Hollywood story. His decision to tackle this challenge 16 seasons into his career comes with a physical risk that his past free-agent moves (from Cleveland to Miami in 2010 and back to Cleveland in 2014 ) did not. Does he have enough left in his tank to lead the Lakers to the sort of heights he did the Heat and Cavaliers? * Smith:  Who might Lakers add in the future? James \u2019 early energy \u2014 albeit in brief glimpses \u2014 has been off the charts. The player who dominated the Eastern Conference for so long, leading his teams to eight straight trips to The Finals in the process, seems to be the same one who showed up in Los Angeles. He\u2019s still a physical marvel, remaining the best and, according to the NBA.com GM survey , most difficult player in the league to deal with. In that respect, LeBron\u2019s situation with the Lakers is more akin to Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s than Shaq\u2019s or Kareem\u2019s. Chamberlain was headed into the twilight of his career when the Lakers acquired him in a trade with Philadelphia for Jerry Chambers, Archie Clark and Darrall Imhoff in July of 1968. He was 32 and no longer the behemoth capable of averaging 50 points and 25 rebounds in a season, which he did at 25 in his third season . Chamberlain was still a force, averaging 20.5 points and 21.1 rebounds per game in his first season in purple and gold. But he was the missing piece on a roster already boasting future Hall of Famers Jerry West, Gail Goodrich and Elgin Baylor. Chamberlain was Finals MVP for the Lakers\u2019 1972 title team and finished his career a year later at 36. LeBron joined a team devoid of the superstar talent that he brings to the Lakers. But he\u2019s traveled this path before, taking a reconfigured team from the lottery to The Finals in 2014-15, his first season back in Cleveland . He\u2019s built for the transition in ways that no other player in the league is or could be, given the trail he\u2019s blazed in free agency during his career. \u201cIt always feels different for me any time you change uniforms,\u201d James told reporters after his Lakers\u2019 debut in a preseason game in San Diego. \u201cIt felt different when I changed from a Vincent-St. Mary jersey to a Cavs jersey, from a Cavs jersey to a Heat jersey back to a Cavs jersey, and now being a Laker, so \u2026 it definitely feels different and it\u2019ll take a little bit of time getting used to.\u201d * * * > More from Shiny & New Week Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

But if you thought bagging the league\u2019s biggest star in the summer of 2018 was all the Lakers\u2019 brass had in mind, you clearly have not been paying attention. Lakers President Magic Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka aren\u2019t done reshaping the league\u2019s most iconic franchise. LeBron was the first splash in what could be a tidal wave next summer , when the Lakers will be flush with enough cap space ($35.7 million) to chase another superstar \u2026 or maybe even two. * Smith:  LeBron brings new \u2018Lake Show\u2019 to L.A. Think Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and\/or others. If you\u2019ve already reeled in the biggest star in the game, no one is off limits. And the Lakers aren\u2019t limited to the free-agent market. With the way they\u2019ve positioned themselves \u2014 youngsters still on rookie deals and a cast of veterans not named LeBron on franchise-friendly one-year contracts \u2014 they could just as easily mine the trade market in February. That might require the Lakers to part ways with one of their prized young players (Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma or Lonzo Ball) before they reach anything close to their potential. But that\u2019s a risk that might have to be taken to elevate the Lakers to championship contention during the four-year window LeBron is working with right now. So, who could join LeBron in purple and gold for the start of the 2019-20 season? One or more of the aforementioned stars and\/or possibly even someone else who isn\u2019t currently on the radar. But let\u2019s start with the summer of 2019\u2019s Big Four: \u2022 Kawhi Leonard\u2019s  desire to return to his Southern California roots were postponed when San Antonio traded him to Toronto in a multi-player deal that sent DeMar DeRozan to the Spurs. But everyone knows the Raptors are on the clock. If they cannot forge the kind of bond with Leonard that the Oklahoma City Thunder did last season with Paul George, Leonard could be on the move. The LA Clippers could also satisfy Leonard\u2019s need for a SoCal home base. But the Clippers don\u2019t have LeBron on their roster to help woo one of the league\u2019s best two-way players. With the Warriors and Rockets at the top of heap in the Western Conference and the league, you must fight star power with star power of your own. \u2022 Jimmy Butler is making so much noise , there\u2019s no telling where he ends up playing this season. His trade request from the Timberwolves came before training camp started, giving the Lakers (and other interested teams) oodles of time to evaluate the situation and digest what adding a combustible star of Butler \u2019 s ilk might bring. What isn\u2019t in question is Butler\u2019s talent and the fact that he\u2019s the sort of elite, two-way perimeter star that would flourish alongside LeBron. The Lakers could wait and chase Butler next summer instead of giving up assets they\u2019d prefer to hold on to. But Butler is the one player in this group who is virtually guaranteed to be on the move. \u2022 K lay Thompson has the deepest Lakers ties of any player in the league. He grew up in a Lakers\u2019 household, with his father Mychal winning a pair of championships with the Showtime Lakers. Thompson, of course, has repeatedly stated that he wants to stay with the Warriors  \u2026  and the Warriors won\u2019t want to let one of their franchise pillars leave \u2014 especially to join the Lakers. But that\u2019s exactly why Thompson makes so much sense for the Lakers. A catch-and-shoot wizard and standout defender, Thompson would be an ideal complement to LeBron, the Lakers\u2019 best playmaker since Magic. (Sorry, Steve Nash.) This is a homecoming the Lakers would relish, both for what it does for them and what it would take away from the Warriors. \u2022 Kevin Durant is the nuclear option. If Johnson and Pelinka (with a huge recruiting boost by LeBron, of course) got Durant to relocate to SoCal for a superstar pairing the NBA hasn \u2019 t seen since the Shaq-Kobe years, it would turn the basketball world upside down. Since arriving in Oakland as a free agent in 2016, Durant has only signed one-year deals with a player option. James and Durant have worked out together over the years and have a friendship as healthy as their professional rivalry. Joining forces would enrage fans everywhere outside of Los Angeles, and no doubt make them both targets of former players who have complained about the lack of competitiveness among the today \u2019 s NBA superstars. Whatever transpires between now, the February trade deadline and next summer \u2019 s free-agent period, the Lakers are ready to pounce. * * * > More from Shiny & New Week Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The clinic is part of the new \u201cHer Time To Play\u201d initiative that was announced on Monday to tip off Jr. NBA Week. The NBA and WNBA created Her Time To Play to inspire the next generation of girls to learn and play the game in a positive and healthy way while learning important life skills such as teamwork, leadership and self-confidence. Participation in sports positively impacts the health and wellbeing of youth, but twice as many girls as boys quit sports by the age of 14, according to the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation. \u201cI think that\u2019s very positive and very healthy for girls to play sports because there\u2019s a lot of life lessons they can learn through that,\u201d Hayward told USA Today\u2019s For The Win . \u201cI think it\u2019s very important.\u201d For Hayward \u2013 who serves as an ambassador for Her Time To Play and has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s empowerment through the #LeanInTogether campaign \u2013 this issue hits close to home as a father of two young daughters with a third little girl on the way. It was a similar feeling for Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who has two young daughters and a newborn son. This August, Curry hosted the \u201cIt\u2019s Our Game\u201d basketball camp in Walnut Creek, Calif. \u2013 a free event for select Bay Area girls. The Warriors-run two-day camp not only had plenty of oncourt drills and fun, but also advice from the two-time NBA MVP as well as a panel of notable women in sports. \u201cWe want to be able to instill the confidence in girls that they can be a part of the game as well and do special things with the game,\u201d Curry told Warriors.com . Her Time To Play will provide hundreds of youth organizations with a free curriculum consisting of oncourt basketball training and life-skills lessons developed specifically for young women to prepare them for the challenges of adolescence. The curriculum includes a dozen lessons on topics including: healthy eating and nutrition, teamwork, self-confidence, mental wellness, body image and bullying. Each chapter features a WNBA team and highlights personal life stories shared by WNBA players, including All-Stars Elena Delle Donne and Nneka Ogwumike. The voice teaching those lessons is also at the heart of Her Time To Play. It is important for young girls to have female mentors in sports, but only 28 percent of youth sports coaches are women, according to The Aspen Institute. As such, Her Time To Play also aims to increase the number of women in coaching and youth sports. The Jr. NBA will provide opportunities for more than 500 new coaches to receive their USAB Coach License, and select coaches will be honored at the 2019 Jr. NBA Youth Basketball Leadership Conference for their commitment to growing the game.  \u201cRepresentation matters,\u201d said Dallas Wings guard and Her Time To Play ambassador Skylar Diggins-Smith. \u201cHer Time To Play is an important step towards ensuring that young women have access to mentors and others invested in helping them achieve success.\u201d Her Time To Play is another step in the NBA\u2019s wholistic approach to making youth sports more fun and inclusive for both girls and boys, and using the game to teach important values and life lessons. During Jr. NBA Coaches Forums, held in cities across the country, the Jr. NBA emphasizes respect and inclusion among kids of all ages through training sessions with youth coaches in partnership with A Call To Men and Athlete Ally. This season\u2019s forums will continue to equip coaches with key learnings and resources related to diversity, gender and LGBTQ inclusion and gender violence. Jr. NBA Week and Saturday\u2019s camp in Boston are important steps in a leaguewide effort to even the landscape of youth sports and remind girls everywhere that it is always Her Time To Play."},{"id":38242,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-uniforms-2018-19-season","date":"2018-10-11","title":"Lakers, Grizzlies, Nuggets boast new duds for 2018-19","content":" The Denver Nuggets, Memphis Grizzlies, Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Lakers, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic and Utah Jazz all had varying degrees of success in 2017-18. One thing they all had in common over the summer, though, was a reworking of some (if not all) of their on-court looks for 2018-19. To one degree or another, each of the teams unveiled new uniforms for the upcoming season. The Grizzlies and Nuggets also updated their logos and court designs for next season, but the Grizzlies\u2019 logo still features the traditional stoic Grizzly bear face . The Nuggets say their new logos and uniforms \u201care a nod to the Nuggets\u2019 past\u201d as they approach the new season. As for the Lakers, their uniforms have brought back elements of the team\u2019s \u201cShowtime\u201d era from the 1980s \u2014 a time in which Los Angeles won five NBA titles and made eight NBA Finals appearances. The Jazz, Hornets, Magic, Hawks and Wolves went through tweaks to their roster lineup, adding in new-look Classic Edition uniforms. Here\u2019s a closer look at each team\u2019s new look and more \u2026 The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 makeover isn\u2019t being limited to just the names on the roster for next season . After signing free-agent forward LeBron James this summer as well as a host of other household names, the Lakers have changed up their uniform look for 2018-19, too. According to the team, the new uniforms for next season \u201c bring back an element of the 1980s Showtime Era \u2014 updated numbers, which use a vertical drop shadow \u2014 along with a rounded neckline. The font effect references the Lakers\u2019 storied past, while also positioning a fresh direction for the franchise.\u201d The Lakers were one of the busiest teams in free agency this summer, adding James as well as fellow veteran players JaVale McGee, Michael Beasley, Rajon Rondo and Lance Stephenson. That group \u2014 coupled with youngsters Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball \u2014 are expected to help Los Angeles take a big step forward in the Western Conference this season.    Redesigned jerseys and branding will mark the beginning of a new era for a Memphis team hoping to recapture its usual place in the NBA playoffs. The city\u2019s famous Beale Street was the inspiration for much of the team\u2019s new image, per Grizzlies.com . \u201cThe evolved wordmark and numbering system,\u201d the site explains, \u201crepresent a more progressive and modernized take on its predecessor, while maintaining and deepening the connection to the Beale Street neon-inspired inline.\u201d Joining mainstay stars Marc Gasol and Mike Conley in the effort to restore the Grizzlies\u2019 postseason aspirations is fourth overall pick Jaren Jackson Jr., who shined in NBA Summer League . Aside from the new uniforms, the Grizzlies also made updates to their home court for 2018-19 as well.    The Denver Nuggets are celebrating their 50th season in the NBA and doing so with a new look that both looks ahead to the future and embraces the team\u2019s past. On June 6, the Nuggets unveiled new uniforms and new logos while also mentioning that their home court at Pepsi Center would get a new look for 2018-19, too. \u201cThe key word that we\u2019ve chosen around this event is \u2018Evolve,\u2019\u201d Nuggets president Josh Kroenke said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing as a franchise. I think we\u2019re evolving into something new and something exciting. I think our younger players in particular, this is something they can build and call their own, this type of identity.\u201d All of the uniforms have been made over, with the baby blue that has marked the team gone from the team\u2019s color scheme. Their blue third uniform \u2014 honoring the Mile High City \u2014 is reflective of that, while burgundy has been added to the overall color palette in uniforms and logos for next season .     The Orlando Magic were granted their expansion franchise on April 22, 1987. Since then, the Magic have won five division titles, made 14 playoff appearances, two NBA Finals and watched as players such as Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady and Dwight Howard enjoyed some of their best seasons in Orlando\u2019s blue and white uniforms. As the team enters its 30th season of existence in 2018-19, the Magic are throwing back to that era with a new Classic Edition jersey. From 1994-98, the Magic turned heads around the league with their blue pinstriped uniforms as O\u2019Neal and Hardaway took the franchise to its first Finals in 1995.  These throwback jerseys utilize nearly the same design as the pinstriped blue jersey the team used as a road jersey from 1994-98. However, there are some modern, subtle changes to them. The \u201cOrlando\u201d script on the front of the jersey features a silver star in place of the \u201ca\u201d, there are Disney and Nike logos on the jersey and the word \u201cMagic\u201d is splashed across the front waistband. The Magic will wear these Classic Edition uniforms for select games in the coming season.  Much like the Orlando Magic, the Minnesota Timberwolves entered the NBA on April 22, 1987. Although they didn\u2019t officially play a game until the 1989-90 season, the Wolves are celebrating their 30th year of existence by busting out a uniform from the team\u2019s glory days of the late 1990s and early-to-mid 2000s. Memories of Kevin Garnett, Stephon Marbury, Latrell Sprewell, Wally Szczerbiak, Sam Cassell and others are sure to return when Minnesota dons its Classic Edition jerseys in 2018-19. The look, per the team, is the Timberwolves\u2019 longest-tenured uniform and highlights what the team wore from 1996-2008. During that stretch, the Wolves made eight straight playoff berths and reached the Western Conference finals in 2004. The uniform is complete with black as its primary color, proudly showcases the team\u2019s name across the chest, and is complemented by sets of green trees which are symbolic to the Minnesota environment. * * *  A look at the NBA history books shows that the Atlanta Hawks are one of the longest-tenured teams in league history . With the 2018-19 season approaching, the Hawks are closing in on their 50th season in Atlanta since moving there from St. Louis. As such, they will have a new Hardwood Classics uniform to sport once this new season begins. Per the team, the Hawks will wear the first jersey they wore in Atlanta this season \u2014 a powder blue and red-trimmed uniform that was worn most famously by Lou Hudson for just one season in 1968. Aside from these uniforms, the Hawks also have two new home-court floor designs they\u2019ll debut in \u201918-19. * * *  It was 30 years ago come the start of the 2018-19 season that the Charlotte Hornets burst onto the scene in North Carolina. As a new season awaits, the team is celebrating that debut of the franchise with a new white Classic Edition uniform to be worn during the 2018-19 season. Like the teal version from last season, this new uniform throws back to the original Hornets style the team wore from 1988-97. When the team sports the uniforms, it will be during the Hornets\u2019 series of \u201cClassic Night\u201d games \u2014 ones in which the team will honor franchise greats and feature giveaways of bobbleheads and T-shirts commemorating some top players and moments in team history. \u201cWith the success of our teal Classic Edition uniforms last season, we felt it was only right to bring the white version back this year as part of our 30th Anniversary celebration,\u201d said Hornets President & Vice Chairman Fred Whitfield said in a statement. \u201cAs we look to replicate the experience and excitement of the early days of the Hornets, wearing the white uniform that the original team wore every night at the Charlotte Coliseum brings another layer of authenticity for our fans.\u201d As part of this celebration of the Hornets\u2019 past, Charlotte will bust out a throwback home-court design to honor their anniversary season.  Since the 1979-80 season, the Jazz have called Salt Lake City home. The team moved to Utah after spending its first five seasons of existence in New Orleans and, after doing so, became one of the more stable NBA franchises ever since. In celebration of their 40th season as the Utah Jazz, the team will pay homage to one of the great eras of success the team enjoyed \u2014 the mid-1980s and early 1990s \u2014 by sporting uniforms from that era in 2018-19 . The Classic Edition uniforms feature the original Utah Jazz logo in gold and white on the front chest of the jersey, and the original J-Note logo is placed on the front left leg of the shorts. These uniforms were the road get-ups the Jazz wore during the heyday of the John Stockton\/Karl Malone-era teams, squads often among the best in the Western Conference. \u201cThese classic jerseys are an instant visual connection to our rich and storied past in the state of Utah,\u201d Jazz senior vice president of marketing Bart Sharp said in a statement. \u201cOur 40th season celebration is a natural time to reflect on the past and all we have shared together with the fans of Utah, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to look ahead to what is undoubtedly an exciting time for this franchise and the entire state.\u201d * * * > More from Shiny & New Week"},{"id":38221,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-bucks-new-arena-fiserv-forum","date":"2018-10-11","title":"Milwaukee Bucks enter new era at Fiserv Forum","content":" The Milwaukee Bucks have always been at home on North 4th Street. The team\u2019s first arena, best known as The MECCA, debuted in 1950 at the corner of 4th and Kilbourn Avenue. It was the home arena for the Milwaukee Hawks from 1955-58 and became home for the Bucks when the NBA franchise debuted in 1968. The Bucks were dominant at The MECCA, posting the third-most wins in the NBA from 1968-88. In 1978, the arena unveiled one of the most ambitious court designs in NBA history, which was created by artist Robert Indiana .  After great success at The MECCA, the Bucks moved across the street in 1988 to the Bradley Center on the corner of 4th and State. The Bradley Center, which was built with funds donated by the family of Harry Lynde Bradley, was the Bucks\u2019 home for 30 years. However, unlike The MECCA, the Bradley Center wasn\u2019t home to sustained success for the Bucks. > Several teams update arenas, courts for 2018-19 Now, the Bucks move another block north on 4th Street (recently re-named Vel R. Phillips Ave.) to their new home \u2014 Fiserv Forum . The state-of-the-art arena brings the Bucks into the 21st century with bright concourses, comfortable seats, a dedicated team store and plenty of other ways to enjoy All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.  The arena design features a \u201cswooping roof and extensive glass to evoke Wisconsin\u2019s natural beauty and Milwaukee\u2019s rich heritage of industry and craftsmen.\u201d The arena will seat roughly 17,500 fans with about 10,000 seats in the lower bowl, 6,000 in the upper deck and the rest in a ring of suites throughout the building.  > Photo Gallery: Detailed Look At Bucks\u2019 New Primary Court  The architects describe the entrance as, \u201ca spacious atrium and wall of east-facing glass with escalators, stairs and balconies at every level to showcase a dynamic environment and visually connect all areas of the arena\u2019s interior.\u201d > Photo Gallery: Milwaukee Art Collection At Fiserv Forum  The block directly in front of the arena is now Herb Kohl Way, a pedestrian-only entertainment plaza for pre- and post-game congregation, special events and more. Kohl owned the Bucks from 1985-2015 and donated $100 million to the construction of the arena when he sold the team to Marc Lasry, Wesley Edens and Jamie Dinan. > Photo Gallery: Inside Bucks Pro Shop At Fiserv Forum  The 714,000 square-foot arena will eventually be surrounded by an active entertainment district with restaurants and shops. This arena district should bring year-round energy to an area of downtown Milwaukee that tends to go quiet when the Bucks or Marquette Golden Eagles aren\u2019t playing games.  In addition to the new arena, the Bucks debuted a new practice facility and medical center last year that sits just west of Fiserv Forum.  The food options at the new arena will feature local restaurants, Milwaukee cuisines and plenty of special menu items. Drink Wisconsibly, a local Milwaukee pub, will give fans plenty of craft beer options to enjoy. > Photo Gallery: Fiserv Forum Unveils MKEat Menu  The new arena wasn\u2019t the only addition for the Bucks this summer.

Today, we look at the Charlotte Hornets, who had a huge advantage in one aspect of the game. The Hornets drew 430 more fouls than they committed last season. That was double the differential of any other team in the league and the second biggest differential of the last 20 years. The Hornets were just the second team in the last 40 years to rank first in both free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) and opponent free throw rate . (The only other was the 2012-13 Lakers .) Those are two important numbers. The most efficient way to score is at the free throw line, and getting there often (while keeping your opponents from doing likewise) is an advantage. The Hornets attempted 8.8 more free throws per game than their opponents and outscored their opponents by 5.7 points per game at the line, both league-high marks. Of course, Dwight Howard was responsible for the Hornets seeing the league\u2019s biggest increase in free throw rate from the season prior. Howard ranked fourth in the league with 582 free throw attempts, 223 more than any Hornet had in 2016-17 . One of the reasons Howard gets fouled so much is that he doesn\u2019t shoot well from the line. His free throw percentage of 57.4 percent ranked 188th among 193 players who attempted at least 100 freebies . Still, a two-shot trip to the line from a 57.4 percent shooter produces 1.15 points, more than the average shot from the field (1.04). Cody Zeller (the Hornets\u2019 starting center both pre and post-Howard) ranked 18th in free throw rate among 222 players with at least 400 field goal attempts in \u201916-17. But at a much lower usage rate than Howard had, Zeller\u2019s free throw rate doesn\u2019t make as much of an impact. So we should expect the Hornets to fall back in the pack in regard to their own ability to get to the line, though the offense isn\u2019t necessarily worse off with Zeller than it was with Howard. The other end of the floor is where the Hornets should remain at or near the top of the league, because they\u2019ve been there for a while now. Charlotte ranked in the top five in opponent free throw rate in all five of former coach Steve Clifford\u2019s years on the bench, leading the league in each of the last two seasons. Last season, Kemba Walker (1.3) and Nicolas Batum (1.3) were both in the top four in regard to fewest fouls per 36 minutes (minimum 1,000 total minutes). Frank Kaminsky, meanwhile, averaged the second fewest per 36 (1.9) among players 6-10 and taller . The Hornets have also ranked first or second in defensive rebounding percentage in each of the last five seasons. Under Clifford, they did not let opponents get to the line or get second chances. And that helped them rank in the top 10 in defensive efficiency in Clifford\u2019s three seasons. But eventually, there was some slippage in regard to opponent effective field goal percentage (the most important number on defense) and the Hornets ranked 17th defensively in each of the last two seasons. An advantage at the free throw line is great. An advantage in the ability to makes shots from the field is better. The Hornets\u2019 best season (48-34 in 2015-16) was the only one in their 14 years of existence in which they had a higher effective field goal percentage than their opponents.

Today, we look at the Sacramento Kings, who set a record for not getting to the line. The Kings attempted 19.4 free throws per 100 shots from the field. That was the lowest free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) in NBA history. League-wide free throw rate has been trending down for the last 12 years and hit an all-time low of 25.2 attempts per 100 shots from the field last season. (The previous low was 26.1 in 1972-73.) Nine of the 18 lowest free throw rates in league history have come in the last two seasons, with last season\u2019s Bulls, Knicks and Mavs joining the Kings in the bottom 10. If you compare teams\u2019 free throw rates vs. the league average, the Kings had just the 29th biggest discrepancy (-5.8) in the league\u2019s 72 seasons. Still, ranking last in free throw rate is not good. Getting to the line is the most efficient way to score. To get to the line, you generally have to get the basket. The Kings ranked 26th in drives per game and 28th in the percentage of their shots that came from the restricted area. In regard to personnel, the Kings are young. Last season, they led the league in the percentage of their minutes that were played by rookies (34 percent) and by rookies and second-year players combined (54 percent). But in regard to their playing style, the Kings are old-school. They ranked last in both pace (possessions per 48 minutes) and the percentage of their shots that came from the restricted area or 3-point range. The Kings actually ranked third in 3-point percentage at 37.5 percent. They just didn\u2019t take advantage of that skill. Zach Randolph, of course, remains old-school. In addition to having a free throw rate of just 0.140 (the seventh lowest rate among 94 players 6-9 or taller who attempted at least 300 shots from the field), Randolph took only 47 percent of his shots from between the restricted area and 3-point range, the 14th lowest rate among 222 players with at least 400 total field goal attempts. But in that regard, Randolph was outdone by a pair of teammates that were three and five years old when he was drafted. De\u2019Aaron Fox and Skal Labissiere took 47 percent and 40 percent of their shots, respectively, from between the restricted area and 3-point range. Those were the 12th and fifth lowest rates among the 222 players who took at least 400 shots total. There were 11 Kings who attempted at least 300 shots last season , and all 11 were below the league average (65 percent) in regard to the percentage of their shots that came from the most efficient areas of the floor. The closest was Garrett Temple, who was traded in July. New forward Nemanja Bjelica took 79 percent of his shots from the restricted area (30 percent) or 3-point range (49 percent), but was one of the six players 6-foot-9 or taller with at least 300 field goal attempts and a lower free throw rate than Randolph (0.121). The Kings remain in player development mode, with nine guys in their first, second or third seasons. And in regard to team development, they\u2019d benefit from better shot selection and more trips to the line. Note: Stats marked with an * below are based on possession estimates.

Butler reportedly verbally challenged teammates, coaches and the front office during the practice session. According to Wojnarowski , Butler yelled, \u201cyou can\u2019t win without me,\u201d at GM Scott Layden during the practice. His actions reportedly left his teammates and coaches \u201cspeechless.\u201d http:\/\/www.nba.com\/article\/2018\/10\/10\/lonzo-ball-make-preseason-debut-vs-warriors https:\/\/twitter.com\/wojespn\/status\/1050102068185321474 Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the practice: Butler spoke with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols on Wednesday afternoon to explain his actions during practice. \u201cA lot of it is true. You have to think \u2026 I haven\u2019t played played basketball in so long,\u201d Butler told Nichols. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so passionate. And I love the game. And I don\u2019t do it for any other reason except to compete and go up against the best to try to prove that I can hang.\u201d \u201cSo all of my emotion came out at one time. Was it the right way to do it? No. But I can\u2019t control that when I\u2019m out there competing. That\u2019s my love of the game. That\u2019s raw me. Me at my finest, my purest. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get inside the lines.\u201d \u201cI was honest,\u201d Butler continued. \u201cWas I brutally honest? Yes. But I think that\u2019s the problem. Everybody is so scared to be honest with one another. If you didn\u2019t like the way I handled myself in practice, one of the players come up to me. Somebody say something. Anybody. I\u2019m not going to take offense. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d Krawczynski reported via Twitter that Wolves forward Anthony Tolliver said the following about Butler : \u201cHe was \u2026 around. That\u2019s really all I gotta say about that.\u201d http:\/\/www.nba.com\/article\/2018\/10\/10\/report-heat-want-restart-jimmy-butler-talks Days ago, multiple news outlets reported that a trade between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Miami Heat for Jimmy Butler had fallen apart . However, that apparently hasn\u2019t kept the Heat from showing interest in rekindling trade talks with the Wolves for their disgruntled All-Star guard. Wojnarowski reports that the Heat remain interested in restarting trade talks with the Wolves after the deal that seemed close to happening collapsed on Saturday . Yesterday, Butler reportedly informed Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau that he still wants to be traded , per The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania and Krawczynski. Butler had been away from the team while the Wolves were in California for a preseason bonding trip . Proposed changes from Minnesota created a breakdown in earlier trade negotiations just as the teams were close to finalizing a deal. The teams reportedly advanced to the point of exchanging player medical information, which is typically the last step of NBA trade negotiations. Except for this trade, the Timberwolves responded with an amendment to the framework of the deal, according to Wojnarowski , which caused the trade talks to \u201cfracture\u201d. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 59 games for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. Still, it seems the Heat are perhaps the only serious contender for Butler at this point, writes Wojnarowski: Reports circulated in the offseason that Butler was frustrated with the nonchalant attitudes of Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Next season, Wiggins will begin playing on his maximum contract in 2018-19, with a $25 million-plus salary that will account for more than 20 percent of the team\u2019s cap and push the Timberwolves close to the luxury tax threshold. Towns signed an extension with the Wolves shortly after training camp opened , securing his place in Minnesota for years to come. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round.

Winter\u2019s family said he died Wednesday in Manhattan, where he began his coaching career at Kansas State in 1947 and led the Wildcats to two Final Fours and eight Big Seven\/Eight titles as head coach from 1954-68. \u201dI learned so much from Coach Winter. He was a pioneer and a true student of the game,\u201d Michael Jordan said in a statement emailed to the Chicago Tribune. \u201dHis triangle offense was a huge part of our six championships with the Bulls. He was a tireless worker. Tex was always focused on details and preparation and a great teacher. I was lucky to play for him. My condolences to his family.\u201d Winter published \u201dThe Triple-Post Offense\u201d in 1962 and teamed with Jackson to use the system to great success with Jordan and Kobe Bryant. Winter assisted Jackson on championship teams with the Bulls in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997 and 1998, and the Lakers in 2000, 2001, 2002. He was a consultant with Los Angeles\u2019 2009 title team, and the Lakers also won in 2010. \u201dTex Winter was a basketball legend and perhaps the finest fundamental teacher in the history of our game,\u201d said Bulls President John Paxson, a former player under Winter. \u201dHe was an innovator who had high standards for how basketball should be played and approached every day. \u201dThose of us who were lucky enough to play for him will always respect his devotion to the game of basketball. His contributions to the Bulls organization will always be remembered.\u201d Inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011, Winter spent more than six decades in coaching. \u201dOn behalf of the entire Lakers organization, I\u2019d like to express our sadness at the passing of Tex Winter,\u201d Lakers owner Jeanie Buss said in a statement. \u201dTex helped lead the team to four NBA championships and was a mentor to many of our coaches and players.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Winter family.\u201d Kobe Bryant shared his thoughts on social media Wednesday night: \u201cMy mentor. I sat with Tex & watched every minute of every game during our 1st season together. He taught me how to study every detail. He was a bball genius in every sense of the word. I\u2019ll miss him deeply. Thank you Tex. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without you. Rest In Peace.\u201d Winter was 451-336 as a college head coach, also directing Marquette (1951-53), Washington (1969-72), Northwestern (1975-78) and Long Beach State (1978-83). He coached the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets in 1972-74, going 51-78. \u201dToday is a sad day for not only Kansas State University but also the entire basketball world with the passing of Coach Winter,\u201d K-State athletic director Gene Taylor said in a statement. \u201dHe transformed the game of basketball at all levels and will always remain an integral piece of our rich basketball tradition here at K-State. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Winter family during this time.

Per team policy, financial terms were not released. Mitchell (6-3, 215, Louisville) led all rookies last season in scoring at 20.5 points per game and total points (1,616), joining David Robinson (1989-90), Larry Bird (1979-80), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1969-70) and Wilt Chamberlain (1959-60) as one of the last five rookies, and only guard, to lead their team in scoring while their squad won 45-or-more games. During the 2017-18 season, Mitchell was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month four times (December, January, February and March\/April), also setting an NBA rookie record for three-pointers made in a single season (187). Following last year\u2019s campaign, Mitchell was unanimously named to the 2017-18 NBA All-Rookie First Team and was dubbed the Breakthrough Athlete of the Year at the 2018 ESPY Awards. The 2018 NBA Slam Dunk Contest winner averaged 24.4 points over 11 postseason games, becoming the first rookie to average over 20 points in the postseason since Tim Duncan in 1998. He set a Jazz playoff rookie scoring record with 33 points against Oklahoma City on April 23, passing Karl Malone who had 31 points on April 20, 1986 against Dallas and then broke his own rookie record with a 38-point performance against the Thunder on April 27 in Game 6, helping Utah advance to the Western Conference Semifinals. The Jazz also announced that they have exercised their third-year team option on center Tony Bradley for the 2019-20 season. Per team policy, financial terms were not released. The-20-year-old Bradley (6-11, 240, North Carolina) was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round (28th overall) of the 2017 NBA Draft, but was acquired by the Jazz in a draft night trade. The Bartow, Fla. native saw action in 24 games (all starts) for the Jazz\u2019s G League affiliate, the Salt Lake City Stars, in 2017-18, owning averages of 15.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.3 blocks in 29.6 minutes per contest. He appeared in nine games for the Jazz, scoring a career-best four points, also grabbing three rebounds, at Oklahoma City on Dec. 20. During the 2018 Utah Jazz Summer League, Bradley appeared in three games, averaging 14.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game, earning a 2018 Utah Jazz Summer League Standout selection. He also posted averages of 16.0 points and 3.5 boards in two contests at the 2018 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. In his sole collegiate season at North Carolina (2016-17), the 6-11 center averaged 7.1 points and 5.1 rebounds in 14.6 minutes per game, helping the Tar Heels to a 2017 NCAA Championship.

Today, we look at the Minnesota Timberwolves, who couldn\u2019t slow down the opposition. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Wolves allowed their opponents to take 20 percent of their shots in the first six seconds of the shot clock. That was the league\u2019s highest rate. For every team in the league, effective field goal percentage is highest in the first six seconds of the shot clock. Last season, league-wide effective field goal percentage was 59 percent in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 52 percent with 6-18 seconds on the clock, and just 43 percent in the last six seconds of the clock, according to Second Spectrum. So good defense starts with good transition defense. And as was the case with the Wolves, bad defense starts with bad transition defense. The 20.1 points per game the Wolves allowed in transition were second most in the league , according to Synergy tracking, and the 110.1 points per 100 possessions they allowed overall had them in the bottom six defensively for the fourth straight season. The Wolves were better than average in regard to forcing turnovers ( they ranked fourth at 15.5 opponent turnovers per 100 possessions ) and keeping their opponents off the line (they ranked 11th in opponent free throw rate ). But they ranked 25th in defensive rebounding percentage and, most importantly, ranked 27th in opponent effective field goal percentage . Their defense wasn\u2019t good inside or out, but was worst at protecting the rim. The Wolves were one of just three teams \u2013 Cleveland and Orlando were the others \u2013 that ranked in the bottom 10 in both opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (66.8 percent \u2013 29th) and the percentage of their opponents shots that came from the restricted area (33 percent \u2013 23rd). Better transition defense, of course, would lead to fewer layups and dunks for the Wolves\u2019 opponents. But you have to wonder if the Wolves can get better defensively if they\u2019re forced to trade Jimmy Butler. The Wolves allowed 12.9 fast break points per 48 minutes. That number was lowest (11.0 per 48) with Tyus Jones on the floor . But Butler\u2019s presence seemed to have a positive impact as well, with Minnesota opponents averaging 12.0 fast break points per 48 minutes with Butler on the floor and 13.9 per 48 with him off the floor. Overall, the Wolves allowed 6.8 fewer points per 100 possessions with Butler on the floor (105.6) than they did with him off the floor (112.4). They saw a similar boost on offense (where they scored 6.4 more points per 100 possessions) with him on the floor. Those numbers require some context. The Wolves\u2019 bench was bad, with huge drop-offs when Butler was replaced by Jamal Crawford and when Karl-Anthony Towns was replaced by Gorgui Dieng. Still, if the Wolves lose Butler, they\u2019re losing their best two-way player. Either way, if they\u2019re going to get better defensively, improvement has to start in transition.

Today, we look at the Brooklyn Nets, who couldn\u2019t turn their opponents over. The Nets allowed their opponents to take just 57 percent of their shots from the restricted area or 3-point range. That was, by far, the lowest rate in the league as shots from the restricted area (worth 1.23 points per attempt league-wide over the last three years) and from beyond the arc (1.07) are the most efficient ones. Forcing a lot of shots in between (worth just 0.81 points per attempt) is a good thing. There is a correlation between shot-location defense (the percentage of your opponents shots that come from the restricted area or 3-point range) and overall defensive efficiency. Four of the bottom five teams in points allowed per 100 possessions \u2014 Chicago, Cleveland, Memphis and Sacramento \u2014 ranked in the bottom six in forcing shots in between the restricted area and the 3-point line. But the Nets ranked 21st defensively (in the bottom 10 for the fourth straight season), despite forcing the right shots. They couldn\u2019t turn their shot-location success into overall defensive success, because their defense was otherwise was too soft. The Nets forced those shots in between by keeping their bigs back in the paint against pick-and-rolls, the same basic scheme that the league\u2019s No. 1 defense \u2014 that of the Utah Jazz \u2014 employed. It allowed Brooklyn to rank sixth in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (61.1 percent). It also kept the ball in the hands of the initial ball-handler, because he wasn\u2019t forced to give it up. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Nets allowed 280 more points (3.4 more per game) than any other team from pick-and-roll ball-handlers . They were at the top of the league in the percent of opponent possessions (22.3 percent) that were pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions and in how efficiently their opponents scored (0.91 points per possession) on those possessions . Being at the top of the league in the latter is not a good thing. While the Nets had the highest opponent rate of opponent shots that came from between the restricted area and 3-point range, they also had the highest opponent field goal percentage on those shots in between. Even at a league-high 42.6 percent, those shots in between were worth only 0.85 points per attempt \u2014 far less than the value of restricted area or 3-point shots. The Nets\u2019 bigger problem on defense was their inability to force turnovers. They forced just 12.3 per 100 possessions, the league\u2019s lowest rate by a pretty comfortable margin . According to Synergy, their opponent turnover rate (9.4 percent) on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions was also the lowest rate in the league by far (and less than half the rate of three different teams). Furthermore, only 50.4 percent of Brooklyn opponent turnovers, the league\u2019s second lowest opponent rate, were live balls. They had just one player (Caris LeVert \u2014 3.2) in the top 75 in deflections per 36 minutes . Fewer live balls result in fewer transition opportunities for an offense that ranked 22nd . It wasn\u2019t just about deflecting the passes their opponents threw. It was also about not having their opponents throw that many passes. Brooklyn opponents recorded assists on just 52 percent of their field goals, the league\u2019s lowest rate and well below the league average of 59 percent. The Nets have the framework of a good defense. The challenge now is getting more active and disruptive within that framework. Note: Stats marked with an * below are based on possession estimates.

That doesn\u2019t just apply to the players, though, as coaches and teams often part ways or join up once the offseason begins, too. The summer of 2018 was no different. Eight teams found new coaches \u2026 and one team gave its interim coach the full-time gig. Here\u2019s a quick look at the new faces holding clipboards in 2018-19: * * *  In:  Lloyd Pierce Out:  Mike Budenholzer The Hawks have declined in each of the past three seasons, falling from 60 wins and an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals to last year\u2019s 24-win showing. Enter Pierce, who immediately staked his claim on the defensive end. \u201cThat\u2019s who I am,\u201d he said. Second-year GM Travis Schlenk puts even more value on his experience with the Sixers\u2019 grueling rebuild , which will be put to good use as the Hawks begin their own renovation in earnest. * * *  In: James Borrego Out:  Steve Clifford The architect of multiple championship teams with the Lakers, new GM Mitch Kupchak chose a fellow title winner to man the sidelines in Borrego, a Spurs assistant from 2003-10 and again from 2015-18. He\u2019s lauded for his player-development skills, and he\u2019ll need them with a Hornets team that has been treading water for years. * * * In:  Dwane Casey O ut:  Stan Van Gundy The Pistons were only too happy to pounce on Casey after his surprise firing in Toronto . While the Raptors could never scale the mountain that was the LeBron James-led Cavaliers, they still enjoyed the best stretch in franchise history on his watch. But the standards are higher in Detroit, where three championship banners hang, and the widely-respected Casey says he\u2019s ready to chase it: \u201cWe want to win right now.\u201d * * *  In:  J.B. Bickerstaff Out:  David Fizdale Bickerstaff\u2019s interim record in replacement of Fizdale wasn\u2019t good (15-48). But the Grizzlies were still impressed with his performance, particularly his ability to connect with players and foster a positive atmosphere despite Memphis\u2019 worst finish in a decade. Aiding Bickerstaff\u2019s task will be the return of veteran point guard Mike Conley Jr. following season-ending surgery and the addition of promising rookie forward Jaren Jackson Jr. * * * In:  Mike Budenholzer Out:  Jason Kidd, Joe Prunty Budenholzer\u2019s job is simple: Forging a contender around the immense abilities of franchise star Giannis Antetokoumpo. His emphasis on ball and player movement, keys to his early success with the Hawks before the roster fell apart, should help the Bucks improve on their mediocre 3-point shooting. In his own words, however, the bigger task will be \u201cunlocking\u201d their defensive potential after finishing 19th in points per 100 possessions .   * * * In:  David Fizdale O ut:  Jeff Hornacek  The Knicks\u2019 perpetual rebuilding job now falls to Fizdale, who reportedly turned down an offer from the Suns in the hopes of landing in Gotham. While the Knicks have won a grand total of one playoff series since their last Finals appearance in 1999 , it\u2019s not hard to see why. All-Star big man Kristaps Porzingis is one of the NBA\u2019s best young players (when healthy) and there should be enough cap space to make waves next summer . * * *  In:  Steve Clifford Out:  Frank Vogel Clifford\u2019s results in Charlotte \u2014 two playoff appearances in five seasons, a .478 win percentage \u2014 were generally uninspiring. Clifford remains respected, however, primarily for his defensive acumen. But the Hornets finished in the top 10 in offensive efficiency just once under his stewardship, and that could be a problem for a Magic team that was no better than mediocre in most stats season. * * *  In:  Igor Kokoskov Out:  Earl Watson, Jay Triano The Suns made history by hiring Kokoskov, who became the first NBA coach born and raised outside the U.S. He\u2019s a rookie in name only, though. The Serbian native has been an NBA assistant since 2000, including a lengthy stint with the Suns from 2008-13. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a European coach,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an NBA coach.\u201d This much seems certain: He\u2019s got great timing, returning to Phoenix just as No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton arrives.  * * *  In:  Nick Nurse Out:  Dwane Casey Casey wasn\u2019t the first coach to ever be sacked after a string of disappointing playoff results. He is, however, only the fourth Coach of the Year to not return the following season thanks to his dismissal after a sweep at the hands of the Cavaliers . Nurse, who takes over after five seasons as a Raptors assistant, already has two advantages over his predecessor: Kawhi Leonard is in uniform, and LeBron James is off to the Western Conference. * * * * * * The views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting."},{"id":38279,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/shiny-and-new-rookies-watch-2018-19","date":"2018-10-10","title":"Ayton, Doncic among 10 key rookies to watch in 2018-19","content":" What\u2019s more Shiny and New than a raw, talented class of rookie class ready to show off what it\u2019s got? The beauty of the NBA is that every season brings a fresh crop of young talent, many of whom are able to step in and contribute in big ways right away. So which of this year\u2019s rookies will shine brightest? Here\u2019s a look at five leading candidates for Kia Rookie of the Year (and a few others to keep an eye on). * * * All eyes will be on the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 Draft immediately, and not just because of his size. The chiseled center will be the focus of the offense immediately with current star Devin Booker still rusty to start the season coming off a hand injury . Ayton, at 7-foot-1, has the size and athletic ability to make an instant impact on a franchise that doesn\u2019t have a long list of dominant centers. Through the Suns\u2019 first three preseason games, Ayton is averaging 21.3 points and 12.7 rebounds in 30 minutes per game. He\u2019s finished several alley-oops off pick and rolls and shown the ability to knock down the mid-range jumper. He likely won\u2019t approach those numbers \u2013 especially when Booker returns \u2014 but about 15 points and 10 rebounds a night isn\u2019t hard to imagine. The Suns are still far off from challenging in the crowded West, but Ayton should at least be in the running for Kia Rookie of the Year. Doncic is just 19 years old, but thanks to his experience playing in Spain , many see him as the favorite to take home Kia Rookie of the Year honors. And it\u2019s not hard to see why. The Slovenian playmaker comes to the league with a reputation as a ballhandling floor general in the mold of Hall of Famer Jason Kidd, but with outside range to match. So far in the preseason, that range and passing ability has been on display. At 6-foot-7, Doncic is a tough matchup for opponents. Slower defenders can\u2019t handle his ballhandling or 3-point range, and he has the size to bully smaller defenders. The Mavs are starting him as a forward, but his versatility allows him to do a little bit of everything based on the matchups. With the Mavericks likely to be out of the playoff mix in the loaded West, Doncic should have every opportunity to put up big numbers. He\u2019ll definitely be a must-see on NBA League Pass all season. Thanks to the Hawks\u2019 Draft night trade with the Mavericks , Young will forever be tied to Doncic and enters the season facing immediate pressure. Did Atlanta make the wrong move? Should they have stuck with Doncic? Only time will tell, but Hawks fans will be constantly checking box scores to compare the pair. Young will have every chance to prove his worth right away as the starter for a team lacking a superstar but filled with unsung young, athletic talent. John Collins has breakout potential, giving Young a big man to connect with \u2014 Young is averaging five assists per game in the preseason \u2014 but there\u2019s not much else to get excited about. It ultimately will be Young\u2019s ability to knock down shots that will determine his future. So far, the results have been underwhelming for the 6-foot-2 guard, who struggled in NBA Summer League and is hitting at a 35.9 percent clip (25 percent on 3s) through three preseason games. Until he can figure out how to score in the NBA as an undersized guard, those shooting numbers will likely continue. However, scoring and playmaking should be there and keep Young in the spotlight and in consideration for the Kia ROY. The Bulls are expected to be at the bottom of the Eastern Conference this season, which means they will likely turn more and more to their big man from Duke. He\u2019ll start the season coming off the bench to spell Robin Lopez at center (Fred Hoiberg says Carter will play exclusively at center), but he could see more time \u2014 including crunch-time minutes \u2014 as he continues to grow. With Lauri Markkanen out to start the season , Carter will be able to contribute right away. His numbers from NBA Summer League \u2014 14.6 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 2.6 bpg, 55.1 FG pct. \u2014 have Bulls fans excited to see what\u2019s next for the 19-year-old. Carter has already won over his fellow rookies, as they tabbed him in NBA.com\u2019s Rookie Survey as the player who will have the best NBA career . We\u2019ll have to see how that plays out, but it\u2019s likely Carter could end up being a steal as the Draft\u2019s No. 7 pick . LeBron James is gone, and so are the Cavs\u2019 hopes to come out of the East. They\u2019ve still got veteran talent with Kevin Love, George Hill and Kyle Korver, but if things go south (as some expect), Sexton should find himself playing more of a central role. Already he\u2019s projected to play heavy minutes \u2014 whether starting alongside Hill or backing him up \u2014 and should put up decent numbers. He\u2019s a scoring point guard more than a distributor, averaging 19.2 ppg (compared to 3.6 assists per game) in his lone season at Alabama. Sexton, of course, was the primary scoring option for the Crimson Tide, who relied on him to be a playmaker who could get to the rim \u2014 which is how he scored most of his points. The knock on him entering the Draft was his outside shooting, so if he can improve in that arena, he could find himself making a name for himself. Kevin Knox, New York Knicks: With Kristaps Porzingis still out , Knox will have a chance to shine right away. He\u2019s got the size and outside touch to make a mark at Madison Square Garden and become a starter and building block for the Knicks. Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings: The No. 2 pick should contribute right away, thanks to an NBA-ready body and a Kings team looking for a star. Bagley has the size and athleticism to compete in the post, with an outside shot that will only improve. He very easily could approach double-double averages. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies: The No. 4 pick has the size (6-foot-11 with a 7-foot-4 wingspan) to give Memphis a rim protector on defense and the shooting touch to knock down the outside shot. He might not see as much playing time as other rookies right away, but he has the added bonus of being mentored by Marc Gasol, which should help his long-term prospects. Mo Bamba, Orlando Magic: Bamba will make his mark this season on the defensive end, which should please new coach Steve Clifford. Bamba has the size and athleticism \u2014 and wingspan \u2014 to give Orlando a true rim protector (alongside Jonathan Isaac) down low. He won\u2019t likely put up big offensive numbers, but he should be top five among rookies in rebounding and blocks. Miles Bridges, Charlotte Hornets: Bridges will see plenty of playing time thanks to his ability to play multiple positions. New coach James Borrego is already raving about Bridges\u2019 versatility and his quick learning curve. He should help anchor the second unit and could approach double-digits in scoring thanks to a high motor and ability to step out and hit from beyond the arc. * * * > More from Shiny & New Week * * * The views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting."},{"id":38277,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/familiar-faces-new-places-2018-19","date":"2018-10-10","title":"24 familiar faces in new places heading into 2018-19","content":" 2018 NBA offseason : East player movement | West player movement | Complete coverage  * * * There isn\u2019t an offseason in sports that can compare to the NBA\u2019s.

It\u2019s been that way seemingly forever in a sport that\u2019s been a \u201cyoung man\u2019s game\u201d since players were shooting in peach baskets. And why would the next generation want to wait their turn rather than chasing the throne now? Jayson Tatum\u2019s prized possession going into his rookie season with the Boston Celtics was a photo of himself as a young boy with LeBron James towering over him. That was before he posterized his boyhood idol in the Eastern Conference finals last season. Joel Embiid has preached for years about \u201ctrusting the process,\u201d while doing everything in his power to accelerate it every time he takes the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers. Even Donovan Mitchell, as surprising and humble as any young star to enter the league in recent memory, showed little regard for his elders in the playoffs last season. He helped Utah topple the reigning Kia MVP ( Russell Westbrook ) and put a scare into the next Kia MVP (James Harden) as the Jazz reached the Western Conference semifinals . As one generation of NBA stars begins fades into their twilight years, the next generation is chomping at the bit to rise up. Tatum, Embiid and Mitchell are just three of the headliners of the game\u2019s next wave of superstars, all currently under the age of 25. Here\u2019s a quick look at the 10 best on that list \u2026 (Note: These are in alphabetical order, so argue amongst yourselves about the pecking order) * * * Age:  23 2017-18 Season Stats:  26.9 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 1.4 bpg The skinny:  \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d has lived up to his nickname by becoming one of the most freakishly talented and impactful players in the game. The only thing missing from his arsenal is a consistent stroke from the perimeter. And he\u2019s already a legitimate MVP candidate without it. He\u2019s the heir to LeBron\u2019s throne as the top player in the East and perhaps, one day \u2026 the league. * * * Age:  21 2017-18 Season Stats:  24.9 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 4.7 apg The skinny:  Booker has earned the distinction as the best shooter outside of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 locker room after just three seasons in the league. But he\u2019s more than just a lights-out shooter. He\u2019ll celebrate his 22nd birthday later this month (Oct. 30) alongside two other young studs, No. 1 overall pick DeAndre Ayton and second-year swingman Josh Jackson. * * * Age:  21 2017-18 Season Stats:  14.5 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 1.6 apg The skinny:  Focus strictly on the raw numbers with Brown and you might miss the beyond-his-years nuance to his game. One of two Boston youngsters on this list (Tatum is the other), his role was expanded last season due to Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury. The Celtics\u2019 No. 2 scorer in the playoffs, Brown\u2019s a potentially elite two-way player on the deepest team in the league. * * * Age:  24 2017-18 Season Stats:  22.9 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 1.8 bpg The skinny:  Embiid didn\u2019t waste any time announcing himself as the best and most dynamic big man in the league. He\u2019s already an All-Star, was All-NBA Second Team last season and is the league\u2019s social media troll MVP. Where Embiid\u2019s game is concerned, there is reason to believe the hype. He led the Sixers to 52 wins last season and with Ben Simmons, gives the Sixers a big man\/point guard punch that no team can match. * * * Age:  23 2017-18 Season Stats:  18.5 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 6.1 apg The skinny: Jokic might be the most dynamic and underrated player of this entire bunch. He can score from all over the floor, rebounds the way you want a 7-footer to and is perhaps the best-passing big man in the NBA . Credit the Nuggets for allowing him the freedom to play to his abilities while the rest of the league deals with his unique combination of size and skill. * * * Age:  22 2017-18 Season Stats:  20.5 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.7 apg The skinny:  Not since Damian Lillard has the league been treated to a surprising breakout rookie season like the one Mitchell turned in with the Jazz . And as good as he was through the course of the regular season, he played like a superstar in the postseason (24.4 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 4.2 apg). A physical dynamo with some of the quickest and most explosive hops in the league, Mitchell already operates like a seasoned NBA player. * * * Age:  23 2017-18 Season Stats:  22.7 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 2.4 bpg The skinny:  A torn ACL interrupted an All-Star season for the 7-foot-3 Latvian star dubbed \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d by two-time Finals MVP Kevin Durant. While there is no timetable for his return , there is no way you can deny Porzingis a spot on this list. The league has never seen a player his size sport the sort of skills he displayed in 2017-18. * * * Age:  22 2017-18 Season Stats:  15.8 ppg, 8.2 apg, 8.1 rpg The skinny:  While his perimeter shooting is still in the development stage , it would be wise to focus your attention on all the other things Simmons can do as the league\u2019s biggest (6-foot-10 and 230 pounds) and most dynamic point guard. It\u2019s no coincidence the Sixers finally took off after Smmons turned in his Kia Rookie of the Year season . And he\u2019s only scratched the surface of the player he can become. * * * Age:  20 2017-18 Season Stats:  13.9 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.6 apg The skinny:  Tatum turned in a fantastic rookie season \u2026 and then took his game to the next level in the playoffs. He led the Celtics in postseason scoring as they scrapped their way to the conference finals against LeBron and Cleveland . Once there, Tatum made it clear that he was more than ready for prime time (ask the Cavaliers). The frightening part for the rest of the league (and the best part for Celtics coach Brad Stevens) is that Tatum won\u2019t turn 21 until March 3. * * * Age:  22 2017-18 Season Stats:  21.3 ppg, 12.3 rpg, 1.4 bpg The skinny: Fair or not, Towns has seen his reputation take repeated hits during the Timberwolves\u2019 tumultuous offseason . Still, there\u2019s no denying his place among the elite young players \u2013 and, in particular, big men \u2014 in the league. Lost in the summer drama is the fact that in an era where countless young stars have endured injury and health issues to start their careers, Towns has started all 82 games in each of his first three seasons. * * * The Next Five:  Clint Capela, Houston Rockets; Aaron Gordon, Orlando Magic; Brandon Ingram, Los Angeles Lakers; Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets; Myles Turner; Indiana Pacers * * * > More from Shiny & New Week Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Coach Luke Walton announced in Tuesday\u2019s practice that Ball will come off the bench in tonight\u2019s preseason home game against the Golden State Warriors ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). Ball has been sidelined more than six months because of left knee injury woes that began in late March and led to arthroscopic surgery in July. He has participated in most of training camp after not being cleared for the start of camp to participate in full-contact practice. The former No. 2 pick in the 2017 Draft , Ball said Tuesday he is simply looking forward to playing again. \u201cIt gets frustrating when you play basketball for your whole life and then it gets taken from you for a little bit,\u201d Ball said. As he recovered from his injury, Ball used the time he wasn\u2019t doing on-court workouts to bulk up for the 2018-19 season. He estimates that he added 15-20 pounds over the summer, making his weight between 205 and 210 pounds. Walton will start veteran guard Rajon Rondo tonight, but said he is looking forward to moments when Rondo and Ball will be on the court together. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, because they\u2019re both selfless, playmaking guards that make their teammates better,\u201d Walton said. \u201cThose are the type of guys we want on the floor. Most of the time, to be able to have at least one of those guys at the point is a big plus for us.\u201d Fellow second-year Lakers guard Josh Hart is listed as questionable tonight. He tweaked his hamstring early in Monday\u2019s practice, causing some concern, but Walton said Hart is doing fine now. \u201cHe wanted to practice today, but it was tight still, so I told him to just sit out and watch, make sure that he stays healthy,\u201d Walton said. \u201cHe\u2019s very important to what we do, so we want to start the season as healthy as can be, so it was more just being safe today and not letting him go.\u201d Ball played in just 52 games during his rookie season, but was back on the court in early June and said he was feeling \u201c100 percent\u201d following a knee procedure . Per reports, the former No. 2 overall pick received a platelet-rich plasma shot for the ailing left knee that kept him out of the final portion of the regular season. In the 2017-18 season, Ball averaged 10.2 points, 7.2 assists and 6.9 rebounds per contest while shooting 36 percent en route to earning NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. Over the summer, the Lakers added Rondo to a training camp point guard rotation that also includes Alex Caruso, Issac Bonga and Joel Berry II. Marquee free-agent addition LeBron James is a more than skilled NBA playmaker as well. He could easily initiate and direct some of the Lakers\u2019 offense this season."},{"id":38248,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zhou-qi-exits-preseason-game-leg-injury","date":"2018-10-10","title":"Zhou Qi exits preseason game with knee sprain","content":"Rockets forward Zhou Qi exited Tuesday\u2019s preseason game with a knee sprain suffered during awkward scramble for a loose ball.

Today, we look at the Memphis Grizzlies, who couldn\u2019t take care of the ball without their point guard. The Grizzlies committed 15.6 turnovers per 100 possessions last season. That rate ranked 28th and was up from 13.7 ( ninth ) in 2016-17. The additional 1.9 turnovers per 100 possessions was the league\u2019s biggest increase. The Grizzlies have been no better than average offensively in any of the last 11 seasons. When they\u2019ve won, they\u2019ve won with defense. But last season, in which they ranked 27th and scored 4.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average, was their worst offensive season since 2008-09. Even though the Grizzlies ranked 19th the season prior , only the Celtics saw a bigger drop in points scored per 100 possessions from \u201916-17 to \u201917-18. Even when healthy, the Grizzlies have not been a good shooting team. They\u2019ve ranked in the bottom three in effective field goal percentage in each of the last three seasons. But they\u2019ve managed to be a not-so-terrible offensive team overall by getting to the free throw line, grabbing offensive rebounds and taking care of the ball. Last season, they saw drop-offs in both free throw rate and offensive rebounding percentage. But where they fell off most was in turnover rate , the second most important of the \u201cfour factors\u201d on offense (behind effective field goal percentage). And it\u2019s fairly easy to draw a connection between that drop-off and the absence of point guard Mike Conley. Two seasons ago, the Grizzlies scored 10.8 more points per 100 possessions with Conley on the floor (109.0) than they were with him off the floor (98.2). With Conley on the floor, they committed just 12.9 turnovers per 100 possessions (a rate which would have ranked fourth). With him off the floor, they committed 14.1 per 100 (a rate which would have ranked 14th). Conley himself committed just 9.0 turnovers per 100 possessions. That was the sixth lowest rate among 57 players who had an assist ratio of 20 or more assists per 100 possessions . Through 13 games last season, the Grizzlies were 7-6 and ranked second in turnover rate (14.3 per 100 possessions). But Game 13 was Conley\u2019s last and the second game of an 11-game losing streak. After Conley\u2019s injury, Memphis ranked 29th in both turnover rate (15.8 per 100 possessions) and offensive efficiency (103.2 points scored per 100 possessions). A healthy Conley is not going to make the Grizzlies a great offensive team. Perimeter shooting is still going to be an issue in Memphis. But with their point guard back and taking care of the ball, the Grizzlies will at least get to shoot more often. Note: Stats marked with an * below are based on possession estimates.

The brutal news Monday that San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray had suffered a torn right ACL the day before in a preseason loss to Houston hit the team hard. Murray\u2019s on-the-job training last season got solid results (8.1 points, 5.7 rebounds per game and an All-Defensive second team nod ), as the Spurs were looking to the 22-year-old to set a faster, more aggressive pace for 2018-19 while serving as the point of their defensive spear. Now Murray\u2019s season presumably is over. Veteran Patty Mills and second-year guard Derrick White will likely fill Murray\u2019s spot. And coming on the heels of top draft pick Lonnie White IV\u2019s torn meniscus that could cost the rookie two months or more, it made for a lousy weekend. In a challenging preseason. After the most convulsive summer in franchise history. This was the offseason in which \u201cthe Spurs way\u201d officially and perhaps forever went from present to past tense. In the span of a few weeks, All-Star point guard Tony Parker signed with the Charlotte Hornets , inscrutable Kia MVP candidate Kawhi Leonard got traded reluctantly to Toronto and Manu Ginobili at age 41 announced his retirement . Add all that to Tim Duncan\u2019s retirement two summers ago and, yes, for the Spurs and their fans, it is as if someone swooped in under cover of darkness and sandblasted away Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and T.R. The crew in place now, the ones wearing the \u201claundry?\u201d Only three current San Antonio players \u2014 LaMarcus Aldridge, Marco Belinelli and Mills \u2014 even played with Duncan. Most of the other players arrived in the past two years.  And then there\u2019s Gregg Popovich, the coach and the constant. Popovich has been around for 23 seasons, the longest tenured coach not just in the NBA, but across all four major U.S. pro sports . He ranks fifth in NBA coaching victories with 1,197, behind only Hall of Famers Don Nelson (1,335), Lenny Wilkens (1,332), Jerry Sloan (1,221) and Pat Riley (1,210). At .689, Popovich is second in NBA winning percentage to Phil Jackson\u2019s .704 \u2014 and unlike all the other names in this paragraph, he has done it with this one franchise. This season, however, is different. Owing to the player departures, San Antonio\u2019s string of 21 consecutive playoff appearances might be in jeopardy. Its streak of 21 straight winning seasons might be, too. Last year, 82 percent of the league\u2019s general managers picked Popovich as the NBA\u2019s best coach in NBA.com\u2019s GM Survey. This year, his support dropped to 30 percent . The tone at the Spurs\u2019 media day reflected current circumstances. The team had suffered a couple more serious and significant hits in recent months \u2014 Popovich\u2019s wife, Erin, passed away in April and former assistant coach Don Newman died 12 days before training camp \u2014 and those were the first two topics the San Antonio coach addressed with reporters. But those heavy, mournful comments bled into a sober, somewhat resigned atmosphere in the gym for the start of the new season. \u201cIn one way, it\u2019s a little bit melancholy because I\u2019d been with them for so long,\u201d Popovich said of his stars\u2019 departures. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s a great opportunity for a new challenge and new energy, a different route, a different perspective. Seeing all the new faces that we have to try to put together will make it a real interesting and challenging year. But in a good way.\u201d After a pause and a follow-up question, he added: \u201cI really don\u2019t know all the names.\u201d Life moves fast, and it\u2019s easy to forget just how good \u2014 and how predictable and stable \u2014 San Antonio had been essentially for two decades. That streak of 21 postseason appearances is just one off the league\u2019s record and produced championships in 1999, \u201803, \u201805, \u201807 and \u201814. Along the way, Popovich, Duncan, Parker and Ginobili set all sorts of marks for winning in various combinations. Inseparable from the on-court success, that group set standards and defined itself with a determined, unadorned, us-rather-than-me approach that often set them 180 degrees apart from typical NBA perceptions. Few invoked the term \u201cculture\u201d before the Spurs concocted theirs and made it so essential to their winning. It\u2019s a stew of maturity, discipline, innovation, flexibility, selflessness, competitiveness, modesty, confidence and trust. It owed large debts to the personalities of the players who shaped it but most of all, it came from Popovich, his own blue-collar background and his vision. Some have questioned his demeanor, others his rapport with sideline reporters. No one has questioned his sincerity. \u201cEverything that Pop did came from his heart,\u201d Golden State coach (and former Spur) Steve Kerr said for the new ESPN documentary, \u201cBasketball: A Love Story. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I think resonated with the players in creating this vision, this culture that guys really love to be part of.\u201d Said Steve Nash, two-time NBA MVP and longtime Spurs rival, for the same project: \u201cHe brings in guys who are intelligent, who will listen, play for each other.\u201d Through the years, the Spurs changed their style \u2014 from the Twin Towers power game with Duncan and David Robinson for the first championship, through incarnations in the new millennium that dialed up or down the offense and defense to suit who was there, right through the elegant, European passing game they mastered for the \u201813 and \u201814 Finals. But their core values never wavered, including the resolve to regroup after having their hearts broken by Miami in \u201913. A year later, older across the board, they paid back the Heat. \u201cFamily\u201d comes and goes in pro sports, mostly as a temporary chemistry thing applied in hindsight. What the Spurs had with Duncan, Parker, Ginobili and Popovich was deeper, more like blood. \u201cTony and Manu developed into the players they are in part because of where they came from,\u201d said San Antonio GM R.C. Buford a while back. \u201cBut more because of the relationship they built amongst each other with Tim and Pop.\u201d Now it\u2019s LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Pau Gasol, Rudy Gay and Pop, with little of the history and none of the pedigree (other than Gasol\u2019s two rings with the Lakers) of the Mount Rushmore group. Constants, even aging ones, have been replaced by variables. \u201cMore than anything,\u201d Popovich said on the eve of camp, \u201cit\u2019s figuring out \u2014 we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility \u2014 so who\u2019s gonna play where and who\u2019s gonna play together? And when are you gonna be big and when are you gonna be small? And what combinations work the best? We don\u2019t have any answers for that yet.\u201d Saying goodbye to Parker was tough. Losing Ginobili sounds like it hit at another level. \u201cIt was sort of a complicated thing,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cBecause when you\u2019re dependent upon someone for that long, for a lot of different reasons \u2014 not just his play on the court but just his combination of understanding people, being as curious as he was about everybody on the team and everything in the world, whether it was politics or religion, it didn\u2019t matter what it was \u2014 he was like a partnership in that respect. Talking on buses and airplanes. So you know that that\u2019s going to be gone.\u201d Ginobili has been invited to work with the coaching staff and hang around as much as he likes \u2014 the Duncan routine these days. Popovich\u2019s wild card on the court from \u201802 through last spring, he sees the changes and how they\u2019ll impact the coach from a different vantage point. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be awkward for him sometimes,\u201d Ginobili told the San Antonio Express-News . \u201cDuring halftime, when he does his thing and he\u2019s not going to see us around. At the same time, it\u2019s going to be a challenge to learn more about the new guys and see what buttons to push. With us, it was already too easy and he already knew us so well. I think it\u2019s going to be a great challenge for him, having a different kind of team.\u201d The first question is whether the Spurs, so transformed, can still win. Of that, Popovich\u2019s peers express little doubt. \u201cI think you underestimate them at your peril,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said before Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cThey traded one All-Star [Leonard] for another All-Star [DeRozan]. So it\u2019s not like all of a sudden they\u2019re gonna fall off the grid. \u2026 They\u2019re really good. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they\u2019re top four.\u201d Said Clippers coach Doc Rivers: \u201cI always look at continuity in two areas. One is coaching \u2014 if you\u2019ve got the same coach, if you\u2019ve got the same system, if you\u2019ve got the same way, you can be better faster. And they have Pop. \u201cNo. 2 is if the top players have not changed. Well, they have, but not really. Their top player is Aldridge and he\u2019s back. The new one is DeRozan and that\u2019s going to be an increase. San Antonio made the playoffs last year and they didn\u2019t have Kawhi [Leonard appeared in just nine games due to a controversial leg injury]. They\u2019re going to be pretty good. I think people are sleeping on \u2018em.\u201d A trickier question is whether the Spurs ever again can formulate the camaraderie, the mutual ambitions \u2014 the culture \u2014 that was their brand for two decades. Can they round up stars who will willingly stay, dominate, lead \u2014 and do it all for below market value? That\u2019s what makes their absence such a double-whammy. The Spurs lose their talents and the ability to retain them at discount rates, which gave Popovich and Buford room to manage the rest of the roster amid salary-cap constraints. The Leonard episode, and trading him to the Raptors with Danny Green, poses a threat to San Antonio\u2019s defense. More than that, though, it dealt a blow to Popovich\u2019s all-mightiness over his guys \u2014 communication clearly broke down \u2014 and his notions of a less dramatic baton pass. The basketball operation still does have the brainiacs who so often have snagged the right players at the right time. The Spurs still embrace and anticipate trends that made them so formidable defensively and with corner 3-pointers. The front office remains a model of stability and there are a few guys in the locker room who can lead. Yet the ones who won and made Spurs culture not a thing but a five-time championship thing, they\u2019re gone.  Popovich\u2019s view of this season sounded humble. That wasn\u2019t necessarily new, but it rang more true this time. \u201cThe goal will be the same as it has been every year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be the best team we can be as the playoffs roll around. Get into the playoffs and do the best job we can.\u201d \u201cThe principles of how we do things, what the process is, will probably stay the same. But there are tweaks every year, whether it\u2019s a tweak on offense, on defense. \u2026 In general, the standards are the same, as far as what we expect.\u201d The standards? OK. The results? To be determined. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Today, we look at the LA Clippers, who continued to score efficiently after the departure of Chris Paul. The Clippers are the only team that has ranked in the top 10 in offensive efficiency in each of the last seven seasons. Only one other team \u2014 the Toronto Raptors \u2014 has ranked in the top 10 in each of the last five seasons. The Golden State Warriors\u2019 current streak is just four straight seasons in the top 10 offensively. James Harden and the Houston Rockets? Two straight seasons. The Clippers\u2019 streak began with the trade for Chris Paul in 2011 . The point guard led the Clippers to six straight trips to the playoffs (after the franchise got there just seven times in its first 41 seasons) and ran the offense that ranked in the top 10 every year he was in L.A. But the streak continued last season, with Paul having moved to Houston, with J.J. Redick having moved to Philadelphia, and with Blake Griffin having been traded to Detroit in late January. The Clippers ranked 10th offensively at the time of the Griffin trade (108.3 points scored per 100 possessions) and ninth offensively thereafter (110.8). The Clippers lost two of the league\u2019s best shooters in Paul and Redick, who rank first and second in mid-range field goal percentage (both at 48.3 percent) among players with at least 750 mid-range attempts over the last five years. Redick (43.5 percent) is the second best 3-point shooter (minimum 750 attempts) over the same timeframe. Without their backcourt of the previous four seasons, the Clippers were one of five teams that ranked in the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage (23rd) and the percentage of shots that came from 3-point range (23rd) last season. But they made up for the losses on the perimeter by improving in the paint. The Clippers went from ranking 28th in the percentage of their shots that came from the paint (42 percent) in 2016-17 to first (55 percent) last season. The jump (13 percent) was more than double that of any other team. The Clippers led the league with 60.5 points per game in the restricted area ( 41.5 ) or on free throws ( 19.0 ). The bigs led the way. LA scored 1.27 points per possession, the best mark in the league , on pick-and-roll roll-man possessions, with Montrezl Harrell (1.40) and DeAndre Jordan (1.25) ranking second and fifth, respectively, among 63 individuals with at last 100 roll-man possessions . There may be seven-footers all over the league stepping out beyond the arc, but the Clippers\u2019 pair proved that you don\u2019t need to shoot 3-pointers to be an effective offensive center. Third on the Clippers in total points in the paint was Lou Williams. While playing a career-high 2,589 minutes , the reigning Kia Sixth Man of the Year also set a career high for points in the paint per 36 minutes (for the second straight season). Williams often carried the Clippers offensively. They scored 12.9 more points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (111.2) than they did with him on the bench (98.3) . That differential was even bigger (15.6 points per 100 possessions) after the Griffin trade . Tobias Harris averaged 19.3 points per game (pretty efficiently) in his 32 games arriving from Detroit, and the Clippers seemingly have the deepest guard rotation in the league. But if they\u2019re going to keep their top-10-offense streak going, they may be counting on Williams more than they did last season. Jordan has moved to Dallas and has been replaced by Marcin Gortat. The Clippers\u2019 new center remains one of the best screeners in the league, but among those 63 players with at last 100 roll-man possessions, Gortat ranked 62nd at 0.88 points scored per possession. Williams just had the best season of his career, and at the age of 32, he may have to pull off a repeat performance to keep the Clippers competitive in the Western Conference.

After that, he must live with the result. It\u2019s a tip Masai Ujiri took from his friend although, as the two shared a newly constructed basketball court in a small village in Kenya three months ago, that was easier said than done. The two Presidents \u2014 one formerly of the U.S., the other currently of the Toronto Raptors \u2014 are linked by a pair of obvious bonds. Both are half-Kenyan and both are passionate about basketball. It was a natural, then, that Obama and Ujiri would find themselves on the same beloved home soil, meaning Africa and the hardwood, for a summer ceremony. Ujiri does tireless work throughout Africa each year , raising awareness of the sport, and his foundation helped build a vastly needed youth center in Kogelo that named a basketball court after Obama. And while Obama appeared that day wearing two Presidential terms of gray in his hair, guess who was more stressed? It was a sensitive time for Ujiri. In a span of a month prior to that Africa trip, he made a pair of tough decisions that severed precious relationships that may eventually serve to repair the Raptors. As Ujiri braces to live with the result, his team is preparing to fly, perhaps further than the franchise has ever traveled. > Season Preview: Toronto Raptors And that, really, was the only reason for firing Dwane Casey and trading DeMar DeRozan , shaking up a franchise that won 59 games but nothing else: Ujiri is hell-bent on chasing a championship, personal feelings be damned. \u201cIt\u2019s the only goal,\u201d he said. As a result, the Raptors are now steered by Nick Nurse, once a respected assistant coach, and more importantly by Kawhi Leonard, largely recognized as one of the game\u2019s most impactful two-way players. It is a dice roll, for sure. There\u2019s no proof yet that Nurse has the chops to navigate a team through a regular season and postseason. Leonard can walk next summer as an unrestricted free agent. Oh, and the Raptors will receive a stern challenge here in a LeBron James-free Eastern Conference by the Boston Celtics, back from the infirmary. The job description in Ujiri\u2019s title demands he put the Raptors in position to seize the moment, as best as possible. And by almost every basketball barometer, he has done that. \u201cI understand sports and sports is about winning,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a mandate to win and that\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d There was a severe degree of discomfort involved in cutting loose the popular Casey and DeRozan. In addition to insuring that two fewer Christmas cards will come to his home this winter, Ujiri gambled with team chemistry by swapping out the most successful coach in Raptors history and a player who helped define this franchise\u2019s existence. Casey was the lesser surprise, but not by much. Last season, he revamped the team\u2019s offense, making it less reliable on DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. He sharpened the defense, which ranked among the league\u2019s best, and lengthened the bench. As a result, the Raptors cruised to a franchise-best record and claimed home court for the playoffs. Yet, there were always whispers within coaching circles that Casey, despite seven years of reasonable success in Toronto (reaching one conference final and two semis), was one bad moment from losing his job. Ujiri inherited Casey from the Bryan Colangelo regime, and in such cases, the new boss usually wants his own guy. Yet Casey didn\u2019t give Ujiri any reason to fire him; on the contrary, Ujiri once extended his contract. In the end, Casey became a victim of his own creation. After securing the No. 1 seed in the East, the stakes rose last spring. Boston was weakened by a season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving, while LeBron and the Cavaliers hiccuped their way through the season and nearly lost in the first round to the plucky Pacers. This was Toronto\u2019s chance. Until it wasn\u2019t. Casey was doomed after a pair of events in the semifinals with Cleveland: He didn\u2019t double LeBron on the superstar\u2019s running one-hander at the Game 3 buzzer (which drew a stern postgame lecture from Ujiri to Casey) and didn\u2019t have his team prepared in Game 4, when the Raptors were swept away, losing by 35 unacceptable points. In that series, DeRozan came up small and was benched in the fourth quarter of Game 3. Initially, the only proposed change was Casey\u2019s job, which Ujiri called \u201cthe hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make.\u201d But when the relationship between Leonard and the Spurs couldn\u2019t be patched and San Antonio put him on the market weeks later, DeRozan was a goner, too. DeRozan took that move personally, vowing to never speak to Ujiri again. But this was business, pure and simple, and to put it bluntly, Leonard is the better player. The guess is almost every GM in basketball would\u2019ve pulled the trigger, even without any future assurances from Leonard. \u201cWhen you get a chance to get a top five player, which doesn\u2019t come very often, you have to jump on it,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201c We \u2019ve given a chance to this team. We\u2019ve tried to build it as much we can. This opportunity came in front of us and we had to jump on it.\u201d He\u2019s correct in this sense: Players with Leonard\u2019s talent rarely become available. They\u2019re known as \u201cdistressed assets,\u201d meaning, an otherwise terrific player whose baggage creates an abrupt change of scenery. For a historical reference, see Jason Kidd from Phoenix (domestic incident) to New Jersey; Shaquille O\u2019Neal from the Lakers (contract demands, Kobe Bryant fallout) to Miami; Dennis Rodman from San Antonio (assorted oddball behavior) to Chicago, etc. In each of the above cases and in others, the arriving player either produced a Finals run (or title) or, at the least, changed the culture of his new team. Leonard has the two-way talent to make positive waves in Toronto. Just five years ago, he shut down LeBron, won a title and was named Finals MVP. Two years ago, before his injury-interrupted season, he was the Kia MVP runner-up after he improved his scoring. And he has every incentive to deliver in 2018-19, with the promise of a big contract beckoning and a chance to repair his image (if he cares, which is debatable) caused by his perceived disloyalty to the Spurs. This is another to add to the list: Carmelo Anthony from the Nuggets (disenchantment) to the Knicks. Curiously, Ujiri was the triggerman on that deal from the Denver side, and it was the move that launched his career. In this particular case, Ujiri worked from a disadvantage; everyone in the league knew he had to move \u2018Melo, who was approaching free agency the next summer and wanted to play in New York. Instead of panicking, Ujiri, then new to the job of general manager, waited until the right deal, then struck, getting assets from the Knicks, enough to help the Nuggets turn the page without suffering on the floor. That helped Ujiri land his dream job in Toronto and also enhanced his rep as one of the best team-builders in basketball. With Leonard, Ujiri has a superstar, someone who can change a game and fit well with Lowry. Otherwise, the Raptors are relatively the same quality team that has lived in the attic of the East and should reside there once again this season. \u201cHe\u2019s super healthy and working like heck,\u201d said Nurse of Leonard. \u201cA special player.\u201d Nurse\u2019s background reads like a coaching gypsy. Five years ago he was in the D-League (now G League) where he won two titles, and before that, he spent 11 years coaching in the British Basketball League. When the Raptors hired him as an assistant, he had no prior NBA experience in any capacity. He was in charge of the offense under Casey. \u201cThis is my first head coaching job in the NBA,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the alternatives, if you look at the seven or eight coaching changes, most of the others are 30, 35-win teams that are a ways away from the playoffs \u2026 we\u2019re firmly entrenched, and rightly so, in the Eastern Conference championship talk. It\u2019s great. We\u2019re where we should be. We\u2019re going to go for it.\u201d Lowry was grumpy for months after the Leonard-DeRozan trade because he and DeRozan were tight on and off the court. But that was just a stubborn show of loyalty to his friend, and besides, time heals. Lowry knows a relationship with Leonard is crucial to the season and that process has begun. \u201cWe have to be on the same page,\u201d Lowry said this preseason, \u201cand we will be on the same page.\u201d Of course, the elephant in the room is Leonard\u2019s contract status. Unless there\u2019s a sudden change in strategy, Leonard won\u2019t sign an extension this season and will weigh his options this summer. Should he bolt for a sunnier situation \u2014 the hometown Lakers or Clippers, perhaps \u2014 Ujiri will be forced to address the next phase of the Raptors. And in that scenario, he could press restart, trade Lowry (whose contract expires in the summer of 2020) and create from scratch. But that\u2019s a season away, and in the meantime, Ujiri has a concept to show to his newest and most important acquisition. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to sell here,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cOur team. Our culture. Our city. Our ownership. We have everything here except a championship in my humble opinion.\u201d Are the retooled Raptors any closer to a championship now than last spring, when LeBron destroyed their dreams? The Celtics will have a say in that, maybe the Sixers as well. Ujiri knows championship windows don\u2019t stay open very long for 95 percent of the league (the Warriors being the exception). You must do what it takes to keep the breeze blowing in, even if tough decisions involve a pair of the most important people in club history. \u201cI have to do everything in this organization to get us to a championship level,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a human side of this business and that\u2019s the part I really struggle with the most \u2026 the human part doesn\u2019t make it easy at all. \u201cOur team (was) just not at that level. We have to do something different, even if it wasn\u2019t this. I could have done anything I wanted.

And after this particular boast, the team proceeded to finish eighth in the Eastern Conference and lose in the first round of the playoffs. There were times when the Wizards lived up to their own hype. They had a winning regular-season record (14-13) against the East\u2019s seven other playoff teams and wins over six of the eight playoff teams in the West. They were one of only two teams \u2014 the Golden State Warriors were the other \u2014 that had a top-10 offense (they ranked 10th) against the league\u2019s top-10 defenses and a top-10 defense (ninth) against the league\u2019s top-10 offenses . The Wizards could play with the best. They just couldn\u2019t take care of business against the worst. Among the 18 teams that finished with winning records last season , the Wizards had the worst record (20-15) against the 12 teams that finished with losing records . They weren\u2019t much better offensively in those 35 games (107.4 points scored per 100 possessions) than they were in 47 games against the other 17 teams that finished above .500 (106.6). The Wizards were without John Wall for 41 games last season and better against bad teams with Wall (14-8) than without him (6-7). But those eight losses in 22 games are more than eight teams had in a full season (minimum of 32 games) against teams that finished under .500. While the Wizards fell to eighth in the East, the Toronto Raptors were the No. 1 seed, largely because they went a league-best 35-2 against the 12 worst teams in the league. Part of being one of the best teams in the conference is beating the worst teams in the conference. Consistency isn\u2019t glamorous, but it certainly gives you more license to talk about how good you are. It\u2019s not clear that the Wizards have been humbled, but head coach Scott Brooks wants them to act like they have. At media day this year, Brooks\u2019 message was \u201cStop talking.\u201d Of course, Markieff Morris would then go on to say that \u201cBoston has never been better than us,\u201d even though the Celtics eliminated the Wizards in the 2017 playoffs and have since added Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward and Jayson Tatum. The Wizards have been a good team for five seasons, but losing in seven games in that 2017 conference semifinals series has been their best postseason result since adding three top-three picks (Wall, Beal and Otto Porter Jr.) in four years (2010-13). Wall, Beal and Porter are still just 28, 25 and 25 years old, respectively, so there are more opportunities ahead. But it remains to be seen how many more years that Washington management is willing to give this core before making a major move. Only one decision-maker placed the Wizards in the top four of the Eastern Conference in NBA.com\u2019s GM Survey , and another year as a 5 seed or lower might be reason enough to go in a new direction. As it stands, the salaries owed to Wall, Beal and Porter have made it impossible for the Wizards to add much to their core. The team\u2019s big offseason move was signing Dwight Howard , who has been discarded by three teams in the last three years. Howard still has the ability to improve a defense that ranked 15th last season and had particular issues with protecting the rim. But questions about chemistry on a team that already lacked it are more than valid. A healthier Wall will help an offense that ranked 14th last season. Not only did he miss 41 games last year, but his numbers were not to his standards when he was on the floor . Offseason additions Jeff Green and Austin Rivers will make the bench more potent (if not more inconsistent), and a bigger role for the efficient Porter would help. A glass-half-full Wizards observer might see the potential for a top-10 team on both ends of the floor. But finding a glass-half-full Wizards observer is difficult at this point in the team\u2019s history. The players on the current roster have played just a small role in the franchise\u2019s continuous futility, but Washington has the league\u2019s longest active streak of failing to win 50 games and its second-longest streak of *failing to reach the conference finals. Both streaks are 39 years long, dating back to consecutive trips to The Finals in 1978 and \u201979 . * The LA Clippers haven\u2019t reached the conference finals in the 48-year history of the franchise. Whether you consider all 39 years or just the last few, the Wizards should be hungry to prove themselves, not only against the league\u2019s best teams, but against the ones at the bottom of the standings too. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

But he hasn\u2019t relented on his desire to be traded from the Wolves even though nearly three weeks have passed since he made his intentions known. According to Jon Krawczynski and Shams Charania of The Athletic, Butler returned to Minnesota on Monday and met with Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau and said he still wants a trade. Butler had been away from the team while the Wolves were in California for a preseason bonding trip . Krawcynski reports Butler was still not in town when the team returned last week. Here\u2019s more from Krawczynski on Butler\u2019s meeting with Thibodeau : Days ago, reports of a nearly completed deal between the Wolves and Miami Heat emerged. However, proposed changes from Minnesota created a breakdown in negotiations just as the teams were close to finalizing the deal. The teams reportedly advanced to the point of exchanging player medical information, which is typically the last step of NBA trade negotiations. Except for this trade, the Timberwolves responded with an amendment to the framework of the deal, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , which caused the trade talks to \u201cfracture\u201d. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 59 games for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. Butler holds a player option on his contract next season, but it is widely expected he will opt out and join a 2019 free-agent market that many expect to be robust. Minnesota\u2019s All-Star big man, Karl-Anthony Towns, was entering the final year of his contract in 2018-19 as well. But he signed an extension with the Wolves shortly after training camp opened , securing his place in Minnesota for years to come. Reports circulated in the offseason that Butler was frustrated with the nonchalant attitudes of Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Next season, Wiggins will begin playing on his maximum contract in 2018-19, with a $25 million-plus salary that will account for more than 20 percent of the team\u2019s cap and push the Timberwolves close to the luxury tax threshold. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round.

Howard has been sidelined throughout the preseason with pain in his lower back, an injury that has forced the big man to be a spectator in each of the Wizards\u2019 practice and exhibition games to date. The Wizards beat the New York Knicks on the road last night, 110-98, but Howard was flown back to D.C. before the game for a pain-relieving injection in his back. On Tuesday afternoon, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported Howard saw a specialist while in New York who diagnosed him with a piriformis injury. Candace Buckner of The Washington Post reports Howard will stay in D.C. to rest and recover while the Wizards move on to visit the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. Buckner reports Howard woke up Sunday feeling soreness in his back after participating in a light workout with Washington\u2019s coaches. Here\u2019s more from Buckner on Howard\u2019s timetable for return: \u201cHe\u2019s going to get a pain-relieving injection and hopefully early next week, he\u2019ll be back on the court and be ready to play,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said . \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means for the first game, but we\u2019re just gonna take it day by day.\u201d The Wizards close out their preseason slate on Friday with a home game against the Guangzhou Long-Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association. After that, the Wizards have five days off before they host the Miami Heat in their season opener on Sept. 18. Buckner reports that before last night\u2019s game in New York, Brooks was asked if \u201cit was safe to say\u201d Howard won\u2019t play in the opener if he missed the preseason slate. Brooks\u2019 response? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s safe.\u201d Last season, Howard ranked third in the NBA in rebounds per game (12.5), fourth in double-doubles (53), ninth in blocks (1.6) and 11th in field-goal percentage (55.5 percent). Howard\u2019s most impressive game of the 2017-18 season came on March 21, when he finished with 32 points and a career-high 30 rebounds in a comeback win against the Nets. Howard was traded by the Hornets to the Nets in the offseason. Brooklyn waived him shortly thereafter, allowing Howard to sign with the Wizards. After spending the first eight seasons of his career with the Orlando Magic, Howard has played for the Los Angeles Lakers (2012-13), the Houston Rockets (2013-16), the Atlanta Hawks (2016-17) and the Hornets (2017-18) since then."},{"id":38332,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/steve-kerr-ejected-preseason-vs-suns","date":"2018-10-09","title":"Kerr argues with officials, gets ejected vs. Suns","content":"In the official play-by-play of last night\u2019s Suns-Warriors game in Golden State, the first recorded event is an offensive foul by former Kia MVP winner Stephen Curry. That play was apparently enough for Warriors coach Steve Kerr to sound off on the officials and get tossed for his outburst. Just nine seconds into the third quarter, the Warriors ran a play in which Curry set a screen on the Suns\u2019 Trevor Ariza while Kevin Durant cut backdoor. Ariza and Suns guard Shaquille Harrison got tangled up with Curry, who was called for the offensive foul. Curry then argued with officials about the call, netting a technical foul, which then caused Kerr to step onto the court and argue with the officials. Prior to that opening play of the third quarter, the Warriors had been whistled for five offensive fouls in their eventual 117-109 loss to the Suns. Official Ben Taylor then ejected Kerr, who per multiple media reports told game officials \u201c I don\u2019t want to be here anyway ,\u201d before waving goodbye and exiting the court. After the game, Kerr joked about his ejection, but also said he deserved it for his actions. \u201cWe had a good post-game spread,\u201d Kerr told reporters afterward . \u201cIt\u2019s usually out there by the late third quarter. I wanted to be the first one at the buffet. \u201cI was trying to make a point and back up my guys. We had all of these offensive fouls one after another. I finally had enough. \u2026 I was frustrated and was in the wrong, obviously. I got what I deserved.\u201d Connor Letourneau of the San Franciso Chronicle notes that after Kerr\u2019s ejection, the Warriors showed a little more spark and activity in the game. Curry told reporters after the game he appreciated Kerr sticking up for him and the team at large, writes Mark Medina of The Mercury News . \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together. We have to have each other\u2019s backs,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our core principles. He has opportunities to try to influence things with outbursts if he needs to and stuff he says in the locker room. Whatever the case is, knowing we\u2019re out there giving everything we got throughout the year, coach has your back. He\u2019s not pinching his wallet when he has the opportunity. When he speaks his mind, it means a lot.\u201d Additionally, it seemed the Warriors couldn\u2019t help but be somewhat entertained by Kerr\u2019s reaction to his ejection. \u201cIt was funny. I knew something was going to happen,\u201d Warriors guard Quinn Cook said. \u201cI remember seeing that on ESPN and seeing it on Instagram before I got here. It was my first time seeing it in person.

And then Murray\u2019s knee gave out. In an instant, the entire trajectory of the Spurs\u2019 season might have changed. Murray\u2019s season is almost certainly over, after the Spurs learned Monday that their starting point guard has a torn ACL in his right knee. The team hasn\u2019t revealed when Murray will have surgery, nor has it determined a timetable for his return, but ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation is a process that typically takes around a full year. \u201cYou just carry on,\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, standing in a corner of the team\u2019s practice facility in San Antonio shortly after the Murray diagnosis was released. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be out. Devastating injury for him, for the team. But life goes on. Everybody will pick up and do the best job we can to carry forward without him.\u201d Murray, who turned 22 last month, averaged 8.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists last season. \u201cI assume he misses the season,\u201d Popovich said. In a tweet, Murray thanked people for support and said he\u2019s \u201cbeen beating the odds and handling adversity\u201d throughout his life. Murray was a second-team member of the NBA\u2019s All-Defensive Team last season, the youngest player to ever earn such a distinction. He was also going to be the starter for a team that is chasing a 22nd consecutive postseason appearance, which would tie the NBA\u2019s record. Instead, the Spurs are likely going to have to choose between letting Derrick White take the starting gig or finding help elsewhere. \u201cWe were already confident in Derrick,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job for us and he was improving quickly, just like Dejounte had. Whether Dejounte was healthy or not, Derrick was going to play.\u201d Murray became the Spurs\u2019 starter last season, inheriting the role that Tony Parker held for the better part of two decades. Parker left the Spurs in the offseason, signing a two-year deal with the Charlotte Hornets \u2014 which means that the only person who started any games at the point last season and remains on the San Antonio roster is Patty Mills. \u201cIt\u2019s on us as leaders now, and me, to make sure we get everybody that\u2019s going to fill into Dejounte\u2019s shoes ready,\u201d Mills said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need them.\u201d It has been an absolutely brutal preseason for the Spurs, who were entering a transition year anyway now that the Big Three era is officially over and Kawhi Leonard was traded to Toronto. Tim Duncan retired two years ago, Parker left for Charlotte and Manu Ginobili decided over the summer to retire. And now on top of that, not only is Murray hurt but rookie guard Lonnie Walker IV will miss several weeks while recovering from a torn meniscus . Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said if a coach can figure out how to handle all this, it\u2019s Popovich. \u201cIf you have to be in one of those situations, you want to have a Hall of Fame mind like that to be able to figure something out,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cLeaguewide, I think everybody, staff and players, you cringe when you hear news like that. Very unfortunate.\u201d Popovich joked Monday that LaMarcus Aldridge will start, as will DeMar DeRozan, the All-Star guard acquired in the Leonard trade. Many other things, a week away from the regular season, are now unclear. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how we want to move forward, in a sense that nothing\u2019s in stone,\u201d Popovich said."},{"id":38328,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-eastern-conference-playoff-hopes","date":"2018-10-08","title":"Cavaliers face stiff competition for final East playoff spots","content":" Conventional wisdom and history would seem to be conspiring against the Cleveland Cavaliers in their hopes of maintaining any real sense of competitiveness in the Eastern Conference. When you have a roster built expressly for the talents of the NBA\u2019s best player, supporting cast to the league\u2019s brightest star, losing that guy is like pulling the center piece out in a game of Jenga. And if anyone had any doubts about that, look at what happened the last time James vamoosed. In 2010-11, the Cavaliers literally went topsy-turvy, from a 61-21 record the year before to a miserable 19-63. Sure, it earned them the most draft lottery chances and No. 1 pick Kyrie Irving, but the Cavs never got above water again until James mercifully returned four years later. Cleveland\u2019s gain was Miami\u2019s loss. The Heat won 17 fewer games without James in 2014-15, dropping from 54 victories to 37 and missing the postseason entirely. They\u2019ve been back twice since then, a testament to boss Pat Riley\u2019s ambitions, Erik Spoelstra\u2019s coaching staff and the roster\u2019s replenishment and resiliency. But until Miami lands another star, it appears maxed out as a contender. All of which is a way of suggesting that Cleveland this season \u2013 despite Tristan Thompson\u2019s bold talk and the commitment to refurbishing a Minnesota-style Kevin Love as cornerstone guy \u2013 faces a tough go. If that\u2019s how this plays out, with the Cavs sinking as a natural first step in their second post-LeBron era, some other team has a shot to rise from the Eastern Conference\u2019s depths. Here are the likeliest suspects (sorry, Brooklyn, Orlando and Atlanta):  Detroit has the onus of underachievement on its side. The Pistons took a big step forward two years ago, improving from 32 to 44 victories in what looked to be early progress in former coach\/POBO Stan Van Gundy\u2019s master plan. Two lottery finishes brought change, though, with Dwane Casey brought in as coach and Blake Griffin (acquired last season) getting established this fall as star flickering back on. Big man Andre Drummond extending his range, some strides by young help and, presumably, a healthier Reggie Jackson playing with his teammates in mind can get these guys back to late-April games.  If Charlotte is going to elbow into consideration for a low East seed, its season will have to be about more than guard Kemba Walker\u2019s future. The Hornets have promising pieces in search of a hole, and fresher air around them thanks to new coach James Borrego\u2019s arrival and Dwight Howard\u2019s departure. There\u2019s a lot riding on Cody Zeller in the middle, as well as Nicolas Batum\u2019s return and impact in versatility.  The signs of what Chicago can become, sooner rather than later, were revealed in the Bulls\u2019 solid play after their 3-20 start last season. They sort of scared themselves, actually, by nearly spoiling their draft-lottery plan. But their yield from 2017\u2019s Jimmy Butler trade \u2013 Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine \u2013 delivered real talent, and young bigs Bobby Portis and Wendell Carter Jr. look like keepers who just need time. Trying to win rather than lose should be good for a step up, too. The only legit way for New York to push into the battle for the No. 8 seed would be for the other competitors to lag, the Knicks\u2019 role players to overachieve and Kristaps Porzingis to hurry back sooner and better than most expect in his rehab from ACL surgery. New coach David Fizdale might be eager to make a Madison Square Garden splash and youngsters Frank Ntilikina and lottery pick Kevin Knox represent a good start. And then there is Cleveland, which has made noise that it won\u2019t easily relinquish one of the East\u2019s eight playoff berths. Rookie guard Collin Sexton has generated excitement already that he can update Irving\u2019s impact from eight years ago, and it will be nice to see Love unbound from his third-wheel role. The thing is, with aging vets who could appeal to serious contenders, it might be tempting for the Cavs come February to sell off parts rather than push for a quick first-round ouster. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

So there\u2019s somebody else that is going to win the East.\u201d Said new Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse: \u201cThe facts were there. For eight years, it was impossible. We thought it was possible \u2014 somehow, there\u2019s got to be a way, right? \u2014 but there wasn\u2019t.\u201d There is now. Some team other than James\u2019 will represent the East in The 2019 Finals. And you need a few years on you to recall the last time that happened. It was in 2010 , when the Boston Celtics eliminated James\u2019 Cavaliers in six games and sent the NBA\u2019s most celebrated player into his first round of free agency. That was the Paul Pierce-Kevin Garnett-Ray Allen Celtics, with Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Zydrunas Ilgauskas splitting time at center for the Cavs. \u201cYou think about it, I\u2019m the last coach to beat Golden State in the [pre-Finals West, in 2014] playoffs,\u201d the Clippers\u2019 Doc Rivers told NBA.com last month. \u201cBut this is crazier: I\u2019m the last coach to beat LeBron in the East. That is a long time ago. What it tells you is how dominant LeBron has been in the East.\u201d James notoriously took his talents to Miami that summer, and his Big Three dominated the East from 2011-14 . And when his self-described, four-year undergraduate education in winning was complete, James returned to the Cavaliers and packed the on-court success with him. That pushed his run of Finals appearances to eight (and nine overall, with titles in 2012, \u201813 and \u201816). His teams\u2019 W-L record in the East side of the playoffs over those eight years? A withering 96-27 (.797). Now that James has moved his game to southern California, though, the East is unleashed. Rivals that were frustrated by the big, beautiful wall James and his various teammates built between them and the NBA\u2019s championship round, and opponents who wound up cursing their parents\u2019 procreative timing, have gotten a happy reprieve. The Age of LeBron for them now means a couple of regular season meetings and nothing at all after that till, for one of them, June. \u201cIt is open,\u201d Rivers said, \u201cBut the top teams are still the top teams.\u201d The Celtics don\u2019t want the East to be open. They want a line of succession to hold, based on their near-miss last spring when Cleveland and its King wriggled free in Game 7 . That experience, along with gain from the pain of Gordon Hayward\u2019s (season-long) and Kyrie Irving\u2019s injuries, at least makes Boston the first among uncrowned equals in the conference. This squad defensive has the depth, the talent, the chops, a lot of youthful hunger and the most praised coach (Brad Stevens) in the league. Minutes might be hard to come by for some, which could test chemistry. But the Celtics got a boost there when Irving, a free agent next summer, essentially pledged his long-term loyalty to start October . Psychologically, none of the East contenders should feel as refreshed and revived as Toronto. Their Cleveland nemesis was a handful on the court, sure, but seemed to set up shop in the Raptors\u2019 heads as well. When they failed to pounce on Game 1 of their East semifinal series last spring \u2014 despite ranking as the conference\u2019s No. 1 seed and boasting tremendous depth and a variety of looks \u2014 the Raptors were for all intents done.  They fired their Coach of the Year winner, Dwane Casey , and promoted Nurse. They grabbed Spurs refugee Kawhi Leonard for what might be a one-year rental, the NBA\u2019s most likely LeBron stopper who won\u2019t have to worry now about that nasty duty. In the process, they broke up the tandem of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry that some felt had grown too comfy. If you believe Joel Embiid, the East already is locked up by Philadelphia, with the formidable and confident center vowing big things for his still-developing club. The Sixers have as much potential to improve from within as anybody in the league, given Embiid\u2019s potential, Ben Simmons\u2019 obvious room for growth as a shooter and the gap between Markelle Fultz as a Draft prospect vs. Fultz as a spun-around rookie. Philadelphia added shooting and Brett Brown coaches tenacious defense. There is some question whether Fultz or Dario Saric can be the reliable third option for these guys, and their biggest challenge remains durability. Embid, Simmons and Fultz need to play upwards of 210 games, combined, to give us a real sense of what the Sixers can be. The Pacers got more right last season than almost everyone expected, from the resiliency they showed in coping with Paul George\u2019s abrupt departure and the return GM Kevin Pritchard got from trading George to OKC, to impressive gains on the court at both ends and in the standings (a six-victory improvement). The trick now is repeating that and taking everything a few strides further. Victor Oladipo won\u2019t win a second consecutive Kia Most Improved Player award (no one has), but he can demonstrate his All-Star season was no adrenaline-fueled fluke. His partner from the Thunder trade, Domantas Sabonis, has the game and pedigree to get better every year. Big man Myles Turner marked time last season and needs a healthy, intense start-to-finish breakout season. Meanwhile, much of the excitement about Indiana comes from some surgical summer additions, with scorer Tyreke Evans, shooter Doug McDermott and strongman Kyle O\u2019Quinn plugging specific holes in the rotation. Rivers, in his recent swift assessment of the East, said \u201cthere\u2019s always a new team\u201d that bubbles to the surface over the course of 82 games. There are candidates in the East, with two of them owing that status to their significant offseason changes while a third soon may emerge as well. Milwaukee has Budenholzer and his staff in place, replacing the Jason Kidd\/Joe Prunty crew from 2017-18, with high hopes and early preseason signs of changes at both ends. The Bucks also have arguably the No. 1 player in the conference in Giannis Antetokounmpo, now that James is gone. Washington, a disappointment given John Wall\u2019s and Bradley Beal\u2019s early yet unfulfilled showings as a dynamic backcourt, added Dwight Howard. He ought to have enough game and pride left to satisfy the diminished individual expectations for him. Then there\u2019s Miami, a solid ensemble group that might end up coalescing around All-Star Jimmy Butler if the trade flirtations with Minnesota pan out. Without James blocking everybody\u2019s path this season, the newfound openness and evenness in the East \u2014 only three or four of last season\u2019s 15 All-NBA selections will play here this season, pending Butler\u2019s whereabouts \u2014 has everyone feeling perked up. \u201cThe Warriors have proven they\u2019re going to be the team to beat every year, the way they\u2019re constructed,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cBut the East has some really good teams. \u201cI think all the coaches and teams already were competitive anyway. Look, you wanted to knock LeBron off. But he\u2019s gotten a lot of coaches fired and a lot of players traded. Now it\u2019s definitely wide open.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Today, we look at the Detroit Pistons, who may have one more step to take defensively. The Pistons are one of two teams that have improved defensively in each of the last four seasons. In the 2013-14 season, the Pistons ranked 26th defensively , allowing 107.3 points per 100 possessions, 3.3 more than the league average. Then the Pistons hired Stan Van Gundy and, in regard to points allowed per 100 possessions vs. the league average, they improved in each of his four seasons as head coach. The Utah Jazz are the only other team that has done the same, improving defensively (vs. the league average) in each of Quin Snyder\u2019s four seasons on the bench. Last season, the Pistons actually registered the league\u2019s biggest drop in defensive rebounding percentage, grabbing 78.5 percent of available defensive boards ( 10th in the league ), down from 81.2 percent ( first ) in 2016-17. But they saw big improvements in both opponent turnover rate (from 23rd to eighth ) and opponent free throw rate (from ninth to third ) to more than make up for the rebounding drop-off. The Pistons moved up a few spots (from 19th to 16th) in opponent effective field goal percentage . And they did that despite seeing a big increase in the percentage of their opponent shots that came from the restricted area or 3-point range. In each of the previous two seasons (2015-16 and \u201916-17), Detroit was the best in the league at forcing their opponents to shoot from between the restricted area and 3-point range. League-wide over the last three seasons, restricted area shots (shot at 61 percent) have been worth 1.23 points per attempt, 3-pointers (36 percent) have been worth 1.07 points per attempt, and shots in between (40 percent) have been worth just 0.81 points per attempt. So if you\u2019re forcing the shots in between, you have the structure of a good defense. Last season, the Pistons took a step backward in that regard. In fact, no team saw a bigger increase in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from the restricted area or 3-point range. They went from 59 percent (lowest rate) in 2016-17 to 65 percent (14th lowest) last season. The much bigger jump came in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from beyond the arc, where they went from 31 percent (12th lowest rate) to 36 percent (fourth highest rate), which is interesting in regard to the Pistons\u2019 new coach. Last season, Dwane Casey\u2019s Toronto Raptors saw the biggest drop in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from 3-point range. After allowing their opponents to take 33 percent of their shots (the league\u2019s eighth highest rate) from beyond the arc in 2016-17, the Raptors allowed them to take only 29 percent of their shots (the league\u2019s second lowest rate) from 3-point range last season. And that\u2019s how Toronto saw defensive improvement (points allowed per 100 possessions vs. the league average) for the third straight season. Forcing opponent shots from the least efficient areas of the floor isn\u2019t everything in regard to defensive success. The Brooklyn Nets allowed the lowest percentage of opponent shots to come from the restricted area or 3-point range and ranked 25th defensively . And while Casey\u2019s Toronto defense was terrific against the league\u2019s not-so-great offenses, it had major issues against the top 10 teams on that end of the floor . The Pistons just need to get better. And while there\u2019s more room for improvement on offense, there\u2019s still another step forward they can take defensively. In Casey\u2019s first season in Toronto, the Raptors allowed 8.5 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did the season prior. That is the fifth biggest improvement in defensive efficiency of the last 40 years. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

All I wanted the Morning Tip to do was summarize the week that was in the NBA, the way Peter so expertly did in the NFL, perhaps make a few predictions, answer a few of your questions, and maybe tell you something you didn\u2019t know about the league and the people in it. I didn\u2019t know if a lot of people would read it. I didn\u2019t know if it would have any impact. I didn\u2019t know how long I would do it, or be asked to do it. Almost a decade later, I have my answer. Basketball, I was told long ago, is a culture. And the Morning Tip is a labor of love, a weekly electronic gathering for people who, like me, love the NBA and everyone in it. We let anyone in \u2014 men, women, black, white, Latino, Asian, South American, straight, gay, rich, poor, famous, infamous, weekend warrior, never played past high school, LeBron James \u2014 if you love the orange leather. The game, and the people in the game, are what gives the NBA its singular, intimate relationship between those inside the paint and those watching outside. I\u2019ve tried to chronicle that relationship over the last decade. Today is the last time. This is the last Morning Tip. From me, anyway. And Tuesday is my last day at Turner Sports, my work home since 2004. I leave not because I was unhappy with Turner, or because Turner was unhappy with me. It\u2019s just a time in my life when I need to pull back from the endless grind of travel, and be at home more, with my wife and kids. To cover the NBA as well as you can, you need to fly. A lot. And after 30 years of being on planes, I\u2019m a little tired, like Forrest Gump after he had been running for two years. My first road trip covering the NBA came on Election Night of 1988 \u2014 Nov. 8. It was, relatively, an easy trip, a quick jaunt up to New Jersey to watch the then-Washington Bullets play the then-New Jersey Nets . The fact that there\u2019s so many \u201cthens\u201d in the previous sentence kind of proves my point. When I started flying for a living, I sat in the very back of planes \u2014 which was where the smoking sections still were. (You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve had a steady diet of menthol in 27E for two years.) I flew PanAm and TWA and USAir, took the Delta Shuttle up to New York. The few cell phones in use all looked like this and I didn\u2019t know anybody who actually had one \u2014 they were the province of those then known as The Rich and Famous (who had their own show, dedicated to them ).  The year before, I had written my senior thesis in history in college in our university\u2019s one computer lab, three hours at a time \u2014 three hours being the maximum amount of time you could spend at a computer at one time \u2014 and saved my thesis on floppy disks . Women on TV wore shoulder pads bigger than Walter Payton\u2019s . It was a while ago, y\u2019all. And during those three decades , I\u2019ve seen so very, very much that I will never forget: Jordan\u2019s sleight of hand and \u201c The Shrug \u201d, the Pistons\u2019 amazing team defense in 1990 and the Pistons\u2019 amazing team defense in 2004 \u2014 both NBA championship squads. I won\u2019t forget Magic at the All-Star Game in 1992 , after he\u2019d retired from the NBA because he had tested HIV positive, back in the days when we thought that was an automatic death sentence. And I won\u2019t forget him and the Dream Team in Barcelona at the 1992 Olympics , providing in their dominance of the rest of the world a challenge to the rest of the world to get better at basketball. Which it did. I won\u2019t forget Allen Iverson almost single-handedly taking the 76ers to The Finals in his MVP season in 2001, nor what Shaq did to Dikembe Mutombo, the NBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year that season, in those Finals . I was at LeBron\u2019s first game , and Kobe\u2019s last game . I was as surprised as anyone when Tim Duncan told me his Spurs would beat the Heat in the upcoming Finals rematch in 2014. I saw\u2026  Oh, for God\u2019s sake, David. You\u2019re not dead yet. You\u2019re just changing jobs. You\u2019re going to see more cool stuff. True. But, I will miss Turner, immensely. The people at TNT, NBA TV and NBA.com have been my work family the last 14 years. The ride has been magical. I mostly, obviously, covered the NBA during those years. But I also got to cover the late Roy Halladay\u2019s no-hitter for the Phillies against the Reds in Game 1 of the 2010 Division Series . (I\u2019ve never watched my postgame interview with him. I felt so inadequate at that moment, knowing the historical significance of what Doc Halladay had done \u2014 just the second postseason no-hitter in the history of the game, and the first since Don Larsen\u2019s perfect game for the Yankees against Brooklyn in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. And in the moment, I thought my questions \u2014 any questions, I guess \u2014 didn\u2019t match up to what he did.) I got to see Jayson Werth\u2019s ninth-inning homer in Game 4 of the 2012 Division Series against St. Louis save the Washington Nationals\u2019 season \u2014 and I got to see the Cardinals\u2019 epic comeback from a 6-0 defcit the following night to snatch the series away from a stunned Washington crowd. I got to cover March Madness and college football. But, mainly, I got to work with the best group you could possibly ask to spend weeks out of your life, away from your real family. They excelled at their jobs, but were even better people. I\u2019m going to forget people, I know, and I apologize in advance to those who belong here, Chalk it up to a hundred Last Calls and being a Gen Xer. But, thank you: David Levy. Lenny Daniels.

You are a friend, and always will be. I hope you see now that the TV side was its own community. The Tip was the digital version of that community \u2014 people that loved the NBA and wanted to take a long, deep dive into what was happening on and off the floor. And that involved interaction with fans as well. During the last decade I\u2019ve gotten e-mail from every continent save Antarctica (what\u2019s up with that, Ant?), and 95 percent of the correspondence has been either genuinely constructive or complimentary. When I made factual errors \u2014 geography being a particular shortcoming, which drove my old social studies teachers to drink, early and often \u2014 your corrections were almost always good-natured. My quest was to connect you not only with the game\u2019s superstars, but with the guys at the end of the bench, with the announcers, with the cities and the arena \u2014 what it was like to be there, from every angle, and what it was like to put a team together, or have to take it apart, and how you went about doing it. You saw what rebuilding was really like in Philadelphia , what losing a team was like for Seattle\u2019s loyal fans , what ending a 52-year championship drought meant to people in Cleveland , a city that, like so many others, wrestled with where sports fit in the grand scheme of things. You were in the room with guys who interviewed to be head coaches , and there when the Clippers, improbably, were able to beat the Lakers to Chris Paul . We went to London and Rio for the Olympics .  We did Q&As with everybody: Stephen Curry , Joel Embiid , Larry Bird , Dirk Nowitzki and others. We had guest Tippers when I was on vacation. And I heard from you, every week. The Mailbag was a two-way street, where you could give your opinions, trade ideas and feedback on what was in the previous Tip. You were very kind in your praise. And, we disagreed about a lot. But it was almost always civil. I especially learned much for our discussions about issues of race and gender. I could not in good conscience ignore what has happened around me and us the last decade. I did not stick to sports. And we had very respectful discussions about guns and the Second Amendment and police brutality. Sometimes, we agreed to disagree. Only a handful of times did someone \u2014 a person I\u2019m sure did not really care all that much about basketball \u2014 cross a line. It was not easy to put the Tip together. It was not easy working 48 weekends out of 52 every year, writing until 3 or 4 a.m. many weeks, to make sure that the absolute latest info was there. It was not easy checking, and re-checking, and triple-checking all the numbers and suppositions, rumors and quotes that went into every Tip. But it was my absolute pleasure. Until we meet again. * * * The views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting."},{"id":38358,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-atlanta-hawks-defense","date":"2018-10-08","title":"One Team One Stat: Atlanta Hawks go from top 10 to bottom 10 on defense","content":" NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann gets you ready for the 2018-19 season with a key stat for each team in the league and shows you why it matters. Today, we look at the Atlanta Hawks, who took a big step backward defensively. The Hawks allowed 108.2 points per 100 possessions last season (21st in the league), up from 103.1 the season prior (fourth). That was the league\u2019s biggest increase in defensive efficiency last season. After three straight seasons of ranking in the top seven defensively (with the Eastern Conference\u2019s third best record over that stretch), the Hawks fell into the bottom 10. The Hawks saw the league\u2019s second biggest increase in opponent effective field goal percentage, from 50.7 percent ( eighth in the league ) in 2016-17 to 53.6 percent ( 25th ) last season. They were also one of just three teams that saw an increase in opponent free throw rate . The Hawks saw drop-offs in both their ability to protect the rim and their ability to defend the 3-point line. They went from fifth (57.9 percent) to 15th (63.0 percent) in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area, also seeing an increase in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from there. That resulted in Atlanta opponents scoring almost four more points per game in the restricted area last season ( 32.7 ) than they did in \u201916-17 ( 28.8 ). Atlanta also saw the league\u2019s third biggest increase in opponent 3-point percentage, from 35.7 percent ( 16th ) to 37.7 percent ( 28th ). The restricted area and the 3-point line are the two most important areas of the floor, and if you don\u2019t defend them well, well\u2026 In theory, you can be a good defensive team without a lot of talent. Defense is about size and length, energy and effort. And we have seen lesser-talented teams make the most of what they have by playing good defense. In Brett Brown\u2019s second season in Philadelphia, with new Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce as an assistant, the Sixers ranked 13th defensively (and were actually in the top 10 through March ). Philly\u2019s leading scorers that season were Tony Wroten and Michael Carter-Williams (who combined to miss 93 games). But it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that the three teams that fell from the top 10 to the bottom 10 on defense last season were teams that lost great players (Paul Millsap, Jimmy Butler and Mike Conley) via trade or injury. In Kent Bazemore, Taurean Prince, John Collins and Dewayne Dedmon, the Hawks have the makings of a good defensive unit. Trae Young may be only 6-foot-2, but he probably can\u2019t be worse defensively than Dennis Schroder was last season. The Hawks allowed 112.3 points per 100 possessions in 786 minutes with both Schroder and Collins on the floor last season, but just 103.1 in 999 minutes with Collins on the floor without Schroder. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

They have a future. No two franchises have met more often in the NBA playoffs than the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, who have faced each other 20 times in postseason history (seven when the Sixers were the Syracuse Nationals). It\u2019s a rivalry that has featured Hal Greer vs. Sam Jones, Wilt Chamberlain vs. Bill Russell, and Julius Erving vs. Larry Bird. It has featured seven decisive Game 7s, \u201cHavlicek stole the ball!\u201d , \u201cBeat L.A.!\u201d , and \u201cThe Boston Strangler.\u201d And now, we may have just entered a stretch like what we saw in the early \u201980s, when the Celtics and Sixers met in the Eastern Conference finals four times in six years (1980, \u201981, \u201982, and \u201985). Five months ago, the Celtics eliminated the Sixers in five games in the East semis. With LeBron James now in the Western Conference, these teams each have the opportunity to rule the East for years to come, and they\u2019re standing in each other\u2019s way. The Celtics are one of the three franchises \u2014 the Knicks and Warriors are the others \u2014 remaining from the Basketball Association of America, founded in 1946 . The Syracuse Nationals started in the National Basketball League in \u201946 and joined the NBA in 1949. Boston and Syracuse would first meet in the postseason in 1953, with Bob Cousy\u2019s Celtics ousting Dolph Schayes\u2019 Nats in the Eastern Division semifinals. That would begin a nine-year stretch in which the two teams would meet in the playoffs seven times, highlighted by a seven-game series in the 1959 division finals, with the Celtics winning Game 7, 130-125 . Boston won four of the seven series the two teams played before the Nats moved to Philadelphia in 1963 and became the 76ers. Philly added Chamberlain a year later and he would go head-to-head with Russell in the next four Division finals (1965-68), with the Celtics winning three of the four times, including seven-game series in \u201965 (with John Havlicek\u2019s famous steal sealing the Game 7 victory) and \u201968. The rivalry hit another peak in the early 80s, when either Boston or Philadelphia represented the East in The Finals for eight straight years (1980-87), with talent like Erving and Bird, Moses Malone and Robert Parish, Maurice Cheeks and Dennis Johnson, Bobby Jones and Kevin McHale. With last year\u2019s victory in the conference semifinals, the Celtics are 13-7 in playoff series all-time vs. Syracuse\/Philadelphia, with a 9-4 edge against the Sixers since the \u201963 move. Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bird rank first, second and fourth in all-time playoff scoring (total points) vs. the Nats\/Sixers, while Chamberlain, Greer and Julius Erving rank third, fifth and sixth vs. Boston. These are two of the best three teams in the Eastern Conference, with the league\u2019s GMs placing them first and third . The Celtics beat the Sixers in a five-game series in May, slowing down a Philly offense that had been on an eight-week tear and out-executing the Sixers in three games that were within five points in the last five minutes . And Boston did it without Gordon Hayward or Kyrie Irving. Kia Rookie of the Year winner Ben Simmons had a rough series, Joel Embiid was outplayed by Al Horford and Jayson Tatum blossomed into a star. Boston had the league\u2019s best defense last season and is adding Hayward to an offense that ranked 18th and will also get a boost from the development of the young core of Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier. Philly ranked third offensively in March and April , but lost a couple of key offensive cogs \u2014 Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova \u2014 in the offseason. The Sixers ranked third defensively and with a huge starting lineup, were the best rebounding team in the league . In Boston, the biggest variable this season will be chemistry. Defensively, the Celtics should once again be in the top five and how well the pieces all fit together on offense will determine their ceiling. Hayward has yet to really play with this group and Irving has yet to run an offense that includes the Tatum and Brown that we saw in the playoffs. The Celtics have the right coach to make it all work, but some egos will have to be kept in check over the next nine months. For the Sixers, it\u2019s all about Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick of the 2017 Draft who played in just 14 regular season games and didn\u2019t play in the conference semis. Fultz adds a new element to the Philly offense and will be given the chance to start alongside Simmons, even if it means breaking up what was the best starting lineup in the league last season . As skilled as Fultz is at getting to the hoop, all eyes will be on how willing and comfortable he is in shooting from beyond 15 feet. He should be plenty motivated otherwise, but the trade these teams made just before the \u201917 Draft just adds more intrigue to this rivalry. The Celtics traded out of the No. 1 spot, picked up an extra pick in the deal, selected Tatum at No. 3, and saw him have a spectacular rookie season \u2014 all while Fultz dealt with his shooting issues. The development of all the other young players on these rosters is another variable. While the Celtics have more weapons, both Simmons and Embiid have the potential to be players that no team can match up with. Boston found ways to slow them down in the playoffs, but both are sure to come back stronger and more skilled. Not only do the Celtics and Sixers have some of the best young talent already on their rosters, but even if they\u2019re two of the best teams in the league, they each have potential Lottery picks in their pocket. The Celtics are owed first round picks from the Sacramento Kings (the extra pick in the Fultz-Tatum trade, top-one protected) and the Memphis Grizzlies (top-eight protected) in next year\u2019s Draft. The Sixers, meanwhile, will get the Miami Heat\u2019s first round pick in 2021. Philadelphia has the cap space to add a big contract next summer. Boston, for five years running now, has the assets to pull off a trade for any star that may come on the market. The Celtics may lose some of their backcourt depth with Terry Rozier\u2019s free agency next summer, but almost all of the Celtics\u2019 young talent is on the perimeter and at some point, they\u2019ll need to replace Horford (32) and Aron Baynes (32 in December) on the frontline. For now, Horford is arguably the most valuable player on either team. The future is now and appropriately, these teams will open the NBA season in Boston on Oct. 16 ( 8 p.m. ET, TNT ). * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

The teams reportedly advanced to the point of exchanging player medical information, which is typically the last step of NBA trade negotiations. Except for this trade, the Timberwolves responded with an amendment to the framework of the deal, according to Wojnarowski, which caused the trade talks to \u201cfracture\u201d. Here\u2019s more from ESPN on what reportedly caused the deal to break down: The Heat enter 2018-19 with a nearly identical roster as last season, when they went 44-38 to secure the No. 6 seed. The addition of Butler could be enough to vault Miami into the top half of the Eastern Conference. > Morning Tip: What\u2019s Next Move For Minnesota? Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 59 games for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. Butler holds a player option on his contract next season, but it is widely expected he will opt out and join a 2019 free-agent market that many expect to be robust. Minnesota\u2019s All-Star big man, Karl-Anthony Towns, was entering the final year of his contract in 2018-19 as well. But he signed an extension with the Wolves shortly after training camp opened , securing his place in Minnesota for years to come. Reports circulated in the offseason that Butler was frustrated with the nonchalant attitudes of Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Next season, Wiggins will begin playing on his maximum contract in 2018-19, with a $25 million-plus salary that will account for more than 20 percent of the team\u2019s cap and push the Timberwolves close to the luxury tax threshold. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round.

Today, we look at the Chicago Bulls, who added some movement to their offense. The Bulls led the league in player movement, averaging 11.6 miles traveled (from five offensive players) per 24 minutes of possession, according to Second Spectrum tracking. The Bulls were one of three teams \u2013 Golden State and Philadelphia were the others \u2013 that ranked in the top five in both player movement and ball movement (passes per 24 minutes of possession). It was the Bulls\u2019 third season under head coach Fred Hoiberg, but maybe the first in which we really saw his vision of a free-flowing offense. They saw the league\u2019s biggest increase in player movement and its second biggest increase in ball movement from the season prior. Of course, last season was also the Bulls\u2019 worst offensive season in 14 years. They ranked 28th in offensive efficiency , scoring 4.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average. Talent trumps everything else in this league and while a lot of teams can emulate the Warriors in regard to style, none can match the champs in regard to personnel. The Bulls\u2019 four leading scorers from the 2016-17 season all left between the 2017 and 2018 trade deadlines. Last season, they were one of three teams \u2013 Memphis and Phoenix were the others \u2013 that ranked in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (52.2 percent \u2013 27th), mid-range field goal percentage (37.9 percent \u2013 26th ) and 3-point percentage (35.5 percent \u2013 21st ). Player and ball movement don\u2019t matter much if you don\u2019t make the shots they produce. The Bulls did get a 19-points-per-game scorer in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to Minnesota, but Zach LaVine was recovering from an ACL tear and didn\u2019t play until mid-January last season. The Bulls were better offensively in the 24 games LaVine played (104.2 points scored per 100 possessions) than they did in the 58 games he missed (100.0). But in those 24 games, they were better offensively with LaVine off the floor (107.5) than they were with him on the floor (101.6). LaVine wasn\u2019t fully recovered from the ACL surgery. He shot a career-low 38 percent and, after playing those 24 games, missed the final 14 games of the season. So we shouldn\u2019t draw any strong conclusions about how well the Bulls played with LaVine. It might be worth noting, however, that there was less player and ball movement in the games that LaVine played. (It wasn\u2019t a huge drop, though.) The Bulls added to their talent with the addition of Jabari Parker, who ranked 11th of 12 Milwaukee Bucks rotation players (at least 15 minutes per game in 20 or more games) in assist ratio , recording assists on just 13 percent of his possessions. When the season starts, both LaVine and Parker will both be 20 months removed from their ACL tears. And we\u2019ll see if they keep the ball and the bodies moving. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Portland Trail Blazers, who shoot off the dribble too much. The Blazers were the only team that recorded assists on less than half of their field goals last season. The Blazers also ranked in the bottom five in both ball movement (295 passes per 24 minutes of possession \u2013 29th in the league) and player movement (10.2 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession \u2013 26th), according to Second Spectrum tracking. There\u2019s no correlation between ball or player movement and offensive efficiency . In fact, five of the top eight teams in ball movement ranked in the bottom 10 in points scored per 100 possessions. The only team that threw fewer passes per 24 minutes of possession than the Blazers was the Houston Rockets, who ranked second offensively. Two other top five offenses \u2013 Cleveland and Minnesota \u2013 ranked in the bottom five in ball movement. But the Blazers\u2019 guard-heavy offense doesn\u2019t get them the best kinds of shots. Last season, only 46 percent of their jump shots, the league\u2019s lowest rate, were off the catch. They ranked third in pull-up effective field goal percentage (45.9 percent) and 19th in catch-and-shoot effective field goal percentage (52.0 percent), but still scored about seven more points per 100 shots on the catch-and-shoot jumpers. The Blazers led the league with 26.8 pull-up jumpers per game , with C.J. McCollum (9.3) and Damian Lillard (8.9) ranking fourth and sixth amongst individuals . The pair ranked 10th and sixth in pull-up effective field goal percentage among the 37 players who attempted at least five per game. There\u2019s clear value to having guards who can shoot off the dribble and force opposing big men to venture farther from the basket than they\u2019d prefer. But both Lillard and McCollum shot more effectively on catch-and-shoot jumpers , and some of their teammates did too. Catch-and-shoot jumpers are much more likely to be 3-point shots. League-wide last season, 81 percent of catch-and-shoot jumpers and only 34 percent of pull-up jumpers were from beyond the arc. Three is greater than two and a catch-and-shoot 3-point attempt is worth much more (1.12 points per attempt) than a pull-up two (0.80). The talent of Lillard and McCollum make up some of that difference, but not all of it. The Blazers had a top-five offense in 2013-14 and they remained in the top 10 for two more seasons, including their first ( \u201915-16 ) without LaMarcus Aldridge. They\u2019ve been running one of the more unique offenses in the league, accentuating the skills of their two guards. But they\u2019ve slipped (in points scored per 100 possessions vs. the league average) in each of the last four seasons. And it may be time for some new wrinkles that generate more shots off the catch. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts.

After last night\u2019s 128-123 preseason win against the Sacramento Kings, James couldn\u2019t help but praise the performance of Ingram. The third-year forward finished with 31 points (on 10-for-15 shooting), 10 rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block. That type of varied performance \u2014 one that also included an 11-for-15 mark from the free-throw line \u2014 provides the Lakers with the kind of secondary offensive option the team needs this season. \u201cI thought [Ingram] was great,\u201d said James, who finished with 18 points and four assists in 16 minutes last night. \u201cHis pace, his ability to play the point and play the wing, he\u2019s a very special talent, and we\u2019re definitely happy to have him on our side. \u201cI know what I see in him, and he\u2019s looking for this opportunity to make this next jump in his third year. So, it\u2019s a lot of upside in that kid, and I\u2019m happy to try to give him as much as I can.\u201d With the game on the line, Ingram delighted the Lakers\u2019 bench and Lakers fans with his defense against the Kings\u2019 Cameron Reynolds on an inbounds pass. Ingram took on some of the Lakers\u2019 playmaking duties last season, logging 10 starts at point guard in January while Ball was out with injury. He took on that role on Thursday (veteran Rajon Rondo got the night off and Ball continues to recover from knee surgery) and came up with key plays down the stretch to help L.A. to victory.  Half of his 10 made field goals came on drives, while he also scored off mid-range pull-ups and had 12 points in the game\u2019s final eight minutes. \u201cHe\u2019s a great kid. He works hard \u2014 extremely hard \u2014 and he has a lot of talent,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd he believes in his ability, so we\u2019ll see what the next jump is, but, I mean, none of us are prophets. We don\u2019t know.\u201d Playing alongside James, even through these first two preseason games, has caused life to be markedly different for Ingram on the court. And James\u2019 praise only drives Ingram to want to do more. \u201cHe takes so much [defensive] attention,\u201d Ingram said of James. \u201cI\u2019ve been way more efficient with scoring. And then it gives me more energy on the defensive end \u2014 just to guard my guy, get in the passing lane and try to start our offense on the defensive end. \u201cIt makes you want to keep going. I don\u2019t think I want to stop here. My expectations are way higher than anyone\u2019s expectations in this room or anybody, so for him to say that is an extreme compliment, because, of course, he\u2019s my teammate, and I\u2019ve got to have his back at all times.\u201d"},{"id":38382,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-denver-nuggets-3-point-defense","date":"2018-10-05","title":"One Team One Stat: Nuggets (again) struggle to defend 3-point line","content":" NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann gets you ready for the 2018-19 season with a key stat for each team in the league and shows you why it matters. Today, we look at the Denver Nuggets, who struggled to defend the 3-point line for a third straight season. The Nuggets ranked last in opponent 3-point percentage , allowing their opponents to shoot 37.8 percent from beyond the arc. The league is taking more 3-pointers every year. It has set a record for 3-point attempts in each of the last six seasons, with more than 22,000 more attempts last season (71,340) than it had five seasons prior (49,067 in 2012-13). The bottom 11 teams in opponent 3-point percentage last season were all below-average defensive teams. The Nuggets ranked 26th defensively , in the bottom 10 for the fifth straight season (the Sacramento Kings is the only other team in that club). The addition of Paul Millsap (who was on a top-10 defense in each of his last three seasons in Atlanta) was supposed to get the Nuggets out of the bottom 10. But a wrist injury sidelined Millsap for a 44-game stretch in the middle of the season and the defense wasn\u2019t much better in the 38 games he played (108.4 points allowed per 100 possessions) than it was in the games he missed (109.2). Nuggets\u2019 opponents shot well from 3-point range in games which Millsap missed (37.0 percent) and in games in which he played (38.6 percent), with him on the floor (37.5 percent) and with him off the floor (40.5 percent). None of those marks would have ranked better than 24th in opponent 3-point percentage. Their problems started in transition. Nuggets opponents shot 43.1 percent from 3-point range in the first six seconds of the shot clock, the highest opponent mark for any portion of the clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Nuggets ranked 15th in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 possessions that were in transition (14.8 percent), but 30th in opponent effective field goal percentage in transition (63.8 percent), and 29th in points allowed per possession in transition (1.15). Transition issues can be addressed with better habits. In half-court situations, the Nuggets have to do a better job of protecting the corners. They allowed their opponents to take 26 percent of their 3-point attempts, the highest opponent rate in the league, from the corners. Nuggets opponents didn\u2019t have as big a discrepancy, but league-wide 3-point percentage was 39.3 percent from the corners and 35.6 percent from elsewhere around the arc. Last season wasn\u2019t the first in which the Nuggets had trouble defending the 3-point line. They\u2019ve ranked in the bottom five in opponent 3-point percentage in each of coach Mike Malone\u2019s three seasons on the bench. The Nuggets have a ton of offensive talent. They ranked sixth offensively last season, their three leading scorers are just 23, 24 and 21 years old, and they added Isaiah Thomas in the summer. But if they\u2019re going to end their five-year playoff drought and maybe fulfill their potential as a top-five team in the Western Conference, they will need to improve defensively, especially at the 3-point line. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

It\u2019s just evolving. For offenses these days, having fewer than four shooters on the floor is less than ideal. In the last few seasons, traditional centers \u2014 players like DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez \u2014 are stepping out beyond the arc and shoot 3-pointers. Teams have learned that post-ups are inefficient, but there\u2019s still value in other traditional big man skills. The most valuable shots on the floor remain layups and dunks, so there is a place in the game for players like Rudy Gobert and Clint Capela. Neither of those players can shoot, but they can finish at the rim on one end of the floor and protect the rim on the other. With that in mind, here\u2019s a look at the top three big men in each division. And with five of the top seven picks of this year\u2019s Draft being power forwards and center, we must make note of the next generation. Note: For this list, we\u2019re looking at guys that all play at least some of their minutes at center and don\u2019t play any minutes at small forward. Apologies to players like Aaron Gordon, who is best fit at the four, who played most of his minutes there last season and who would have been in the top three in his division. Home to the Eastern Conference\u2019s three best teams, the Atlantic boasts many versatile players and three of the East\u2019s best bigs.  1. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers He\u2019s huge, he\u2019s skilled, and he\u2019s been playing basketball for less than 10 years. A healthy Embiid will be a perennial Kia MVP and Kia Defensive Player of the Year candidate. 2. Al Horford, Boston Celtics Horford\u2019s numbers don\u2019t stand out, but he is the fulcrum on both ends of the floor for the best team in the East. He also outplayed Embiid in a playoff series just five months ago. 3. Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks Porzingis is on the shelf, recovering from a torn ACL suffered in February . When he returns, the 23-year-old needs to improve his playmaking and shot selection, but he\u2019s incredibly valuable (and unique) in that he both can shoot from deep and protect the rim. The future Jarrett Allen, Brooklyn Nets: The 20-year-old needs to get stronger and learn how to anchor a defense, but his skills around the basket developed quickly in his rookie season. This may be the deepest division regarding useful bigs, with Indiana\u2019s Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis both 22 years old and both having the potential to climb into the top three in the next year.  1. Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers He can shoot, pass and clean the glass. And after four years of playing alongside LeBron James as a shooter, Love will again have the offense run through him . 2. Blake Griffin, Detroit Pistons Griffin is super-skilled and has taken his game beyond the arc over the last two seasons , but his ideal frontline complement is a player more like Porzingis (hard to find) and less like Andre Drummond or DeAndre Jordan. 3. Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons Drummond took steps forward regarding his passing and free throw shooting last season. He\u2019s still not the defender that he has the potential to be and the fit with Griffin remains a big question. The future Lauri Markkanen & Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls: With skills inside and out, the Bulls\u2019 last two Lottery picks could complement each other on the team\u2019s frontline of the future. This is clearly the weakest division regarding true big men, though there are some promising bigs on the horizon.  1. Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets: He has missed 69 games over the last two seasons, but he was valuable as a starter (and a high-volume, energetic screen-setter) two seasons ago and will return to that role with the departure of \u2026 2. Dwight Howard, Washington Wizards: Still an effective defender regarding both deterring and defending shots near the basket. It\u2019s a question if he can be just do the dirty work on offense with consistency and without complaint. 3. Nikola Vucevic, Orlando Magic: He is skilled and has improved as a defender, but he still doesn\u2019t get to the line enough. He may need to take a step backward in the final season of his contract to allow the young frontline of Gordon, Jonathan Isaac and rookie Mo Bamba to develop. The future Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat & John Collins, Atlanta Hawks: Both 21, they showed potential as rookies. Collins has more bounce, while Adebayo may be the more complete player. This division clearly has the league\u2019s best collection of starting centers, with Oklahoma City\u2019s Steven Adams and Portland\u2019s Jusuf Nurkic joining the three below.  1. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz: The next two guys are much more skilled offensively, but the impact that Gobert makes on defense is tremendous, and he\u2019s no liability on offense either. 2. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves: Towns is one of the league\u2019s best finishers in the paint, one of its best mid-range shooters, and one of its best 3-point shooters (not just among bigs). The lack of consistent energy and effort on defense remains an issue. 3. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets: You could arguably put these three in any order. Jokic is the ridiculously skilled fulcrum of a top-six offense and maybe the best passing big man we\u2019ve ever seen. He (and his team) could benefit from him being a little more aggressive \u2026 and a lot better on the defensive end of the floor. The future Zach Collins, Portland Trail Blazers: The Northwest is a little light on talented, young bigs, but Collins shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. The No. 10 pick in the 2017 Draft (who\u2019s just 20 years old) is about to step into a bigger role on a team built to win now. The Pacific is the home of the champs and the most versatile big man in the league, but also home to two teams trying to climb out of the Western Conference basement on the shoulders of the top two picks in the 2018 Draft .  1. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors: He\u2019d be No. 1 on this list even if his new teammate was healthy. When locked in, he\u2019s the league\u2019s best and most versatile defender. He can\u2019t shoot, but he\u2019s one of the best passing bigs in the game. 2. DeMarcus Cousins, Golden State Warriors: It remains to be seen what Cousins will have lost with the Achilles tear he suffered in January . But he has taken steps forward as both a shooter and a playmaker, and his new team should make him a better defender. 3. Marcin Gortat, LA Clippers: Gortat isn\u2019t the finisher that DeAndre Jordan is (not by a mile, really), but his skills as a screen-setter will help the league\u2019s deepest group of guards. The future DeAndre Ayton, Phoenix Suns & Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings: The top two picks of the 2018 Draft, two of the more skilled big men we\u2019ve seen enter the league in the last 10 years, will be going head-to-head in the Pacific Division for years to come. This division\u2019s top three bigs are a contrast in styles, but all three have made big impacts on playoff teams.  1. Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans: This guy is so good, the league\u2019s GMs voted him as the league\u2019s best power forward and the best center . Davis took things to another level after Cousins\u2019 injury last season and will need to maintain that level to get the Pelicans back to the playoffs. 2. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs: The NBA\u2019s post-up and mid-range king , Aldridge has adjusted his shot selection a bit and is coming off the most efficient scoring season (true shooting percentage of 57.0 percent) of his career. 3. Clint Capela, Houston Rockets: He certainly benefits from playing alongside James Harden and Chris Paul, but they also benefit from his skills as a roll man and his ability to switch onto guards defensively. The future Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies: Jackson may look like more of a \u201ctrue big\u201d on defense, where he has shown the ability to protect the rim, than on offense, where he has shown the ability to step outside and make 3-pointers. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Today, we look at the Indiana Pacers, who weren\u2019t very good when their best player wasn\u2019t on the floor. The Pacers outscored their opponents by 6.4 points per 100 possessions with Oladipo on the floor, and were outscored by 7.3 with him off the floor . That (13.7 points per 100 possessions) was the second biggest on-off NetRtg differential among 266 players who played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team. With Oladipo on the floor, the Pacers had the point differential of a 60-22 team. With Oladipo off the floor, they had the point differential of a 19-63 team. There\u2019s obviously some drop-off when a team\u2019s best player steps off the floor, but in general, when he\u2019s off the floor, so are the opponents\u2019 best players. When it\u2019s bench vs. bench, offensive numbers are usually down. But when Oladipo sat, the Pacers\u2019 defensive numbers suffered more. They allowed 102.9 points per 100 possessions (a rate which would have ranked fifth in the league) with Oladipo on the floor and 110.6 (a rate which would have ranked 30th) with him off the floor. On-off numbers require context, like who\u2019s on the floor with the player and who\u2019s on the floor when he isn\u2019t. Oladipo played most of his minutes with the Pacers\u2019 other starters, but he was clearly the biggest difference-maker. The team\u2019s next best on-off differential ( 8.2 points per 100 possessions ) belonged to Thaddeus Young, who, not coincidentally, was the teammate that Oladipo shared the floor with most . On the other end of the spectrum was Lance Stephenson, the guy who was on the floor for 86 percent of the minutes that Oladipo was off the floor. In 1,198 minutes with Stephenson on the floor without Oladipo, the Pacers were outscored by 7.5 points per 100 possessions (allowing 111.5) . In the playoffs, the Pacers outscored the Cleveland Cavaliers by 40 points over seven games. It was the best point differential for a team that lost a series in the 16 years of the current (best-of-seven first round) playoff format. Indiana\u2019s three wins were by a total of 54 points, while Cleveland\u2019s four wins were by a total of 14 . But in those four Cleveland wins, the Pacers were a plus-10 in 150 minutes with Oladipo on the floor and a minus-24 in 42 minutes with Oladipo on the bench . Essentially, they lost the series when in those minutes that Oladipo sat. Stephenson is now in L.A., replaced by Tyreke Evans. As noted in the table above, Evans had the league\u2019s eighth biggest on-off-court NetRtg differential. The Memphis Grizzlies were 11.4 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-0.2) than they were with him off the floor (minus-11.2) . They were a 22-60 team and somehow a plus-27 in Evans\u2019 1,607 minutes . Indiana also added Doug McDermott and Kyle O\u2019Quinn to the bench, clearly looking to avoid such a big drop-off when their best player steps off the floor.

Today, we look at the Washington Wizards, who didn\u2019t get to the basket. The Wizards took just 28 percent of their shots in the restricted area last season. That was the second lowest rate in the league and down from 33 percent (the 14th highest rate) in 2016-17. No team saw a bigger drop-off. Shots in the restricted area are the most valuable on the floor, worth 1.26 points per attempt, league-wide. Though the league shoots more 3-pointers every year, the best thing you can do offensively is get to the basket or get to the free throw line. When you exchange some layups or dunks for shots from outside the restricted area, you don\u2019t shoot as well. The Wizards saw the league\u2019s sixth biggest drop in effective field goal percentage and its ninth biggest drop in offensive efficiency . You would initially point to John Wall missing 41 games last season as the reason for the drop-off. That was part of it, but the Wizards weren\u2019t much more efficient in games that Wall played (107.4 points scored per 100 possessions) than they were in the games he missed (106.4). They actually saw a bigger drop-off in the percentage of their shots that came from the restricted area in Wall\u2019s minutes on the floor (from 34 percent in 2016-17 to 29 percent last season) than they did in in Wall\u2019s minutes off the floor (from 28 percent to 27 percent). Wall dealt with multiple injury absences, and when he played, he wasn\u2019t the player we were used to. Last season, he averaged just 3.5 fast break points per 36 minutes, the fewest of his career and down from 5.9 the season prior. With his absence and with him not at his best, the Wizards saw the league\u2019s second biggest drop in the percentage of their shots that came in the first six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. When Wall did get out on the break, he scored just 0.95 points per possession in transition, down from 1.12 in 2016-17 and the second-lowest rate among 41 players who averaged at least three transition possessions per game in 40 games or more . Wall took 34 percent of his shots in the restricted area. That wasn\u2019t the lowest mark of his career, but it was down from 40 percent in \u201916-17. And he definitely wasn\u2019t the only Wizard who saw a drop. Across the roster, Wizards players didn\u2019t get to the basket as much as they did the season prior. They did shoot more from 3-point range last season, but saw a big drop in the percentage of their 3-pointers that came from the corners. Wall ranks third in assists on corner 3-pointers over the last four seasons and his presence was certainly missed in that regard. A healthier Wall will help. Though they were eliminated in the first round, Wall did see the biggest jump in PRA (points + rebounds + assists) from the regular season (32.7) to the postseason (43.2) among 175 players who played in at least four playoff games. Also, the Wizards did see a jump in the percentage of their shots that came from the restricted area. The jump wasn\u2019t as big as the drop they saw from one season to the next, though. And a healthier Wall isn\u2019t the solution to all their issues either. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have to find a new source for offense. Over the last four seasons, the Cavs have ranked second in both 3-point percentage and the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range. In 3-point percentage, the Cavs only trail the Golden State Warriors (duh) over the last four years. In the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range, the Cavs only trail the Houston Rockets (duh, part II). Over the last four years, the Cavs were built around the unique talents of LeBron James, who made or assisted on 1,621 (43 percent) of the Cavs\u2019 3,754 3-pointers over the four seasons (59 percent of the 3-pointers the team made with him on the floor). James\u2019 teams have now ranked in the top six in offensive efficiency for 10 straight seasons. James is gone, but the shooters that complemented him are still around. The Cavs have five players \u2014 Channing Frye, George Hill, Kyle Korver, Kevin Love and J.R. Smith \u2014 who rank in the top 50 in 3-point percentage (minimum of 500 attempts) over the last three years. No other team has more than three. The question now is how those shooters are going to get fed. The primary candidate to (try to) fill the void left by James is Love. The five-time All-Star can\u2019t create off the dribble like James, but he might be able to create from the post (on the block or even at the elbow). Love hasn\u2019t exactly been a high-volume post player. Last season he ranked 20th with 4.5 post-ups per game and 93rd with just 1.6 elbow touches per game . Even in his last season in Minnesota, Love\u2019s 8.8 post-ups per game ranked 11th. Furthermore, in his four years in Cleveland, only 28 percent of the shots taken off of Love\u2019s passes have come from 3-point range. Over the same time, 46 percent of the shots taken off of James\u2019 passes have come from 3-point range. That comparison isn\u2019t fair to Love, of course. James is the greatest producer of open 3-point shots that this league has ever seen. But that discrepancy \u2014 46 percent vs. 28 percent \u2014 is worth noting as Cleveland tries to reconstruct its offense without the guy who has produced so much of its offense over the last four years. As for his own 3-point shooting, Love will miss having James around. Over the last four seasons, Love has shot 39 percent from 3-point range with James on the floor and just 31 percent with James off the floor. The percentage of his total shots that have come from 3-point range has been much higher with James on the floor as well. The last time James left Cleveland, the Cavs suffered the biggest winning percentage drop in NBA history . They shouldn\u2019t suffer as much this time, but it will be fascinating to see how they generate offense, even with one All-Star still left on the roster.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant have since passed Chamberlain, and two players are poised to knock Chamberlain further down the list this season. Those players, of course, are LeBron James and Dirk Nowitzki, who continue to defy Father Time as they climb various statistical leaderboards. Here\u2019s a preview of some of the major milestones within reach for James, Nowitzki and several other players (and one coach) during the 2018-19 season. \u2022 Points: James enters his 16th season in seventh place on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list , with 31,038 points and is likely to pass Nowitzki (No. 6), Chamberlain (No. 5) and Jordan (No. 4) this season. James begins the season 1,254 points behind Jordan, which is about 46 games\u2019 worth of points for LeBron based on his career average (27.2 ppg). \u2022 Assists: James needs 317 assists to pass Andre Miller for 10th place , which is about 45 games\u2019 worth of assists for LeBron based on his career average (7.2 apg). \u2022 Field Goals Made: James needs 51 made field goals to pass Shaquille O\u2019Neal for sixth place and 440 buckets (roughly 45 games\u2019 worth on average) to pass Bryant for fifth place. \u2022 Seasons: Nowitzki will set an NBA record for most seasons played with one team (21), breaking a tie with Bryant, who spent 20 seasons with the Lakers. Nowitzki will tie the NBA record for most seasons played overall (21), joining Robert Parish, Kevin Willis and Kevin Garnett. (Vince Carter will also match the NBA record this season.) \u2022 Points: Nowitzki, No. 6 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, needs 233 points to pass Chamberlain, who is in fifth place. (Note: James is only 150 points behind Nowitzki.) \u2022 Wins: Nowitzki has been a part of 899 regular-season wins. With his next victory, he will become the sixth player in NBA history with at least 900 wins, joining Abdul-Jabbar (1,074), Parish (1,014), Tim Duncan (1,001), John Stockton (953) and Karl Malone (952). \u2022 Games: Nowitzki is 29 games from 1,500 for his career, a mark reached by only three players: Parish (1,611 games), Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) and Stockton (1,504). \u2022 Seasons: Carter will tie the NBA record for most seasons played (21), joining Parish, Willis and Garnett. (Nowitzki will also match the NBA record this season.) \u2022 Points: Carter, No. 22 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, needs 132 points to reach 25,000. \u2022 3-pointers: Curry, No. 7 on the NBA\u2019s all-time list for 3-pointers made , could crack the top three this season, depending on his performance and that of the active players ahead of him. Curry needs 15 three-pointers to pass Paul Pierce for sixth place. Curry trails No. 5 Jamal Crawford by 24 3-pointers. \u2022 Triple-Doubles: Westbrook needs four triple-doubles to pass Jason Kidd for third place on the NBA\u2019s all-time list. Westbrook needs 35 triple-doubles to pass Magic Johnson for second place. Current top four in triple-doubles: Oscar Robertson (181), Johnson (138), Kidd (107) and Westbrook (104). \u2022 Assists: Paul, No. 9 on the NBA\u2019s all-time assists list , has a chance to move up to seventh this season. He needs 259 assists (about 27 games\u2019 worth based on his career average) to pass Gary Payton for eighth place and 354 assists (about 37 games\u2019 worth) to pass Isiah Thomas for seventh. \u2022 Steals: Paul, No. 12 on the NBA\u2019s all-time steals list , is poised to crack the top 10 this season. He needs 68 steals to pass Mookie Blaylock for 11th place and 78 steals to pass Karl Malone for 10th.  \u2022 Points: Anthony, No. 19 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list , needs 197 points to pass Alex English for 18th place. Depending on his production in Houston, Anthony could pass Robertson (No. 12) and Hakeem Olajuwon (No. 11) this season. Kevin Garnett (No. 17), Pierce (No. 15) and Duncan (No. 13) are among the players between Anthony and The Big O.  \u2022 Rebounds: Howard, No. 14 on the NBA\u2019s all-time rebounding list , needs 648 rebounds to pass Olajuwon for 13th place and 669 to pass Wes Unseld for 12th place \u2014 roughly 50 games\u2019 worth of rebounds for Howard based on his career average (12.7 rpg). \u2022 Blocks: Howard, No. 17 on the NBA\u2019s all-time blocks list , could climb as high as 13th this season. The next four players ahead of him are George Johnson (No. 16), Manute Bol (No. 15), Shawn Bradley (No. 14) and Ben Wallace (No. 13).  \u2022 Wins: Popovich is three victories shy of becoming the fifth coach in NBA history with 1,200 wins. Popovich (No. 5) needs 14 wins to pass Pat Riley (No. 4) and 25 wins to pass Jerry Sloan (No. 3) on the career wins list. \u2022 Playoff Streak: Under Popovich, the Spurs have reached the playoffs in 21 consecutive seasons (1997-98 to 2017-18), tied with Portland (1982-83 to 2002-03) for the second-longest streak in NBA history. If the Spurs make the playoffs this season, they will tie the NBA record for consecutive playoff appearances. The Syracuse Nationals\/Philadelphia 76ers hold the record of 22 straight playoff trips (1949-50 to 1970-71).

Today, we look at the Miami Heat, who were comfortable in the clutch. The Heat played 53 games, most in the league , that were within five points in the last five minutes. Teams have played more \u201cclutch\u201d games in previous seasons; The Wizards played 55 the season prior . But there was one eight-week stretch last season (from Dec. 30 \u2013 Feb. 23) in which 23 of 24 Heat games were within five points in the last five minutes. That is kind of wild. The Heat played good teams tough. They went 9-8 against the top five teams in the East last season and they had the league\u2019s best defense in games against top-10 offenses . At the same time, they didn\u2019t have a very big margin for error against bad teams. Among the 18 teams that finished with winning records, they ranked last in time (256 total minutes) with a lead of 15 points or more. On the surface, the Heat weren\u2019t excessively lucky in going 29-24 in those games that were within five in the last five. They were 15-14 otherwise, ranked seventh defensively overall , and there was just a one-game difference between their 44 actual wins and their 43 \u201cexpected\u201d wins (based on point differential). But there\u2019s always some randomness in close-game results, which can depend on one or two possessions. And there\u2019s a reason to wonder about how well the Heat performed offensively in the clutch. Though three other teams had a bigger differential in how efficiently they scored, the Heat were the only team that ranked in the top 10 in clutch offense ( eighth \u2013 113.1 points scored per 100 possessions ) and in the bottom 10 in non-clutch offense (24th \u2013 104.0). And what you really have to wonder about is the Heat\u2019s 3-point shooting in the clutch. On non-clutch possessions, the Heat shot 35.9 percent from 3-point range, a little worse than the league average (36.4 percent). But on clutch possessions, the Heat shot a league-best 39.2 percent from 3-point range , much better than the league average (31.2 percent). Only two other teams \u2013 Boston (38.1 percent vs. 37.7 percent) and Philadelphia (37.1 percent vs. 36.8 percent) \u2013 shot better on clutch threes than they did on non-clutch threes. The Sixers and Heat ranked first and second, respectively, in both the percentage of their (overall) 3-pointers that were assisted and the percentage of their 3-point attempts that came off the catch (according to Second Spectrum tracking). You could argue that being a more off-the-catch 3-point shooting team helps you in the clutch, when a lack of ball movement can be an issue. But league-wide, there wasn\u2019t much of a correlation between the percentage of a team\u2019s 3-point attempts that came off the catch and how much its 3-point percentage improved or dropped off in the clutch. So we\u2019re left with a conclusion that the Heat were a little lucky in the clutch last season. Wayne Ellington led them in clutch 3-point attempts , but the percentage of the team\u2019s total threes that he attempted in the clutch (23 percent) was the same as it was in non-clutch situations. James Johnson, meanwhile, shot 7-for-16 (44 percent) on clutch threes and 50-for-169 (30 percent) on non-clutch threes. Unless they pull of a trade in the next couple of weeks, the Heat will go into the season with nearly the same roster that they had last season. And if they\u2019re going to remain an Eastern Conference playoff team, the margin for error will remain thin, and they won\u2019t necessarily be able to count on the same results in the clutch. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Utah Jazz, who were better than their record said they were. Last season, the Jazz were 48-34, with the point differential of a team that was 55-27. That was tied for the biggest differential between \u201cexpected wins\u201d (a number calculated using a team\u2019s point differential) and actual wins last season. The Jazz finished fifth in the Western Conference , but they had the Western Conference\u2019s third best point differential at plus-4.3 points per game , comfortably ahead of the fourth-ranked Oklahoma City Thunder (plus-3.4). The expected-win differential wasn\u2019t about Utah\u2019s performance in close games. In fact, the Jazz were tied with the Golden State Warriors for the fewest clutch games (those that were within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter) in the league. They Jazz weren\u2019t great in those 29 clutch games (16-13), but the point differential was more about games that weren\u2019t close. The Jazz won seven games by 30 or more points , including three by 40 or more. They didn\u2019t lose any games by that much and also had more than twice as many wins by 15 or more ( 22 ) as losses by 15 or more ( 10 ). Some of those big wins came against bad teams, but even in games played between the 18 teams that finished with winning record, the Jazz had the second biggest differential between their \u201cexpected\u201d record 29-23 and their actual record 26-26. The Jazz had wins of 30, 19 and 40 points over the Warriors , and in only one of those three games (the 19-point loss) did the champs play fewer than three of their four All-Stars. The question now is whether Utah\u2019s expected-win differential is an indication that the Jazz will be better next season. They\u2019re returning player who accounted for 85 percent of last season\u2019s minutes (the league\u2019s third highest rate), but are they starting from a baseline of 48-34 or 55-37? Since 1996-97 (eliminated lockout-shortened seasons and those that preceded them), there is a slightly stronger correlation between a team\u2019s \u201cexpected\u201d wins and how many games they won the following season than there is between the team\u2019s actual wins their following-season total. But of the 18 teams that had an expected-win differential of seven games or more, only seven were improved (in regard to actual wins) the following season. Of course, one of those seven was the 2015-16 Jazz, who were 40-42 with the point differential of a team that was 47-35. That year, the problem was how bad they were in close games . And the following season, the Jazz went 51-31. When discussing what the Jazz can do this season, we must first take into account that their best defensive player \u2014 Rudy Gobert \u2014 missed 26 games last season and that they went 30-8, with the league\u2019s best point differential , after Gobert returned from injury in mid-January. We must also take into account that their best offensive player \u2014 Donovan Mitchell \u2014 is only 22 years old and just put in his first summer of work after getting a taste of the league. Finally, we can acknowledge that last season\u2019s Jazz were better than their record said they were. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts.

(AP) \u2014 Even the two-time defending NBA champions are seeking ways to reinvent themselves when it comes to preparation and practice routine. The Golden State Warriors are putting a greater emphasis on player development this training camp with a younger roster. An hour ahead of formal team workouts, Golden State\u2019s young core shows up for individual skill work, to learn defensive concepts or to go over offensive schemes and terminology with assistant coach Chris DeMarco. \u201cWe have a veteran team, so being able to get these young guys in and still be able to do drill work that maybe the veterans don\u2019t need, that\u2019s always going to be beneficial moving forward because it\u2019s a long season,\u201d DeMarco said after practice Tuesday. \u201cSo sometimes you get caught up and you\u2019re not able to practice, there\u2019s back-to-backs where the young guys aren\u2019t out there developing those skills that we need them to develop. So coming in early, making sure they\u2019re getting that individual work, making sure they\u2019re getting that team defense concept, offensively what we\u2019re trying to do, the actions and all that, that\u2019s important.\u201d Veterans such as Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green, meanwhile, may use that time to work on their bodies in the training room or weightlifting before Steve Kerr\u2019s entire squad comes together for an efficient, shorter workout some days if that\u2019s all the coaches deem the Warriors need. Or, those older players might just grab some extra rest. That slight adjustment to the practice approach has made for what Kerr considers the best camp of his tenure as he enters his fifth season running the show. Golden State also didn\u2019t have to travel like the trip the Warriors made to China last year that took a physical toll. \u201cThe continuity that we have with the group combined with a really good crop of young guys, both the guys we know will be on our roster and the guys trying out, and some of whom will end up in Santa Cruz, working really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve figured some things out as a coaching staff how to streamline practice, make it more efficient, cleaner.\u201d DeMarco, recently promoted to assistant coach and director of player development, is leading the young Warriors after the departures of three key veterans in JaVale McGee, David West and Zaza Pachulia. There\u2019s a youth movement now, and Golden State is determined to sustain its recent success \u2014 three titles in four years \u2014 even with the challenges of keeping an All-Star-studded roster together in free agency next summer. By having the younger players do their work earlier, Kerr can run more focused practices with fewer breaks by going straight from one drill to the next. \u201cAs a result, they\u2019re up to speed by the time the whole group gets out on the floor,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been looking to do over the last year, is kind of improve our player development program. It was hard to do last year because we had so many veterans. We were kind of left with about three young guys who we could work out more individual work stuff, but now we have a pretty clear five, six, seven young guys who need work and I like the format that we have with them.\u201d Green sat out Tuesday\u2019s practice with a sore knee following an intense two-hour session Monday, Kerr said. And after that heavy scrimmage day to start the week, Golden State went lighter and shorter for Tuesday\u2019s session. About an hour and that was it. After last season, Kerr\u2019s staff and even general manager Bob Myers brainstormed ways they could be even better with a younger roster. Player development became a bigger focus point. \u201cIt definitely has been structured, our guys are putting the work in,\u201d DeMarco said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great.\u201d"},{"id":38465,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-jahlil-okafor-ankle-sprain-out-1-2-weeks","date":"2018-10-02","title":"New Orleans Pelicans: Jahlil Okafor out 1-2 weeks with right-ankle sprain","content":" NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The New Orleans Pelicans say center Jahlil Okafor has been diagnosed with a sprained right ankle and is expected to miss one or two weeks.

Today, we look at the New York Knicks, who were still mired in the mid-range. The Knicks\u2019 ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts was just 1.03, the lowest in the league. Last season was the first in which every single team attempted more shots from 3-point range than they did from mid-range (between the paint and the 3-point line). Just seven seasons ago, there were only four teams that attempted more threes than mid-range shots. The Knicks were one of those four teams. For five straight seasons \u2013 from 2008-09 (Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s first season as Knicks head coach) through 2012-13 \u2013 the Knicks ranked in the top three in three-to-mid-range ratio. That included the only two seasons \u2013 \u201910-11 and \u201912-13 \u2013 in the last 40 years that the Knicks ranked in the *top five in offensive efficiency. * Also the only two seasons in the last 26 years that they\u2019ve ranked in the top 10. Either way you frame it, it ain\u2019t been pretty. But they slipped to 17th in three-to-mid-range ratio in 2013-14, and then to 25th in \u201914-15, the season in which Phil Jackson and Derek Fisher installed the triangle offense (or \u201ctriangle principles\u201d). And they\u2019ve remained in the bottom six for four straight seasons. Even with the departures of both Jackson and Carmelo Anthony (who attempted 1,511 more mid-range shots than threes in his 6 1\/2 seasons with the Knicks), the team barely saw a budge in its ratio, which, at 1.03, was about 1\/6 that of the Houston Rockets (6.17). In fact, the Knicks actually took a lower percentage of their shots from 3-point range last season (27 percent, 29th in the league ) than they did the season prior (28 percent, 25th ). They were one of two teams \u2013 San Antonio (26th, 27th) was the other \u2013 that ranked in the bottom five in both 3-point percentage (27th) and the percentage of shots that came from 3-point range (29th). They just saw a big increase in shots in the paint. The Knicks were actually a decent shooting team last season, ranking 12th in field goal percentage at 46.4 percent. But because of their low rate of threes, they ranked 24th in effective field goal percentage (51.0 percent). Only Minnesota had a smaller differential between the two percentages. Last season, Kristaps Porzingis led the league with 9.0 catch-and-shoot jumpers per game , but only 49 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers were from beyond the arc. League-wide, 81 percent of catch-and-shoot jumpers were threes, and Porzingis was one of only nine players who attempted at least *200 catch-and-shoot jumpers, with more than half of them coming from inside the arc. * In total, 134 players took at least 200 catch-and-shoot jumpers, according to Second Spectrum tracking. As the table above clearly illustrates, the league has quickly realized the relative value of 3-pointers and mid-range shots. Over the last three seasons, the league has shot 36 percent from 3-point range, yielding a value of 1.07 points per attempt. At the same time, it has shot 40 percent from mid-range, yielding a value of just 0.80 points per attempt. Last season, having a league-average three-to-mid-range ratio (1.77) instead of the league low (1.03) would have been worth an additional 133 points for the Knicks. That translates to a jump from 24th to 17th in offensive efficiency and an additional five wins. Five additional wins wouldn\u2019t have got the Knicks anywhere close to playoff position. And, without Porzingis for at least a couple of months, it\u2019s doubtful that they\u2019ll be competing for a spot in the postseason this year. But the time is now for new head coach David Fizdale to build a foundation for how the Knicks are going to play on both ends of the floor. It was five years ago that Brett Brown did just that in Philadelphia, and the Sixers jumped from 28th to third in three-to-mid-range ratio in his first season (more than doubling the team\u2019s rate of the season prior). Suffering from a lack of talent, Philly proceeded to rank 30th in offensive efficiency in each of Brown\u2019s first four years, but the Sixers had the league\u2019s most improved offense last season and look like a perennial Eastern Conference contender, playing the same way (with pace and space) that they\u2019ve been playing since Brown took over. In Fizdale\u2019s first season in Memphis, the Grizzlies jumped from 23rd (0.87) to 12th (1.51) in three-to-mid-range ratio, so we can expect the Knicks to at least climb out of the basement this year. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the New Orleans Pelicans, who improved their shooting by shooting closer to the basket. Last season, the Pelicans were the league\u2019s most improved shooting team, with an effective field goal percentage of 54.1 percent ( fourth in the league ), up from 50.4 percent ( 19th ) in 2016-17. That wasn\u2019t a huge jump historically. Two teams \u2013 the Nuggets and Lakers \u2013 saw bigger jumps from 2015-16 to \u201916-17. But effective field goal percentage is the most important of the \u201cfour factors\u201d on both ends of the floor, and a big step forward in how effectively you shoot is a big step forward offensively. So, though the Pelicans saw the league\u2019s second biggest increase in turnover percentage \u2013 from 12.7 per 100 possessions ( fourth fewest ) in 2016-17 to 14.4 ( 16th fewest in the league ) last season \u2013 and remained in the bottom 10 in both free throw rate and offensive rebounding percentage, they saw the league\u2019s second biggest increase in offensive efficiency. They scored 107.7 points per 100 possessions ( ninth ), up from 103.3 ( 26th ) in \u201916-17. It was just the third time in the 16 seasons since they moved to New Orleans that the Pelicans (formerly the Hornets) ranked in the top 10 offensively. The Pelicans did see a small jump in 3-point percentage, rising from 19th (35.0 percent) to 13th (36.2 percent). They also saw an increase in the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range, but so did 21 other teams, so they fell in the rankings in that regard, from 16th (31 percent) to 20th (32 percent). Really, it was in the paint where the Pels became much stronger offensively. And they did it by shooting better and more often inside. There were seven teams that saw bigger increases, but the Pelicans went from 20th (31 percent) in 2016-17 to seventh (33 percent) in regard to the percentage of their shots that came from the restricted area, the spot on the floor that yields the most points per field goal attempt league-wide (1.26). Both DeMarcus Cousins (from 41 percent to 44 percent) and Anthony Davis (from 32 percent to 41 percent) saw jumps in the percentage of their shots that came from the restricted area, and Davis one of the best high-volume finishers at the rim . But it wasn\u2019t just the bigs. Jrue Holiday also saw career-high marks in both the percentage of his shots that came from the restricted area (35 percent) and how well he shot there (64.4 percent). The latter number was a career high by a wide margin (up from 56.5 percent over his previous three seasons). E\u2019Twaun Moore\u2019s 65.6 percent in the restricted area ranked fifth among 32 players 6-5 or shorter with 200 or more attempts. The Pelicans also saw an increase in the percentage of their shots that came from elsewhere in the paint. That\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, because non-restricted-area paint shots are worth the least league-wide (0.79 points per attempt), but New Orleans was the best in the league on those shots at 46.1 percent . Moore (51 percent) and Holiday (48 percent) both ranked in the top six among players who attempted at least 200 of those non-restricted-area paint shots, while Ian Clark (51 percent) was in the top seven among players who attempted at least 100 . Of course, things changed when Cousins was lost for the season to an Achilles injury on Jan. 26. At that point, the Pelicans ranked sixth offensively (108.3 points scored per 100 possessions), with the league\u2019s third best effective field goal percentage (54.9 percent). Without Cousins, their free throw rate took a big drop, they didn\u2019t get to the basket as often, they didn\u2019t shoot as many threes, and their mid-range attempts climbed back up. They still shot pretty well (ranking 10th in effective field goal percentage) and cut down on turnovers. They still finished with a league-high 52.4 points in the paint per game . But the Pels ranked 17th offensively after Jan. 26 and, though Davis led the league in scoring from that point on , it was defense (where they ranked fifth after Jan. 26 ) that played a bigger role in them being able to hold onto the 6 seed in the Western Conference. And then, in a first round series against a top-10 defense, the Pelicans went and scored 115 points per 100 possessions , with Davis and Holiday combining to averaged 30 points per game (on 75 percent shooting) in the restricted area alone . The offense fell apart in the conference semifinals against the back-to-back champs, Cousins is gone for good, and some of that non-restricted-area paint shooting might be unsustainable. But the Pels have replaced Cousins with the guy \u2013 Julius Randle \u2013 who scored the fifth most points (802) in the restricted area last season . This league isn\u2019t just about 3-pointers, and the Pelicans might be able to prove it again. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum will oversee the WNBA on an interim basis, and a search for a new league president will commence immediately. \u201cWe are extremely grateful for Lisa\u2019s leadership and tireless commitment to the WNBA,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cThis is a natural transition for Lisa knowing what a champion she is for issues involving women\u2019s empowerment and social justice and fortunately for us, she leaves the league with strong tail winds propelling it forward.\u201d Since joining the WNBA in 2016, Borders has accelerated the league\u2019s growth in several key areas. In 2017, the WNBA recorded its highest regular-season attendance in six years and provided new ways for fans to engage with the league through livestreamed games on Twitter and the launch of the WNBA\u2019s first official one-day fantasy game with FanDuel. In addition, a full roster of WNBA teams and players appeared in a video game for the first time in NBA LIVE 18. In 2018, the WNBA delivered its most-watched season in four years, with combined viewership across ESPN networks and NBA TV up double digits. In addition, under Borders\u2019 leadership, the league launched \u201cTake a Seat, Take a Stand,\u201d a program that donates a portion of WNBA ticket proceeds to designated nonprofit organizations committed to empowering women and girls.  Borders also played a pivotal role in bringing a WNBA team to the Las Vegas market with the Las Vegas Aces. \u201cIt has been an honor and my absolute privilege leading the WNBA and being part of what it stands for,\u201d said Borders. \u201cI want to thank Adam for giving me the opportunity and support to help grow this league. I am most proud of the W players for their amazing talents on the court and their dedication to making an impact in their communities. I look forward to continuing my support for the W in my new role with Time\u2019s Up. I will always be the W\u2019s biggest advocate and fan.\u201d Time\u2019s Up is an organization that insists on safe, fair and dignified work for women of all kinds. In her new role, Borders will continue the organization\u2019s work to ensure equal opportunity and protection for all working women, seizing this unprecedented moment and transforming it into meaningful and institutionalized change across culture, companies and laws. Prior to joining the WNBA, Borders worked in all three sectors: public, private and non-profit. She served as Chair of the Coca-Cola Foundation and Vice President, Global Community Affairs at The Coca-Cola Company.  Borders was also President of the City Council and Vice Mayor of Atlanta, where her duties included managing the legislative branch of government and maintaining the relationship with the Mayor\u2019s office during Mayor Shirley Franklin\u2019s administration. She was also President of the Grady Health Foundation, the fundraising arm of Grady Health System, Georgia\u2019s largest public hospital and metro-Atlanta\u2019s premier level I trauma center where she successfully led a five-year $325 million capital campaign.

And with that, Irving made clear that he regrets publicly saying that the Earth is flat. Speaking Monday at the Forbes Under 30 summit in Boston, the flat-Earth topic that Irving inserted himself into last year was discussed \u2014 and the All-Star guard said he didn\u2019t realize the effect that his claim would have once it went public. \u201cTo all the science teachers, everybody coming up to me like, `You know I\u2019ve got to reteach my whole curriculum?\u2019 I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Irving said, as the room attending his session laughed. \u201cI apologize. I apologize.\u201d Irving said he\u2019s since learned certain thoughts are best kept in \u201cintimate conversations.\u201d This whole saga started in February 2017, when Irving questioned whether the Earth is flat on a podcast that came out shortly before All-Star weekend that year in New Orleans. It became a major story and even NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \u2014 who, like Irving, went to Duke \u2014 was asked to offer his opinion. \u201cKyrie and I went to the same college,\u201d Silver said then. \u201cHe may have taken some different courses.\u201d Irving indicated in the days and months that followed the podcast that he initially made the remarks to promote conversation and prove a point how stories in this social-media age can spread rapidly. But then he told The New York Times in early June of this year that he was not completely sure whether the Earth was flat or round. \u201cI do research on both sides,\u201d Irving said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not against anyone that thinks the Earth is round. I\u2019m not against anyone that thinks it\u2019s flat.

Today, we look at the Milwaukee Bucks, who struggled to protect the rim last season. Bucks opponents took 37 percent of their shots from the restricted area. That was the highest rate in the league by a pretty wide margin. The league has seen an increase in the percentage of its shots that have come from 3-point range in each of the last seven seasons, with the rate rising from 22 percent to 34 percent over that stretch. But restricted area shots remain the most efficient on the floor, worth 1.26 points per attempt. So, while offenses stretch defenses out more than they ever have, protecting the basket remains a priority. Preventing restricted-area shots doesn\u2019t solve all your problems defensively. The Dallas Mavericks allowed just 27 percent of their opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s lowest rate, to come from the restricted area and ranked 18th in defensive efficiency last season . Two teams in the bottom five in regard to preventing layups and dunks \u2013 Houston and Toronto \u2013 ranked in the top five defensively. But preventing restricted-area shots is still an issue that needs to be cleaned up. And its been an issue in Milwaukee for a long time. Amazingly, last season was the seventh straight year in which the Bucks ranked in the bottom five in regard to preventing shots in the restricted area. They\u2019ve had five different coaches over that streak, which began two years before they drafted Giannis Antetokounmpo. Last season, the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from the restricted area vs. the league average was the second highest mark over that streak, just a hair below the mark in the 2012-13 season. And in allowing their opponents to shoot better than 63 percent on those shots, it was the Bucks\u2019 worst season at protecting the rim over the seven years. In Jason Kidd\u2019s first season as head coach (2014-15), the Bucks allowed 9.6 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did the season before. In the last 40 years, only one team \u2013 the San Antonio Spurs from 1996-97 to \u201997-98, when they drafted Tim Duncan and got David Robinson back from injury \u2013 has improved more defensively from one season to the next . Those \u201914-15 Bucks ranked in the top 10 in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint and opponent effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint, while forcing a league-high 17.7 turnovers per 100 possessions . But as opponents adjusted to (and figured out how to take advantage of) their aggressive defense, they suffered slippage in opponent effective field goal percentage and opponent turnover rate . And they\u2019ve never been particularly good at keeping their opponents off the free throw line or finishing defensive possessions with rebounds. According to Synergy play-type tracking, only 12.3 percent of the Bucks\u2019 opponent possessions, the lowest rate in the league , were in transition last season. And according to Second Spectrum tracking, they forced their opponents to take 20 percent of their shots, the highest rate in the league, in the last six seconds of the shot clock (when league-wide effective field goal percentage is lowest). If you\u2019re forcing your opponents to play in the half court and late into the clock, you should be doing a better job of preventing layups and dunks. But that wasn\u2019t the case for the Bucks, who allowed a league high 38.9 points per game in the restricted area . The Bucks prevented restricted-area shots better with John Henson at center than they did with Thon Maker at center. With Maker on the floor, opponents took 39 percent of their shots in the restricted area. That was the highest rate (by a pretty wide margin) among 255 players that were on the floor for at least 2,000 opponent field goal attempts last season. Henson had the third highest mark (36 percent \u2013 still would have ranked last on a team level) among big men. Last season, opponents took 32 percent of their shots in the restricted area against the Los Angeles Lakers when new Bucks center Brook Lopez was on the floor. That mark was a little higher than the league average, but was significantly lower than the mark of Lakers opponents when Lopez was off the floor (35 percent). More important than the personnel is the scheme, which is where new head coach Mike Budenholzer comes in. Budenholzer had the benefit of having Al Horford or Dwight Howard as his starting center in his first four seasons in Atlanta, but with neither last season, the Hawks still ranked in the top six in regard to preventing shots in the restricted area. Though he\u2019s probably best known for his egalitarian offense that turned heads and ranked sixth four years ago , its on defense where Budenholzer ranked in the top 10 in three of his five seasons in Atlanta and where he most needs to make an impact in Milwaukee.

Today, we look at the Orlando Magic, who were rather anemic offensively after the All-Star break. The Magic scored just 98.6 points per 100 possessions after the All-Star break last season. That ranked last in the league and was down from 104.6 points per 100 possessions ( 19th ) before the break. That drop of six points per 100 possessions was the league\u2019s biggest post-break drop in offensive efficiency and the fourth biggest drop in the 20 full (82-game) seasons since 1996-97. The Magic didn\u2019t get to the line as often or grab as many offensive rebounds after the break as they did before it. But they weren\u2019t particularly good at those things in the first place. Shooting is the most important thing in this league and the area in which the Magic fell off most last season. Before the All-Star break, they ranked 14th in effective field goal percentage at 52.0 percent (slightly below the league average of 52.1 percent). After the break, they ranked 29th in effective field goal percentage at 49.2 percent (with the league average climbing a tick to 52.2 percent). The Magic rotation player with the best effective field goal percentage before the break ( 54.7 percent ) was Elfrid Payton, who was sent to Phoenix at the deadline. But Payton\u2019s minutes and shots were absorbed by D.J. Augustin and Shelvin Mack, who combined for an even better effective field goal percentage after the break (54.9 percent). More of an issue was the absence of Evan Fournier for 17 of the Magic\u2019s 25 post-break games. Fournier\u2019s effective field goal percentage was a little lower than Payton\u2019s, but still better than the league average. He offered both spacing and additional playmaking, and the Magic offense was at its best ( 106.2 points scored per 100 possessions ) with Fournier on the floor last season. The Magic\u2019s most-used post-break lineup \u2013 D.J. Augustin, Jonathon Simmons, Evan Fournier, Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic \u2013 scored 111.2 points per 100 possessions (a rate which would have ranked sixth after the break) in its 165 post-break minutes . But it was only available for eight of the team\u2019s 25 games after the break, with continuity being an issue. It was an issue for most of the season. The three Magic players who averaged the most minutes per game last season \u2013 Gordon, Fournier and Vucevic \u2013 each missed at least 25 games. Terrence Ross played just 24 and Jonathan Isaac (the No. 6 pick in the 2017 Draft) played just 27. The Magic\u2019s opening-night starting lineup \u2013 Payton, Fournier, Ross, Gordon and Vucevic \u2013 played in just 11 games together . Of course, lots of teams have to deal with injuries, but the Magic didn\u2019t have the depth to absorb all those missed games. They Magic were the second most improved team in regard to aggregate bench NetRtg, but only because they ranked last by a huge margin in 2016-17 . They still ranked 28th last season and were progressively worse with more of their original starters off the floor. The drop-off was entirely on offense. The Magic didn\u2019t add anybody who\u2019s going to help them on that end of the floor this summer, they\u2019re still without a starting-caliber point guard, and new head coach Steve Clifford is likely to make an bigger impact on defense (see below), but better health will help.

It\u2019s a work in progress. But coach Brett Brown\u2019s decision to replace J.J. Redick in the starting lineup with Fultz, back in the swing of things after a brutal rookie season in Philly, is one he\u2019d like to stick with all year \u2014 just as Brown pushed, after watching Ben Simmons all during the summer of 2017, to make Simmons his full-time starting point guard. Famously, Fultz lost his offensive mojo in Philly last year. Whether due to injuries, the yips \u2014 or, more likely, a combination of both \u2014 he barely registered, something that would be hard enough for the first overall pick in the Draft. But it was even more difficult to digest as a) it happened in Philly, not the most charitable and forgiving of cities, and b) it happened while the Celtics\u2019 Jayson Tatum, the guy Boston took with the third pick overall, acquired in the Fultz deal, looked for all the world like a burgeoning superstar as Boston went to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. Fultz missed five months of action, with a shoulder injury that the Sixers struggled to explain in a way that satisfied anyone for weeks, before finally announcing he suffered from scapular dyskinesis. It was, as a source explained last winter, as if Fultz\u2019s shoulder had suffered a stroke. But the 76ers had, oddly, continued to let everyone see Fultz shoot in practice, when it was obvious he was really struggling with his confidence. He returned late in the regular season and had a couple of solid offensive games, but was an afterthought during the playoffs. Fultz spent his offseason fixing the shot under the tutelage of skills development guru Drew Hanlen. He looked, again, like the guy Brown saw on tape at the University of Washington. And Brown, looking for better matchups throughout his roster, wants to see if Fultz will be better playing alongside Joel Embiid and Simmons, and if Redick will do better coming off the bench. Philly\u2019s new starting lineup debuted on Friday in the Sixers\u2019 first preseason game against Melbourne United. Fultz scored 14 points in 23 minutes, making 6 of 11 shots from the floor. \u201cI thought it was good,\u201d Brown said by phone Sunday. \u201cIt was something I intend to try to learn more about. I feel like when you sort of cut to the chase with Markelle, him allowing me to put him on opposing point guards defensively, interests me greatly to start a game. And offensively, having sort of another type of creator on the floor, and another pick and roll guy, and another sort of push the pace guy, interests me.\u201d You should always be skeptical about offseason workout numbers. Every guy comes back from the summer supposedly having added 15 pounds of muscle, or adding an inch and a half to his vertical. In Fultz\u2019s case, he reportedly took 150,000 shots with Hanlen during the offseason. Really? \u201cMore like 160,000,\u201d Hanlen insisted Sunday via text, saying he has interns who can confirm the count. Hanlen and Fultz got to Philly together on Sept. 2, and he\u2019s been in town with him ever since. After a summer of rebuilding his shot, Fultz displayed a jumper Friday with a higher shot pocket than he\u2019d had most of the offseason. It was part of the ongoing tweaks that are likely to continue throughout the year. Brown told reporters in Philly last week that he consulted with recently retired Manu Ginobili, who had to make a similar transition from starter to top reserve in San Antonio while Brown was an assistant coach under Gregg Popovich, to get Ginobili\u2019s perspective about how he handled it. For a veteran like Redick, a creature of detailed habit in his NBA years as a starter, it\u2019s a very hard adjustment. \u201cI reached out to Manu and Pop, especially Manu, and listened to him\u2019,\u201d Brown said Sunday.  \u201c\u2018Cause I couldn\u2019t remember. It was 10 years ago. I said, what do you remember? I\u2019m considering doing this with J.J. I want to know what you remember from a player\u2019s perspective.\u2019 And I listened to Pop and I listened to that. And we won the Finals that year (2007). And I sat with J.J., and we talked this through. We did this together. I wanted to make sure everything was thought through. It\u2019s a level of respect for him and a level of respect for the team.\u201d The move, Brown hopes, will also help keep Redick fresher on offense by taking defending opposing points off of his plate. (Brown will not add this, but he struggled to find a defensive matchup for Redick anywhere as a starter against Boston in the second round. In Game 1 against the Celtcs, he tried putting Redick on Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum, and Tatum tarred him for a good chunk of his 28 points in a Boston victory on the road. As those teams could well meet again in a late May playoff this coming season, it\u2019s never too early to start thinking about matchups.) Brown insists Redick won\u2019t lose playing time after averaging 30 minutes a game this season. \u201cAs you\u2019re doing this, the notion of ending games is the place, obviously, I\u2019m going to go,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWith J.J., his minutes aren\u2019t going to be reduced; they\u2019re just going to be redistributed.\u201d The 76ers refused to put Fultz in any of their real trade proposals for Kawhi Leonard over the summer. Brown was simply not ready to give up yet on the electric talent he saw in college. Philly didn\u2019t get the elite free agent it hoped it would, but Fultz can help make up for that if he can follow up his work with Hanlen and turn it into production for Brown. \u201cI think he\u2019s looked excellent,\u201d Brown said Sunday, \u201cand I especially think he\u2019s looked excellent in regard to his spirit. He doesn\u2019t shy away from anything. I put him on the free-throw line in front of 30 Philadelphia media people\u2026he was out there for everyone to see. And I saw him for the month of September shoot every shot he should have shot. They didn\u2019t all go in, but he didn\u2019t shy away.\u201d"},{"id":38485,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-mailbag-october-1-2018","date":"2018-10-01","title":"Morning Tip Mailbag: Your questions on Tom Thibodeau, Brooklyn Nets and more","content":" Tired of Tom Telling Teams What He\u2019ll Take for the Tomball, Texas Terror. From Ameer Eldomiatti : Doubt Glen Taylor\u2019s ready to eat the rest of the $40 million he owes Thibodeau through 2021, then go out and spend a few more million to hire a coach of a still-intriguing team, no matter whether Jimmy Butler is there this season or not. And since Taylor has reportedly told teams to contact him to get a deal done with Butler, he\u2019s kind of already cut out his coach\/middleman, so why pay off the rest of his contract? Brooklyn in the house? From Terrence Moore : Yes. I think it\u2019s inevitable. Brooklyn\u2019s front office is too good, and its coaching staff, led by Kenny Atkinson, too promising \u2014 and, last time I checked, Brooklyn is still part of New York City, still the world\u2019s biggest market. With billionaire Joseph Tsai poised to take over for current majority owner Mikhail Prokhorov in the next year or so, the Nets\u2019 cash flow will be on par with any team in the league. All of those pluses are sure to entice a legit free agent, and maybe two, next summer. The Nets are a sleeping giant in the East if they can get an anchor player around which they can surround their young talent like Jarrett Allen. Surprise, surprise. From Leticia Tosado : Maybe sooner than we all think, Leticia. Robinson has, I\u2019m told, followed up his strong Summer League performance with reasonably good absorbing of the Knicks\u2019 concepts and packages so far during training camp. It\u2019s still more likely than not that his minutes will be limited early on; he\u2019s still learning, really, to play within structure for the first time as a basketball player. And, he needs to get stronger to be able to hold his position in the paint, and he\u2019ll have to improve as a post defender. But New York\u2019s braintrust remains resolute that it got a steal in Robinson in the second round. There has never been much question about his athletic ability.

Those injuries forced him to the sideline for the rest of that season, and the Lakers promoted assistant Paul Westhead to the head coach position. Needing to fill Westhead\u2019s spot on the bench, the Lakers promoted their radio analyst to Westhead\u2019s assistant\u2019s job.

It\u2019s season 73 for the NBA, and after a killer offseason where trades and free agent signings kept the Association at the top of the sports world day after day, week after week, we\u2019re back to square one \u2014 Golden State is the best team in the league, its latest dynasty, and the gap between the Warriors and the rest of the league seems to only be growing now that DeMarcus Cousins is on board in the Bay. But, we all saw how vulnerable the Warriors looked when Andre Iguodala went down during the playoffs, and the Rockets were one game away from dethroning the Dubs before Chris Paul went down. You would certainly make the Warriors prohibitive favorites to win a fourth title in five years. Yet there are all manner of new alliances, inter-conference movements, led by LeBron James leaving Cleveland a second time \u2014 this time for the West Coast, and the Lakers \u2014 and coaching changes that should give the 2018-19 season some pizazz. So, it\u2019s time for that annual ritual that indicates another year is upon us: 24 Deep Questions. Just as NBA Twitter was utterly dismissive of any team\u2019s chances to seriously contend against Golden State last season \u2014 Chris Paul would like a world, NBAT \u2014 it is posting early and often this year that the Dubs may well go, Enron-style, after the 2018-19 campaign. For one, Kevin Durant seems determined to hit free agency again next summer, after going for another 1+1 deal last July. (KD maintains he could well sign a long-term deal with Golden State in \u201919.) And, with Durant turning 30 last week, Golden State now has five players in its core group 30 or older. And even if the Warriors re-sign Durant, Klay Thompson will be unrestricted, and could well be more in demand than KD, with more squads feeling they have a realistic shot, along with the requisite dollars, to go get him. Yet all of the talk of a Beatles-like breakup seems premature. Joe Lacob and Peter Guber aren\u2019t building a $2 billion arena, set to open in downtown San Francisco a year from now, to open with an also-ran. As with everything the Warriors have accomplished the last four years, there\u2019s likely a well-thought out game plan that will assure Golden State hegemony for at least another year or two. LeBron James\u2019s Heat and Cavaliers teams made eight straight NBA Finals out of the Eastern Conference since 2010. In those eight seasons \u2014 four in Miami, four in Cleveland \u2014 the best point guard he played with was Kyrie Irving. And when Irving was healthy with James in 2016, the Cavs won it all. But other than Uncle Drew, LeBron spent much of those eight years bringing the ball up himself, or catching it just after midcourt and initiating the offense. That won\u2019t be the case in his first season in Los Angeles \u2014 or, at least it shouldn\u2019t be, with Lonzo Ball and Rajon Rondo battling at the point. But, there\u2019s a huge difference, obviously, between Irving and Ball\/Rondo: Irving has shot better than 40 percent on 3s in three of his last four pro seasons. Ball shot 30.5 percent behind the arc as a rookie; Rondo has never come close to 40 percent on 3s, though he did get up to 37 percent in 2016-17 while in Chicago. The point is, James has long since realized he\u2019s not at his best in a static position, waiting; his game is kinetic, creating havoc for opposing defenses. If that\u2019s the case, one of Rondo or Ball is going to have to be much, much better catching and shooting than they\u2019ve shown. Maybe the Lakers will be, as James said, positionless , and they can use the ballhanding skill of James, Rondo and Ball to create shots for themselves and others. And Ball has put in significant work in the lab this summer on his jumper. But at some point, defenses will lay off and go under screens. Then we\u2019ll see. Utah\u2019s budding superstar spent his summer in the lab, as all great players do, trying to add more to his game. He\u2019ll need to come back this year even stronger, because he has to get himself to the foul line more. Someone who shoots 81 percent on free throws has to take more than 3.8 per game. It\u2019s part of the delicate dance Utah has to perform this season. The push and pull between Mitchell and Rudy Gobert on offense isn\u2019t exactly a problem, but it\u2019s a challenge. Having a spread five on the floor instead of Gobert would give Mitchell more room to drive and draw those fouls, but Gobert also helps Utah immensely as a roller on offense, and is the lynchpin of Utah\u2019s suffocating defense. How will Quin Snyder maintain his team\u2019s selfless concept while ensuring that Mitchell becomes all he can be individuvally? The Rockets didn\u2019t get within one game of The Finals last season because they kept raining 3s on people; they got there because their defense improved significantly \u2014 from 18th in the league in Defensive Rating in 2016-17 (106.4) to eighth (103.8) last season. And the above troika, including Bzdelik, one of the league\u2019s top defensive minds, was a big part of that success. With Ariza and Mbah a Moute on the wings to supplement P.J. Tucker, Houston could switch everything defensively to great effect, and the Rockets gummed up the Warriors\u2019 attack for long stretches in the Western Conference finals. But Ariza is now in Phoenix, and Mbah a Moute in LA, while Bzdelik retired after three-plus decades as a college and pro coach. Mike D\u2019Antoni is talking brave about the guys who are left still being a quality defensive unit, but there\u2019s a reason the Rockets are trying like crazy to get Jimmy Butler (see below) from Minnesota. Best guess: Riles loves stars. Miami eventually works out something with the Wolves that makes Thibs content enough to pull the trigger. Let\u2019s be clear: 26 or 27 other teams would love to have Brad Stevens\u2019s \u201cproblem\u201d in this area: trying to find enough minutes to go around for Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Morris, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojeleye and Aron Baynes. (This doesn\u2019t even count the C\u2019s first-rounder, Robert Williams.) And with Hayward and Irving back in the starting lineup, the ripple effect is real. How does Stevens utilize Terry Rozier, who was electrifying in the postseason in Irving\u2019s absence? What of Smart, who makes Boston\u2019s already good defense elite? Everyone\u2019s saying all the right things about making sacrifices, and needing depth in case of injuries \u2014 and it\u2019s true that everyone isn\u2019t in the same quality of shape at this point of the season, so there\u2019s likely to be some separation, anyway. But it bears watching. The first-time All-Star didn\u2019t rest on his laurels after his breakthrough season for Indiana. He spent most of the summer in Miami, working out like a demon and continuing to sculpt himself physically. The main charge from the Pacers\u2019 braintrust this year: be ready for the doubles. They\u2019re coming. The Cavaliers attacked him aggressively in the later stages of the teams\u2019 first-round series last spring, and while Oladipo adjusted \u2014 a triple-double in Game 6, with 28, 13 and 10 \u2014 it\u2019s likely going to be a regular staple this year. (Among the specific goals this season: an assist-turnover ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.) If Oladipo can find shooters better in the pocket and make the right decisions in transition, the Pacers believe they can take yet another jump up offensively this season. Oladipo already has the team leader thing down. \u201cMost positive person I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d said team president Kevin Pritchard. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to talk about,\u201d Leonard told Turner\u2019s Steve Smith last week after Media Day. \u201cThat\u2019s for you guys to mention on TV. But for me, myself, my family, we\u2019re all focused on being in Toronto, and this season. I can\u2019t look past that, or I\u2019m not going to play well.\u201d Everyone\u2019s on their best behavior for now, and Leonard, other than working off some rust built up after only playing nine games last season, has looked more or less like the two-time All-Star the Raptors got from the Spurs for DeMar DeRozan. Toronto\u2019s GM Masai Ujiri swears there have been no undue bells or whistles in the franchise\u2019s recruitment of Leonard going forward. Leonard will no doubt be available and professional in Canada all season. I still think he will be a Clipper 12 months from now. We\u2019ll see. 9a) Rich Paul is LeBron James\u2019 agent, and among the most high-powered player reps in the game. 9b) LeBron is now with the Lakers. 9c) The Lakers will have space next summer, and for a while, to add another marquee free agent to play alongside James \u2014 who\u2019s committed in L.A. for four seasons. 9d) Davis can opt out of his deal in two years, after the 2019-20 season. 9e) The Pelicans should have enough cap space after this season \u2014 Nikola Mirotic ($12.5 million this season) comes off their books, as does another $11 million or so from among Alexis Ajinca, Elfrid Payton, Darius Miller and Ian Clark \u2014 to go after a high-profile free agent in the summer of 2019 to play alongside Davis and Jrue Holiday. 9f) Davis is, as of now, open minded about potentially staying. But, obviously, next summer is crucial. The Pelicans will have to add another difference maker, or the clock that is already ticking will start to sound like a gong in the Big Easy. It looked like the 18 (!)-year vet was on his way to Philadelphia late in the offseason. But the 76ers weren\u2019t able to move veteran Jerryd Bayless, which would have opened a roster spot for the 38-year-old Crawford. Now, it\u2019s likely Crawford \u2014 who stays in ridiculously good shape \u2014 will have to wait for a long-term injury to a guard somewhere before he gets signed again. You know what you\u2019re getting with JCrossover: a guy who can still get his off the bench, and can still get as hot as anybody quickly. What was all the rage just a few years ago in the Association \u2014 giving all the power in an organization to the head coach \u2014 has crashed on the shores, with Minnesota\u2019s Tom Thibodeau the last coach with front office final say as well. In the last few years, Mike Budenholzer (Atlanta), Doc Rivers (Clippers) and Stan Van Gundy (Detroit) all lost their president of basketball operations titles, and only Rivers is still employed as coach. (Milwaukee\u2019s Jason Kidd didn\u2019t have the official title, but had the personnel juice in all but name; he, too, lost both jobs.) Brett Brown could have had it in Philly after former GM Bryan Colangelo\u2019s demise, but walked away from it after being the team\u2019s interim executive this summer. No. It\u2019s fair to think there will be regression. This season will mark the first in two decades that Gregg Popovich hasn\u2019t had any of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili \u2014 his soon-to-be Hall of Fame triumvirate \u2014 on the floor to keep things calm and moving. The Spurs now have to build new memories and count on different people. So, while they have two All-Stars in LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan to build around, and some promising young talent, including Dejounte Murray and first-rounder Lonnie Walker, it\u2019s just going to take time for all of it to jell. Popovich is too good a coach to have it all fall apart, and San Antonio will still make the playoffs, but the championship contender days are likely over for a spell. The Suns want Ayton, first, to anchor their sieve-like defense (DFL in the league last season in Defensive Rating, at 110.6, and opponent points allowed (113.3), 26th in opponent 3-point percentage (.373) and 22nd in the league in points allowed in the paint\/game (47.1). He\u2019ll be tasked with at least cutting off opponent traipses to the front of the rim. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart player so he has picked up our defensive concepts quickly,\u201d GM Ryan McDonough said over the weekend. \u201cOffensively, he has a great touch on his shot but we will use him more as a screen and roll guy early in his career.\u201d Eventually, Phoenix expects Ayton to be a monster a la Clint Capela in rim runs, both in the halfcourt and in transition. But a low double-double average (12 points, 10 rebounds) per night would be just fine for now. Some of us like Collin Sexton a whole, whole lot, so if nothing else, enjoy watching the Cavs\u2019 first-round pick do work. And, there\u2019s too much pride and institutional memory from among Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and others for Cleveland to collapse completely. But: mainly, just enjoy Sexton getting better. I think there\u2019s a better chance of him staying in Charlotte than others seem to believe. The main reason is, simply, volume \u2014 just about every team in the league has either a proven, veteran point guard already in place, or has a young guy it expects to be the leading man in due course. Of the other 29 teams in the league, I\u2019d say 16 have someone already in that role who\u2019s either an All-Star, All-Star caliber, or high-priced guy the Hornets probably wouldn\u2019t want in return at the point \u2014 Boston (Kyrie Irving), Detroit (Reggie Jackson), Miami (Goran Dragic), Milwaukee (Eric Bledsoe), Philadelphia (Ben Simmons), Toronto (Kyle Lowry), Washington (John Wall), Denver (Gary Harris), Golden State (Steph Curry), Houston (Chris Paul), Memphis (Mike Conley, Jr.), Minnesota (Jeff Teague), New Orleans (Jrue Holiday), Oklahoma City (Russell Westbrook), Portland (Damian Lillard) and Utah (Ricky Rubio). Another nine teams have drafted or traded for their point guard of the future in the last couple of years: Atlanta (Trae Young), Chicago (Kris Dunn), Cleveland (Collin Sexton), New York (Frank Ntilikina), Dallas (Dennis Smith, Jr.), the Lakers (Lonzo Ball), Phoenix (Devin Booker), Sacramento (De\u2019Aaron Fox) and San Antonio (Dejounte Murray). That leaves Brooklyn, Indiana, the Clippers and Orlando as possible long-term destinations for a point guard next summer \u2014 and Brooklyn and the Clippers certainly will have the desire and cap space to go after a player of Walker\u2019s caliber. But he won\u2019t be a free agent in a vacuum; the Nets and Clips plan to be major players for all the other top free agents as well as Walker. Doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t go to either, and the Hornets will surely have their antennae up all season. But Michael Jordan is well aware of how difficult it will be to get free agents to come to Charlotte \u2014 and, certainly, how much harder that would be without a high-caliber player like Walker to play alongside. Just have a hunch that things might get worked out down there. Otto Porter has shot 43 and 44 percent the last two seasons on 3-pointers for Washington. The Wizards were tied for third in the league in 3-point percentage last season, making 37.5 percent of their shots behind the arc. Yet Washington was just 23rd in the league in 3-point attempts, shooting just 26.5 per game. By contrast, Houston took more than 42 3s a night last season. Porter shot 50 percent overall last season, after shooting 51 percent in 2016-17. He is a shotmaker. Yet he only 4.1 3-point attempts last season, and just 11.5 shots overall. The Wizards\u2019 best chance of being the four-out, one-in offense that most of the elite teams in the league have perfected lies with Brooks getting his 25-year-old three, who\u2019s making $27 million a year, the rock a lot more. A whole lot more. Luka Doncic and Trae Young will be linked for the entirety of their respective NBA careers, having essentially been traded for one another on Draft night. Doncic has advantages playing in Dallas that Young doesn\u2019t have in Atlanta; he\u2019ll be playing with an emerging star point guard in Dennis Smith, Jr., while Young is the point guard in Atlanta, who has to get others going before he starts looking for his own shot. And the Mavericks have many more proven pieces to surround him than the Hawks have with Young. So it\u2019s very likely Doncic\u2019s first-year numbers will be much better. Yes \u2014 assuming Paul Millsap is healthy most of the season. There\u2019s just too much talent here, and too much of a bad taste from the last game of the season loss last year, for the Nuggets not to break through and get back to the postseason for the first time in six years. (Not to mention that the Wolves, depending on how the Butler situation is resolved, may well take a giant step back in the West.) He will be great. Not good \u2014 great. And if ESPN\/ABC has any sense, it will team Stan with Jeff on one of its broadcast teams, and move Mark Jackson, who\u2019s paired with Jeff Van Gundy on the network\u2019s lead team the last few years, to another team. Please know that this would not be, to me, a demotion of any kind for Jackson, who\u2019s been a strong analyst since coming to TV. But putting Jeff and Stan Van Gundy together for broadcasts is simply a no-brainer. Having spoken with both of them numerous times over the years, I think their vocal inflections are different enough that you would know which one was talking \u2014 yelling \u2014 at the other during games. They\u2019re both smart, sarcastic, and know how to push each other\u2019s buttons, as all brothers do. It would be Must See TV every week. Borrego has the *asterisk by his name because, technically, he did mop up as an interim coach (30 games) in Orlando in 2015 after the Magic fired Jacque Vaughn. For our purposes, though, he\u2019ll be considered a rookie head coach. But of those four, Kokoskov has the resume that points to being outstanding as the top guy. He\u2019s got so much experience both internationally as a head coach and in the NBA as an assistant for six teams. He\u2019s great with people and will put the Suns in good, creative offensive sets. Phoenix got this one right. Yes. Yes, they will. No. No, they won\u2019t. East: Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, Indiana, Milwaukee, Washington, Detroit, Miami. West: Golden State, Houston, Oklahoma City, Utah, Denver, Memphis, L.A. Lakers, San Antonio. First round: Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, Indiana; Golden State, Houston, OKC, Utah. Conference semis: Boston, Philly; Golden State, Oklahoma City Conference finals: Boston over Philly; Golden State over Oklahoma City NBA Finals: Golden State over Boston, seven games. As ever, 24 is not in honor of Jack Bauer , but Danny Biasone, the late owner of the Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers), who came up with the notion of a 24-second shot clock in 1954, at a time when NBA games didn\u2019t have a time limit on offensive possessions \u2014 and teams often held the ball for minutes at a time, to lessen the impact of talent disadvantages. (The Minneapolis Lakers\u2019 George Mikan, the league\u2019s first superstar, was running roughshod over the NBA at the time, and most teams had no one who could stop him.) At the owners\u2019 meetings that year, Biasone did the math. NBA games were 48 minutes long. In a normal, non-slowdown game, Biasone figured out that around 120 shots \u2014 60 per team \u2014 were taken. So, if you divided the number of seconds in a game \u2014 2,880 \u2014 by the number of shots, 120, you could come up with a time limit per possession for each team. And 2,880 divided by 120 is 24. The 24-second shot clock saved the league. Scoring went up the next season with the implementation of the clock, as teams began pushing the pace of play to keep up. Soon after, the Celtics, with Bob Cousy running the show, introduced the fast break as a weapon and started winning championships. The 24-second clock made the NBA a fast league, and made great athletes a necessity. And that made the NBA a league that would appeal to younger fans. It still is."},{"id":46710,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/30-teams-30-days-houston-rockets","date":"2018-09-30","title":"30 Teams in 30 Days: Houston Rockets make key addition in pursuit of NBA title","content":" What offseason?  That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s team:  Houston Rockets 2017-18 Record:  65-17, lost in Western Conference finals to Golden State Warriors Who\u2019s new:  Carmelo Anthony (free agency), Michael Carter-Williams (free agency), Marquese Chriss (trade), Brandon Knight (trade) Who\u2019s gone:  Trevor Ariza (free agency), Luc Mbah a Moute (free agency) The lowdown: Flush with a desire to finish with the best record in the West and gain home-court advantage in the playoffs, the Rockets went one better, getting the best record in the NBA and franchise history . New arrival Chris Paul was a static-free compliment to James Harden, who averaged 30.4 points and 8.8 assists per game (first and third overall in the league) and won Kia MVP honors . Just as anticipated, Paul provided the intangibles that were missing from Rockets\u2019 teams in the past, like leadership and late-game smarts. The Rockets didn\u2019t have players that fit the definition of a \u201cBig Three\u201d, but center Clint Capela created a debate about that by averaging nearly 14 points and 11 rebounds per game and providing solid rim protection. Finally, Eric Gordon was a contender for the Kia Sixth Man Award once again. The fairy tale had a horrific ending, though, when Paul suffered a hamstring injury in Game 5 of the West finals against the Warriors as Houston squandered a 3-2 series lead . The best trait of Rockets GM Daryl Money is his risk-taking and desire to keep the Rockets rolling in the Harden era. When his addition of Dwight Howard years ago didn\u2019t work out, he brought in Paul. And now he\u2019s gambling on Carmelo\u2019s twilight years and if the former All-Star forward has much ammunition left. It\u2019s not much of a gamble, though, if you have nothing to lose. Adding Anthony didn\u2019t cost the Rockets anything significant after the Atlanta Hawks bought out the final year of his contract days after he was traded there by the Oklahoma City Thunder . The Rockets can only hope \u2018Melo works out better with them than he did in Oklahoma City. There, he brooded about his role and the sacrifices he was asked to make. During his prime with the Nuggets and Knicks, \u2018Melo was a certified scorer who was especially dangerous in isolation situations. In both Denver and New York, the offense centered almost exclusively around him, or at least made him the centerpiece. In OKC, Anthony went from taking 326 shots in isolation situations in 2016-17 to 213 such shots last season . He was often a spot-up shooter and, in some cases, was a decoy in late-game situations. Either \u2018Melo was being slighted, as he felt, or after 15 years in the NBA and a pair of knee \u2018scopes, \u2018Melo was simply feeling his age. The truth will surface in Houston, because the Rockets bring two players (Harden and Paul) who can share the ball as well as score. Plus, coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system is designed to take full advantage of each player\u2019s offensive skillset. Basically, this is Anthony\u2019s best chance to grab that elusive championship. Does he kill the perception of him being a selfish scorer (fair or not), or feed it? Anthony\u2019s reunion with D\u2019Antoni is a curious one as the two men butted heads in New York, a confrontation that ultimately led to D\u2019Antoni resigning as Knicks coach . D\u2019Antoni wants \u2018Melo to adjust to the times, reality and his surroundings and fit in rather than pout. It\u2019s possible Anthony might be asked to come off the bench, a notion he laughed off time and again in OKC . The Rockets have something else working in their favor: Paul is good friends with Anthony and should help the transition go a lot smoother than it did for the Thunder. If he accepts a role that suits the Rockets, Anthony can find his shots and his rhythm. He can still score ( as his 16.2 ppg in OKC proves ) and, if nothing else, Anthony will create space for Harden, Paul and Capela. \u2018Melo became necessary after the Rockets lost Ariza in free agency. It was the most perplexing decision of the summer. Why did Ariza leave a team that was a healthy Paul hamstring from possibly going to The Finals (and maybe winning a title) for the Phoenix Suns, a rebuilding team that will be fortunate to win 35 games this season ? New Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said the team had no problem with going into the luxury tax, yet not only did the Rockets lose Ariza, but also Mbah a Moute, another swingman who could hit 3-pointers and defend. Losing both could have consequences for the Rockets defensively, because Anthony isn\u2019t cut from that cloth. To prove as much, the Rockets did give Paul four years and $160 million , a rather generous payday for someone who, while a future Hall of Famer, can\u2019t seem to stay healthy and will turn 34 next spring. Plus, they forked over another fat contract to keep Capela , a restricted free agent now making $90 million over the next five years. Houston\u2019s other summer deals and contract signings were minimal. While the Paul signing was done quickly, talks with Capela lasted weeks because the summer market was a soft one for big men. Still, the Rockets were the best choice for Capela and vice versa \u2014 but much of his impact is due to catching lobs from Paul and Harden? More impressively, Morey finally unloaded Anderson\u2019s clunker contract on the Suns and even managed to grab two players who could help: Chriss and Knight. Chriss never developed in Phoenix, yet he\u2019s only 21 and is athletic. Knight is returning from knee surgery and could provide ball handling relief for Harden and Paul. The challenge of keeping a contender sharp and championship-driven isn\u2019t an easy one, and it\u2019s made more difficult in an era where the Warriors are now throwing five All-Stars on the floor with the addition of DeMarcus Cousins. Morey and the Rockets certainly had a chore this summer. Yet give them this: Houston should serve once again as the sternest test for the Warriors, at least in the West, this season. With good health \u2014 looking at you, Paul \u2014 and a rejuvenated Anthony, the Rockets get have exactly what they\u2019re asking for: A chance. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Their All-Star starting backcourt of DeRozan and Kyle Lowry never looked better together, and DeRozan, who improved as a 3-point shooter, made All-NBA. But the success of the Raptors was tied to the supporting help; the rotation went 10-deep, giving Casey plenty of options depending on the nightly matchup. For his efforts in diversifying the offense, Casey would win Coach of the Year . However, once again the playoffs, and LeBron James in particular, proved to be the Raptors\u2019 unraveling, with grave results this time. Getting bounced in a sweep led to massive changes. Casey was fired and the front office decided to break up the backcourt, with DeRozan shipped to the Spurs for Leonard in what was the summer\u2019s biggest swap. The shakeup didn\u2019t exactly weaken the Raptors much if at all on paper, however, and the Raptors exited the offseason with justifiable hope for better results next spring. For a few turbulent weeks, Masai Ujiri must\u2019ve felt like a punching bag for the first time in his charmed NBA career. The former Executive of the Year, widely hailed as one of the brightest front office minds in the game, was questioned by critics, heard doubts in Toronto and got the cold shoulder from the most popular player in town. Make that ex-player: DeRozan was sent, kicking and screaming, to San Antonio, when all he wanted to do was spend the rest of his career in Toronto. You can blame it on LeBron, who stole Toronto\u2019s soul in the playoffs with big performances and a game-winner that all but forced Ujiri to press the red button. Rather than wait until after next season, with LeBron headed out of the East, before making any wholesale changes, the general manager decided to be proactive. Yes, he could\u2019ve kept the Raptors intact with good reason; after all, they did nearly win 60 games and there\u2019s no shame in losing a series to LeBron, who wouldn\u2019t be around to spook them anymore anyway. But Casey was fired in a move that surprised the league only because his work in 2017-18 was largely stellar. He drew the respect of his peers and was admired in Toronto and also checked his ego by refining his system to become more player-friendly. Casey\u2019s downfall was directly tied to the playoffs series with Cleveland. The Raptors blew a big Game 1 lead and then didn\u2019t show up in Game 4 where they lost by 35. The game before, LeBron sank a buzzer-beating, winning one-hander when the Raptors didn\u2019t double on the play, which wasn\u2019t a good look. Game 3 also spelled doom for DeRozan, who was benched in the fourth quarter after shooting three-for-12 with eight points. It was unusual to see a team\u2019s leading scorer yanked in a playoff game and maybe that entered into Ujiri\u2019s think-tank. Nonetheless, DeRozan would likely still be in Toronto today if not for the Kawhi-fueled drama in San Antonio, which led to the star being shopped for the highest price. It was an opportunity that Ujiri couldn\u2019t pass up, even with no assurance that Leonard would be anything more than a one-year rental. Leonard missed virtually all of last season with a quad strain that confounded the Spurs and led to a level of distrust between the player (or his \u201cpeople\u201d according to coach Gregg Popovich) and the Spurs\u2019 medical staff. The quiet star never said a word, although his actions spoke for him; Kawhi didn\u2019t bother sitting on the bench for the Spurs\u2019 playoff games and mainly elected to stay in New York rehabbing. Also, word is Leonard preferred to play for the hometown Lakers or Clippers and becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer, raising the possibility that Toronto is just a stopover. None of this spooked Ujiri, who made the trade anyway, risking the disappointment of Lowry and the anger of DeRozan, who is mentioned with Vince Carter as the best player in franchise history. From a popularity standpoint, this wasn\u2019t the best move, especially factoring in Kawhi\u2019s pending free agency. Yet strictly on talent, there\u2019s no comparison. Leonard is one of the game\u2019s finest two-way players and still in his prime. He outplayed LeBron in a championship series, improved his shooting range and is without peer as a lockdown defender in today\u2019s NBA. Also, until last season, he was as low-maintenance as it gets in professional sports. Most likely, the Raptors will get the best of Kawhi, because there\u2019s every reason for him to play well here in his walk year. And if that\u2019s the case, the Raptors will be in the mix for the East title. The deal also sent Poeltl to the Spurs and Green to the Raptors. After being a mild disappointment, Poeltl began to gain confidence last season and the seven-footer was vital off the bench. Green will instantly help the Raptors\u2019 ball-spacing with his three-point shooting, and as a bonus, Green is aggressive defensively. Nurse assumes the coaching job, and this was a curious decision, considering he was Casey\u2019s lead assistant. Nurse won\u2019t need to change much, considering Casey\u2019s system won 59 games, and the best news is the new coach doesn\u2019t need to worry about LeBron. These were potential franchise-changing moves made by Ujiri no matter what happens. If they work, Toronto is playing for a title next summer. If they don\u2019t, Toronto will be ready to rebuild.

Today, we look at the Dallas Mavericks, who couldn\u2019t match up with their opponents\u2019 best. The Mavs\u2019 most-used lineup \u2013 Dennis Smith, Wesley Matthews, Harrison Barnes, Maxi Kleber and Dirk Nowitzki \u2013 was outscored by 14.8 points per 100 possessions. That was the worst mark (by a wide margin) among 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes together . In total, the Mavs\u2019 lineup was outscored by 93 points, the worst raw plus-minus among all lineups last season . And you don\u2019t rack up a minus-93 in 271 minutes without problems on both ends of the floor. On offense, the lineup had an effective field goal percentage of just 49.5 percent, the third worst mark among the 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes . It shot poorly from the outside, and it didn\u2019t get to the basket or to the free throw line enough\u2026 On defense, the Mavs\u2019 most-used lineup allowed an effective field goal percentage of 57.3 percent, the third highest opponent mark among the 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes . It also forced a paltry 10.7 turnovers per 100 possessions, the third lowest mark among that same group . Now, the Kleber lineup only played in 29 of the Mavs\u2019 82 games. So it wasn\u2019t that much of a problem by itself. But really, the Mavs\u2019 core starters were generally bad together. The Mavs were outscored by 11.7 points per 100 possessions in 1,257 total minutes with Smith, Matthews and Barnes on the floor. That on-court NetRtg was more than twice as bad as any three-man combination that played at least 1,000 minutes together , and the trio\u2019s raw plus-minus of minus-288 was the worst for three-man combinations by another huge margin . Smith, Matthews and Barnes aren\u2019t the three worst players in the league by any stretch, but going against opposing starting lineups, they just couldn\u2019t match up. Smith has incredible bounce and helped the Mavs get to the basket more than they did before he arrived. But his effective field goal percentage of 34.6 percent on pull-up jumpers ranked 90th among 95 players who attempted at least 200 . His overall effective field goal percentage of 44.6 percent ranked last among the 36 players with at least 1,000 field goal attempts . Barnes\u2019 effective field goal percentage of 49.4 percent ranked 29th among those 36 players. The percentage of his shots that came from the restricted area or 3-point range were up from his first season in Dallas, but was still well below the league average. Matthews was slightly more efficient, but still below the league average in regard to both effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage. And with those three guys on the floor, the Mavs allowed 113.0 points allowed per 100 possessions, a rate which would have ranked last in the league defensively. Though the Mavericks\u2019 starters couldn\u2019t match up with those of their opponents, the team had some success with its second unit. Quite a bit, actually. The Mavs built a bench around Nowitzki, who has started 1,575 of the last 1,583 games of his career (since being moved into the starting lineup late in his rookie season), but usually checked out five minutes into the first and third quarters, checking back in to start the second and fourth to play alongside the reserves. And that\u2019s when the Mavs were at their best. Dallas outscored its opponents by 19.1 points per 100 possessions in 326 total minutes with J.J. Barea, Yogi Ferrell, Nowitzki and Dwight Powell on the floor with either Devin Harris (prior to the Feb. 8 trade that sent him to Denver) or Doug McDermott (after he arrived in the same deal). So while Nowitzki doesn\u2019t move very well anymore, the Mavs were still able to build a successful lineup around him. And it was actually best on the defensive end of the floor (in part because it played against other reserves). The Harris lineup allowed just 93.9 points per 100 possessions in its 231 minutes, the best DefRtg among the 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes together . It was also one of two lineups that played 200 minutes or more and recorded assists on at least 70 percent of its field goals . Nowitzki will \u201clikely\u201d come off the bench this season , and that should be a relatively easy transition given last year\u2019s substitution pattern. Ferrell is gone from that second unit, but Harris is back (via free agency) and will re-unite with Barea, Nowitzki and Powell. More good news is that the Mavs seem to have upgraded their starting lineup, with the additions of DeAndre Jordan and Luka Doncic, along with the development of Smith. Jordan will get them more shots in the restricted area, Doncic will allow Barnes to play more off the ball, and Smith should be a better shooter off the dribble after a summer of work. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the San Antonio Spurs, who saw the league\u2019s biggest regression in the most important part of the game. The Spurs saw the league\u2019s biggest drop in effective field goal percentage, from 52.4 percent ( 10th in the league ) in \u201916-17 to 50.7 percent ( 26th ) last season. On each side of the floor, there are \u201cfour factors\u201d to efficiency: Shooting, free throws, turnovers and rebounds. And by far, shooting is the most important of the four. So along with the drop in effective field goal percentage, the Spurs saw a big drop in overall efficiency, scoring 3.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did the season prior . That drop resulted in the Spurs\u2019 first below-average offensive season in the last 10 years (since the 2007-08 season). The Spurs had, amazingly, ranked in the top 10 in effective field goal percentage for 13 straight seasons. And last season, they dropped to 26th. They actually improved their shot profile last season, taking more shots from the most efficient spots on the floor. They took 29 percent of their shots from the restricted area, up from 28 percent in 2016-17. And after two seasons in which they took more mid-range shots than 3-pointers, they cut down on the mid-range attempts (from 30 percent of their shots to 25 percent). But they shot worse from every area except the restricted area. And it was from beyond the arc where they really fell off. After leading the league in 3-point percentage (39.1 percent) in \u201916-17 , they ranked 26th (35.2 percent) last season . That drop was the biggest in the last four seasons (since the Philadelphia 76ers saw a drop from 36.0 percent to 31.2 percent in the first year of \u201cThe Process\u201d). And though the Spurs saw a small increase in the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range, they still ranked 27th in that regard . The New York Knicks (27th, 29th) were the only other team that ranked in the bottom five in both 3-point percentage and the percentage of shots that came from 3-point range. Pau Gasol shot 36 percent from 3-point range, down from 54 percent last season . Gasol wasn\u2019t a high-volume shooter (just 224 attempts total over those two seasons) and the 54 percent was unsustainable, but that was the biggest drop in 3-point percentage among 183 players who attempted at least 100 threes each season. Manu Ginobili (from 39 percent to 33 percent) and Rudy Gay (from 37 percent with Sacramento to 31 percent) saw the 15th and 16th biggest drop, respectively, among that same group. And of course, the Spurs played most of last season without their MVP candidate from the season before. Kawhi Leonard didn\u2019t shoot nearly as well from 3-point range in 2016-17 ( 38.0 percent ) as he did when he ranked third in the league (44.3 percent) in \u201915-16 . But the 38.0 percent was better than the league average (35.8 percent), and Leonard shot at a fairly high volume (5.2 attempts per game). Leonard ranked just 36th with 124 assists on 3-pointers in \u201916-17 (LeBron James assisted on almost three times as many), but his teammates did shoot 43 percent from 3-point range off his passes . Without him last season, the Spurs had one fewer shooter and one fewer playmaker. DeMar DeRozan now arrives with the ability to fill the latter role. Though DeRozan did see huge increase in the percentage of his shots that came from 3-point range last season ( to 20.3 percent from 8.0 percent in \u201916-17 ), he still shot just 31 percent from beyond the arc . But DeRozan did rank seventh last season with 201 assists on 3-pointers (up from 132 \u2013 29th \u2013 in \u201916-17), with his teammates shooting 37.1 percent (a little better than the league average) from beyond the arc off his passes . The Spurs also (essentially) swapped Danny Green (sent to Toronto with Leonard) for Marco Belinelli (brought back in free agency after three years away). Both are thought of as shooters, but at 35.7 percent and 35.1 percent, they rank 96th and 112th in 3-point percentage among 153 players with at least 500 3-point attempts over the last three years. Belinelli could help the offense with more movement, but Green will be missed on the other end of the floor. If the Spurs finally take a step back defensively, they\u2019ll need to find ways to shoot better to keep their 21-year playoff streak alive. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Houston Rockets, who were iso-heavy \u2026 on both ends of the floor. The Rockets scored 1.12 points per possession on isolations , by far the highest rate in 14 seasons on play-type tracking by Synergy. The only other team over those 14 seasons to crack a point per possession was last season\u2019s LA Clippers, who scored 721 points on 719 isolations (1.003 per). The Rockets have brought back iso-ball. Not only did they set a record for isolation efficiency, but they isolated on 14.5 percent of their possessions , the highest rate of the last five seasons, with the 2012-13 New York Knicks (15.6 percent) being the last team to top it. Isolation rates were much higher in years prior to that. The 2005-06 Lakers isolated on 20 percent of their possessions and there were 11 other teams that season that isolated at a higher rate than last season\u2019s Rockets. In the each of the first nine seasons of Synergy play-type tracking (2004-05 through 2012-13), there were between 15-28 teams that isolated on at least 10 percent of their possessions. Then, in 2013-14 (the season the Spurs won the championship by eviscerating the Miami Heat\u2019s aggressive defense with ball movement), there was a drop to just six teams that isolated on at least 10 percent of their possessions. The number dropped to four teams in 2014-15 and a low of just one team (the Lakers) in 2015-16 . But iso-ball may be making a comeback. And the Rockets are leading the way. In the 14 years of Synergy tracking, Houston was the third team to rank first in both the percentage of their possessions that were isolations and points per possession on isolation possessions, joining the 2006-07 Lakers and the \u201916-17 Cavs . James Harden, of course, was the leader of the isolation parade. He averaged twice as many points per game on isolations (12.2) as any other player in the league , because he led in the league in both isolations per game (10.0) and in points per possession on isolations (1.22). And he led by wide margins in both cases. Harden\u2019s 10.0 isolations per game were an increase from 6.8 in 2016-17. Chris Paul saw a similar jump, from 3.0 isolations per game in his final season with the LA Clippers to 5.1 ( fourth in the league ) last season. Paul was similarly efficient both seasons, scoring 1.09 points per isolation ( third in the league among players with at least two isolations per game ) in \u201916-17 and 1.10 ( second behind Harden ) last season. Harden, though, went from scoring 0.97 to 1.22. Harden not only shot much better than he did the season before, but he also got to the line more often, and saw a dramatic drop in turnover rate on isolations. The frequency with which the Rockets isolated was partially dependent on the defense. They were more likely to isolate against switching defenses than they were against opponents that didn\u2019t switch often. Of course, the Rockets themselves switched screens often. As a result, 11.2 percent of their opponents\u2019 possessions were isolations, and that was the league\u2019s highest opponent rate . They defended those isolations well, allowing just 0.84 points per possession, the league\u2019s sixth best mark. The iso-fest hit a peak in the conference finals, where the Rockets met the team that ranked second in regard to the percentage of opponent possessions that were isolations . The Rockets and Golden State Warriors both saw increases, on both ends of the floor, in isolations in the postseason . Houston ranked last in ball movement (295 passes per 24 minutes of possession) and 29th in player movement (9.8 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession) in the regular season and saw drops in both marks (to 247 and 9.3) in the playoffs. Paul was even more efficient on isolations in the playoffs (1.17 points per possession), though he saw a small drop in volume (to just 5.0 per game ). Harden saw an increase in volume (to 12.9 isos per game), but a drop-off in efficiency (1.00 points per possession). And of course, without Paul in Games 6 and 7 against the champs, the Rockets couldn\u2019t hold on. There\u2019s a (fairly universal) belief that the departures of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute will hurt the defense that ranked sixth in the league . Houston had one or both on the floor for 86 percent of their minutes last season, so there\u2019s definitely a void to be filled. But neither Ariza nor Mbah a Moute was a high-volume isolation defender. According to Synergy, it was Clint Capela, Ryan Anderson (also gone) and Harden who were isolated against most last season . And the results when those guys had to defend one-on-one were pretty good. The results on the other end of the floor were even better. And with Harden and Paul owed a combined $360 million over the next five seasons, the Rockets are betting that those historic isolation numbers are sustainable. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

The critical process of familiarization and integration will speed up over the next week, in the form of a trip to California to continue training camp and play a couple of exhibition games while Jimmy Butler\u2019s unresolved trade request looms in the background. The Timberwolves will be out of town for seven days, a prime time for bonding. \u201cThey can spend a lot of time together. We\u2019ll have good practices, some film sessions, some team dinners, so I think it\u2019s good,\u201d coach Tom Thibodeau said Thursday, before the traveling party boarded a plane for the Bay Area. The Wolves play the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors on Saturday night. With draft picks Josh Okogie and Keita Bates-Diop and veterans Anthony Tolliver and Luol Deng, the Wolves will sport a significantly different look to their bench. When \u2014 or if, as Thibodeau has insisted \u2014 the Butler deal goes down, the freshness factor of the roster will only increase. \u201cNot a new team, but damn near a new team,\u201d said Andrew Wiggins, who has had Derrick Rose next to him on the wing instead of Butler with the first unit with Jeff Teague at point guard and Taj Gibson and Karl-Anthony Towns in the frontcourt. Deng, who signed with the Wolves just 2 1\/2 weeks ago after being let go by the Los Angeles Lakers, doesn\u2019t figure to factor heavily in the rotation as his 15th year in the league unfolds. Thibodeau wouldn\u2019t have added him, though, if he didn\u2019t plan to use him some.  \u201cI\u2019m happy just to be back playing, night in and night out. I have an opportunity,\u201d Deng said. \u201cLast year I was told from the start of the season that I wasn\u2019t going to play. So it\u2019s a different fire.\u201d Another or player or two would likely be moved along with Butler to consummate such a blockbuster trade, creating another level of uncertainty surrounding the club with the season opener fast approaching on Oct. 17. Backup center Gorgui Dieng, who has three years left on his contract at an annual average of $15.7 million, would certainly be a candidate for salary-cap relief. Still, most of the players have expressed a nonchalant attitude toward the absence of Butler, the four-time All-Star who helped shepherd the Wolves to the playoffs last spring to snap a 13-year streak of sitting out. \u201cAll we can do is come in here and hoop, play hard, stay competitive and try to win,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cThe rest of that is up to the coaches, GM, owner, all that.\u201d The rookies Okogie and Bates-Diop have been undergoing a big adjustment, moving from the college game to the pros. Tolliver has to learn Thibodeau\u2019s system, style and expectations. Wiggins, though, has an equally weighty task of asserting himself as more of a go-to player. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. When you don\u2019t have a guy like Jimmy out there, the workload\u2019s going to get even harder for you,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cBut I felt like Wig did a good job last year, especially when Jimmy went down.\u201d Through three days of training camp, at least, Wiggins has begun to do just that. \u201cDemanding the ball, hitting great shots, being real physical,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThat\u2019s things we all count on him doing.\u201d"},{"id":38521,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-oklahoma-city-thunder-andre-roberson-defense","date":"2018-09-28","title":"One Team, One Stat: Oklahoma City Thunder defense suffers without Andre Roberson","content":" NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann gets you ready for the 2018-19 season with a key stat for each team in the league and shows you why it matters. Today, we look at the Oklahoma City Thunder, who lost a critical piece to their defense in late January. The Thunder were 11.2 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Andre Roberson on the floor (allowing 96.4) than they were with him off the floor (107.6). That was the biggest on-off DefRtg differential among 266 players who played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team last season. On-off differential requires context. It\u2019s about a player\u2019s ability, but also about who he\u2019s on the floor with, both his teammates and the opponents, and who\u2019s out of the game when he\u2019s in. Three of the guys in the top five of on-off DefRtg differential \u2013 Roberson, Jrue Holiday and Robert Covington \u2013 are clearly impact defenders. The other two \u2013 Kyle Korver and Yogi Ferrell \u2013 probably benefit some from being reserves and playing against opposing second units that aren\u2019t as strong offensively as starting groups. Though Roberson was a starter, he had the benefit of playing 92 percent of his minutes with Russell Westbrook , 75 percent of his minutes with Steven Adams, and 74 percent of his minutes with Paul George. But the Thunder starting lineup with Roberson in it was much better defensively than the other four guys playing alongside somebody else. Roberson is thought of as an offensive liability. In more than 1,000 minutes last season, he took just 39 shots from outside the restricted area and made just eight (21 percent) of the 39 . (The season prior, he shot just 25 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the third worst mark among 200 players who attempted at least 100 .) But the Thunder were only slightly better when the other four starters shared the floor with somebody else than they were when Roberson was the fifth guy on the floor, in part because they didn\u2019t depend on half-court offense as much as most teams did, with Roberson finding ways to contribute. Oklahoma City led the league on both points off turnovers (18.7 per game) and second chance points (14.9 per game). That accounted for 31 percent, the league\u2019s highest rate, of their scoring. Both George (2.0, 3.9) and Westbrook (1.8, 3.3) ranked in the top five in steals per game and in the top seven in deflections per game . But OKC\u2019s opponent turnover rate was highest (18.9 per 100 possessions) with Roberson on the floor . Adams ranked third in offensive rebounding percentage , grabbing 16 percent of available offensive boards while he was on the floor. But Roberson\u2019s offensive rebounding percentage of 7.8 percent ranked fourth among 175 players 6-8 or shorter who played at least 1,000 minutes last season. And like their opponents\u2019 turnover rate, the Thunder\u2019s offensive rebounding percentage was highest with Roberson on the floor . Among 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes together, the Thunder\u2019s starting lineup \u2013 Westbrook, Roberson, George, Carmelo Anthony and Adams \u2013 ranked first in opponent turnover rate (19.2 per 100 possessions) and second in offensive rebounding percentage (grabbing 33 percent of available offensive boards) . So, while only one of the five guys (George) had an effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint that was above the league average, the lineup was solid offensively. And with an elite defense, it outscored its opponents by 14.1 points per 100 possessions, the eighth best mark among 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes together . When Roberson was lost for the season (on Jan. 27) to a knee injury, the Thunder ranked fifth defensively , having allowed 103.1 points allowed per 100 possessions. They ranked 15th defensively from that point on , allowing 107.0. If he\u2019s healthy this season, the Thunder defense should be back in the top 10 \u2026 and the offense won\u2019t suffer as much as you might think. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team:  Golden State Warriors 2017-18 Record:  58-24 ( defeated Cleveland Cavaliers in NBA Finals ) Who\u2019s new:  DeMarcus Cousins (free agency); Jonas Jerebko (free agency); Jacob Evans (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  JaVale McGee; Zaza Pachulia; Nick Young; David West The lowdown: The dominance of the Warriors continued with their third championship in four years and fourth straight trip to The Finals, although to nitpick, the journey wasn\u2019t without a few sharp turns. Mostly, the Warriors dodged a bullet when Chris Paul\u2019s hamstring pull prevented him from finishing the West finals , where the Rockets were in control at the time. Also, the Warriors at times staggered through the regular season, often drawing the anger of coach Steve Kerr, although they won 58 games anyway, proof of their sheer talent. In the end, the Warriors and their overload of stars were too much for anyone to overcome, especially LeBron James in The Finals. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, two elite players in their prime, remained at the top of their game, with Draymond Green and Klay Thompson providing the necessary support. Andre Iguodala showed declining skills and Young was a disappointment as the Warriors\u2019 bench delivered mixed results. Still, the NBA season ended exactly how many anticipated, with the Warriors nourishing a basketball dynasty that\u2019s already one of the best ever. As if four All-Stars and at least two future Hall of Famers weren\u2019t enough, the Warriors added Cousins to the stew this summer and sent a shiver around the league once more. Hilarious, really: While the rest of the NBA title contenders scrambled to make changes this summer in an attempt to overthrow Golden State, the champs distanced themselves from the pack with a checkmate move . Obviously, getting a four-time All-Star center was dictated by unusual circumstances. Any visions of getting big money in free agency this summer vaporized after Cousins\u2019 Achilles injury last spring; therefore, if forced to sign a short-term deal, he figured, why not do that with the defending champs? Makes sense. This is the second time in recent history that a serious injury worked in Golden State\u2019s favor. Six years ago Curry dealt with recurring ankle sprains, so he signed a team-friendly contract that eventually allowed the Warriors to afford Iguodala and add other pieces to jump-start the dynasty. By the time that contract ended, and two Kia MVPs later, Curry was the fourth highest-paid on his own team. Cousins\u2019 own team, the Pelicans, flourished without him late last season and into the playoffs and therefore were understandably hesitant to give him a max contract. Big men dealing with that injury almost never return to form, and anyway, rehab projections had Cousins sitting out nearly all of 2018-19. It didn\u2019t make fiscal sense for the Pelicans or anyone else to pay Cousins big money for a \u201clost\u201d year with another two or three years remaining on the deal without knowing anything about his recovery. Before the injury, Cousins had few peers among centers who could match his pure skills, especially offensively. With a gentle touch around the rim and 3-point range, Cousins was a tough assignment, and he was also solid on the glass and defensively at times. The only downside was his on-court immaturity; he racked up technicals and suspensions through much of his career although he softened noticeably during his time in New Orleans. Much of his frustrations could be blamed on being in Sacramento and never making the playoffs. That said, Cousins did beef with Durant last season and even hunted down KD after a game, which means Cousins still keeps a mean streak. This should make an interesting time in Golden State with Green, who\u2019s cut from the same cloth. The beauty of signing Cousins is the Warriors don\u2019t need him for the regular season. They\u2019re built to win 55-65 games without him. He can rehab without urgency and stay fresh until the playoffs. Basically, he\u2019s a bonus, and if all goes well, will cause opponents to frantically redo their Warriors scouting reports in April. In the past, the Warriors kept a supply of centers who could be generously classified as ornaments. Although McGee played well in The Finals against the Cavs, and Andrew Bogut did contribute to a degree to the Warriors\u2019 first title (and his Finals injury two years ago perhaps cost the Warriors another title), those centers were on the bench when it counted. Cousins represents something bold and different. Assuming good health, he can stretch the floor or become the Warriors\u2019 first legit low-post threat in the Kerr era. That\u2019s why the rest of the league suffered from bad body language when Cousins signed. With their first-round pick, the Warriors took Evans, who helped Cincinnati to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament and brings length and size (6-foot-6) at guard. He\u2019ll immediately become the next project for the Warriors\u2019 player development program, following Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell and Patrick McCaw (who remains unsigned). Jerebko brings additional 3-point shooting and athleticism to the front line; he was productive in previous stops in Boston and Utah. Cousins\u2019 stay with the Warriors could be brief if he plays well, simply because the Warriors can\u2019t pay everyone. Still, another championship for the Warriors, and a first one for Cousins, would benefit everyone involved .

One carries implications for this season, the other impacts next season and beyond. It\u2019s really that simple for the Warriors, the heavy NBA favorites who once again are threatening to burst everyone else\u2019s balloon for the next seven months and then pop bottles in June. While his new teammates are busy breaking a sweat in Camp Kerr, Cousins is mostly off to the side of the court, on his own schedule, going through the next phase of his rehabilitation from a torn Achilles suffered last spring. There is no timetable on his debut. Still: He represents a bonus for the defending champs, an ace card that doesn\u2019t need to be played until it\u2019s time, perhaps around the All-Star break in February, before for the playoffs. It\u2019s quite a luxury to have, for a team that has everything: A big man with skills who averaged 25 points, 13 rebounds and 1.6 blocks last season with the Pelicans and is only 28. Assuming a full recovery, which isn\u2019t a slam dunk by any means, Cousins would still be in his prime once he suits up and makes life complicated for teams trying to game plan for Golden State. And then there\u2019s the elephant in the gym. Durant remains on a year-to-year contract. Initially, this was done mainly to ensure the Warriors wiggle room under the salary cap to re-sign Andre Iguodala and keep the core of a three-time champion. Yet Durant chose the same financial strategy this summer during free agency and therefore will be back on the market in 2019. You ask, and he says only: \u201cJust keeping my options open.\u201d It\u2019s a rather sound, if rare, strategy that\u2019s afforded by only few, as in, just Durant and until this summer, LeBron James. For the superstar who has already banked in excess of $100 million on the court and pulls that much and perhaps more in endorsements, there\u2019s no financial incentive or urgency to lock in long-term. LeBron did so with the Lakers last July only because it was finally the right time: He turns 34 this year. Going year-to-year allows Durant, 30, to stay unchained in case something happens that causes him to sour on the Warriors and\/or fall in love with another team. He\u2019s an MVP contender in his prime and so a long-term deal will always await, no matter if he stays or goes. The only risk is a career-threatening injury, and in such an unlikely yet worst-case scenario. Durant is already wealthy times ten. Flexibility, right now, is more valuable than long-term money. The bigger issue is how this hovers above the Warriors, and there\u2019s no sign that it\u2019s causing sleepless nights. For one: Durant is in the fold for this season and the Warriors remain loaded; therefore their sights are fixated on June, when the championship will be decided, not July, when free agent starts. And two: The organization seems secure in itself and believes at the moment of truth, Golden State will be his best option. The evidence is pretty compelling. Next season the Warriors move into a state-of-the-art arena in San Francisco; ownership is laughing at the luxury tax, which could approach over $150 million in two seasons depending on the payroll; and in case you haven\u2019t noticed, the Warriors are on a championship roll. Finally: Durant enjoys his surroundings. \u201cWe\u2019re selfless, care about each other, that\u2019s what the Warriors do,\u201d he said. \u201cMy cup is full here knowing that you can walk in here and be yourself, no judgment, just all love. The championship is just the cherry on top.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine Durant going to a more talented team. The Warriors are still in their prime, at least the core. Steph Curry is 30 and Durant joins him on Saturday. Cousins, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are 28. It\u2019s rare for a professional sports team to have three titles in the bag with stars in their prime as they chase No. 4; usually, one or two of the main pieces are old and in decline. Extensions are due for Thompson and Cousins next summer along with Durant, and Green in two years. The conventional thinking is a team can\u2019t pay everyone, and perhaps not. But the Warriors will generate millions in their new building, enough to keep a payroll approaching $300 million (and cope with high luxury taxes) if they chose to do so. The goal is to keep the championship train running, until it can\u2019t, because dynasties are hard to build and trickier to maintain. The Warriors have the opportunity to see this through, and so they\u2019ll try. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at this as the final dance,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr. \u201cLike I said, we want to have some fun and enjoy what we have this year and move on from there. Our focus is to really enjoy it while it lasts. And nothing lasts forever, so we know that. We want to go out this year and enjoy every step of the way.\u201d Thompson repeated Thursday how much he \u201cloves\u201d living in the Bay Area and \u201cI\u2019d be crazy not to\u201d think about the amount of in-prime talent he\u2019d leave behind if he signs elsewhere. Green said he imagines himself a Warrior \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Durant? We\u2019ll see. In the meantime, the Warriors, like Durant, will take it year-by-year. It\u2019s the only way to do business in the modern NBA. This year promises big returns, once again, on the floor. The last team to reach the Finals five straight years was the Bill Russell Celtics. And the Warriors, who swept the Cavaliers last June, who bring Durant and Curry and Thompson and Green back, finally have a center-piece this time. When Cousins returns, this team will be built to make history. And then, come free agency next summer, when the bill comes due, we\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re built to last.

But the asking price set by Minnesota appears to be too high, even for the Heat, according to Zach Lowe and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . Stein reports the Heat have been \u201caggressively\u201d pursuing Butler since he requested a trade from the Minnesota Timberwolves last week. Despite their mutual interest, the Heat have reportedly \u201cfound it hard to get Minnesota to clearly communicate,\u201d according to Stein. Thibodeau reportedly tried to convince Butler to stay during a meeting on Monday, according to ESPN , but the 29-year-old star \u201cremained resolute\u201d on his desire for a trade. Meanwhile, team owner Glen Taylor reportedly wants to accommodate Butler\u2019s request in order to quickly end this situation. Thibodeau talked about the Butler situation with Reid Forgrave of CBS Sports on Tuesday. \u201cOur reality is that he has requested a trade, so we\u2019ll honor that,\u201d Thibodeau told CBS Sports. \u201cBut we\u2019re not just going to make any deal. He requested a trade and we\u2019re going to honor his request. But we\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s bad for the Timberwolves. We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s good for the Timberwolves. We have to prioritize that. That\u2019s what our job is.\u201d Despite Thibodeau\u2019s apparent willingness to trade Butler, ESPN reports teams are \u201cskeptical\u201d of Thibodeau\u2019s desire to make a deal and the situation remains \u201cvolatile\u201d in Minnesota. The Heat enter \u201918-19 with a nearly identical roster as last season, when they went 44-38 to secure the No. 6 seed. The addition of Butler could be enough to vault Miami into the top half of the Eastern Conference. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 59 games for the Timberwolves last season. > Morning Tip: What\u2019s Next Move For Minnesota?"},{"id":38520,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-toronto-raptors-defense-best-offenses","date":"2018-09-27","title":"One Team, One Stat: Toronto Raptors struggled to defend the league's best","content":" NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann gets you ready for the 2018-19 season with a key stat for each team in the league and shows you why it matters. Today, we look at the Toronto Raptors, who struggled to defend the league\u2019s best offenses. The Raptors\u2019 defense allowed 16 more points per 100 possessions in games against the league\u2019s top 10 offenses than it did in games against the league\u2019s bottom 20 offenses . That was the league\u2019s biggest such differential. Toronto had the league\u2019s second best defense against the bottom 20 offenses and the second worst defense against the top 10. Overall, the Raptors were the only team that ranked in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency last season, the first time in franchise history (23 years) that they ranked in the top five on defense. But that top-five ranking was a little deceiving, because the Raptors fattened up on the league\u2019s not-so great offenses. It\u2019s important to take care of business. The league\u2019s best record (35-2) against the 12 teams that finished below .500 helped the Raptors earn the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Washington Wizards fell to the 8 seed partly because they went 20-15 against those same 12 teams with losing records. In games played between the 18 teams that finished with winning records, Toronto (24-21) had just one more win than Washington (23-24). Of course, you don\u2019t see the bad teams in the playoffs. And in the Raptors\u2019 case, there was clearly more to see in how they played against better competition, especially defensively. Toronto actually played the fewest regular season games (20) against the league\u2019s top 10 offenses, because\u2026 The difference between the Raptors\u2019 defense in those 20 games vs. the other 62 was in their opponents\u2019 effective field goal percentage and their opponents\u2019 turnover rate, which happen to be, of the \u201cfour factors\u201d of defense , the most important ones. The Raptors basically forced the same shots against the top 10 offenses (64 percent of shots came from the restricted area or 3-point range) as they did against the bottom 20 (62 percent). And though the top 10 offenses shot better in the paint, Toronto still ranked seventh on those shots against that group. It was on shots from the outside where there was a more dramatic difference. The top 15 scorers against the Raptors (those that scored at least 25 points per game) were all perimeter players, most of them were the primary ball-handler for their team, and rookie OG Anunoby was the primary defender on most of those primary guys . But against the top-10 offenses, the Raptors\u2019 defense was at its best (109 points allowed per 100 possessions) with Anunoby on the floor, and it was the best bench in basketball that really struggled to hold its own defensively. The players with the biggest differential between how many points the Raptors allowed against the top-10 or not-top-10 offenses were C.J. Miles, Fred VanVleet and Delon Wright. In the conference semifinals, the defense was pretty dreadful no matter who was on the floor . After allowing the Washington Wizards (the No. 14-ranked offense in the regular season) to score 106.7 points per 100 possessions in the first round , the Raptors allowed the Cleveland Cavaliers (No. 5 offense in the regular season) to score 121.5 in the conference semis . That was the biggest DefRtg increase from round to round for any team in the 2018 postseason. Furthermore, the 121.5 was 18.5 more than Cleveland scored in the first round and the fourth best mark for any team in a playoff series over the last 20 years. And again, it was on the perimeter where the Raptors\u2019 defense really struggled. Cleveland shot 41 percent from 3-point range ( compared to 32 percent in their other three series ) and the 8.2 turnovers per 100 possessions that the Cavs committed were the fewest for any team in a playoff series over the last 20 years. Good news! Not only has LeBron James taken his talents to the Western Conference, but the Raptors also acquired Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green from the team that has ranked in the top five defensively for each of the last six seasons. It\u2019s possible that, with a year of NBA experience under his belt, Anunoby will be one of the league\u2019s best wing defenders this season. If so, if Leonard is healthy, and if Green doesn\u2019t see much drop-off at the age of 31, the Raptors will have three of league\u2019s best wing defenders. Not only will they be able to put together some terrific defensive lineups, but they\u2019ll also (and maybe more importantly) be able to keep at least one stopper on the floor at all times. Playing in an Eastern Conference that lost its best offensive player, the Raptors will certainly be a top-10 defensive team once again. But where progress can be made is in their ability to defend the best. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Phoenix Suns, who set a new standard for futility on both ends of the floor. The Suns ranked last in both offensive and defensive efficiency last season. In the 41 years since the league started counting turnovers in 1977, only three other teams have ranked last on both ends of the floor. The Charlotte Bobcats did it in 2011-12, a lockout-shortened, 66-game season. Prior to that, the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns did it when there were fewer than 30 teams in the league. So the Suns made history as the first team to rank on both ends of the floor in a 30-team league in an 82-game season. They fired head coach Earl Watson and sent point guard Eric Bledsoe home after they were outscored by more than 40 points in two of their first three games , and things didn\u2019t get much better from that point on. The Suns had a much better record than the other three teams that have ranked last on both ends of the floor. The 100.8 points they scored per 100 possessions were only 5.3 fewer than the league average, making it only the 61st worst offensive season (among the 1,118 team seasons) of the last 41 years. The 110.6 points they allowed per 100 possessions were only 4.4 more than the league average, making it only the 82nd worst defensive season over the last 41 years. Still, the Suns record was somewhat inflated. They were 21-61 with the point differential of a 16-66 team. And of course, last on both ends of the floor is what it is. Offensively, the Suns\u2019 issues started with their inability to shoot. They ranked last in effective field goal percentage (49.5 percent), one of three teams that ranked in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (53.1 percent, 24th), mid-range field goal percentage (38.6 percent, 23rd ), and 3-point percentage (33.4 percent, 30th ). According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Suns ranked 20th in the percentage of their 3-point attempts that were uncontested and 21st in the percentage of their 3-point attempts that were off the catch. They ranked 16th in the percentage of their 3-point attempts that came from the corners. None of those rankings were great, but none of them were in the bottom five, either. They didn\u2019t take the worst threes. They just shot them the worst. The 34.6 percent the Suns shot on catch-and-shoot threes ranked 30th . The 33.1 percent they shot on wide-open threes ranked 30th . And the 32.9 percent they shot on above-the-break threes ranked 30th . The three Suns who attempted the most threes \u2013 Troy Daniels, Devin Booker and Dragan Bender \u2013 all shot better than the league average (36.2 percent) from beyond the arc . But other Suns combined to shoot a brutal 28.1 percent from 3-point range on almost as many attempts (1,122) as Daniels, Booker and Bender totaled. On defense, the Suns were the only team that ranked in the bottom 10 in each of the four factors . (Only two other teams \u2013 Memphis and New York \u2013 ranked in the bottom 10 in three of the four.) They were particularly bad at forcing turnovers ( they ranked 28th ), preventing layups ( only two teams allowed more attempts in the restricted area ), and defending the arc ( they ranked 26th in opponent 3-point percentage ). The great news is that the Suns are starting from scratch with a new head coach, Igor Kokoskov, who will put in a new system, both on offense and on defense. Kokoskov comes from Utah, where the Jazz have played much more deliberately the Suns over the last few years. And it will be interesting to see if the new coach breaks the Suns\u2019 streak of 20 straight seasons in the top 10 in pace . Last season, the Jazz did move up from 30th to 25th in pace, but remained in the top five in time of possession . Replacing Marquese Chriss (29 percent from 3-point range last season) with Ryan Anderson and having Trevor Ariza take some minutes from Josh Jackson (26 percent) and T.J. Warren (22 percent) will help the shooting. And better ball movement will help a team that has assisted on just 52 percent of its buckets, the lowest rate in the league, over the last five years. On the other end of the floor, Kokoskov won\u2019t have Rudy Gobert. Tyson Chandler is a former Defensive Player of the Year and Ariza has been one of the league\u2019s best perimeter defenders, but both of those guys will be competing for minutes with Lottery picks who need time to develop. It could be a slow climb, but the Suns have nowhere to go but up. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * Today\u2019s Team: Boston Celtics 2017-18 Record:  55-27, lost in East finals to Cleveland Cavaliers Who\u2019s new: Robert Williams (Draft) Who\u2019s gone:  Greg Monroe The lowdown: The pride of the Celtics lasted all season and well into the playoffs for a team that lost Gordon Hayward in the opener and then Kyrie Irving late in the season. Despite missing their top two players, Boston came within a few games of the best record in the East and one game from reaching the NBA Finals \u2014 given the circumstances, a remarkable run. Part of the reason was Jayson Tatum, the rookie whose maturity and development was pressed on fast-forward by necessity. Tatum was asked to win games and accept a large share of the scoring and he accepted that challenge and aced the test. Yet the Celtics were hardly a one-man act, mainly because they couldn\u2019t afford to be; Al Horford was an All-Star, Jaylen Brown took a leap in his second year and Terry Rozier played admirably in the playoffs as the point guard replacement for Irving. Given how well they fared without Hayward and Irving, the Celtics entered the offseason with few pressing needs and the favorite in the East with LeBron James now in the West. The offseason was all about Hayward and Irving getting healthy. Nothing more, nothing less. Sure, there was a flirtation with the Spurs about obtaining Kawhi Leonard, mainly because the Celtics have assets: Young players on cheap rookie contracts and picks. Those talks led nowhere \u2014 unfortunately for Boston, Kawhi landed in Toronto , one of the challengers for the East title this season. But missing out on Kawhi wasn\u2019t particularly damaging for the Celtics. They didn\u2019t desperately need him, and anyway, why sacrifice someone such as Tatum, who\u2019s signed for another few years on a team-friendly deal, or even Brown? Why part with young and enduring assets when there\u2019s no guarantee Kawhi would\u2019ve re-signed in 2019? In the end, it was a no-lose situation for the Celtics. Tatum and Brown have upside, and they fit well on this team. Besides, after missing two crucial players last season, GM Danny Ainge wants to give this crew a chance to be whole, for once. And not only for this season; the Celtics are built to sustain, especially if they re-sign Irving in 2019, but that\u2019s a story for another day. Hayward had a minor setback during his recovery and required a second procedure in the spring, a follow-up surgery on his left ankle. Yet his prognosis is good and by summer\u2019s end he looked agile during workouts. Irving\u2019s recovery from a knee infection had no speed bumps and he, too, is projected to be fit for camp. When he wasn\u2019t promoting his Uncle Drew movie, Irving was fast at work on the practice court. It\u2019s not that the Celtics had a completely quiet offseason otherwise. There was the matter of giving restricted free agent Marcus Smart a contract extension in a soft market, and as expected nothing was settled right away. Eventually, Smart signed for a reported $52 million over four years and the Celtics retained a tough-nosed defender and chemistry guy whose shooting is still a work in progress. The signing of Smart will make next summer an interesting one for Boston. Irving\u2019s deal will be up, and the Celtics must talk terms with Rozier, too. Finally, Brown will be eligible for an extension. That\u2019s the one \u201cdownside\u201d to all of the talent collected by Ainge; you can\u2019t pay everyone, unless of course you\u2019re willing to write a fat luxury tax check annually. Without a lottery pick \u2014 the Brooklyn gifts finally ran dry \u2014 the Celtics used their late first-rounder on Williams, a burly power forward with a gentle touch. He didn\u2019t endear himself to the Celtics by showing irresponsibility almost from the start . One reason he fell deep in the first round was because of questions regarding his work ethic. Certainly, the rookie from small town Louisiana will need to grow up fast. He\u2019ll have Horford around to teach him the finer points of being a professional. And they don\u2019t come more solid than Horford. Williams is 6-foot-10 with a 7-6 wingspan and brings good defensive instincts. If he gets his body and his act together, he might see time in the back of the rotation, especially with the Celtics declining to keep Monroe. Otherwise, there was no need for the Celtics to embark on a heavy offseason or take risks with their rotation. If anything, Boston needs to see how the pieces fit next to Hayward and Irving. Because of that, don\u2019t be too surprised if the Celtics endure some initial growing pains, even with Brad Stevens\u2019 coaching. But with a healthy core and LeBron on the other coast, the East is Boston\u2019s to lose as the Celtics enter camp.

(AP) \u2014 Miami guard Tyler Johnson has already seen what his new-and-much-improved paychecks from the Heat will look like this season. Frankly, he\u2019s still stunned. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d Johnson said. Virtually every player in the NBA is a millionaire. But a handful like Johnson, Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and Orlando\u2019s Aaron Gordon are seeing their salaries rise to a different stratosphere this season, enormous raises that may come with an enormous rise in expectations. When getting paid like stars, it stands to reason that fans \u2014 and their teams \u2014 will expect star efforts. \u201cI feel like some people would feel the added pressure, but I don\u2019t,\u201d said Gordon, who signed a $76 million extension with Orlando over the summer. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go out there and play the game that I love to play with teammates that I love to play with. I know they\u2019ll be there to help take the pressure off me and I\u2019m going to help take the pressure off them.\u201d According to figures reviewed by The Associated Press , there are 11 NBA players who in line for raises of $11 million or more this season. Many of them are former high draft picks cashing in on non-rookie deals for the first time, and a couple others are established stars whose deals went from \u201cbig\u201d to \u201creally big\u201d this summer.  No one saw more of a salary leap than Jokic, who made $1.5 million last season and will collect $25.5 million this season. Jokic is an enormous talent and making his first All-Star team is among his goals this season, but the Nuggets aren\u2019t burdening him with significantly higher expectations because of the big pay raise. The way they see it, he\u2019s already earned the payday. \u201cThe contract is the contract,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cBut the great thing is about Nikola Jokic \u2014 yes, he\u2019s making a lot more money, but it\u2019s not going to change who he is. He\u2019s a humble kid from Sombor, Serbia, who just wants to play basketball and wants to make his teammates better.\u201d Jokic is the biggest part of some big increased-salary commitments by the Nuggets. Gary Harris got a $14 million raise, going to $16.5 million this season. And Jokic said he\u2019s not going to change. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the same way I was three years ago,\u201d said Jokic, who hails from a nation where the average worker takes home the equivalent of about $8,000 a year. \u201cIt worked really good for me so I\u2019m going to keep it that way.\u201d Many of the biggest-raise getters are former high draft picks cashing in on non-rookie deals for the first time, like Joel Embiid with Philadelphia, Andrew Wiggins with Minnesota and Zach LaVine with Chicago. Embiid\u2019s salary rose $19.4 million to $25.5 million. Wiggins got a $17.9 million raise to $25.5 million, LaVine is getting a $16.3 million jump to $19.5 million, and Gordon will make $21.6 million \u2014 an increase of $16.1 million from last year. They were all lottery picks, now paid like lottery winners. Chris Paul and Paul George \u2014 long-established stars \u2014 also got $11 million raises, both now making over $30 million. Chicago\u2019s Jabari Parker ($20 million, a raise of $13.2 million) and Houston\u2019s Clint Capela ($13.8 million, a raise of $11.5 million) also are in the big-raise club. Heat guard Dwyane Wade knows what that first big payday is like. He has free advice to players like Johnson and Gordon. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to understand is that just because you\u2019re getting $15 million more now, you don\u2019t need to live $15 million richer,\u201d said Wade, who has collected about $200 million in NBA salaries. Undrafted out of Fresno State, Johnson was the beneficiary of a bidding war of sorts between Miami and Brooklyn two summers ago. The Nets signed Johnson to a $50 million offer sheet that the Heat matched, even though it called for Johnson to make a total of about $11 million in the first two years of the deal and about $39 million in the last two. The big money kicks in now, from $5.9 million last year to $19.3 million this season. But Johnson\u2019s role might not change as much as his paycheck, and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has urged him to not think he needs to do anything differently because of the salary. \u201cThe world that pro athletes live in now, it\u2019s much different than it used to be,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cGuys should embrace it, learn how to compartmentalize, learn how to manage all of that noise in a healthy manner where it\u2019s not affecting the thing that matters most.\u201d Johnson has had two years to prepare for this payday. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about basketball is that basketball doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBasketball stays the same. It\u2019s you who changes around it. Am I going to change for the better or am I going to change for the worse? I\u2019ve come to terms with that I\u2019m going to make a big check this year. What other people say, that\u2019s just outside noise.\u201d He and Gordon agree \u2014 the money shouldn\u2019t change much. \u201cI love this game,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cWith or without money.\u201d"},{"id":38569,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-boston-celtics-3-point-defense","date":"2018-09-26","title":"One Team, One Stat: Boston Celtics have history of defending 3-point shots","content":" NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann gets you ready for the 2018-19 season with a key stat for each team in the league and shows you why it matters. Today, we look at the Boston Celtics, who have a remarkable history of defending the 3-point line. The Celtics have ranked in the top five in opponent 3-point percentage in each of the last 11 seasons. That\u2019s an incredible streak for a few reasons\u2026 Over those 11 seasons, no other team has ranked in the top five in opponent 3-point percentage more than *five times. There are seven franchises that haven\u2019t once ranked in the top five since \u201907-08. Another 12 teams have ranked in the top five just once over those 11 years. * The team that has ranked in the top five five times over the last 11 teams is the Chicago Bulls, with four of those five top-five finishes coming under Tom Thibodeau, who was the architect of the Celtics\u2019 defense at the start of their streak. So that\u2019s 19 of the league\u2019s 30 teams that have ranked in the top five in opponent 3-point percentage no more than once in the last 11 seasons. The Celtics have done it in all 11. And last season, the Celtics led the league in opponent 3-point percentage for the third time in that stretch (and for the first time in Brad Stevens\u2019 five seasons). According to Second Spectrum tracking, the percentage of their opponents\u2019 3-point attempts that were contested was right around the league average. So was the percentage of their opponents\u2019 3-point attempts that were off the catch (vs. off the dribble). But the Celtics allowed opponents to take only 19 percent of their 3-point attempts, the lowest rate in the league, from the corners. As a whole, the league shot 35.6 percent on above-the-break threes and 39.3 percent on corner threes last season. Celtics opponents actually shot almost 42 percent from the corners. But reducing the number of attempts that come from the corners is to better defend the 3-point line as a whole. And the 32.5 percent their opponents shot on above-the-break threes was the league\u2019s lowest mark . The Celtics\u2019 ability to switch screens allowed them to stay in front of ball-handlers and stay at home on shooters, but their opponents\u2019 3-point percentage was actually lowest ( 31.6 percent ) with Aron Baynes \u2013 one guy they didn\u2019t switch with as much \u2013 on the floor. Not coincidentally, the Celtics allowed just 97.0 points per 100 possessions with Baynes on the floor, and that was the lowest on-court DefRtg among players who averaged at least 15 minutes in 40 or more games . With the league continuing to take more threes every year, the correlation between opponent 3-point percentage and defensive efficiency on a team-by-team level only gets stronger. And with their size, scheme and smarts, the Celtics should again be a top-five team in regard to both. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Los Angeles Lakers, who showed in-season improvement from beyond the arc. The Lakers saw both the biggest post-All-Star-break increase in 3-point percentage and its biggest post-break increase in the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range . In regard to both numbers, the Lakers ranked in the bottom 10 before the break and in the top 10 after the break. As a result, they scored 7.8 more points per game from beyond the arc. That helped them score 4.6 more points per 100 possessions after the break (107.4 \u2013 15th in the league ) than they did before it (102.8 \u2013 26th ). That marked the fifth biggest post-break improvement in offensive efficiency. More important is that the increased and improved 3-point shooting made the Lakers a better complement to LeBron James, their new star and primary ball-handler. James led the league with 344 assists on 3-pointers (4.2 per game) last season, assisting on threes from 15 different teammates. Though the Lakers had quite a bit of roster turnover \u2013 they rank 27th in the percentage of last year\u2019s minutes (57 percent) played by players still on the roster \u2013 players still on the roster accounted for 68 percent (201\/ 296 ) of their 3-pointers after the break last season. The only Lakers who made at least 10 threes after the break and are no longer on the roster are Brook Lopez (40) and Isaiah Thomas (29). Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the Lakers\u2019 top-seven player who saw the biggest increase in 3-point percentage, shooting 42.3 percent from beyond the arc after the break, up from 36.1 percent before it . Kyle Kuzma also went from below average (35.8 percent before the break) to above-average ( 38.5 percent after ). Both Caldwell-Pope and Kuzma also saw an increase in the percentage of their shots that were threes. Lonzo Ball was the Laker rotation player who saw the biggest increase in the percentage of his shots that came from 3-point range, taking 61 percent of them from beyond the arc after the break, up from 49 percent before it . Ball\u2019s 3-point percentage remained pretty poor ( 30 percent before the break, 31 percent after it ), but there\u2019s value \u2013 both in regard to effective field goal percentage and floor spacing \u2013 in being willing to shoot from deep. If Ball can at least improve from the corners ( from where he was just 9-for-37 last season ), he can be a better complement to James. Even with the post-break improvement last season, the Lakers still ranked 29th in 3-point percentage overall and, because of that, were one of two teams \u2013 New York was the other \u2013 that had a field goal percentage above the league average ( they ranked 14th ) and an effective field goal percentage below the league average ( they ranked 16th ). The perimeter veterans that the Lakers added to the roster \u2013 Michael Beasley, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson \u2013 shot a combined 32 percent from 3-point range last season. (Beasley has actually shot 40 percent over the last two seasons, but has taken 2.8 times as many mid-range shots as threes over those two years.) So yes, L.A.\u2019s approach to roster contstruction around James has thus far differed from that of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the last four seasons. The only Laker in the top 100 in 3-point percentage (among players with at least 300 attempts) over the last three seasons is Kuzma, who ranks 100th at 36.6 percent. Every other team in the league has at least one player who ranks higher and two teams \u2013 the Cavs and Clippers \u2013 each have six players who have shot better than Kuzma on at least 300 3-point attempts over the last three years. But James will turn some teammates into better shooters, and he will increase the percentage of threes that the Lakers take from the corners. Last season, the Lakers shot 39.4 percent on corner threes and 33.7 percent on above-the-break threes, but they ranked 27th in the percentage of their threes that came from the corners. James\u2019 teams have ranked in the top six in 11 of the last 13 seasons. And over the last two seasons, he has assisted on 292 corner threes, 120 more than any other player. It\u2019s going to be fascinating how this Lakers\u2019 roster fits with its new star. A portion of it took a small step forward in that regard last season. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days . * * * 2017-18 Record:  52-30, lost in second round to Boston Celtics Who\u2019s new:  Wilson Chandler (trade), Zhaire Smith (Draft), Landry Shamet (Draft), Mike Muscala (trade) Who\u2019s gone:  GM Bryan Colangelo, Marco Belinelli, Ersan Ilyasova, Justin Anderson The lowdown: The Process took an accelerated growth in springtime when the Sixers won their final 16 games to reach the playoffs and announce their arrival. This was mainly because their two young stars were healthy for the most part. Joel Embiid turned beastly on both ends and displayed the skills that perhaps elevated him among the top three big men in basketball. Ben Simmons brought great size and court vision to the point guard spot and earned Kia Rookie of the Year honors. Others helped too, such as JJ Redick and Dario Saric and the supporting cast compensated for the mysterious shoulder injury and faulty shooting mechanics of guard Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 overall pick who played just 14 games and was a non-factor. The Sixers faltered two rounds into the playoffs , which did nothing to detract from the strides made and confidence gained by the franchise. If anyone thought the Sixers\u2019 season would be a hard act to follow, well, their offseason was just as intriguing, if not more. Their general manager was forced out because of his wife\u2019s burner account on Twitter; a dramatic draft-night trade ruined a family\u2019s homecoming celebration; the Sixers went 0-for-2 after coach Brett Brown stated a desire to go \u201cstar hunting\u201d; and their first-round pick underwent surgery for a broken foot. Otherwise, all was quiet. Oh, actually, there\u2019s one more: Fultz, their beleaguered former No. 1 overall pick from two summers ago, was held out of Summer League play, raising red flags about his ability to overcome a serious case of shooting yips. Lots of drama followed a groundbreaking 52-win season, not all of it good. It began with Colangelo losing his job because of social media, which was certainly a first for the NBA. When internet sleuths raised questions about criticism of Embiid and former Sixer Jahlil Okafor among other issues from a suspicious account, the dot-connecting led to the Colangelo household. It was an embarrassing episode for the franchise and a costly one for Colangelo, right in the middle of offseason evaluations and improvement plans. Elton Brand was hired to replace Colangelo just a week ago; Brand worked in Sixers personnel and also briefly played for the club several years ago. But after Colangelo left, Philly went two months with Brown assuming the GM duties on a temporary basis and he led a draft strategy that turned weird. The Sixers drafted Mikal Bridges, a hometown kid whose mother worked in the Sixers\u2019 human resources department, and hugs and tears followed. The Bridges family was still celebrating when, moments later, Mikal was re-routed to the Suns for Smith. It wasn\u2019t the smoothest transition, but Brown was correct when he said the franchise comes first. The Sixers also got an unprotected No. 1 pick in 2021 for their trouble and the Bridges\u2019 pain. Besides, Brown said based on the Sixers\u2019 scouting, the difference between Bridges and Smith was marginal. If so, then that\u2019s a win for Philly. Can you imagine that, come the summer of 2021, the Sixers are fresh off a championship \u2014 OK, that\u2019s only a projection, but not unrealistic \u2014 and ready to choose in the lottery? The mood regarding Smith didn\u2019t last long: He broke his foot at a developmental camp in Las Vegas and underwent surgery to repair a Jones fracture, the same injury that caused Simmons to miss a season. Which means, for the fourth straight time, a Sixers high draft pick will take injury concerns into his rookie season, following Embiid, Simmons and Fultz. After the draft, the Sixers set their sights on free agency and trades. Armed with money to spend and boasting Embiid and Simmons as building blocks, the Sixers were in great position to add a significant piece: LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard. They whiffed on both. LeBron chose Hollywood over cheesesteaks, which wasn\u2019t unexpected; playing for the Lakers and in Los Angeles gave him greater post-career options. The Sixers and Brown thought they had a real chance at Kawhi, however. Brown was an assistant coach in San Antonio and knows the quiet star very well. Kawhi has family connections in New Jersey, not far from where the Sixers train. Finally, the Sixers had assets to offer the Spurs: Fultz, Saric, future picks. Yet they wouldn\u2019t part with Simmons, and that was a deal-breaker; Kawhi was traded to Toronto and the Sixers ended their summer without adding a star. They did get Chandler from the Nuggets, someone who has spent his entire career under the radar, yet is a consistent and reliable swingman. Chandler will replace Ilyasova, who joins the Bucks. Philly also decided to bring back Redick at age 34 on another one-year deal. Redick was a core piece last year, averaging 17 points, supplying shooting range (42 percent from deep) and leadership. The summer was supposed to help provide a fresh start for Fultz, who spent much of it redesigning (or trying to recapture) his shooting mechanics. However, Fultz didn\u2019t play in Summer League, which is common for second-year players. That likely meant Fultz wasn\u2019t ready and the Sixers were protecting him from potential embarrassment. As insurance, the Sixers took Shamet with their second first-round pick. Much like Fultz, Shamet brings size (6-5), can play combo guard and unlike Fultz (at least for now) has distance on his jumper. As they prepare for camp, the Sixers won\u2019t have LeBron or Kawhi and they\u2019re not sure what they have in Fultz. Philly\u2019s search for a third star must wait until next summer.

(AP) \u2014 Although the Lakers\u2019 first official practice of the LeBron James era was focused on defense and learning new terminology, they ended it with a good old-fashioned 3-point shooting contest. The Lakers\u2019 new superstar was just another teammate during the spirited back-and-forth competition Tuesday. When James wasn\u2019t draining his own 3s, he marveled along with everybody else at the surprising perimeter prowess shown by JaVale McGee, the 7-foot veteran with exactly one 3-pointer during a game in his 10-year NBA career. The Lakers have many weeks of work ahead to become a cohesive team assembled around James, but he can already sense they\u2019re heading down the right path. They\u2019re planning to have plenty of fun along the way, too. \u201cI\u2019m not a very patient guy, but I understand that I have to be patient right now,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be patient with myself, too, because this is a new start for me. It\u2019s my first year in a new system. I know how to play the game of basketball, but this is all new to me, too. So I have to be patient with myself, not only with my teammates.\u201d James was both upbeat and businesslike after his first workout under coach Luke Walton, who entered the NBA in the same draft class as James in 2003. The Lakers will hold double practices and a scrimmage on the first two days of camp leading toward their preseason debut in San Diego on Sunday night. James intends to enjoy the process in his new city. \u201cWe\u2019re here for one reason and one reason only, and that\u2019s to someday hoist the trophy,\u201d James said. \u201cObviously that\u2019s the end of the road, but you have to have those types of championship habits every day, not only on the floor, but off the floor as well. \u2026 Everyone is excited to get back to work. That\u2019s a good thing. No one is coming in today and wishing it was still summer. It\u2019s the best time of the year. Basketball season is back up, baseball season is on its way to the playoffs, and the NFL is in Week 4. So what could you ask for as a sports fan?\u201d James naturally becomes the center of attention on any team, and he quickly assumed a leadership role for the Lakers. He\u2019s also eager to see his veteran teammates assert themselves to help the Lakers\u2019 young returning core, whether it\u2019s Rajon Rondo instructing his fellow guards on assignments, or Lance Stephenson vocally calling out defensive instructions in half-court work. \u201cHe\u2019s LeBron. He\u2019s one name,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cIt speaks for itself. He\u2019s been a leader and a mentor in this league for a long time, on and off the court. He has a blueprint off the court as well. So he embraces his role. He embraces all the pressure that he\u2019s ever dealt with in his career, and he\u2019s always risen above the occasion.\u201d Although Walton and James are just getting to know each other, the coach is grateful that his new star is leading by example from the opening practice. The Lakers have lacked this level of respected on-court leadership in the two seasons since Kobe Bryant\u2019s retirement, but LeBron and his fellow new veterans have strong ideas about how an NBA team must approach its work to be a winner. \u201cI could see it yesterday,\u201d Walton said. \u201cThe way he\u2019s approaching (practice) has changed from the pickup we were playing in the summer. It definitely set the tone. We\u2019re on a journey that started today, and we\u2019re very serious about the business that we got done today.\u201d"},{"id":38567,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/work-undone-minnesota-jimmy-butler-seeks-exit-door","date":"2018-09-25","title":"With work unfinished in Minnesota, Jimmy Butler seeks exit door","content":" MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 In an afternoon filled with questions and answers by members of the Minnesota Timberwolves, one significant query went unasked and, obviously, unanswered: What does Jimmy Butler, self-styled team leader, think about Jimmy Butler, star so suddenly headed out the door? Butler, who dropped a trade request last week on Wolves coach\/president of player operations Tom Thibodeau, wasn\u2019t on hand Monday to field that one. The team had pre-empted as much clamor and controversy as it could by excusing the All-Star wing from the usual gauntlet of Media Day activities. Thibodeau and general manager Scott Layden, with owner Glen Taylor\u2019s blessing and\/or urging, also agreed that Butler would not be participating in Minnesota\u2019s practices Tuesday and Wednesday \u2013 or, presumably, at any point in the future. > Morning Tip: What\u2019s Next Move For Minnesota? They continued to talk with teams, sifting through what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real in search of the best offer they can get for a season\u2019s worth of Butler before he hits free agency. The rent-a-player market isn\u2019t the most vibrant when the player has his eye on only a handful of eventual destinations 10 months from now. \u201cIf it make sense for the team, then we\u2019ll do it,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cConflict in the NBA, it\u2019s not unusual. Every team has it. So you navigate through it. You put the team first, you put winning first.\u201d The winning \u2013 which figures to get a lot more difficult without Butler \u2013 will have to wait while Minnesota\u2019s navigation system recalibrates. \u201cAt first it was weird. I was in shock,\u201d forward Taj Gibson said, of learning that his teammate both in Chicago and Minnesota wanted out. \u201cIt really is [distracting]. You look at the strides we took last year just to get to the playoffs. And to get hit with a right hook right before training camp, it\u2019s weird.\u201d \u201cI still have a lot of love for him. I look at the good times. I can\u2019t look at the negatives. \u2026 I understand the NBA is a business. You have to just do what\u2019s right for yourself. But at times it\u2019s tough.\u201d No kidding. Minnesota was poised for an onward-and-upward season, built off a 2017-18 performance that brought 47 victories and the end of the franchise\u2019s playoff drought after 13 mostly miserable years. Butler led the way, averaging 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists, throwing down the squad\u2019s grittiest defense and happily shouldering most late-game heroics. In and around his on-court work, Butler seized the Wolves\u2019 locker room, not unlike his grab at the Bulls\u2019 reigns in his last two seasons in Chicago. That didn\u2019t go over so well back then, with Butler managing to offend veterans such as Joakim Noah and Pau Gasol one year, then rankle young players when he and stopover teammate Dwyane Wade piled on some criticism the next. Thibodeau, though, brought Butler to the Twin Cities with a mandate to show and tell young stars Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins how to work, how to win. There was chafing, sure. Wiggins and Towns felt picked on at times, while Butler grew frustrated when lessons needed repeating. Still, the results made the heavy price Thibodeau paid \u2013 trading young players Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen for Butler and rookie Justin Patton \u2013 worth it. Another year together, mentor and mentees, figured in an even tougher Western Conference to get Minnesota closer to the top-four seed it played like before Butler got hurt a couple times after January. And then? Money. Money on top of money. The Wolves hoped to sign Butler to a contract extension this summer, but weren\u2019t willing tear up their bench or trade Wiggins in a way that would enable Butler to score his fattest payday now. Instead, they offered him a four-year, $110 million extension, the most possible given their current constraints. Predictably \u2013 because in free agency next summer he could get a five-year offer from the Wolves worth $188 million or a four-year, $139 million deal from another team \u2013 Butler declined. And then he decided not to wait until next summer, either because he didn\u2019t trust Minnesota to pony up that max contract (he\u2019ll turn 30 next September with some knee injuries in his past and Thibs-driven heavy miles on his clock) or because dragging Towns and Wiggins grew too annoying. Or maybe both. So Butler greeted Thibodeau last week when the coach flew out to L.A. to meet with him with the decision that he wanted out. Or as Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas said Monday on NBA TV, the leader wanted to leave. \u201cThis is definitely not a good look on Jimmy Butler,\u201d Thomas said on the training camp tip-off show. \u201cYou were brought here to be the leader. You were brought here to take this team to the playoffs and get some experience, and that is exactly what they did. You\u2019re supposed to go back, have a good summer, and everybody is supposed to come back rejuvenated, and then the future looked really bright with this team. \u201cBut the leader in terms of Jimmy Butler has said \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to call it what it is \u2013 \u2018I want the money. I\u2019m looking for the money, I looking for myself, I\u2019m not necessarily looking out for what\u2019s best here for the team.\u2019 Because this is a good, young group that you\u2019re leaving.\u201d This is not what Taylor signed up for when he agreed to the Butler trade. This is not what Thibodeau vouched for in assuring his boss about the plan and the player. This is not what Towns, Wiggins and the rest of the Wolves needed dropped on them on the brink of a season or, frankly, at all. This is not what a leader does, that\u2019s for sure, not now, with the job at most half done. Next summer, if Butler had waited, he could have exercised his freedom of movement after another step forward for this franchise, by which time the Wolves\u2019 two young stars would be more ready to shed their training wheels. Butler could have indulged his desire for brighter lights and a bigger city \u2013 the Clippers, the Knicks, whomever \u2013 at a natural and honorable transition point in his career (uh, the end of a contract). Instead he joins the likes of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard among recent franchise faces who edged toward the \u201cExit\u201d door with work undone. It\u2019s not a good look, leader turned diva. If you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d think Butler had adopted a Costanza-like approach: do everything the exact opposite of what a real leader should do. Chew on teammates until everyone\u2019s raw, neglect the carrot in favor of the stick and then, abruptly, bail. Thibodeau will be left holding the bag after whatever return he, Taylor and Layden can extract sans leverage from a suitor. This episode will be another referendum on the one-boss, two-hats model abandoned lately by Detroit (Stan Van Gundy), Atlanta (Mike Budenholzer) and the Clippers (Doc Rivers). Not that Thibodeau, of all people, was going to let go of his proverbial rope on Butler or Minnesota\u2019s mission. \u201cYou look more at the actions,\u201d the coach\/POBO said. \u201cThere\u2019s many people in this league who say all the right things but never do any of the right things. Sometimes a player may say something and it may not be in the right tone, but it is the right message. So when I look at, what is the impact? It was huge.\u201d Thibodeau said trading for Butler was worth both the cost and the risk, because of what they got back (\u201ca top-10 player\u201d) and what the Wolves considered the likelihood of retaining him beyond this season. Losing Butler now wasn\u2019t calculated into that risk, of course. For the stars left behind, the limbo of the team\u2019s predicament and the fact that no one had broken a sweat yet, never mind lost a game, enabled them to react with little more than a shrug. \u201cThis is the NBA,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just have one leader,\u201d said Towns, whose new five-year, $190 million extension certainly looked synchronized to Butler\u2019s decision to leave, though the talented young big man said it was not. Towns added: \u201cI only worry about what I can control.\u201d Again, Gibson was the one who pulled back the curtain, slowed the spin and said what the rest of the NBA surely is thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure [on this team],\u201d the veteran said. \u201cI can\u2019t sugar-coat it.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That\u2019s a question many fans ask as the flurry of trades , free agent news and player movement seems to never stop during the summer. Since the Golden State Warriors claimed their third title in four years back on June 8, NBA teams have undergone a massive number of changes as they prepare for the season ahead. With the opening of training camps just around the corner, NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell will evaluate the state of each franchise as it sits today \u2014 from the team with the worst regular-season record in 2017-18 to the team with the best regular-season record \u2014 as we look at 30 teams in 30 days .                                 * * * Today\u2019s Team: Cleveland Cavaliers 2017-18 Record:  50-32, lost in NBA Finals to Golden State Warriors Who\u2019s new:  Collin Sexton (Draft), Sam Dekker (free agency); Channing Frye (free agency) Who\u2019s gone:  LeBron James, Jeff Green, Jose Calderon The lowdown: Despite losing Kyrie Irving to a forced trade the previous summer, the dominance of the East continued for LeBron and the Cavaliers, who yielded home court advantage and survived a few scares to reach The Finals and a fourth meeting with the Warriors . LeBron showed an amazing if not unprecedented combination of durability and punch at age 33; he never missed a game and finished runner-up to James Harden for Kia MVP (though he remained the game\u2019s best player via unscientific common-sense poll). LeBron ripped through the postseason and bailed out Cleveland with last-second heroics in the first round against the Pacers and then again against the Raptors. Kevin Love served as a reliable shotgun rider despite missing 23 games. There were weird moments: Coach Ty Lue took a leave of absence during the season and Isaiah Thomas, Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose had brief and unfulfilled stints before moving on. In the end, LeBron was enough for Cleveland to reach The Finals, yet not enough to overcome the Warriors; Cleveland was simply overmatched in the series sweep. There was no jersey-burning in the Flats and owner Dan Gilbert didn\u2019t react impulsively once again with a stern letter to the fans. And it didn\u2019t exactly catch the franchise by surprise. Still, LeBron leaving Cleveland for the second time in his career was a deflating civic moment that obviously will have serious repercussions for the franchise moving forward. The brisk business by scalpers, national TV appearances, celebrity sightings and automatic trips to the championship round are certain to vaporize overnight. That\u2019s what happens when a legend leaves and takes the circus with him. This was a more digestible departure than the last one, though. Having fulfilled his pledge to bring a championship to Cleveland, few if any held a grudge against arguably the greatest player in NBA history for seeking new adventures. It didn\u2019t feel like a snub; rather a lifestyle change here in his sunset years and Cleveland made peace with being turned downed in favor of the glamour offered by Los Angeles. Problem is, LeBron didn\u2019t leave behind much. In order to placate the star and his management group, the Cavs gave rich extensions to JR Smith and Tristan Thompson, a pair of clients and declining role players, and therefore are stuck with them for the near future at least. Those players, especially Smith, hoarded a spot that could\u2019ve been used on a youngster in their player development program. You could argue that it doesn\u2019t matter; the Cavs made four straight Finals and won a title with those players, and that would be true. It\u2019s just that the bill for those deep trips into June is finally due, and the Cavs are capped out at least through this season. They also made a curious move by extending Love for four years and $120 million. That\u2019s incredibly rich even for a five-time All-Star, only because Love may not revert back to the level and numbers he posted in Minnesota at this stage of his career. It showed that Cleveland wants Love to stick around and keep the club competitive here in the post-LeBron rebuilding era. It also was wise at least from this standpoint: Cleveland isn\u2019t a destination place for free agents, so why not hold onto a good player as long as possible? The downside: Trading him at that salary will be like moving mountains if the Cavs sour on Love in the future. Signing that deal was a no-brainer for Love, given the market these days. Where else would he get $30 million a season while in his 30s? With LeBron gone, the touches will increase and so will the responsibility for Love, who prospered in that role with the Timberwolves, but that was four years ago. And the Wolves went nowhere. Another issue for Cleveland is the lack of a nurtured up-and-comer. All of those trips to The Finals meant low draft picks. Ordinarily, Andrew Wiggins would be poised to take over but he was sacrificed to get Love. That\u2019s why it was wise of Cleveland to demand and get a prized Brooklyn No. 1 pick in the Irving deal two summers ago. It was the Cavs\u2019 trump card in case LeBron did the expected. When they finally flipped that card, Sexton was on the other side. Depending on whose scouting reports you believe, Sexton was the most attractive point guard in the draft and a player whose mature game screams \u201cNBA ready.\u201d Basically, the Cavs surrendered an unhappy Irving for a 19-year-old potential Irving, who starred at Alabama and outplayed Trae Young, taken five spots earlier, in their only meeting last season. What\u2019s especially pleasing for the Cavs is that Sexton genuinely wants to be in Cleveland, even without LeBron. The kid is thrilled and eager to embrace the challenge of being part of the solution. In that sense, he\u2019s exactly what the Cavs need, just when the waters are getting choppy. The Cavs also signed Dekker, who can bring athleticism to the forward spot, especially since the Cavs lost Green to free agency. The offseason was seismic for Cleveland but inevitable as well. The rebuilding of the club begins now, and this time, with no hard feelings.

Today, we look at the Golden State Warriors, who flipped the switch defensively in the postseason. The Warriors\u2019 defense allowed 3.7 fewer points per 100 possessions in the playoffs ( 100.5 ) than it did in the regular season ( 104.2 ). At their best, the Warriors are the league\u2019s best team on both ends of the floor. And that\u2019s what they were when things got serious. They were the first team in 17 years to lead the postseason in both offensive and defensive efficiency. The last playoff team to rank first in both points scored and points allowed per 100 possessions was the 2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers , who went 15-1 on their way to their second of three straight championships. The Warriors were the No. 1 defensive team in each round of the postseason\u2026 A big difference between the Warriors\u2019 regular-season defense and their postseason defense was in how well their opponents shot from 3-point range: 35.7 percent ( 10th lowest opponent mark in the league ) in the regular season, 31.3 percent ( lowest opponent mark ) in the playoffs. Three of the four worst 3-point shooting games in the 2018 playoffs were by three different teams (San Antonio, New Orleans and Houston) against the Warriors. There\u2019s some randomness in those numbers, but it was in opponent 3-point percentage where the Warriors fell off defensively from the 2016-17 regular season ( 32.4 percent, first in the league ) to the \u201917-18 regular season ( 35.7 percent, 10th ) and where they ranked in the top five for four straight seasons before ranking 10th last season. It may be that additional focus and energy shows up most in their ability to contest shots on the perimeter. There were two other big differences between the regular-season Warriors and the postseason Warriors, and they had to do with their lineups. In the playoffs\u2026 In the regular season, the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup \u2013 Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Green \u2013 allowed 116 points per 100 possessions in 127 minutes . In the playoffs (against three top-10 offenses), the same lineup allowed just 99 points per 100 possessions in 129 minutes . McGee and Pachulia, who combined to start 74 games at center last season, are gone. DeMarcus Cousins has been added (to much fanfare), but the Warriors will need a starting center until Cousins is healthy. No matter who is on the floor, we can imagine that the regular-season defense will be imperfect and inconsistent. But we know that the champs have the ability to flip the switch when they need to. Note: The above table is based on true possession counts. Other efficiency stats here are based on possession estimates (typically higher than true possession counts).

Today, we look at the Philadelphia 76ers, who had the league\u2019s best starting lineup. The Sixers\u2019 regular starting lineup \u2014 Ben Simmons, J.J. Redick, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Joel Embiid \u2014 outscored its opponents by 21.4 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among 29 lineups that played at least 300 minutes together . Among 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes together , only a Minnesota Timberwolves lineup, with reserve Tyus Jones in place of starter Jeff Teague, was better (plus-23.5 points per 100 possessions). In total, the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup outscored its opponents by 268 points, 100 more than any other lineup in the league . That was a product of both how much it played \u2013 the 600 minutes it logged ranked sixth among all lineups last season \u2013 and how good it was on both ends of the floor. Among the 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes last season, the Sixers\u2019 starters ranked fifth both offensively (117.1 points scored per 100 possessions) and defensively (95.7 points allowed per 100). It held opponents to an effective field goal percentage of just 45.9 percent, the lowest opponent mark among the same group of 48 lineups . Because of how good the starting lineup was, the Sixers were the league\u2019s best team in the first six minutes of the first quarter, outscoring their opponents by more than 21 points per 100 possessions. That was the best mark for any team in either the first or last six minutes of any quarter last season. With consistently strong starts, the Sixers held the lead for 63 percent of their regular-season minutes. Only the Houston Rockets (66 percent) held a lead for a greater percentage of their minutes. But sustaining leads was more difficult for the Sixers. They tied for the league lead in most losses after leading by 15 points or more (seven) and the most losses after leading by 20 points or more (four). Philly saw the league\u2019s biggest drop in NetRtg from the first half (plus-9.4 points per 100 possessions) to the second half (plus-1.3) of games . The starting lineup wasn\u2019t as good in the second half of games as it was in the first half, but that\u2019s because it outscored their opponents by an incredible 30 points per 100 possessions in 251 minutes before halftime . It\u2019s mark of plus-15.8 per 100 possessions in the second half still ranked sixth among lineups that played at least 100 second-half minutes . The bench was another story. The Sixers\u2019 bench wasn\u2019t terrible, but they had the league\u2019s biggest discrepancy between aggregate starters NetRtg (plus-8.9 points per 100 possessions \u2014 third in the league ) and aggregate bench NetRtg (minus-0.6 \u2013 15th ). In 2,442 minutes with three or more of their regular starters on the floor, the Sixers outscored their opponents by 10.8 points per 100 possessions. In 1,511 minutes with fewer than three of their regular starters on the floor, they were outscored by 3.0 points per 100 possessions. Brett Brown staggered the minutes of his starters, so that he rarely had fewer than two on the floor during non-garbage time, and he\u2019ll surely continue to do the same this season. But the Sixers will need more from players 6-10 on the roster if they\u2019re going to take another step forward. They did get a lift from Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova after adding the pair in February last season. But both of them have moved on, replaced by Wilson Chandler and Mike Muscala. And of course, the biggest variable on the Sixers\u2019 bench is Markelle Fultz, who played just 14 games last season. If Fultz rebounds from a rough year and starts to show why he was selected with the No. 1 pick in the 2017 Draft, the Sixers will be that much deeper and more equipped to hold onto big leads.

And on his official first day as a Laker, that\u2019s all LeBron James was trying to pull off, in an unfamiliar uniform awash in gold with purple trimming. A weird sight, you say? \u201cLooks fine to me,\u201d said Rajon Rondo. \u201cNice,\u201d added Lonzo Ball. \u201cFits him,\u201d said Kyle Kuzma. So the Laker flock has spoken, and now that this sartorial issue is behind him, the next task is to get that jersey off his back and raised to the rafters someday. Should that happen, it would surely mean LeBron, and by extension the Lakers, did something special over the course of time to earn that honor. That\u2019s the challenge at the start of the LeBron Laker era: Meet or surpass expectations that may or may not be too steep. Throughout his career, when LeBron arrived, he raised the level of consciousness within his team and the hopes of the city that team represented. It began in 2003, when the Cleveland Cavaliers drafted him, then continued to the Miami Heat with the \u201cnot one, not two, not three\u201d championship proclamation, then the return to Cleveland to fulfill some unfinished business. Now he\u2019s with a franchise that hasn\u2019t won a championship since 2010 or made the playoffs since 2013, a dry spell that other teams would kill for. But this is the Lakers. This is tradition that craves to continue. The Cavaliers hadn\u2019t won a title when he arrived, and the Heat only had one. The Lakers own 16 titles, and he only needs to stare upstairs at the row of championship trophies sitting in the window of owner Jeanie Buss\u2019 office, which overlooks the practice floor at the training facility, to be reminded how this is a different animal. \u201cThe excitement around the game for me in general, no matter what uniform I\u2019m in \u2014 I\u2019m just always humbled that I\u2019m able to play the game at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we all know, and it can speak for itself, that this has been a historic franchise in this league for years. We don\u2019t even have to talk about the years they won championships, talk about the players that have come through this franchise, worn this uniform. That\u2019s excitement in its own right. And then it\u2019s just always humbling for me any time I get an opportunity to be a part of something special \u2026 I\u2019m happy to be in this point today.\u201d As for what\u2019s coming in the months ahead, LeBron could\u2019ve drank the training camp Kool-Aid that\u2019s served at many NBA practice facilities around this time of year. Instead, he was blunt and realistic when he said: \u201cWe have a long way to go to get to Golden State.\u201d He knows the Lakers couldn\u2019t convince Paul George to leave Oklahoma City or get DeMarcus Cousins on discount, as the Warriors did. Nor did LA get in on the Kawhi Leonard sweepstakes \u2014 team president Magic Johnson unwilling to surrender a package of young Lakers to swing a trade. And speaking of youth, LeBron also knows Kuzma, Ball and Brandon Ingram, all big parts of the rotation, are 23 and under and without playoff experience, thus lacking in big-boy basketball. In that sense, the essence of the LeBron James Experience might not receive a booster until next summer, when the Lakers will be armed with ample cap room for two max players and their youngsters will be a year older and perhaps wiser as well. But that\u2019s an issue for next year around this time. Meanwhile, the Lakers prepare to embark on a training camp that JaVale McGee is convinced will be spirited, all because of LeBron. \u201cHe\u2019ll raise the intensity, and actually, he already has,\u201d said McGee, citing the handful of pre-camp scrimmages. \u201cWhen he walks into the gym, it\u2019s just a different feeling. You know you\u2019ve got to meet his energy and bring your best. This will not only help us develop as a team, but will help us win games. He\u2019s all business. That was pretty apparent right away.\u201d And so, it\u2019s a delicate juggling act by LeBron: School the young players on the art of winning, deliver the level of excellence that a storied franchise demands and that he\u2019s capable of bringing, yet maintaining a level of perspective about his first season with the Lakers. Of the projected nine-man rotation, five are newcomers, and only LeBron remains in his prime. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the only (mark) of success is winning a championship. There\u2019s only one champion, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not successful. There\u2019s gonna be wins and losses and things of that nature. But what you can control is how you prepare every day. How we prepare every day to get better every day. \u201c We \u2019re a new ball club coming together. Obviously they have some returning guys, but as far as the ball club we\u2019re all new to each other. We have to take our bumps and our bruises. There are going to be good times and bad times. That\u2019s what happens with a team that\u2019s new. But if we continue to work the process and continue to sacrifice for one another and put in the commitment and the time to be great, everything will fall into place as I\u2019ve said before.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

After eight consecutive NBA Finals appearances, he knows his new team isn\u2019t a true contender with Golden State and the NBA\u2019s elite just yet. The superstar welcomed every step in the process Monday as he began his next chapter in purple and gold. James finally made his first formal appearance as a member of the Lakers at their media day, nearly three months after he left Cleveland for a four-year, $153.3 million free-agent deal. In between posing for photos in his new gold No. 23 uniform, the 33-year-old superstar revealed part of the motivation behind his decision to join an iconic franchise that hasn\u2019t made the playoffs in five years. \u201cNo matter what uniform I\u2019m in, I\u2019m always humsbled that I\u2019m able to play this game at this level,\u201d James said. \u201cI think we all know that this franchise has been a historical franchise in this league for years. \u2026 That\u2019s an excitement in its own right.

I play ball. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d James joined the Lakers along with veterans Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley this summer. They\u2019ll team up with the Lakers\u2019 talented young core to change the face of a 16-time champion franchise emerging from the worst half-decade in its lengthy history. But James made it perfectly clear he won\u2019t judge his achievements in Los Angeles solely on championships, particularly not during these Lakers\u2019 first season together. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the only thing that\u2019s a success in marking a season is winning a championship,\u201d James said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one champion, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not successful.

There\u2019s going to be bad times. That\u2019s what happens when a team is new. But if we continue to work the process and we continue to sacrifice for one another and put in the commitment and the time to being great, everything else will fall into place.\u201d This perspective contrasts sharply with the ring-or-bust mentality held by Kobe Bryant, the last superstar to wear this uniform. Two seasons after Bryant\u2019s retirement, the Lakers have been replenished by the arrival of James and the veterans that he assembled around him. \u201cI think this is a great start for the Lakers to get back to championship caliber,\u201d said McGee, who just won two championship rings in Golden State. \u201cFor me personally, I feel like this is everybody\u2019s dream as a basketball player, to put on the purple and gold and compete for a championship.\u201d But on their first formal day together, nobody suggested the Lakers are remotely ready to compete with the Warriors, who would have four consecutive championships if James hadn\u2019t won the Cavs\u2019 first championship in legendary fashion instead in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go to get to Golden State,\u201d James said. \u201cThey can pick up right where they left off, starting with training camp. \u2026 We\u2019re picking up from scratch, so we\u2019ve got a long way to go. We can\u2019t worry about what Golden State is doing.\u201d"},{"id":38540,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-demarcus-cousins-noncontact-work","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Golden State Warriors' DeMarcus Cousins set to do noncontact work when training camp begins","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 DeMarcus Cousins has progressed in his recovery from surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon and is doing light shooting and other skill work on the court and will be able to do some noncontact work as the Warriors\u2019 training camp begins. Golden State general manager Bob Myers said anyone who thinks the two-time defending champions plan to \u201csave DeMarcus for the playoffs, I think that\u2019s inaccurate, when he can play he\u2019ll play.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean Cousins will be pushed to return too soon. He was re-examined last week by Dr. Richard Ferkel, the surgeon who performed his procedure, and all was positive. Myers said Cousins would be evaluated again in four weeks. \u201cWe won\u2019t rush him but we also won\u2019t hold him back,\u201d Myers said at Monday\u2019s media day. Cousins injured his Achilles in late January and it prematurely ended his season with the Pelicans. Before the injury, Cousins averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 48 games. He said he\u2019s encouraged to be running full-court, playing 1-on-1 and 2-on-2. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard. I would be lying if I told you anything different. It\u2019s been an absolute grind,\u201d Cousins said of his recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of dedication, a lot of commitment. \u2026 It\u2019s probably one of the hardest things physically and mentally I\u2019ve been through in my career so far.\u201d When Boogie is back, Golden State will have five 2018 All-Stars in coach Steve Kerr\u2019s starting lineup. \u201cThen you get to see DeMarcus Cousins, once he\u2019s healthy. How does he fit into the team? And how does the team grow as a whole?\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI think it will be fun as a coach and for fans. And by the end of the season we\u2019ll be clicking and ready to roll in the playoffs.\u201d Jordan Bell would like to see the fiery Cousins, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green get into it. Bell figures a little healthy scrapping on the practice floor might be good fuel for Golden State as it goes for a third straight title after winning three of the past four championships. \u201cI hope they fight this year, I would love \u2026 I just want to see the fades go up, that\u2019s all I want to see is KD and him catching a friendly one, him and Draymond catching one,\u201d Bell said. \u201cEverybody just catch a friendly one, I want to record it. Just to make sure everybody\u2019s good, no hostility. I don\u2019t know when, I just hope it happens. I\u2019m very excited about that. I\u2019m going to be right there in front commentating, egging, gas `em, do all that.\u201d Green would much prefer that Bell take on Boogie. \u201cHe\u2019s a young guy. He should be the one wanting to fight,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m getting old, so he can have that.\u201d According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Warriors would be the first team since Boston in 1975-76 to play five All-Stars from the previous season at the same time. That group was Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek. The 28-year-old Cousins\u2019 imposing presence will mean so much. \u201cObviously DeMarcus is one of the most talented players in our league. Most people see, `Oh, man, DeMarcus went to the Warriors, they won,\u2019 and it ain\u2019t that easy,\u201d Green said. \u201cLike that\u2019s 26 points a game you\u2019re working into the lineup. It\u2019s tough. But that\u2019s the fun part. The fun part is making it work. I think back to when KD came here, everybody, `Oh, man, they\u2019ve got Kevin Durant, they won 73 games, it\u2019s over.\u2019 And honestly the fun part wasn\u2019t winning the championship. The fun part was during the year figuring that out, how we was going to make that work.

(AP) \u2014 Kristaps Porzingis is a one-of-a-kind player, a 7-foot-3 package strong enough to pound in the paint but with plenty of speed and shooting to play on the perimeter. That\u2019s ideal for the basketball court. Not so much for rehabbing a serious knee injury. Porzingis said Monday his size has necessitated a slow recovery from a torn left ACL and prevents him or the New York Knicks from establishing a timetable for his return to action. \u201cWe\u2019ve done things differently because there is no protocol for a 7-3 guy,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cThere is no timetable for my type of body, my size and all that. So we\u2019ve done things differently. We\u2019ve been really conservative and at the same time I\u2019ve been killing myself working, so we\u2019re just going to have to keep moving forward and keep progressing and then see when is the right time for me to be back.\u201d Porzingis was injured after a dunk in a Feb. 6 loss to Milwaukee, just before he was set to play in his first All-Star Game. He is doing light running and shooting but is not cleared to do anything serious enough to make an early season return likely. \u201cIt\u2019s already been 7+ months so obviously I\u2019m getting itchy and want to be back on the court as soon as possible, but it won\u2019t happen until I am 110 percent and I\u2019m medically cleared,\u201d Porzingis said. There is no reason to rush. The Knicks are a young team unlikely to challenge for a playoff spot, so they can prioritize their franchise player\u2019s health even if it means sitting Porzingis for most or all of the season. He didn\u2019t rule that out, though he wants to play, and it would certainly help the Knicks attract free agents next summer if Porzingis can get back on the floor and show his array of skills that led Kevin Durant \u2013 potentially one of those free agents \u2013 to nickname him a unicorn. Porzingis spent most of his summer in Europe so he could be near his home in Latvia, where he was visited by new Knicks coach David Fizdale. Porzingis, who played professionally in Spain before the Knicks drafted him with the No. 4 pick in 2015, did his rehabilitation with Real Madrid, saying those were the best facilities available. He said he\u2019s pleased with where he\u2019s at in his recovery \u2013 even though doctors who have worked on similar injuries can\u2019t say where exactly that is. \u201cYeah, but they haven\u2019t done it on a 7-3 guy,\u201d said Porzingis, whose weight is listed at 240 pounds. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s something new for everybody and as I said we\u2019re trying to just be conservative and doing the right thing without pushing it too much.\u201d He said all his energy is on his recovery, so he hasn\u2019t thought much about the contract extension he is eligible to sign before the season. It\u2019s unclear if the Knicks even intend to offer one, with both sides possibly feeling it\u2019s better to wait until next summer. In the meantime, he intends to be around his Knicks teammates as much as possible, though he doesn\u2019t know if he will travel with them. But whenever he is around will be a benefit. \u201cWe know he\u2019s not going to play beginning of the season, but at the same time we know that he\u2019s still going to be out there, giving us his insight, giving us his ideas of what he sees out there on the floor that can help the team throughout the way,\u201d swingman Tim Hardaway Jr. said. \u201cSo until he gets back we\u2019re going to hold down the fort.\u201d"},{"id":38565,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-jimmy-butler-minnesota-timberwolves-future","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Now that Jimmy Butler reportedly wants out, what are the Minnesota Timberwolves' options?","content":" The line of excoriation started to the right. No luau pig was roasted as thoroughly as the Bulls were on Draft night 2017, after they traded Jimmy Butler and the 16th pick overall to the Timberwolves for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and the 7th pick overall in the first round. The conventional wisdom was that Minnesota was not only getting the best player in the deal, but the Bulls weren\u2019t getting anyone of significance in return. Meanwhile, the Wolves were putting together a contender in the rugged West, with Butler joining Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins to form a potential triple-headed hydra that could be as good as anyone\u2019s outside of Oakland. And, despite a knee injury that limited Butler to 59 games, precipitating a near collapse down the stretch, the Wolves made the postseason on the final day of the regular season , beating the Nuggets in an overtime, winner-take all meeting at Target Center. The win broke the longest postseason drought \u2014 13 years \u2014 in the NBA. The Wolves weren\u2019t perfect \u2014 they were quickly dispatched by Houston in the first round \u2014 but at least they were finally going in the right direction. Less than five months later, the dreams of sustained playoff appearances and building a true contender again in the Land of 10,000 Lakes have dried up. Climate change was not the culprit \u2014 unless you count the dark cloud that Butler has cast over the franchise. His decision to demand a trade \u2014 a demand that is apparently going to be honored by Wolves owner Glen Taylor \u2014 has again brought uncertainty to a franchise desperate for stability, one that tried gamely to change the subject by announcing Towns\u2019 long-expected max contract extension on Sunday, all but skywriting over Paisley Park: Karl-Anthony is our future. Don\u2019t worry. All is well. And Towns may be that good. At the least, he\u2019s the best Minnesota can put out there every night. But the Wolves were expecting so much more out of Butler\u2019s time in Minnesota than a hurried restart 14 months later. Butler was supposed to represent a permanent turning of the corner, a final and lasting shift from the losing culture that Tom Thibodeau had been given free reign to smash when he was named coach and team president in 2016. Thibs\u2019 insistence on bringing back \u201cTimberBulls\u201d from his Chicago days \u2014 Taj Gibson, Butler, Derrick Rose \u2014 were viewed more benignly as instilling tough-minded vets who knew what it took to grind out wins and make the playoffs as long as Butler was Thibs\u2019 voice on the floor and in the locker room.  And Butler had no problem getting his point across. \u201cOn paper. I don\u2019t think we play hard enough right now,\u201d Butler told me in February . \u201cI don\u2019t think we guard the way we\u2019re supposed to in order to win. There are a lot of things that we have to be better at, night in and night out, no matter if the opponent is home, away, neutral. No matter what the start time is. You\u2019ve got to play hard. We do not do that.\u201d Even then \u2014 the Wolves would beat the Lakers the next night to enter the All-Star break at 36-25, with Butler joining Towns in Los Angeles as Western Conference All-Star representatives \u2014 there was the scent of discontent in the air. As mentioned above, Butler was already grinding on his young teammates to give more effort defensively, the way he seemed to grind on people in Chicago \u2014 including, ironically, Rose, who would soon be his teammate again. But by that time, Rose\u2019s injuries had muted his voice throughout the Chicago organization. (You can\u2019t make demands when you\u2019re no longer The Man, so to speak.) Friction between Butler, Wiggins and Towns, long rumored, was made clear in a report last week by The Athletic Minnesota\u2019s Jon Krawczynski.  Yet Butler would have likely stayed had Minnesota acquiesced to his push for a max deal \u2014 but not just any max. What Butler wanted Minnesota to do going into the summer was a \u201crenegotiation\/extension\u201d of his current deal. He was eligible this summer \u2014 the fourth anniversary of his signing his current deal in 2014 \u2014 for an R\/E. (The Rockets gave James Harden an R\/E last year, for an additional $170 million through 2023 on top of the $68 million remaining on his existing deal.) It would have required Minnesota to trade out significant salary without taking anything back in return. (The only realistic trade options at the time, as the Wolves had just committed $146 million to Wiggins, were Gorgui Dieng \u2014 whom Minnesota has made available in the past, and who the Wolves are reportedly attaching Butler now \u2014 or Gibson.) As a player with between 7\/9 years\u2019 experience, Butler was eligible for a maximum of approximately $32 million in 2018-19,105 percent of this year\u2019s 7-9 year max deal ($30.560M). Butler makes $20.4 million this coming year, so the Wolves would have had to create $11.1 million in additional cap room to give to Butler, then work off his \u201cnew\u201d number of $32 million to extend him out four more years after that, through 2023. That would have given Butler, in essence, a new five-year deal worth $185.9M. But the Wolves, obviously, declined to make those moves. They did offer Butler a max deal based on his actual number \u2014 about $110 million \u2014 in early June. Butler turned them down. Right now, there\u2019s no reason for any of the places Butler reportedly wants to go to give up picks or young players as part of a package for him. (Sources indicated over the weekend that the Knicks, supposedly one of those teams, haven\u2019t made any inquiries about the 29 year old.) The Nets and Clippers, the two other teams reportedly on his short list, will have room for at least one \u2014 and, most likely, two \u2014 max free agents in the Summer of 2019. Each can just wait for Butler to opt out of his final year and become an unrestricted free agent, at which they can offer him a four-year max deal. But trading for Butler now does bring potential benefits to each, too. Having Butler on the roster and willing to make a long-term commitment would make many teams \u2014 and, certainly, rebuilding ones \u2014 more attractive to other potential free agents. No one likes to be the first pair of boots on the ground; if they know Butler\u2019s going to be there, as potential free agents know James is staying in L.A. for the long haul, they\u2019ll likely be more inclined to give them a real look. And, there is more than a passing question among many teams exactly how sound Butler\u2019s knee will be going forward. Meniscus surgery often \u2014 not always \u2014 starts players down the road toward bone on bone conditions in the knee, which has started many players down the road toward retirement. League sources maintain the Wolves will hold out for at least one first-round pick as part of a package for Butler, and will also want some young vets who can grow with Towns, Wiggins and Jeff Teague, whom Thibodeau pushed hard for last summer to take over for Ricky Rubio at the point, going forward. And Miami, rumored on Sunday to be making a push for Butler, can trade its 2019 first-round pick after officially moving its 2018 first to Phoenix as part of the Goran Dragic trade. (The Heat would not violate the Stepien Rule prohibiting the trade of successive first-round picks in Drafts by trading its 2019 first.) Pat Riley is always in acquisition mode, and would certainly be willing to gamble if he could convince Butler to be the next great franchise player on South Beach within a year.  Making a move this close to camp, no matter who the talent, comes with some risk. But Jimmy Butler isn\u2019t some flier on which a team would be unnecessarily taking a risk; he\u2019s a four-time All-Star, one of the best defensive players in the league at his position, and a willing shot taker in crunch time. Oklahoma City, one would think, showed in its pursuit and retention of Paul George how any franchise, no matter how long the odds, can keep a star happy if its truly committed to winning and has the infrastructure in place to do so. So, who should also get in line and make this happen? Glad you asked. \u2022 New Orleans . The Pelicans would likely have to pepper any offer with a future first-rounder to get Minnesota to bite. But New Orleans also has an expiring contract and floor-stretching big in Nikola Mirotic, who played for Thibodeau in Chicago in 2014-15 (of course, Thibs didn\u2019t play him a ton in that one season they were together, but Niko\u2019s a little older now), along with guard E\u2019Twaun Moore, who also played for Thibs that year in Chicago along with one more under Fred Hoiberg before signing in New Orleans in 2016. Moore could, at least, help make up some of the lost production from Jamal Crawford. And the Pelicans are always on the clock when it comes to amassing enough talent to keep Anthony Davis \u2014 who officially hired Rich Paul as his new agent over the weekend \u2014 from getting antsy. A Jrue Holiday-Butler backcourt would be as earnest a show of good faith as the Pels could make. \u2022 Phoenix . The Suns certainly have lots of pieces to put a representative package together, and if they\u2019re indeed serious about Devin Booker being the de facto point guard a la Harden once Booker is back from hand surgery, and serious about short-tracking their rebuild, pursuing Butler would make sense. T.J. Warren would certainly be the likely centerpiece of any Suns deal going back to Minnesota; the Wolves would have to see a future for Warren at the four as well, one would surmise, because it\u2019s not likely Wiggins is going to move from the three. \u2022 Milwaukee . The Bucks have a prolific shooter in Khris Middleton who would make sense as part of a deal going back to Minnesota as a two-way wing, and a coach in Mike Budenholzer who could certainly find ways to get Butler open as he did Kyle Korver in Atlanta. But the Bucks\u2019 2019 first-rounder is set to go to the Suns (though it is protected 1-3 and 17-30 for the Bucks). Butler and Eric Bledsoe as a backcourt could be the best defensive duo in the league, and better defense will let the Greek Freak run wild more in transition. \u2022 Washington . The Wizards, having fallen well off the pace now in the East behind Boston, Philly and Toronto, need to get back in the game with a bold move. Otto Porter is a very good, very solid two-way forward who has become an outstanding shooter (.404 career on threes) who will never cause any of his coaches a minute\u2019s worry; he won\u2019t demand more shots \u2014 though he should \u2014 from Scott Brooks. But Butler\u2019s better, and a Wall-Beal-Butler threesome would give the Wizards a fighting chance to compete with the top teams in a now wide-open East. Not sure Porter alone would make Minnesota bite, though, so the Wiz would likely have to take Dieng as well and add other pieces. \u2022 L.A. Clippers . If Butler truly does want to go there, Tobias Harris would surely be central to any package returning to Minnesota \u2014 and with Harris unrestricted after this season and almost certain to test the market, the Wolves would certainly be within their rights to ask for one of L.A.\u2019s young crop of talented players from the 2018 Draft \u2014 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, or Jerome Robinson \u2014 in return as well. If the Clips really are big game hunting for another big-time free agent next summer, adding one of them would simply be future investment in that plan; having Butler in tow will make getting the next star that much easier."},{"id":46709,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/toronto-raptors-kawhi-leonard-focused-year","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Kawhi Leonard focused on this season with Toronto Raptors","content":" TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Kawhi Leonard spoke publicly in his first appearance as a Toronto Raptor and said he is physically ready to play. Leonard joined the Raptors in a summertime blockbuster trade with the San Antonio Spurs. How long he stays in Toronto is unclear but the former NBA Finals MVP and two-time defensive player of the year who was limited to nine games last season because of a right quadriceps injury insists he is ready to go as the team gets ready for training camp in Vancouver, British Columbia. Sharing a podium with Raptors president Masai Ujiri, who pulled the trigger on the trade that included acquiring forward Danny Green and losing DeMar DeRozan, Leonard addressed the biggest question about him: His health. \u201cRight now I\u2019m feeling great, ready to play basketball.\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThroughout the summer I worked on my body. Took it step-by-step, just getting fully healthy, getting ready to make this extra step this season.\u201d The usually reserved Leonard also attempted to offer the crowded a room a little insight about himself. \u201cI\u2019m a fun guy,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cObviously, I love the game of basketball. I mean, there\u2019s just more questions you have to ask in order for me to tell you about myself. I just can\u2019t give you the whole spiel. I don\u2019t even know where you\u2019re sitting.\u201d Even after he located the reporters, Leonard was characteristically brief but managed to make his feelings clear, starting with his reaction to the July 18 trade that ended a sometimes fractious seven-year relationship with the Spurs and sent him to Toronto. \u201cExcited,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI\u2019m coming to a great city that loves basketball, a great organization and I\u2019m happy Danny was coming with me as well.\u201d A free agent next summer, Leonard said he arrived in Toronto \u201cwith an open mind,\u201d but wasn\u2019t ready to talk about what that means long-term. \u201cMy focus is on this year, this group that we have, and us striving to get to a championship,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all want to win, and if you\u2019re looking into the future, you\u2019re going to trip over the present.\u201d To land Leonard, Toronto gave up DeRozan, a team icon and four-time All-Star. San Antonio also got center Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 protected first-round draft pick. DeRozan\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t the only big offseason change in Toronto. The Raptors also fired Dwane Casey, who was later named NBA Coach of the Year, and replaced him with former assistant Nick Nurse. The rookie head coach said Leonard\u2019s diverse skill set will help bolster a \u201cversatile\u201d Raptors roster.  \u201cHe can guard smalls and bigs and he can score in and out,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool.\u201d The architect of the offensive overhaul that saw Toronto dramatically increase its 3-point shooting last season, Nurse suggested there may be more to come this season thanks to the addition of Leonard and Green. \u201cWe could,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cOn paper, our team has gotten better from behind the line. We\u2019ll see how that all plays out.\u201d One player who might take more 3-pointers is holdover point guard and four-time All-Star Kyle Lowry, DeRozan\u2019s close friend. Lowry, who had also not spoken publicly since the trade, disputed the notion he was miffed at Ujiri\u2019s move. \u201cI\u2019m here to do my job,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cOne thing about me is I\u2019ve always been prepared to come in, work, and try to win a championship. My mindset never changes: Come to work for the Toronto Raptors, try to win a gold ball.\u201d With Leonard along for the ride this season, that goal might be within reach for the Raptors. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun, man,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cAn opportunity like this, you\u2019ve got to take advantage of it.\u201d * * * "},{"id":38573,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-tyler-ulis-official-release","date":"2018-09-24","title":"Golden State Warriors sign guard Tyler Ulis","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 The back-to-back NBA Champion Golden State Warriors have signed free agent guard Tyler Ulis to a contract, it was announced today.
