Guarded by Wall, Irving scored the Celtics\u2019 final 12 points, nailing back-to-back 3-pointers in a 21-second span during the final minute of overtime, and willed Boston to a 130-125 victory . Irving finished with 38 points and seven assists and earned \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants late. He\u2019s one of the reasons the resurgent Celtics are on a seven-game winning streak. Wall, playing on a sore left heel, was no slouch. He poured in 34 points with 13 assists, an All-Star performance by most standards. Wall scored seven points in overtime, but was outdueled by Irving\u2019s 12. The Celtics\u2019 victory was impressive because they won on the road even though they were without Al Horford, Gordon Hayward and Jaylen Brown. Marcus Morris stepped up for Boston, scoring 27 and grabbing nine rebounds. * Thursday on NBA TV: Celtics vs. Wizards re-airs (4 p.m. ET) Anthony Davis put up a season-high 44 points and grabbed 18 boards, both highs among the night\u2019s top performers , as he helped the Pelicans hold off the Thunder, 118-114 . It was a dominant performance by Davis, who dunked seven times, but what sealed the victory was AD\u2019s rim-protecting presence on the defensive end. With the Thunder trailing 116-114 and fewer than 10 seconds remaining, Russell Westbrook had a lane to attack the basket for the tying bucket. But as Davis moved to guard the rim, Westbrook kicked the ball out to Alex Abrines, whose 3-point attempt banged off the front iron. The Pelicans secured the rebound for the win. Davis\u2019 night overshadowed Paul George, who had an All-Star night with 25 points, 11 boards and five assists. The much-anticipated showdown between the league-leading Raptors and the defending champion Warriors failed to live up to expectations. Playing the second of a back-to-back without Kawhi Leonard (sore right hip), the still-energetic Raptors took an early lead and kept it, routing the champs 113-93 . It was the first win in Oracle Arena for the Raptors since Feb. 8, 2004. The only negative for Toronto was the loss of Jonas Valanciunas with a dislocated left thumb in the first quarter. Kyle Lowry, who appears to be coming out of his shooting slump, logged 23 points and 12 assists for the Raptors. Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 30 points. Stephen Curry had an uncharacteristic shooting night, going 3-for-12 from the floor and 2-for-8 from 3-point range. Jeremy Lamb\u2019s tough bucket with a defender in his grill lifted the Charlotte Hornets to a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons. It wasn\u2019t a buzzer-beater, but the 22-footer from the right wing came close, with 0.03 of a second left. Lamb finished with 13 points, overshadowing another stellar night from Kemba Walker, who posted a near triple-double with 31 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. Blake Griffin had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Pistons in a losing effort. After a relatively strong start to the season, skidding Detroit has lost six in a row. Scrappy guard and fan favorite Matthew Dellavedova enjoyed a warm reception in his first game back in Cleveland as a Cavalier. The Aussie proceeded to nail a 3-pointer, and he moved past 2,000 points in his six-season NBA career. Dellavedova contributed big off the bench in the Cavaliers\u2019 113-106 win over the Knicks, scoring 15 points in 22 minutes, including shooting 3-for-5 from beyond the arc. This earned him a playful \u201cM-V-P\u201d chant. Rookies Luka Doncic and Trae Young, who were traded for each other on Draft night, had almost identical stat lines Wednesday night. But Doncic and the Mavericks earned the victory over Young and the Hawks , 114-107. Young finished with 24 points and 10 assists in 35 minutes, while Doncic had 24 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. The Mavericks\u2019 win was the first over the Hawks since Oct. 30, 2013. Dallas extended its home winning streak to 11 games. As is always the case on an 11-game night, there were some athletic slams. Giannis Antetokounmpo crossed the lane and threw it down in the Bucks\u2019 loss. Malik Monk showed off his hops early for the Hornets. Ben Simmons completed a nice alley-oop in the Sixers\u2019 127-124 loss to the Nets. The Mavericks\u2019 DeAndre Jordan did his best Shaquille O\u2019Neal impersonation with a breakaway dunk vs. the Hawks. Jordan shook the backboard and stanchion and clinged to the rim for a couple of seconds. https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRenderNBA\/status\/1073046550685847552 Ownership has its privileges. And Michael Jordan, owner of the Charlotte Hornets, exercised one of those Wednesday night, chiding Malik Monk from his near-the-bench courtside seat and even jokingly slapping him lightly on the back of the head a couple of times. Monk had drawn a technical foul for running onto the court after Jeremy Lamb\u2019s game-winner with 0.03 of a second left, giving the Hornets too many players. Spencer Dinwiddie had a career night, and he did it off the bench. Dinwiddie poured in 39 points to lead the Nets past the 76ers 127-124. He was four-of-six from beyond the arc, and became the first Nets player to score 35 or more points off the bench in a regulation game since Derrick Coleman had 35 in January of 1992."},{"id":36912,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/toronto-raptors-rule-out-kawhi-leonard-vs-golden-state-warriors","date":"2018-12-13","title":"Kawhi misses second straight game with hip injury","content":" OAKLAND, Calif.

Earlier in the day, Leonard was deemed questionable while getting treatment on his hip.

Draymond Green is back. Are we about to see the Warriors pull away from the pack in the crowded Western Conference?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Not only that, but DeMarcus Cousins is on his way back too. I do think Golden State has both the ability and the motivation now to put some distance between itself and the challengers of the West. Old nemesis Houston isn\u2019t pushing hard from behind, but OKC and Denver are hungry, high-quality teams that the Warriors dare not take lightly. Plus coach Steve Kerr always is looking for a new edge with which to play the regular season. And there\u2019s this: Golden State should want to leave the fans who have made Oracle Arena such a fantastic home court with something special. Playoff schedules are unpredictable, but the Warriors know what home games they have remaining in the regular season and ought to show off their best selves the rest of the way. Shaun Powell :   Yes, yes, yes. Not just because the Warriors are stocked better than anyone else, but there isn\u2019t a strong No. 2 in the West, not like last season. My hunch is the Christmas Day game with the Los Angeles Lakers will determine first place in the West, and that\u2019s the springboard the Warriors will use to leap beyond everyone else. That overblown KD-Draymond dustup (happens on plenty of teams) is history. Draymond\u2019s back, Steph\u2019s back and DeMarcus Cousins is coming. John Schuhmann :  All the ingredients are there. Denver is banged up, with Gary Harris and Paul Millsap both out for a few weeks. The next few weeks of Oklahoma City\u2019s schedule are tougher than the last few weeks were, and the LA Clippers have been showing signs of slippage. When the Warriors are healthy, they can be the league\u2019s best team on both ends of the floor and put together a lot of wins. But the champs are about to begin a tough stretch of the schedule themselves. Eight of their next nine games are against teams with winning records, and the only exception is a game in Utah (where the Warriors lost two games by a total of 70 points last season ). They can obviously beat any team in the league, six of those other eight games are at home, and they just finished a five-game trip with an impressive win in Milwaukee. But these next 18 days will tell us a lot about where they\u2019re at in regard to their focus on both ends of the floor. For the sake of assistant coach Ron Adams\u2019 sanity, it would be nice to see them climb from 17th to the top 10 in defensive efficiency by the end of the month. Sekou Smith :  We are absolutely going to see the Warriors stretch out in the coming weeks. They\u2019ve been waiting all season to get healthy enough to play to their true form. Add in the fact DeMarcus Cousins is clearly ramping up for his debut and the rest of the West should brace themselves for the flurry. They\u2019ll use all of these early-season hiccups as reminders of how quickly things can go awry when they\u2019re not on their grind. It might be the one thing they really needed to focus themselves prior to the start of the postseason. Talent-wise we know they don\u2019t have a peer in the Western Conference or the league. As long as they don\u2019t get in their own way, it\u2019s their world until someone stops them."},{"id":36921,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-next-step-chicago-bulls-future","date":"2018-12-12","title":"Blogtable: How can Bulls get franchise back on track?","content":" * * * The Chicago Bulls appear to be sliding off the rails. What\u2019s one thing \u2014 the first thing \u2014 this franchise needs to do to get back on track?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Stick to the Xs and Os for a while, and do it according to generally accepted activity principles. That means new coach Jim Boylen conveying the necessary messages in 90-minute practices and 45-minute shootarounds and backing off from the way he overloaded the work schedule in his first week. It also means the players focusing \u2014 hard \u2014 on basketball and behaving just a teeny, tiny bit like what they\u2019re doing is a job, with accountability and bosses\u2019 demands. It was a miserable look to complain about a practice the day after participating, at home, in the franchise\u2019s most lopsided loss ever, regardless of the five previous days\u2019 duties. Presumably both sides have grown from the embarrassing episode, and the healthiest Bulls squad so far this season can get busy doubling its victory total in, say, half the 28 games it took just to get six. Shaun Powell :   They need to take a serious look at the front office and see if it\u2019s working. Gar Foreman and John Paxson have had some decent drafts but little else and it\u2019s apparent they have a coaching problem here in December. For a team that hasn\u2019t put forth a reliable foundation, that from office has remained in place for a long time. Might be time to go in another direction. John Schuhmann :  More often than not, success and failure in this league start at the top. Bulls\u2019 ownership and the front office team of Gar Forman and John Paxson need to look in the mirror and figure out why the organization isn\u2019t functioning the right way. Even when the team was having success (the Tom Thibodeau years), there was a disconnect between management and the coaching staff. I\u2019m not sure how they go from where they are now to having everyone pulling in the same direction, but it is possible to hire a coach that\u2019s neither too tough nor too soft on the players. The development of their two young big men \u2014 Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr. \u2014 within a constructive environment should be priority No. 1. Sekou Smith :  The first thing the Bulls have to do is decide who is going to serve as the leader of the franchise. And not in name or in theory, but in the flesh. Whoever that is (owner or front-office man), he better step up and fill that void immediately. And if that\u2019s not the coach, fine. But if the players in that locker room are left to wonder who is the true leader of that operation, it\u2019s an issue that will continue to drag the entire group down. That\u2019s why I\u2019m never in favor of in-season coaching changes without a clear-cut vision of who the replacement is and that replacement being given every resource to do the job right. Change for the sake of change without a real plan is the worst possible situation to be in, particularly for a team stocked with young talent but no real direction."},{"id":36934,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/all-star-events-tickets-sale-official-release","date":"2018-12-12","title":"Tickets on sale now for 2019 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game presented by Ruffles , MTN DEW ICE Rising Stars and NBA All-Star practice & media day","content":"CHARLOTTE \u2014 The NBA today announced ticket availability  for its 2019 lineup of fan-favorite NBA All-Star events taking place Friday, Feb. 15 through Sunday, Feb. 17 in Charlotte.

Those two would give us a real show when they picked their teams playground-style. The choices would be intriguing but the commentary would be even better, with a couple of guys in charge who are quite willing to let it fly verbally about anyone or anything.

With that, LeBron James in the West and Joel Embiid in the East would be good for laughs. Oh well, we\u2019ll probably get Kawhi instead. John Schuhmann :  Because the All-Star draft is going to be televised this year, and for the sake of entertainment value, we should all be rooting for Joel Embiid and LeBron James. Stephen Curry wouldn\u2019t be a terrible alternative to James, and there\u2019s potential for a fun back-and-forth if it were James and Kyrie Irving. Klay Thompson\u2019s humor would keep it interesting, but he doesn\u2019t have much of a shot at being the No. 1 vote-getter in the West. Sekou Smith :  If we wanted to see NBA Twitter explode with the Petty Olympics, we\u2019d get Kevin Durant on one side and Joel Embiid on the other. Talk about pure entertainment \u2026 I\u2019d sign up for that right now. And I think the fans would love every single troll-filled second of that All-Star draft. That said, a LeBron James-Kawhi Leonard matchup is probably a much more realistic probability. And that\u2019s fine.

We\u2019ll probably all get statues here in front of the Chase Center,\u201d Durant told Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ll be Bay Area legends forever, meaning that people will recognize this team and this run forever in this area. Steve Kerr is going to be immortalized and he\u2019ll be a legend forever. Bob Myers, as well, and Joe Lacob.\u201d A few Warriors players are probably considered locks to get their jerseys raised to the rafters already, with All-Stars Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green having won three championships with the team. Curry, labeled by some as the greatest shooter of all-time, could retire tomorrow and most likely still have a statue outside the arena. Durant, however, believes a three-peat would cement his case and be celebrated for many years to come. \u201cYeah, I mean that\u2019s what I think about. I think that\u2019s going to happen. I think about 50 years from now when they have our whole team on the Chase Center floor, or wherever the arena is at that point, all the fans will be cheering for us and reminiscing on those days.\u201d The last team to complete a three-peat was the Los Angeles Lakers (2000-02), followed by the Chicago Bulls (1996-98, \u201991-93) and Minneapolis Lakers (1952-54). The Boston Celtics hold the all-time record for consecutive NBA titles with eight, winning them every year from 1959-66. * * *"},{"id":36987,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-exits-pistons-sixers-game-groin-strain","date":"2018-12-12","title":"Butler exits game vs. Pistons with groin strain","content":" Philadelphia 76ers swingman Jimmy Butler left Monday\u2019s game against the Detroit Pistons due to a groin injury after logging nine minutes of action and will not return.

Current stars and Legends, Jermaine O\u2019Neal, Dikembe Mutombo, Julius Erving, Jim Jackson, Caron Butler, Sam Perkins and Michael Finley, joined forces for a week-long trip that combined the history, passion and culture of China into an unforgettable experience. \u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBeing amongst so many of the all-time greats and to be able to enjoy that camaraderie and share this experience with them was incredible.\u201d The reaction to the NBA\u2019s arrival in China was spectacular. The energy, size of crowds and the pure joy and excitement from the thousands of fans that welcomed the NBA\u2019s arrival to their city was something that had to be witnessed first-hand. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled so much internationally on behalf of the NBA, so I see a lot of it,\u201d said Butler. \u201cIt amazes you when you are there in it. No one can describe what it is like. You need to be there, in the moment, to truly get a sense of the magnitude.\u201d As part of the trip, the Legends took part in a series of fan and partner events. Fan Appreciation Day, which took place in Shanghai, gave fans the chance to interact with their favorite NBA stars and Legends in a game-like atmosphere. For Butler, who has been to China and overseas numerous times on behalf of the association, said that this experience was really special. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to honor and pay respects to the legacy of the game and the people that paved the way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cFrom my experience this year in China, it\u2019s pretty special to see the wealth of young talent that recognizes the history of this game.\u201d The growth of the NBA on a global scale can\u2019t go unnoticed; the impact\u2026undeniable. From an international perspective, the focus has shifted to youth and growth in key regions around the world. The game\u2019s international appeal, combined with the NBA\u2019s savviness and forward-thinking, have combined to create a fan base in China that is hungry for more basketball. \u201cEvery time I go to China, I see the intensity and wealth of fans over there,\u201d said Butler. \u201cIt continues to grow and there is no indication of declining. The production was amazing. It was impressive to see the display of production by the Association.\u201d For the Legends to continue to be a part of the game and events like this is special. But above all, the most rewarding part was seeing the reaction from fans and the joy that they can bring to people. Nothing was more special than that. \u201cTo see the faces of those young people, the fun that they were having, it reemphasizes why we do what we do,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cTo be a part of that and to still feel like we are making an impact is an incredible feeling and something I want to continue doing.\u201d"},{"id":36991,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bulls-boylen-need-move-together","date":"2018-12-11","title":"Bulls, Boylen need to move on from turmoil together","content":" Enough already with the intangibles. The Chicago Bulls and coach Jim Boylen need to focus on the tangibles of what\u2019s left of this season or risk losing something worse than an unseemly number of basketball games. They risk losing their reputations. The Bulls were mired in intangibles for more than a week, and it went horribly. When the Bulls fired Fred Hoiberg on Dec. 3, VP of basketball operations John Paxson cited an absence of \u201cpassion,\u201d \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d as the overriding \u2014 yet intangible \u2014 reasons. Urgent ones, too, because the Bulls didn\u2019t even wait to give Hoiberg a chance to work with a semblance of a full roster. Stretch big Lauri Markkanen played his first game just two days before the firing. Point guard Kris Dunn (strained left knee) and forward Bobby Portis (strained right knee), returned Monday night against the Sacramento Kings. Boylen revved up and muscled up with a little training-camp-in-December. He reportedly ran practices that lasted well over two hours \u2014 once, twice, three times in the first four days. He hit the Bulls with a heavy dose of conditioning work, with suicide sprints and military-style push-ups. He ordered film breakdowns immediately after Chicago\u2019s loss to the Indiana Pacers on Dec. 4 . A two-point upset of Oklahoma City on Friday was followed Saturday by the worst defeat in Bulls history . The 133-77 pasting by the Boston Celtics was humiliating, from the 17-0 hole the Bulls dug themselves to Boylen theatrically subbing out all the starters not once, but twice. Yet that performance wasn\u2019t even the most embarrassing thing the Bulls did last weekend. That came Sunday, when players reportedly considered boycotting Boylen\u2019s scheduled practice. A couple of them initiated a group text late Saturday to muster support for the resistance \u2014 they thought it was \u201cexcessive,\u201d Boylen later told reporters, to practice after a back-to-back and on the lone slack day in a stretch of three games in four nights. (Both are contrary to common NBA work schedules). They allegedly even contacted the National Basketball Players Association to see if union rules were being violated (they were not). \u201cThis is not a negotiation,\u201d Boylen said. The ringleaders were described in some Chicago media reports as \u201cveterans,\u201d which narrows the list of suspects quickly \u2014 only four Bulls players have as much as four years of NBA experience. Robin Lopez, 30, specifically was mentioned as a vet who slowed the resisters\u2019 roll, telling them how unprofessional they\u2019d be perceived. So, per one team source, the players\u2019 big stand wound up as walking in at 12:15 p.m. instead of the scheduled noon practice time. They did avoid another potential killer workout by instead heading into a players-only meeting, followed by a players-coaches-management meeting after. Then some players got some shots up while a handful played 2-on-2. Per ESPN\u2019s Malika Andrews and Ramona Shelburne on Tuesday, after the players-coaches-management meeting, the idea of forming a leadership committee was discussed . The idea there was that in the future, those appointed to the leadership committee could act as a liason between players and coaches. ESPN also reports that Bulls management is on board with Boylen\u2019s tough-love leadership style and are supporting him as he uses a firm hand to change the team\u2019s culture. All that said, the Bulls spit out the bit against the Kings at United Center Monday. They were outscored 63-33 in the second half and got booed at the end. Again. Hopefully, that now is that. This has been way too much drama for a 6-22 team ill-equipped to handle it at either the coaching or playing level. Boylen got into the weeds of the intangibles that got him promoted. He was dwelling on basketball\u2019s last refuge of scoundrels, hustle factors, because that\u2019s what his bosses apparently value most, as evidenced by their dismissal of Hoiberg. Pushing the players as hard as he did in his first seven days \u2014 and talking enthusiastically about it to the media \u2014 led invariably to players pushing back. They were wrong for doing so \u2014 the leaders on better, more veteran teams would have demanded a practice Sunday after Chicago\u2019s loss. But many of these Bulls players are too young, too inexperienced and too of-their-generation to realize how wrong they were. There was no way anything resembling NBA basketball (never mind the winning variety) could have continued, as raw as things got in the 48 hours or so before Monday\u2019s loss. Now, in the hangover from raw emotions and a pair of regrettable defeats, Boylen can busy himself with the fine points of cleaning up the Bulls\u2019 defense, turnover woes and defense on 3-pointers and side pick-and-rolls. They all can use the itinerary quirk of a brief trip to Mexico City for Thursday\u2019s Global Game against Orlando ( 9:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass ), followed by games at San Antonio and OKC, to do some familiar road bonding. Even the stop to face the Spurs can help, provided it gets Boylen to back off some of his Gregg Popovich references in the presence of the real deal (and the Bulls players stop feeling compelled to remind their coach he\u2019s not Pop). If not quite tranquil, there seemed to be a calming down \u2014 maybe a playing out \u2014 by late Monday. \u201cGood, bad or ugly, I think that ordeal was good for the team,\u201d Bulls guard Zach LaVine said. Said Boylen: \u201cI think it\u2019s a blessing for where we want to go.\u201d Maybe. But like the coach said when asked how a team digs out from such an emotional hole, the Bulls are going to be in \u201cwin the next possession\u201d mode for some time. This group has built no track record and has nothing to lean on, besides some talent. Oh, and all the new passion, energy and spirit. The Bulls and Boylen are stuck with each other, and they won\u2019t become any other team\u2019s nemeses until they stop being each other\u2019s worst enemies. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Entering last night\u2019s game, Golden State ranked 13th in pace (101.05) per NBA.com\/Stats. \u201cI would think the game would get faster and we should be better defensively with Draymond out there,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHopefully we can get some stops and Draymond can push the ball in transition.

After sinking that shot, he playfully challenged the Timberwolves to come guard him. \u201cI felt like a kid in the candy store the last few days,\u201d Green said. \u201cTo come back off a layoff like that, I felt pretty good.

It was a great positive step back for him.\u201d Per Mark Medina of The Mercury News , the Warriors loved a play Green made to close out the first half. Stephen Curry threw a lob to Green, but Green caught the ball and passed out to Klay Thompson for a 30-foot 3-pointer. Thompson sank that basket as the clock wound down in the second quarter to stake Golden State to a 63-57 lead. \u201cRealistically, I was gassed and had no energy to go for the layup.

They played each other 30 times in that span (never in the playoffs), only to fittingly enter Monday\u2019s final meeting tied 15-15. Those clashes sandwiched a four-year run as teammates that included four straight Finals and two championship trophies. * Tuesday On NBA TV:  Re-air of Heat vs. Lakers (4 p.m. ET) The outcome of this bittersweet grudge match wasn\u2019t nearly as important as the memories that preceded it. That much was evident before the game, as both James and Wade reflected on their NBA careers via social media. Those feelings were reinforced when Wade entered the game at the 7:19 mark of the first quarter, as he and James immediately embraced. Though new observers to the Wade-LeBron saga, the Lakers organization and crowd paid immediate homage to the pair of competitors and friends. Fans gave Wade a standing ovation when he checked in. The Lakers later supplied a video tribute. As for the man of the hour himself, Wade showed a little bit of everything against his old friend\u2019s new team. The passing. The crossover. The midair improvisation. The only thing left was the game-winner, which Wade wasn\u2019t able to hit over \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 LeBron. The ensuing scramble left Wade tying to foul James, but with time expired the two wound up embracing on the court one last time. For the first time since Nov. 5, Golden State\u2019s full complement of returning All-Stars took the floor at the same time. That\u2019s a good thing for the Warriors, who are 10-1 in games with Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson all logging time together. When all four share the floor, Golden State shoots 55.5 percent overall, 40.1 percent from 3 and boasts a net rating of 8.8 (which would rank second-best in the league). The fearsome foursome were at their collective best in the Warriors\u2019 116-108 win over Minnesota. Curry rained seven 3s from beyond the arc. Durant (22 points) picked his spots. Thompson poured in four more 3s and 26 points. Green (seven points, 10 rebounds, seven assists) did a little bit of everything. And don\u2019t worry. DeMarcus Cousins will be joining them soon. We didn\u2019t think Boban Marjanovic could be blocked near the rim. Deandre Ayton proved us wrong. Ditto for Anthony Davis fadeaways, which Boston rookie Robert Williams vehemently sent back. Indiana has been without Victor Oladipo\u2019s services since Nov. 19. The Pacers are somehow 6-4 in that stretch after Friday\u2019s win over Washington. How are they winning without their lone All-Star? Indiana has maintained the third-best defensive mark in the league despite Oladipo\u2019s absence, an effort led by their interior defense. The Pacers allow opponents a frigid 33.5 percent shooting clip in the paint (non-restricted area) and are top five within the all-important semicircle (59.8 percent). Myles Turner is the foundation of that effort, rejecting 3.3 shots per game since Oladipo\u2019s injury-forced exit. On the season, opponents are shooting 9.9 percent worse against Turner within six feet of the basket. The former lottery pick swatted five attempts in the first half on Friday, leading Darren Collison to proclaim afterwards: \u201cI think he\u2019s the best defensive big man in the league right now.\u201d Paul George oozed efficiency in the Thunder\u2019s 122-113 win over Utah, scoring 31 points on just 10 shots, including 5-for-6 from beyond the arc. Russell Westbrook suffered the opposite phenomenon, hitting just four of his 18 shot attempts. Not that the Thunder are concerned. Westbrook (12 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists) still got a triple-double and, more importantly, OKC (17-8) sits atop the West. Serve someone in your life the way Luka Doncic serves up assists. Then react like he would \u2014 with sheer, unfiltered joy."},{"id":36964,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/phoenix-suns-sign-big-man-eric-moreland-official-release","date":"2018-12-11","title":"Phoenix Suns sign forward\/center Eric Moreland","content":" PHOENIX \u2014 The Phoenix Suns signed forward\/center Eric Moreland.

At one point, a familiar figure \u2014 tall, bespectacled, in an all-business suit \u2014 headed their way on the hotel\u2019s banquet-hall level. The coach who spotted Kiki VanDeWeghe first quickly alerted his peers. \u201cShhh. Shhh! SHHH!\u201d that fellow said in a stage whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s the PO-lice!\u201d The others turned, saw VanDeWeghe and laughed heartily, as the NBA\u2019s executive vice president, basketball operations, smiled and joined them. It would seem a tricky and potentially awkward thing, being the one who can suspend players and whack coaches\u2019 wallets. But VanDeWeghe handles the duty without much stress on either side and has been doing so since 2013 .  VanDeWeghe, 60, has worked as many jobs, at as many levels, as arguably anyone in NBA history. He logged 13 seasons with the Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, New York Knicks and LA Clippers, averaging 19.7 points on 52.5 percent shooting while making two All-Star teams. In the 25 years since he retired, VanDeWeghe has served as general manager with Denver and New Jersey, with one season as interim coach of the Nets. He worked as a broadcast analyst for two years with ESPN and spent two years with FOX Sports West covering the Clippers. He joined the league office in April 2013 and was promoted into his current position later that year. Beyond meting out fines and suspensions, VanDeWeghe has responsibilities with the Competition Committee, game analytics and game operations, while serving as a liaison between the NBA and its teams. He also holds the distinction of being the top scorer in the highest-scoring game in NBA history . Detroit beat Denver in triple-overtime, 186-184, at McNichols Sports Arena on Dec. 13, 1983 and VanDeWeghe finished with 51 points, nine rebounds and eight assists . With the 35th anniversary of that milestone game fast approaching, VanDeWeghe spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner about the game, the frantic scoring pace that the league seems to be embracing and more: * * * Steve Aschburner:  Three hundred seventy points \u2014 and 80 of them came after the fourth quarter. What stands out for you from that crazy game? Kiki VanDeWeghe b At the time, it was kind of a surreal event. It felt like this game went on forever. The number of overtimes, lots of heroic plays, so there was just tons of drama throughout the game. The Pistons were a tough team. On some level, it was the beginnings of the Bad Boys era. They hadn\u2019t added everybody yet, but they had a core group there \u2014 Isiah Thomas was so tough and [Bill] Laimbeer was Laimbeer, and Vinnie Johnson was the Microwave. SA:  Did you and the others realize you were making history?  KV:  What I remember is how tired everybody was, and how after that game, it was like, \u201cOh man!\u201d Even for a couple of games after that, our team felt it. It was one of those things where you know you\u2019re going through something unique and that it probably won\u2019t happen again, and you\u2019re tired but you\u2019re fired up to experience it. I don\u2019t know if you think you\u2019re making history, but in some small way you get that perspective. At least I did. And it\u2019s sort of exciting \u2013 it\u2019s what you play basketball for, that type of competition. SA:  The astounding thing to me is, four years into the 3-pointer\u2019s NBA existence, each team was 1-of-2 from the arc. Makes me think Golden State and Houston conceivably could top 200 points each. KV:  The pace of that game was right at 112. Currently, we\u2019re just north of 110. So we\u2019re playing at that speed, and the thing we\u2019ve added is 3-pointers. That\u2019s what clearly stands out to me about the box score. SA:  So maybe your two teams could have topped 200, with 63 minutes to work with.  KV:  It did seem like that. Believe me. SA:  By all rights, a team that misses 23 free throws \u2014 Detroit shot 37-of-60 from the foul line \u2014 ought to lose the game. What was it like for your team to score 184 and lose? KV:  It was deflating, I\u2019m not going to lie to you. That was a very tough loss. I thought we had it won in regulation, I thought we had it won a number of times. It\u2019s just a truism of the NBA that if you let a team hang around long enough, they\u2019re going to have a run and you run the risk of losing that game. SA:  Do you remember the points or basket that won it? KV:  What I remember is Isiah Thomas did a lot at the end to win. That didn\u2019t surprise me. He was such a great competitor. If I recall, we were No. 1 in scoring [that season] and it really was a contrast in styles. Detroit was coached a certain way, we were coached a certain way. We scored 184 points and never ran a play. We played a passing game and the only rule [coach] Doug Moe had was, you couldn\u2019t stand [still]. You had to go do something. Well, we did have two out-of-bounds plays, as I remember it. Alex English went 1-on-1 or I went 1-on-1. Those were our two out-of-bounds plays. SA:  You were putting up Hall of Fame scoring and shooting numbers in those days. KV:  Early in my career I was much more of a driver. But later in that year, I hurt my back for the first time. The next year, I hurt it twice, and after that, I couldn\u2019t really jump well. The medical side was so different. Now there is such a focus on health and wellness, and teams are so advanced on rest, rehab, how to get the body back in shape. Techniques are so much better. I think about it all the time \u2013 if we had had that type of focus and advances in treatment. Because I never really got [healthy]. I turned into a jump shooter. I played a long time after that but wasn\u2019t quite the same player. SA:  Four weeks after the 186-184 game, your Nuggets team beat San Antonio in regulation, 163-155. You scored 50 that night. Did that soothe some of the sting? KV:  No. I remember this game. Athletes, they remember the losses and the missed shots, the game-winners that could have been. Those are the things that still haunt you. SA:  So do you think we\u2019ll see that record \u2013370 points, two teams \u2014 broken? KV:  I\u2019m going to say yes. For years I said \u201cNo, that\u2019ll last forever.\u201d But if you look at the average pace the NBA plays at today, if you look at 3-pointers, if you look at shooting at a high level, I do think one of these nights you\u2019re going to see high two high-scoring teams go a couple of overtimes and do it. SA:  No problem with losing a claim to fame? KV:  Look, we remember things fondly and tend to get better with age. But I can tell you honestly, the game has never been better. We\u2019ve never had more stars. We\u2019ve never had better talent. Skill sets. Shooters in our game. Just across the board, the creativity. Like you, I watch a lot of games. And I\u2019m surprised, I\u2019m stunned, I rewind wondering, \u201cDid I see what I just saw?\u201d In many ways, it\u2019s more exciting today. You\u2019ve got the tremendous pace, you\u2019ve got 3-point shots, you\u2019ve got incredible athleticism. SA:  So about your current gig \u2013 is it awkward for you being in charge of players\u2019 and coaches\u2019 discipline? KV:  Most of these guys are really good friends of mine for a very long time. The important thing is communication. Making sure coaches, teams, know what direction we\u2019re headed. We\u2019re very transparent in what we share with the referees. We keep in constant contact with the general managers and coaches. It\u2019s a real sharing of ideas. Obviously people want to win games and they fight for their teams, but when we get together as a group, it\u2019s about the good of the game. These are basketball people, and they want to make the game better.  SA:  Sounds like a legit two-way street, rather than top down. KV:  They\u2019re on the front lines, and we tend to listen. Quite honestly, that\u2019s where most of our rule changes come from. Let\u2019s be honest, this is a little bit of a complaint department \u2014 teams call me all the time \u2014 and the most frequent complaint we got [last season] was away from the ball, freedom of movement, and how to keep the game moving. And the post play, with all the switching that\u2019s going on, that\u2019s gotten a little rough. That\u2019s typically how we get a Competition Committee agenda \u2014 it comes from our teams. SA:  As far as discipline, it seems the league \u2014 with the possible exception of visiting locker-room intrusions at Staples Center \u2014 has built up enough precedent that the parties involved almost know what\u2019s coming, in fines or suspensions. Does that make things go down more smoothly? KV:  We have a clear system for how we deal with things consistently, the same way every time. It helps to have people weigh in. We look at history. We look at comparables and context that matters. We spend a lot of time talking to everybody involved in incidents. We really try to get an idea of what truly happened. I\u2019m proud of where we end up in most cases. And the idea is, it\u2019s much less about punishment than it is about deterring behavior, and making sure players can compete and show their natural abilities. And be safe on the court. SA:  Does the NBA keep an eye on the NFL, NHL or MLB when it comes to discipline and policies, or are things too cooked into the respective collective bargaining agreements to have much crossover value? KV:  We do look at them. It\u2019s different for each league, different rules, and not all of it\u2019s applicable. But we do try to incorporate many times \u201cbest practices\u201d \u2014 if there\u2019s something we see another league doing, and we think \u201cthat\u2019s a really good idea,\u201d we\u2019ll adopt it. That\u2019s one thing [NBA commissioner] Adam [Silver] has been so focused on \u2014 keeping us improving. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be satisfied that you\u2019re doing a good job and everybody seems to be happy. Do better.\u201d That\u2019s a big mantra. And not only [borrowing] from the other leagues but from other businesses. SA:  Your predecessor in this job, Rod Thorn, went into the Hall of Fame this year. Did he give you any advice as you took the job? KV:  Rod was a great relationship guy and still I view him as somebody who\u2019s a mentor and advisor. Rod said, \u201cAt the end, be tough. But make sure you leave \u2018em laughing.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Warriors join the 1980 U.S. hockey team, the 1999 U.S. Women\u2019s World Cup soccer squad and the 2004 Boston Red Sox as the other team honorees. Sports Illustrated announced the winner Monday, and editor-in-chief Chris Stone said they have been thinking of some way to honor the Warriors during their run of three titles in four years. He also acknowledged that there were a couple years where Steph Curry has been in the conversation. \u201cThere is something transcendent about the team where the sum of their parts was apparent from the beginning,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWhat they have built into a dynasty is a function of empirical success. They\u2019re really a generational team. I don\u2019t know if, in my lifetime, there has been a team where the pieces have blended so beautifully together.\u201d Stone also said that the Warriors\u2019 honor is more about the celebration of the organization doing something unique over an extended period while the other teams were honored for what they did in a certain year. Alexander Ovechkin, who led the Washington Capitals to their first Stanley Cup title, Tiger Woods and LeBron James also received consideration, but Stone said the Warriors felt like the favorite when they repeated as NBA champions. \u201cIn the same way they play, they seem to speak in a single voice,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThe unity of message with the Warriors is the same way we refer to LeBron and his answering some of the hard questions. They did it forcefully, but also civilly, in a way that helps advance conversations.\u201d The Warriors will receive the award during a ceremony in Los Angeles on Tuesday that will air on NBCSN on Thursday. \u201cThis is an incredible honor and one that certainly signifies our Strength in Numbers philosophy as a team and organization,\u201d Warriors President of Basketball Operations\/General Manager Bob Myers said. \u201cOur success is due to the contributions of every single player, coach and staff member in our organization; for Sports Illustrated to recognize this unique dynamic is truly special.\u201d * * *"},{"id":36990,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/week-was-nba-week-8-2018","date":"2018-12-10","title":"Recapping Week 8 in NBA: Stars shine bright for Oklahoma City","content":"Take a look back at the week that was in the NBA with a collection of some of the best games, videos, photos, features and more from around the NBA world. * * * Nuggets 106, Raptors 103 \u2014 The Nuggets refuse to go away in the Western Conference playoff hierarchy and the NBA at large. They made that much clear in this road win against Toronto that was fueled by star center Nikola Jokic. He delivered a huge triple-double and hit a trio of clutch free throws to ice one of Denver\u2019s biggest wins to date. Thunder 114, Nets 112 \u2014 Oklahoma City can\u2019t be counted out of any game right now, it seems. Star forward Paul George made sure of that in scoring 25 of his 47 points in an epic fourth quarter that included the go-ahead 3-poiner with 3.1 seconds left. While he wad busy doing that, teammate Russell Westbrook had another triple-double while making some NBA history to boot (more on that below). Raptors 113, 76ers 102 \u2014 After a so-so showing against the Nuggets on Monday, Raptors star Kawhi Leonard atoned for himself on Wednesday against the Sixers. His 36-point effort powered Toronto to a much-needed win in terms of pecking order in the Eastern Conference hierarchy and kept the Raptors as the top team in the overall NBA standings. Lakers 121, Spurs 113 \u2014 There\u2019s little LeBron James can do to amaze anyone at this point. However, his performance against the Spurs in the fourth quarter was one to behold as he dropped in 20 of his 42 points and showed L.A.\u2019s youngsters just what he\u2019s capable of at any time in fueling the Lakers\u2019 win. Warriors 105, Bucks 95 \u2014 This showdown between East and West heavyweights nearly lived up to the hype. The Warriors gave the Bucks a lesson in making 3-pointers and playing defense as they used a key run of both in the third quarter to seal up a critical road victory. Celtics 133, Bulls 77 \u2014 Normally, blowouts don\u2019t have a place on our weekly list of the best games. But a blowout that makes NBA history has to be noted. Boston\u2019s 56-point victory was the largest in franchise history and also tied the NBA record for victory margin by a road team, set by Seattle in 1986. Bucks 104, Raptors 99 \u2014 An up-and-down week for Milwaukee (and Toronto, for that matter) ended with the Bucks\u2019 lesser-known players coming up big. Malcolm Brogdon hit a pair of clutch 3-pointers late to keep Milwaukee from suffering consecutive losses this season. For Toronto, the opposite was true as this marked their first two-game skid of 2018-19. Nikola Jokic (23 points, 8-13 FG, 11 reb, 15 ast, 2 stl in 35 minutes) \u2014 The Denver big man came through time and again against the Raptors, especially down the stretch. The Nuggets likely wouldn\u2019t have won this game without him, especially considering guard Gary Harris missed the majority of the game with injury. | Watch | Video box score Paul George (47 points, 15-27 FG, 6-13 3pt FG, 15 reb, 4 ast in 37 minutes) \u2014 Oklahoma City would sure love to bottle and distribute to its players whatever got into George in the fourth quarter on Wednesday vs. Brooklyn. He scored 20 points and nailed the game-winning 3-pointer to clinch an amazing comeback for the Thunder against a much lesser foe. | Watch | Video box score Russell Westbrook (21 points, 9-23 FG, 15 reb, 17 ast in 39 minutes) \u2014 It isn\u2019t everyday a player can etch his name in the NBA history books and not be the storyline in the game in which that happened. That\u2019s kind of the place Westbrook was in Wednesday, though, as he passed Jason Kidd on the all-time triple-double list \u2026 but teammate Paul George got most of the shine for his fourth-quarter scoring surge. | Watch | Video box score LeBron James (42 points, 15-24 FG, 3-7 3pt FG, 5 reb, 6 ast, 2 stl in 39 minutes) \u2014 Say what you want about the kind of workload James has to carry for the Lakers this season. What can\u2019t be said is that James is unable to handle doing so, even at this stage of his career.

Though he says he doesn\u2019t care, the fifth-year veteran continues to make his case, delivering another impressive performance in what is shaping up to be his breakout season. With All-Star centerpiece Anthony Davis hampered by a hip injury, Randle picked up the slack with 28 points, six rebounds and five assists as the Pelicans defeated the Pistons 116-108 for just their fourth road win of the season. It marked Randle\u2019s fourth straight game with at least 26 points \u2014 you guessed it, all starts in replacement of the injured Nikola Mirotic. Randle is averaging 29.5 points and 11.3 rebounds over that span with a plus 17.8 net rating. Along the way he set career highs in scoring (37 points, against the Clippers) and rebounds (18, against the Mavericks) in back-to-back games. It continued Randle\u2019s trend of performing significantly better as a starter, averaging 24.8 points and 11.3 rebounds in those eight games compared to 17.0 points and 8.6 rebounds in 20 games off the bench. While he obviously gets more minutes as a starter, Randle also shoots roughly three percentage points better from the floor in that capacity. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry has said he doesn\u2019t see himself making a definitive decision between Randle and Mirotic, preferring to choose depending on that night\u2019s matchup. But if Randle keeps tearing it up like a young Karl Malone, Gentry might not have a choice. On the other end of the heat index is Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry, whose recent stretch of frigid play reached its lowest point yet against the Bucks with one of the worst games of his career. Lowry finished without a single point for the first time since March 2013 and only the third start of his career. It marked his fourth straight game in single digits, and continued a stretch in which he\u2019s averaging a paltry 5.0 points on 19-percent shooting in more than 35 minutes over the past five games. Not surprisingly, the Raptors have dropped three of those contests, including 104-99 to the Bucks in a game where even a mediocre effort from their All-Star point guard might have made the difference. Lowry shot 0 for 5 against Milwaukee, all from 3-point range, and has taken 32 of his past 42 shots from beyond the arc. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just couldn\u2019t find the open ones tonight,\u201d said Lowry, as quoted by the Toronto Star . \u201cI\u2019ve got to be a little bit more (aggressive) inside the paint, inside the arc. I definitely do.\u201d Replacing a coach midseason is never easy, but Jim Boylen has had an especially tough time taking over for the recently-sacked Fred Hoiberg in Chicago. After a six-point loss to the Pacers and a two-point win over the Thunder to start his tenure, Boylen saw his team get absolutely mauled by the Celtics on Saturday, losing by 56 points to set the Bulls record for largest defeat in team history and tie the NBA mark for worst home loss. Then came news that the players reportedly usurped his plans for a Sunday practice in order to hold a two-hour, players-only meeting, followed by an additional meeting with the coaching staff. As reported by ESPN , Boylen acknowledged after that gathering that there\u2019s been \u201ca little shock and awe\u201d in response to his aggressive approach, which has included lengthy benchings, tough practices and zero hesitation to criticize his team\u2019s effort, or lack thereof. (A handful of players were reportedly so unhappy with the prospect of another long workout on Sunday after games on Friday and Saturday \u2014 a rarity in the NBA \u2014 that they had to be talked into showing up at all.) Boylen\u2019s aggressive approach stands in stark contrast to the mild-mannered Hoiberg, who was fired last week with a 115-155 record and one playoff appearance in three-plus seasons. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning about each other,\u201d Boylen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still learning how I want it \u2026 and there\u2019s an adjustment to that.\u201d Said Zach LaVine, per the Chicago Tribune : \u201cWe needed to get a lot of stuff off our chest and be transparent. I don\u2019t think the players\u2019 toughness should ever be questioned. I think that\u2019s on us. I think that is a little bit of what we discussed in our meeting.\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich will no doubt blow his latest milestone off as having stuck around for a really long time as opposed to being really good at his job. (It\u2019s both.) But the Spurs\u2019 rout of the Jazz gave him 1,210 career victories, tying him with Pat Riley for fourth all-time. One more win will put him in sole possession of fourth place, trailing only Jerry Sloan (1,221), Lenny Wilkens (1,332) and record holder Don Nelson (1,335).  It couldn\u2019t avert a lopsided loss to the Hornets , but Knicks rookie Kevin Knox joined some rare company with his 26-point, 15-rebound performance. http:\/\/www.nba.com\/games\/20181209\/CHANYK"},{"id":37015,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lakers-pursuing-ariza-trade","date":"2018-12-10","title":"Report: Lakers pursuing Ariza trade","content":" The Lakers are searching for a third party to complete a multi-team trade that would send veteran small forward Trevor Ariza to Los Angeles, ESPN reported on Sunday .

It was in Chicago, June of 2003, site of the NBA\u2019s annual Draft combine, the meet market for young players gathered to someday change the game, when Wade and LeBron had each other at wassup. In some ways, it was an unlikely pairing. One, a teenaged phenom from Akron, Ohio, fresh from the cover of Sports Illustrated and the high school prom who already had a national following. The other, an overlooked underdog from the Chicago suburbs who only became an acquired basketball taste weeks earlier after a searing run through the NCAA Tournament. That day, Wade and LeBron went through the checkup lines for height and weight, vertical leap and whatever else the combines put rookies through and then during a break came the only measurement that counted, when one future Hall of Famer sized up the other. LeBron said: \u201cSome things you can\u2019t explain. Sometimes it\u2019s just chemistry.\u201d Wade said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re young and coming into the league, you find guys you have something in common with, then you continue to link and that\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s organic how we built this friendship.\u201d Some 15 years later, the bond will endure, likely forever. The basketball part, however, ends Monday night after the game when Wade, who\u2019s calling it a career after this season, peels off his sweat-soaked Heat jersey and swaps it for a Laker top belonging to LeBron. It might qualify as the best trade of the NBA season, or at least the most emotional.  \u201cIt\u2019s sweet and sour,\u201d said LeBron, anticipating the moment at Staples Center. \u201cThe sweet part about it is I\u2019ve always loved being on the same floor with my brother. And the sour part about it is that this is our last time sharing the same court.\u201d Brother? How many folks with different blood can call each other that? True friendship is answering the phone at 3 a.m. instead of letting it ring, and reaching for the tab with longer arms, and above all, becoming a mattress when the other guy falls. Those tests were aced throughout the LeBron-Wade bromance that stretched through two Olympic teams, four years in Miami, two NBA championships and even 46 games in Cleveland together but of course was always put on hold whenever they were on opposite benches. This is best placed into proper context by Gabrielle Union, the actress and wife of Wade, who says ever so delicately about her husband in those friend vs. friend moments: \u201cHe wants to kill him. Drop three-balls on him.\u201d Perhaps so, because as Wade says, \u201cyou always want to beat your best friend,\u201d yet their competitive spirit is confined within the baselines and between the jump ball and buzzer. Then the teasing and bragging rights begin by text or call, almost instantly. This arrangement irked the old-school basketball culture, long cringing at the chummy ways of a new generation, believing that most if not all interaction should cease until the offseason, or even better, when careers are done. Wade and LeBron then turned up the volume on that subject when they linked up as teammates with the Heat in 2010, angering the purists and creating, at least initially, a team to be despised as well as respected. Not that Wade and LeBron regret that experience at all, or the noise that followed; this was, as Union observed, \u201cfar bigger than basketball.\u201d The chance to be neighbors and watch their kids grow up together and celebrate championships on South Beach until well past sunrise was a priceless part of the bonding process, something neither will be able to duplicate as they begin a new phase of their relationship. The chance to let their hair down (well, Wade anyway) and loosen up, away from the crowds and the media, is something they could keep to themselves. Although: Mrs. Wade spilled a few friendship secrets the other day, with an ohmigod and a roll of the eyes. \u201cThey laugh a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cLeBron is silly. Dwyane is silly. They\u2019re silly and goofy together. When they\u2019re around each other it\u2019s like a never-ending sleepover. That\u2019s what it feels like when you\u2019re in their orbit. They have an unspoken language and jokes and it\u2019s like a show and everyone\u2019s watching.\u201d It helped that, in addition to being in the same sport, both LeBron and Wade became all-time greats, because like-minded and like-talented people tend to magnetize. It was LeBron who collected MVP awards and a huge social media flock at first, then Wade followed up by winning a championship first, and this created a mutual respect for each other\u2019s abilities. It also allowed them to walk through the same exclusive doors together, for example, making a pair of Olympic teams and a batch of All-Star Games, therefore putting them in close company even before the Heat experience. From those moments, a relationship tightened. And when life threw airballs in their direction, one was there to help the other. \u201cWhen I was going through the custody of my kids and that battle, he was someone I talked to constantly and told him what I was going through,\u201d said Wade. \u201cAnd vice versa, when he was going through things family-wise, I could talk to him and try to relate. You lean on guys who have similar stories and have gone through similar things in their lives to help with advice or just be there to listen.\u201d Curiously, one of their few awkward moments happened when they became teammates in Miami initially. The transition, Wade admitted, was friction-free but not totally smooth. Superstars have egos. Adjustments were needed and were done and this was made possible by LeBron\u2019s game, which is built on unselfish play. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been easier if we went to a neutral site,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut because he came to Miami, it was my team before he got there. It was a little hard because of that, but once we got through the first year it was easy. He can play with anybody. He can go out and score or he can get 17 points and 20 assists. He knows if a guy hasn\u2019t shot the ball in a while and how to get him going.\u201d Their on-court chemistry was astonishing to witness at times, the best entertainment in basketball back then. They knew each other\u2019s tendencies, spots on the floor and how to mesh. How many times did Wade toss a lob to a streaking LeBron for a dunk, or vice-versa? Along with Chris Bosh, this was one of the most productive link-ups in NBA history. Four years and four trips to the NBA Finals don\u2019t lie. And true friendship is following your pal to Cleveland in winter, as Wade did last year in an awkward attempt to re-create the past. To this, Wade shook his head and laughed: \u201cYeah, yeah, you right about that.\u201d While Wade is putting a bow on this retirement season, he marvels at his friend\u2019s staying power and salutes LeBron\u2019s decision to sign up with the Lakers and take on Los Angeles. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, something he wanted to do,\u201d Wade said. \u201cFor a player to be able to map out his career the way he has been able to do, he\u2019s doing it his way. This is the way he wanted, to end it here in L.A., on and off the court. His career is not over, but this is the last layer of his career.\u201d And LeBron, reflecting on Wade\u2019s NBA imprint, said: \u201cD-Wade has definitely had a helluva career, obviously. A first-ballot Hall of Famer, a three-time champion and so on and so on. I mean, it speaks for itself. But what he\u2019s done for that franchise and what he\u2019s done for that community since he\u2019s been drafted has been a pretty good story.\u201d This is curious timing, how the NBA schedule has Wade making his last trip to Los Angeles and against LeBron not long after Wade and Union, who have a home in L.A., recently welcomed a newborn daughter. The families spent Sunday together at the baby shower, then the farewell game tips 24 hours later. Union calls it the \u201cend of a basketball brotherhood but the beginning of a real friendship with basketball gone\u201d and Wade agrees. \u201cWhen we first came into the league people couldn\u2019t understand how we could be friends during the season,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWhen I was in Cleveland for a game I\u2019d go to his house the night before, we\u2019d go to the movies and hang out and then we\u2019d go at each other in the game. We\u2019d laugh about that. We enjoy having a different relationship than what was done before us, but then going out and playing against him, I\u2019d always want to whup his you-know-what. And vice versa. Just the times we shared. The moments when it\u2019s not all been great, but to be able to have somebody to talk to and run things by. A lot of people don\u2019t have a LeBron James to call up and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m thinking about this, what do you think about it?\u2019 That\u2019s special.\u201d What will also be special Monday night is when Wade, as has been his routine after every game this season, swaps jerseys with an opposing player; this will be the 1,001st game of Wade\u2019s dwindling NBA career. \u201cObviously this is something I wanted to do in my last year,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut of all the players in the league, LeBron is one of my closest friends so this one will mean a little more, because of the paths that we both went down as competitors against each other and as teammates. We\u2019ll be linked together forever.\u201d And what might be said between friends and competitors caught up in that moment? Wade offers this: \u201cWe\u2019ll look at each other and say, \u2018Yo, this is it.\u2019 It\u2019s crazy that it happened so fast. We remember the night we got drafted like yesterday. But it comes fast. Just an ending of a chapter in both of our lives.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Hopefully watching. If you weren\u2019t, you may have seen something come across one of your social media timelines. The Slovenian sensation produced all manner of emotions, emojis and omg\u2019s while seizing the spotlight and the win for Dallas over Houston on Saturday night. There was no sign of Doncic\u2019s moment before it was already happening. With three minutes remaining, the third overall pick was mired in a 3-for-13 shooting night, with three turnovers to just one assist. Ball movement opened up an easy corner 3 to pull Dallas within five. Forty four seconds later, Doncic rhythm-dribbled into a step-back triple over Clint Capela. Another 40-ish seconds later, the 19-year-old kept the defense guessing and drove to the basket. Tie game. Finally, Doncic got Capela to switch on him again. The former Euroleague MVP pulled off his most ambitious dribble-step-back sequence yet \u2014 and canned the go-ahead 3. In under two minutes, the score was Doncic 11, Rockets 0 . Mavs fans roared. Social media erupted. The arena serenaded their beloved Slovenian with a well-earned verse of HalleLuka. Not that Doncic minds. That\u2019s his song, now. And Saturday night was his night. Amid the never-ending attention of millions of fans, LeBron James sees the smallest detail. That includes fans and, in this case, even employees on the road. The Lakers\u2019 superstar admitted after L.A.\u2019s 111-88 rout over Memphis that he had noticed one Grizzlies ball girl wearing his shoes every time he had played there. James finally felt compelled to add his own set to the woman\u2019s collection. \u201cEvery year I\u2019ve come here, she\u2019s always worn a very exclusive pair of my shoes,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve always noticed it and I\u2019ve never said anything to her.\u201d This is Year Six of the Lillard-McCollum show in Portland. What happened at the end of Portland\u2019s 113-105 win over Minnesota explains why reboots are so popular. First, Lillard hit a trademark 3-pointer to give Portland the lead. Then McCollum took a Lillard pass and hit the go-ahead triple. The Western Conference will settle into some discernible pecking order at some point. When it does, the Blazers\u2019 familiar formula could be enough to set them above the majority of the pack. The Celtics won on Saturday. By a lot. By more points than any of their storied predecessors. Boston led Chicago 35-17 after the first quarter. By the end of the third, the Celtics\u2019 lead was 33. Garbage time offered no relief for the Bulls. By the time it was over, Boston was the owner of a 56-point win \u2014 a franchise record and tied for the largest margin of victory on the road in NBA history (Seattle also beat Houston by 56 in 1986). The star of the game? Daniel Theis, who registered 22 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and four blocks in his first start of the season.  Dwyane Wade logged at least one more milestone during his swan song season. Already a 12-time All-Star, three-time NBA champion and Olympic gold medalist, Wade joined yet more exclusive company on Saturday when he played in his 1,000th career regular season game. The fifth overall pick from the 2003 Draft joins just 14 other active players who have logged at least that many games, and becomes the 130th overall in NBA history. Of those 1,000 games, Wade has played 894 of them in a Heat jersey. In Game No. 1, he started alongside Eddie Jones, Brian Grant, Udonis Haslem and Lamar Odom.

And he\u2019s unsure what the milestone will mean. Wade is in line to become the 15th active player to appear in 1,000 regular-season games, the milestone he\u2019ll hit assuming he plays Saturday night when the Miami Heat visit the Los Angeles Clippers ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). \u201cI don\u2019t even know the significance of 1,000 games,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a big deal. I think it\u2019s just another number.\u201d The Heat might disagree with that. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra didn\u2019t know Wade was nearing the milestone until earlier this week, and got wide-eyed when told that Wade had appeared in so many games. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy to think about,\u201d Spoelstra said. Nobody has played in 1,000 regular-season games for the Heat \u2013 Wade has played the most, 893 after Friday\u2019s game in Phoenix. But he\u2019ll be the fourth person to play career game No. 1,000 while wearing a Miami uniform, joining Rashard Lewis in 2013, Shaquille O\u2019Neal in 2007 and Danny Schayes in 1996. \u201cHe\u2019s showed an incredible amount of perseverance and resiliency,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThat might be one of the main things that I\u2019ll preach and teach to young players, to be able to show the grit it takes. The second thing, which is just as important about Dwyane, is he reinvented himself and committed so much off the court so that he could perform and be healthy and play how he wanted to play.\u201d The 1,000th game is just one part of a most significant trip to Los Angeles for Wade. His newborn daughter, Kaavia James Union Wade, is there with his wife Gabrielle Union, so the trip to L.A. is a chance for Wade to see them for the first time in a couple of weeks. And on Monday, Wade and LeBron James \u2013 both members of the 2003 draft class, longtime friends, then teammates in Miami and Cleveland \u2013 could share a court for the final time when the Heat visit the Los Angeles Lakers. Wade and James will exchange jerseys after that game Monday. Wade has exchanged several with opponents already this season, but doing so with James will be particularly poignant. \u201cTo be able to have that last matchup, I think for both me and LeBron, it\u2019ll be cool,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a moment at the end of the game to exchange jerseys and talk. When I decided that the jersey exchange was something I wanted to do, LeBron, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony were originally going to be the only guys I did it with. Then it took on a life of its own, but doing it with LeBron, it will be special.\u201d Wade owns most of the Heat career records, is No. 30 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list and has a legacy that was secured long ago.

With Draymond Green sidelined and Kevin Durant having an off night (11 points on 3-of-14 shooting), the Warriors borrowed a page from the pre-Durant playbook to avenge one of their worst losses of the season, beating the Bucks 105-95 in Milwaukee. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson each scored 20 points and hit 4 of 9 from beyond the arc, while Andre Iguodala added a season-high 15 points as Golden State pulled away in the second half with another hot stretch from the 3-point line. The Warriors limited Giannis Antetokounmpo to 20 points and held the Bucks to a season-low 95 points, their first time all season under 100. It was a 3 and D victory for the Warriors, who shot 41 percent (19 of 46) from 3-point range, while the Bucks were just 7 of 39 (18 percent) from distance. \u201cDefense hasn\u2019t been that great, so it\u2019s good to finally put together a game where we hold an opponent to a not so great 3-point percentage,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat did feel really good, I\u2019m not going to lie.\u201d The Warriors return home to face the Timberwolves on Monday and are expected to have Draymond Green back in the lineup. Green missed the past 11 games with a sprained right toe. \u2022 Game of the Day:  Warriors vs. Bucks re-airs on NBA TV at 5 p.m. ET Russell Westbrook was having his way with the Bulls. And then rookie Wendell Carter Jr. introduced himself, denying Westbrook\u2019s attempted poster dunk at the rim. \u201cJust hope I get this,\u201d Carter Jr. said to reporters after the game. \u201cBecause it could have been really, really bad on my end if I didn\u2019t get that.\u201d The block was a key moment in the Bulls\u2019 fourth-quarter comeback. Lauri Markkanen delivered the go-ahead layup in the closing seconds as the Bulls beat the Thunder 114-112 for their first win under coach Jim Boylen. Westbrook finished with another huge triple double (24 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists) as the Thunder dropped their first game to a team below .500. Coming off a string of three games in which he\u2019s averaged just 13.7 points on 33.3 percent shooting, Sixers big man Joel Embiid got the night off against the Pistons. What\u2019s behind Embiid\u2019s mini-slump? Apparently, Embiid has not fully adjusted to playing alongside Jimmy Butler. Here\u2019s what Embiid told Keith Pompey of Philly.com : Embiid acknowledged he and Butler are still learning how to play better together, but he\u2019s concerned about his recent production and wants to help the team succeed. The Sixers are 9-3 since the Butler trade, including Friday night\u2019s 117-111 victory in which Butler erupted for 38 points, six rebounds, six assists and three steals. With Hassan Whiteside in Miami awaiting the birth of his first child, Bam Adebayo made the most of a rare start in the Heat\u2019s 115-98 victory over the Suns in Phoenix. Adebayo surpassed his previous career-high of 19 points in the second quarter and finished with 22 points and and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. Many of Adebayo\u2019s points came on big dunks, including this Shawn Kemp-esque slam over Richaun Holmes. Now in his 18th NBA season, Tony Parker has barely lost a step. Racing down the court with a head of steam on a fast break, Parker stopped momentarily planting his right foot, then spun 360 degrees to avoid a defender and scored on a layup on the other side of the rim. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that move so many times,\u201d said teammate Nic Batum, who also played with Parker on the French national team. \u201cI kind of laughed when he did it. I told him, \u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for that move.\u2019 They changed the rule in Europe because of that move. They now call it traveling over there.\u201d Parker finished with 19 points off the bench to help the Hornets defeat the Nuggets 113-107 , snapping Denver\u2019s seven game winning streak. Russell Westbrook recorded his fourth career game with a triple-double and 10 turnovers. According to the Elias Sports Bureau , it\u2019s the most such games since individual turnovers became official stats in 1977-78. James Harden is the only other player to post multiple triple-doubles with 10 turnovers."},{"id":36992,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/joel-embiid-frustrated-role-jimmy-butler-trade","date":"2018-12-08","title":"Embiid frustrated with role since Butler trade","content":"Coming off a string of three games in which he\u2019s averaged just 13.7 points on 33.3 percent shooting, Sixers big man Joel Embiid was rested Friday night against the Pistons.

As part of the trade, Cleveland is also receiving Milwaukee\u2019s own 2021 first round pick and 2021 second round pick as well as a 2022 second round pick from the Washington Wizards. In exchange, the Cavaliers will send guard George Hill and a 2021 second round pick (Washington\u2019s via Utah) to the Bucks and forward Sam Dekker to the Wizards. In addition, Milwaukee will also receive forward Jason Smith from Washington. \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019d like to thank George Hill,\u201d said Altman. \u201cHe helped us get to the NBA Finals last year and has been a consummate professional on the court and in our community. Both George and Sam Dekker went about their work here with professionalism and class and we wish them the best. At the same time, we\u2019re very pleased to bring Delly back to Cleveland and want to welcome John Henson as well. This deal satisfied several important aspects for us in terms of having both long and shorter term benefits and assets involved. We will continue to look for ways to improve and strengthen our position for the future, while enhancing our ability to compete and grow in the short-term also.\u201d Hill (6-3, 188) appeared in 37 games (all starts) for Cleveland after being acquired by the Cavaliers on Feb. 8, 2018, averaging 9.9 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 27.4 minutes per game over that span. Dekker (6-9, 230), who was acquired by Cleveland on Aug. 7, 2018, played in nine games (five starts) for the Cavs this season, averaging 6.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.22 steals in 18.8 minutes per game. Dellavedova (6-4, 200) played his first three NBA seasons with the Cavaliers from 2013-2016 and was a member of Cleveland\u2019s 2016 NBA Championship team. In 215 career games (31 starts) with the Cavs, he averaged 5.7 points and 3.4 assists in 21.0 minutes per game. Dellavedova ranks ninth in Cavs history for three-point percentage (.398). He appeared in 12 games this season with Milwaukee and owns career averages of 5.8 points and 3.7 assists in 21.4 minutes over 341 games (88 starts) with the Cavaliers and Bucks.

Delly\u2019s back. The Cavaliers have agreed to a trade with Milwaukee that will return fan favorite Matthew Dellavedova to Cleveland along with forward John Henson and a pair of draft picks in 2021. The Bucks will get veteran point guard George Hill and forward Sam Dekker from the Cavs, a person familiar with the deal told the Associated Press. Milwaukee has agreed to trade Dekker to the Washington Wizards for center Jason Smith and a future second-round pick. The deals are pending league approval and could be finalized Friday night, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the teams have not yet had the mandatory conference call with NBA officials. The first-round pick in 2021 is protected, the person said. There was an urgency to get the deal agreed to before 6 p.m. on Friday because only players on rosters by then can be re-packaged in other trades before February\u2019s deadline. Hill recently returned after missing 11 games with a shoulder injury, and the Cavs have been shopping him around for a deal. Dekker has also been sidelined with a severely sprained left ankle. Both Hill and Dekker were at Quicken Loans Arena preparing for a game against Sacramento before learning they were being moved. Dellavedova\u2019s scrappiness endeared him to Cleveland fans during his three seasons with the Cavs, who didn\u2019t re-sign the player known as \u201cDelly\u201d after winning the 2016 title. The Cavs are 5-19 and in transition after LeBron James left them as a free agent this summer, effectively ending Cleveland\u2019s run as an Eastern Conference power. But the Cavs are thinking about the future and by moving Hill and Dekker, they\u2019ve picked up more assets. Cleveland recently traded sharpshooter Kyle Korver to Utah for two picks in 2020 and 2021.The Cavs are targeting 2020 to land a big-name free agent, and should have plenty of salary-cap space to add one. The 28-year-old Dellavedova will get a chance re-start his career with the Cavs. The Australian had been buried on Milwaukee\u2019s bench and is averaging just 1.7 points and 2.4 assists in 12 games. Henson recently underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left wrist. He\u2019s averaging 5.6 points and 5.1 rebounds in 14 games. Hill\u2019s departure will give rookie guard Collin Sexton, the No. 8 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft, more room to grow. The Bucks are getting a 46-percent shooter from 3-point range in Hill, who fits into their new long-range shooting philosophy under first-year coach Mike Budenholzer, plus a backup to starter Eric Bledsoe. They also could potentially save roughly $16 million in salary, assuming that they waive Hill after this season. Budenholzer declined comment before Milwaukee\u2019s game against Golden State."},{"id":37005,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-draymond-green-upgraded-friday-game","date":"2018-12-07","title":"Warriors' Green upgraded to questionable for Friday's game vs. Bucks","content":" If Draymond Green has his way, he\u2019ll be on the court for tonight\u2019s game against the Milwaukee Bucks ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ).

But so is the stuff between the highlights. Here are some things you may have missed from the last week (or so) of games \u2026 For all videos, press the SLOW-MO button at the bottom right to watch in slow motion. Tue. Dec. 4 \u2013 Chicago @ Indiana Last season, the Indiana Pacers were 0-7 without Victor Oladipo. This season, they\u2019re 5-4 (counting the game in which Oladipo was injured in the first quarter). Their win over the Bulls on Tuesday was pretty ugly, but for the most part, their offense has held up without its leading scorer. The Pacers have scored 106 points per 100 possessions over the nine games, a mark that\u2019s well below the league average, but down less than two points per 100 possessions from their mark in 15 games with Oladipo ( 107.9 ). Over those nine games, the Pacers have ranked second in the league in assist rate , having recorded assists on 68 percent of their buckets, up from 55 percent ( 24th ) through their 15 games with their All-Star. Their offense is less dependent on pick-and-rolls and we\u2019re seeing more action off the ball. Here are a couple of examples where they got open shots on consecutive possessions via multiple off-ball screens against the Bulls on Tuesday. On the first, Bojan Bogdanovic and Domantas Sabonis set a double pin-down screen for Doug McDermott, coming out of the left corner. Zach LaVine and Jabari Parker switch that initial screen and Parker stays with McDermott through the second screen. Then Sabonis sets another screen for Bogdanovic, who sees LaVine going under the pick and flares out to the left wing for an open three. Cory Joseph and Bogdanovic set a pair of baseline screens for McDermott, and then Joseph screens for Bogdanovic going in the opposite direction (with Sabonis ready to set another pin-down screen). LaVine switches that Joseph-Bogdanovic screen, but Justin Holiday does not, and Joseph is left all alone under the basket. One shooter on the move can create problems for a defense. Two shooters on the move is even better. Tue. Nov. 27 \u2013 Indiana @ Phoenix & Tue. Dec. 4 \u2013 Chicago @ Indiana Myles Turner hasn\u2019t developed into a second star for the Pacers like many expected, and he\u2019s arguably the second best center on the roster. His pick-and-pop game still too often results in mid-range jumpers and, though he\u2019s got a feathery touch, his 3-point shot has seemingly taken a step backward. He has shot just 21 percent on 1.5 3-point attempts per game this season, down from 36 percent on 2.4 attempts last season . But Turner still presents a threat when he rolls to the basket, and he can make good decisions with the ball. Here are a couple of examples from the last 10 days. On the first, his short roll draws a weak-side tag from Trevor Ariza and as he\u2019s catching the pocket pass from Darren Collison, he\u2019s already identifying Bogdanovic open in the corner for what was the game-winning bucket in Phoenix. On the second play, Turner sets four screens before something opens up. He catches a Tyreke Evans pass at the left elbow, draws help from Lauri Markkanen off the weak-side block, sees Ryan Arcidiacono sinking in from the weak-side corner, and gets the ball to Collison for a corner three. Fri. Nov. 30 \u2013 New Orleans at Miami The dribble hand-off might be the toughest action to guard in today\u2019s NBA. And the Miami Heat have a pretty tough-to-guard DHO combo in Bam Adebayo and Wayne Ellington, a strong-and-skilled big and a shooter with a quick release. Here are three DHOs that got the Heat three buckets in the fourth quarter against the Pelicans last Friday. The first and third involve Adebayo and Ellington. Josh Richardson takes the hand-off on the second one, but Ellington\u2019s presence still factors in. Fri. Nov. 30 \u2013 Washington @ Philadelphia Ben Simmons\u2019 combination of speed and strength is a weapon, not only when he attacks the paint in transition, but also when he stays on the side of the floor and runs into a dribble hand-off. Here are three examples from the Sixers\u2019 win over the Wizards last Friday. Sun. Dec. 2 \u2013 Phoenix @ L.A. Lakers & Wed. Dec. 5 \u2013 San Antonio @ L.A. Lakers JaVale McGee\u2019s presence on the Lakers is more about defense, but he provides one unique element (verticality) on the offensive end of the floor. If he\u2019s given the space to launch from, McGee can catch lobs and finish like few others in the league. He has shot 74 percent in the restricted area, the seventh best mark among 58 players with at least 100 restricted-area attempts . Here\u2019s a couple of plays that the Lakers used to get McGee a lob this week. On both, he sets the second of two pin-down screens. On the first, he then gets a back-screen from the guard (Josh Hart) who set the first screen. On the second, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope never comes off the second screen and instead circles back to set the back-screen for McGee. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He turns 34 on Dec. 30 and is surrounded by teammates who asked for his autograph just a few years ago. Yet is anyone on the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 or the NBA for that matter \u2014 showing more of a youthful giddyup right now than LeBron James? LeBron keeps defying age and the deep mileage on his body while feeding the Kia MVP conversation this season. His latest work of art was a dismantling of the San Antonio Spurs, chopping up the once-proud franchise Wednesday night. James\u2019 20 fourth-quarter points lead an exasperated Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to explain this to anyone who just parachuted in from Pluto: \u201cHave you watched LeBron James play before? He\u2019s LeBron James \u2014 that\u2019s what makes him difficult to guard.\u201d Yes, he\u2019s still LeBron James, even after two tours in Cleveland and a brief-yet-fulfilling stop in Miami. New town, team, uniform, fanboys \u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter, LeBron is building a strong case for being the best ever and, whaddya know, also making a case in the Western Conference for the fast-rising Lakers. All signs point toward a Christmas Day showdown at Golden State which might be for first place in the West. It will also be an anticipated checkpoint meeting with two players \u2013 Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant \u2013 who\u2019ve denied James championships. And speaking of which \u2026 The two-time defending champion Warriors are the latest \u201csuperteam\u201d and in Magic Johnson\u2019s and LeBron\u2019s biggest nightmare, perhaps the last for a long time. If Durant is still on the Warriors this time next season, then the grand plan put forth by the Lakers\u2019 team president and his resident superstar could fizzle out. As brilliant as LeBron looks today, he\u2019s on the clock physically and mentally. Don\u2019t ever dismiss the persistence of Father Time and the competitive patience of the player who didn\u2019t sign up for second place when he came to the Lakers. It often annoys basketball fans when the conversation jumps to the future and handicaps over who will join LeBron next season instead of staying in the present. But such is the reality in a league where free-agent shifts can shape the a franchise\u2019s direction and\/or where the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy lands next. Durant did this three summers ago when he left Oklahoma City (and fellow star Russell Westbrook) to align himself with a more gentler and forgiving star in Curry. Suddenly, the regular season became moot and the question was: how many games the Warriors would need in each Finals before sipping champagne? Durant will once again become the focal point in free agency next summer. The most reasonable guesses point toward him signing with the Lakers, the New York Knicks or him staying put. It really doesn\u2019t matter what players or the media say between now and then, as circumstances can change. However, Durant threw grease on the fire in an interview with Bleacher Report\u2019s Ric Bucher by explaining how superstars may not be keen on playing with LeBron . Here we go again. And, you know, he\u2019s somewhat right about that. It is well documented that LeBron has never convinced another star to sign up. Sure, that\u2019s partly because it would\u2019ve meant moving to Cleveland, something Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade either couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t do. That led LeBron to take his talents to Miami. Bosh, a star previously in Toronto, wrestled constantly with the sacrifices required to be LeBron\u2019s teammate. In LeBron\u2019s second Cavs era, Kevin Love did as well. The ultimate basketball litmus test awaits LeBron as he\u2019s no longer in the snowy Midwest, and his boss is no longer Cavs owner Dan Gilbert. As we\u2019re seeing on a nightly basis, LeBron is still LeBron. (To paraphrase Popovich, good enough to position an average team for big success.) Shouldn\u2019t all that be enough to sway a Durant or another A-list free agent next summer? For now, LeBron and Magic are 0-for-1 in their attempt to debunk the theory that folks are selective when it comes to being LeBron\u2019s teammate. Last summer, Paul George chose Westbrook \u2014 a more ball-dominant star without the rings \u2014 and the Oklahoma City lifestyle over LeBron when he had the chance to jump. George didn\u2019t even give Magic the courtesy of an interview . Kyrie Irving bailed on LeBron for the Boston Celtics after they spent three seasons together and won the title in 2016 with the Cavs. While Irving\u2019s explanation for his exit seems as murky as his ( since refuted ) flat-Earth beliefs, he clearly wanted his own team to lead. In short, the \u201csuperteam\u201d trend is more myth than reality. Other than Miami and Golden State, there hasn\u2019t been a team formed specifically to win championships pronto. Superstars aren\u2019t hopping teams with regularity. Chris Paul left the LA Clippers in a trade to join James Harden on the Houston Rockets mainly because the LA Clippers weren\u2019t willing to give him a max contract. DeMarcus Cousins signed with the Warriors last summer because no other team was giving him the deal he sought . After burning bridges in San Antonio, Kawhi Leonard went to Toronto in a trade. Superstars tend to stay in place, especially if they get their money and their team is in reasonably good shape. Today\u2019s contenders were mostly built from the ground up \u2014 something that\u2019s often true in NBA lore. The Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers, Sixers, Bucks and Raptors (aside from Kawhi) were all organically constructed through the Draft and trades. New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis could be in play next summer if he pouts loud enough and forces a trade. Plus, he\u2019s now repped by Klutch Sports, LeBron\u2019s agency. Still, Davis hasn\u2019t sent out any trial balloons about leaving New Orleans. It\u2019s easy and reflexive to take LeBron\u2019s high level of play for granted because he\u2019s been in the clouds for his entire career. He\u2019s taking a career-high 5.9 3-pointers per game, yet still has burst and attacks the rim with the intent of posterizing foes. He remains a better rebounder, passer, scorer and clutch performer than any of his teammates. LeBron is leading a Lakers team with a young core and marginal veterans without skipping a beat or a game. They\u2019ve been helped by a soft segment of the schedule, helping the Lakers move just a few games from first in the West. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think of them as a top-three or-four team in a season where there\u2019s no clear No. 2 team behind the Warriors. Perhaps the most unselfish scorer in NBA history, his skills should give any marquee free agent reason to sign in LA, right? Maybe someone will \u2026 with the Clippers. They have a great supporting cast in place and will have millions to spend next summer on a star seeking his own team. That would be the ultimate slap in the face: Durant, Leonard or some other star decides to play in Staples Center \u2026 but not on LeBron\u2019s team. It\u2019s all worthless chatter for now. With seven months left before the crowning of the next champion, the NBA season doesn\u2019t play the free-agent game until it must. Meanwhile, LeBron is playing a tremendous game at an age when most superstars begin to develop an ache in their limbs. He\u2019s elevating the Lakers, which is a compelling argument for another great player to ride shotgun with LeBron. But suppose no one wants that seat? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

An 0-4 start to 2018-19 and Westbrook\u2019s arthroscopic knee surgery in September distorted the fact that the Thunder\u2019s marquee stars, fast friends after just one season together, have become one of the league\u2019s most dynamic duos. They\u2019ve led the Thunder out of that hole and into the thick of the chase for the West\u2019s top spot, posting a league-best 16-3 record since Oct. 28 . They\u2019ve found a groove and, in turn, have fueled a revival in Oklahoma City that makes the Thunder one of the NBA\u2019s most dangerous teams. OKC is taking another stab at a 1-2 punch, one that Westbrook and Kevin Durant were as teammates for years \u2014 but this time with a much longer shelf life on the partnership. Westbrook, after all, was the host and emcee at the party last summer where George announced he was sticking with the Thunder in free agency. And unlike the uneasy give-and-take that always seemed to color the Durant-Westbrook dynamic, there\u2019s an easy chemistry already between Westbrook and George, who are both featured prominently in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. OKC\u2019s thrilling comeback win Wednesday in Brooklyn provided a fine example. On a night when Westbrook logged his 108th career triple-double (21 points, 17 assists and 15 rebounds) to pass Jason Kidd on the all-time list , it was George who closed the show. He scored 25 of his season-high 47 points in the fourth quarter as Westbrook went scoreless and played set-up man for George\u2019s late-game heroics. Westbrook got the assist on the game-sealing 3-pointer George nailed in the final seconds, capping a 6-for-13 night on 3-pointers for George. George\u2019s virtuoso performance (he also had 15 rebounds, four assists, a block and just two turnovers) \u2014 the kind Westbrook has authored so routinely over the past two seasons \u2014 served as another reminder that the Thunder once again have two of the NBA\u2019s best two-way players. Missing this time, however, is the chatter about whose team it is and who is the real alpha on the roster. Westbrook is once again averaging a triple-double (22.7 points, 10.1 rebounds and 10 assists per game) while George leads the Thunder in scoring (24.3 ppg) and minutes (34.8) to go along with 8.1 rpg and 4.3 apg. They appear to be a much better fit personality-wise than Westbrook and Durant ever were. There\u2019s no tug-of-war, real or imagined, or a power struggle on the horizon. For OKC\u2019s duo and their constantly improving supporting cast, the only thing on the horizon is the endless potential of one of the NBA\u2019s most dangerous tandems. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.4 point, 7.6 rebounds, 6.6 assists, 1.3 steals James is wise to dismiss the criticism, veiled or otherwise, from Kevin Durant and others trying to poke holes in his body of work with the Lakers . He\u2019s been nothing short of brilliant in powering the Lakers out of their lottery abyss and into the thick of things in the Western Conference. And make no mistake, if there are indeed media \u201cfan boys\u201d trumpeting LeBron\u2019s game these days, it\u2019s warranted. And if you don\u2019t believe it, ask San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich what he thinks after witnessing LeBron\u2019s 20-point fourth quarter destruction of his team Wednesday night at Staples Center . LeBron\u2019s 42 points (on 15-for-24 shooting and 4-for-7 on 3-pointers), six assists, five rebounds and two steals were the latest reminder he\u2019s there to provide whatever the Lakers need in their resurgence. LeBron is wise to ignore all the outside chatter \u2026 he\u2019s got more important business to tend to these days, anyway. Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  30.2 points, 5.7 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.3 steals Well, that didn\u2019t take long. Three games was all it took for Curry to dive right back into a rhythm for the two-time defending-champion Warriors. For anyone wondering how Curry could maintain a spot in the top 10 on this list while missing 10 straight games with a groin injury , go back and watch what he\u2019s done in the three games since he returned (33.3 ppg, 53.4 percent shooting, 54.5 percent 3-point shooting, 5.6 rpg, 4.3 apg and 1.3 spg). The Warriors, a .500 team without Curry, have quickly stabilized their situation with him back on the floor. As usual, he\u2019s creating an on-court dynamic that only he can for Golden State. Now you know why the Warriors didn\u2019t sweat their struggles, on and off the court, knowing that the remedy for what ailed them was coming. He scored 42 points (and nine 3-pointers), grabbed nine rebounds and dished out seven assists in Wednesday\u2019s Finals \u201crematch\u201d in Cleveland , proving once again that the Curry fear factor for foes is as profound as ever. Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  26.1 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.8 steals For a man of so few words, Leonard has had no problem making his presence felt in Toronto this season, particularly in marquee matchups. The Philadelphia 76ers found out firsthand Wednesday when Leonard and the Raptors took the Sixers apart in a matchup of teams that could very well see each other in the 2019 East finals. Leonard dominated everywhere, shredding the Sixers for 36 points, nine rebounds and five steals. It\u2019s crazy to think some people actually doubted Leonard and questioned whether or not he could return to form after his nine-game final season with the Spurs in 2017-18. Leonard has been nothing short of spectacular in the Raptors\u2019 matchups against other contenders. And he\u2019s embraced the individual challenges as well, constantly going head-to-head with the best of the best. What\u2019s the difference for these Raptors, who ended last season atop the Eastern Conference standings and find themselves there again? It\u2019s a healthy and determined Leonard. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  27.0 points, 13.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.3 blocks The Bucks took care of business Wednesday night against the Detroit Pistons . But Antetokounmpo, who spent the past month at the top of this list, turned in one of his more pedestrian performances this season. He only took 12 shots, making half of those and finishing with 15 points, eight rebounds, five assists, a block and a steal. There was nothing particularly freaky about his effort. Perhaps he is still smarting from being on the wrong end of the highlight Knicks guard Mario Hezonja delivered. That facial and step-over irked Antetokounmpo and he vows to avenge it when the opportunity presents itself. Then again, maybe the big fella was due for an off night after posting eight straight double-doubles before dealing with the Pistons\u2019 big man duo of Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. The fact is, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer will need to manufacture more production from the other members of his frontcourt rotation on those rare nights when Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t operating at his absolute best. And the Bucks will need him to take his game to that next level tonight with the Golden State Warriors making their lone trip to Fiserv Forum this season ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2 blocks Embiid\u2019s reputation as one of the league\u2019s preeminent trash talkers extends to more than just the competition or opposing fans. Embiid isn\u2019t afraid to turn his ire on the man in the mirror. And after he struggled mightily Wednesday night against the Toronto Raptors , he summed up his own performance without any sugar coating. \u201cI sucked,\u201d he told reporters after barely reaching double-digit scoring with 10 points (on 5-for-17 shooting) and finished a game more than 10 points below his scoring average for the third straight time. Sure, he grabbed 12 rebounds, dished out five assists and blocked two shots. But he also turned the ball over four times and got into foul trouble. Raptors big man Jonas Valancuinas used his size and strength to bother Embiid. And while Jimmy Butler (38 points), J.J. Redick (25 points) and Ben Simmons (11 assists, 10 rebounds, eight points) all played up to the moment, Embiid came up woefully short, admittedly playing like, \u201ctrash for the past few games.\u201d Still, the Sixers are trying to find their way in a competitive race for top four spots in the East. * * * The Next Five 6.

As concerning as the news might be for Celtics fans, Irving didn\u2019t seem too worried about the injury after the game. He left the game with 3 minutes, 34 seconds left in the fourth quarter and had ice on his shoulder as he watched the rest of the Celtics\u2019 win. Per ESPN\u2019s Tim Bontemps , Irving did his walk-off interview with the ice on his shoulder, but by the time Irving talked in the locker room, he had nothing on his shoulder. \u201cIt was just a weird play at the end of the game,\u201d Irving told reporters after the game. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I got caught up as I was trying to get the ball out and pass it to Marcus [Smart] for a 3. It just caught me weird on my shoulder. So it\u2019s probably an AC joint or something like that. I\u2019m not diagnosing myself, I\u2019m pretty sure. I saw the doctors afterward and they said AC joint or something going on there, but I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Irving\u2019s injury occurred with about 4 minutes left in the game and the Celtics ahead 114-97. He drove into the right side of the paint, but was met by a pair of New York defenders who attempted to trap him. Irving passed out to Marcus Smart on the right wing, who put up a 3-pointer that missed. Irving retreated to the right baseline as Smart was shooting and seemed to be trying to loosen up his shoulder. The Celtics got the offensive rebound off Smart\u2019s miss and worked it back around to Irving, who played for another minute or so before being subbed out of the game. Overall, Irving was solid against the Knicks, finishing with 22 points on 9-for-15 shooting while also logging eight assists."},{"id":37024,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-12-6-2018","date":"2018-12-07","title":"About Last Night: Jazz win one for Rudy","content":" If the Jazz or their fans were waiting for extra motivation against reigning Kia MVP James Harden and the Rockets on Thursday night , they got it just 167 seconds after tipoff. Two early fouls saw Rudy Gobert headed to the bench. Despite being fined for comments about officiating just days earlier, the French seven-footer gave full vent to his frustration. Gobert was immediately ejected, leaving Utah short one reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year against one of the league\u2019s most potent offenses. So the Jazz, spurred by a fan base suddenly frothing at the mouth, responded by dominating the game in every aspect. Without Gobert. With only six points from Donovan Mitchell. Derrick Favors (24 points, 10 rebounds) filled in for Gobert and then some. Joe Ingles further cemented himself as a fan favorite with physical play and versatility. Utah\u2019s beard (Ricky Rubio) cancelled out Houston\u2019s beard (Harden). And though he wasn\u2019t on the court, Gobert managed to enjoy the entire show \u2014 and work in a good sweat in the process.  As fate would have it, the Jazz won by 27 \u2014 despite the absence of their No. 27. Two nights after being outscored 36-9 in the first quarter, Phoenix was blitzed by the Blazers 34-9 in the same span. The back-to-back bad starts set a new precedent of historic futility. To be fair, the Suns have been playing without their top two scorers (Devin Booker, TJ Warren), both of whom are out due to injury. Still, it\u2019s hard times for the once-proud franchise. The Suns (4-21) are off to their worst start in franchise history. Their star player is hurt. They haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2010 or had an All-Star since 2012, both the longest such stretches in team history. In times such as these, it\u2019s usually safe to say there\u2019s nowhere else to go but up. We\u2019re hoping that\u2019s the case. On the flip side of Suns-Blazers, Jake Layman had himself a career night well before halftime. The former second-round pick scored 15 points on a perfect 6-for-6 shooting in the first quarter, including a pair of unlikely heat-check 3-pointers. Layman, who hadn\u2019t played since Nov. 23, finished with a career-high 24 points in 27 minutes Jayson Tatum is an effortless scorer. Seriously, he doesn\u2019t even have to try. He can even get buckets by accident.

That\u2019s where Spurs coach Gregg Popovich listened intently, perhaps a bit incredulously, as Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer talked to him again about forward Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cWhat was it Bud said?\u201d Popovich paused, recalling their conversation a couple days later. \u201cHe compared him to Timmy. Just in the way he leads, how he comes to work every day and how the other players see and respond to that.\u201d The lofty Tim Duncan comparison for Milwaukee\u2019s versatile, young star \u2014 so casually offered by Budenholzer, the former Spurs assistant, and so calmly affirmed by Popovich \u2014 was the headline of that particular chat. But the subtext was in their reference to \u201cthe other players,\u201d without whom Duncan\u2019s Hall of Fame-worthy tenure in San Antonio \u2014 and thus, Popovich\u2019s and Budenholzer\u2019s time there, too \u2014 might have been dramatically different.  Were it not for Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker, the two All-Star teammates with whom Duncan formed an organic and enduring threesome, the stoic master of fundamentals might have grown lonely in San Antonio. Once David Robinson clocked out, Duncan could have wound up like Anthony Davis in New Orleans or Kevin Garnett in Minnesota \u2013 a great player shouldering too much of the load. Rumors might have gained traction and, who knows, the Spurs\u2019 legendary big man might have left in mid-career for Orlando ( which nearly happened in 2000 ) or some other greener pasture. The Antetokounmpo parallel matters. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is the Bucks\u2019 (and potentially the league\u2019s) MVP this season. But Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe arguably are Milwaukee\u2019s most important players for whatever regular season and playoff success awaits. Because without them, Antetokounmpo is just another generational talent without enough help, playing in a crowd of defenders. And \u201cwithout them\u201d is a very real possibility. Eleven seconds remained in a tie game against the Chicago Bulls when Bledsoe drove and got the ball to Brook Lopez. The veteran big man, so comfortable working from the perimeter this season, had a little trouble inside. Lopez missed a layup and two frantic taps at it. Bledsoe, at 6-foot-1, calculated quickly that the game might swing on this possession \u2014 against the Bulls! \u2014 and thrust himself upward. Reaching through the trees, he batted the ball back, out, near backcourt mate Malcolm Brogdon. The 2017 Kia Rookie of the Year thought \u201cshoot,\u201d but had a Chicago defender rushing toward him. So, Brogdon shoveled the ball to Middleton just outside the 3-point line. Middleton, Milwaukee\u2019s second-most prolific scorer, hadn\u2019t attempted a shot in nearly 16 game minutes. He was 1-for-4 in the second half, 5-for-12 overall then. No worries. Middleton\u2019s good look turned into a great moment for the Bucks, his shot from 26 feet lifting them to a 116-113 victory . Now imagine this play next November. Ball rolls aimlessly on the court at Fiserv Forum until a Chicago player picks it up. Antetokounmpo, alone on the right wing, watches helplessly. His teammates from that moment? Gone. It seems like a Bucks fan\u2019s bad dream, but four-fifths of Milwaukee\u2019s starting lineup \u2014 Middleton, Bledsoe, Lopez and Brogdon \u2014 will be free agents this summer. The finely tuned supporting cast so meticulously assembled and nurtured by general manager Jon Horst and Budenholzer could unravel seemingly overnight come July. And leave Antetokounmpo, the ultimate drive-and-kick force this season, without anyone of proven value to pass to. \u201cIt is our mission statement,\u201d Horst told NBA.com about the imperative to surround Antetokounmpo with the right supporting cast, not just one season at a time but long-term. \u201cWhat Giannis means to our team, our franchise, our city, our state kind of goes beyond words. We have to make the most of the opportunity to find and build things that fit with him.  \u201cWith \u2018Bud,\u2019 we have a style of play that fits Giannis and a coach who, in the person he is and the mentality, the passion, fits. And I think we have a great, great core group of guys that fit him. \u201cWhatever you look at doing, of course you consider talent. Of course you consider character. And there are different ways to fit guys around Giannis. But the No. 1 thing we have to consider in every decision we make \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done \u2014 is how does it fit the system we\u2019re playing in and the superstar we have.\u201d Secondary stars might sound like an oxymoron. But in today\u2019s NBA, it takes a constellation. Bledsoe and Middleton have been flirting with breakthroughs for some time. This season, ironically, it\u2019s their contributions toward the sum of the parts and Milwaukee\u2019s team success that might widen the spotlight enough for them to max out \u2026 and cash in. Middleton has been Antetokounmpo\u2019s wingman for all six of his freakishly skilled NBA seasons. They arrived one month apart in the summer of 2013, the skinny unknown Antetokounmpo from Greece as the 15th pick in that June\u2019s draft. In July, the quiet, small forward Middleton arrived one year removed from Texas A&M. Reluctantly, the Detroit Pistons included Middleton after his promising rookie season in the Brandon Jennings-Brandon Knight trade . Three years older than Antetokounmpo and far more ready for the NBA stage, Middleton helped initiate the younger man into the ranks, on and off the floor. Their stars finally crossed in 2016-17 \u2014 that\u2019s the season in which Antetokounmpo played in his first All-Star Game, while Middleton didn\u2019t play until February due to a severe hamstring injury . He appeared in only 29 games and misfired through a bumpy first-round loss to Toronto . The soft-spoken, 6-foot-8 native of Charleston, S.C., however, was back to his reliable, jump-shooting self last season. And this season, Middleton\u2019s adjustments to Budenholzer\u2019s game plan has led the way in Milwaukee\u2019s transformative floor-spreading. One of the league\u2019s top mid-range scorers has tamped down that aspect of his game from 36 percent of his field-goal attempts last season to 14.5 . And at the coaches\u2019 urging, instead of taking one or two dribbles inside the arc, he has been taking one or two steps back. He\u2019s on pace to shatter his personal best in 3-point attempts, projecting to 580 vs. the 407 he launched last season. His scoring and his shots are down slightly, and there are two months worth of games to go. But Middleton might have a legit chance to an All-Star berth if the Bucks\u2019 record remains gaudy enough to merit a second rep. What grabs Middleton most about the Milwaukee journey he\u2019s had? \u201cJust how much we\u2019ve grown,\u201d he said after a recent shootaround. \u201cFrom winning 14, 15 games to now becoming a championship-caliber team in six years. It takes time. \u2026 It\u2019s just a process that some guys got to go through, some guys don\u2019t. But to be on the bottom with this team and now be on the rise, it\u2019s pretty cool to see and look back on.\u201d It\u2019s rarely linear, too. Middleton\u2019s time with the Bucks has had its bumps, from his thigh injury to seeing his Pistons pal, big man Greg Monroe, wash out as a ballyhooed free-agent signing in 2015 . This week has been an odd one for Middleton, too. He got benched for the fourth quarter and overtime of the loss in New York Saturday after Budenholzer didn\u2019t like Middleton\u2019s defensive effort during a pivotal stretch. The two reportedly spoke that night, then hashed things out more completely before Monday\u2019s practice.  \u201cWe talk a lot about having high-character guys and high-IQ guys,\u201d Budenholzer told reporters, \u201cand I think that\u2019s one of the characteristics of those types of people or players that if and when something doesn\u2019t go their way, their reaction usually is to come back and fight harder, dig deeper, do more.\u201d Said Antetokounmpo: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being pissed off at your coach for keeping you out. It\u2019s about being pissed off at yourself. Khris is a really competitive guy and he wants to be there. He wants to do whatever it takes to win, and I think he was just really, really pissed at himself for letting himself down and the team down. Khris is going to come back stronger.\u201d Except that barely an hour before Milwaukee\u2019s home game Wednesday against Detroit, a 115-88 victory, Middleton was scratched as a no-show for what was termed \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d No one was alleging any lingering resentment from the Knicks benching, but it served as a reminder of how fragile a player\u2019s game or a team\u2019s chemistry can be. And of how fleeting a season can be, too. \u201cWe all know [Giannis] needs each and every one of us,\u201d Middleton said last week. \u201cI know I need Giannis and everybody else. We\u2019ve definitely bought into each other. We know we need each other to win big and do the things we want to do.\u201d As for this summer and the possibility of a max contract offer that would end all this Milwaukee goodness, the 27-year-old said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to dive too deep into that now. I\u2019ve still got a lot to accomplish this year. If it\u2019s necessary, change has got to be made. Right now, hopefully, it doesn\u2019t get to that point.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Antetokounmpo who had to pick up Middleton\u2019s slack Wednesday night. It was Bledsoe as well, who scored a season-high 27 points in 26 minutes against the Pistons. He had 11 in the first quarter and nine in the third , enough that he could sit out the fourth. Defensively, he was the tip of the Bucks\u2019 spear that limited Detroit to 37 percent shooting. A year ago, Bledsoe \u2014 whose Twitter desperation to get out of Phoenix went viral \u2014 rolled into Milwaukee like a storm cloud. He was late to the party, having started the season with the Suns, and it wound up not being much of a party anyway at 44-38, with a coaching change from Jason Kidd to Joe Prunty halfway through. Now, Bledsoe\u2019s scoring (16 ppg) and field-goal attempts (11.7) are down, but his efficiency is up . He\u2019s shooting a career-best effective field-goal percentage of .593 and while his rebounds and assists are up from 2017-18, his turnovers down. Like Middleton, the point guard has re-aligned his offense. Approximately 40 percent of his shots have come at the rim, compared to 32 percent last season . Another 40 percent are coming from the arc, the biggest share in his nine NBA seasons. \u201cEric is just in a really good place,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s understanding what we need in different moments. \u2026 He\u2019s attacking in transition and making big plays there. He\u2019s kind of laying it on the line and I think everybody\u2019s kind of feeding off that.\u201d Defensively, Bledsoe\u2019s mix of strength and explosiveness have hindered opposing guards as much as the Bucks\u2019 spread floor has enabled his. Budenholzer dialed that into his schemes soon after he was hired, although some of the chaos Bledsoe creates at that end is his alone. Said the coach: \u201cThere are times when I watch him and think, \u2018That\u2019s not what we told you to do. But it\u2019s kinda good.\u2019 I would say he\u2019s playing on some instinct, it looks like, defensively.\u201d  This has been the guy Milwaukee hoped it got early last season when it traded Monroe and two Draft picks for him. That Bledsoe, though, played more like a square peg trying to jam into a round hole, recklessly throwing away the ball or jogging back on defense. This one (whose wife and kids are in town with him this time around) fits. \u201cHe had a lot of bad habits he just had to let go,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cHe played the best he could for the situation. This year, he\u2019s being a lot more engaged. Knowing what we\u2019re wanting to do, knowing how we want to play, knowing how to run the [team].\u201d Said Antetokounmpo: \u201cIt\u2019s easier. Last year I was trying to figure out how Bledsoe plays, what he likes and what he does well. This year I know what he wants to do. I know when he\u2019s going to pass me the ball. I know when you\u2019ve got to give him the ball and get the hell out of his way to make a play. He\u2019s way more aggressive. And looking for his shots.\u201d Bledsoe sloughs off the praise, claiming it\u2019s simply a matter of playing hard and with great teammates. But he did admit, \u201c[I] love being here. I knew it was going to take some time for us to gel.\u201d Bledsoe\u2019s shift in stats is more likely to help him at contract time than in All-Star balloting. His game is in sync with his team\u2019s for now. Whether his business stays in sync with his employer\u2019s budget this summer remains to be seen. He too has been talked of at various points in his career as a future All-Star. Can that and any other dreams Bledsoe harbors for his NBA career be realized in Wisconsin? \u201cYeah. Yeah. We\u2019re winning,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it a day at a time. Everything else will take care of itself. You take credit for wins, not for stats.\u201d The priority for a team facing such an unusual roster predicament \u2014 80 percent of its starters on expiring contracts or holding opt-outs \u2014 is to compartmentalize. For the Bucks, now is all about the games, the standings, continuous improvement (especially on defense) and where they can take it next spring. Who gets how much, and where and from whom, that\u2019s all for later. \u201cIt\u2019s like anything else,\u201d Horst said. \u201cWhen things are going well, issues don\u2019t matter. And when they\u2019re not going well, issues have to be managed.\u201d So far, contract talk and even competition hasn\u2019t reared its head within the Bucks\u2019 ranks.  \u201cThere are some personnel situations on the horizon, but no one involved would tell you those have any impact on what our focus is,\u201d Horst said. \u201cAnd that is, to have the best season we can have. I think that\u2019s what every guy, to their credit, is focused on.\u201d Between their salary commitments for 2019-20 and the cap holds to retain the rights to their own free agents, the Bucks figure to have only a small amount of space to shop for newcomers. And that\u2019s just from a payroll perspective; it doesn\u2019t address how well any new guys would plug into the system or how long it would take them to properly complement Antetokounmpo\u2019s game. Then there\u2019s the age-old challenge of convincing players, whether in-house or shopping from afar, that Milwaukee can be a viable destination.  \u201cThere are athletes where market matters,\u201d Horst said. \u201cThe excitement of an L.A. or a New York or the size of a Chicago. But I think more often than not, professional athletes want to win \u2014 I really believe that \u2014 and they like first-class everything. \u201cWhat\u2019s great about what we\u2019re building here, we\u2019re showing we can win. We\u2019ve got a superstar who\u2019s committed to this franchise. And now we\u2019ve got this ownership group that has invested in every area to make sure it\u2019s first-class. With the arena, the practice facility, the medical staff, the coaching staff. From the top down, every player who comes to this franchise is going to feel like he\u2019s being treated first-class. If we can combine that with winning and with Giannis, I think we have a chance.\u201d If ever there was an opportunity for a GM to do some gang-negotiating \u2014 getting all the Bucks\u2019 free agents and their reps in one room to hash out a hometown discount \u2014 this would seem to be it. Remember, Duncan, Ginobili and Parker often famously left millions of dollars on the table to stay together in San Antonio. Short of that, can Milwaukee keep all its assets? \u201cThe answer is, absolutely we can keep everybody,\u201d Horst said. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to understand markets and what values are, but we feel very confident that, yes, we can keep everybody if that\u2019s the direction we go. And the sale is going to be the ensemble and what the group can do.  \u201cIs there some sort of give-back or discount that\u2019s associated with that to keep us together? Maybe. But I think, really, in the scheme of where contracts are today, that\u2019s probably fairly marginal. What\u2019s really going to matter is if guys want to be here and see what this group can do together, or not.\u201d That gets back to the Spurs and the challenge of longevity, building something that sustains in an insta-contender, tear-down world. And as Popovich \u2014 who is experiencing the new way this season \u2014 said: \u201cIn this league, you don\u2019t win without talent. But to be the ultimate winner, all the other pieces have to fit around it. The best teams, guys respect each other. Feel responsible to each other. Their games are gonna change to some degree.\u201d Can that ever work again \u2026 in Milwaukee? Keep an eye on the Bucks\u2019 free agents in seven months, on Brogdon and Lopez, sure, but especially on Middleton and Bledsoe. The former could command a five-year, $190 million deal from the Bucks that, temporarily, would trounce the \u201cGreek Freak\u2019s\u201d four-year, $100 million extension signed in 2016. The latter will be seeking a raise from his current $15 million salary and, as he turns 29 Sunday, long-term security heading into his 30s. \u201cI think right now they are our \u2018Tony\u2019 and our \u2018Manu,\u2019 \u201d Horst said, playing along with the comparison. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long ways to go before this group becomes the \u2018San Antonio Spurs,\u2019 but that\u2019s our goal, to build a team that can compete over a long period of time and win championships. \u201cI think they can become and sustain that. Both Khris and Eric are entering their prime or in their prime. They\u2019re super-high character guys. They are very talented. And they fit.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

That same writer then put the Jazz at No. 5 in his preseason Power Rankings , with the thought that their defense would remain elite and their best offensive player would be even better than he was as a rookie. Fast forward seven weeks and the Jazz are 12-13, in 12th place in the West . On Thursday, the Jazz will host the similarly disappointing Houston Rockets (11-12) in the second game of TNT\u2019s doubleheader. The Jazz have taken steps backward on both ends of the floor. Entering Thursday\u2019s game, they rank 23rd on offense , having seen the league\u2019s second biggest drop in 3-point percentage. No team has taken a greater percentage of their 3-point attempts from the corners, but the Jazz rank 26th in corner 3-point percentage (33 percent), having shot better from above the break (34 percent). Their defense, though it ranks 12th , is the bigger disappointment. While the offense has scored 0.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than it did last season, the defense has allowed 4.6 more . The Jazz had the No. 1 defense in the league last season , and after Rudy Gobert\u2019s return from injury in mid-January, they allowed 3.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than any other team (which was kind of ridiculous). The Jazz have suffered similar drop-offs in their defense with the Gobert both on and off the floor. With Gobert on the floor, they\u2019ve allowed 103.0 points per 100 possessions , 5.6 fewer than the league average (108.6). That\u2019s very good, but with Kia Defensive Player of the Year on the floor last season, the Jazz allowed 10.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average. With Gobert off the floor, the Jazz have been worse than the league average defensively, allowing 109.7 points per 100 possessions. Last season, they allowed 3.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average with Gobert off the floor. The Jazz haven\u2019t rebounded as well as they did last season and they\u2019ve also seen a drop in opponent turnover rate . But where the Jazz defense has seen the biggest drop-off is in their ability to defend shots inside the arc. Last season, the Jazz ranked 4th in opponent 2-point percentage (48.8 percent). This season, they rank 20th (52.6 percent) With Gobert protecting the rim and aggressive defense on the perimeter, the Jazz rank third in the percentage of their opponents shots that come from between the restricted area and the 3-point line (37 percent). That\u2019s good, because those are the most inefficient shots on the floor. But Jazz opponents have shot 43 percent on those shots, the fourth highest mark in the league. Last season, Utah opponents shot less than 39 percent, the league\u2019s fifth lowest mark, between the restricted area and the 3-point line. At 43 percent, the Jazz are still allowing just 0.9 points per shot on those attempts. But the little things add up. If Jazz opponents were shooting the same percentage on those in-between shots as they did last season, the Jazz would rank fifth or sixth defensively instead of ranking 12th. The Jazz also aren\u2019t have protected the rim as well as they did last season, when opponents shot 55 percent and 53 percent at the rim when Gobert and Derrick Favors were there to protect it , respectively. This season, those numbers are 59 percent and 56 percent . While the Jazz certainly have to get better offensively to compete with the best teams in the West, if they\u2019re going to be the team many expected them to be, they have to rank in the top three defensively. There is reason for optimism. Through Tuesday, when you take opponent strength, game location, and rest days into account, the Jazz had played the league\u2019s second-toughest schedule. Nineteen of their first 21 games were against teams that are currently over .500 and they\u2019ve played just four games (three against Memphis and one against Miami) against the other nine teams that rank in the bottom 10 offensively . The Jazz have played the most road games in the league (16), and they just got done with a brutal, three-week stretch in which they played 10 of 12 games away from home, making two different trips to the East coast. When asked about his team\u2019s defense last week, Jazz coach Quin Snyder alluded to the schedule and a lack of practice time. \u201cYou can have four guys that are on the same page, but if one guy\u2019s not, you can have a breakdown,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cOur execution is something that we want to see improve. A lot of that is both focus and practice. For us, we\u2019ve always been a team that works hard in practice. And when you can\u2019t practice, you have to do it through film, you have to do it from game to game. And every game\u2019s different.\u201d The Jazz celebrated their return home with a 34-point win over San Antonio on Tuesday, one of the Spurs\u2019 worst offensive games of the season . Thursday\u2019s game on TNT, with the Rockets\u2019 seventh-ranked offense in town, is another chance for the Jazz to prove that they can defend as well as they did last season. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Memphis leads the Southwest Division with a 14-9 record and sits firmly among the West leaders. Jackson\u2019s contributions on both ends of the floor are putting him in some rare company. Check out some of the early superlatives, as highlighted by Michael Wallace in a recent feature on Grizzlies.com : The numbers are impressive, and opposing coaches are taking notice. LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers raved about Jackson before Wednesday\u2019s 96-86 loss to Memphis in which the rookie finished with 13 points and six rebounds before fouling out. \u201cHe\u2019s right there as the best rookie I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Rivers said . \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the Rookie of the Year because he\u2019s had a good year. But he\u2019s going to be special. Like, really special.\u201d Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle \u2014 who saw his team fall in Memphis on Nov. 19 \u2014 said his team was high on Jackson and even eyed him with the No. 5 pick before trading up with the Hawks to get Luka Doncic at No. 3. \u201cVery much, very much,\u201d Carlisle said about targeting Jackson on Draft night. \u201cThere are just varying opinions on who would be best for those top four spots, best with this team or that team, things like that. Jackson has shown it right now, why he was a high pick. It\u2019s not a fluke. The guy is a very, very good player overall and a first-rate defensive player.\u201d Jackson\u2019s just 19 years old, but already he\u2019s growing tired of people telling him how \u201cgood he can be\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t get caught up in the whole potential, how-good-can-I-be, when-I-can-be-it thing,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing that since I was 13. I\u2019ve heard that from every person on earth. So when you hear it, you\u2019re like, \u2018Eh, well, okay. I guess that\u2019s a compliment.\u2019 It\u2019s just a compliment of the work you\u2019re going to put in and the work you\u2019ve been putting in. Just stay the course, do what you do and everything should follow along.\u201d * * * Last week:  No. 1 This was not a great week for the holder of the top rung. After scoring in double-digits in each of his first 19 games , Doncic had clunkers in two Dallas losses. Doncic scored just six points on 2-for-13 shooting (missing all five 3-point attempts) in Friday\u2019s 114-103 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. After missing Sunday\u2019s game with a hip strain, Doncic did bounce back to score 21 points \u2014 including a game-icing stepback 3-pointer \u2014 in the Mavs\u2019 111-102 win over Portland . But the rookie disappeared again Wednesday night, scoring eight points on 2-for-8 shooting (1-for-4 on 3s) as the Mavs were dismantled by New Orleans 132-106. If Ayton or any other rookie had had a monster week, Doncic definitely would have slipped. 2. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns  Last week:  No. 2 With Devin Booker and TJ Warren out with injuries Tuesday night, Ayton had a chance to be the man. Unfortunately, Ayton \u201cdidn\u2019t come ready to play,\u201d coach Igor Kokoskov said afterward. Ayton finished with just 10 points for the second straight game in 21 minutes of the Suns\u2019 122-105 loss to Sacramento . Kokoskov was frustrated, but understanding . \u201cAyton is a rookie, he\u2019s going to hit a wall, he\u2019s going to have bad games, and we\u2019re still here to support him and coach him and teach him. He\u2019s still our future. Nothing changes off one game. He didn\u2019t play an impressive game by any means, but Deandre\u2019s our guy.\u201d 3. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies  Last week:  Not ranked Jackson\u2019s 36-point outburst against the Nets on Friday was a season-high for rookies this season and just the third 30-plus-point game this season by a rookie. (Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young scored 35 in a win against the Cavs on Oct. 21, and Luke Doncic put up 31 in Dallas\u2019 loss to San Antonio Oct. 29.) Jackson was clutch down the stretch, hitting several big shots in regulation to force OT. \u201dHe\u2019s got a big heart, man,\u201d point guard Mike Conley said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the gene to make the big shots in the big time. Man, he is built for it. The shots he made were shots a lot of young guys won\u2019t attempt.\u201d Coach J.B. Bickerstaff loved seeing the 19-year-old step up. \u201dIn winning time, to take those shots, it takes a unique heart, skill, ability and just cold-blooded nature,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201dJaren has that.\u201d Last week:  No. 3 Sexton had another decent week running the Cavs\u2019 offense. In his last four games, he averaged 15.3 points on 41.7 percent shooting (4-for-6 from 3-point land). Sexton held his own Wednesday night against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, scoring 21 points and helping keep the game close before Golden State took over in the second half for the 129-105 win. Sexton was 7-for-14 from the field and hit all three 3-point attempts in the teams\u2019 first meeting since The Finals . Most impressive about Sexton\u2019s week? The point guard had just one turnover over his last two games (67 minutes). 5. Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls  Last week:  Not ranked Carter had a solid week, averaging 16 points, 9.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in three games. Carter scored a career-high 28 on 11-for-18 shooting in Friday\u2019s 107-88 loss to the Pistons and picked up his fifth double-double Tuesday in Indiana with 12 points and 13 rebounds . Things are changing around the rookie big man with Lauri Markkanen back in the lineup and Fred Hoiberg out as coach , but Carter continues to impress on both ends of the floor.  Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings Bagley falls out of the top five after playing just one game before missing the last two while dealing with back spasms. In his lone game, though, Bagley had 18 points and 10 rebounds and was starting to break out. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers The Clippers\u2019 promising young point guard averaged 11 points, 2.5 assists and 1.5 steals in four games this week. Gilgeous-Alexander continues to be steady, hitting 53.6 percent of his shots and only had three total turnovers in those four games. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Young\u2019s poor shooting and turnover troubles continued this week. In three games since our last look, the Hawks\u2019 point guard shot just 33.3 percent from the field, going 1-for-12 from 3-point land. He also had 15 turnovers in that stretch as Atlanta suffered losses to the Thunder, Warriors and Wizards. Kevin Knox, New York Knicks Last week, we featured another Knicks rookie, Allonzo Trier , who is having a breakout season after going undrafted in 2018. This week, it\u2019s Knox who took the spotlight, breaking out for 26 points, hitting 5 of 12 3-pointers, to lead New York to a 136-134 win over the Bucks on Saturday. Knox has drawn plenty of criticism for his early-season struggles, but seems to be getting more opportunities from coach David Fizdale. \u201dIt was good to see the ball go in the net,\u201d Knox said. \u201dIt felt good. Just (have) to keep working (and) never get too high, never get too low.\u201d Miles Bridges, Charlotte Hornets Bridges scored a career-high 16 points in 29 minutes Sunday, hitting 3 of 6 3-pointers and also grabbed eight rebounds in a 119-109 loss to the Pelicans . This followed a 12-point night on Saturday, his first double-digit scoring game since Nov. 3. With Marvin Williams out for the next week , Bridges should continue to more playing time. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 5 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

As the Lakers collected their seventh win in their last 10 games, the storyline was the same: LeBron James did the heavy lifting and set the tone in victory. He finished with a game-high 42 points (on 15-for-24 shooting) to go with five rebounds, six assists and two steals. Over that 10-game stretch , James is averaging 29.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists and shooting 53.7 percent. Still, James has heard some comments over the past week from Lakers legends Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson \u2014 and some comments from Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant \u2014 on how he should play his game. After last night\u2019s win, though, James was asked if his performance was fueled at all by the talk surrounding him of late. \u201cNo, for what? I\u2019m past the [taking things] personal stage,\u201d James said after the game . \u201cI can do whatever. I can have a huge workload, I can have a not so huge workload. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter for me. What\u2019s most important is seeing my teammates make huge shots in the fourth quarter. \u2026 That\u2019s what\u2019s most important to me. I can care less about the narrative about me. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m a staple in this game.\u201d In a story published by Bleacher Report on Wednesday, both Durant and now-Lakers teammate Tyson Chandler both were quoted about why some star players might perhaps be hesitant to play alongside James. Per Bleacher Report\u2019s Ric Bucher, Chandler said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got LeBron, you\u2019ve got to make it all about LeBron. You\u2019ve got to be able to [coexist] with that and fit with that. Who are you, where are you in your career, and how do you fit in? It\u2019s a sacrifice, but it\u2019s a sacrifice for winning.\u201d Chandler made the comments to Bleacher Report a few days before he was waived by the Phoenix Suns and then signed with the Lakers. As for Durant, he said. \u201cIt depends on what kind of player you are. If you\u2019re Kyle Korver, then it makes sense. Because Kyle Korver in Atlanta was the bulk of the offense, and he\u2019s not a No. 1 option at all, not even close. So his talents benefit more from a guy who can pass and penetrate and get him open. \u201cIf you\u2019re a younger player like a Kawhi [Leonard], trying to pair him with LeBron James doesn\u2019t really make sense. Kawhi enjoys having the ball in his hands, controlling the offense, dictating the tempo with his post-ups; it\u2019s how he plays the game. A lot of young players are developing that skill. They don\u2019t need another guy.\u201d Chandler said he spoke to James about his comments to Bleacher Report, which he felt were taken out of context. \u201cWhat I said was, when you have a great player like LeBron, I said I\u2019ve only played with one other player like that, and like Dirk, you have to make it about them because of how talented they are and where they can lead you,\u201d Chandler told ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin . \u201cAnd of course all of that wasn\u2019t put in. It was just, \u2018When you have a player like LeBron you got to make it about LeBron,\u2019 or something like that. However it read. But that wasn\u2019t the full statement. \u201cAnd I just think I don\u2019t like when negative articles come out like that, even if it\u2019s not about my teammate, but about my teammate, somebody who carries teams the way he does, I just think we\u2019re nitpicking. We\u2019re trying to find something negative about something that\u2019s great instead of just leaving it alone.\u201d As for Durant\u2019s comments, James said he wanted to instead see what the reigning Finals MVP said in full. \u201cI would love to see the whole transcript of what was asked of him, the context it was asked of him, why it was asked and the whole thing,\u201d James said . \u201cSo I\u2019m not gonna comment on it because I don\u2019t know the whole thing. That would be stupid on my part. I\u2019m a veteran.\u201d"},{"id":37088,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-12-5-2018","date":"2018-12-06","title":"About Last Night: Thunder stars shine in comeback","content":" Much like a pair of superheroes teaming up to wreak havoc on their foes, Russell Westbrook and Paul George proved unstoppable in the face of a seemingly insurmountable deficit Wednesday at Barclays Center. Just how bleak was the Thunder\u2019s situation against the Nets? Down 23 midway through the third quarter and as many as 20 in the fourth, they were given less than a 1 percent chance of rallying for victory by ESPN\u2019s Game Probability model. But much like Brooklyn\u2019s defense, those odds meant nothing to the Thunder \u2014 and more specifically, Westbrook and George. Westbrook continued his march up the career triple-double chart, passing Jason Kidd for third with 21 points, 15 rebounds and 17 assists. It was triple-double No. 108 for Westbrook, marking only the 34th time in NBA history that a player has totaled at least 20, 15 and 15 in those categories. George\u2019s 47 points and 15 rebounds weren\u2019t as rare, but might have been even more impressive. More than half his scoring output (25) came over the final 7:11, including the go-ahead 3-pointer \u2014 off a Westbrook assist, naturally \u2014 with 3.1 seconds left. Per ESPN Stats , George had previously been 0-for-14 in his career on go-ahead shots in the final 10 seconds. But having watched George torch his team throughout the fourth, Nets reserve Jared Dudley knew it was down before it left his hand. https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRenderNBA\/status\/1070519688273297408 Westbrook then essentially killed the Nets\u2019 final possession with a deflection that left them just 0.1 second to attempt the last shot, completing a remarkable 114-112 triumph for the Thunder. It was a fitting piece of dirty work by Westbrook, who took only two shots while dishing out five assists in the fourth as he gave George plenty of space to sizzle.  Driven by their two superstars, the Thunder outscored the Nets 39-19 in the final period to register the largest comeback since the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2009. Of more immediate concern, it was also their 16th win in 19 outings following an 0-4 start. \u201cThis was a special night,\u201d said George, who missed his career scoring high by one point. \u201cWe came together when our backs were against the wall and we showed who we are.\u201d OKC\u2019s dynamic duo highlighted a score of monster performances: * LeBron James scored 20 of his 42 points in the fourth, leading the Lakers past the Spurs 121-113. * Stephen Curry lit up the Cavaliers for 42 points, including 25 in the first half. * Jimmy Butler outscored Kawhi Leonard 38-36, but Leonard got the last laugh with a 113-102 victory . * Bradley Beal picked up the slack for the absent John Wall with 36 points and nine assists against the Hawks. * Karl-Anthony Towns overpowered the Hornets for 35 points, 12 rebounds and six blocks. And that\u2019s just scraping the surface. Check out NBA.com\/stats for a complete rundown on Wednesday\u2019s top performers. Four straight Finals matchups etched the Warriors-Cavaliers rivalry among the best in NBA history. \u201dIt was historical,\u201d said Curry, whose team claimed three of those four Finals battles, including the final two. \u201dI\u2019ll definitely sit back on the couch in 10 or 12 years when it\u2019s all over and think about what it was like to play (in Cleveland), and how high the stakes were every time we came into this building.\u201d But with LeBron James having departed for L.A. over the offseason, there were no stakes to speak of as the Warriors visited Quicken Loans Arena outside another date on the 82-game schedule. And the defending champions played like it during the first half, trailing by six at the break despite Stephen Curry\u2019s 25 points. But as they\u2019re prone to do, the Warriors awoke with devastating results. Curry added 17 more in the second, and Kevin Durant hit a flurry of 3s en route to 25 points for the game as the Warriors outscored the Cavaliers by 30 over the final 24 minutes. Despite the impressive finish, the Warriors couldn\u2019t help but look back at the way things were.  \u201dIt\u2019s not a rivalry, it\u2019s another game,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said wistfully. \u201dPart of me is a little nostalgic for that.\u201d Plagued by injuries in recent years and jobless after being waived by the Knicks in October, former All-Star Joakim Noah wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever play in the NBA again. That moment finally came with the Grizzlies in their 96-86 win over the Clippers, more than 11 months after his most recent outing in January. Noah scored only four points in 13 minutes, a far cry from his peak. But at this point, after seeing his career flash before his eyes, he\u2019s just glad to be back on the court in any capacity he can. \u201cI\u2019m really happy,\u201d an emotional Noah said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything anymore. I\u2019ve been in this league for a while now. Sometimes you take it for granted because there are so many games. Then you (can\u2019t play), it just feels good to be here in a locker room after a win, and feel that energy.\u201d \u201cHave you watched LeBron play before?\u201d \u2014 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, asked what makes James so difficult to guard.

How far do you see Denver going this season? What has you believing (or not believing) in them?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Here\u2019s how much I like the Nuggets \u2014 if LeBron James had wanted first and foremost to win another championship ring, and do so quickly, I think Denver would have been a better summer destination for him than the Lakers. Coach Michael Malone is working with a great ensemble, in need mostly of that tent-pole guy and reliable closer. As is, I think the Nuggets can go as far as the Western Conference finals, particularly if they get marvelously skilled big man Nikola Jokic to consistently play more aggressively on offense. Shaun Powell :  You must believe in Denver because as good as this team has looked lately, they\u2019ve yet to reach the ceiling. What happens when Will Barton returns? Are you a believer in Isaiah Thomas, who\u2019s also mending? Assuming these additions will only deepen and bolster the lineup, there\u2019s no reason not to believe the Nuggets will be a top-three team when the playoffs approach. Their deep lineup, solid defense most nights and freakish center in Nikola Jokic spells trouble for others. John Schuhmann :  It\u2019s fair to believe that the Nuggets are the early favorite to be the team that loses to the Warriors in the Western Conference finals. They\u2019re the only West team that ranks in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, having seen the league\u2019s biggest improvement on defense ( 6.4 fewer points allowed per 100 possessions than last season ). There\u2019s reason to be a little leery of that, because their new system (like that of the Bucks under Jason Kidd) can give up layups and corner 3-pointers, and much of their success is about their opponent 3-point percentage ( lowest in the league ), a number which can be a little deceiving at this point in the season. But the players have bought in and they\u2019ve played more games against top-10 offenses (nine) than they have against bottom-10 offenses (seven). Their bench has been very good (Trey Lyles can play), and should be better upon the return of Will Barton.  Sekou Smith :  The Nuggets came into this season on my teams-on-the-rise list and they\u2019ve lived up to it so far. They\u2019ve got the talent and depth to be a top-four team in the Western Conference playoff chase. They are that good. And yes, it\u2019s easy to believe in a team when they are tied for the No. 1 spot in the West. But what we\u2019re talking about is projecting where this Nuggets team is headed over the course of the next four-plus months. I\u2019m not nervous at all about projecting the Nuggets as a part of that top-four mix. I am confident they won\u2019t see a repeat of last season, when they played for a playoff spot on the final night of the regular season ( and lost it to the Minnesota Timberwolves in overtime)."},{"id":37053,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-kobe-says-lakers-win-title-too-long","date":"2018-12-05","title":"Blogtable: Your thoughts on Kobe's talk about Lakers?","content":" * * * Kobe Bryant said the Lakers will be champions \u201cbefore you know it.\u201d Is he right about this and, if so, when do you think the Lakers will get title No. 17?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  If the Lakers hoist the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in June 2020, I will not be surprised. That\u2019s an awfully fast track, just 23 months after landing LeBron James, but James has ridden in this rodeo before. He has no time to lose, either, as far as maximizing his superpowers against the inevitability of Father Time. We all expect an extensive renovation of the L.A. roster this offseason, just as Golden State comes a bit back to the pack and Houston continues to slide sideways. There are some pesky foes to consider in Toronto, Boston and Philadelphia, but let\u2019s get LeBron back to The Finals and see what happens. Shaun Powell :  The Lakers will raise another banner if Kevin Durant packs up and drives down the Pacific Coast Highway next summer. Absent of that, Kobe might be thinking wishfully. The Warriors with KD means everyone else, including LeBron James, is playing for second place for the next 2-3 seasons. And LeBron, who turns 34 this month, is on the clock. John Schuhmann :  \u201cBefore you know it\u201d is a little too vague to determine if it\u2019s right or wrong. I guess it\u2019s correct if he\u2019s talking to people who watch The Finals on TV with a five-second delay. We can be 95 percent sure that the Lakers aren\u2019t winning a championship this season. Beyond that, who knows? It will depend a lot on what Kevin Durant chooses to do next summer. If he leaves Golden State (even it\u2019s not to join the Lakers), the championship picture opens up quite a bit.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019m not sure what Kobe means by \u201cbefore you know it.\u201d He left himself some very convenient wiggle room with that phrase. If the Lakers hit it big in free agency in the summer, he\u2019ll be a lot closer to right than he is at this moment. The Lakers are a long way from being ready to dethrone the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors. So it might be wise to pump the brakes a bit on all of this championship talk involving the Lakers. That said, it\u2019s been a while since the Lakers had this kind of hope to hang on to. LeBron James has a way of making that happen, wherever he goes. But there\u2019s no need to go ordering banner 17 until we see how free agency plays out."},{"id":37055,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-team-most-needs-shake-next","date":"2018-12-05","title":"Blogtable: Which team most needs a shake-up?","content":"* * * The Bulls fired coach Fred Hoiberg on Monday. What other team might be due for a shake-up? And what would that shake-up look like?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  New Orleans. By now, Washington\u2019s woes are old news. Houston and Utah falling farther short of expectations than any other teams to this point suggests shake-ups there, yet their issues might best be solved internally. The Pelicans, meanwhile, have swooned of late, are playing through significant defensive issues and, as always, are burdened by the Anthony Davis clock. The vultures will be circling as the summer of 2020 approaches \u2014 that\u2019s when the all-NBA big man can opt out of his contract \u2014 if New Orleans cannot generate real momentum toward championship contention. And with Jimmy Butler showing us how ugly things can get when a player still is a year away from free agency, New Orleans needs to tighten up defensively and seek outside help to demonstrate to Davis he can reach his goals right there. Shaun Powell :  Let\u2019s just say the Washington Wizards can\u2019t afford another month like November , for the sake of coach Scott Brooks \u2026 and a few rotational players \u2026 and, perhaps, GM Ernie Grunfeld. There\u2019s too much talent on this team and too little depth in the Eastern Conference for the Wizards to collect Ls at the rate they\u2019ve gotten them. Bradley Beal is always mentioned as trade bait, but I\u2019d ship John Wall and his contract on the first plane out of Reagan National Airport if there\u2019s a taker. A revamped Wizards team would keep losing and compete for a top pick in the 2019 draft. John Schuhmann :  Houston, Miami and Washington would be the usual suspects, though the Rockets\u2019 desperation is more about adding to what they have than shaking things up. But, after a third loss by more than 30 points in the last week , it\u2019s time to wonder how the Spurs transition into whatever\u2019s next. They\u2019ve never ranked worse than 11th defensively in the last 21 years (and have ranked in the top five in 17 of those 21), but they\u2019ve been the league\u2019s second worst defensive team this season . Their offense is built around two guys that take the most inefficient shots on the floor , they have one of the league\u2019s oldest rosters, and it\u2019s very likely that their 21-year playoff streak is coming to an end.  Sekou Smith :  I hate that his name has to be included in the ongoing coaching rumor mill, but Scott Brooks will see his name remain in that mix until the Washington Wizards rise above the playoff chase cutoff line in the Eastern Conference. The situation in Washington will have to be addressed if things continue the way have so far. And unfortunately for Brooks, and coaches in sticky situations anywhere else, the coach is usually the first one to go (ask Tyronn Lue or Hoiberg). These shake-ups usually mean an assistant already on staff is elevated to the top spot, more often than not on an interim basis.

Simply making the playoffs would be a step in the right direction for the Lakers, as they\u2019ve been out of the postseason for five years and counting.  Lakers legend Kobe Bryant knows that playoff trips alone are not in the team\u2019s future, though. With LeBron James at the controls for Los Angeles, Bryant said at the Lakers All-Access event at Staples Center last night that the team will be champions again soon.   When asked by Bill Macdonald \u2014 the team\u2019s play-by-play announcer and emcee for the event \u2014 if the Lakers will win another title, Bryant didn\u2019t hold back.   \u201cOf course they will. Of course they will,\u201d Bryant said, per Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times . \u201cThey have determination to figure it out. They will figure it out. They have talented pieces \u2026. So enjoy the journey because we\u2019ll be champions before you know it. Then we\u2019ll just be laughing at all the Warrior fans.\u201d   Bryant expressed confidence in not only James, but also in the team\u2019s young core of talent that includes Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and others. However, Bryant warned that LeBron cannot continue to bear a heavy load for the Lakers if that championship dream is to be realized in the coming years.  \u201cComing in here, this organization, this city, it\u2019s not anything that is new to him,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHe\u2019s always had the spotlight, right? He\u2019s been able to deal with that gracefully. I think the difference here is that you have a collection of players with a lot of talent all young. And so the challenge is, can they figure out what their games are individually, sooner rather than later?  \u201cBecause at the beginning of the season, you saw a collection of individual talent trying to figure out what they can do and where they can do it on the floor. What about their games? But at the same time how to figure out how to make those games blend in as a group. You can\u2019t have one before the other, see what I\u2019m saying? So it\u2019s a test of Bron\u2019s patience, and also doing what he needs to do to keep the team\u2019s head above water. So it\u2019s a balancing act.\u201d   The Lakers began the season 2-5 and were 23rd in Defensive Rating , 21st in Rebound Percentage and 25th in opponent points in the paint . Since then, they are third in Defensive Rating , 10th in rebound percentage and 15th in opponent points in the paint . The Lakers added veteran center Tyson Chandler on Nov. 6 after he was waived by the Phoenix Suns and his presence has helped stabilize the Lakers\u2019 interior defense.  But much of the credit for the Lakers\u2019 turnaround goes to James. He\u2019s averaging 27.8 points, 7.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists for the Lakers and has played in every game. In addition, James\u2019 usage percentage has jumped from 28.9 in October to 32.1 in November and is at 27.7 so far in December .  Bryant remains confident the Lakers\u2019 youngsters will turn things around and help James carry the team\u2019s load.  \u201cUnbelievable talents,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThe patience is on all of us. We have to be patient. But as players, you\u2019re never patient with yourself. You\u2019re patient with each other, but not with yourself. You want to be there now and you work to be there now with the understanding that it is going to take time. But you want to be there now. That\u2019s the way that you accelerate growth. They have a lot of potential, man. They\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d  Bryant was the featured speaker at the All-Access event, which also saw Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, coach Luke Walton and GM Rob Pelinka all speak as well.  The Lakers host the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) before playing on the road in eight of their next 11 games.

Chicago is averaging 103.4 points \u2013 28th in the NBA \u2013 and is getting outscored by 9.6 per game. Hoiberg, who had to deal with a veteran roster that didn\u2019t fit his style early on and then injuries to key players starting in training camp, never found his footing in Chicago. It added up to a 115-155 mark with one playoff appearance in three-plus seasons \u2013 5-19 this year. The only teams with worse records were Cleveland and Phoenix. Even so, executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson insisted this decision went beyond wins and losses, citing a lack of \u201cenergy and spirit.\u201d \u201cWe were in a similar situation last year at this time,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cBut the entire energy about this group was different back then. We felt that here in the last several weeks, that something\u2019s different. What we\u2019re lacking \u2026 is a spirit about our team.\u201d * Aschburner:  Boylen ready for challenge in Chicago? Paxson also said the Bulls are committed to Boylen as their long-term head coach and that general manager Gar Forman is \u201cabsolutely safe.\u201d \u201cWe can own `Bulls\u2019 across our chest better,\u201d said Boylen, who will be serving as an NBA head coach for the first time. Hoiberg was in a tough position with four of the team\u2019s top players getting injured, a run that started early in training camp. Forward Lauri Markkanen, the centerpiece of their rebuilding plan, missed the first 23 games after spraining his left elbow at practice in late September. His first appearance this season \u2013 a loss at Houston \u2013 came in Hoiberg\u2019s final game for Chicago. Guard Denzel Valentine will miss the entire season because of a left ankle injury. Forward Bobby Portis (right knee) has played in four games and point guard Kris Dunn (left knee) has appeared in one, though both are expected back soon. \u201cFor us to sit here and think that just because we\u2019re getting guys back, I think that would mask the problems that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cWe gave Fred an opportunity. He did a lot of good things for us. But I\u2019m tasked with, Gar\u2019s tasked with, looking at the underlying things in the organization.\u201d Hoiberg played four seasons in Chicago and had a long history with Forman. He was hired as the Bulls\u2019 head coach in June 2015 after spending five seasons at Iowa State, where the former player was nicknamed \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d Hoiberg went 115-56 with the Cyclones, including four straight NCAA Tournament appearances and back-to-back Big 12 tournament titles. He replaced Tom Thibodeau, who was fired after five seasons, and the hope was that the free-wheeling style he used with the Cyclones would work in the NBA and that he would fare better than another former Iowa State coach, Tim Floyd, who went 49-190 record in three-plus seasons with the Bulls. The circumstances were different, but the results were just as disappointing. Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler, Pau Gasol and Nikola Mirotic were among the departures as the Bulls tried to find the right formula. Butler called out Hoiberg in his first year, saying the team needed to be \u201ccoached a lot harder.\u201d The Bulls then signed veterans Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo \u2013 odd fits for Hoiberg\u2019s offense \u2013 and got knocked out by Boston in the first round of the playoffs. The Bulls finally went all-in on rebuilding when they dealt Butler to Minnesota in a 2017 draft night trade. They got Markkanen, Dunn and Zach LaVine and appeared to be on the right track last season, with their competitiveness and player development. Boylen becomes the sixth coach hired by the current front office. He spent four years as the head coach at the University of Utah. Over 20 years in the NBA, he also has been an assistant in Houston, Golden State, Milwaukee, Indiana and San Antonio."},{"id":37116,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-12-3-18","date":"2018-12-04","title":"About Last Night: Joker To The Rescue","content":"Is it time to start talking about the Nuggets as serious title contenders? Denver entered Monday night tied with the Clippers for first in the West, riding a five-game winning streak, and boasting one of the best big men in the game in Nikola Jokic. But winning in Toronto, against the East\u2019s top team (and No. 1 in NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings ), is no easy feat. That task became even trickier once Gary Harris, Denver\u2019s top scorer, was forced from the game after the first quarter with a sore right hip. Enter The Joker. Jokic did a bit of everything, tallying his second triple-double this season with 23 points, 11 rebounds and 15 assists (more on those below) to lead Denver to a 106-103 win over Toronto , snapping the Raptors\u2019 eight-game winning streak. Jokic also knocked down three game-winning free throws in the final 7.0 seconds to ice the game and put a bow on the Nuggets\u2019 signature win this season. \u201cThis is a winning team,\u201d Jokic said afterward. \u201cThis is a hell of a team.

Tobias Harris, who was named Western Conference Player of the Month earlier in the day, led the Clippers with 27 points, but it was Lou Williams who clinched the win, hitting a clutch off-balance jumper with 6.4 seconds left.

Which, for what that means in the NBA, belongs on the late, great George Carlin\u2019s list of oxymorons somewhere between \u201cairline food\u201d and \u201csmall crowd.\u201d Boylen was promoted from associate head coach Monday, taking over a 5-19 team that is \u201cstill at the early stages of what we started\u201d last season. That\u2019s how John Paxson, the Bulls\u2019 vice president of basketball operations, put it after the team\u2019s first practice under Boylen, who became the 17th, uh, permanent coach in franchise history. What the Bulls started last season was officially billed as a \u201crebuild.\u201d But what it dragged with it was a culture of losing, a mission in which their position in the Draft lottery mattered more than their winning percentage. That one paid off with the selection at No. 7 of rookie Wendell Carter Jr. Still, the culture was back for the first seven weeks this time around, not just as leftover infestation but fueled by early-season injuries to three of the Bulls\u2019 top five or six players. Seven-foot shooter Lauri Markkanen (zero), Kris Dunn (one) and Bobby Portis (four) played in a total of five of Chicago\u2019s first 23 games. Markkanen, a first-team all-rookie honoree in 2018, made his debut at Houston on Saturday after suffering a seriously sprained right elbow in September. Dunn (left knee) and Portis (right knee) are practicing now and said to be a week or so away. (Role player Denzel Valentine had ankle surgery last week and is out for the season .) With three starters back to bolster Zach LaVine (25.0 ppg, 10th in the NBA) and Carter \u2014 and with other Bulls having gained reps and experience that could help them in more specific secondary roles \u2014 conventional wisdom said that at last, Hoiberg would be allowed to coach his preferred style with the proper personnel. And even, for once, be judged not by developing second-tier talent or keeping one eye on the ping-pong balls, but on the Bulls\u2019 wins and losses. So naturally, he gets fired now. Hoiball, we hardly knew ye. This story is all about the when, as it is such an unusual time to have terminated a coach. H ad Hoiberg been fired before last season, when the Bulls made the choice to lose games, that might have made NBA sense. Had he gotten axed after this season, after a real opportunity to coach their best players as he saw fit, that would have been fair. But this? It\u2019s like sending home Gladys Knight as the last Pip shows up for work. Hoiberg finally gets the group with which he could grow, the core that offered several legit glimpses of its talent last December, and he\u2019s pink-slipped before they can even run through one full practice. He leaves with a dreary 115-155 record and more than a season and a half left on his five-year, $25 million contract. He\u2019ll also tote with him the sad fact that, year after year, he was dealt losing basketball hands by Paxson, GM Gar Forman and the ever-shuffling Bulls. In 2015-16, Hoiberg was the front office\u2019s answer to newly fired Tom Thibodeau, inheriting an aching, aging roster that was largely played out. The following season was a chemistry experiment gone awry when Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade took over one side of the locker room while Rajon Rondo huddled with some overmatched youngsters on the other. Last season was one long \u201ctank you\u201d note, with injuries and the Portis-Nikola Mirotic training camp throwdown for drama. And now this, with LaVine dominating the ball, Jabari Parker drawing a $20 million salary to play offense only and a succession of point guards (Cam Payne, Ryan Arcidiacono, Shaquille Harrison) bringing NBA G League stylings to the big stage. Paxson kept repeating the words \u201cenergy,\u201d \u201ceffort,\u201d \u201cpassion\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d as the Bulls\u2019 current deficiencies. He said it had nothing to do with the W-L record and downplayed the idea that Hoiberg was on the brink of being dealt a playable hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as saying we\u2019d have gotten that [energy] with healthy players,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cWe need to find a spirit to our group that\u2019s been missing, and missing for quite some time. \u201cYou have to be able to get your identity across to your team. We just felt we\u2019re not playing the style with the force that we want our group to play with. You may not win games, but you can get many of your players to play that way. That\u2019s why we decided to do it now, with three of our more talented players coming back.\u201d Hoiberg was maybe too nice, a characterization that often seemed impossible to shake, but he stayed classy inside and out the organization to the end. \u201cRegardless of how you are as an individual,\u201d said Will Perdue, the former NBA big man turned Bulls analyst for NBC Sports Chicago, \u201cto be a successful NBA coach, you have to have a little bit of an ass in you. I don\u2019t think Fred has that in him.\u201d Yeah, well, he also didn\u2019t have enough talent on his roster (Cristiano Felicio, four years, $32 million?) or one true, enduring vision laid down by management. Now it is Boylen\u2019s turn, with an apparent mandate to chew on players and neither a chance nor an imperative to chase a playoff berth. Even if the Bulls were to go .500 the rest of the way, beginning Tuesday at Indiana ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ), they\u2019d finish 34-48. If Hoiberg was a poor man\u2019s attempt to replicate Steve Kerr as an NBA coach, Boylen\u2019s portfolio suggests a Thibodeau redux, albeit with a lower profile. Boylen\u2019s coaching career stretches back more than 30 years, with 20 as an assistant in Houston, Milwaukee, Golden State, Indiana and San Antonio. Boylen also worked at Michigan State in two separate stints and was coach at the University of Utah from 2007-11. He was working with the Rockets when they won NBA titles in 1994 and \u201995 and with the Spurs in their 2014 championship. He got his start in the NBA as Houston\u2019s video coordinator in 1987. The new coach got into the weeds a bit when trying to explain how, exactly, he\u2019ll dial up all those rah-rah intangibles. He was better identifying the basketball issues that face the Bulls. And he met head-on the inevitable question about loyalty vs. career-climbing when an assistant replaces his boss by stressing his friendship with Hoiberg and work habits in the job he just held. The Xs & Os Boylen spoke of in need of work now included defensive rebounding, transition defense and details within plays (cutting, screening, passing). He wants the Bulls to play more physically, too. \u201cWe have to do our technique better,\u201d Boylen said. \u201cWe have to care about it more. [\u2026] We can own \u201cBulls\u201d across our chest better.\u201d Here\u2019s where the \u201cwhen\u201d matters most: By making the move now, management gives Boylen a chance with the team at nearly its healthiest. Now he has 58 games to make a difference. Or not. Not sticking the \u201cinterim\u201d tag on him sends a message to the players that they can\u2019t risk easing through what\u2019s left of this season. But it also allows the Bulls brass to evaluate now and, if they choose, hire an outsider like Monty Williams, Adrian Griffin, Tyronn Lue or some other candidate later.  That coach undoubtedly would be termed \u201cpermanent\u201d too. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Not one. He\u2019s working on a streak of 2,522 straight games (regular season and playoffs only) called and counting. Tonight\u2019s Golden State Warriors-Hawks game ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) will make 2,523, the longest current streak in the NBA. Legendary Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn\u2019s all-time record stands at 3,338 consecutive games , which gives Holman some work to do catch an icon. But based on his track record and royal radio pedigree \u2014 he got his start working for American broadcasting giant Curt Gowdy and cut his radio chops as a teenager working for and alongside Johnny Most, the legendary raspy radio voice of the Boston Celtics \u2014 Holman might be up for the task. A Lawrence, Mass., native, Holman has become an Atlanta staple as the colorful play-by-play voice of the Hawks. He\u2019s in the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame and the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame. He recently spent some time reflecting on his life and career with NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith: * * * Sekou Smith: Anybody who has ever been in this business know what kind of grind it is and can be. How in the world, 34 years in and counting, do you wrap your head around a streak like this? Steve Holman: Well, first of all, and I know it sounds kind of cliche, but I love what I do. If I didn\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t know what I would do. You know, I go to work every day. My dad worked as a draftsman when I was a kid. And he hated his work. But he went everyday. So he taught me to go to work everyday. And I figured I\u2019ve got a job that I love to do, so it\u2019s easy for me to show up every day. SS: I know your roots are in Boston, so how did you end up in Atlanta? SH: Well, I worked for Curt Gowdy. He owned the radio station in my hometown. And from there I got a pass to the Celtics games. That was the first thing I did when I got the job at the radio station. And then I went and introduced myself to Johnny Most. I would go and sit with him and I kept score for him and got his English Oval cigarettes and filled his thermos with coffee every night. He lost his voice a couple of times and I had to take over for him. Then a guy in Boston from the CBS station heard me and he brought me there to the CBS station in Boston, WEEI, and then he came to Atlanta to start the all-news station, WGST , in 1980. And he called me and said, \u2018do you want to come to Atlanta?\u2019 That\u2019s how I got here. I did Falcons for five years and then in \u201885-86 I started doing the Hawks. SS: So how old were you when you got that first break into the business, you had to be a young kid? SH: Curt Gowdy hired me full time between my junior and senior year of high school. I was 17 and he told me it was $110 a week and all of the records I could steal. [Laughing] SS: After all of these years, have you looked back at where you started and where we are now and just been amazed by the technology and what\u2019s possible now? SH: Sure. It\u2019s gone from you slicing tape with a razor blade and you putting it together to \u2026 you know the funny thing is, people would say after all of these years and really just over the years, that radio play-by-play is going to die because of the TV and all this other stuff. But to me it\u2019s bigger now than it ever was because of the NBA GameTime App, where people all over the world can listen to us. You have Sirius\/XM and we\u2019re on their App, too. So, it\u2019s expanded so you\u2019re more than just a local broadcast anymore. Even though, I continue to broadcast to Hawks fans. That\u2019s my thing. I am broadcasting to our fans. And I know people are listening all over the \u2026 everywhere. And the one thing that\u2019s changed, I know a lot of bloggers and people tune in over the Internet, and it\u2019s sort of the \u2018got you\u2019 thing, for people trying to catch you making a mistake and that kind of thing. I try not to let that kind of thing bother me and I just go ahead and broadcast for Hawks fans. They call me a homer sometimes, and I guess that\u2019s true. [Laughing] SS: You\u2019re also a touchstone for the Hawks for generations of fans. Does that mean something to you, in terms of you grew up with someone as the voice of your favorite team, and now you\u2019re going to be that voice for generations of Hawks fans? SH: I thought about that when I first started. A lot of guys get into this business and they want to go on to the networks. And that\u2019s great when they do. It\u2019s terrific. But my idea was to try and be Johnny Most or Chick Hearn or Vin Scully, and be the guy that was person with that one team for life, you know. And now I have people in their 30s and they have their kids with them and they come up and want to take a picture with me and they say, \u2018I used to listen to Mr. Holman when I was your age.\u2019 And I take a picture with these kids and I love it. I think it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve even got players now that come along and tell me they listened to me when they were kids, like [former Hawks star] Josh Smith, when he came here I introduced myself to him and he said, \u2018I know who you are. My dad used to make me listen to you in the car all the time when I was a kid.\u2019 So it\u2019s kind of neat. I mean, it starts going in cycles. I called all of Dell Curry\u2019s games against the Hawks and now Steph Curry\u2019s playing against the Hawks, so it comes full circle in a lot of ways. I get those father-son combinations, you know, Tito Horford and Al Horford and guys like that, so it\u2019s kind of neat like that, too. SS: I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s been fascinating to see all of the different cycles in the league, from the Celtics teams you watched growing up to the Magic-Bird era, the Jordan years and all of his battles with Dominique Wilkins and all of the different iterations of the league since then. Has there been one era that sticks out more than the others for you? SH: I think the \u201880s was terrific, the classic Dominique-Larry Bird battle was great. Then you get into the \u201890s and Jordan battles were great. We ran into the \u201cBad Boys\u201d in Detroit and the Jordan Bulls and we had some really good teams then. But I think the NBA\u2019s in a place right now where I just love it. The fast pace, the 3-point shot and the high scores on the board. All of these kids we have in the league right now, like Trae Young, our guy, he\u2019s phenomenal. I love watching them all and watching the kids grow. We\u2019re going through some growing pains right now around here but I know ultimately what\u2019s going to come out of it. I just have always tried, in all these years, 34 seasons now, never to be the \u2018get off my lawn!\u2019 guy. So I like to roll with it. And the young guys keep me young. I like to try to keep up with them if I can. I\u2019ll throw out something on an elevator that they might be surprised to hear me say [laughing]. Maybe quote something from 2 Chainz and they get to be my pals. SS: I know you say the game itself and the games have energized you over the years. But has the schedule and pace of the season ever been just a physical grind on you, doing this same thing for all of these years? SH: Well, when I first started, we traveled commercial, which was tough. Back-to-backs were really hard. We\u2019d get 4:30 wake-up calls and 5 a.m. busses to the airport. So, the travel has really gotten so much better now with the charter flights. It\u2019s still a grind, when you are doing back-to-backs and you get in at two or three in the morning, but that\u2019s why I try to keep fit. I want to keep doing it for as long as I possibly can. Thank goodness the Hawks have been great to me and allowed me to do this as long as they have. Hopeful they let me do it for many more years to come, because it keeps me going. It\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s part of my life right now, really, after 34 years. SS: I know so many announcers have honed their craft and developed a certain voice and signature calls. There always seem to be something people know you by. What are those things that people come up to you on the street and ask you to say for them? SH: Well, you know, I have a few. The \u201cBang\u201d [ when Hawks players knock down a 3-pointer ] is one that I carried that over from Johnny Most as sort of a tribute to him. And people come up to me think I stole that from Mike Breen. And I say, no. Ask Mike Breen where he got it. He used to do the morning sports on the [Don] Imus Show and he told me would play my highlights and hear me say that and that\u2019s where it came from. I have a few other things I use, \u2018tricky dribble\u2019 and \u2018around the perimeter,\u2019 which is a nod to the highway [Interstate 285] for the people from Atlanta who know this city. Then there is another one people always ask me about that\u2019s become an infamous call. When Dennis Schroder was with us and we were playing in Sacramento and it\u2019s 1 a.m. back in Atlanta and people heard me say, \u2018For the love of God, Dennis just shot an airball.\u2019 And more people come up to me now about that than they do anything. They\u2019ll want me to say that. I was at Stone Mountain the other day with my grandson and a couple of the kids that were there recognized me and they said, \u2018can you say it. Go ahead and say it, say it.\u2019 So I said it and the one kid said to the other one, \u2018I told you that was him.\u2019 [Laughing] So it\u2019s really fun, I love it when they do that. SS: You\u2019ve been around this franchise and seen some pretty colorful characters and some really interesting teams, some good and some bad. Who have been the personalities that have really stuck out to you over the years? SH: Well, you know my first group was the Doc [Rivers], Dominique, Randy Wittman, Cliff Levingtston, Antoine Carr, Tree Rollins and those guys. So I have a soft spot in my heart for them because of that. But every different era has produced guys I\u2019ll never forget. Smitty [NBA TV analyst Steve Smith], who you work with all the time, is one of my all-time favorites. Even J.R. Rider, in his own way, was kind of a trip, too. Just to go through all of that was something. [Former coach] Lenny Wilkins, trying to figure out how to deal with him, there have been so many. And these young guys we have now, I really love them. Our coach now, Lloyd Pierce, is a young guy, just 42, and I think the perfect guy for our team. It\u2019s been a great ride. There aren\u2019t any players we\u2019ve had that I can say I didn\u2019t like. You get to know them on a completely different level traveling and being around them the way we do. It\u2019s been terrific just to be around them all the time. SS: Do you find yourself being mindful of trying to humanize these guys in your broadcasts? I know we all see them from a distance and see them perform, but we don\u2019t get the behind-the-scenes view of them the way you do. It\u2019s always seemed to me that you get a different depth of understanding of these guys from the radio more than you do any other outlet. SH: That\u2019s what I do when I broadcast a game, I try to do it like I\u2019m sitting face-to-face with someone watching the game. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And when we were in Oklahoma City I talked to Trae about his family and all the tickets he had to get. There are all of these storylines and everything else we have a chance to touch on during the game because it\u2019s me on my own during that game. So I\u2019m weaving a story. I like to throw in things about what happened on the bus on the way into the arena and things like that so they can feel like they are a part of it. Not everybody gets to talk to the players and coaches every day, so I like to be the bridge between the two and be like the fan broadcasting the game, is I think the best way I can put it. SS: I know how meticulous you are about your game preparation, with those detailed handwritten lineup cards filled with notes that you have for every game. I know your streak is up to a mind-boggling number. But if you have 24 hours a day, 365 days in a year, would you even dare to put a number on the hours you spends immersed in this thing? SH: I\u2019ve picked up some shortcuts now and then over the years. But I still keep my scorecard handwritten by pen. I make it out every day the same way. I use the computer and I have the courtside program from the NBA. I do use the computers. I\u2019m no dinosaur. But I still like to write out the scorecard, the same one I made for Johnny Most back when I was 18 years old. And I use that every night and keep my own scorecard just to keep me in the game better. So that\u2019s one of my throwback things I do. It\u2019s a part of the preparation, takes a couple of hours every day to get that ready and look over the notes and do the stats and everything. Over the years you learn how to use your time wisely and then you get out there every night, and it\u2019s like the old saying around riding back, and the ball goes up and there you go. SS: I know any time there is a long streak, don\u2019t you have to ignore it at the stage so you \u2026 SH: Yeah, I know, you don\u2019t want to jinx it, that\u2019s for sure. But there have a been a couple of times it\u2019s been close. You know Steve Jr. passed in January, and that was a really tough time for me and my entire family and \u2026 and really, one of the things that got me through that was doing the games. We had his funeral and I did a game that night \u2026 [choking up] and that was No. 1, because I know he would have wanted it that way because he was big on the streak and on the Hawks, of course. He loves the Hawks since he was a little kid, he was a ball boy from 11 until he graduated high school and he was always at the arena. And the Hawks were terrific. They put on the reception at the arena. I\u2019ll always be grateful to Steve Koonin, Andrew Saltzman and Tony Ressler. That was like family to me and it helped me get through everything during that time. And that\u2019s why I said, right now, that\u2019s what keeps me going is doing these games. That connection. It\u2019s a part of me and what I do. SS: It\u2019s an awesome number and a pretty crazy feat to be at 2,522 straight games and counting. You literally haven\u2019t missed a day of work in 34 years and have been doing this longer than I\u2019m sure plenty of your listeners have been alive. SH: Like I always say, I credit the good doctors who help me when I get sick. And I take the steroid shot or whatever and I work out now every day for the past eight, nine 10 years or so. I feel better now than I did 20 years ago. And I also have to give some credit to good bourbon I guess, too. [Laughing] But it\u2019s been a great ride, better than anything I ever dreamed it would be. I\u2019ve been blessed to be in this position all these years. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

That\u2019s exactly what we all got on Thursday as Kevin Durant ran wild (51 points, 11 rebounds, six assists) for short-handed Golden State but was ultimately outdone by Kawhi Leonard (37 points, eight rebounds) and a balanced Raptors crew. Grizzlies 131, Nets 125 (2 OT) \u2014 Late in a close road game, a veteran-laden team like Memphis would turn to stalwarts Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Instead, it was rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. who came through in regulation, nailing two clutch shots en route to a 36-point night that helped spark a thrilling comeback win in Brooklyn for the Grizzlies. Wizards 135, Rockets 131 (OT) \u2014 James Harden showed exactly why he is the reigning Kia MVP, torching the Wizards for 54 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists. His teammate, Eric Gordon, dropped in 36 points and, combined with Harden, that would seem enough for a win. Too bad it wasn\u2019t for Houston, as John Wall (36 points, 11 assists) and Bradley Beal (32 points) led Washington to a thrilling (and much-needed) victory. Warriors 116, Magic 110 \u2014 Orlando has surprised many this season and logged big wins on the road over San Antonio, the Los Angeles Lakers and others. They probably could have added the Warriors to that list, too, were it not for Kevin Durant. The Warriors\u2019 star forward went for 49 points, netting a key three-point play with 1:19 left and a 3-pointer with 22 seconds remaining to seal Golden State\u2019s win. Nuggets 113, Blazers 112 \u2014 Denver enjoyed a home-heavy schedule in November, but ended the month with a thrilling victory in Portland to start a road-heavy December and January. Gary Harris came through with a clutch 3-pointer late in the game as the Nuggets continue to stay in the playoff mix in the Western Conference. Celtics 118, Wolves 109 \u2014 Gordon Hayward has had his struggles getting his game back to the All-Star level it was at before his horrific leg injury last season. However, on Saturday in Minnesota, Hayward looked like the Hayward of old in dropping 30 points, nine rebounds and eight assists on the Wolves to fuel the Celtics\u2019 win. James Harden (54 points, 17-32 FG, 7-15 3pt FG, 13-15 FT, 8 reb, 13 ast, 3 stl in 47 minutes) \u2014 His shot chart read like a how-to for the modern NBA game as only three of his shot attempts came from the mid-range (he was 2-for-3 on those). Overall, Harden put on a scoring show that few in the NBA can match. Too bad his efforts weren\u2019t enough to get Houston a win Monday. | Watch  | Video box score Russell Westbrook (23 points, 10-17 FG, 18 reb, 15 ast, 2 stl in 37 minutes) \u2014 That Westbrook ran wild against the struggling Cavs wasn\u2019t the reason to highlight this game. That he tied Jason Kidd for No. 3 on the NBA\u2019s all-time triple-doubles list \u2026 that is what got our attention. Not only did he pull that off, but Westbrook got career triple-double No. 107 in his 760th career game (it took Kidd to his 1,247th game). | Watch | Video box score Kevin Durant (51 points, 18-31 FG, 4-7 3pt FG, 11 reb, 6 ast in 42 minutes) \u2014 No Stephen Curry (again). No Draymond Green (again). No problem (again) for Durant in shouldering the Warriors\u2019 burden. Although his scoring exploits didn\u2019t lead to a win (as they did on Monday against the Magic), he put on a show and gave us all reason to hope for at least four more of these matchups come June 2019. | Watch | Video box score Gordon Hayward (30 points, 8-16 FG, 4-5 3pt FG, 9 reb, 8 ast, 2 stl in 29 minutes) \u2014 When Boston inked Hayward via free agency two summers ago, this is the kind of production they were hoping for. Even Wolves fans (and some still-bitter Jazz fans) had to admit it was great to see the former All-Star show flashes of his old self with his playmaking, 3-point shooting and rainbow fadeaway jumpers. | Watch | Video box score Anthony Davis (36 points, 14-19 FG, 2-3 3pt FG, 19 reb, 8 ast, 2 stl, 2 blk in 37 minutes) \u2014 Few players can be as efficient and devastating as Davis can. He showed everything that makes him perhaps the NBA\u2019s best all-around big man with 3-pointers, rim protection and a must-rewatch drive and dunk on Frank Kaminsky. | Watch | Video box score \u201cYou\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re against us. LeBron is arguably the best player ever. When he comes to town, the Lakers and their fans carry. As long as their fans go home disappointed, that\u2019s all I care about.

But take that L on the way out.\u201d \u2014 Nuggets coach Michael Malone \u201cWhat we need to do is win enough games to get the respect of our fans so they will come out and watch us play anyone, even on a Monday or Tuesday. That\u2019s when you need to have a hot gym.\u201d \u2014 Pistons coach Dwane Casey \u201cJust to be named with Jason Kidd and Magic and Oscar and those guys, I could have never dreamt about being able to even sit here talking to you guys. I take everything in and never take anything for granted.\u201d \u2014 Thunder guard Russell Westbrook , on tying Jason Kidd for third on the NBA\u2019s all-time triple-doubles list \u201cHe said if we\u2019re gonna be a playoff team it\u2019s time to show everybody. For him to open his mouth like that it shocked a lot of people. That was big and it got us over the hump. He\u2019s our vet. He\u2019s our leader.\u201d \u2014 Nuggets guard Gary Harris , on Paul Millsap\u2019s late-game pep talk Friday vs. Portland \u201cIn winning time, to take those shots, it takes a unique heart, skill, ability and just cold-blooded nature. Jaren has that.\u201d \u2014 Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff , on rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s slowly coming along. I think my confidence is slowly coming back too. I\u2019m still not where I want to be, but for sure me attacking is better for our team and not being hesitant or passive.\u201d \u2014 Celtics forward Gordon Hayward \u201cI just want it to be consistent, at one point. Every night is the same [expletive]. Every night has been the same [expletive]. If you call something one way, you have to call it the other way. Once they start doing that, I\u2019m going to have a little more respect. I\u2019m just tired of it. Every game is the same.\u201d \u2014 Jazz center Rudy Gobert , on officiating late in Utah\u2019s loss to the Heat Big men only  Some mountain climbing  Man, that\u2019s cold!

Booker, who missed Friday\u2019s loss to the Magic with a toe injury, was sprinting back on defense with just over two minutes left in the second quarter and grabbed at his left hamstring as he ran out of bounds. Booker immediately went to the Suns\u2019 locker room and didn\u2019t return for the start of the second half. He finished with six points and did not play the rest of the game, which the Suns lost 120-96. Booker missed three games in October after straining his left hamstring in the Suns\u2019 first game against the Lakers.

The good news: The playoffs don\u2019t start for more than four months. The better news: The Spurs, who haven\u2019t missed the postseason since 1996-97, are still only 4 1\/2 games out of first place. Not that many expect them to seriously threaten for that spot, even with the Warriors plagued by injuries and inconsistency and preseason favorites like the Rockets and the Jazz also floundering. But after losing their previous two games by a combined 70 points, the Spurs were just happy to celebrate a win. DeMar DeRozan scored a season-high 36 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 29 for the Spurs, who blew an early 16-point lead, fell behind in the third quarter and ultimately beat the Blazers going away despite a 37-point onslaught from Damian Lillard. \u201cWe just told the guys, go out there and play relaxed,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much and have fun with it. We had a few minutes in the third quarter where we got away from that, but we pulled it back quick. As long as we play with confidence, everything will take care of itself.\u201d Captain Late  Jimmy Butler continued to impress with his clutch heroics, scoring 13 of his 21 points over the final 8:54 as the Sixers held off the Grizzlies 103-95 for their eighth win in nine games. That bumped his fourth-quarter scoring average up to 8.1 points per game , trailing only LeBron James (8.5) and Kemba Walker (8.2). Despite failing to maintain his triple-double pace in the second half, Pelicans center Anthony Davis was an absolute monster against the Hornets with 36 points, 19 rebounds and eight assists. According to the Pelicans, Davis is only the 14th player in NBA history to amass those numbers, and just the third since 1997. (For good measure, he also added two steals and two blocks.) He racked up plenty of highlight plays along the way, but none better than this sick crossover and slam over poor Frank Kaminsky. (Remember, Davis is a 6-foot-10 center.) You know you\u2019ve made a great fake when even the camera man can\u2019t keep up. Clippers guard\/irritant Patrick Beverley is notorious for a playing style that could be generously described as aggressive. Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr. became the latest to pay the price for that no-holds barred attitude, losing a tooth as he and Beverley battled for a loose ball in the second half. It didn\u2019t appear as if Beverley purposely struck Smith, and he reportedly tried to apologize to the Mavs\u2019 bench as Smith received treatment in the locker room. But Beverley being Beverley, the olive branch quickly withered as the Mavericks were less than interested in his concession, he responded in kind, and was soon ejected after bouncing the ball at a Mavs fan in the front row. (For his part, Beverley later accused the fan of using a pretty ugly epithet involving his mother.) https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRenderNBA\/status\/1069411913157746688 Smith had the last word, returning \u2014 with tooth reportedly intact, no less \u2014 to block Tobias Harris in the final seconds as the Mavs clung to a two-point lead, and then hitting a pair of free throws to seal a 114-110 victory. The Suns were pretty much doomed at Staples Center once Devin Booker was forced to leave the game with a hamstring injury. That makes the Lakers\u2019 turnaround only slightly less impressive. From down 17 midway through the first quarter to up 33 late in the fourth, they outscored the Suns by a whopping 50 points en route to a 120-96 win . Jazz center Rudy Gobert can expect to sacrifice some bread after his heated reaction to a shooting foul (as reported by Andy Larsen) that allowed Heat legend Dwyane Wade to hit the winning free throws with 3.2 seconds left at AmericanAirlines Arena. \u201cEvery night is the same (expletive),\u201d said Gobert, who was called for the foul while attempting to block Wade\u2019s layup attempt. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of it. We\u2019re a small market and we know it. It\u2019s not even personal; they\u2019re just doing their job. We all make mistakes. \u201c(But) they can\u2019t be deciding \u2026 a game just like that. If you call a foul on D-Wade, Donovan (Mitchell) got pushed harder right before. And he\u2019s not Dwyane Wade, it\u2019s fine. But just respect us, as competitors. I sacrifice everything to do this job, and I would like to be respected as a basketball player.\u201d As for teammate Ricky Rubio? He clearly has no intention of parting with his money. Despite the controversial finish, Wade and Mitchell swapped jerseys in an affectionate postgame moment. \u201cYou can\u2019t really think about it in the game but to look back at it, you\u2019re playing against your idol essentially,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI hit him up (before the game) to make sure I could snag it from him. He\u2019s an all-time great. To be able to play against him in that setting is special.\u201d  Somebody watched a LOT of Nickelodeon growing up\u2026"},{"id":37109,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/usa-qualifies-fiba-world-cup","date":"2018-12-03","title":"USA qualifies for FIBA World Cup","content":"Montevideo, Uruguay (AP) \u2014 Jeff Van Gundy did his job. USA Basketball is headed to the World Cup. The U.S. rallied late to beat Uruguay 78-70 on Sunday night to wrap up a spot next year in the FIBA World Cup in China. The U.S. won the last two World Cups in 2010 and 2014, and will aim to become the first nation to capture three consecutive gold medals. Travis Trice scored 17 points in the clinching win for the U.S., which used rosters filled primarily by G League players in qualifying. John Jenkins added 13 points for the Americans (8-2), who have two qualifying games remaining at North Carolina in February. \u201cNo better feeling than representing your country and getting a big road win to qualify for the World Cup!\u201d Jenkins tweeted after the game. \u201cThank you @usabasketball for this amazing experience and first class treatment. It was truly an honor!\u201d Gregg Popovich will coach the Americans at the World Cup in China, which also serves as an Olympic qualifier, and he raved about the job Van Gundy did as the U.S. coach in the qualifiers. \u201cCoach Van Gundy has been brilliant and he\u2019s working for pennies, zero pennies,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe wants to do it for the country and he loves coaching. There\u2019s nobody better to put a team together quickly.\u201d The U.S. needed a late 12-0 run to finally seize control, and that was enough to clinch the World Cup berth. \u201cHell of a job to get us qualified,\u201d Van Gundy told the Americans in the winning locker room. \u201cWell done.\u201d Uruguay led 61-54 in the fourth, and was still up 65-60 when the game changed. Jenkins\u2019 3-pointer with just under 2 minutes left put the Americans up by four, and Chasson Randle connected on another 3 on the next U.S. possession to cap the burst and give the U.S. a 72-65 edge. Scotty Hopson scored 11 points for the U.S., which has used 46 players in the 10 qualifying games played so far \u2014 all of them coached by Van Gundy, who was asked by USA Basketball to take G League players and get the country into the World Cup. Bruno Fitipaldo led Uruguay with 17 points. For the qualifiers, the U.S. used its junior varsity. Next summer, China will get to see the U.S. varsity. Van Gundy has used that analogy several times over the past 16 months, and it\u2019s fitting \u2014 the Americans qualified for the World Cup by using players that were plucked mostly from the G League. FIBA completely overhauled the qualifying system for this event, and most of the qualifying games were played at points in the year where players from the NBA or the top European leagues would not be available. At the World Cup, the U.S. is going send the best of the best. Or at least, some of the best of the best. LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul are all among the 35 players in USA Basketball\u2019s pool for the World Cup and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, though it\u2019ll likely be months before the Americans know exactly what group they\u2019ll be taking to China to play for Popovich. \u201cJeff has done an amazing job under really difficult circumstances,\u201d said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, who will assist Popovich next summer. \u201cTo have to qualify during the NBA season is a strange format but Jeff is the right guy for the job and he\u2019s proven that. \u2026 It\u2019s remarkable, to go ahead and do that without our top-flight players.\u201d The World Cup starts Aug. 31. The draw for the 32-team event will be held March 16. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a relief,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to get it done.\u201d"},{"id":37114,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/suns-futility-wears-devin-booker","date":"2018-12-03","title":"Futility in Phoenix wears on Devin Booker","content":" He is already a star at age 22 but on this particular play, Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker had role player instincts Sunday at Staples Center. The basketball bounced toward the baseline, beyond his reach, and he hustled anyway. And so the predictable happened: The ball beat him off the court and into the first row. Then the unthinkable happened: He grabbed his left leg and bent over in pain. The first player who rushed over to him yelled: \u201cBook! Book! Hamstring?\u201d ]It was thoughtful of LeBron James to check on Booker, even better if LeBron did this last summer as a free agent when Booker really could\u2019ve use a hand. Instead, Booker is not only limping right now \u2014 hopefully just temporarily for the team\u2019s sake \u2014 but also losing, something he has done more prolifically in Phoenix than get buckets. One of the shames of the NBA is how one of its breakout stars and franchise players is stuck on a habitually bad team, with no playoff shine in sight, and mostly invisible. Yes, only LeBron and Kevin Durant have reached 4,000 career points faster than Booker, but neither ever took Ls like this. Booker is now up to 136 in slightly over three seasons and once again the Suns, now 4-19, are on pace to be forgotten by Christmas. You could hardly blame their fans for getting their basketball fix these days by watching Duke games. All roads lead to the lottery, as it has since 2015 when Booker became one of the few draft decisions that actually worked out. But for Booker and the Suns, that\u2019s some tough medicine, playing another 55 games, swallow many depressing nights along the way, and then pray the odds work in their favor come June. It\u2019s fair to wonder how much of a toll this culture takes on Booker, who\u2019s once again a player who demands a double team, averaging nearly 25 points a game and doing decently as a stand-in at point guard. Some perspective is needed, though. Booker signed a five-year, $158 million contract extension in July, giving plenty of living and den space for all the losing he takes home at night. Still, he said, \u201c It sucks.\u201d Booker lost 58 games as a rookie, then 58 again, then 61 last year and may reach 65 or more this season. He\u2019s lost 13 straight games twice, and the Suns once lost 28 of 30 with Booker on the floor. In an 82-game season, it shouldn\u2019t be terribly difficult to put together, say, a four-game win streak. Booker is still waiting on that.  For years the situation just wasn\u2019t pretty in Phoenix and it\u2019s only slightly less ugly now. Too many poor Draft picks have delayed progress and ruined the team. Former lottery picks Dragan Bender, Marquese Criss and Alex Len couldn\u2019t earn rookie extensions and there was Phoenix\u2019s infamous point guard fetish of recent years when they went through Isaiah Thomas, Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight for little or nothing in return when they left. Sprinkle in some weird free-agent decisions \u2014 like signing Tyson Chandler only to buy him out three years later \u2014 and hilariously chasing LaMarcus Aldridge and it smacked of a team lacking both direction and a plan. Most of these moves were made by former GM Ryan McDonough and while James Jones represents a refreshing front-office change, he comes with little experience in that role. When you examine the fast-track of Booker, you get the best young scorer the league has seen since Durant and LeBron. You also get these numbers: Two, four and 47. That\u2019s how many general managers, coaches and teammates Booker has had in less than four NBA seasons, heavy turnover storming all around him. \u201cMy whole career except for the NBA, I\u2019ve been a winner,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI want to get back to that. I\u2019m done with not making the playoffs.\u201d Well, the circumstances say otherwise.  The Suns are essentially holding tryouts for the future now, though. Chandler was the first one thrown overboard and if Phoenix could get anything for Ryan Anderson and his contract, he\u2019d be next. For some reason Phoenix gave a head-scratching $15 million this season last summer to aging swingman Trevor Ariza. He\u2019s shooting 37.2 percent and scoring 9.9 ppg, taking minutes from young players. Among rotation players, the lone holdovers from 2017-18 are Booker, TJ Warren and Josh Jackson. Taking some advice he received from Chandler, who became a mentor, Booker believes it\u2019s necessary for him to adopt a more forceful role on the court and in the locker room even if, from an age perspective, he needs more seasoning for that. But what are the alternatives, given the ever-changing lineup? \u201cI\u2019m doing more leading by example and being more vocal about it, holding people accountable and hold myself accountable too,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a chore trying to pick up others when, after taking yearly poundings, you need a hand yourself. This is the mountain Booker is up against. Again. \u201cI know losing is tough on him because last year as a rookie I struggled with it,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m just keeping my head on straight now. We show flashes but we need consistency.\u201d Or you could say they need LeBron. And if Booker misses any extended time with a hamstring that has given him trouble before Sunday, well, as Jackson said: \u201cEverybody knows we need him desperately. The sooner we get him back, the better.\u201d With the possible exception of the Knicks, no franchise has splattered the concrete with the speed and consistency as the Suns. Before Booker was born, the Suns were a destination franchise, a place most players wanted to sign with, get drafted by and be traded to. The balmy winter weather was an obvious attraction but in the mid-1990s with Charles Barkley, and then 10 years later with Steve Nash, the Suns were also entertaining and won everything except a championship. Sellouts were common, the arena was a tough place for visitors and fans frolicked along with the Gorilla mascot. All this happened on Jerry Colangelo\u2019s watch and prosperity under owner Robert Sarver is on hourglass time. At least Booker is locked up for four more years and there\u2019s no danger of losing him, at least to another team, in the immediate future. They could lose him to frustration, though, fairly soon, especially when he sees other teams playing meaningful games and listens to other players during USA Basketball gatherings talk about what he\u2019s missing. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I have to do,\u201d Booker said, when asked about recruiting help in the near future. \u201cI think Phoenix is a place where people can see the potential, see our young nucleus.\u201d Unless there\u2019s a reversal of fortune in the near future, Phoenix could remain a basketball wasteland and no player, not even Booker, wants to wallow in that. Problem is, until there\u2019s a positive roster shakeup, the Suns lack enough to convince another superstar to sign up next summer or maybe even by 2020. At least when their lone star falls to the floor, as he did Sunday against the Lakers, Booker carries enough clout and respect to get a hand of a different sort from LeBron James. For now, that must do. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Curry showed some rust, missing seven of his first 10 shots, before heating up in the second half. He finished with 27 points in 37 minutes on 10-of-21 shooting. The Warriors, now riding a six-game road losing streak after the 111-102 loss in Detroit, keep losing the battle underneath. The Pistons had six more points in the paint and 12 more second-chance points. Steve Kerr blamed himself for the defeat, which saw the Pistons finish with 12 3-pointers and 14 offensive rebounds to Golden State\u2019s six and eight, respectively. Questions have surrounded Gordon Hayward ever since he suffered a gruesome ankle injury last October. On Saturday night, Hayward showed everyone he can still play an elite level, collecting 30 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in the Celtics\u2019 118-109 victory over the Timberwolves. Playing more aggressively than we\u2019ve seen all season, Hayward scored 11 of Boston\u2019s final 15 points over the last 3 1\/2 minutes of the game and made four of five shots from 3-point range. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be a mindset of mine, looking to get to the rim a little more,\u201d said Hayward. \u201cI was rewarded for that a little bit tonight with some free throws.\u201d Can we call this the night Hayward finally returned to his pre-injury All-Star form?

LeBron James (33), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: ATHO Latest stats: 7 games, 29.0 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 5.7 apg Season stats: 28.1 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 6.7 apg The King remains in a group by himself, and the last seven games haven\u2019t changed anything, especially when it includes a 51-point showing. We did notice a big statistical difference in wins compared to losses. In four wins, James averaged 35.8 points, 10.3 rebounds and 55.8 FG%. In three losses: 20.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 43.8 FG%. _______________________________________________________________ 1.

He also managed some nice synergy along the way with 27 points in each of the last three games. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019s gone for 17 or more in eight straight. More? He\u2019s hit three or more 3-pointers in two straight games. 2.

In three wins, Aldridge went for 25.7 points, 13.3 rebounds and 60.4 FG%. In four losses, he went for 12.8 points, 8.3 rebounds and 35.2 FG%.

Look at his numbers from the last seven games. Now look at his season stats. It doesn\u2019t get much more even than that. Redick has also gone for 15 or more in three straight and nine of the last 11 while connecting on four or more 3-pointers in four of the last eight. 4.

The gritty point guard has been nursing a nagging hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for the last three games. So why not a bigger drop? Because Paul delivered in his two games, going for 20 in each while handing out seven or more dimes in both. 5.

Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 8 games, 14.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 9.5 apg Season stats: 15.4 ppg, 4.5 apg, 10.3 apg Since his run of eight double-doubles in nine games in late October-early November, Lowry has been hit-and-miss. Over his last eight games, he\u2019s had just three double-doubles, and none of those in consecutive games. In fact, Lowry hasn\u2019t had back-to-back double-doubles since Nov. 4 and 5. 7. J.J. Barea (34), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 4 games, 16.0 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 7.5 apg Season stats: 11.0 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 6.2 apg The bad boy Pistons of the 1980s had Vinny \u2018The Microwave\u2019 Johnson. This year\u2019s Mavericks have Jose Juan (J.J.) Barea. The connection? Both are instant offense. In addition to scoring in double figures in eight straight, Barea is averaging 11 points in just 19.8 minutes. That works out to 26.7 points per 48 minutes. \u2018Nuff said. 8. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 7 games, 12.7 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 2.9 apg Season stats: 13.4 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 2.2 apg Gay started strong, securing three straight games of 17 or more points. But then things slowly headed downhill, scoring 11, 10, 8 and 3 over the last four. We realize he played less than 20 minutes in each of those last two games (Popovich wanted to take it easy on him before a grueling stretch), which is why he made the cut. 9. Wes Matthews (32), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: 7 Latest stats: 2 games, 13.0 ppg, 1.0 rpg, 1.0 apg Season stats: 15.8 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.2 apg Like Paul, Matthews managed just two games while dealing with a hamstring injury. Upon his return, Matthews scored 15 and 11, respectively \u2014 just enough to remain in the chase. Before dealing with the nagging hamstring injury, Matthews was producing to the tune of six games of 20 or more points over an eight-game span. 10. Dwyane Wade (36), Miami Heat Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 4 games, 17.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.3 apg Season stats: 15.2 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg Yep, Flash still has something left in the tank, lighting up the Raptors last Sunday for 35 points on 13-for-22 shooting to go along with six assists and five rebounds. Of course he did a lot better on the road than at home, going for 22.5 points on 56.3 FG% on two road games compared to 11.5 points and 42.1 FG% in two home games.

This is not to say Jaren Jackson Jr. came out of nowhere on Friday night. The fourth overall pick has been better than expected as a key cog in Memphis\u2019 grit and grind machine. But what Jackson did against the Nets was (or should be) a wake-up call. A Spencer Dinwiddie bucket had put Brooklyn up 111-104 with just 33 seconds remaining. Then Jackson tapped into his inner Larry Johnson and bagged a 4-point play. A Nets turnover gave the ball right back to Memphis. The Nets defended Memphis\u2019 initial options well, utlimately leaving Marc Gasol on an island. Gasol didn\u2019t hesitate to swing the ball to Jackson, because why wouldn\u2019t you trust a 19-year-old big man with the ball beyond the 3-point arc in crunch time? The rushed shot hit bottom and sent the game to overtime, where Memphis clawed back for a 131-125 overtime win on the road. Jackson Jr. finished with 36 points and eight rebounds. The Grizzlies are now 13-8, in the thick of the Western Conference\u2019s upper crust. Jackson Jr. is a big reason why. His versatility (2.1 blocks per game and 34.9 percent from 3) has been at least as impressive as Deandre Ayton\u2019s offensive efficiency or Wendell Carter Jr.\u2019s defensive presence. Most importantly for him, Jackson Jr.\u2019s game is growing in a healthy atmosphere. Of June\u2019s top 10 picks, only he and Mohamed Bamba (Orlando) play for teams currently in playoff position. The experience is invaluable to Jackson \u2014 just as he is proving invaluable to the Grizzlies. The Mavs rookie is probably more concerned about his 2-for-13 shooting performance than a rapid-fire highlight. Still, who saw this double order of LeBron denials being served by the 19-year-old Slovenian? Doncic also appeared to get the better of James when he drew an offensive foul on the four-time Kia MVP later in the same quarter. Lebron made it clear in postgame interviews that the collision was very much intentional on his part. The Rockets were far from perfect before Chris Paul missed three games with a strained hamstring. The time without him was brutal. Houston ol\u00e9 -d its way to a 128.8 defensive rating in that stretch. The worst team in the league (Cleveland) is 14 points better than that. With their second point guard, the Rockets looked a whole lot better in their 136-105 romp over San Antonio. Paul clocked in for 14 points and 10 assists, allowing Harden to carry just a little bit less of the mammoth load he has shouldered. Clint Capela (27 points, 12 rebounds) benefitted from their joint presence. Eric Gordon and Gerald Green combined for half of the Rockets\u2019 season-high 22 3-pointers. Houston still faces challenges. The Spurs are a mid-range slog that exacts little defensive elasticity. The Rockets face six West teams ahead of them in the standings over the first half of December. With or without Paul, that stretch could define the first half of their season. With him would probably be better. It\u2019s weird times for the Spurs. The old guard is gone. They\u2019re sitting next to Phoenix in the standings (visually, if not record-wise). Most alarming of all, Friday\u2019s setback to Houston saw them lose by 31 or more in consecutive games for the first time since 1987. That was the same year San Antonio drafted David Robinson. Kyrie Irving was the Cavs\u2019 point guard for six years. Cleveland\u2019s new guy, Collin Sexton, found out first-hand just how big those shoes are. Clothes speak louder than words, and none were louder than those worn in honor of the late Craig Sager roughly two years after his passing. Coaches, players and even NBA officials continue to pay their flamboyant respects.

But so is the stuff between the highlights. Here are some things you may have missed from the last week (or so) of games\u2026 For all videos, press the SLOW-MO button at the bottom right to watch in slow motion. Fri. Nov. 23 \u2013 Memphis at LA Clippers Not breaking news: Mike Conley and Marc Gasol are pretty good and when they\u2019re both healthy, the Memphis Grizzlies are pretty good too. The 12-8 Grizzlies have been winning more with defense ( they rank fifth defensively ) than offense ( 21st ), but there have still been some flurries of offensive brilliance from their two stars. One of those flurries took place in the second quarter in L.A. last Friday, when the Clippers couldn\u2019t figure out how to stop the Conley-Gasol pick-and-roll, which produced five scores in less than four minutes \u2026 Wed. Nov. 26 \u2013 Utah at Brooklyn After dealing with an ankle injury in the preseason, Allen Crabbe shot just 27 percent from 3-point range through his first 15 games. Since then though, Crabbe has looked more like the guy who ranked second in 3-point percentage two seasons ago , making 18 (44 percent) of his 41 attempts from beyond the arc . The improved shooting makes the plays the Nets run for Crabbe look better. Here are a couple of those plays from Brooklyn\u2019s loss to the Jazz on Wednesday. The first is a sideline out-of-bounds play. Crabbe inbounds the ball and runs off two screens (from D\u2019Angelo Russell and Jarrett Allen). Ricky Rubio switches onto him on the first screen (the Jazz switch 1-4), but is then trailing after the second screen (the Jazz typically don\u2019t switch with their centers). When Crabbe fakes like he\u2019s going to set a screen for Joe Harris, Rubio hesitates, thinking he\u2019s going to switch that screen. But Crabbe never sets it and slips out to the left corner, where Harris finds him for an open 3-pointer before Rubio can recover. The second play is the first possession of the third quarter. Crabbe again fakes like he\u2019s setting a screen (this one for Russell), and his man (Joe Ingles) switches it. Rubio never actually feels the screen, so he\u2019s late to switch out to Crabbe, who gets a back-screen from Allen as he flares out to the right wing. Wed. Nov. 21 \u2013 New Orleans at Philadelphia You don\u2019t often see baseline out-of-bounds plays get layups. But if you were watching the fourth quarter of the Pelicans-Sixers game last Wednesday, you saw the same play (from difference sides of the basket and against different defenders) get two layups from E\u2019Twaun Moore. In both cases, the two Sixers guarding the Pelicans at the free-throw line don\u2019t want to leave their guys, where just a little hedge off of them could allow Moore\u2019s defender (Wilson Chandler on the first play, J.J. Redick on the second) to recover. Wed. Nov. 21 \u2013 Phoenix at Chicago A switching defense is meant to keep the defenders in between the offensive players and the basket. But with a screen that\u2019s set at a good angle and a strong seal, Jabari Parker takes advantage of the Suns switching the screen he sets for Cameron Payne. Payne passes across to Robin Lopez, who makes a perfect pass to Parker rolling to the basket. Fri. Nov. 23 \u2013 Boston at Atlanta At the end of the second quarter last Friday, the Hawks twice caught the Celtics anticipating screens that Alex Len never set. First, with Len looking like he\u2019s going to set a ball screen for Jeremy Lin, Kyrie Irving takes a step to his left, giving Lin an opening to get into the paint. Len never sets that ball screen and instead turns to set a pin-down screen for Justin Anderson in the right corner. Gordon Hayward anticipates that screen and when he takes a step toward it, Anderson goes back door and Hayward has to foul him. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Per The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, the Memphis Grizzlies have agreed to a one-year, veteran\u2019s minimum deal with Noah. He is expected to travel to Memphis on Sunday and sign his deal early next week. A week ago, The New York Times \u2018 Marc Stein reported that the Grizzlies were in talks with Noah in hopes of signing him. The New York Knicks waived the 33-year-old center Noah in mid-October. He had two years and $37.8 million remaining on his contract. Noah had been away from the team since clashing with former coach Jeff Hornacek last season, when he appeared in just seven games. The Knicks had already decided he wouldn\u2019t rejoin the club under new coach David Fizdale but were hoping they could find a long shot trade to get something back for him without having to cut him. The New York native signed with his hometown team in 2016 and drew a loud ovation in his first appearance at Madison Square Garden, where he was introduced as being from the Hell\u2019s Kitchen section of the city, rather than from Florida, the team he helped win two NCAA championships. The Chicago Bulls selected him with the ninth overall pick in the 2007 draft. He had great years with the Bulls, highlighted by being voted Defensive Player of the Year and first-team All-NBA in 2014. But Noah had begun battling injuries and already was in decline by the time former Knicks President Phil Jackson gave him a $72 million, four-year contract, and Noah could never regain his old form. His first season in New York ended early when he was suspended 20 games by the NBA in March 2017 for a failed drug test, a suspension that carried into the 2017-18 season. He was unable to regain his rotation spot once he was eligible to return and didn\u2019t play again following his argument with Hornacek after playing 4+ minutes in a loss at Golden State on Jan. 23. Noah finished with an average of 4.6 points and 7.9 rebounds with New York. His $18.6 million salary for this season will count fully against the salary cap and the Knicks can stretch out the remainder of his salary over multiple seasons. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":37201,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-week-7-2018-19","date":"2018-11-30","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Hype-free Harris heads up Clippers' rise to top in West","content":" Quick, name the best player on the best team in the Western Conference \u2026 without looking it up. If you didn\u2019t say Tobias Harris of the LA Clippers, you\u2019d be wrong. He and the Clippers sit atop the Western Conference standings this morning, a game ahead of both the Denver Nuggets and Golden State Warriors in a fierce chase for the top spot. Doc Rivers is (rightly) being praised for one the finest coaching jobs of his career and veteran super-sixth man Lou Williams is the player Rivers often turns to with a game on the line. But it\u2019s the versatile Harris who has truly had a breakout start to his season. Sure, Montrezl Harrell has been a monster off the bench and rookie point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to turn heads with his play. But it\u2019s the criminally underrated Harris that has become the most versatile piece on Rivers\u2019 new-look squad. The 6-foot-9, 235-pound Harris leads the Clippers in both scoring ( 21.7 points per game ) and rebounding ( 8.7 rebounds per game ), the same way he did in Thursday night\u2019s win in Sacramento . Harris has done all of this with little to no hype outside of Clipper Nation. That could change, and probably should change, if he continues to put in the kind of work he has through the first 21 games of the season. And there\u2019s no doubt Harris looks as comfortable with the Clippers as he has during any of his other stops (Milwaukee, Orlando and Detroit) during his previous seven seasons in the league. He\u2019s posted the best shooting numbers of his career ( 52.6 percent overall and 44 percent on 3-pointers ) and, on a team without an All-Star anchor, Harris might be the best option to change that fact come NBA All-Star 2019 in Feburary. In the meantime, the reigning Western Conference Player of the Week will have to settle for inclusion on this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder (he\u2019s sandwiched between the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Kyle Lowry and the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 Anthony Davis). That is, after all, where you usually find the best player on the best team in the Western Conference. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  27.3 points, 12.9 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.3 blocks Shaquille O\u2019Neal says he\u2019s handing over the Superman cape to Giannis after watching \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d do damage through the first quarter of the season . That sort of Hall of Fame endorsement goes a long way around here, not that we didn\u2019t already have Antetokounmpo at the top of the list for the better part of the past month. The whole world has witnessed the rise of Giannis and the Bucks. He\u2019s been unstoppable, dominating on both ends, but particularly in punishing defenders around the rim. The Bulls got a full dose of dominant Giannis Wednesday night when he pounded them for 36 points (on 14-for-21 shooting), 11 rebounds, eight assists, two blocks and a steal in a tidy 34 minutes in a 116-113 win. He\u2019s scored 33 or more points in four of his past five games and has rung up seven straight double-doubles as the Bucks continue to chase the Toronto Raptors for the Eastern Conference\u2019s top spot. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.0 points, 13.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 2.0 blocks Perhaps the only player in the league who has been as dominant as Antetokounmpo so far this season, Embiid continues to show off his dazzling array of skills in a jumbo package. Jimmy Butler\u2019s addition to the mix has done nothing to take away from Embiid\u2019s ability to control the action. That\u2019s exactly what he did in Wednesday\u2019s rout of the New York Knicks (he finished with 26 points, 14 rebounds, seven assists and one block and one steal). And that performance came on the heels of a 32-point, 12-rebound, four-assist, two-block effort in Sunday\u2019s win over Brooklyn . The Sixers are riding the wave as Embiid continues to crush it on both ends of the floor (he\u2019s shooting .525 from the floor and 14.8 rebounds in his past five games). The scariest part for the rest of the league is that Embiid and Ben Simmons are still adjusting to play with Butler. As they continue to grow and develop that chemistry, with Embiid as the ringleader, they\u2019ll keep rising in the East. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  28.1 points, 8.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 1.4 steals LeBron bounced back from a season-low 14-point effort in Tuesday\u2019s loss to Denver exactly the way you\u2019d expect from a four-time Kia MVP doing his best rope-a-dope on Father Time. His 38 points (and nine rebounds, seven assists and two blocks) in Thursday\u2019s win over the Indiana Pacers showcased all of the reasons why the Lakers have to be taken seriously as a playoff factor this season. LeBron scored 12 of his points in the final five minutes to keep the Lakers from squandering an early 24-point lead. It was the perfect rebound from the Lakers\u2019 first back-to-back losing stumble in a month. Twenty-one games into his tenure with this storied franchise and LeBron says he\u2019s still battling his own instincts when it comes to taking over games or ceding control to the Lakers\u2019 youngsters. The fact is, the Lakers cannot afford for him to do anything other than close the way he did against the Pacers. There\u2019s too much at stake. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  24.3 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.8 steals Leonard and Kyle Lowry have led the Raptors to the best start (a league-best 19-4) in franchise history, confirming GM Masai Ujiri\u2019s offseason overhaul was the right move for the franchise. If Thursday\u2019s instant classic against the Warriors is a preview of what could be in June, that\u2019s a Finals matchup the entire basketball world would love. Leonard led the Raptors with a season-high 37 points (eight rebounds, three assists) in the overtime win, and also took the defensive challenge of trying to slow down Durant. Although Durant scored a season-high 51 points, Leonard\u2019s defensive work down the stretch was critical in the win. And as for anyone still questioning his leadership credentials \u2026 Leonard will let the results do all the talking for him. Last week:  Part of \u201cand five more\u201d Season stats:  29.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 6.1 assists, 1.1 blocks Durant walked out of Scotiabank Arena last night with everything but the win after shredding the Raptors for 51 points in an overtime thriller . It was Durant\u2019s third straight game with 40 or more points, and the Warriors became the first team since the 1961-62 Los Angeles Lakers to have three different players (Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson) score 50 or more points in the same season. Durant collected his on a filthy 18-for-31 shooting effort, which included a 4-for-7 showing in 3-pointers. He also grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out six assists while going against a fellow former Finals MVP in Leonard. Durant has shouldered an even bigger load than normal with injured stars Curry (11 straight games) and Draymond Green (eight) in street clothes. But they\u2019ll have the band back together again for Saturday night\u2019s game in Detroit ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). * * * 6.  Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 7.

That was in October. Kevin Durant attempted to halt their road woes in Toronto with a virtuoso performance himself, pouring in 51 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. In a game labeled as a potential NBA Finals preview, however, the Raptors survived for a 131-128 win in overtime on Thursday. With news that Stephen Curry would sit one more game with a groin injury, Durant went full takeover mode down the stretch for the Warriors, bringing the ball up court and draining a fusillade of pull-up jumpers and contested 3s. He\u2019s averaging 48 points over his last three games and became the third Warrior to drop 50 points this season. The 1961-62 Lakers are the only other team in NBA history to have three players reach such a threshold in the same season (Elgin Baylor, Rudy LaRusso and Jerry West). Durant\u2019s night was countered by an elite outing from Kawhi Leonard, who hadn\u2019t faced Golden State since Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals when he suffered a series-ending ankle injury. The two All-Stars matched up against each other throughout the game to stage an epic duel. Durant drilled an insane corner 3 over Leonard to force overtime, and Leonard stripped Durant during the extra period to prompt a clutch turnover. Leonard finished with a season-high 37 points, while Pascal Siakam notched a career-high 26 points on just 10 shots as Toronto extended its win streak to seven. It\u2019s not quite on the level of the legendary GIF of \u201cWee-Bey\u201d from \u201cThe Wire\u201d , but Drake had one shocked face after Durant connected on a 3-pointer near the Toronto logo. Durant gave the \u201cScorpion\u201d rapper and courtside heckler his jersey after the contest. With Jimmy V Week underway, both TNT and ESPN will honor the late Craig Sager during their broadcasts this week. The \u201cInside The NBA\u201d crew made the announcement during their pregame show, donning vibrant attire inspired by Sager.  Others, including Raptors coach Nick Nurse and Lakers boss Luke Walton, joined in, too. The last time LeBron James matched up against the Pacers he went off for 45 points to avoid a first-round playoff exit. Thursday\u2019s game ended in triumph as well with the Lakers star registering 38 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. With the performance, James surpassed Karl Malone for the third-most 30-point games in NBA history. What\u2019s with the Lakers point guards being right at the basket with an open look but passing instead?

However, he\u2019s set to play when the Lakers host the Indiana Pacers on Thursday. ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Ball sprained his left ankle in the second quarter vs. Denver, briefly reappearing in the third quarter before sitting down for the night. He finished with seven points on 3-for-6 shooting as well as five rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes of play.

The Cleveland Cavaliers have traded Korver, one of the best deep outside shooters in NBA history, to the Utah Jazz. In exchange for Korver, the Cavs will get guard Alec Burks \u2014 and his expiring contract \u2014 along with two future second-round draft picks. Both teams officially announced the trade Thursday afternoon. The picks the Cavs are receiving in the deal are Utah\u2019s own 2020 second round pick and a 2021 second round pick from the Washington Wizards via the Jazz. \u201cKyle\u2019s on-court accomplishments are well known,\u201d Cavaliers GM Koby Altman said in a statement . \u201cMore importantly, though, Kyle is a great person and teammate. He sets an example in everything he does. His work ethic, character and dependability are all at a very special level and something we will always respect and be thankful for. We wish Kyle and his family the best as he continues his career back in Salt Lake City.\u201d The trade was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski as well as several other media outlets on Wednesday. In Burks, the Cavs get his expiring contract worth $11.2 million \u2014 something they might be able to use in another deal. The Cavs fell to 4-16 after losing Wednesday to the Oklahoma City Thunder. They began this season thinking they could compete for a playoff spot while developing young players, but after a coaching change and rash of injuries, Cleveland\u2019s priorities have shifted and the team decided it was time ship Korver elsewhere. Korver was one of the most coveted players on the market, and the Cavs have been shopping him along with forward J.R. Smith, who agreed to step away from the team after being unhappy with his reduced role this season. The 37-year-old Korver is headed back to Utah, where he played from 2007-10. At just 10-12 after Wednesday night\u2019s win in Brooklyn , the Jazz have been a disappointment so far. But Korver\u2019s range should open the floor for point guard Donovan Mitchell and others. Korver has made 2,238 career 3-pointers, fourth-most in NBA history and tops among current players . The 27-year-old Burks has battled injuries over the past few seasons. He\u2019s averaging 8.4 points and 15.8 minutes this season. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

The Knicks took the young swingman with the ninth pick of the 2018 draft , and with the team in rebuild mode, many thought he\u2019d be able to contribute right away. His fellow rookies even saw him as one of the leading contenders for Kia Rookie of the Year. Things haven\u2019t exactly panned out for Knox just yet. The Kentucky product is averaging 7.5 points and 2.8 rebounds in 18 minutes per game while shooting just 32.5 percent. Coach David Fizdale is sticking by his 19-year-old prospect, but it\u2019s clear the trust isn\u2019t there as Knox played just 32 minutes total in the three games prior to Wednesday. (Knox did log 23 minutes in last night\u2019s 117-91 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.)  \u201cI love the way the team keeps rallying around him and pushing him,\u201d Fizdale said . \u201cI\u2019m going to keep throwing him out there, getting him battle tested. But this is where it\u2019s at. He has to go through this and teams aren\u2019t going to let up. He has to keep learning, going back to the film, going back to the practice court, jumping into the fire. And I think in the end he\u2019s going to turn out to be pretty dang good.\u201d But it\u2019s not all bad news in New York. Their second-round pick, Mitchell Robinson, has been solid on defense despite dealing with constant foul trouble. The 36th pick in the Draft has the size (7-foot-1) and athleticism to become a serviceable big man, but for now he\u2019s a project that\u2019s showing signs of promise while playing 17.3 minutes per game. The biggest revelation, though, has been Allonzo Trier, an undrafted guard who has come in with a chip on his shoulder and become a fixture late in games. The 6-foot-5 guard out of Arizona is averaging 12 ppg and 3.2 rpg while shooting 48.7 percent overall and 45 percent on 3-pointers. Unlike Knox, Trier clearly has earned the trust of Fizdale, who played him the entire fourth quarter Friday (he had eight points, six rebounds in the frame) to help New York beat the New Orleans Pelicans. Trier is second on the Knicks in fourth-quarter points (94 on 51.6 percent shooting) and leads in minutes played (196 minutes, Tim Hardaway Jr. is a distant second at 143 minutes). Trier\u2019s two-way contract, which gives the Knicks 45 days before they have to guarantee his deal, is up next week, meaning the Knicks will have to clear a roster spot to keep him around. Based on his performance so far, there\u2019s no way the Knicks won\u2019t reward their breakout rookie. * * * Last week:  No. 1 Doncic only had two games in the last week, but put up solid numbers in both. The leading rookie scorer scored 15 with eight assists to lead Dallas to a 113-104 win over Boston , then scored 20 with six rebounds in just three quarters as the Mavs cruised to a 128-108 win in Houston . Doncic was 6-for-11 from the field Wednesday, hitting three 3-pointers, including a crazy fallaway over James Harden and a 40-footer to beat the first-half buzzer. With Ayton putting up a dud Wednesday night in L.A., Doncic hangs on to the top rung. Last week:    No. 2 Ayton disappeared in Wednesday night\u2019s 115-99 loss to the Clippers, scoring four points with nine rebounds and three blocks. The clunker was out of character for Ayton, who had scored in double-digits in his previous 11 games and had double-doubles in three of his last four games before Wednesday. Even with the dud, Ayton\u2019s body of work is hard to overlook and he still averaged 16 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game in four games this week. Last week:  Not ranked The Cavs\u2019 point guard has clearly flipped a switch. He has now scored in double-digits in 10 straight games and has been the best rookie scorer over the past week, putting up 21 ppg on 48.7 percent shooting. He\u2019s also grabbed 6.5 rpg and three apg (against 2.8 turnovers per game) over the four-game span as the Cavs got wins in Philadelphia and at home over the Rockets .  \u201cHe continues to get better,\u201d coach Larry Drew said . \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some games where he won\u2019t be as good from a shooting standpoint. But his effort is there every single night, he plays with a lot of energy. He\u2019s continuing to grow and learn. That\u2019s the most important thing for him right now coming in as a rookie because it\u2019s tough enough to come in at that position as a rookie. He\u2019s doing well with it.\u201d Last week:  N o. 3 The Clippers have won three straight, and their rookie has been key. In those three games, Gilgeous-Alexander has averaged 11.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg and 4.3 apg. He\u2019s playing almost 30 minutes a night and rose to coach Doc Rivers\u2019 challenge in Portland on Sunday, helping stifle the Blazers\u2019 backcourt and rally LA to a 104-100 win . Gilgeous-Alexander scored 10 of his 12 points in a key third-quarter run . His numbers aren\u2019t as impressive as some of the other rookies around him, but being a leader of a first-place team at the age of 20 earns him some serious credit in these rankings. Last week:  Not ranked Bagley picked the right time to release a music video , aptly titled \u201cLook At Me Now\u201d. Bagley is having one of the best stretches of his young career, averaging 19 ppg and 11.5 rpg in 32 mpg in his only two games this week. He\u2019s scored in double-digits in his last five games, averaging 16 ppg, 10 rpg and 1.6 bpg in that span. It\u2019s becoming more and more clear that Bagley will be key to the Kings\u2019 future, and he\u2019s become one of their biggest assets off the bench as they\u2019ve run out to a 10-10 record. Allonzo Trier, New York Knicks In four games this week, Trier averaged 16.8 ppg and 6.3 rpg while shooting 52.2 percent (and 4-for-7 on 3-pointers). He\u2019s currently seventh among rookies in scoring (11.8 ppg) Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies Jackson stuffed the stat sheet with 16 points, six rebounds and seven blocks in the Grizzlies\u2019 loss to the Knicks , which followed a 20-point, seven rebound night in a loss to the Clippers. Jackson ended the week disappearing against Toronto, playing just 19 minutes and finishing with four points and two rebounds while dealing with foul trouble. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Young falls out of the Top 5 this week for the first time, but it\u2019s more a credit to the other rookies stepping up their games. Young helped Atlanta win two of their last three this week, highlighted by a 17-point, 10-assist showing in a 115-113 win in Miami. Even more eye-popping were the five steals Young has over his last three games. Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls Carter has come down to earth a little bit over the last 10 days as he\u2019s scored in double-digits just twice in his last six games. In four games this week, he averaged eight points and 6.3 rebounds while shooting just 35.5 percent. Landry Shamet, Philadelphia 76ers Shamet scored in double-digits in three of the Sixers\u2019 last four games, averaging 11.5 points on 57.7 percent shooting. Shamet struggles at the defensive end, but he\u2019s 11-for-19 from 3-point land in his last four games (57.9 percent) and gives the Sixers a deadly wing scorer when JJ Redick rests. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 28 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

In leading the Thunder past the Cavs 100-83 , Westbrook collected 23 points, 19 rebounds and 15 assists for his 107th career triple-double, tying Jason Kidd for third all-time. Westbrook now trails only Magic Johnson (138) and Oscar Robertson (181) for the most triple-doubles in NBA history. Kidd took 1,247 games to reach 107, while Westbrook needed only 760. Westbrook, who had the triple-double locked up before the end of the third quarter, addressed the media after the game and spoke from the heart. \u201cI am extremely blessed and humbled to be able to go out and play and compete in the NBA,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cJust to be named with Jason Kidd and Magic and Oscar and those guys, I could have never dreamt about being able to even sit here talking to you guys. I take everything in and never take anything for granted.\u201d This particular Westbrook triple-double was unique. It\u2019s rare to see a triple-double that includes at least 15 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists. Westbrook has pulled it off four times in his career, but only six other players in the past 35 years have accomplished the feat .  To cap the historic night, Westbrook delivered one more clutch assist: Rookie sensation Luka Doncic created a personal highlight mixtape in the first half of the Mavs\u2019 128-108 victory over the Rockets. Doncic\u2019s first points of the game came on a difficult 3-point attempt. Doncic took James Harden one-on-one and drilled a fallaway corner 3 . Nothing but net. Later in the first quarter, Doncic took advantage of a defensive lapse by the Rockets and attacked the rim with a monster slam. Doncic ended the first half by pulling up for a 39-foot buzzer-beater to give Dallas an 18-point lead. Doncic sat out the fourth quarter and finished with 20 points, six rebounds, three 3-pointers made, two assists and one steal. Not bad for a teenager. Trailing by 11 points early in the third quarter, it looked like the Blazers were headed for a fourth straight loss. That\u2019s when Damian Lillard took over, scoring 23 points in the quarter on 7-of-9 shooting from distance. Lillard set a franchise record with 10 3-pointers on his way to 41 points, and the Blazers held off the Magic 115-112 . Lillard, who did not realize he was at 10 3-pointers, surpassed the previous Portland record of nine 3s that he shared with Nicolas Batum. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know I had made 10. If I would have known that I would have went for it,\u201d Lillard said, adding with a smile, \u201cWhat is it? Fourteen? Oh, I could have got that, too.\u201d Timberwolves rookie Josh Okogie hasn\u2019t seen much time on the court since Robert Covington and Dario Saric arrived in the Jimmy Butler trade from the 76ers. With the Wolves cruising to 128-89 victory over the Spurs, Okogie got a chance to play 10 minutes \u2014 and he didn\u2019t waste it. Okogie made three 3-pointers, handed out two assists and threw down a powerful dunk that brought the crowd and the Wolves bench to its feet. James Harden posted his first triple-double of the season and also added six steals to join Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history with at least 25 points, 17 assists, 11 rebounds and six steals in a single game since steals became an official statistic in 1973-74. Johnson did it on March 29, 1981."},{"id":46608,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/steve-kerr-stephen-curry-return-warriors-lineup-saturday","date":"2018-11-29","title":"Kerr: Curry to return Saturday vs. Pistons","content":"Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr announced that Stephen Curry will return to action Saturday in Detroit, reports Mark Medina of The San Jose Mercury News .

Why or why not?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  I\u2019m not prepared to say \u201cthink\u201d because it\u2019s so early, I tend to believe Boston will pull itself together and I\u2019ve got no crystal ball on injuries. But I will admit to hoping this game is a Finals preview. Golden State is the presumptive representative from the West, no daring mental leaps required there. As for Toronto, it would be nice to see that club flourish now that it\u2019s had the speedbump of LeBron James scraped away as if by a massive snowplow. Anything that might encourage Kawhi Leonard to stick with the Raptors beyond this season is a plus, IMO, and I\u2019ve got to think the NBA and its global embrace would appreciate a Finals played in part on foreign soil for the first time. Beyond that, there\u2019s the Xs & Os, with Toronto sporting the depth and versatile looks to maybe challenge the Warriors more than we\u2019ve seen in the championship round the past two years. Shaun Powell :  Ultimately, yes, these will be the teams still standing in June , despite what the Warriors are going through at the moment. It\u2019s always tricky to project the Raptors beyond the conference finals, but Kawhi looks like a difference-maker. And the surge in Pascal Siakim\u2019s play has been a bonus. Forget what you see from the Warriors right now; they\u2019re lacking Steph Curry, a sense of urgency and of course DeMarcus Cousins. Plus: Nobody else in the West seems poised for a takeover. John Schuhmann :  Based on what we know now, Golden State and Toronto should be the favorites in their respective conferences . The Warriors have their issues and obviously aren\u2019t as good with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green in street clothes. Despite those guys having missed 10 and nine games, respectively, the champs have the most wins in the West. The return of Curry will result in the return of this team\u2019s mojo and there\u2019s not a team in the West that can stop a healthy Golden State come April and May. The Raptors have been helped by an easy schedule, but there\u2019s no denying their talent and depth. Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green have both been terrific additions, Kyle Lowry remains the best point guard in the Eastern Conference and Pascal Siakam has turned into a versatile force. The Raptors rank second in the league offensively and there was stretch in Memphis on Tuesday where we saw how good they can be on defense, switching seamlessly, while also being disruptive. We\u2019ll know more after they get through this tough stretch of opponents they\u2019re playing over the next few weeks .  Sekou Smith :  Could be. I hope so. I can only imagine how entertaining that series could be. But it\u2019s way too early to chew on any potential Finals matchups involving anyone other than the Warriors. I think the Eastern Conference playoff chase is going to involve several teams and their stars. My thought was that Boston would simply fill that void left by LeBron James leaving Cleveland for Los Angeles. But I\u2019m not ready to count out the Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks or Celtics yet. I think any one of them could survive the playoff grind and make The Finals. Even with all of their recent struggles and extracurricular drama, I still need to see someone dethrone the Warriors to believe it."},{"id":37224,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-teams-east-west-noticed-so-far","date":"2018-11-28","title":"Blogtable: Which teams have surprised (or disappointed) so far?","content":" * * * At the quarter point of 2018-19 , which East team and West team has surprised (or disappointed) you the most?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  So hard to choose, so I\u2019m going to give four: the Milwaukee Bucks and the LA Clippers are my surprise teams, while the Washington Wizards and Utah Jazz are my disappointments . I didn\u2019t think a coaching change and system overhaul would produce such fast results by the Bucks, and I didn\u2019t expect the Clippers\u2019 ensemble approach would generate so many victories to this point. It would have been nice if the Wizards appreciated how much their window of contention had closed heading into this season, but nah, that didn\u2019t provide the needed focus. As for Utah, there\u2019s an over-reliance on Donovan Mitchell, 3-point issues and turnover trouble that has dug the Jazz\u2019s hole. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019s more about the disappointing teams than the mild surprises (Clippers, Pistons). Therefore, it is the Boston Celtics easily in the East . They\u2019ve got the coach and talent to be much better than break-even, yet a flustered Brad Stevens is now throwing names against the eraser board to see who sticks. And in the West, it\u2019s the Houston Rockets. They\u2019re  showing signs of a team that perhaps maxed out last season. Yes, Chris Paul and James Harden haven\u2019t played in every game together, yet the Rockets were on the cusp of making The Finals in 2018. Was Trevor Ariza\u2019s departure that much of a loss? John Schuhmann : If I were to show my October self today\u2019s standings , he would be most surprised by the records of the Boston Celtics and Sacramento Kings . Boston appeared to be the best team in the Eastern Conference, but they currently sit in sixth place at 11-10, having been unable to figure things out offensively. A quarter of the way through the season, they\u2019ve yet to score more efficiently than the league average (108 points per 100 possessions) in two straight games . That the Kings are in playoff position at this point of the season is even more amazing. They\u2019ve really only added Marvin Bagley III to their rotation, but have seen a ton of improvement from within, and coach Dave Joerger has figured out how this team needs to play. Heck, if I showed my October self today\u2019s advanced stats, one of the first things he\u2019d notice is that Joerger\u2019s team ranks second in pace , having ranked 30th last season . Honorable mentions:  The Magic (not sure they can hold on, but they\u2019re currently ahead of three teams that were seemingly more likely to make the playoffs) and the Rockets (we knew they\u2019d take a step backward, but not by this much).  Sekou Smith :  The surprise team in the East has been the Bucks . I didn\u2019t see a top offensive team coming, but they\u2019ve taken to Mike Budehonlzer\u2019s system and have shoved their way into the hunt for the East\u2019s No. 1 seed. Dwane Casey\u2019s Detroit Pistons are the runner-up in that department. The Boston Celtics are a complete head-scratcher right now , mostly because their top-to-bottom talent has struggled to get its chemistry together. Disappointing might not be the right word to use on them. It\u2019s just doesn\u2019t make any sense for them to struggle the way they have so far. In the West, the Clippers and Grizzlies share the most surprising tag . And good for both of them, outplaying expectations the way they have thus far. I was worried the Houston Rockets would take a step back this season after grinding their way to the top last season. They\u2019ve got plenty of time straighten things out. But they\u2019ve certainly been a huge disappointment up until now."},{"id":37217,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-players-east-west-noticed-so-far","date":"2018-11-28","title":"Blogtable: At season's quarter point, which players stand out most?","content":" * * * At the quarter point of 2018-19 , what players in the East and West have you noticed most so far?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  It\u2019s tempting to say Stephen Curry in his absence, and the challenge that threw up for Golden State. As for active participants, it\u2019s been impossible not to notice the play of Charlotte\u2019s Kemba Walker, Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Dallas rookie Luka Doncic. But I\u2019m going to go with Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam and Minnesota\u2019s Andrew Wiggins, one up and one down . Siakam has to be an early candidate for Most Improved, with his work around the basket at both ends and wing mobility. Wiggins is a source of consternation, meanwhile, for his inability (refusal) to grow his game \u2014 and passion \u2014 to honor the max contract extension with which the Timberwolves gifted him. He shrugged his way through the Jimmy Butler challenges and keeps shrugging his way through the NBA, five years into his career. Shaun Powell :  Three in the East are Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward and Kawhi Leonard all for different reasons. Walker is doing his best to carry an otherwise blah team, Hayward is struggling here in his comeback season and Kawhi is MVP-like on the team with the best record in the league. Three in the West are LeBron James, Luka Doncic and Donovan Mitchell. LeBron is astonishingly good as he approaches his mid-30s, Doncic is by far the best rookie and Mitchell is suffering from a severe sophomore slump. John Schuhmann :  In the East, it\u2019s Domantas Sabonis . He was a Kia Most Improved Player candidate last season with his move to Indiana, where his big man skills were utilized better than in his rookie season in Oklahoma City. This season, he\u2019s taken another (pretty big) step forward. The guy is averaging a double-double (14.7 points and 10 rebounds per game), while also dishing out 3.3 assists from the center position, in less than 25 minutes per game . He also ranks second in the league in effective field goal percentage at 68 percent . In the West, it\u2019s the combination of De\u2019Aaron Fox and Willie Cauley-Stein , who have led the Kings out of the abyss. Coach Dave Joerger has given them more consistent roles (instead of changing his starting lineup every five games) and the freedom to play their style (fast and relentless). Fox has been a terror off the dribble and Cauley-Stein has improved on both ends of the floor (and has been surprisingly good posting up). Honorable mentions:  Caris LeVert, who was getting to the basket at will before getting injured, and J.J. Barea, who\u2019s been killing opposing second units with his pick-and-roll wizardry over the last few weeks.  Sekou Smith :  Giannis Antetokounmpo has been outstanding and should be the guy picking his team for All-Star weekend. Other Eastern Conference stars who have made me sit up and pay closer to attention to their seasons include Joel Embiid, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard and Blake Griffin . I know he\u2019s been back in the East for a short period of time but Jimmy Butler stands out as well . I n the Western Conference it\u2019s hard to ignore LeBron\u2019s work 16 years into his outlandish career. Stephen Curry (before his groin injury) Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden, Tobias Harris, Marc Gasol, Lou Williams and Mike Conley have all made positive impressions with their play early on this season. Good luck picking the guys who will be All-Stars from that side of the conference divide. The competition should be thick as ever."},{"id":37220,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-11-27-18","date":"2018-11-28","title":"About Last Night: Road Raptors on target","content":" The Toronto Raptors continue to shine on the road. Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard and company took their A-game to \u201cThe Grind House\u201d in Memphis and used 3-point shooting in the fourth quarter to capture a 122-114 victory over the Grizzlies. It was Toronto\u2019s sixth straight win, improving their league-leading record to 18-4. The Raptors moved to an NBA-best 9-2 on the road. They drained seven 3-pointers on 12 attempts in the fourth, and were 18 of 33 (54 percent) from beyond the arc for the game. That will win most of the time, especially when you hold the opposition to 10 of 29 (34.5 percent). Five different Raptors \u2014 OG Anunoby, Delon Wright, Lowry, Leonard and Fred VanVleet \u2014 made 3s down the stretch, with VanVleet nailing three. VanVleet sparked the Raptors with a perfect shooting night from the floor, sinking all six of his shots. He was 3 of 4 from the free throw line, finishing with 18 points. He\u2019s averaging 9.4 points per game . The win showcased the Raptors\u2019 bench strength, another reason Toronto is looking like the team to beat in the Eastern Conference. The reserves scored 41 points for the Raptors. Here is VanVleet\u2019s pristine shot chart:  Toronto\u2019s win overshadowed a solid night by Grizzlies center Marc Gasol, who finished with 27 points. For the Raptors, Lowry led with 24 points and Leonard added 17 points with 10 rebounds. Any win in the NBA is sweet, but the Denver Nuggets especially savored their 117-85 romp over the Lakers. It was the largest margin of victory ever for the Nuggets over the Lakers, eclipsing a 29-point win in 1993. Paul Millsap, Jamal Murray and Malik Beasley scored 20 points each in Denver\u2019s balanced attack, and the Nuggets\u2019 defensive pressure had the Lakers struggling to find a shooting rhythm. \u201cThey\u2019re a tough team at home, obviously,\u201d said LeBron James, who was held to a season-low 14 points with seven rebounds and two assists. Kyle Kuzma scored a game-high 21 points for the Lakers, who missed 30 of 35 shots from 3-point range. Darren Collison of the Pacers put a crossover move on Suns rookie Deandre Ayton that the big man won\u2019t soon forget. It says something about the Hawks when what happens in player warm-ups gets about as much attention as a game. But, hey, it\u2019s 41-year-old Vince Carter \u2014 one of the most dynamic dunkers ever! Then there\u2019s this under-the-rim action in the game with the Heat, which the Hawks held on to win 115-113. Hawks guard Jeremy Lin, receiving a pass from Alex Len and driving and appearing to attack the rim, fires a no-look, over-the-shoulder pass back to center Len for the easy bucket. Dwyane Wade scored 18 off the bench for the Heat, but deferred to Josh Richardson in the final seconds on the game-winning attempt. Richardson, who finished with 22 points. received the pass from Wade and let fly a 3-point attempt that came up short. Blake Griffin poured in 30 points to lead the Pistons to a 115-108 win over the Knicks. It was surging Detroit\u2019s fourth win in a row. Willie Naulls, a four-time All-Star with the Knicks and three-time champion with the Celtics, passed away over the weekend at age 84. Naulls broke ground on and off the court in the late \u201950s and early \u201960s. His Knicks teammates named him a team captain, the first black athlete with such an honor for any major professional sports team."},{"id":37218,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ten-things-consider-quarter-point-2018-19","date":"2018-11-27","title":"At season's quarter point, these 10 things stand out most","content":" The NBA season is just a couple of months old, but it\u2019s already given us a season\u2019s worth of storylines with some more shocking than others. The two-time defending-champion Golden State Warriors, it turns out, are mere mortals and capable of the same struggles as any other team. And yes, LeBron James has had the impact everyone expected on the Los Angeles Lakers (they are relevant again, but still have a long ways to go). Almost everything we expected, however, is still in flux. Teams we thought would be juggernauts haven\u2019t quite achieved that status, or anything close to it. On the flip side, some teams we didn\u2019t see coming have made the biggest splashes early this season. The quarter mark is as good a time as any to take stock of what\u2019s gone on around the league to date, both the good and bad. What if it was a coach, and not a player, whose arrival in a new city was the biggest game-changer this NBA season? What if it\u2019s Mike Budenholzer, and not James, who was the biggest offseason get for any team in the league? Sounds crazy, huh? Agreed. Crazy clearly works for the Milwaukee Bucks, whose major offseason move was turning to the 2015 NBA Coach of the Year to help reconstitute their group and show them how to play \u201cBud Ball.\u201d They own the league\u2019s best net rating (+10.5) , best offensive rating (115.6) and a top-six defensive rating (105.1) . Giannis Antetokounmpo is leading the pack in the race for the Kia MVP and the Bucks sit atop NBA.com\u2019s Week 7 Power Rankings due in large part to their marked improvement on offense and defense. Perhaps more important is the culture shift that Bud brought with him. These Bucks play with a confidence that simply didn\u2019t exist last season.                                                                                                                                        Raise your hand if you predicted the Sacramento Kings would be in the top eight of the Western Conference standings after Thanksgiving. I didn\u2019t think so. But they\u2019re 10-10 and sitting in that eighth spot for at least the next few hours. Coach Dave Joerger has done a masterful job of putting the right players in the right positions to make the Kings competitive. Sure, they are a feast-or-famine bunch (they\u2019re either winning by a slim margin or getting bounced by double digits). But that\u2019s usually the case for a young squad still trying to find its place in the larger landscape. The Kings sitting at .500 at this point of the season, though, is a corner turn no one saw coming. They\u2019re playing at a pace (106.2) that ranks second in the league and caters beautifully to the talents of catalyst De\u2019Aaron Fox and rising youngsters Willie Cauley-Stein and Buddy Hield. The good start has allowed Joerger to resist the organizational urge of pressing prized rookie Marvin Bagley III into a bigger role before he\u2019s ready for it. Any suggestions that Joerger isn\u2019t the right man for the job in Sacramento should be silenced by this solid start. The Markelle Fultz melodrama would dominate the headlines in Philadelphia if it wasn\u2019t for Jimmy Butler showing up and showing off his crunch-time closer skills (two game-winning shots eight days apart). The Sixers already had a great foundation with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. They needed a third piece for their version of a \u201cBig Three\u201d. Fultz was being groomed for that role, but his shoulder and shooting issues stymied that process. Credit the Sixers for making the right deal to acquire a player of Butler\u2019s caliber. Give Butler credit for showing up and making an immediate impact on a team that certainly looks the part of the Eastern Conference contender they professed themselves to be in the offseason. Where the Fultz drama goes from here is anyone\u2019s guess. But it shouldn\u2019t matter anyway, not with Butler taking over the space once reserved for Fultz. Just check the scoreboard most nights, folks. It\u2019s real. The added emphasis on freedom of movement by game officials this season has produced some early season fireworks. Teams are averaging 110.6 points per game, the highest in 34 years. The pace of play certainly has an impact there as well. The bottom line? Teams are just playing faster in today\u2019s NBA. Carmelo Anthony was gone before Thanksgiving. James Harden is back to scoring like few others on the planet can ( a season-best 54 points Monday ). And defensive guru Jeff Bzdelik is back in the mix. Yet somehow, the Rockets are still a sub-.500 team after Monday night\u2019s overtime loss to the Washington Wizards. So yes, there is still plenty of work to do. Rockets fans need to file the 2017-18 season away for good. That offensive-defensive synergy by a group outside of Oakland doesn\u2019t happen often and is difficult to duplicate in back-to-back seasons. That perfect chemistry the Rockets had as they roared to a league-best 65 wins and the top overall seed in the playoffs was a flash. Perhaps this season, and the hard road ahead, is reality. The Rockets have company in the failing-to-live-up-to-expectations department as Boston was the consensus pick to reign in the Eastern Conference. No team \u2014 on paper at least \u2014 is stocked with better quality depth. Toss in coach Brad Stevens (heralded by many as the brightest young coach in the game) and there wasn\u2019t supposed to be any holes in Danny Ainge\u2019s operation. Then the season started and it became clear that these Celtics, with Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward back, weren\u2019t playing up to what many had planned. The Celtics have recorded quality wins, but seem disjointed on most nights. There\u2019s time to figure it all out, but the rest of the East won\u2019t wait for them to do so. The Celtics must iron out whatever issues are getting in the way of their consistency. We all fell in love with the Jazz we saw in the 2018 playoffs last season. The emergence of Donovan Mitchell came with all sorts of fireworks built-in. Rudy Gobert snagging his first Kia Defensive Player of the Year award was validation for the Jazz, who meticulously crafted a roster that plays to coach Quin Snyder\u2019s ideals. Injuries have slowed Mitchell\u2019s season, but Utah\u2019s issues are bigger than just one player. This a team that was a trendy preseason pick to supplant the Portland Trail Blazers for No. 3 in the Western Conference (behind the Golden State Warriors and Rockets). Today, they are behind the Rockets \u2013 and just ahead of the Phoenix Suns \u2014 at the bottom of the Western Conference standings . To borrow a word from Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers about the Golden State Warriors, R-E-L-A-X. The Warriors are not in the sort of trouble that can sink a season just because Draymond Green and Kevin Durant had a little bench dust-up that preceded the franchise\u2019s first four-game losing streak in the Steve Kerr era. It was great timing, of course. Stephen Curry goes down with a groin injury just as the fabric of this team is being stretched in ways it hasn\u2019t been since Durant arrived. The Warriors went 5-5 in the 10 games Curry missed (Green has missed six straight with a toe injury, by the way). There will be more adversity as they attempt to repair the spirit of the team that Kerr admitted was broken in the aftermath of the Green-Durant craziness. But does anyone really believe they\u2019ve seen a team capable of taking a fully healthy Warriors squad down in the playoffs? The Warriors feel the reality of the West parity now, but we\u2019re a long way from the finish line to 2018-19. There were bound to be a few bumps along the way for the champs. We\u2019ll reserve the right to judge them when they are closer to full strength. In the meantime, just relax. It\u2019s too early to tell if there is a Mitchell, Jayson Tatum or Ben Simmons among this current crop of rookies. But the extremely early returns are promising for several guys. Luka Doncic looks the part in Dallas. Deandre Ayton has been steady for Phoenix. And Trae Young has been spectacular at times (and struggled mightily) in Atlanta. But it\u2019s the work of some of the other members of the NBA freshmen class that should have you excited about the future. Jaren Jackson Jr. is a future superstar in Memphis. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looks like a franchise point guard for the LA Clippers. Wendell Carter Jr. has been as good as advertised in Chicago. Boosting the class of late is Collin Sexton, whose improved shooting has helped him shake off some early hiccups in Cleveland, and Marvin Bagley III surging in Sacramento. There is star power among this group, potentially much more than initially projected. If we were handing out hardware now instead of in April, Doc Rivers would be the runaway favorite for Coach of the Year. In an early season full of surprises, no one has shocked the system more than that \u201cother\u201d team in Los Angeles. The Clippers are winning without a superstar anchor (sorry Lou Williams, sixth-man extraordinaire) and without the hype that has accompanied the start of this season for their Staples Center roommates in purple and gold. LeBron has everyone in his orbit captivated wherever he plays. But while all eyes are on LeBron\u2019s Lakers, the Clippers have gone about their business and become a team of real substance. They\u2019ve already scored wins over the Warriors, Bucks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, Spurs and Rockets (twice). That\u2019s solid work for a team that was an afterthought in their own city heading into this season. The Lakers are looking up at the Clippers in the Pacific Division today and it will be interesting to see how long that all lasts. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The answer would normally conjure images that include but are not limited to graying temples, a stoic expression and a volleyball gut because those fit the stereotype of many old-school members of the Fat Cat Club. Then there\u2019s the guy who walks into the Pepsi Center on game night and immediately greets someone he knows with a bro-hug and a wazzup. There\u2019s a reason the boss raises the cool factor in any room he enters and looks younger than his Denver Nuggets executives because, well, he is. The hair, smile and slim-cut suit give the appearance and personality of someone who doesn\u2019t intimidate his employees. As he walked down the hall past the locker room, and once out of sight, an arena worker, obviously new on the job, asked another: \u201cWho was that guy?\u201d \u201cHe owns the place.\u201d \u201cNo, really?\u201d Well, not really. But might as well. In the not-too-distant future, Nuggets team president Josh Kroenke could become the most powerful owner in sports. The 38-year-old is formally the Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports & Entertainment and Kroenke Sports & Entertainment UK, but his title is hardly a hollow one. He serves on the Board of Governors in the NHL and NBA, is a member of the NBA\u2019s Planning Committee, an Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids (MLS) and sits on the board of Arsenal Football Club of the English Premier League. He controls this end of the family business, and business is booming by the way, especially on the basketball court. At 13-7 and in third place in the Western Conference , the Nuggets are making an early bid to crash NBA elite territory, helped by the people Kroenke wisely put in place. His father, Stan Kroenke, bought the Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, Pepsi Center, the Los Angeles Rams and also Arsenal, the fabled European soccer team. He is building the new bazillion-dollar NFL stadium in LA that\u2019ll be home to the Rams and host the 2028 Olympics. Pops is the sixth-wealthiest owner of an American sports team. Strict NFL rules on cross-ownership of pro teams (since relaxed) forced the father to cede the Denver properties to his wife, Ann. She\u2019s a daughter of Bud Walton, who along with his brother, Sam, created Wal-Mart. Yes, you\u2019ll need an MIT professor to do the math here. (The parents\u2019 combined net worth, per Forbes, clocks in at $15 billion \u2014 $8.5 billion for Sta n and $6.5 billion for Ann .) What do you give the son who comes from a staggering fortune and was handed the keys to this portion of the empire in 2010 at age 30 ? You give him something so much more valuable: A sense of normalcy. \u201cHe\u2019s so unassuming that you\u2019d have no idea how blessed he is,\u201d said Nuggets\u2019 president of basketball operations Tim Connelly. \u201cHe prides himself on being one of the guys.\u201d That\u2019s true, although those optics only go so deep. It would be a mistake, for example, to assume Kroenke lacks corporate skin. He\u2019s had to get his hands grimy and replace front-office types. He let George Karl go fresh after he won the Coach of the Year award. He coped with Carmelo Anthony\u2019s trade demands in 2011 when the Nuggets had little leverage with the star or the trade market. And, he spruced up a team gone stale, all before turning 40. Still, it comes as reassuring to the people who know him, work with him and work for him that Josh\u2019s last name isn\u2019t Hilton. This isn\u2019t a spoiled rich kid gone wild. He has flown Southwest! He asks to be called \u201cJosh.\u201d He\u2019ll bring his two English bulldogs to the office and let them frolic. When he and former Nuggets GM Masai Ujiri (now with the Raptors) were hungry once while stuck in an airport, guess who went and fetched the food? When Kroenke first started working in the family business in 2007, he shagged free throws for players at practice, even the bench-warmers. As a side bonus, Kroenke can whip every other NBA owner in a game of one-on-one with the exception of the guy who signs checks for the Charlotte Hornets. It is basketball, which he played in AAU and for four years on the Division I level, that Kroenke credits for helping shape his outlook on life. It exposed him to other people and cultures and made him keenly receptive while running the Nuggets. Things might\u2019ve turned out differently if, say, Kroenke went total country club and did equestrian or lacrosse. Pickup hoops kept him humble because when you lace them up, it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from or what your folks do or how much you got . Instead, it\u2019s: Do you have what it takes to stay on the court? \u201cIn a roundabout way, being around sports helped me a lot, and I\u2019m glad life took me in that direction,\u201d Josh Kroenke said. \u201cPlaying basketball helps you understand at a young age how truly fortunate you are, and what you have is not something to be flaunted; it\u2019s something you can count as a blessing. I don\u2019t rest on any laurels. It\u2019s how can I be better today and how can I make the people around me better.\u201d As you might imagine, or maybe you can\u2019t, being born into Monopoly money had its privileges for Josh and sister Whitney in Columbia, Mo. But every day wasn\u2019t Christmas, in that Stan and Ann tried to make their household as typical as possible to keep their kids down to earth; Josh went to public school. And he said there was one rule his parents insisted was non-negotiable: \u201cNo matter what position you are in life, my dad told me, \u2018Treat people the way you want to be treated.\u2019 I could do a lot of things when I was a kid but the one thing that would get me in trouble is if I mistreated someone,\u201d Josh Kroenke said. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t shelter us by any means, but were careful about making sure we had certain core values.\u201d Once he gravitated toward basketball, he ventured into areas far from his world. In order to reach the best competition, his trips took him to Kansas City and St. Louis. The cultural gap between Kroenke and his teammates was almost as vast as the cash gap, yet the desire to fit in and gain respect made him a better player and a balanced person through that experience. Eventually, word would often leak about who and how wealthy his parents were, especially after his father became part of the ownership group of the Rams \u2014 who were then in St. Louis . \u201cEvery now and then you\u2019d hear some things from the stands,\u201d Kroenke said. \u201cIt makes you pretty tough. While I wasn\u2019t from a tough neighborhood with a tough upbringing, it\u2019s a different kind of toughness that was forged through things like that.\u201d Kroenke grew to 6-foot-4 and fine-tuned a jumper that became splashy. He was a high school star and top-40 national recruit by several publications. He settled on Missouri and was coached by Quin Snyder \u2014 who is now coach of the Utah Jazz. That makes for a Twilight Zone-type existence nowadays. Dozens of players and coaches who competed with or against Kroenke in college have crossed paths with him in the NBA. In the second round of the 2003 NCAA Tournament , Mizzou was eliminated in overtime by Marquette. Then a junior, Kroenke came off the bench with fire, drilling four of six shots from deep. A decade later during a meeting with the NBA union, he ran into the player who made life hell for Mizzou that day, joking to a laughing Dwayne Wade: \u201cI want you to know there\u2019s no one else in here who can say they dropped 14 points on you.\u201d That was one of Kroenke\u2019s better games in college as knee injuries cut into his talent and playing time and discouraged him from playing overseas. Even then, though, Kroenke bonded with future NBA players Kareem Rush and Keyon Dooling and role players at Mizzou, showing an ability to cross-connect that would later serve him well. \u201cJosh was obviously well liked, but more than being liked he was respected,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThe way he competed in addition to the way he carried himself. You could tell he was about the team, and the guys on the team respected that. You could see the leadership skills he had as a player and person. It\u2019s not surprising to see the manifestation of that in his current role.\u201d It didn\u2019t hurt that Kroenke could invite the whole team over to his house with room to spare. Dooling grew up poor in Fort Lauderdale and as he recalled, it was quite a scene and an estate. A bunch of players using the pool and a renovated barn-turned-gym, while a descendant of the Wal-Mart family happily flipped burgers on the grill for her son and the boys. \u201cIt was the first home of that magnitude that I\u2019d ever been in,\u201d Dooling said. \u201cI mean, they had everything. And yet you would not believe how ordinary things are around that family. That\u2019s why Josh has this unbelievable humility.\u201d After college, he wanted to strike out on his own in New York and after a brief stint at NBA headquarters he worked as a real estate underwriter at Lehman Brothers. He went to a Nets-Nuggets game one day with co-workers, who knew Kroenke was wrestling with career choices and his future. They asked: Why not work for the Nuggets? \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s my family,\u201d Kroenke said. The friends laughed, told him he was nuts and urged him to try. \u201cIn hindsight it was some of the best advice I ever got,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of hesitation on my part based on perception and being handed something when I tried to earn on my own way. Eventually it fell into the no-brainer category. My parents were supportive.\u201d Kroenke was exposed to the business of sports early and became a quick study as a young adult, asking a ton of questions. The father sized up the son after three years and declared him ready in 2010, and there was no other choice. Stan Kroenke was forced to surrender the Denver properties by the NFL, anyway. Josh was thrown to the fire when, not long after he assumed control of the Nuggets, Anthony asked to be traded to the Knicks or Nets . With the rest of the league watching and sensing doom for the Nuggets, Kroenke and Ujiri walked a tightrope from training camp almost up to the trade deadline. They got more than anyone expected for Anthony, amassing several starters plus Draft picks from the Knicks that kept the Nuggets in contention the next two seasons. Kroenke\u2019s next challenge was sweeping up the debris following a 57-win season in 2012-13 as the Nuggets were shocked in the first round by the Warriors and subsequently ripped apart. Karl was fired and Ujiri left for Toronto. It was a queasy period that tested Kroenke and raised concerns whether he was stretched thin or unprepared to bounce from setbacks. Three losing seasons and a sparse arena followed; the Nuggets ranked in the bottom three in home attendance from 2015-17 and failed to reach the playoffs. There was turnover in the front office and the coaching staff before stability arrived just lately, with Connelly leading personnel and Mike Malone as coach. Kroenke emerged from the hailstorm with a sharper product and a healthier outlook on his own ability to lead. The Nuggets are now balanced with youth (they have the fourth-youngest roster) and vets, with former draftees Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray aligned with Paul Millsap, Will Barton and Mason Plumlee. Kroenke and Connelly also created positive buzz weeks ago by hiring Sue Bird as a basketball operations associate , making her a rare woman in the front office. \u201cI took heat for changes we made in 2013 but we\u2019re five years out from those decisions,\u201d Kroenke said. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of what we\u2019ve done the last three years. We learned from our mistakes of four to five years ago, made the most of our opportunities whether it\u2019s draft picks or trades. We developed the culture that I dreamed we could have. It\u2019s starting to formulate. I mean, we\u2019ve got a long ways to go this season. You draft people at 19 and you expect them to be 24 tomorrow. But if you watch us play and the ball\u2019s flying. We play unselfishly.\u201d Can the Nuggets classify themselves as title contenders now or in the near future in a league where A-list free agent defections are deciding who wins championships? \u201cThere\u2019s different ways to skin the cat,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to take on these super teams, you\u2019re going to need organic growth. Continuity is unappreciated in sports. We\u2019ve had that here. I\u2019ve put trust in the people here and everyone is pulling in the same direction.\u201d From a big-picture view, it\u2019s somewhat astonishing how Kroenke has handled the load. He\u2019s active with Arsenal and spending time in London and involved in all aspects of negotiations with the LA stadium project in addition to the day-to-day with the Nuggets and Avalanche. \u201cWhen I played for the Nets and he lived in New York,\u201d said Richard Jefferson, the recently-retired NBA veteran and a close friend, \u201che would come by and play video games until 3 in the morning, then crash on the couch. That would happen once a week. He wasn\u2019t trying to be one of the guys, he was one of the guys. \u201cAnd now there are so many different things he\u2019s working on. He\u2019s not in training; he has already obtained so much knowledge about the business of sports through his father for, what, about a decade now? He knows the ropes already. Just to see how hard he\u2019s working and still maintain the same persona is great.\u201d In the near future, a handful of NBA teams could pass from fathers to children, following Jerry Buss to Jeanie Buss. The Heat, Bulls, Warriors, Magic and Pacers already have successors in place and currently collecting the know-how. Kroenke is ahead of most of them and juggling more than any of them. \u201cIn a world where he had endless opportunities to do whatever and go wherever, he chose hoops,\u201d said Dooling. \u201cHe chose this life. His sports journey helped shape him, and he disarms people expecting to see someone a whole lot different from someone in his position.\u201d He could one day, realistically, run professional teams in football, basketball, hockey and soccer and lord over a Los Angeles stadium-retail-residential palace that will be more valuable than any like it. And he\u2019ll probably be asked to show some ID when he reaches the door. Such is life for someone like Josh Kroenke, when you\u2019re born on third base and behave like you\u2019ve drawn a walk. \u201cI look back at the story of what my grandfather and his brother accomplished with Wal-Mart with awe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey grew up in a small town and identified areas that create value. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do, create value to my family and to Denver.\u201d Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

However, it seems Fultz will see more than just one doctor about his current injury. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Philadelphia Inquirer \u2018s Keith Pompey , Fultz will be seeing several specialists this week about the shoulder injury. Last week, news came out that Fultz will sit out all team practices and games until he receives an evaluation on his shoulder from a non-team specialist. Per Wojnarowski, examinations of Fultz\u2019s right shoulder will last through Wednesday in New York and no decision on his next steps will be known until later in the week. Fultz\u2019s agent and attorney, Raymond Brothers, told the Sixers that Fultz would seek further opinions on his shoulder before returning to the court. Per Wojnarowski, that decision has been left to Fultz and his representatives. Brothers said last week that Fultz would not practice or play until he saw a shoulder specialist. He also told ESPN last week that he has not requested a trade from the 76ers on behalf of his client. Per Pompey, some sources have said that, despite the team\u2019s statements, Fultz is no longer in the Sixers\u2019 long-term plans. Last Wednesday, The Athletic\u2019s Jared Weiss, Derek Bodner and Sam Amick reported that Fultz is dealing with a wrist injury on top of the shoulder woes . In addition, The Athletic also reported that Fultz would \u201cprefer a fresh start with a new team\u201d as he works through these latest round of issues. Fultz has missed his last three games and has not played or practiced since Tuesday when his agent announced that the top pick in the 2017 NBA draft would be seeing a specialist in New York. The 20-year-old is averaging 8.2 points in 19 games this season. He was on the bench for the Sixers\u2019 last two home games, a 121-120 home win against the New Orleans Pelicans on Nov. 21 and a 121-112 home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 23. Fultz was the starting shooting guard for the first 15 games of the season before the Sixers acquired Jimmy Butler. Since the trade, J.J. Redick moved into the starting lineup and Fultz\u2019s playing time dwindled to a season-low of seven minutes against the Phoenix Suns last Monday . After that game, when questioned about his decision to turn to T.J. McConnell over Fultz during the second half, coach Brett Brown didn\u2019t commit to either player as his backup point guard. Per Wojnarowski, though, the Sixers have stopped listening to trade overtures for McConnell. That seems to reflect that the organization knows it will be leaning more heavily on him now. McConnell can become a free agent next summer. Fultz is under contract until at least 2019-20, when his team option can exercised before the 2020-21 season.

Curry has missed the Warriors\u2019 past 10 games, including Monday\u2019s outing against the Magic, with a left groin strain. Per Mark Medina of The Mercury News , Kerr said Curry \u201clooked good\u201d in a closed scrimmage after Monday\u2019s shootaround against a handful of young players and assistant coaches, a group that included Willie Green. \u201cTotally dominated the film crew,\u201d Kerr jokingly said Monday. \u201cWillie put up a pretty good fight. But he\u2019s a couple of years past his prime, too. All in all, it was a successful venture. He\u2019s just trying to get his rhythm and conditioning down. He\u2019s doing well.\u201d Medina reports the Warriors may have to wait longer for another All-Star, forward Draymond Green, to return. Kerr said both are \u201cday-to-day\u201d as both Green and reserve Alfonzo McKinnie have yet to participate in a full practice. \u201cHe needs to be on the court for at least a couple of days before he\u2019s ready to play,\u201d Kerr told The Mercury News of Green. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened yet. We\u2019re hoping on this trip that he\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d The Warriors have gone 5-5 since Curry went down with his injury on Nov. 9 , but have won three straight games after last night\u2019s 116-110 victory against the Orlando Magic . Golden State will have a five-game road trip that includes a stop in Toronto (Thursday), Detroit (Saturday), Atlanta (Dec. 3), Cleveland (Dec. 5) and Milwaukee (Dec. 7). The two-time Kia MVP Curry is averaging 29.5 points and 5.2 3-pointers per game for the Warriors."},{"id":37222,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-11-26-18","date":"2018-11-27","title":"About Last Night: Wizards fighting back","content":" It has not been a banner season for the Washington Wizards. Indeed, they\u2019ve been outscored by an average of more than five points per game, the fifth-worst mark in the NBA, to fall near the bottom of the overall standings at 7-12 entering Monday\u2019s clash with the Rockets. As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, their misery has been compounded by a seemingly endless stream of negative news, with reports of infighting, caustic chemistry and trade demands. The Wizards got punched in the mouth yet again on Monday courtesy of a monster upper cut from James Harden and the Rockets. But instead of folding, they slugged back \u2014 and won. Overcoming an early 17-point deficit and a combined 90 points from Houston\u2019s starting backcourt, including Harden\u2019s 54, the Wizards clawed back, forced overtime and endured for a 135-131 victory . The game featured 13 ties, 10 lead changes and four players scoring at least 32 points. In addition to Harden\u2019s outburst \u2014 he added 13 assists, marking the fifth 50-10 of his career \u2014 Rockets guard Eric Gordon went off for 36 points, while John Wall and Bradley Beal countered with 36 and 32, respectively. It marked the Wizards\u2019 third win in four games, a modest but much-needed lifeline as they battle to turn their wayward season around. \u201cI think we all just started focusing on what we did two or three years ago, not worrying about the shot and just trying to lock in on the defensive end ,\u201d said Wall, who also had 11 assists. \u201cGuys are having a lot of fun right now, and that\u2019s how we have to play for the rest of the year if we\u2019re going to be a good team in the East.\u201d Harden and Gordon\u2019s 90 points marked the second-highest combined total for a starting backcourt in NBA history. Given the lack of balance from the record holder, it might be even more impressive. The thriller in D.C. overshadowed an equally entertaining game in Charlotte, where the Hornets held off the Bucks 110-107. The details reveal a truly crazy contest: * The Bucks led 28-14 after just six minutes, with makes on 10 of their first 12 shots and seven 3-pointers. * Roughly two quarters later, the Hornets were up 25 courtesy of an epic 63-24 surge. * The Bucks fought back, climbing within one with 15 seconds left before Eric Bledsoe missed a desperation 3 at the buzzer. \u201cThis team is very resilient,\u201d said Tony Parker, who scored 15 points off the bench. \u201cWe keep fighting, keep fighting. It doesn\u2019t matter how we do it, that was a huge win for us, especially after the poor performance ( against the Hawks on Sunday).\u201d While it wasn\u2019t enough to outduel Kevin Durant or stave off a second-half collapse to the Warriors, Magic center Nikola Vucevic turned in another dominant performance in what is turning out to be by far the best season in one of the more underrated careers in recent NBA history. A day after dominating the Lakers , Vucevic followed up with 30 points, 12 rebounds and six assists against the Warriors \u2014 the second time he reached those figures in two games after doing so just once in his previous 475. He scored or assisted on the Magic\u2019s final 10 points, nearly delivering an impressive bookend to their triumph at Staples Center before Durant (49 points, including 10 in the final 2:53) denied them. Vucevic entered the contest averaging a career-high 20.4 points and 11.3 rebounds with a 26.4 Player Efficiency Rating (another career best). It shouldn\u2019t come as much surprise that Vucevic is doing all this with his contract set to expire. But neither should it come as much surprise that he\u2019s playing at a high level, if perhaps not this high, given that he\u2019s been a dependable double-double machine for seven seasons now. (Seriously, look it up .) Keep it up, and he just might be rewarded with his first All-Star berth \u2014 not to mention a very lucrative new contract in the offseason. There\u2019s rim protection, and then there\u2019s this: Yeah, but did he call shot clock?

Markkanen has been cleared to \u201cfully participate in practice\u201d on Tuesday, coach Fred Hoiberg said. If that goes well, a timeline for Markkanen\u2019s return could come into focus. \u201cHe\u2019s passed every hurdle that he\u2019s had, as far as being medically cleared and going out and doing the individual workouts, having a controlled contact 2-on-2 session and then yesterday coming and going full-court 2-on-2 with some of our players,\u201d Hoiberg said before Monday night\u2019s game against San Antonio. \u201cHe felt good this morning and then went through shootaround and tomorrow will be the next test to see if he\u2019s ready.\u201d The 7-foot Markkanen is perhaps the centerpiece of Chicago\u2019s rebuilding plan, so the Bulls are looking forward to getting him back on the court. He was selected by Minnesota with the No. 7 pick in last year\u2019s draft and then traded to Chicago in the Jimmy Butler deal. He averaged 15.2 points and 7.5 rebounds in 68 games as a rookie. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a day-by-day situation,\u201d Hoiberg said. \u201cIf he has soreness, obviously we\u2019ll scale it back. But hopefully he feels great and keeps making progress and we can get him out on the floor soon.\u201d Hoiberg said the plan is to have Markkanen travel with the team on its upcoming four-game trip. The Bulls have been riddled by injuries this year. Denzel Valentine, Kris Dunn and Bobby Portis also have missed significant time. Valentine is scheduled for reconstructive surgery on his left ankle on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Dunn and Portis were scheduled for conditioning and weight-room sessions on Monday night, and they could participate in the non-contact portions of practice on Tuesday. Dunn is coming back from a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, and Portis sprained the MCL in his right knee. \u201cSo they\u2019re going to kind of get on the same path as what Lauri has gone through the last couple of weeks, to start integrating themselves back into the team,\u201d Hoiberg said.

He has a prime spot just behind the first couple rows at Fiserv Forum, new home of the Milwaukee Bucks. He\u2019s responsible in his game night job as a security staffer, or \u201cusher,\u201d for a section of fans in the pricey seats directly opposite the visitors\u2019 bench. He knows many of the season-ticket holders, as well as players\u2019 friends and family members who drop by. During timeouts, between quarters and before and after the games, he stands and tends to his usherly duties. But when the game\u2019s being played, Garrett, 71, catches most of the plays from his folding chair down low. In fact, the only way Garrett could have a better seat would be to plant himself on the Bucks\u2019 or their opponents\u2019 bench. Or even step on the court as a participant.  Which Garrett did. For five seasons \u2013 from 1969-70 through 1973-74 \u2013 this lean, gregarious gentleman averaged double figures as an NBA shooting guard while playing alongside a bushel of the game\u2019s legends. With the Lakers in his first season, Garrett averaged 11.6 ppg, 3.2 rpg and 31.8 mpg starting with Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain for a club that would go to The Finals. At season\u2019s end, the 6-foot-3, 185-pound guard was an all-Rookie selection with the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bobby Dandridge and Jo Jo White. Proud of his shooting stroke, Garrett spent three seasons with Buffalo, then split 1973-74 between the defending champion New York Knicks and the Finals-bound Bucks. In 339 games, he averaged 10.3 points and 10.0 field-goal attempts . After being squeezed out at age 27 of a competitive league with fewer available jobs \u2013 17 teams, 12 roster spots each \u2013 Garrett never looked back. He went to work in sales for companies in Milwaukee and Detroit before landing with Miller Brands beer distributorship, where he spent 30 years. He and his wife of 50 years, LaRisa a.k.a. \u201cPenny,\u201d raised four children in Milwaukee \u2013 Tomeka, Jermia, Damon and Diante, who spent two seasons in the NBA and still is playing overseas. Before Garrett retired from his day job, he added his Bucks gig as a way to get close again to the NBA. Most of the fans he assists have no idea that he once played for their favorite team, two buildings removed (at the MECCA when it was simply Milwaukee Arena). But a few friends around the league know \u2013 they visit before games when they\u2019re in town \u2013 and so does Garrett, who has stayed plugged in to the Bucks and the game for nearly a half century. He recently spoke about his bookend NBA experiences with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner:  * * * Steve Aschburner : You\u2019re as good an authority as anyone, given the number of Milwaukee games you\u2019ve worked over the past 17 or 18 years. How does this new arena, Fiserv Forum, compare to Bradley Center? Dick Garrett : There\u2019s no comparison. This is a beautiful place, absolutely beautiful. They laid this place out really nice. But for a half a billion dollars and some change, they should, right? [laughs] The Bradley Center was actually not a bad place to play. But you\u2019ve got to keep up with the Joneses in the NBA. SA : How did you become an usher at Bucks games? DG : Before I retired from Miller Brands distributorship eight years ago, I had a friend who was on the security staff at the Bradley Center. He knew my basketball background and knew I was always watching the games at home, and he was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come down and work the games, if you\u2019re going to watch \u2019em anyway?\u201d For three or four years, I told him my boys were growing up and playing, and I didn\u2019t want to take the time away from them. But finally one day I said, \u201cSure.\u201d I was always as much a basketball fan as I was a player. So I kind of liked it. I enjoyed the games. I work with a bunch of good people. It seemed like fun. Physically I\u2019m not killing myself. They give me a good seat, where I can see an NBA game, and they give me a few dollars for it. Now that I\u2019m retired, I enjoy it because I need something to do in the winter. Here in Milwaukee, you\u2019re not going to do too much. SA : Do you work every game? DG : I try to, unless something comes up with the family. I work Marquette games also. I usually miss a week or two and, with my son playing overseas now, we try to take a week or two to get to wherever he is to support him. SA : That\u2019s part of this story \u2013 your son Diante, a 6-foot-4 guard, went to Iowa State and then got into 19 games with Phoenix in 2012-13. The next year, he played in 71 with Utah. What has he been up to? DG : He\u2019s in Turkey this year. Last year he was in Torino, Italy. The year before that, Tokyo. The year before that, in Tel Aviv, Israel. \u2026 It\u2019s a business, and he kind of caught the business end of it. His first year out of school, Diante wasn\u2019t drafted. He ended up overseas that first year playing in Croatia and France. After that, he took a chance. Phoenix invited him to camp and he made that squad. Played well enough, but they fired the coach and went a different direction. [The next year] Utah called him and he worked himself up to being the backup point guard. He was playing [15] minutes a game. So he looked forward to the following season. Put in a lot of work in the offseason, was going to play for their summer league team. And the day before he left, he actually got traded to Toronto. [The Raptors cut Garrett nine days later.] That\u2019s when he went to Israel to play in the winter league there. It wound up being a good thing for him. He made the All-Star team in that league, he made the All-Star team in Tokyo. SA : He\u2019s obviously making more money than he would make knocking around the G League. Diante just turned 30. Has he made peace with the possibility he might not get another sniff from the NBA? DG : He\u2019s bounced around some, but he\u2019s doing real well. After a while, if you chase your dream and it doesn\u2019t come to fruition, you make an adjustment. \u2026 Playing basketball for a living, when that\u2019s what you love to do? It doesn\u2019t get any better than that. If I could still play, I would. My brain tells me that sometime but my body asks, \u201cWhat the hell are you thinking about?\u201d SA : You had a good run, at an awfully great time for the NBA. In 1969, out of Southern Illinois, you were the second player picked by the Lakers at a time when they were ready to take over for Boston as a championship dynasty. DG : I\u2019m fortunate that I was from a little town in southern Illinois, Centralia, which is kind of a hotbed of high school basketball. At SIU, I ended up playing my sophomore year with Walt Frazier. That year, we beat Marquette for the NIT championship and Walt was the MVP. The NIT was actually as big as the NCAA back then and of the 16 teams that were in New York that year, I think seven of them were ranked in the Top 20. SA : So you and Frazier were Salukis together? DG : Walt was actually going to leave school because he had some run-in with a coach, even though he\u2019d been an all-American. So he stopped going to class. That made him academically ineligible. The athletic director talked him into coming back to school, but he had to sit out my freshman year (1965-66). So he would play with us when we\u2019d scrimmage against the varsity. And even though they were ranked high nationally, we would give \u2018em a little bit of hell. Sometimes [Coach] Jack Hartman would say \u201cWalt Frazier, sit down,\u201d if we were getting the best of the varsity. My sophomore year, we beat the Texas Western team that had beat Kentucky in the championship \u2013 beat \u2018em on their home court. We played Louisville, which had Wes Unseld and Butch Beard and was ranked No. 2 behind UCLA. We played them home and away \u2013 they won in overtime in Louisville but when they came to Carbondale, we beat them in regulation. SA : After your senior season, you were the 27th overall pick in 1969. Were you excited to go to that Lakers team?  DG : I had a chance to make my way into the starting lineup playing alongside Jerry West. That\u2019s the team that lost to Walt and them from the Knicks, when Willis Reed walked out there for that seventh game. SA : So you were there for West\u2019s famous halfcourt shot to force overtime in Game 1 of those 1970 Finals. If only the league had a 3-point line then, eh? DG : That\u2019s right, that\u2019s actually a game we lost in overtime. Then we got to the seventh game. I had played Walt head-up for much of the series. But that last game, I couldn\u2019t do anything with him. SA : Willis Reed came out of the tunnel limping with a hamstring injury, and legend has it you Laker players stopped and gawked, and maybe got intimidated right there. DG : Willis had those two baskets early. But there was a lot of literary commentary going on that night. We didn\u2019t turn around and watch Willis come onto the floor. It makes for good reading. But he did lift them up, I\u2019ll give him that, hitting those shots and dragging that leg. After that, it was Dick Barnett and [Dave] DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, seemed like nobody could miss. And Walt went a little wild on us. He scored 36 points and they said he had 19 assists, but I\u2019ve got a film of that. Walt didn\u2019t have 19 assists \u2013 Walt had seven assists. Watching that game on ESPN or NBA TV one time, even at the end of the game the announcer said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Frazier\u2019s 19 assists?\u201d I still don\u2019t know. Walt and I talk about that to this day when he comes to town as color commentator with the Knicks. SA : The number of Hall of Fame players you teamed with in five NBA seasons is remarkable: West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain in L.A., Bob McAdoo in Buffalo, Frazier, Reed, Bradley, DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas and Earl Monroe in New York and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson in Milwaukee. Have you ever thought about what the great players have in common? DG : I think they put in the work they had to, to get to that level, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different now. Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, those were the first guys at the arena when they were playing. If you watch now, with Giannis [Antetokounmpo], he comes out early and he\u2019s not just throwing up shots. He\u2019s working, he\u2019s sweating, he\u2019s going at it before a game like it\u2019s a practice. When I played with Walt, that\u2019s when I noticed guys would go in to hit the weight room. That was kind of taboo back then \u2013 you didn\u2019t want to be \u201cmuscle-bound\u201d \u2013 but we\u2019d lift and do a lot of stretching after. After a while, found, \u201cWow, I can dunk easily now.\u201d That\u2019s what all great players have done. SA : There was a lot more physical play in the \u201860s and \u201870s, as well as players pushing themselves to play through pain. DG : I don\u2019t think it just happens. Jerry and these guys would play hurt, no matter what. My rookie year, I saw Jerry come down, hit the floor and cut his eye open. He went and got stitches, then came back and finished with 35 points. I thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have done that.\u201d Then I hit heads with Rick Adelman, my tooth went through my top lip. I went in, they stitched me up, and I said, \u201cIf Jerry can play with stitches over his eye, I can play with stitches in my mouth.\u201d I only got 25 that night, though, not 35. I\u2019d see a guy we looked up to like Elgin with a groin pull, he\u2019d get that taped up and have to get a shot before playing. Then I\u2019d see Wilt, who tore his knee up my rookie year. Wasn\u2019t supposed to come back at all but came back [for the last 12 games] in the season. [Chamberlain then averaged 47.3 minutes in the Lakers\u2019 18 playoff games, with 22.1 ppg and 22.2 rpg.] That\u2019s just the mindset of some of the greats. I think you have to have that mental edge as well as the physical. SA : You earn all-rookie status, yet you wind up shipping off to Buffalo in the expansion draft. How\u2019d that happen? DG : The league had expanded to Cleveland, Portland and Buffalo. The Lakers decided to get Gail Goodrich back from Phoenix and were going to trade Mel Counts. Their plan was to leave me unprotected, assuming the new teams would go for size first. Fortunately or unfortunately, the Braves took me. SA : We can fast-forward through those years \u2013 Buffalo was 65-181 in your three seasons there. DG : My contract finally was up \u2013 I think myself and Bob Kauffman were the only ones left from the expansion group \u2013 and I wanted to go somewhere where they were winning. The Knicks picked me up, and they had won a championship the [spring] before. They still had Walt and Bradley, and now Monroe and Dean Meminger. Earl got hurt, so the Knicks signed me and I played a good part of the season there. But when he came back, that left me as low man on the totem pole again. [New York waived Garrett the day after Christmas, 1973.] Then Milwaukee picked me up [two weeks later]. That\u2019s how I wound up losing in the seventh game again in the Finals. This time, it was against Boston. We lost this one after Kareem hit that hook shot to win [Game 6] in Boston. I thought we\u2019d beat \u2018em, but they had Don Chaney play Oscar full court. Oscar could still get you 17, 18, still get you eight or nine assists, but he was 35 at the time. They jumped on us that first quarter and, before you knew it, they had us down 17, 18 points. SA : Larry Costello coached that Bucks team. You also played for men such as Dolph Schayes, Jack Ramsay and Red Holzman. DG : What I remember about Dolph was, he still could shoot the ball. He\u2019d take that little two-handed set shot. Then I really wanted to play for Jack Ramsay \u2013 he was a hard-nosed coach, he knew what he was doing, we had a lot of respect for him. Then you could see that Buffalo team with McAdoo and Randy Smith coming on. They made the playoffs and got Jim McMillian and a couple other players. SA : And Holzman?  DG : If you got in with Red and could make that top eight guys, you played a lot. But he knew what he was doing \u2013 that always my impression of Red, Jack Ramsay, Joe Mullaney and especially my college coach Jack Hartman. Those guys were all task-masters, but if you paid attention and bought into what they wanted you to do \u2013 they\u2019d let you know what your role was \u2013 then you\u2019d be successful. I think that\u2019s why guys like Gregg Popovich and Pat Riley, K.C. Jones, Lenny Wilkens and those others were great coaches \u2014 they were role players. They have the attention to detail. Guys like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, a lot of star players never enjoyed the coaching aspect of it. But someone like Popovich, he doesn\u2019t care who he gets in there. Anyone who buys into that philosophy with the group ends up playing well. SA : So you went from playing with Frazier in college to playing against him when you were a rookie to playing with him again in your fifth NBA season. DG : He had turned into \u201cClyde\u201d by the time I played with him with the Knicks. I stayed with Walt while playing there, for about three months or so. And when you talk about the stars in those days \u2013 Walt and Joe Namath, that was New York then. That was big-time. I was a married man and I still didn\u2019t know if I wanted to stay in New York. Walt offered me the opportunity to stay with him \u2013 I kept my family at my place in Buffalo until we found a place. Then Earl came back. SA : Wait, you were sharing an apartment with Clyde when he was at the height of his fame and bachelorhood in New York? DG : Yep. [laughs] But they actually embellished that a little bit. He had his times, but Walt still got his rest. He was still a health nut, and he still put his work in. So they might have exaggerated the lifestyle a little bit.  SA : You came in as a rookie with Kareem and wound up going to The Finals in 1974 on his team. With him and with so many others you played against or with, what\u2019s your take on the greatest player ever debates? DG : Aw, it\u2019s kind of tough to say. This is just my opinion, but the best player to me is Michael Jordan. Now, that\u2019s not to say that other players \u2026 honestly, you could take Wilt, you could take Kareem as your top player. You could take Bill Russell because he won more championships. But Bill Russell was nowhere up to Wilt or Kareem individually. Then you\u2019ve got the new guys coming on \u2013 LeBron, Kobe. Don\u2019t forget Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone, Steph Curry. You could argue and make a case for any of these guys \u2013 Oscar! How do you say anybody was a better guard than Oscar Robertson? SA : Another one you played with and against. DG : When I was coming out of school, he was the one guy we all looked up to. I still tell my son the story of the first time I played against Oscar. I thought I was a pretty good defensive player when it came to boxing out and all that stuff, and he reached around me once on a box-out, threw an arm around my neck and kind of slammed me down. I said, \u201cWell, anybody else do that to me, we\u2019ve got a fight.\u201d But I just got up and ran down the court \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t see myself fighting Oscar Robertson. I must have been doing pretty well, and he just gave me that look. SA : What do you remember about going against Tiny Archibald? [Archibald led the NBA in scoring and assists in 1972-73.] DG : He\u2019d drive inside and ball up into this little knot, and you\u2019d never know which way he was going to come out. A game in Buffalo, we beat \u2018em and the next day I\u2019m reading the article and it says, \u201cGarrett Holds Archibald to 23.\u201d [laughs] I would have thought that meant he ate me up, scoring 23. But you couldn\u2019t push up on him, and if you backed off, he made [his jump shot]. And I\u2019ve always had a little problem with lefthanders, too. I hated my rookie year having to play against Lenny Wilkens \u2013 Lenny would go left on you all the time. I\u2019d play him for that and he\u2019d get that shoulder on me and I\u2019d go for it every time. I actually would have rather played against Earl or Walt or Jerry then to have to play Lenny Wilkens. SA : Pete Maravich? DG : I played against Pete a bunch of times. He was fascinating. I don\u2019t remember him ever scoring big against any team I was on. He wasn\u2019t getting 35 or 40. He might get 30. But he was fun to watch. SA : Finally, what stands out for you as your best game as an NBA player? DG : I dunno. \u2026 I always talk about when Walt hit us in that seventh game. In the sixth game, I hit six or seven buckets on him [9-of-11 for 18 points with six assists]. But nobody remembers that one. Wilt had 45 points and 27 rebounds in that game with Willis sitting out, but nobody remembers that either. They do all remember the two buckets Willis scored in the seventh game. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Toward the end of Wednesday\u2019s 10-game slate, we will reach the season\u2019s quarter point (308 of 1,230 games played), when we should start to take a team\u2019s record pretty seriously. On average, about 14 of the 16 teams that eventually make the playoffs are in the top eight at the quarter mark of the season. At the quarter mark last season, seven of the eight eventual Eastern Conference playoff teams were no worse than tied for eighth place in the conference , with the 10-11 Miami Heat (one game out of eighth) being the lone exception. The same thing was true in the West, where the 8-12 Oklahoma City Thunder were the only eventual playoff team that wasn\u2019t in the top eight through Nov. 29 . A team\u2019s first 20 games are only a quarter of its season, but they can be pretty indicative of things to come. Over the last 15 (full) seasons, 92 percent of teams that had at least 12 wins through their first 20 games went on to make the playoffs, while only five percent of teams with six or fewer wins through their first 20 games turned things around and made the postseason. Recovering from a slow start has obviously been tougher in the Western Conference, where things are especially jumbled right now . Through Sunday\u2019s games there are seven teams that are three games over .500, but another seven that are within a game of eighth place at no worse than 9-11. Come Thursday morning, the West standings may not mean quite as much as they usually do. But in the East, the Orlando Magic should feel pretty good about being 10-10 through their first 20 games, while the Miami Heat and Washington Wizards should be worried about their chances of returning to the postseason.

Walker wasn\u2019t about to let another monster scoring night go for naught. He dropped 43 points on the Celtics, becoming the fifth player in NBA history to score at least 40 immediately after going for 60-plus. Bucks 104, Nuggets 98 \u2014 Good teams in the NBA can rally at any point and can especially do so against an opponent with equal firepower. The Bucks proved they have that trait on Monday, climbing from a 17-point hole to take down the Nuggets behind the play of Giannis Antetokounmpo. The win helped Milwaukee complete a season-series sweep of Denver and kept it atop the Central Division, too. Lakers 109, Cavs 105 \u2014 Cleveland fans had this one circled for months as it marked the return of LeBron James to the city he led to four straight Finals. James had his way with his old squad and flirted with a triple-double in the win in an emotional game. Despite the loss, Cavs fans had nothing but cheers for James and the team delivered a classy tribute to LeBron as well during the game. Suns 116, Bucks 114 \u2014 Veteran Jamal Crawford has always had a knack for nailing game-winning baskets in his career. He showed he still has some of that mojo left, nailing a foul-line jumper to seal Phoenix\u2019s best win of the season. Although the Suns are one of the NBA\u2019s worst teams to date this season, they didn\u2019t look like it in holding off the Bucks on Friday night. Warriors 117, Kings 116 \u2014 Sacramento continues to be in the thick of the playoff chase in the Western Conference, but if they miss out on that goal, this loss may be one that haunts them. Klay Thompson scored on a putback with 5 seconds left and Kevin Durant won a late-game jump ball to seal a win the Kings had every right to think was theirs. Sixers 127, Nets 125 \u2014 Another week, another game-winning basket from Jimmy Butler. He sank a 3-pointer with :00.4 seconds left on Sunday to drop Brooklyn, almost a week to the day from when he did the same to the Hornets in Charlotte. It was fitting that Butler took the last shot as he (and Joel Embiid) carried the Sixers as they rallied from a 20-point deficit to take this one. Clippers 104, Blazers 100 \u2014 Who had the LA Clippers as their pick as Western Conference leaders a month into the season? Not many, but that\u2019s where they reside after another big win against another powerful West team (they topped the Grizzlies earlier in the week). Tobias Harris delivered all night while Danilo Gallinari nailed a clutch jumper with 47 seconds left to seal this victory. Kemba Walker (43 points, 14-25 FG, 7-13 3pt FG, 4 reb, 5 ast in 38 minutes) \u2014 The 6-foot-1 Walker came up gigantic in the fourth quarter against Boston, shooting 7-for-10 overall with four 3-pointers to help seal the win. He and Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving put on a show for those in Charlotte on Monday, but it was Walker who took the spotlight with his clutch scoring down the stretch. | Watch  | Video box score Tobias Harris (34 points, 14-22 FG, 2-6 3pt FG, 11 reb in 36 minutes) \u2014 Efficiency was the name of the game for Harris, as he delivered time and again in one of the Clippers\u2019 biggest wins of the season. As you start to perhaps ponder who should be an All-Star come 2019, don\u2019t let your mind wander too far before you think of Harris. | Watch  | Video box score Marc Gasol (20 points, 6-13 FG, 8-8 FT, 10 reb, 2 ast, 2 stl in 34 minutes) \u2014 The number to focus on here comes from the free-throw line, where Gasol\u2019s final two makes were clutch. He sank a pair of free throws with :00.7 seconds left in the game to seal a key win for Memphis as it tries to stay among the West\u2019s best. | Watch  | Video box score Karl-Anthony Towns (35 points, 13-23 FG, 22 reb, 6 ast in 37 minutes) \u2014 The Timberwolves\u2019 big man has looked like his All-Star self since the Jimmy Butler trade, and made his presence felt in dominating the Bulls on Saturday night. He rang up his third career game with at least 30 points and 20 rebounds to get Minnesota past Chicago in a game that was tighter than the score indicates. | Watch  | Video box score Kevin Durant (44 points, 13-26 FG, 2-8 3pt FG, 16-17 FT, 13 reb, 7 ast, 2 blk in 40 minutes) \u2014 The Warriors needed a win badly by Saturday, having lost four straight heading into their game against the Sacramento Kings. Durant came up big all night long scoring-wise, and made a key heads-up play on a jump ball late in the game to seal the victory. | Watch  | Video box score Nikola Vucevic (31 points, 10-20 FG, 3-8 3pt FG, 8-8 FT, 15 reb, 7 ast, 2 stl, 3 blk in 35 minutes) \u2014 The Magic continue to refute the small-ball ways of the rest of the NBA behind their star big man. He led Orlando to a season-series sweep of the Lakers and another big road win (they\u2019ve already won in Boston and San Antonio to date) on Sunday that kept the Magic in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff mix. | Watch | Video box score \u201dWe were looking for another 60 but I think 43 will do tonight.

Jimmy Butler is no Jordan or LeBron, but he has established himself as Philly\u2019s go-to man when they 76ers need him most. Just eight days ago, the early-season acquisition hit a step-back 3-pointer to ruin Charlotte\u2019s 30th anniversary night and give Philadelphia a 122-119 overtime win over the Hornets. Either the Nets didn\u2019t see the tape, or they were more confident in their own one-on-one defense with the game on the line. In an absurd sequence of deja vu, Butler teased his defender with a few dribbles, stepped back and nailed a right-wing 3-pointer that left just 0.4 seconds on the clock, giving the Sixers a 127-125 win despite trailing for roughly 46 out of 48 minutes. Joel Embiid continues to be Philadelphia\u2019s pillar of production, an early Kia MVP candidate for whom there has been no answer through the first quarter of the season. The former third overall pick amassed 32 points and 12 rebounds in the Sixers\u2019 win, his 13th 30-10 performance already in 2018-19. Yet it is Butler\u2019s number that coach Brett Brown is calling in his team\u2019s final possession, a fact that could be significant when he hits free agency next summer. More amazing is Butler\u2019s ability to answer, something he did not do well with Minnesota. With his team trailing by one possession with 10 second or less remaining, the four-time All-Star shot just 1-for-12 for the Timberwolves last season. Butler is already 2-for-3 in such scenarios with the 76ers, who have now won five of seven with their new crunch-time captain in tow. We won\u2019t blame you for confusing Sunday\u2019s Heat-Raptors highlights for a throwback telecast. Half a decade ago, it was routine to see Dwyane Wade scorch the likes of Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry for 30-plus. But this was present-day Wade reminding us of that with his Hall of Fame bag of tracks. Step-back mid-range jumpers. Drives and dishes. Even his odds-defying post footwork was on display in his 35-point effort against Toronto. Wade may be on his way out, but he\u2019s still got plenty left to make the exit ramp a fun ride on its own. Their parting was far from smooth, but David Fizdale and the Grizzlies harbored no grudges against one another entering the former Memphis coach\u2019s return to Tennessee. Nor should they. The Grizzlies were off to an encouraging 12-6 start, while Fizdale landed one of the most coveted and visible jobs the NBA has to offer. The Knicks made their new coach\u2019s new gig look even better, erasing a 13-point, second-half deficit to come away with an unlikely 103-98 win at Memphis. The victory was the perfect sample of what Fizdale has tried to mold while star big man Kristaps Porzingis (ACL) remains out. Enes Kanter bullied his way to 21 points and 26 rebounds. Tim Hardaway Jr. (22 points) continued one of the more underrated stars in the league. Surprise rookie Allonzo Trier provided another night of productive energy off the bench. It\u2019s a disappointing loss for Memphis, but they have their own reasons to be optimistic. Aside from the prolonged excellence of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol, Jaren Jackson Jr. continues to look like another gem from the 2018 Draft class. The fourth overall pick blocked seven shots while shooting a perfect 4-for-4 from 3-point range. Remember when Hornets rookie Miles Bridges had the respectful audacity to imitate Vince Carter\u2019s trademark motorcycle rev following a poster dunk against Atlanta earlier this month? Heading into Sunday\u2019s rematch between Charlotte and Atlanta, the two reflected on that moment, with Carter admitting he told the rookie, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask for permission!\u201d https:\/\/cdn.nba.net\/nba-drupal-prod\/36739b54-5832-42cb-98db-a6d631e12276.gif After a rough start to the season, Trae Young and the Hawks must love having John Collins back. Last year\u2019s surprising rookie performer missed the season\u2019s first 15 games with ankle issues, preventing Young from establishing early chemistry with one of the team\u2019s best finishers. Collins has been back five games and is already averaging 13.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists while shooting 63.3 percent. The former 19th overall pick punctuated his return with the game-winning block against the Hornets, snapping the Hawks\u2019 10-game losing streak. Despite carrying a large role for a struggling Suns team, No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton is thriving as an offensive option and big-time rebounder. The former Arizona standout is averaging 16.9 points and 10.4 rebounds while shooting 62.4 percent from the field. His most impressive production has come in the fourth quarter. After going 4-for-4 on Sunday against the Pistons, Ayton is now shooting 80.9 percent (38-for-47) in the fourth this season. That mark ranks first among all NBA players with at least 10 fourth-quarter shot attempts this season, with only seven others averaging 70 percent or better."},{"id":37248,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/willie-naulls-dies-84","date":"2018-11-26","title":"Knicks, Celtics legend Willie Naulls dies at 84","content":" Willie Naulls, a four-time All-Star with the Knicks and three-time champion with the Celtics, passed away on Sunday at age 84.

A Texas native and UCLA All-American, Naulls scored and rebounded his way to becoming just one of 10 players in Knicks history with at least four All-Star appearances. He became a pioneer of diversity in sports after Knicks teammates named him a team captain, the first black athlete with such an honor for any major professional sports team. The 6-foot-6 forward averaged 19.3 points and 11.7 rebounds in seasons with the Knicks, including a 49-point, 24-rebound performance against Hall-of-Famer Bailey Howell and the Detroit Pistons. Naulls was later traded to San Francisco (1962) and Boston (1963), where he won a trio of championship rings playing alongside Bill Russell, John Havlicek and Tom Heinsohn.

On a night of awesome individual performances , the Bucks\u2019 do-everything superstar took a backseat to no one, dominating the Spurs in all facets of a 135-129 comeback victory . Antetokounmpo\u2019s totals were impressive enough: 34 points, 18 rebounds, eight assists, two steals and a block. So was the usual array of jaw-dropping highlights, including this steal-and-slam: But the most notable aspect was how Antetokounmpo put the Bucks on his back when they needed him most. The Greek Freak repeatedly imposed his will on the Spurs down the stretch, finishing the fourth quarter with 14 points \u2014 including 10 from the foul line alone \u2014 four rebounds and three assists as the Bucks rallied from 10 down with 7:20 remaining. With all three of his assists coming on 3-pointers, Antetokounmpo accounted for 23 of the Bucks\u2019 40 points in the fourth, monster production they desperately needed to shake off Friday\u2019s disappointing home loss to the lowly Suns. Antetokounmpo had plenty of help. Khris Middleton, Malcolm Brodgon and Eric Bledsoe combined for 64 points, and all three hit critical buckets in the final 2:20. But there was little doubt as the final buzzer sounded: The night belonged to Giannis. Speaking of monster lines, Karl-Anthony Towns punished the Bulls for 35 points, 22 rebounds and six assists as the Timberwolves continued their post-Jimmy Butler turnaround with a 111-96 victory . In doing so, Towns joined Chris Webber and DeMarcus Cousins (twice) as the only players with at least 35 points, 20 rebounds and five assists in a game over the past three decades. Perhaps more importantly, the Timberwolves won their fifth game in seven outings since trading Butler to the 76ers. Granted, two of those wins came against the Nets, and now a third against the Bulls. But at 9-11, with the Butler ordeal no longer hanging over their heads like a noxious cloud, the Timberwolves are at least starting to turn their season around. In a finish that only The Starters could love, the Warriors secured their 117-116 triumph over the Kings \u2014 snapping a four-game losing streak in the process \u2014 in large part thanks to a crucial defensive stand capped when Marvin Bagley III\u2019s shot lodged between the rim and backboard. This, in Starters parlance, is better known known as a \u201cwedgie.\u201d There were still 2.1 seconds remaining at that point, but the game was essentially over. The ensuing jump ball took place at half court, leaving the Kings with just 0.3 seconds remaining with which to go for the game-winner after winning possession. It failed, allowing the Warriors to staunch the bleeding from their recent woes. (Oh, yeah: In addition to Klay Thompson\u2019s go-ahead putback , Kevin Durant was an absolute beast with 44 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.) \u201cI was just (expletive)\u201d \u2013 Thunder center Steven Adams on why he struggled to make shots in the first half of Oklahoma City\u2019s 105-98 loss to the Nuggets Don\u2019t look now, but the Cavaliers \u2014 and rookie point guard Collin Sexton in particular \u2014 are red hot! OK, they\u2019ve only won two games in a row following their 117-108 conquest of the water-treading Rockets, and are still mired near the bottom of the NBA standings at 4-14. But when you were saddled with the league\u2019s worst record as recently as Friday afternoon, and just doubled your win total in a span of two days, who are we to qualify? Taking full advantage of Chris Paul\u2019s absence, and shrugging off everything reigning Kia MVP James Harden (40 points, 13 assists) threw at them, the Cavaliers were in a position for most of the game that they\u2019ve rarely found themselves in this season: Comfortable control. The Rockets cut the lead to five points or less four times in the second half, and the Cavaliers beat them back each time. Tristan Thompson did the dirty work with 16 points and 20 rebounds, and Sexton continued his recent stretch of impressive play with a career-high 29 points. It marked Sexton\u2019s eighth straight game in double figures since interim coach Larry Drew inserted him into the starting lineup, a stretch in which he\u2019s averaging 19.6 points on 50.8 percent shooting. Not bad for a 19-year-old who earlier this month was subjected to a report citing anonymous teammates who questioned his hoops IQ. Hit a huge shot, get a free lift to the bench. Not to make something out of nothing, given that the following quote was clearly not meant to insult. Nor can it come as much of a surprise given that it\u2019s entirely possible the notoriously taciturn Kawhi Leonard has made it through entire games without speaking. But this still seems like a noteworthy observation from Spurs coach Gregg Popovich on his departed superstar: http:\/\/1066492628357836800"},{"id":37242,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/draymond-mri-toe-sprain","date":"2018-11-25","title":"Report: MRI confirms sprained toe for Warriors' Green","content":" Draymond Green\u2019s status will remain day-to-day after an MRI revealed a right toe sprain for the three-time All-Star, per Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry is expected to resume practicing next week with a strong chance he would return to game action during an upcoming five-game road trip as he works back from a strained left groin. The Golden State star was re-examined Saturday after making significant progress in recent days. He did some scrimmaging work at the practice facility, and coach Steve Kerr said there were no lingering physical issues from a car accident Friday in which Curry was unharmed. \u201cHe\u2019s doing much better and we\u2019re just going to keep taking it day by day,\u201d Kerr said. Curry missed his ninth straight game Saturday against Sacramento and also was set to be sidelined for Monday\u2019s matchup with the Orlando Magic to conclude a four-game homestand. The 30-year-old two-time MVP, who played in just 51 regular-season games last season and missed the opening round of the playoffs, was injured Nov. 8 against Milwaukee trying to contest a shot by Eric Bledsoe in transition. \u201cHe\u2019s anxious to get back, but he\u2019s handled it very well supporting his teammates, getting his rehab in every day, working really hard,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s handling it pretty much exactly as you would expect Steph to handle it.\u201d Curry is averaging 29.5 points, 6.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds and shooting 49.2 percent from 3-point range. The Warriors entered the game against the Kings with a 3-5 record without their star point guard. Last season, he hurt his left knee March 23 just as he had come back from a six-game absence with a right ankle injury. He also missed 11 games in December 2017 with a sprained right ankle. Curry missed the first round of the playoffs, then returned for Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Pelicans as the Warriors went on to win a second straight championship and third title in four years. On Friday, he was uninjured after two drivers hit his car on a rain-slicked freeway as he made his way to work. Curry was driving a black Porsche on State Route 24 in Oakland when the driver of a Lexus lost control and struck his car, the California Highway Patrol said. Curry stopped in the center median, and as he waited for officers to arrive, another sedan lost control and rear-ended his Porsche, CHP Officer Herman Baza said. Later that night Curry said he was \u201call good\u201d after going through an extensive on-court workout at Oracle Arena. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine today,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe went and played a little scrimmage today in the facility.

Detroit, the team that traded for him last January, had hoped the suddenly unwanted former All-Star would make the Pistons a factor in the shallow Eastern Conference. It didn\u2019t work, at least not right away. Griffin averaged less than 20 points per game in 25 games with his new team, which produced a bottom-10 offense for the rest of the season. The benefit of training camp does wonders. So does hiring the reigning Coach of the Year in Dwane Casey . Those were known benefits entering this season. Griffin putting up a career year at age 29 \u2014 after multiple injuries and surgeries \u2014 was not. The former No. 1 pick was at his versatile best in Detroit\u2019s 116-111 win over his former teammate Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets on Friday. Griffin posted 28 points , nine rebounds and four assists, right in the neighborhood of his season averages thus far. He was clutch in regulation with a late 3-pointer and in overtime with a breakaway slam. His spring is back; within the past week, Griffin has thrown down a pair of put-backs reminiscent of his posterizing, car-hurdling days as a young Clipper. He\u2019s also shooting a career-best 40 percent from 3, a game-changing development for an already potent offensive force. Griffin is one half of Detroit\u2019s two-man battering ram in the frontcourt. Andre Drummond decimated the Rockets for 23 points and 20 rebounds \u2014 his sixth 20-20 game in 16 games. He had seven such performances all of last season. Drummond and Griffin could be Detroit\u2019s first multiple All-Stars since 2008. But there\u2019s a reason Drummond was pouring water on Griffin after the game, and not vice versa. Griffin\u2019s unexpected rebirth could push the Pistons from the fringes \u2014 they\u2019ve won 40-plus games just once in the last 10 years \u2014 into the playoff dance. They\u2019re 9-7 thanks to top-10 rankings in defense, second-chance points, points off turnovers and points in the paint. If they ever fix their league-worst shooting clip (43.4%) , the Pistons might be one of the \u201cnobody wants to play them\u201d teams come April. Remember when Jamal Crawford and Rodney Hood took turns in the \u201cwhy hasn\u2019t anyone signed them yet?\u201d segments? On Friday, they made their tepid offseason markets look even more bizarre. Hood torched the 76ers in Cleveland\u2019s surprising 121-112 win at Philadelphia, scoring 25 points while shooting 5-for-7 from beyond the arc. Hood\u2019s effort gave the Cavs their first road win while simultaneously handing the Sixers their first road loss. Crawford, to the surprise of no one who knows him, came up big in the fourth quarter of Phoenix\u2019s equally eye-raising 116-114 win at Milwaukee. The three-time Kia Sixth Man of the Year put up six points, two assists, a steal, and the game-winner with 0.8 seconds remaining. It\u2019s not like Crawford hasn\u2019t done this before (a lot). The only question is why it took an NBA team so long to sign him for those services again. After an offseason wondering how Russell Westbrook and Dennis Schroder would mesh, the answer is: pretty darn well. In 10 games of shared court time, the point guard pairing is a plus-27, while boasting numbers that would rank among the league\u2019s top three teams in offensive rating, defensive rating and pace. In short, the Westbrook-Schroder combo is ramming the ball down people\u2019s throats. The Thunder started the pair together on Friday, and they wound up combining for 53 points on 19-for-37 shooting in OKC\u2019s win over Charlotte. The Thunder are 12-2 after a horrific 0-4 start, and their point guards are a big reason why. When you do something cool and you know it. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope tried to print a poster and ran out of toner. Dwyane Wade has always been kind to his fans. On Friday, that included the Chicago Bears\u2019 one-man wrecking crew of Khalil Mack. No Curry. No Draymond. No loss this time. The Warriors snapped their first Kerr-era four-game losing streak with a resounding 125-97 win over Portland. Perhaps the most encouraging sign (aside from the win itself) was the return of Klay Thompson\u2019s outside shooting. Entering Friday night, the former 3-point contest champ was shooting just over 32 percent from deep, several icy steps below his career mark of 41.8 percent. Against the Blazers, Thompson shot a much more familiar 12-for-21 (4-for 9 from 3).  Stephen Curry\u2019s play of the game came with an assist from brother and Blazers guard Seth Curry."},{"id":37262,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/stephen-curry-not-hurt-car-accident","date":"2018-11-23","title":"Warriors' Curry not hurt in multicar accident","content":" OAKLAND, Calif.

But so is the stuff between the highlights. Here are some things you may have missed from the last week (or so) of games \u2026 For all videos, press the SLOW-MO button at the bottom right to watch in slow motion. * * * Mon. Nov. 19 \u2013 Denver at Milwaukee The Bucks often run a set where Khris Middleton sets a cross-screen to get Giannis Antetokounmpo a post-up on the left block. But that isn\u2019t always the result. Here you\u2019ll see the Bucks run the same play three times in the third quarter against Denver, getting three different results\u2026 With other lineups in the game, the Bucks will sometimes run the same play for Middleton. Tue. Nov. 20 \u2013 LA Clippers at Washington It was noted in this space last week , via an ATO play from the Miami Heat, that shooters can be the best screeners. Exhibit B is a couple of plays from the Wizards\u2019 crazy comeback against the Clippers on Tuesday. On the first play, Bradley Beal starts out by setting a back-screen for Jeff Green at the right elbow, and Patrick Beverley loses contact with Beal in order to prevent a lob to Green. After faking a ball screen for Tomas Satoransky, Markieff Morris comes across to the lane for Beal. With Beverley trailing the play and Morris\u2019 man (Montrezl Harrell) sagging in the paint to prevent a drive from Satoransky, Beal is wide open for a three. The second play is a simple pick-and-roll, with Beal setting a high screen for John Wall. Avery Bradley stays attached to Beal and Tobias Harris is late helping off the strong-side corner, giving Wall a clear path to the basket. Thu. Nov. 15 \u2013 San Antonio at LA Clippers & Tue. Nov. 20 \u2013 LA Clippers at Washington At 6-9 and 235 pounds, Tobias Harris often has a size advantage when he plays small forward. And the Clippers have a pretty simple play to use that advantage, with Harris ducking in from the weak side and sealing his man for a layup off a high-low feed from Marcin Gortat. Here\u2019s Harris punishing DeMar DeRozan and Kelly Oubre Jr. with the duck in and seal\u2026 Fri. Nov. 16 \u2013 Portland at Minnesota On two consecutive possessions against the Blazers on Friday, Derrick Rose pushed the ball up the right side of the floor, with a big man ready to set a screen for him to get to the middle. On both plays, C.J. McCollum \u201ciced\u201d the screen, putting himself between Rose and the screener to keep the ball from getting to the middle of the floor. And on both plays, Rose was happy to reject the screen and use his quickness against the Blazers\u2019 bigs tasked with protecting the baseline. On the first, Rose gets by Jusuf Nurkic for a reverse layup. On the second, Al-Farouq Aminu is able to cut Rose off, but the former MVP just drops the ball off for Karl-Anthony Towns, rolling to the basket. Fri. Nov. 16 \u2013 Toronto at Boston Pascal Siakam has come a long way since he was selected with the 27th pick in the 2016 Draft. In fact, he\u2019s come so far that, in a big game and on a team with Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard, Siakam is having after-timeout plays run for him to be the ball-handler on pick-and-rolls. Here are a few possessions of Siakam playing pick-roll against the Celtics last Friday. The first and third are after-timeout plays designed for Siakam to run pick-and-rolls with Jonas Valanciunas. On the first, Siakam finds OG Anunoby for a corner three, thanks in part to a smart screen from Danny Green. On the third, Siakam rejects the screen, draws three defenders (perhaps missing a wide-open Fred VanVleet on the left wing) and a foul. The second play appears to be an ad-lib screen from Lowry in transition that allows Siakam to take Kyrie Irving to the basket. It may be time to add the 6-9 Siakam, a nominal power forward, to the list of this league\u2019s unicorns. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

His name doesn\u2019t pop up in those casual conversations about the best players at what many believe to be the deepest position in the league. But among his peers and those who have played against the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 pint-sized playmaker and star, the respect has always been there. Just check the reaction of Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving after Walker shredded the Celtics for 43 points (on 14-for-25 shooting, including a wicked 7-for-13 performance from deep) in just 39 minutes in a 117-112 Hornets win Monday . And that came two days after Walker smoked the Philadelphia 76ers for a career-high 60 points (on 21-for-34 shooting and 6-for-14 from distance) in a 122-119 overtime loss . Former Celtics great and future Hall of Fame Paul Pierce, now an analyst for ESPN, claims Walker is one of the top five point guards in the league right now. That\u2019s high praise considering the quality depth at the position around the league. Walker is making his case with his play, both as a scorer and playmaker for a Hornets team that has been a pleasant surprise in a wide-open Eastern Conference playoff chase. He\u2019s averaging career highs in points (28.8) and assists (6.4) and shouldering a huge load as the face of the franchise in Charlotte. And his timing couldn\u2019t be better. The eyes of the basketball world will be on \u201chis city\u201d in February for All-Star 2019 . He\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career in July. Walker, one of five point guards in the top 10 of this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, isn\u2019t wasting a moment. With everyone waiting to see what he\u2019d do next after scoring 103 points in two games \u2014 he was the league\u2019s leading scorer heading into that game \u2014 Walker flipped the script with a season-high 11 assists in Wednesday\u2019s win over the Indiana Pacers. \u201cAbout time he decided to start passing the ball,\u201d first-year Hornets coach James Borrego joked to reporters after his team spread the scoring wealth and crushed the Pacers with six different players scoring in double digits. It all starts with Walker, whose impact for and importance to the Hornets, is absolutely no joke. \u201cTeams will have to decide how they want to play us with Kemba,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cBut no matter what they do, I trust our guys are getting better and understanding spacing.\u201d * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week :  No. 1 Season stats : 26.3 points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.3 blocks Giannis made sure the Bucks secured the season split with Portland with one of his best efforts of the season. He worked the Trail Blazers for 33 points (on 13-for-20 shooting), 16 rebounds, nine assists and three steals in Wednesday\u2019s 43-point thumping at Fiserv Forum. It was Antetokounmpo\u2019s second game this season of at least 30 points, 15 rebounds and five assists. Just as impressive as the Greek Freak\u2019s monstrous start to this season is the Bucks\u2019 ledger. Winners of three straight games, they are a season-high nine games above .500 and off to the franchise\u2019s best start since the 1985-86 season. So much of what the Bucks are doing this season is built around Antetokounmpo\u2019s ability to dominate on both ends of the floor. He\u2019s the near perfect building block for a Mike Budenholzer offense, which relies heavily on quality 3-point shooting and floor spacing around his catalyst. If it seems familiar in structure that\u2019s by design. It\u2019s similar to the way the San Antonio Spurs were built around Tim Duncan for years. Last week :  No. 2 Season stats : 28.9 point, 8.1 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.4 steals For all of the great times LeBron James fueled at Quicken Loans Arena during his two stints with the Cleveland Cavaliers, you could argue he\u2019s been even better in that building with the visiting team. He\u2019s 6-1 in return trips to the \u201cQ\u201d after Wednesday\u2019s 32-point, 14-rebound, seven-assist masterpiece fueled the Lakers\u2019 comeback win in his first work trip home to northeast Ohio since relocating to Los Angeles over the summer. The reception this time was much warmer than LeBron\u2019s first trip home in the visiting team\u2019s jersey eight years ago (you remember how nasty things got then). The win snapped a four-game losing streak in Cleveland for the Lakers and provided the glaring image of what a team with LeBron can look like compared to a team that\u2019s trying to put the pieces together after losing a player of his caliber. Even more amazing is that LeBron is capable of playing at this level this deep into his career. And Tyson Chandler\u2019s been the added bonus \u2014 6-1 since he joined them \u2014 LeBron was looking for last month. Last week :  No. 8 Season stats : 28.1 points, 13.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 2.1 blocks The addition of Jimmy Butler hasn\u2019t changed the mission for Embiid. He\u2019s not shy about declaring his desire to dominate whoever is lined up across from him (just ask Detroit\u2019s Andre Drummond). And he doesn\u2019t discriminate, as New Orleans Pelicans superstar big man Anthony Davis found out Wednesday night. Embiid dominated their head-to-head battle , finishing with 31 points (11-for-23 shooting), 19 rebounds two assists and two blocks while Davis managed 12 points, 16 rebounds and six assists on a night that saw him cross the 10,000-point plateau for his career. Any conversation about the best big man in the game today has to start with Embiid, who has produced a league-best 12 games with 30 or more points and 10 or more rebounds and six games with at least 30 and 15. The Sixers still have some chemistry to work out with their new Big 3 of Embiid, Butler and Ben Simmons. And they have to solve their road woes (they are 10-0 at home but just 3-7 away from Wells Fargo Center). But they are getting everything they could ask for from Embiid, who would, of course, be the first player to agree with anyone willing to suggest that he has risen above the crowd in the big man ranks. Last week :  No. 3 Season stats : 26.4 points, 6.1 assists, 5.3 rebounds Lillard has battled to maintain his high level of play during the Trail Blazers\u2019 recent rough stretch away from home, averaging 27.6 points (on .375 shooting, .268 beyond the 3-point line) during a 2-3 road stretch that continues tonight in Lillard\u2019s hometown of Oakland against the struggling Warriors  (10:30 ET, NBA League Pass) . Lillard stepped up in a major way, piling up 69 points in back-to-back wins over the Washington Wizards and New York Knicks but couldn\u2019t find his mark (22 points on just 5-for-12 shooting, 1-for-6 from deep) in Wednesday night\u2019s blowout loss to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks. The trip home, where Lillard always seems to rise to the magnitude of the moment, is the perfect place for the star to get himself and his team back on track. The Warriors, losers of four straight games for the first time in the Steve Kerr era, will play their eighth straight game without Stephen Curry (groin injury). That guarantees that Lillard and backcourt mate C.J. McCollum will be in attack mode from the opening tip. The Blazers need a recovery win more than they need a statement game win right now. But if they can find a way to get both tonight, that\u2019s probably fine with their captain. Last week : No. 5 Season stats : 29.5 points, 6.1 assists, 5.0 assists The Warriors\u2019 current four-game slide points to the cavernous gap between the Warriors with and without Curry in the mix (they are actually 2-5 since he went down wit the groin injury). A team that was cooking (10-2 and +128 point differential) with Curry in his usual role can\u2019t find the kitchen without him (2-5 and -46). Wednesday\u2019s brutal home loss at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder is just the latest and most glaring reminder of Curry\u2019s true value to this crew\u2019s bottom line. It doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re also grinding without Draymond Green these days as well. They hadn\u2019t suffered four straight losses in the Steve Kerr era, some 450 games before getting blown off the floor by the Thunder. Curry isn\u2019t expected to suit up against either Portland (tonight) or Sacramento (Sunday). So he won\u2019t be able to tend to the mess his teammates have made of things while he sits and watches in street clothes. He\u2019ll be back soon enough. For the Warriors, his turn cannot come soon enough. * * * 6. Kawhi Leonard, Toronto Raptors 7. Kemba Walker, Charlotte Hornets 8. Kyle Lowry, Toronto Raptors 9. Mike Conley, Memphis Grizzlies 10.

Let\u2019s me know someone\u2019s paying attention, I guess. (My bad. I was off getting married and honeymooning.) And while I was making major life decisions and fracturing a rib trying to surf in Sayulita, Mexico, I was also keeping a watch on the rookies making moves in their new lives in the NBA. And things are not getting any easier when it comes to ranking these guys. Unlike my \u201c Ultimate Wedding Dance Party \u201d playlist I curated on Spotify (which was incredible, by the way, thanks in large part to this song ), there\u2019s no simple shuffle button I can hit each week. I feel like I say this every week, but we\u2019re truly lucky with this rookie class. There is so much talent, variety and skill among the class, with so many rookies doing so many things well, that my job of judging them against each other is becoming increasingly difficult. Looking back to two weeks ago, for example, I\u2019m surprised to remember that Deandre Ayton was on the fourth rung. Sure, Wendell Carter and Trae Young had had some big performances (and the Ladder does have a built-in recency bias), but Ayton has since bounced back and put together enough solid games to make a serious run at No. 1. Luka Doncic holds on to the top spot for now, but unlike saying \u201cI do\u201d to my wife or choosing \u201cOoh La La\u201d by Faces for our first dance, it wasn\u2019t an easy decision. * * * Last edition:  No. 1 Doncic almost lost his grip on this spot due to some spotty shooting, but the fact that the Mavericks have won six of their last eight \u2014 including wins over the Golden State Warriors, Oklahoma City and Utah Jazz \u2014 bolstered his case. He\u2019s had at least nine rebounds in each of his last three games and continues to come up with big plays down the stretch of these wins. The Mavs trust him, and it\u2019s easy to see why. He continues to lead rookies in scoring (19.3 ppg) , is third in rebounding (6.9) and second in assists (4.1) . Ayton is gaining ground on him, and the gap is narrowing with every dominant double-double from the Suns\u2019 big man. Last edition:  No. 4 Ayton climbs two rungs after two weeks of solid play. The more opportunities I have to watch Ayton, the more I leave impressed and certain he\u2019ll be a star in this league for many years. He\u2019s still struggling to defend like you\u2019d hope from a 7-footer (just three blocks in last eight games), but the offensive numbers back him as a force inside. Over his last seven games, Ayton is averaging 17.3 ppg and 9.9 rpg while shooting 64 percent. Last edition:  Not ranked It\u2019s looking like the Clippers might have found their answer at point guard. Taken with the 11th pick, Gilgeous-Alexander has stepped up and seems to have locked down the starting point guard job. At 6-foot-6, he has the size to defend and has shown the ability to navigate the pick-and-roll, hitting 50 percent of his mid-range jumpers to date. Over his last seven games, he\u2019s averaged 14.1 points on 50 percent shooting as the Clippers had won five straight before Tuesday\u2019s 125-118 loss to the Washington Wizards. Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s season numbers aren\u2019t eye-popping ( 10.5 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 2.8 apg ), but he\u2019s carrying himself and leading the Clippers like a veteran. Last edition:  Just missed cut Jackson makes a jump this week thanks to one of the young big man\u2019s best games as well as because of the subpar play from Young and Carter. In a 112-104 win over the Kings last week, Jackson scored 27 points with six rebounds, four steals and a pair of blocks. He made 11 of 16 shots and was a force the Kings couldn\u2019t solve. Before Jackson scored nine points in just 12 minutes of Wednesday\u2019s win over the Spurs, he\u2019d scored in double-digits in eight of his last 10 games. The Grizzlies are a surprise atop the Western Conference standings , and their young big man is a big reason for that. Last edition:  No. 3 Young is in a serious funk right now. He\u2019s scored in double-digits just once in his past five games, hitting just 27 percent of his shots and five percent \u2014 yes, five \u2014 of his 3s (1-for-20). The talent is clearly there, as his lone breakout game in that span was an impressive 25-point, 17-assist performance in a 127-119 loss to the Clippers . Young became the first rookie since Allen Iverson to record at least 25 and 15 in a game, and the 17 assists are the most by any player this season. Although his averages place him among the rookie leaders , more weeks of poor shooting like this one won\u2019t help him fend off more consistent rookies. Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls Carter slides out of the Top 5, but he\u2019s still putting up decent numbers for the struggling Bulls. He ranks second in both rebounds (7.4) and blocks (1.9) per game, but his field-goal percentage is low for a big man (46.5 percent). Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Sexton has been one of the leading rookie scorers over the past two weeks, with 17.6 ppg over his last seven games (second among rookies in that span). He\u2019s doing it by shooting 46.2 percent overall and 60 percent on 3-pointers. Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings Bagley had 15 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks in the Kings\u2019 117-113 win over the Thunder . It was Bagley\u2019s first career double-double and he\u2019s scored in double-digits in his last three games. Aaron Holiday, Indiana Pacers With Victor Oladipo nursing a sore right knee, Holiday has stepped in admirably and deserves some credit for his recent play. In his last three games, he\u2019s averaged 14 ppg and 5.3 rpg in 20.1 minutes per game. Hamidou Diallo, Oklahoma City Thunder Diallo gets an honorary spot this week after suffering a gruesome looking (but not serious) leg injury in Wednesday night\u2019s rout of the Warriors. There\u2019s no word on if he\u2019ll miss time, though. Diallo had become a fixture in the rotation, starting in OKC\u2019s previous two games. In Monday\u2019s win over Sacramento, he scored 18 points, becoming the first Thunder rookie to go at least 7-for-7 from the field. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 21 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Rookie guard Hamidou Diallo was carted off the court on a stretcher with 7:17 left in last night\u2019s 123-95 road win against the Golden State Warriors . Per the Thunder, he avoided serious injury after X-rays and Warriors doctors evaluated him. According to ESPN\u2019s Royce Young, Diallo sustained a left ankle sprain and will be re-evaluated in 7-10 days. Diallo\u2019s left leg was stabilized as he was wheeled away to applause from the Oracle Arena crowd. Diallo was credited for rebounding Jonas Jerebko\u2019s missed layup when they both went down hard. Clearly in pain, Diallo moved himself off the court and was under basket for several minutes. Young reported that Diallo exited the locker room with a boot on his left foot and was using crutches. Diallo was reportedly in good spirits, though, as he left the arena \u2014 somewhat surprising news considering how scary the play looked. Young reports the initial fear regarding Diallo was that he possibly suffered a broken left leg. Thunder forward Paul George called Diallo\u2019s injury an ankle sprain, although the team has yet to officially say what Diallo\u2019s injury is. \u201cI was hoping, praying it was nothing too serious, that it wasn\u2019t his knee,\u201d George told ESPN after the game. \u201cI think we can all say it\u2019s the best news that it was his ankle and it was a sprain.\u201d \u201cJust having each other\u2019s back. When guys go down, we\u2019re a family here and we have to have our brother\u2019s back, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said guard Russell Westbrook. In a loss Monday at Sacramento, Diallo became the first Thunder rookie ever to go at least 7 for 7 from the floor. He made both his 3-point tries on the way to 18 points. Aside from Diallo\u2019s injury, some other Thunder players got dinged up in the win against Golden State. Terrance Ferguson returned from a two-game absence as he welcomed a baby, then went down at the 5:41 mark of the first quarter with a sprained left ankle and didn\u2019t return. Nerlens Noel received stitches after getting hit in the face during the second quarter. \u201dThere\u2019s just been a lot of things on this road trip that have impacted any level of consistency, our rotation, of having any idea of who\u2019s going to be playing,\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan said after the game.

First came news Tuesday that Fultz will sit out all team practices and games until he receives an evaluation on his shoulder from a non-team specialist. On Wednesday, The Athletic\u2019s Jared Weiss, Derek Bodner and Sam Amick reported that Fultz is dealing with a wrist injury on top of the shoulder woes . In addition, The Athletic also reported that Fultz would \u201cprefer a fresh start with a new team\u201d as he works through these latest round of issues. Fultz\u2019s agent Raymond Brothers, however, told ESPN last night that he has not requested a trade from the 76ers on behalf of his client. Fultz was on the bench with his teammates for last night\u2019s 121-120 win against the New Orleans Pelicans at Wells Fargo Center. He also attended Wednesday morning\u2019s pregame walkthrough. Fultz is seeking the evaluation at the request of Brothers and the 20-year-old guard is expected to undergo the evaluation on Monday. While Fultz deals with this issue, his teammates on the Sixers have been supportive of him. Veteran forward Wilson Chandler said the constant criticism and heckling Fultz is enduring can be tough on players, writes Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer . \u201cYou go home and turn on ESPN and people are talking about you,\u201d Chandler told the newspaper. \u201cYou go on social media and people are talking about you. So I think you \u2014 and I think the same thing goes the rest of the players \u2014 try to just put yourself in his shoes and try to be an outlet for him and not judge him. It can be tough on your mentally. \u201cYou just have to be there for him.\u201d When asked about The Athletic story after the game, Sixers general manager Elton Brand said: \u201cSeriously, I have not read the story.\u201d He then added he didn\u2019t want to comment further on it. \u201cNo one deserves to go through what he\u2019s going through,\u201d reserve guard T.J. McConnell told the Philadelphia Inqurer after the game. \u201cSo all I can do is be there and support him and hold down the fort until he gets back. I\u2019m saying a couple of prayers for him to get through this. You know, that\u2019s like family to me like I said.\u201d Fultz was the starting shooting guard for the first 15 games of the season before the Sixers acquired Jimmy Butler. Since the trade, J.J. Redick moved into the starting lineup and Fultz\u2019s playing time dwindled to a season-low of seven minutes against the Phoenix Suns on Monday . After that game, when questioned about his decision to turn to McConnell over Fultz during the second half, coach Brett Brown didn\u2019t commit to either player as his backup point guard. \u201cThis news about his shoulder, it did catch me off guard,\u201d coach Brett Brown said on Tuesday. \u201cIf it\u2019s that real, and he needs to go see a further sort of consultation, then we support him.\u201d However, per Pompey , Fultz took part in light shooting with the Sixers on Tuesday even after Brothers\u2019 said that wouldn\u2019t be the case going forward. Brand said Fultz\u2019s agent told him the guard wouldn\u2019t practice or play until the results of Monday\u2019s examination. Brand said he was told Monday was the earliest Fultz could see a specialist. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we saw medically that didn\u2019t allow him to play,\u201d Brand said. \u201cHe played last night. He played two nights ago. Ever since Jimmy Butler came and he wasn\u2019t starting, I felt he played pretty well. I was proud of the way he bounced back from a lot of things.\u201d Fultz has struggled with shoulder issues, which have affected his shot, since the Sixers drafted him in 2017. The former No. 1 pick played in just 14 games last season due to his shoulder situation and shot below 50 percent from the free-throw line. During training camp, Fultz said his shoulder was healthy and he was ready to return to the team after an offseason working with skills trainer Drew Hanlen. \u201cI put in a lot of hours this summer to get up reps of going through a whole bunch of different situations,\u201d Fultz said in September . \u201cSo coming in, I feel perfectly fine. I\u2019m confident.\u201d Despite his confidence, Fultz has continued to struggle this season with averages of 8.2 points (on 41.9 percent shooting), 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 22.5 minutes over 19 games .

No. 23 LeBron James.\u201d Making his first trip back to Cleveland since leaving for the second time as a free agent, James was welcomed like a hometown hero on Wednesday night and rallied the Los Angeles Lakers to a 109-105 win over the Cavs. James received a standing ovation for nearly 30 seconds when he was introduced as a starter. During the game\u2019s first timeout, the Cavs honored James with a video tribute. Images of James\u2019 playing days with Cleveland \u2014 highlighted by the Cavs\u2019 historic comeback to win the 2016 title \u2014 were shown along with clips of his impact on the community, including his opening of the I Promise School in his hometown of Akron. James appeared to be touched by the presentation and acknowledged fans with a couple of waves. Unlike the night of Dec. 2, 2010, when James returned with the Miami Heat and was booed at every turn, this was a night to celebrate James\u2019 accomplishments and what he\u2019s meant to Cleveland. This was a homecoming. \u201cFrom the time we landed yesterday, it just felt a different way,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019m a different person. We\u2019re all different from eight years ago, both good and bad. But more importantly, this experience has been great.\u201d James finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. He also scored or assisted on 11 straight points as the Lakers overcame a 99-91 deficit in the fourth quarter. James\u2019 return to Cleveland wasn\u2019t the only reunion on the night before Thanksgiving. Several players faced off with their former teams with mixed results. \u2022 Playing against the Thunder, Kevin Durant scored 27 points and grabbed a season-best 14 rebounds for the Warriors, who dropped their fourth straight game, 123-95 . \u2022 Back in Philadelphia, Jrue Holiday led the Pelicans with 30 points and 10 assists. The Sixers won 121-120 after Anthony Davis missed the third of three free throws with 2.5 seconds left. \u2022 Grizzlies forward Kyle Anderson, who spent his first four seasons with the Spurs, received a warm reception in San Antonio during introductions. Anderson contributed nine points and nine rebounds in 104-103 victory that vaulted Memphis to the top of Western Conference standings \u2022 Former Laker Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points and spearheaded the Cavs\u2019 early fourth-quarter assault, scoring or assisting on 13 straight points. \u2022 And then there\u2019s Vince Carter \u2026 Playing in his 1,423rd regular-season game, Vince Carter became the 22nd player in NBA history to score 25,000 career points . Fittingly, he got there with a dunk. Carter pulled within one point of 25,000 when he sank two free throws after a video review overruled the original call he was fouled on a 3-pointer. On Atlanta\u2019s final possession, he missed a jumper before scoring the game\u2019s final basket on a jam, giving him 14 points for the game and 25,001 for his career. Players from both teams hugged Carter at midcourt. Anthony Davis crossed the 10,000-point plateau on an alley-oop from Jrue Holiday with 3:10 remaining in the second quarter of the Sixers\u2019 121-120 victory over the Pelicans. At 25 years and 255 days, Davis becomes the eighth-youngest player in NBA history to reach the milestone. Only LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, Tracy McGrady, Dwight Howard and Bob McAdoo reached 10,000 career points at a younger age. Davis\u2019 college coach, Kentucky\u2019s John Calipari, was among the first to offer congratulations. Davis finished with 12 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, five steals and five blocks, becoming just the third player in the last decade to post 5 x 5 stat line, joining Draymond Green and Nicolas Batum . There are poster dunks \u2026 and then there\u2019s what Karl-Anthony Towns did to Paul Millsap. Millsap, however, had the last laugh as the Nuggets beat the Wolves 103-101 . Millsap was the star, finishing with 25 points, five rebounds and five steals.

No other player in Raptors history has more that three triple-doubles. \u2022 James Harden scored 43 points and moved past Rudy Tomjanovich and into third place on the Rockets\u2019 all-time scoring list. \u2022 The Bucks beat the Blazers 143-100 , the most lopsided loss by a conference leader since the East and West conferences were established in 1970-71 (min. 15 games played)."},{"id":37344,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/steve-clifford-prioritize-health-perspective-life","date":"2018-11-22","title":"With health now priority, Clifford blessed with another coaching opportunity","content":" ORLANDO \u2014 Steve Clifford\u2019s routine is no more consuming than most workaholic basketball coaches, with a few twists. Besides counting turnovers, defensive stops and wins, he\u2019s also counting sheep and his blessings. It goes something like this: Prep the Orlando Magic for the night\u2019s game, work the referees, remind the players during timeouts that they won\u2019t win without defense, shout some in-game advice to rookie Mo Bamba, give a brief postgame talk in the locker room and finally, and just as crucial, go home and catch some Zs. Yes, get more sleep. His career, and certainly his health, depend on that. You know how coaches give minutes restrictions to players coming off injuries? Well, less than a year removed from a serious health scare, Clifford gave himself a strict sleep ration. Seven hours a night, at least. Doctor\u2019s orders. \u201cSleep is important as you get older,\u201d said Clifford, who\u2019s 56. \u201cI never understood that. I had to learn the hard way.\u201d Clifford caused problems for his body functions because, for years, he stuck religiously to an old-school coaching schedule of basketball games, basketball practice and basketball film during the season. Sleep was secondary. Long story short: He was forced to take a 21-game leave of absence last season as coach of the Hornets, almost two months, after experiencing severe physical complications that threatened his well-being. Then, after being fired by the Hornets last summer, Clifford was out of a job and his health became a topic of conversation for teams with coaching vacancies, even the Magic, who hired Clifford only after checking medical records and getting assurances he\u2019d sleep after the job (though not on the job). Clifford is respected among his peers as a disciple of Jeff and Stan Van Gundy, getting strong reviews for his defensive tactics and is the only coach to take the Hornets (Michael Jordan version) to the playoffs twice. In his first season, the Hornets posted a 22-game improvement and finished with a winning record. He\u2019s also been popular in locker rooms because he\u2019s not a confrontational coach. He gets his point across by keeping an open line of communication; all players know where they stand with Clifford. In that sense, he treated players with more respect than he treated himself. Clifford actually had two leaves of absences in his five years in Charlotte. The first came in his first season when he awakened to a bad feeling; doctors determined he had blood circulatory issues that could lead to heart problems. So he had two stents placed in an artery that led to his heart. \u201cThey put it in Friday and I coached in Boston on Monday,\u201d he said, half-proudly. \u201cI just remember saying, \u2018I worked too hard to get this opportunity. I\u2019m coaching.\u2019 So the team put restricted time in the office but I told them I wasn\u2019t taking time off.\u201d Then last December came another scare: Chronic headaches, which began two years earlier, grew more painful and kept hammering him daily. Once, he arrived at work to prepare for that night\u2019s game and started shaking. Instead of driving straight home, he walked, not taking any chances behind the wheel. The game would go on without him. He underwent a battery of tests involving neurologists, most of which targeted a possible brain hemorrhage. \u201cOur team doctor told me it was the job, the lack of regular sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in the summers, about two to three weeks into the offseason I would be fine. He told me I needed time off, right away.\u201d Then Clifford did something unlike him. He replied: \u201cI know.\u201d He came to the NBA as a coaching long-shot. He started in high school, then worked as an assistant at small colleges, nothing that would seemingly prepare him for the NBA. But then, after a stint at Adelphi College as head coach, he accepted an offer from Jeff Van Gundy, then with the Knicks, to be an advanced scout. A year later, he was on the Knicks\u2019 bench a few seats from Van Gundy. From there he was almost part of the Van Gundy family, following Jeff in Houston and then joining Stan in Orlando. The payoff was fulfilling a dream; the so-called punishment was being with basketball \u2018round-the-clock. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it was working with Jeff and Tom (Thibodeau, another Van Gundy assistant) and Stan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you walked in at 5:30 in the morning they would be like, \u2018Are you ok? Why are you so late?\u2019 I would get used to getting up so early and staying up until very late. What I did at 48, 49 and 50 years old I couldn\u2019t do when I got to 55.\u201d But Clifford embraced the pace because, deep down, he was insecure like a lot of coaches. They reach this level and never want to leave, never want to lose their place in line. The lifestyle, the money, the chance to work with the world\u2019s best players and the fringe benefits are all intoxicating. There are only 30 head coaching jobs and all are tough to get. And being an assistant coach isn\u2019t much easier, because those are based on connections. \u201cWhen you realize this might be taken away from you, first thing I thought about is an alternative, what could I do in the NBA if I couldn\u2019t coach. From day one when Jeff hired me to be an advanced scout, I loved the NBA,\u201d Clifford said. But Clifford had to learn to love his health a lot more, and in hindsight he was surprised where health was in the pecking order. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t live like this anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cMy thought process was primarily on my health. That\u2019s how sick I was. My headaches were so bad I knew I had to take care of it.\u201d And if there was any doubt, Clifford had to hear it from the man above. \u201cYou need to get this taken care of,\u201d said Hornets owner Michael Jordan. During his time off, Clifford changed the way he went about coaching. He stopped taking the job home with him. He stopped watching as many games on TV after returning from one of his games. He limited his viewing of Magic game film. And he strategized sleeping in the same manner in which he would draw up a play with 20 seconds left in the game.  \u201cIt makes an enormous difference. My doctor said I would be going home but still coaching the team. That\u2019s one of the reasons for the headaches. Now, I may work a little at night but I watch movies or go out. \u201cI\u2019ll come in this (coach\u2019s room) and take naps, maybe a quick one. I sleep an hour and a half more at night. I feel great, I feel like I have a lot more energy. Getting seven hours every night, I find that very relaxing. I\u2019ve developed other interests. I\u2019ve gotten more in politics, which I took from Stan; I watch that at night. Not doing basketball, to have other things to think about, is more helpful.\u201d He began taking sleep enhancers and when his sleep time reached seven hours, he was allowed to return to coaching. After losing his job in Charlotte, Clifford had to reassure Jeff Weltman and John Hammond, the top basketball people with the Magic, that his condition was under control. After that, it was a rather easy call for the Magic. And so far, it\u2019s a good fit. After a dreadful stretch following the departure of Dwight Howard in 2012 where they\u2019ve never won more than 35 games a season or made the playoffs and appeared stuck in rebuilding, the Magic are showing life this season. At least they\u2019re not in the basement of the East, and own signature wins over Jimmy Butler and the Sixers, LeBron James and the Lakers and took games in Boston and San Antonio. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get better. We feel we can fight for the playoffs.\u201d That will depend on the development of Bamba and Orlando\u2019s top pick the previous year, Jonathan Isaac, in addition to the chance of Aaron Gordon rising to All-Star status. \u201cI\u2019m so fortunate it worked out,\u201d Clifford said, sounding like a man feeling blessed this Thanksgiving. \u201cIt definitely gives you perspective about a number of things, including how lucky we are to be involved in this. At this time in my life it\u2019s important for me to be involved in this league.\u201d With that, Clifford excused himself; he had to watch film, but it would take place in a spare office, not at home; and he\u2019d be leaving work in a few minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sticking to the game plan.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Making his first trip back to Cleveland since leaving for the second time as a free agent, James was welcomed like a hero on Wednesday night and rallied the Los Angeles Lakers to a 109-105 win over the Cavaliers, who played an inspired game against their former teammate but couldn\u2019t stop him when it mattered most. James finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. He also scored or assisted on 11 straight points as the Lakers overcame a 99-91 deficit in the fourth quarter. The Cavs had a chance to tie late, but Kyle Korver missed a wide-open 3-pointer with 17 seconds left and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made four free throws in the final 15 to seal it for Los Angeles. From the moment he stepped back onto Quicken Loans Arena floor, his home court for 11 seasons, James was treated like a returning champion. On the night before Thanksgiving, Cleveland said thanks to the Northeast Ohio son, the one who ended the city\u2019s 52-year championship drought. \u201cWe recognize the fact that certainly this is a big night for the city of Cleveland,\u201d Cavs coach Larry Drew said before tipoff, \u201cbecause a hero has come back.\u201d The Cavs, who came in an NBA-worst 2-13, didn\u2019t roll over against James and played one of their best games this season. They seemed in control up 99-91 before James, as he did some many times for Cleveland. Jordan Clarkson had 20 points and Tristan Thompson 14 and 15 rebounds for Cleveland. James was the last Lakers player introduced before the game, presented with a line familiar to all Cavs fans: \u201cA 6-foot-8 forward from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School,\u201d said arena announcer Sean Peebles. \u201cWelcome home! LeBron James.\u201d The crowd roared and stood as James walked out and huddled with his new teammates, who must have wondered what was in store for them. But unlike that ugly night of Dec. 2, 2010, when James returned with the Miami Heat and was subjected to non-stop booing, profane chants and a toxic, charged atmosphere of hatred unlike anything seen before or since, this was a night for celebration \u2014 and maybe more closure. James has moved on. Cleveland, too. With 8:09 left in the first quarter, James was saluted by the Cavs with a moving video tribute during a timeout. Images of James\u2019 playing days with Cleveland \u2014 highlighted by the Cavs\u2019 historic comeback to win the 2016 title \u2014 were shown along with video clips of his impact on the community, including his opening of the I Promise School in his hometown of Akron. As the crowd stood and showed its affection toward James, \u201cThank You LeBron\u201d was displayed in large letters on the arena\u2019s giant scoreboard. James appeared to be touched by the presentation. He bit his lower lip while walking back onto court and pointed to all corners of the building in appreciation, his chance to reconnect with a fan base he\u2019ll always share a special, if not complicated, relationship. Wearing a flat cap, long jacket and boots, James arrived at 5:46 p.m., entering the Q through a security entrance he\u2019s passed through many times. He greeted two guards near the door with fist bumps before quickly walking past a large group of photographers to the visitors\u2019 locker room. Earlier in the day, James visited his I Promise School, a refurbished elementary for at-risk kids he founded and plans to expand. James came back to Cleveland to face a team in disarray without him. The Cavs have endured a season\u2019s worth of issues in just over a month with the firing of coach Tyronn Lue, All-Star forward Kevin Love undergoing foot surgery and the latest drama \u2014 disillusioned forward J.R. Smith being excused so Cleveland can try to trade him. TIP-INS Lakers: Coach Luke Walton is impressed with James\u2019 knack for blocking out external distractions. \u201cThe great ones have that ability,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re on the basketball court nothing else matters, other than what they\u2019re trying to do. Their focus level seems to somehow get higher with the louder the noise gets. I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Cavaliers: Did not commit a turnover in the first half. \u2026 Starting G George Hill missed his sixth straight game with a sprained right shoulder sustained on Nov. 4. Hill has ramped up his on-court workouts in recent days and could be back soon. \u2026 Drew said he was unaware of Smith\u2019s comments accusing the Cavs of \u201ctanking.\u201d Drew believes his team is playing hard, and promised to nothing but coach his team to win. \u201cTo coach to lose, I don\u2019t understand that, I don\u2019t know how to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anybody can do that.

As for when the 7-foot German\u2019s record 21st season with the same franchise will begin after a longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery seven months ago, Nowitzki said the goal is sometime in December. The 13-time All-Star had surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle just before the end of the 2017-18 season. Nowitzki was on schedule to be ready for the start of this season before a setback led to tendon soreness just before the start of training camp in September. Nowitzki spoke alongside Rawlings before the ceremony during the Mavericks\u2019 game against Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard when I haven\u2019t done much for eight weeks and there\u2019s a 40-year-old basically starting from scratch to try to get back in shape to play NBA minutes,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cHopefully soon. Hopefully, somewhere in December I\u2019ll be ready and the body will respond the right way.\u201d Nowitzki is set to become the first player to spend all 21 seasons with the same team. Until he makes his debut, he will technically share the record of 20 seasons with Kobe Bryant, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2016. The 2007 NBA MVP said he started running on a treadmill about two weeks ago and has steadily increased the intensity. Nowitzki has played in a couple of games involving staff members during practice. But until he goes through several full practices, his debut will have to wait. \u201cThe reason why we\u2019re taking it so slow now is once I get out there, I want to finish the rest of the season healthy,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to come back too soon now and then have setbacks again like I did with the Achilles a few years ago. Next thing you know I missed another few weeks.\u201d Nowitzki said the significance of this debut hasn\u2019t made him any more anxious than the painstaking wait when all indications were the surgery wouldn\u2019t affect what could \u2014 and many presume will be \u2014 his final season. \u201cI\u2019ve been antsy,\u201d he said. \u201cHad the surgery in April and it\u2019s been nothing but rehab and treadmills. Love to step out there soon and get the kick of competing, the crowd involved. It\u2019s just something I miss. And once my career is over, that\u2019s for sure something I\u2019ll miss, the kick, the rush, the adrenaline.\u201d Nowitzki said he wasn\u2019t ready to decide how the injury will influence a decision on a possible 22nd season. Either way, Rawlings didn\u2019t want to wait past this season to honor the player who led the Mavericks to their only championship as the NBA Finals MVP in 2011 and is the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history with 31,187 points, seventh on the all-time list. Rawlings lauded Nowitzki for his willingness to be visible in public, mentioning that he was elected the same night Nowitzki was celebrating a birthday and they ended up at the same club. \u201cThat was LIT!\u201d Nowitzki interrupted, drawing laughs. \u201cA kid came here that was skinny and didn\u2019t really know much about life and only lived at home,\u201d Nowitzki said earlier. \u201cLike I said earlier, grew into a man here. Off the court, try to help out, try to help this great city be better. Try to represent the city the right way.\u201d"},{"id":37297,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-becomes-eighth-youngest-reach-10000-points","date":"2018-11-22","title":"Anthony Davis becomes eighth-youngest to reach 10,000 career points","content":"Anthony Davis crossed the 10,000-point plateau on an alley-oop from Jrue Holiday with 3:10 remaining in the second quarter of the Pelicans-Sixers game.

How \u2018bout 82, since that\u2019s what Portland pulled off last season? The Clippers are a lot of fun and a group that\u2019s easy to root for, especially in contrast to the star-driven expectations and impatience about the other NBA tenant at Staples Center. I\u2019m old school enough to hope that Memphis\u2019 counter-programming in pace and 3-point mania proves there still is more than one way to play in this league. But Portland\u2019s face-plant last spring ( getting swept by New Orleans ) after snagging the West\u2019s No. 3 seed is seared into the Blazers\u2019 collective psyche. To rebound from that and to fully honor their revered owner, the late Paul Allen, that high-intangibles team wants and needs to max out this season however it can. A high seed is the surest way to facilitate (not guarantee) playoff advancement, and leader Damian Lillard won\u2019t let himself or his mates take their eyes off that prize. Shaun Powell :  This usually leans toward strength of upcoming schedule, but let\u2019s go with the Blazers, who have the best player on either of the three teams \u2014 Damian Lillard \u2014 and obviously have learned a lesson from their first-round sweep last spring. of course, the Blazers can\u2019t prove anything until they return to the playoffs and prove they\u2019re built for at least the second round, but that\u2019s another story. John Schuhmann :  The Grizzlies have been the most pleasant surprise of the three, but it\u2019s tough to pick Memphis, despite their ability to stay in games with the league\u2019s second-ranked defense. They\u2019ve have played the easiest schedule of the three, with only seven of their 16 games against other teams that currently have winning records . That defense has benefited from playing more than twice as many games against bottom-10 offenses (7) as it has against top-10 offenses (3). The Grizzlies\u2019 record is slightly better (11-5) than their point differential says it should be (10-6), and they have the toughest schedule of the three between now and Game 40, with only 10 of their next 23 games at home and 17 of them against teams that currently have winning records. Of the three teams, the Clippers have played the toughest schedule so far and will have the easiest schedule between now and Game 40. But I\u2019ll stick with the Blazers, who are not only in first place in the West , but have the best record (7-2) in games played between the 16 teams that have winning records. They have some games with a rest disadvantage coming up (including Wednesday in Milwaukee), but after they visit the Bucks and Warriors this week, they\u2019ll play 16 of their next 24 games at home.  Sekou Smith :  The Trail Blazers have the right profile and should be the pick here. But the Clippers are a genuine surprise with the way they\u2019ve performed. And yet, I find myself rooting for the [former Hang Time] Grizzlies to maintain their position, if for no other reason than to do so would validate what I\u2019ve believed about Mike Conley and the impact he can have (when healthy) for a while now. Conley is one of the more underrated players at his (or any) position in a league stacked with point guard talent. Injuries have robbed him of the opportunity to show his best self the past couple of seasons. A Grizzlies team that stays in that top three mix in the Western Conference through 40 games would almost certainly need to have a healthy Conley running the show to accomplish such a feat."},{"id":37321,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-making-sense-markelle-fultz-troubles","date":"2018-11-21","title":"Blogtable: What do you make of Fultz's latest troubles?","content":"* * * What do you make of Markelle Fultz\u2019s latest troubles?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  I\u2019m feeling sad for Fultz, because this surely wasn\u2019t what he bargained for when he submitted his name for the 2017 Draft. He\u2019s already made more money than 99 percent of Americans will earn in their lifetimes, so it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about a dream turning into a relative nightmare, compounded by the trade that will forever have him compared to Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum, not to mention Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell and a half dozen other guys selected after Fultz. There seems to be some hardening of positions going on between the player and the Sixers now, who are eager for their contender train to go express. I hope I\u2019m wrong here, but it\u2019s hard to see a resolution or a chance at a happy ending for Fultz that doesn\u2019t include a relocation to and fresh start with another team. Shaun Powell :  A red flag, obviously, and proof that the Sixers still don\u2019t know what they have in this former No. 1 overall pick. The entire episode is perplexing, and there\u2019s little the team can do except see if he can work through his shoulder and the shooting stroke, which is broken. Never seen anything like it before in basketball. John Schuhmann :  From the outside, it\u2019s hard to know what exactly is wrong. And I wonder if Sixers GM Elton Brand, coach Brett Brown and Fultz\u2019s teammates really know. We thought that Fultz made progress with his trainer over the summer, but it became clear right away (in preseason) that he still had confidence issues with his jumper. Things have seemingly gotten worse since then and, though there are still five months left in the season, it\u2019s hard to see Fultz going from where he is now to being a postseason contributor on a team that has a goal of reaching The Finals.  Sekou Smith :  My sense is that Fultz and his representatives are doing whatever they can to solve his strange case of \u2014 whatever is going on with him \u2014 in an effort to salvage whatever is left of his career with the Sixers.  Remember, the current Sixers\u2019 front-office regime did not spend that No. 1 pick on him. So their trust and patience with Fultz might not be as air-tight as it would be otherwise. I can honestly say that I have never seen a case like this in basketball. Fultz is struggling in ways that simply defy logic. This isn\u2019t golf, tennis or even baseball, where a classic case of the yips is not uncommon. To see a young player with his raw talent and athleticism struggle like this is shocking. With Jimmy Butler joining Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons as the Philly superstar trio, I don\u2019t know what that does to Fultz. But it can\u2019t be a good thing."},{"id":37319,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-homecoming-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2018-11-21","title":"LeBron James' return to Cleveland highlights new era of former player tributes","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Lakers vs. Cavaliers (8 ET) He will feel and hear the love tonight and bathe in a level of warm comforts that no other visiting player has ever experienced in Cleveland before. LeBron James will get squeezed into the bosom of Cavs fans and greeted fabulously when he makes his first return as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, which means this isn\u2019t 2010 anymore. Almost eight years ago today, Cleveland also pulled out all the stops during a LeBron return visit \u2014 meaning, to protect him from potential violence. The mayor pleaded for calm. Security at Quicken Loans Arena was on high alert \u2014 LeBron was escorted by more bodyguards than usual \u2014 and for that game, beer was sold only in cups instead of plastic bottles. This was months after LeBron famously dumped Cleveland for the Miami Heat in free agency and, for many Cavs fans, that return date was circled in red, the color of blood. The reception was as hostile as expected: home-made signs scribbled with insults, chants of \u201cScot-tie Pip-pen\u201d \u2014 linking LeBron as Dwyane Wade\u2019s co-star \u2014 and an overall nasty atmosphere throughout the game in which LeBron was booed with every touch of the ball. LeBron incited the behavior at the start by performing his signature chalk-toss before tipoff, a gesture he previously reserved only for Cleveland. But here\u2019s what was more noticeable: after spending seven years with the Cavs, winning two Kia MVPs and taking a talent-starved team to The Finals in 2007 , LeBron didn\u2019t receive a video tribute that night, which has become standard in the NBA today for returning heroes. To put this into context: Zaza Pachulia was once feted on film by the Atlanta Hawks. Zaza! With free agency complicating the emotions of fans and front office officials, teams are often caught in a pickle when figuring how to salute the achievements of players who return in a different uniform. This is a phenomenon of the last decade or so; before that, there were no teary tributes or extended moments of applause or anything beyond a few claps during pre-game introductions. For example, it may shock people today to learn the Bulls did nothing special when Michael Jordan played his first game in Chicago as a member of the Washington Wizards in 2002. Even the pregame intros were muted. Jordan\u2019s name was announced over the PA with the same monotone used for other opposing players, although the Bulls did have the courtesy of delaying the intros of the home team while Jordan received a one-minute standing ovation at the United Center.  This would never happen today. Weeks of planning now go into constructing the most respectful way to recognize players making their returns, although again, these are taken on an individual basis and much depends on the circumstances that played a part of that player changing teams. Entering this season presented two interesting cases: Gordon Hayward in Utah and Kawhi Leonard in San Antonio. Both were beloved figures on their original teams and both left a bad taste when they left town, putting the Jazz and the Spurs in a tough spot. Hayward left in free agency two summers ago, opting to sign with the Boston Celtics for four years and $128 million. His Utah return was delayed while he spent essentially all of last season rehabbing from a leg injury. But Jazz fans were willing to stash their emotions until a few weeks ago when they greeted Hayward with what they felt he deserved: boos. Sensing the potentially awkward climate at Vivint Smart Arena well ahead of time, the Jazz made a 21-second, online-only Hayward tribute . Playing it in the arena would\u2019ve certainly caused headaches and howls. Hayward played seven solid years for the Jazz, made the All-Star team and created a follicle trend when some male fans rushed to get a \u201cHayward haircut.\u201d But none of that mattered two weeks ago and he heard a \u201c we don\u2019t miss you \u201d sing-song chant whenever he stood at the free throw line. \u201cI kind of expected some of that,\u201d he said. Leonard doesn\u2019t make his first and only appearance in San Antonio until Jan. 3 and it\u2019s not expected to be pretty. His quad injury, debated by armchair doctors everywhere, restricted him to nine games last season and kept him out of the playoffs, which he refused to attend. It greased his exit from the Spurs to the Toronto Raptors, where he\u2019s healthy again and playing at a Kia MVP-type level. In a loyal place like San Antonio, where David Robinson, Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan (among others) spent their entire careers, Kawhi will not feel the red carpet beneath his feet. And there\u2019s no word yet on how the organization will (or won\u2019t) honor him. Leonard was a Finals MVP and NBA champion in San Antonio, but the player he was traded for (DeMar DeRozan) never took the Raptors further than the Eastern Conference finals. Yet DeRozan will certainly get a standing ovation on Feb. 22 for his return to Toronto. These welcome-back events are all different and sometimes strange. Take DeMarcus Cousins, who was suspended multiple times by the Sacramento Kings and the league during his six-plus years there. He never took the Kings to the playoffs and showed little leadership skills (except off the court, where he gave his time freely in the local community) \u2026 and not only did Cousins get the video treatment, the fans stood and applauded loudly for him. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but love for (Sacramento),\u201d he said then. \u201cI came here as a kid and left as a man. As I\u2019ve stated many times, I\u2019ve got people here that I consider family. These fans have been great to me throughout the years, the love will always remain the same.\u201d Paul George was the core of a handful of very good Indiana Pacers teams that gave LeBron and the Heat all they could handle in the early 2010s. George carried himself with quiet dignity and he triumphantly returned from a broken leg. But he was booed last season when he returned with Oklahoma City. And a video of former Pacers greats aired during that game, which George wasn\u2019t included in (but Jeff Foster was). \u201cI knew what the atmosphere was going to be when I walked in there,\u201d George said. Kevin Durant was the greatest player in Oklahoma City Thunder history, yet two years later, he\u2019s still hearing hisses there \u2014 where, apparently, Midwestern hospitality only goes so far. Even Draymond Green didn\u2019t throw cupcakes at Durant in their locker room spat. When Dwight Howard returned to Orlando as a Laker, he did get the video treatment six years ago after he left the Magic in a huff and subsequently ruined the franchise in the process. But there\u2019s no evidence of Howard at Amway Center today. A photo collage on the wall outside the team locker room is conspicuously missing Howard (but does have Horace Grant). And of course, Isaiah Thomas\u2019 return became the gold standard of clumsiness. Thomas was caught in a bind involving a bigger hero in Boston, Paul Pierce, and a clash of tributes. Thomas had a splashy two-plus seasons with the Celtics when he developed a cult following, helped resurrect the franchise and nearly averaged 30 points for one season. Then he was hurt. Then he was traded, to Cleveland for Kyrie Irving. The Cavs made two trips to Boston last season but Thomas, who was injured for the first one, asked to have his video played on the next and last trip (\u201cIsaiah deserves it in our mind,\u201d said Celtics boss Danny Ainge). That conflicted with a long-planned retirement ceremony for Pierce, who bristled when asked if he\u2019d OK with a Thomas salute. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Isaiah shouldn\u2019t get a tribute video,\u201d Pierce said then. \u201cBut on February 11, the night I get my jersey retired, I\u2019m not sure I want to look up at the Jumbotron and see Isaiah highlights.\u201d Thomas respectfully asked to postpone his tribute and \u2026 he\u2019s still waiting. Now with the Denver Nuggets, Thomas is still recovering from the same hip injury. Denver doesn\u2019t visit Boston until March 18. Will he be healthy by then? Better yet, will anyone in Boston still remember? For sure, the angry reception given to LeBron eight years ago was a one-and-done thing for him. His subsequent trips to Cleveland as a member of the Heat were much tamer. His return to Miami after he boomeranged back to Cleveland was respectful and heartfelt. Given the title he won four years ago and his abundant charity work in Ohio, his visit to Cleveland tonight will be a complete 180 from the last one; expect to see the 2016 championship parade video on the big screen. \u201cI\u2019ll see some familiar faces like I did when I arrived (in Miami on Sunday),\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll think about some of the good, I\u2019ll think about some of the bad, I\u2019ll think about some of the great that I had with the franchise. And then once the tip ball gets going it\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d So with LeBron playing again in Cleveland for one night only, the conquering-hero-returns-home recurring story will get a fuzzy and warm flip of the page. This will do until Jimmy Butler returns to Minnesota. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

There should be none of the rancor that dominated his return with the Heat eight years ago, because any \u201cdebt\u201d James might have owed to Cleveland fans (stretching with that terminology, frankly) has been repaid in full, with interest. Eleven seasons? Five trips to the Finals, including four in a row? The city\u2019s first major sports championship since Jim Brown\u2019s NFL days? Approximately two dozen NBA franchises \u2013 and markets and fan bases \u2013 would be delighted and humbled by such a run courtesy of one future Hall of Famer. Anybody burning a LeBron Cavs jersey at this point should be doing so solely to make room in the closet for a Lakers edition. Shaun Powell :  The fans should applaud because it\u2019ll be one of the few chances for entertainment in The Q this season. This isn\u2019t 2010, when LeBron returned as Public Enemy No. 1. This time he\u2019s a certified Cleveland icon who raised a banner in the building and gave Cleveland a parade it\u2019ll never forget. John Schuhmann :  Like he delivered the city its first championship in 52 years. I can somewhat understand the vitriol of 2010, given how James handled his departure and, to a lesser extent, how he played in the least few games of the 2010 conference semifinals. But things are much different now. James led the Cavs to a title, he didn\u2019t make a TV special out of his decision to leave, and given how bad the Cavs are this season, his decision looks like a wise one. Well, that last part is the same as it was eight years ago.  Sekou Smith :  However they please. I\u2019d ask that they show him the proper respect and give him the ovation that he earned with all of those years of grinding for the hometown crowds. But who are we kidding? We know there is no way the entire crowd at Quicken Loans Arena follows the same routine. There will be so many emotions swirling around the building, given the state of the franchise and all of the adversity ahead. Showing LeBron some well-deserved love at this stage of the process might be a bit more than the masses can handle. LeBron knows that. He remembers 2010 and what kind of reception he got in his first game back in Cleveland in the opposing team\u2019s uniform. That said, I\u2019d love to see the look on his face if the crowd gave him a raucous standing ovation as he\u2019s introduced."},{"id":37322,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/markelle-fultz-shoulder-specialist-reports-philadelphia-76ers","date":"2018-11-21","title":"Reports: Markelle Fultz to visit shoulder specialist 'at direction of his attorney'","content":" Philadelphia 76ers guard Markelle Fultz will sit out all team practices and games until he receives an evaluation on his shoulder from a non-team specialist, according to reports from David Aldridge of The Athletic and Ian Begley of ESPN. Fultz is seeking the evaluation at the request of his agent and attorney, Raymond Brothers. The 20-year-old guard is expected to undergo the evaluation on Monday. \u201cThis news about his shoulder, it did catch me off guard,\u201d coach Brett Brown said on Tuesday. \u201cIf it\u2019s that real, and he needs to go see a further sort of consultation, then we support him.\u201d However, per Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer , Fultz took part in light shooting with the Sixers on Tuesday even after Brothers\u2019 said that wouldn\u2019t be the case going forward. Sixers general manager Elton Brand said Fultz\u2019s agent told him the guard wouldn\u2019t practice or play until the results of Monday\u2019s examination. Brand said he was told Monday was the earliest Fultz could see a specialist. Brand said he was unaware if anything was wrong with Fultz\u2019s shoulder. Fultz had said this month he wasn\u2019t bothered by the shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we saw medically that didn\u2019t allow him to play,\u201d Brand said. \u201cHe played last night. He played two nights ago. Ever since Jimmy Butler came and he wasn\u2019t starting, I felt he played pretty well. I was proud of the way he bounced back from a lot of things.\u201d Fultz has struggled with shoulder issues, which have affected his shot, since the Sixers drafted him in 2017. The former No. 1 pick played in just 14 games last season due to his shoulder situation and shot below 50 percent from the free-throw line. During training camp, Fultz said his shoulder was healthy and he was ready to return to the team after an offseason working with skills trainer Drew Hanlen. \u201cI put in a lot of hours this summer to get up reps of going through a whole bunch of different situations,\u201d Fultz said in September . \u201cSo coming in, I feel perfectly fine. I\u2019m confident.\u201d Despite his confidence, Fultz has continued to struggle this season with averages of 8.2 points (on 41.9 percent shooting), 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 22.5 minutes over 19 games . Fultz was the starting shooting guard for the first 15 games of the season before the Sixers acquired Jimmy Butler. Since the trade, J.J. Redick moved into the starting lineup and Fultz\u2019s playing time dwindled to a season-low of seven minutes against the Phoenix Suns on Monday . After the game, when questioned about his decision to turn to guard T.J. McConnell over Fultz during the second half, coach Brett Brown didn\u2019t commit to either player as his backup point guard. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Brown said after the Sixers\u2019 119-114 win . When would he know? \u201cJust when I think it through deeper and look at tape and see who we\u2019re playing, the next opponent, all those things I should do.\u201d Fultz was more candid about the situation and expressed willingness to work alongside McConnell. \u201cOur relationship is more than teammates,\u201d Fultz said after the game. \u201cWe both want to see each other do well, and we want to see the team win, so anytime one of us step on the court, we are probably rooting for each other more than most people. That\u2019s how it is. \u201cYou definitely want to go out there and compete \u2026 I\u2019m a competitor. But, at the end of the day, coach made a decision to do that, so I have to live with it. My mindset is just, when I step on the court, go out there and play. But while T.J. is out there, I\u2019m rooting for him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting on the bench pouting or anything. I want to be out there, but I\u2019m going to root for my teammates.\u201d The Sixers host the New Orleans Pelicans tonight ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass )."},{"id":37316,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-draymond-green-incident-free-agency","date":"2018-11-21","title":"Durant says incident with Green won't impact his free-agency decision","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Thunder vs. Warriors (10:30 ET) Kevin Durant says the recent in-game tiff he had with Golden State Warriors teammate Draymond Green won\u2019t have a bearing on his future with the team or his potential free agency in 2019. Green and Durant got into a much-publicized and discussed spat late in an eventual 121-116 overtime loss to the LA Clippers on Nov. 12. That dispute led to Green being suspended on game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team and to talk in some NBA circles that Durant was perhaps souring on staying with the Warriors long term. Durant holds a player option on his contract for next season, but he is widely expected to decline that and enter the free-agent market next summer. Durant, in an interview with Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes , says that the incident between he and Green won\u2019t play into what he decides in the future. \u201cNah, [it won\u2019t factor],\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports on Tuesday. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, I\u2019m just a ballplayer that\u2019s just trying to be in a great environment to play basketball and groom my skills every day. And I want to compete on a level that once the game starts, I\u2019m just totally comfortable with my surroundings, with just going out there and being me.\u201d \u201cI never really felt like it was a problem, because I know Dray and he says some crazy [expletive] out his mouth all the time,\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports. \u201cBut on top of that, it was just that there was so much coming with it from the outside, and so much stuff that we have to answer now.\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports that it did not take him long to put the entire incident with Green into its proper perspective. \u201cI was upset, but I know that I can\u2019t hold on to something like this,\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI know that I\u2019ve got to make a choice with myself, like how long are you going to be upset about this to the point where you\u2019re going to let it affect what you do on the floor or how you approach the game? Once it gets there now, I got to make a grown-man decision and tell myself, \u2018Look, man, no matter what, you still got to come to work every single day. It\u2019s going to work out. It\u2019s going to figure itself out.\u2019 And I think everyone\u2019s been handling it the best way they could and we\u2019re just trying to move forward with it.\u201d After serving his suspension during the Warriors\u2019 110-103 road win against the Atlanta Hawks on Nov. 13, Green returned to the lineup on Nov. 15 against the Houston Rockets. Before that game, Green went out of his way to explain his side of things with Durant and tried to mend fences with him as well. \u201cWhat happened a few nights ago, Kevin and I spoke. We\u2019re moving forward,\u201d Green said last Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret that I am an emotional player. I wear my emotions on my sleeve, I play with that same emotion. Sometimes they get the best of me and it doesn\u2019t work in my favor. I\u2019m going to live with that because it works in my favor to the good \u2014 as my resume speaks and this team\u2019s resume speaks \u2014 moreso than it doesn\u2019t. So, I\u2019m never going to change who I am. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about how \u2018is this the end of the run? Or \u2018Is it over?\u2019 Or \u2018did I force Kevin to leave?\u2019 \u2026 What you must know, nobody in this organization, from a player \u2014 not myself, not Kevin not anybody else \u2014 is going to beat us. If you\u2019re one of them 29 other teams in this league, you\u2019ve got to beat us. We\u2019re not going to beat us. We\u2019re going to continue to do what we do. I\u2019m sorry if that ruins everybody\u2019s stories.\u201d The Warriors have been in a slump since the incident in Los Angeles. They are 1-4 since Nov. 12 and have lost three straight games, although a large part of Golden State\u2019s woes can be attributed to the absence of injured star guard Stephen Curry . The former two-time Kia MVP winner has missed the Warriors\u2019 last six games with a left groin strain and is expected to be out throughout the weekend. Coach Steve Kerr told reporters on Tuesday that Curry will be re-evaluated on Saturday to further determine the timetable for his return. Durant echoed some of Green\u2019s sentiment in his interview with Yahoo Sports, saying that the rift could end up fueling the Warriors to another championship run. \u201cWhen you go through some adversity in your personal relationships and you kind of lay everything out on the table with that human, that person, you start to just really get an understanding for everything,\u201d Durant told Yahoo Sports. \u201c\u2026 I feel like we\u2019ll all do that at some point. Not just me and Draymond, but I feel like just being with these guys for so long that you start to get comfortable.\u201d It\u2019s been a rocky couple of weeks for Green. He hurt the toe against Memphis on Nov. 5, missed Golden State\u2019s next two games, returned for the game against the Clippers \u2014 the one where he had the dustup with Durant \u2014 and was suspended by the Warriors for their next game, against Atlanta on Wednesday. Green then played in Houston the next night, on a minutes restriction because of the toe, and went scoreless. The toe injury has sidelined Green for the last two games and he is not expected to play tonight against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Warriors GM Bob Myers and coach Steve Kerr have long supported Green\u2019s fiery nature that leads to technical fouls. Myers even sat with Green next door to Oracle Arena at the Oakland Coliseum when Green was suspended for a crucial Game 5 loss to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors wound up losing in seven. Green apologized after yelling at Kerr during halftime of a game at Oklahoma City in February 2016. \u201cMy feeling on Draymond and his impact on our team doesn\u2019t change. These things happen sometimes over the course of an NBA season,\u201d Kerr said Tuesday. \u201cWe deal with it \u2014 again, internally \u2014 so any conversations that are happening or have happened it\u2019s our business.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the first verbal altercation between Durant, the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP, and Green. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":37296,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-11-20-18","date":"2018-11-21","title":"About Last Night: Wizards turn it around","content":" Every NBA team struggles now and again. But the Washington Wizards, 5-11 coming into Tuesday night\u2019s home game with the Los Angeles Clippers after starting the season as a potential contender in the East, have been mired in mediocrity \u2014 or worse \u2014 since opening night. So poorly have they performed that talk has swirled in recent days about the franchise possibly trading one or both members of their All-Star backcourt tandem of John Wall and Bradley Beal. Maybe such speculation was beaten back last night, at least for a while, as Wall and Beal combined for 57 points and 15 assists to rally the Wizards from a 24-point deficit to defeat the Clippers 125-118 . LA\u2019s loss snapped a five-game winning streak. The first half was a microcosm of the Wizards\u2019 woeful early season, as poor communication and lack of effort on defense lead to a 40-21 score at the end of the first quarter. NBA TV analyst Kevin McHale said effort was the dramatic difference between the first and second half, as the Wizards overcame a 20-point deficit as late as the third quarter. Analyst Grant Hill pinned the successful rally on the awakening of Wall and Beal. \u201cThey showed their value, and they showed their heart.\u201d Green stamps his imprint  Raptors shooting guard Danny Green, acquired in the trade that sent Toronto fan favorite DeMar DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, paid a dividend last night.

The victory improved the Raptors to 14-4 with a 7-2 road record, both of which are tops in the East. Although he trailed Leonard, who scored 18 points, Green finished with 13.

(AP) \u2014 Stephanie Parker isn\u2019t quite sure how her family of six would have managed the last two months without the help of Michael Jordan and the American Red Cross following Hurricane Florence. So when Parker met Jordan on Tuesday she couldn\u2019t hold back giving the owner of the NBA\u2019s Charlotte Hornets a big hug and a thank you. \u201cIt means he hasn\u2019t forgotten,\u201d Parker told The Associated Press about Jordan\u2019s visit to Wilmington, North Carolina. \u201cIt means we are important.\u201d Jordan returned to his hometown wearing North Carolina Tar Heels blue and met with some hurricane victims, many of whom have benefited from his $2 million donation in September. Jordan gave $1 million each to the Red Cross and the Foundation for the Carolinas Hurricane Florence Response Fund. https:\/\/twitter.com\/hornets\/status\/1065023241574596610 \u201cI can give money all day long, but at some point you want them to understand you\u2019re human,\u201d Jordan told AP . Jordan handed out Thanksgiving dinners at a home improvement store and gave away Jordan Brand shoes at a Boys & Girls Club Tuesday where he once played as a child. Parker has lived the nightmare that\u2019s become all too familiar for hurricane victims around the country. She, her husband, and their four children ages 3 to 8 heeded the warnings to evacuate the area. They took refuge in a Red Cross shelter, but when they returned, their apartment was flooded with two feet of water and their minivan crushed by a fallen tree. They spent nearly two months in shelters until recently being placed in a hotel while they await permanent housing. \u201cIt\u2019s been stressful,\u201d she said, taking a long, deep breath. \u201cAt first it was really, really hard to realize that you lost everything. But people like Michael Jordan donating to the Red Cross and donating to people who have gone through what we\u2019ve gone through is an incredible blessing. We are so very, very thankful.\u201d Jordan broke into a wide smile when asked about his meeting with Parker. \u201cYou really want to trust that money goes to the right people,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd when you see it goes to the right people, it makes me feel good that I did the right thing.\u201d Jordan said he\u2019ll continue to monitor the hurricane recovery efforts and would consider partnering with others to continue to help improve living conditions. American Red Cross executive director James Jarvis, who is based out of Wilmington, said that the organization set aside a $50 million budget to help people affected by Hurricane Florence. Jarvis said at the height of the storm the Red Cross sheltered more than 20,000 people in 172 locations. They provided 1.3 million meals and snacks. They\u2019ve also distributed money to more than 6,500 families, doling out more than $3.8 million to help families get on the road to recovery. \u201cI wanted to be an igniter to the process,\u201d Jordan said of his initial donation. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take a long time before things get back to normal. Whatever way I can contribute I will.\u201d He also hopes that Charlotte hosting the All-Star game in February will provide an impetus for more financial aid to the region. \u201cI am pretty sure that the league will have some support systems that will reach out to this community,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd we are going to do a lot in Charlotte, too. But the overall game is about helping other people, so I can see it reaching all the way down to this area.\u201d Natalie English, the president and CEO of the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce, said it\u2019s still too early to estimate the financial damage to the area. But she said Jordan\u2019s donations resonated in the community. \u201cI think it means a lot to people here that Michael remembers his home and that he cares about where he was for his formative years and he is giving back to help restore the community,\u201d English said. This is not a one-time deal for Jordan. Fred Lynch coached Jordan when he was 15-year-old freshman playing on the junior high school basketball team at Laney High School in Wilmington. He sustained minor damage to his nearby home, but said several neighbors only a block away suffered total destruction as a result of flooding and wind damage to Hurricane Florence. Lynch said Jordan has visited Wilmington periodically since leaving to play college basketball at North Carolina and embarking on an NBA career that included six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, five league MVP honors and 14 All-Star game appearances. The 55-year-old Jordan still has an aunt, cousins and friends here and his nephew who attends college at UNC Wilmington. Jordan was most recently here in April at his high school filming a Gatorade commercial. Lynch said he wasn\u2019t surprised when Jordan stepped up to help the people of Wilmington and the surrounding areas \u2014 donating money and his time. \u201cFrom the time I coached him as a ninth grade, he was always looking out for people,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cHe\u2019s always trying to do the right thing and always trying to better himself and his community.

(AP) \u2014 USA Basketball has picked the 12 players who will compete in the next two-game round of qualifying for the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Most of the picks are coming from the G League \u2013 Joel Berry II, Reggie Hearn, Scotty Hopson, John Jenkins, DeAndre Liggins, Chasson Randle, Cameron Reynolds, Richard Solomon and Travis Trice. NBA free agents Eric Moreland, Jarnell Stokes and Tyler Zeller were also chosen for the roster. The U.S. is 7-1 so far in qualifying and has road games coming at Argentina (7-1) on Nov. 29 and Uruguay (5-3) on Dec. 2. Jeff Van Gundy is coaching the Americans in qualifying. If the U.S. qualifies for China, the national team coached by Gregg Popovich and loaded with NBA all-stars would play in that event. There are scenarios where the U.S. could clinch a spot for next year\u2019s World Cup in China during this two-game window. Otherwise, the Americans\u2019 fate could be decided by outcomes of games in Greensboro, North Carolina next February against Panama (Feb. 22) and Argentina (Feb. 25). And the U.S.-Argentina game next week could be huge. The U.S. and Argentina are tied atop Group E with 7-1 records and will play with outright control of first place in the group standings up for grabs. Uruguay and Puerto Rico will meet that same day, each entering with 5-3 records, meaning the loser there will be three games behind the U.S.-Argentina winner with three games left in qualifying. The top three teams in the group standings are guaranteed spots in the World Cup. Qualifying started late last year, and it\u2019s been broken up into a series of two-game windows. FIBA changed the qualifying rules for this tournament, and because most of the games have overlapped with the NBA season the Americans had no choice but to ask G League players to earn the country\u2019s spot in the World Cup \u2013 even though a chance to play in China won\u2019t be the reward for any of those players. This is the fifth of those qualifying windows, and Van Gundy is getting basically a fifth different roster. He\u2019s used 37 players already in the qualifying games, and nine of the 12 players he\u2019s taking to South America on this trip has yet to appear in any of the eight previous qualifier contests.

Fultz played just 14 games last season because of a shoulder injury that seems to have affected his shooting mechanics and made him one of the more scrutinized players in the NBA. Fultz lost his starting spot in the rotation when the Sixers traded for Jimmy Butler.

Brand said he was told Monday was the earliest Fultz could see a specialist. Brand said he was unaware if anything was wrong with Fultz\u2019s shoulder. Fultz had said this month he wasn\u2019t bothered by the shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we saw medically that didn\u2019t allow him to play,\u201d Brand said. \u201cHe played last night. He played two nights ago. Ever since Jimmy Butler came and he wasn\u2019t starting, I felt he played pretty well. I was proud of the way he bounced back from a lot of things.\u201d The 20-year-old Fultz is averaging 8.2 points, 3.1 assists, 3.7 rebounds and shooting 42 percent from the field. \u201cWe just want the best for him,\u201d Brand said. The Sixers are 9-0 at home and in fourth place overall in the Eastern Conference."},{"id":37294,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-jr-smith-parting-ways","date":"2018-11-20","title":"J.R. Smith parting ways with Cleveland Cavaliers","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 J.R. Smith\u2019s bumpy-but-never-boring stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers is over. The team said Tuesday that the disgruntled forward , who had requested to be traded earlier this season, \u201cwill no longer be with team as the organization works with JR and his representation regarding his future.\u201d The Cavaliers will try to trade Smith. He will make $14.7 million this season, and $3.8 million of his $15.6 million salary for next season is guaranteed. For now, the 33-year-old Smith is without a team and that seems to suit him just fine. He has been dismayed with his reduced role as the Cavaliers rebuild in their first season since LeBron James left for the second time as a free agent. Smith\u2019s unhappiness had created another distraction in a stormy season for Cleveland, which is a league-worst 2-13 and has been blown out numerous times. The Cavaliers fired coach Tyronn Lue last month following a 0-6 start, and the team has been riddled with injuries, the most prominent to All-Star forward Kevin Love, who remains out indefinitely following foot surgery. Smith\u2019s departure comes a day before James makes his return to Cleveland for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers. Smith came to the Cavaliers in a trade from the New York Knicks in 2015. While his play has been inconsistent, he was a major contributor on Cleveland\u2019s 2016 championship team. He made two 3-pointers early in the second half of Game 7 as the Cavaliers rallied to win and become the first team in league history to overcome a 3-1 series deficit. With Smith gone, the Cavaliers have just three players \u2013 Love, Tristan Thompson and Channing Frye \u2013 left from their title team. Before the Cavs won the championship, Smith already had become a favorite with Cleveland fans. He seemed to endear himself further to many by remaining shirtless during the team\u2019s victory parade through the city\u2019s streets. However, Smith\u2019s support eroded some during last year\u2019s Finals when he lost track of the score in Game 1 and dribbled out the final seconds of regulation, depriving the Cavaliers a chance to steal a win. Cleveland wound up losing in overtime and got swept by the Warriors. Smith is averaging a career-low 6.7 points this season. He has averaged 10.3 points in 255 games with Cleveland over the past five seasons."},{"id":46726,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jr-smith-steps-away-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2018-11-20","title":"Smith steps away from Cavs as he awaits trade","content":" JR Smith\u2019s time with the Cleveland Cavaliers has come to an end, the team announced on Tuesday . \u201cJR Smith will no longer be with team as the organization works with JR and his representation regarding his future,\u201d the team said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe organization wishes JR and his family well and appreciates and thanks him for his contributions in the community, to the team and his role in the 2016 NBA Championship.\u201d Smith reportedly will work out away from the Cavaliers as he waits for them to facilitate the trade request he made in early November. According to Joe Vardon of The Athletic, Smith and the Cavaliers aren\u2019t negotiating a contract buyout because Smith says he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant his legacy to be remembered like that.\u201d The 33-year-old guard has been frustrated with his playing time on a team he says is not focused on winning this season. \u201cI don\u2019t think the goal is to win,\u201d Smith told Vardon on Monday . \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to go out there and try to get as many wins as you can. I think the goal is to develop and lose to get lottery picks. I think that was always the plan.\u201d Smith, along with other Cavaliers veterans, reportedly entered this season under the belief the Cavaliers would try to compete in the East after the departure of LeBron James. But it quickly became clear that wasn\u2019t going to be the case. Here\u2019s more from Vardon on the situation : The Cavaliers fired coach Tyronn Lue after just seven games this season and replaced him with Larry Drew. The team currently sits in last place in the Eastern Conference with an NBA-worst record of 2-13. Smith was a key contributor for the Cavaliers during the past three-plus seasons. Alongside James, Smith and the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals in four straight seasons from 2015 to 2018 and won the 2016 NBA championship. Smith averaged 8.3 points on 40.3 percent shooting in 28.1 minutes over 80 games last season ."},{"id":37347,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwyane-wade-action-after-birth-child","date":"2018-11-20","title":"Dwyane Wade returns to Miami Heat after birth of child","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Dwyane Wade is back with the Miami Heat after missing nearly two weeks for the birth of his daughter. Wade went through Miami\u2019s gameday shootaround and will play Tuesday night against the Brooklyn Nets ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). He said his wife and their daughter are doing well, which allowed him to feel comfortable to resume his season. \u201cI\u2019m going to obviously miss them,\u201d Wade said. \u201cIt was tough leaving my little girl and my wife, but I\u2019ve got to get back to work and I\u2019ll see them again soon.\u201d Wade was away from the team for about two weeks because of the birth of his daughter. Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union-Wade welcomed Kaavia James Union Wade into the world on Nov. 7. Wade had been in Los Angeles with them since then, and flew back to Miami on Monday. His return is most certainly welcome in Miami. The Heat went 2-5 in his time away, falling to 6-10 this season. They\u2019ll play Tuesday without guards Goran Dragic (knee), Tyler Johnson (hamstring) and Dion Waiters (ankle recovery from last season). \u201cThere\u2019s a human element to this business and to the game and it is the most important thing,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cThe connection, your spirit, your emotions, everybody getting on the same page, and just seeing Dwyane back here with the guys there was a tangible boost in the energy today in the shootaround.\u201d Wade is Miami\u2019s third-leading scorer this season at 14.3 points per game. He was in his best stretch of the season when he got the call that his daughter was coming a few weeks earlier than planned. He said he felt the frustration level his team was going through during their current slide, and he tried to keep in touch via texts and phone calls. Wade kept up conditioning while in Los Angeles, but knows it\u2019ll take a little time to get back to the level of a few weeks ago. \u201cI was so excited for my daughter to come, but I was like, \u2018Baby, you know, your dad was playing in a rhythm. You could have waited a little while,'\u201d Wade said. \u201cI was just getting my legs under me, but great things happened to make me miss time, and now I\u2019m back.\u201d The baby was born via a surrogate, which is one of the reasons why Wade felt taking a brief paternity leave was necessary. Parents of surrogate-carried babies are told the first few days after the birth are critical to forging deep bonds with their child. Lots of skin-to-skin contact and talking to the baby helps with the bonding. So Wade needed time, and the Heat supported the plan. \u201cSo much of this league is mood of the team and confidence,\u201d Heat guard Josh Richardson said. \u201cWith him back, we\u2019re definitely a lot more confident moving forward.\u201d Union-Wade \u2013 who revealed she had nine miscarriages in her 2017 book \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Need More Wine\u201d \u2013 has taken time off work to bond with the new arrival. She\u2019s been filming an upcoming project in Los Angeles, and when she\u2019s back on the set, Kaavia James will be close by. \u201cShe was working right up until we got the call,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWhen she goes back, my daughter will be going back to the set with her. Her trailer is fit for everything, the baby\u2019s safety, everything. So our baby will be there with her when she\u2019s at work.\u201d Wade strongly considered retirement during the offseason because of the baby\u2019s arrival, not making the decision to return until just before training camp in September. He questioned whether it was fair to his wife and their family to still be playing and traveling while raising a baby. He also wondered if he could handle being away from his daughter for long stretches. \u201cWe went through a lot to get here,\u201d Wade said. \u201cMy family had to come first right now.\u201d"},{"id":37367,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-11-19-18","date":"2018-11-20","title":"About Last Night: Kemba Walker's encore","content":" \u201cThis is my (stuff)!\u201d Such was Kemba Walker\u2019s exultation to a euphoric home crowd after finishing off the Celtics on Monday, with his ridiculous, step-back 3-pointer giving the Hornets an insurmountable lead in the final minute en route to a 117-112 victory . The coup de grace gave Walker 21 points in the fourth quarter and 43 overall, a historic encore following his career-high 60 points against the Sixers on Saturday. With the outburst, Walker joined five others \u2014 all Hall of Famers \u2014 to score at least 40 immediately after going for 60-plus. It\u2019s rare air for a player who was viewed not so long ago as, if not a bust, then a definite disappointment after his selection ahead of the likes of Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Klay Thompson at No. 9 in the 2011 draft. Walker now sits atop the league scoring list, just ahead of Warriors star Stephen Curry at 29.6 points per game, the most gaudy portion in what is shaping up to be by far the best season of his career. A third straight All-Star nod seems like a mortal lock, as is a massive free-agent contract this summer. If the Hornets can improve on their mediocre 8-8 record, the former UConn star might even find himself as a fringe candidate for Kia MVP. Hold the vote now, and Celtics coach Brad Stevens just might give it to him. \u201cYou can\u2019t go under screens, you can\u2019t give him free throws, you can\u2019t waste bonus fouls,\u201d said Stevens, whose team was powerless to slow Walker despite entering with the league\u2019s top-ranked defense. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose him in pick and rolls. You name it, everything has to be good. He\u2019s using so many of their possessions and he\u2019s doing it at such an efficient rate.\u201d It\u2019s been a trying season for the Wizards. A playoff team in four of the past five seasons, with three of those appearances resulting in rare series victories, they\u2019re currently languishing near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings at 5-11. It got even worse on Monday, as hints of dysfunction and frustration throughout their poor start boiled over with multiple reports of a recent practice in which franchise cornerstone John Wall allegedly cursed at head coach Scott Brooks for intervening in his dispute with teammate Jeff Green.  ESPN reported that Wall was fined despite apologizing to Brooks shortly after the incident. The Washington Post additionally reported that Bradley Beal and Austin Rivers also got into it at the same workout, with Beal taking a pointed shot at long-time general manager Ernie Grunfeld in the process. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Wizards followed that Thursday practice with double-digit home losses to the Nets and Blazers, with Brooks describing the latter as \u201cembarrassing.\u201d \u201cWe got to just play with more enthusiasm, more effort, more energy,\u201d he said. More everything, pretty much, or yet another ESPN report that the Wizards are open to trading pretty much anyone on the roster could come to fruition. Taking a cue from their trash-talking center, the Sixers took a friendly (we think) shot at Suns rookie Deandre Ayton following their 119-114 victory . The details: Ayton drew a picture of himself dunking on the aforementioned trash-talker, Sixers All-Star Joel Embiid, during Panini\u2019s rookie photo shoot. Ayton promptly threw one down over Embiid in the opening minutes, presenting the Suns\u2019 social media team with an opportunity it couldn\u2019t resist. But as the old saying goes, discretion is the better part of valor. Embiid ended up dominating the matchup, roughly doubling up Ayton in points (33-17) and rebounds (17-9), which the Sixers were only too happy to celebrate. As great as Embiid was against the Suns, he still had at least one moment to forget. Not that teammate Ben Simmons was going to let him. If there\u2019s been one constant during Gregg Popovich\u2019s tenure in San Antonio, it\u2019s stifling defense. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case in New Orleans, however, as the Pelicans shredded them for a staggering 140 points \u2014 the most they\u2019ve have ever allowed in 1,754 games under Popovich. The Pelicans shot 57.8 percent with 34 assists as four different players scored 21 or more. One of those players, Julius Randle, became the fourth player to record a triple-double in 25 minutes or less. At least Pop had a sense of humor about it: \u201cWe held them to 140. What do you mean they\u2019re hard to guard?\u201d Hawks rookie Trae Young has had his struggles, entering Monday\u2019s action shooting just 24.2 percent on 3s while averaging 3.9 turnovers per game. That hasn\u2019t stopped him from putting up some monster individual performances so far. Despite another rough shooting night, Young joined some rare \u2014 and elite \u2014 company with 25 points and 17 assists against the Clippers.

To them, he has a message. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Curry said. Curry spoke publicly Saturday night for the first time about the testy exchange between Durant and Green \u2014 they went at each other late in what became an overtime loss to the LA Clippers last Monday night, and the fallout has been a major talking point around the NBA since \u2014 and lauded both players for the way they\u2019re handing the situation. \u201cI think the way we\u2019ve handled it as a team, the way Draymond\u2019s handled it, the way KD\u2019s handled it, it\u2019s been nothing but professionalism,\u201d Curry said. Green is getting the weekend off. The Warriors held him out of their game in Dallas on Saturday because of an ongoing issue with a toe on his right foot, a game Golden State lost 112-109 . He also did not play as Golden State lost 104-92 on the road to the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday. To coach Steve Kerr, the difficult times the Warriors have faced of late show just how fortunate the team has been overall the last few seasons. In racking up back-to-back NBA titles and three championships in the last four seasons, Golden State has made life in the NBA look simple at times. \u201cWe\u2019ve had such a charmed existence the last four seasons. So, of course, this is the toughest stretch we\u2019ve been in,\u201d Kerr said after Sunday\u2019s loss to San Antonio. \u201dThis is the real NBA. We haven\u2019t been in the real NBA the last few years. We\u2019ve been in this dream. So, now we\u2019re faced with real adversity. We\u2019ve got to get out of it ourselves.\u201d Curry and Green went down with injuries during the recent dry spell, but the biggest setback was self-inflicted. Green and Durant had a blowup at the close of regulation in a 121-116 overtime loss to the LA Clippers last Monday. Green\u2019s tirades on the bench and in the postgame locker room led the team to hand the seventh-year forward a one-game suspension. The flare-up and the Warriors\u2019 inability to move past it spiritually has confounded Kerr. \u201cJust play with joy. It\u2019s always been about just our emotion,\u201d Durant said, describing how Kerr has encouraged his club. \u201cHe\u2019s always been big about that. He\u2019s just trying to get that joy back.\u201d There wasn\u2019t much joy to be found in San Antonio. DeMar DeRozan had 20 points and nine assists and Rudy Gay added 19 points to help the Spurs snap a three-game slide. Golden State was without Curry and Green again, and their absence led to a cold start. Three nights after being held to a season-low output in a 107-86 loss at Houston, the Warriors nearly matched that dubious mark. They missed all six 3-point attempts in the first quarter as San Antonio jumped out to a 33-27 lead. The Spurs\u2019 Rudy Gay scored 12 points in the opening period. San Antonio also frustrated the Warriors on offense for much of the game. After quickly regaining an errant pass on their end of the court in the third quarter, Durant passed up a 3-pointer to fire a pass in the lane to Damian Jones only to have Gay stuff him at the rim. It\u2019s been a rocky couple of weeks for Green. He hurt the toe against Memphis on Nov. 5, missed Golden State\u2019s next two games, returned for the game against the Clippers \u2014 the one where he had the dustup with Durant \u2014 and was suspended by the Warriors for their next game, against Atlanta on Wednesday. Green then played in Houston the next night, on a minutes restriction because of the toe, and went scoreless. \u201cWe decided to give him some time off,\u201d Kerr said Saturday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long it will be, but the toe has been lingering, the injury has been lingering. He felt and we felt and our training staff felt that we\u2019re spinning our wheels a little bit if we keep playing him. We\u2019ve got to get him better.\u201d Curry missed his sixth straight game on Sunday with a strained left groin, and is likely to miss at least another week before he\u2019s cleared to return. He wasn\u2019t in Los Angeles for the Clippers game. \u201cIt\u2019s been different. It\u2019s been tough,\u201d Curry said Saturday. \u201cObviously it sucks not being able to play, sucks when you\u2019re not with the team and something like that happens.\u201d Curry was asked why he thinks Durant and Green will reconcile. \u201cThey have a lot of equity built in their relationship,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThey\u2019ve won championships together. They\u2019ve brought out the best in each other. Obviously, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had an incident to this level, but you don\u2019t have the experiences that you\u2019ve had and go through the journey that we\u2019ve been on and let it be derailed by something like that.\u201d The Warriors are trying this season to join only the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls as franchises to win three consecutive NBA titles . Curry said that will be foremost in the Warriors\u2019 collective thoughts going forward. \u201cWe have the opportunity to do something extremely special this year,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be ups and downs and bumps in the road, whether it\u2019s self-inflicted or whether it\u2019s from outside.

McCutchen, whose fashion sense rivaled anyone entering the arena on game nights during his officiating career, spent last season getting adjusted to his new role. Now he\u2019s fully immersed in in a role it seemed he was destined for. He recently spoke to NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith: Sekou Smith:  The transition, after all those years being no the court and in the middle of the action, what\u2019s that like seeing the game from your current vantage point? Monty McCutchen:  First of all, it\u2019s clearly been a transition. When you change your life dramatically, there are culture changes you have to go through, there\u2019s culture shock you have to go through. The good thing about it is the work I find important. And I\u2019m always a little hesitant to talk about how I view the work because I don\u2019t want to seem preachy or you know, \u2018it\u2019s just refereeing dude. Don\u2019t get carried away.\u2019 And I think there is some truth to that, it is just refereeing. But I do think refereeing exhibits some of the greater things in life. When it\u2019s done well, and done with integrity and character and with a sense of fairness, I\u2019ve found it to be very analogous to what leading a good life is about. Treating people well, standing up for yourself, standing up for principles higher than yourself. And I think when all of those things get put into play, a good referee really is a person who is capable of building good bridges. I know that might not seem like the case when you\u2019re giving technical fouls out and things like that. But when it\u2019s done really well it\u2019s about building such good relationships that they trust you and you trust them, even amongst a disagreement. And that\u2019s prideful to me to have left one area where you can do that individually, to hopefully then come over to another side of the same coin and have, at least in your hopes, that same kind of impact on those important, bigger than ourselves events, thought processes and philosophies on other people. SS:  That sounds like some serious team-building strategy that is being employed at the executive level, I\u2019m assuming in an effort to shape the culture of the program from top to bottom. MM:  I\u2019m really proud of the people I\u2019m working with. Todd DeMoss, Jonathan Kolb and Bethany Donaphin in the WNBA. On the NBA side we have obviously [Senior Vice President and head of referee operations] Michelle D. Johnson. But I also get to work with Shareef Abdur-Rahim, John Zisa, Matt Futterman, Joe Liebskind, Jake Mendys, Chris Goodyear and all of these people in the office who, in my opinion, are full of all of the good things in life. And, of course, I get to continue working with people who were mentors to me. Guys like Mark Wunderlich, Joey Crawford, Bennett Salvatore, Bernie Fryer, Eddie F. Rush, and we do have a real good team in place in which we are trying to pull in the direction of those higher principles. Now we have to get plays right \u2014 that\u2019s the reality of it \u2014 but within getting the plays right, you do that because your mind is right. And that means your mind is in the right place. It\u2019s not about you being a NBA referee. It\u2019s about serving the game that you love. And I think from this new vantage point, it\u2019s somewhat easier to see if those valuable skills and ideals, if you will, have a real place in the NBA. To be on the daily frontline of implementing those ideals is incredibly rewarding and I\u2019ve enjoyed that transition. SS:  That\u2019s not an easy move to make after all that time. Surely there had to be some serious deliberation about diving into that space. MM:  Yes, it\u2019s been difficult at times. At my age, at 52, there\u2019s a real sense of getting set in your ways. I used to laugh at my dad when he would tell me that and then I feel it happening to me. I believe certain things and to change that and to immediately have to go and learn new skills is both invigorating and, at times, quite frightening. SS:  Where you\u2019ve been a game official for 25 years and start as long ago as you did, to see the technology go from where it did to where it is now has to be that frightening part you talked about. The analytics used and applied today has to be beyond your wildest dreams as a young official just starting out all those years ago? MM:  You know, like any industry that is in the midst of a sea change, you have to have a real strong balance of taking from the past what continues to work while shedding dead weight, if you will, and adding the innovation that helps make things easier and better. I\u2019ll go back to the central theme of what an official is: he serves the game. And technology serves the game, so you have to be able to adapt. What\u2019s the old evolutionary saying we all learned as kids? Adapt or die. Refereeing is no different. I go back to it though, the key anything you come across new things you have to marry the new with the old to get the best result, because there are great principles that Mendy Rudolph handed down to Joe Gushue who handed down to Joey Crawford who handed down to Scott Foster. That lineage, that knowledge, one of the things we\u2019re trying to instill in our culture since we\u2019ve taken over, is that all of those people I just mentioned are you. You\u2019re going to be a link to someone younger, even if you\u2019re young now, there\u2019s a link. We just hired five new people and my job, in this role, and it\u2019s also the job of Marc Davis, [Mike] Callahan, Ed Molloy and Zach Zarba, that if I handed something down to them, to hand it down to those officials we just hired. The link in the chain of our history is as vital as the technological advances we\u2019ve seen. SS:  That\u2019s the marriage of the old and new you\u2019re talking about? MM:  Absolutely. The analytics, as everyone has seen, has played a big role in shaping the way we do things now. Tape has evolved from where we were carrying around portable VHS machines on the road, from the JVC that I bought when I first came into the league, to now guys can carry around a hard drive no bigger than an iPhone and you can store a season\u2019s worth of games on that device. Embracing that allows for more instant feedback. We\u2019re looking at virtual technology and where that can be helpful. Right now I think it\u2019s more helpful outward facing, so you can see what referees are seeing and dealing with, what they are faced with in those bang-bang situations and how you have to respond. But we\u2019re hopeful that it continues to grow to the point that it becomes a viable training method. There is talk of how the Replay Center will be innovated. And I don\u2019t know how often any of this will come to pass. Could there be chips put in balls to help with goaltending and out of bounds situations? These are all things that are not a part of our reality right now but could one day become a reality to help serve the game. Ultimately, technology is only as good as the people that use it and what they use it for. So from that standpoint we want to make sure the technology has as its base, the same thing Joe Gushue had, which is does it serve the game? What puts the players and the coaches in the best environment so that their talents, hard work and schemes can be held up against competition so that they can find out if more work is needed or if it has all paid off. SS:  There was a point last season where it was clear that the working dynamic between the players and coaches and game officials was off track. And then there was the announcement that there would be a closed-door summit during All-Star weekend where you all could air everything out. It seemed like the temperature went down tremendously after that. Was it as significant a turning point as it seems, given the way things have transpired since then? MM:  We\u2019re hopeful that the good vibes continue. And listen, we\u2019re are aware we have the best, most passionate players and coaches in our league. We have passionate referees that want to do the work of upholding the standards that the league provides. And I think that when you have those two, sort of diametrically opposed goals sometimes, one about winning and one about holding up standards, there\u2019s going to be some conflict. I don\u2019t think any of us are under the illusion that we won\u2019t have some conflict. In fact, I\u2019d be disappointed if we didn\u2019t. And not because I like conflict. But I do love passion. And the passion our players and coaches display on a nightly basis is what our fans tap into to say, \u2018this matters.\u2019 And if I\u2019m going to invest my time and energy into a franchise and its well-being, it\u2019s wonderful to see the players and coaches invest their energy and passion in an outward facing way to want to win for a city and a franchise. So I don\u2019t ever want to that passion to leave. SS:  But it\u2019s clearly something you all have studied and addressed as a staff, that delicate relationship between the principles involved on the court every night? MM:  One of the things I\u2019ve been harping on since Michelle and I came in, and that\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t harped on before. Because I think we\u2019re always building on things the other people were in these position before is worked on. Bob Delaney and Mike Bantom and the people who have held these positions before worked hard at it and in a lot of instances we\u2019re following up on some of those same things. Quite frankly, I\u2019m not going to be in this position forever, I know that. There will be someone after me. And understanding that means that you try to implement things that can outlast you. And one of the things that I want to outlast me as a cultural imprint on refereeing is that refereeing is sort of equal parts what happens when you blow your whistle, that\u2019s the action part of the game. But it\u2019s also equal parts what do you do after you blow the whistle. Can you communicate your perspective clearly without arrogance? Can you show courage and strength without arrogance? Can you show humility without just getting run over by weakness? And I think that those balance points bring us to better communication. And we\u2019ve been harping on communication. And better communication, Sekou, isn\u2019t just sitting there taking it while someone sits there yelling at you and somehow you\u2019re a great communicator because you didn\u2019t give him a technical foul. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s certainly not what I\u2019m talking about. Good communicators can divert, listen, give perspectives that give pause for a player\u2019s perspective to where they now understand a separate perspective because it was shared not only from a good place of energy but a good place of knowledge. And we\u2019ve really harped on sharing perspectives. You don\u2019t call a foul because it\u2019s a foul and I said it\u2019s a foul. No. When you\u2019re asked about it, it\u2019s a foul because we\u2019re upholding the standard and here is the standard, you\u2019re not allowed to put two hands on a person in the post when they have the ball. So, there\u2019s no judgement in my hands on that call. SS:  Is getting to that point of a discussion the critical part, where it\u2019s a conversation as opposed to guys in an extremely competitive and emotional, pressure-packed environment going off \u2014 often times on each other? MM:  Sure. There are times when our job is to help everyone get through certain moments in the midst of that action, team-related or whatever it is. But by the same token, sometimes players help us get through our own emotions. I\u2019ve had player say, \u2018hey Monty, I\u2019m just asking a question.\u2019 And I have to check myself because of my own competitive nature to be good at my work. And so I think when you build good relationships everyone is in that moment with the understanding that this isn\u2019t personal, we\u2019re all trying to get our work done. So I think there are always these little points. But we are harping on the fact that good communication is this balance between courage without arrogance, strength without arrogance and humility without weakness. SS:  One last thing, on the hiring of these five new officials. How important is it to have the highest bar for your officials that you bring into the league, knowing that they\u2019re going to be names and faces associated with the game for eternity? Don\u2019t you have to get that part right in order to live up to the ideals you\u2019re speaking of? MM:  There\u2019s the real weight of that that I feel. One of the things that you start to recognize is that if you\u2019re talking about building a culture on those higher ideals, then you have to find the people who possess those kind of commitments to higher principles, as well as people who are capable of doing the work at hand, in real time at fast speeds. And that combination is rare. So getting those five people right is vital. As we meld and align all three of our leagues [NBA, WNBA, NBA G League] into one vision of a culture for refereeing, you have to be mindful of all those things. We have a good vetting process. We have a scouting team that looks at over 3,000 officials a year. And then, out of that, the top 90 are invited to a grassroots camp. From the grassroots we go to a mid-level camp where there is another vetting process from 90 to 45 and then from 45 to 28 or so to an elite camp. And from out of there we hire the best candidates every year. This year it was 12, there\u2019s no set number because that\u2019s usually dependent on what we need for the G League and whatnot. So, we have a really strong vetting process. And not only do we get to see them work through all those various depots and stopping points, we also get to interact with them at all of those stopping points. We find out about who they are as people in all of those starting and stopping points. And then from the G League, probably only one out of five make it to the NBA from there. We have a really stringent program. Now, the NBA is a different beast. When you get here and you\u2019re under the lights and under the scrutiny we\u2019ve been talking about, not every person rises to that challenge over the years. Most do. We have a very strong success rate with who we bring to the NBA and we\u2019re proud of that. And for me and Michelle and our part in that, you definitely feel the weight of it all. I\u2019m proud of this class. They\u2019ve put in good work. They\u2019ve bought into the cultural markers we\u2019re trying to establish. I\u2019m excited for their futures and how those futures impact the NBA. And I\u2019d be remiss if if I didn\u2019t say, we\u2019re committed to finding the best. It\u2019s time to challenge what packages the best come in. And our sense of diversity mirrors our cultural beliefs that good refereeing about your heart, your grit, it\u2019s about your character and the integrity you possess. And that can come from different genders, that can come from different countries and that can come from different races. What is common, though, is the ideals that we\u2019re talking about. If you possess those, I don\u2019t care if you are 5-foot-4 or 6-foot-4. I care about the fact that you\u2019re going to apply fairness and integrity and character to NBA basketball. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

With the Western Conference having had a better record than the East in interconference games in 18 of the previous 19 seasons, the best player in the world was going from weaker conference to the stronger one. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, the West has been dominant thus far this season, having won 49 of the 74 interconference games through Sunday. After a 31-22 start, the West has won 18 of its last 21 games against the East and is on pace for 298 interconference wins, 32 more than its had in any of the last 20 seasons. It helps that the two West teams that have played the most games against the East are the Golden State Warriors (6-1) and Portland Trail Blazers (5-2), who are a combined 11-3 against the other conference. The two East teams that have played the most games against the West are the Brooklyn Nets (2-6) and Washington Wizards (1-7), so things haven\u2019t exactly been even in that regard. Still, the imbalance has 10 West teams and only seven East teams with winning records. Six of the league\u2019s seven worst records belong to Eastern Conference teams and as the season goes on, calls for a 1-16 playoff format could get louder than ever. A new format isn\u2019t happening this year, and the increased imbalance will likely make for another crazy playoff race in the West. Maybe Jimmy Butler\u2019s move from Minnesota to Philadelphia will help the East\u2019s record, though the Wolves might be better than they were 10 days ago, having added depth and subtracted a headache.

Then, the Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green drew the ire of Kevin Durant for how he handled the final possession of regulation. Lastly, Lou Williams came through in overtime to seal a thrilling win for the Clippers. In short, there were no shortage of storylines in this showdown between these West rivals. Pistons 106, Raptors 104 \u2014 Beating your old team? That\u2019s always sweet for whoever is involved in it. Doing so on a game-winning buzzer-beater? That sweetens the pot a bit more. While Dwane Casey didn\u2019t take a shot on Wednesday, watching Reggie Bullock nail a 5-footer to sink the Raptors had to be rewarding for Toronto\u2019s ex-coach. It was his first game back at his old haunt and, although he was honored by the team for his work, this win had to feel sweet. Magic 111, Sixers 106 \u2014 Jimmy Butler got his wish earlier in the week and was ready to start fresh with the Sixers on Wednesday. Too bad Terrance Ross and the Magic weren\u2019t about to stand idly by for it. Ross nailed the go-ahead 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds left that capped Orlando\u2019s fourth-quarter rally. Even more impressive was that the Magic scored 21 straight points in the fourth quarter and held Philly without a field goal over the game\u2019s final 3 1\/2 minutes. Lakers 126, Blazers 117 \u2014 What, exactly, will LeBron James\u2019 legacy be when he\u2019s done playing? That question came to mind for many after James passed a legend of the game on the all-time scoring list en route to a Lakers win Wednesday. His 44-point outburst pushed him ahead of Wilt Chamberlain for fifth on the all-time list and got the talk flowing about the legacy of perhaps the NBA\u2019s best player today. Celtics 123, Raptors 116 (OT) \u2014 Can we get more than four of these matchups this season, please? Friday\u2019s showdown was another classic between these East heavyweights, as Kyrie Irving dominated down the stretch and into overtime to help Boston even up the season series at 1-1. For the Raptors, Kawhi Leonard delivered (31 points, 15 rebounds, three steals) as he did in the first Celtics-Raptors game, but this time his crew took the loss. Sixers 122, Hornets 119 (OT) \u2014 Days after a so-so Sixers debut, Jimmy Butler reminded all of us why he\u2019s one of the NBA\u2019s best two-way players. First, he swatted away Kemba Walker\u2019s driving, go-ahead layup attempt in overtime and saved the ball. Then, Butler nailed the game-winning 3-pointer in OT with :00.3 left on the clock. Tremendous tip of the hat to Walker, though, who set both career and franchise records in scoring 60 points in the loss. Lakers 113, Heat 97 \u2014 Another day, another milestone for LeBron. He dropped 51 points on Miami, marking the 12th 50-point game in his storied career. He became the fifth player in NBA lore to score 50 or more points with three different franchises and joined Kobe Bryant (60 points) as the only players to score 50 or more points in their 16th season or later. And, James also got his first win against the Heat since leaving them in 2014. Stat Lines of the Week  Karl-Anthony Towns (25 points, 9-11 FG, 2-2 3pt FG, 21 reb, 3 ast in 37 minutes) \u2014 The weight of the Wolves rest on Towns\u2019 shoulders now after the Jimmy Butler trade. He proved he was more than up to that load, though, in rampaging past the Nets on Monday night. | Watch | Video box score LeBron James (44 points, 13-19 FG, 5-6 3pt FG, 10 reb, 9 ast in 36 minutes) \u2014 History struck twice for the former Kia MVP winner this week, with the first instance coming on Wednesday night as he passed Wilt Chamberlain on the all-time scoring list. Not only that, but this win kept the Lakers on the winning side of things and gave them a victory over one of the West\u2019s better teams to open the 2018-19 season. | Watch | Video box score Kyrie Irving (43 points, 18-26 FG, 3-6 3pt FG, 2 reb, 11 ast in 43 minutes) \u2014 Irving had 11 straight Boston points down the stretch assisted on every basket in the extra period to lead Boston to a 123-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday. In short, it was the kind of performance that has Boston thinking it can win the East this season. | Watch | Video box score Kemba Walker (60 points, 21-34 FG, 6-14 3pt FG, 7 reb, 4 ast, 4 stl in 45 minutes) \u2014 Don\u2019t let Walker getting his go-ahead layup try in overtime swatted by Jimmy Butler be the lasting memory of this game from Saturday. Instead, focus on the amazing scoring performance he put on and how he overall lit up Butler ( he shot 15 of 23 against hi m) and the Sixers at large. | Watch | Video box score LeBron James (51 points, 19-31 FG, 6-8 3pt FG, 8 reb, 3 ast in 38 minutes) \u2014 One accolade a week would generally be enough for most NBA superstars. Not so for James, who passed Wilt Chamberlain on Wednesday on the all-time scoring list \u2026 and then lit up Miami with a 51-point game that looked mostly effortless. | Watch | Video box score \u201dThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been striving for my whole life.\u201d \u2014 Jazz forward Joe Ingles , after his wearing of a medical bandana around his head Monday started a social media trend. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about how \u2018is this the end of the run?

He tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn\u2019t work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d \u2014 Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni , on the team parting ways with Carmelo Anthony \u201cMan, he made some shots tonight where you\u2019re just like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 You catch yourself being a fan. When he gets into that mode, the whole arena knew where we were going, and so did the Raptors.

LeBron James was a ringless, 25-year-old superstar when his infamous Decision saw him jump from Cleveland to Miami in 2010. Eight straight Finals appearances, three championships and two more team changes later, the King was back in South Beach on Sunday as a nearly 34-year-old Laker. Heat fans probably felt the only difference was James\u2019 jersey. Other than that, it looked like the exact same LeBron. The devastating dunks in transition. The impossible-to-guard fadeaways. The selective and timely 3-pointers. All of it was working for James, who wound up scorching his old Florida playground for 51 points on 19-for-31 shooting. The performance was James\u2019 12th with at least 50 points, making him just the fifth player in league history to score 50-plus with three different teams. (The others: Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, Bernard King and Jamal Crawford.) More importantly for the Lakers, James\u2019 effort lifted them to their fifth win in six games after a 2-5 start. Believe it or not, L.A. is now just two games out of first place in the Western Conference as the Warriors\u2019 slide continued in San Antonio. As for the Heat, Sunday was a reminder of what the franchise enjoyed for nearly half a decade: Complete dominance by the best player of his generation. Before this season began, Las Vegas had Orlando and Memphis each winning less than 35 games. Less than 20 days into November, both teams are on pace to make the over look like a good bet. The Grizzlies (10-5) logged another quality win over Minnesota with the ageless Marc Gasol pouring in 26 points and 13 rebounds. Beyond him and veteran guard Mike Conley, Memphis\u2019 biggest contributors are fourth overall pick Jaren Jackson Jr. and journeymen Garrett Temple and Shelvin Mack. And yes, that\u2019s the Grizzlies you\u2019re seeing tied for second-best in the West. Back in Florida, Orlando is making noise of its own behind a career year from soon-to-be free agent Nikola Vucevic (20.4 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 1.1 bpg, 1.1 spg, 55.6 FG%, 45.2 FG%). The Magic\u2019s win over the Knicks pushed them back above .500, a place they left for good exactly one year ago today. The Warriors have been a mess since Stephen Curry exited a Nov. 8 game against the Bucks with a groin strain, losing five of their past seven while seeing on-and-off-court drama flair up between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green. Golden State\u2019s latest setback \u2014 a 104-92 loss to the 7-7 Spurs \u2014 punctuated the team\u2019s shortcomings sans Curry: Get well soon, Steph. If he can\u2019t play, Rajon Rondo still wants to be involved. That includes taking up a coach\u2019s clipboard during in-game huddles. Unfortunately for him, he doesn\u2019t yet have leave to take full control of the coaching process. Boban Marjanovic is the tallest cup of chicken noodle soup you have ever seen."},{"id":37363,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wizards-dwight-howard-aggravates-glute-injury","date":"2018-11-19","title":"Washington Wizards\u2019 Dwight Howard aggravates glute injury","content":" WASHHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Washington Wizards center Dwight Howard has aggravated a gluteal injury that kept him out of the first seven games of the season.

But no other player besides him and Irving scored in double figures for Boston. \u201cIf you\u2019re not playing to the standard then, as a team, we just don\u2019t all click,\u201d Irving continued. \u201cI think once we get that, and we find that consistency, we\u2019ll be good.\u201d \u201cThere are times when we play really tough. And then we just have, for whatever reason, moments in the game that turn into extended moments in the game when we\u2019re not,\u201d said Gordon Hayward, who was held to seven points against his former club. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how we can play a full 48 minutes and then do it again the next night when we play. We\u2019re still not there yet.\u201d The Celtics were just 8-for-26 from the field in the third quarter. They had to play much of the period without Irving, who fouled Mitchell on a 3-pointer with 5:40 left. Mitchell made all three from the line to put Utah up 68-55, and then Irving picked up his fifth foul just 28 seconds later. Irving returned in the fourth, but Boston was unable to catch up. Mitchell blocked a dunk attempt by Hayward and Utah took it the other way for an alley-oop dunk by Favors from Geoges Niang to put the Jazz up 83-64 with 9:07 left to play. Stevens had seen enough and pulled most of his starters with about eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. \u201cHe felt like we really weren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d said Al Horford, who scored nine for Boston. \u201cIt can\u2019t only be one or two guys doing the things we all have to do and be consistent with it. [\u2026] It\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re concerned about shots, and our offense\u201d \u201cI would say, thus far, that\u2019s us,\u201d Stevens said after the loss. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s who we\u2019ve been.\u201d The Celtics will have a chance to get back on track against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). * * * Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":37366,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-11-17-18","date":"2018-11-18","title":"About Last Night: Butler's moment, Kemba's night","content":" The storybook night was there for Kemba Walker and the Charlotte Hornets. The 6-foot-1 point guard had 60 points , the ball, and a tie game on his hands with 32 seconds remaining in overtime. But the guy guarding him was Jimmy Butler, whom the Sixers acquired a week ago exactly for moments like this. Granted, Walker had already burned Butler for 60 \u2014 something the 76ers newcomer freely admitted after the game. The Hornets point guard didn\u2019t bail him out either. Walker attacked the basket \u2014 something he does better than all but five players in the league. Three things were in Butler\u2019s favor: Instead of Walker capping off the perfect storybook night, Butler rewrote its final pages. The four-time All-Star blocked Walker\u2019s layup attempt, then saved the loose ball from going out of bounds. On the opposite end, the 76ers again called on Butler. Again, he answered, punching home a dramatic left-side 3-pointer with just 0.3 seconds left. The 122-119 overtime victory was a watershed moment for the 2018-19 Sixers. Before, a near triple-double from Simmons (23 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists) and a dominant performance from Joel Embiid (33 points, 11 rebounds) might not have been enough. With Butler, not even a 60-point special could stop them. The number of times 60-plus didn\u2019t get it done over the last quarter-century: just two out of 17. Walker deserves (and will get) props regardless of the outcome. His 60 points weren\u2019t just a career-high, but a franchise best. That\u2019s significant for a team that just happens to be celebrating its 30th anniversary in the league. That may have been the best part about Walker\u2019s performance: it came with the Hornets\u2019 30th anniversary team on hand to see it. Muggsy Bogues, Alonzo Mourning, Dell Curry, Baron Davis and others watched the current face of the franchise carry the torch and ignite the crowd with it. Walker even broke out the timeless shrug patented by his team\u2019s owner. Until the final seconds, Saturday night belonged to Walker and the city of Charlotte. This dude won a million air miles after he made a layup, 3-pointer and half-court shot. To top it all off, the greatest Maverick ever gave him props! Anthony Davis scored 40-plus for the second straight game, the third time he has accomplished that feat this calendar year. Half of his production occurred at the free throw line, where he enjoyed a 20-for-21 showing. The Nuggets were hard-pressed to keep pace, as they shot just 13 free throws as a team in the 125-115 Pelicans win. One night after attempting 35 shots while registering zero assists, Donovan Mitchell proved his postgame regret was genuine. Utah\u2019s second-year guard scored 28 points (on 21 attempts) while dishing out six assists. Mitchell also added a big block on former Jazz All-Star Gordon Hayward to his timesheet. Luka Doncic was superb in Dallas\u2019 112-109 win over the defending champion Warriors. The third overall pick is playing like the pro he already was before jumping to the NBA, averaging 19.5 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.2 assists.

Of course the splits over the last seven left us puzzled. In four wins, Gasol went for 21.0 ppg, 9.8 rpg and 52.2 3PT%. In three losses: 10.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg and 0-for-8 from deep. 2.

In two previous games, Paul managed 21 and 26 on 15-for-25 shooting. Of course four previous contests saw him combine for just 39 points on 15-for-47 (31.9) shooting.

Aldridge has been hot and cold this month, failing to score in double figures in two of seven and scoring 20 or more just twice.

He missed one game with a hamstring injury and had to leave Wednesday\u2019s game after just 21 minutes with the same injury, so that\u2019ll skew the numbers a bit, which is why he only fell one spot. 8. Taj Gibson (33), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 7 games, 12.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 1.9 apg Season stats: 11.3 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 1.4 apg Gibson started the season sluggishly, failing to score more than 13 points in any of the first 10 games.

And yet here he was in mid-November, five months before the playoffs even begin, licking his chops over a regular-season matchup. For good reason: The Raptors were bringing their NBA-best 12-3 record to Boston for a potential \u2014 if ridiculously early \u2014 preview of the Eastern Conference finals. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that game,\u201d Irving said before Friday\u2019s game. \u201cObviously one game at a time, but that\u2019s just a competitor\u2019s dream to be going against the best of the best.\u201d As he\u2019s done so many times over the years, Irving rose to the occasion with one of the best games of his career, piling up season-highs of 43 points and 11 assists in a thrilling 123-116, overtime victory. Per Elias Sports, Irving is the first Celtic with 40-plus points and 10-plus assists since Antoine Walker in 2001, and third overall. ( Trivia question: What other Boston great did it? Answer below.) Anchored by Irving\u2019s ridiculous efficiency \u2014 the five-time All-Star hit 18 of 26 shots with just three turnovers \u2014 the Celtics overcame some mid-game stumbles to finish the game on a 20-9 run. It wasn\u2019t quite a full turnaround for a team that entered with the NBA\u2019s seventh-worst offensive rating. But with Jayson Tatum chipping in 21 points and Gordon Hayward hitting a handful of key free throws\/shots down the stretch, the Celtics at least looked closer to the contender most expected them to be than the 8-6 mediocrity that entered the game. \u201cIt\u2019s just great (for us) to see the growth,\u201d said Irving, a reference to last month\u2019s 12-point loss to the Raptors. \u201cTo have a great Friday night game, going against the Toronto Raptors \u2026 awesome.\u201d Given how aggressively he forced his way out of Minnesota, it shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise that Jimmy Butler isn\u2019t about to go quietly into the night with his new team. Playing in his first home game with the 76ers, Butler poured in 28 points, including eight in the fourth quarter, with seven assists as they held off the Jazz 113-107. Then came his postgame interview, in which he \u2026 well, just listen for yourself. Not that the Timberwolves are likely to feel too aggrieved by Butler\u2019s pot shot. They drilled the Blazers by 16 for their third straight victory since shipping him out. It took a full half for the Bucks to realize they had a game Friday. Once they did, the results couldn\u2019t have been much more impressive. Down 22 late in the second quarter and 18 at the break, the Bucks sprung to life with a monstrous 46-point third quarter , ultimately outscoring the Bulls by 37 in the second half en route to a 123-104 rout . According to ESPN\u2019s Kevin Pelton, the Bucks narrowly missed breaking the record for largest margin of victory after trailing by at least 18 points at the half. Their second-half shot chart was a masterpiece of modern basketball philosophy, with only two of their 27 buckets coming outside the paint or inside the 3-point line.  And perhaps best part of all: The Bucks didn\u2019t need Giannis Antetokounmpo to be ridiculously great to fuel the comeback. He was instead merely regular great (23 points, 13 rebounds, four assists) as Eric Bledsoe scored 25, Khris Middleton added 23 and the Bucks knocked down 18 3-pointers with 28 assists. \u201cWe knew we weren\u2019t playing hard enough,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201c(Coach Mike Budenholzer) was mad. He was really upset. We don\u2019t have to have that type of half for us to pick it up. From the first minutes of the game, we have to set the tone.\u201d Said Budenholzer, \u201cA lot of credit to the guys for getting it together and playing the way we want to play.\u201d Such enthusiasm wasn\u2019t out of order after Davis managed a paltry two points in the first quarter at Smoothie King Center, at which point the Knicks led by 16. But unfortunately for Robinson and his teammates, NBA games are four quarters long. By the time they\u2019d elapsed, the Knicks were limping out of New Orleans in the face of a truly dominant performance from Davis, who recovered from his poor start to amass a season-high 43 points, 17 rebounds and five assists in a 129-124 victory . Enes Kanter summed up the onslaught as such: Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell also put up an impressive line, but of an entirely different variety. In chucking up 35 shots without a single assist, he became the first player to reach those thresholds since Carmelo Anthony in 2014, and just the fourth since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976-77. And unlike Anthony, who finished with a career-high 62 points, Mitchell converted only 13 shots en route to a relatively paltry 31. Full credit to Mitchell, though, as he at least owned up to the horror show: \u201cI took 35 shots. That can\u2019t happen. Zero assists. It\u2019s not who I am, it\u2019s not who I\u2019ve been. That can\u2019t happen.\u201d The evolution of Markelle Fultz\u2019s shooting stroke continues, and it\u2019s \u2026 something. https:\/\/twitter.com\/sn_nba\/status\/1063617110344155138 https:\/\/twitter.com\/sn_nba\/status\/1063617110344155138 https:\/\/twitter.com\/sn_nba\/status\/1063617110344155138 Little J.T.

He entered Friday night\u2019s games with averages 11.6 points and 6.4 assists through his first five games, but did not have a point or assist in eight minutes against New York before his latest injury."},{"id":37390,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nuggets-add-sue-bird-front-offic","date":"2018-11-16","title":"Nuggets add WNBA champ Sue Bird to front office staff","content":" DENVER \u2013 The Denver Nuggets have added current WNBA Champion Sue Bird to their front office staff as Basketball Operation Associate, President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly announced today. \u201cWe are very excited to have Sue join our organization,\u201d said Connelly. \u201cHer resume certainly speaks for itself and as a still active player she will offer an extremely unique perspective.\u201d Bird recently wrapped up her 16th season in the WNBA which saw her earn her 11th All-Star bid and third WNBA Championship, all with the Seattle Storm.

But so is the stuff between the highlights. Here are some things you may have missed from the last week (or so) of games\u2026 For all videos, press the SLOW-MO button at the bottom right to watch in slow motion. * * * Wed. Nov. 14 \u2013 Sixers at Magic In their first game with Jimmy Butler, the Sixers ran the first play of the first quarter for their new star. With the Magic switching the double pick-and-roll, it didn\u2019t really go anywhere, and Butler was mostly a spectator in the Sixers\u2019 offense throughout the first half. With Minnesota, Butler was in the top 20 of the league in pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game, but the Sixers have run the fewest pick-and-rolls in the league. No other Sixer ranks in the top 65 in pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game. The playbook was limited in Butler\u2019s debut, but Brett Brown will surely add some sets for Butler to do his thing as the season goes on. And down the stretch on Wednesday, the Sixers did run some pick-and-roll with Butler. It was the same set, a Butler-Joel Embiid pick-and-roll from the left side of the floor, three times in a stretch of eight possessions late the Sixers\u2019 111-106 loss to the Magic. The Sixers got three pretty good shots out of the play\u2026 The question to ask is whether it\u2019s good that Embiid is popping out to the perimeter on these pick-and-rolls instead of rolling to the basket. And if the answer to that is no, then the question to ask is if Simmons\u2019 presence on the floor (on the baseline because he can\u2019t shoot) is why Embiid is popping instead of rolling. With the score within five in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime this season, Embiid has taken 12 of his 25 shots from 3-point range and another four from mid-range. He does have a high free throw rate in the clutch, but that shot selection is less than ideal for a guy who\u2019s bigger and stronger than almost anybody else in the league. Fri. Nov. 9 \u2013 Hornets at Sixers With the Sixers up three in overtime last Friday, the Hornets ran a \u201chammer\u201d play to tie the game, and they executed it pretty well, with Malik Monk getting to the baseline, Willy Hernangomez setting a weak-side back-screen for Kemba Walker, and Walker springing free for an open corner three. But it wasn\u2019t open long enough, because Simmons was able to cover a lot of ground and get a hand on Walkers\u2019 shot to tie the game. Tue. Nov. 13 \u2013 Houston at Denver The Rockets\u2019 offense is a lot more fun to watch when the opponent doesn\u2019t switch screens. Alas, sometimes the defense has no choice. In the third quarter on Tuesday, Houston ran a fun play to create a little confusion prior to a James Harden-Clint Capela pick-and-roll along the left sideline. The first time the Rockets ran the play, the Nuggets didn\u2019t switch anything, Nikola Jokic hedged out to Harden (with Gary Harris trailing), Capela got a clean roll to the basket, and Capela got an easy dunk of a perfect pocket pass from the MVP. When the Rockets ran the same play on the very next possession, the Nuggets had Jokic on the weak side and worked out a three-way switch where Paul Millsap picked up Harden, Juancho Hernangomez covered Capela on the roll, and Harris switched onto Hernangomez\u2019s man (P.J. Tucker). Harden, of course, went to an iso. Mon. Nov. 12 \u2013 Utah at Memphis In third quarter on Monday, the Jazz set up in a pretty unique configuration, with four guys bunched together between the foul line and the 3-point arc. Then Derrick Favors ran in a circle around Donovan Mitchell to set a screen for Mitchell to flare out to the left side. It\u2019s an elaborate set-up (a semi-disguised \u201chorns\u201d set) for a Joe Ingles curl around a Rudy Gobert screen that gets a runner for Ingles, with Marc Gasol dropping back to defend Gobert\u2019s roll to the basket (with no help because the Jazz cleared out the right side of the floor). Wed. Nov. 14 \u2013 Miami at Brooklyn A team\u2019s best shooter can often be its most effective screener, because his defender has to choose between sticking with the shooter and helping on guy coming off the screen. In the third quarter of their easy win in Brooklyn on Wednesday, the Heat ran an ATO (after timeout) play with Wayne Ellington setting a back-screen at the left elbow for Tyler Johnson. Joe Harris was guarding Ellington and chose to stay attached, allowing Johnson to get an easy layup off a feed from Justise Winslow. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He does milestones on the big stage about as good as anyone ever has in the NBA. And with all of the chart climbing he\u2019s done throughout his career, particularly in the past few seasons, it\u2019s no wonder he turned in the showcase effort he did Wednesday night in passing Wilt Chamberlain for fifth on the all-time scoring list, joining a fab five of all-time great scorers that starts with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. As historic as LeBron\u2019s monstrous 44-point, 10-rebound, nine-assist effort in the win over Portland was, and with Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars either in attendance or quick to praise the city\u2019s biggest current star for yet another show-stopping performance, it also served as a reminder that he and the Lakers are clearly a threat to the order of things in the Western Conference. And that goes for both this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder and the Western Conference playoff chase that they were watching from the outside as recently as a week ago. LeBron moved up seven spots to second in this week\u2019s MVP Ladder, just behind Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo. (You pass Wilt Chamberlain on any career list and it has to put you in another stratosphere.) The Lakers are doing the same. They sit at 8-6 heading into Saturday\u2019s game in Orlando , the first of a three-game road swing that makes stops in both Miami (Sunday) and Cleveland (Wednesday, 8 ET on ESPN ), the only other NBA cities LeBron has called home during his career. A successful trip could provide an opportunity to make some serious noise in the standings. Despite some early hiccups that should have been expected, LeBron\u2019s obviously making himself at home with the franchise Chamberlain helped to a title before the new No. 5 on the scoring list was born. Those conversations from a few weeks ago, about what the Lakers lacked in ready-for-primetime personnel have shifted; the addition of veteran center Tyson Chandler no doubt providing a boost. All that chatter about LeBron being more interested in being a Hollywood mogul than the most dominant force in the league faded as he turned in his most efficient performance (13-of-19 from the floor and a wicked 5-fo-6 from beyond the 3-point line) of the season in that takedown of the Trail Blazers. Now the rest of the league has to be wondering: Can LeBron impose his will strongly enough and long enough to push these Lakers into the upper echelon of the Western Conference standings? If LeBron\u2019s history is any indication, the rest of the league already has its answer. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week : No. 1 Season stats:  25.8 points, 12.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.4 blocks Even in defeat it\u2019s hard to look beyond Antetokounmpo\u2019s impact for the Bucks. When they suffered their first defeat at Fiserv Forum Wednesday night against the surprising Memphis Grizzlies, Antetokounmpo was once again outstanding. He shredded the Grizzlies for 31 points on an insane 10-for-14 shooting from the floor (11-for-12 from the free-throw line) to go with his nine rebounds, four assists and two blocks. His spectacular footwork and preposterous catch radius makes him a threat from outside the 3-point line and far above the rim, which makes him impossible to prepare for defensively because he stretches the floor in every way imaginable. How many players in NBA history could claim to be a legitimate threat from 3-point range while shooting as poorly (.071) as the Greek Freak has from distance this season? The Bucks have figured out the right formula in surrounding him with pieces that fit perfectly. And to his credit, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer has adjusted his scheme to work for Antetokounmpo, rather than attempting to try it the other way around. Last week : No. 9 Season stats:  27.6 point, 7.9 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.5 steals A record-setting week for LeBron James, passing Wilt Chamberlain for fifth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, comes in the midst of a season-altering turn for the Lakers. Winners of four straight games, and six of their last seven, LeBron\u2019s Lakers have gone from a huge question mark to exactly where many people felt they would be in the Western Conference playoff landscape. The Lakers have earned that 8-6 overall record and have weathered plenty of drama (the fight and suspensions stemming from that Oct. 20 loss to Houston, the Magic Johnson-Luke Walton meeting fallout, etc.) as the league calendar shifts into the holiday season. This is roughly the same point in the season LeBron\u2019s first Miami Heat turned a corner. Walton has managed to get the very best from LeBron while deftly managing his minutes (33.3 in six games this month). That could be a critical move for the Lakers as this season progresses, given the finishing kick that will likely be needed to maintain playoff positioning in the deep Western Conference. Last week : No. 4 Season stats : 26.4 points, 6.2 assists, 5.2 rebounds Lillard and the Trail Blazers are not going away. So anyone expecting some drop-off from their early-season surge is wasting time looking for cracks in their foundation. The Trail Blazers were the forgotten team in the offseason, when everyone was forecasting the Utah Jazz, Denver Nuggets and others as contenders for that No. 3 spot in the Western Conference playoff chase that the Trail Blazers locked up last season. But Lillard\u2019s leadership has been stellar as he and C.J. McCollum\u2019s supporting cast has stepped up to help balance the attack. Lillard had a tough shooting night (8-for-23 from the floor) in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Los Angeles Lakers but still almost finished with a triple-double (31 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds). It was a testament to his ability to impact a game by doing more than just scoring, which remains his most dynamic skill. Portland will need to lean on all that he brings as they continue their six-game road trip tonight at Target Center against the Minnesota Timberwolves . They finish this current swing with another statement game the day after Thanksgiving in Lillard\u2019s hometown (Oakland). Last week : No. 3 Season stats : 24.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists We didn\u2019t get to see Leonard in the Raptors\u2019 previous measuring stick game, when he and Giannis Antetokounmpo both sat out of Milwaukee\u2019s Oct. 29 win over Toronto. But we\u2019ll get to see him in action tonight  (7 ET, ESPN) against a Boston Celtics team most pundits and fans alike picked as the preseason favorite in the Eastern Conference. While the Celtics are still sorting through some things with the return of their veteran All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, the Raptors continue to shine with Leonard firmly entrenched as their No. 1 option. He scored a season-high 31 points in the Raptors\u2019 Oct. 19 win over the Celtics at Air Canada Centre. The Raptors still have the same energized bench they had roughly a month ago, so they\u2019ll hit the floor at TD Garden tonight knowing exactly who and what they are and perhaps more importantly knowing exactly what they have in Leonard, who is sure to be eager to hit the floor again after a late-game turnover cost him a chance at a potential game-winning shot opportunity in Wednesday\u2019s home loss to Detroit . Last week : No. 2 Season stats : 29.5 points, 6.1 assists, 5.0 assists Curry\u2019s value to the Warriors couldn\u2019t be more obvious right now, given the tumultuous week the defending two-time champions have had without their fuel cell in uniform due to a groin injury that has cost him the past four games. He\u2019s going to miss at least three more before being evaluated again, but he\u2019s traveling with the team as they try to steady themselves after losing three of their past five games, including Thursday night\u2019s pasting from the Rockets in Houston. Curry is not only on the mend, the Warriors need him to help mend fences between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green, whose dust-up at the end of regulation Monday night in Los Angeles thrust the entire organization into the headlines for all the wrong reasons. The fact is, the harmonious vibe the Warriors stay locked into on and off the court starts with Curry and his steady and selfless work as the true face of the Warriors machine. Before they hit the floor against the Rockets, Durant and Green vowed that they\u2019d be fine and that the pursuit of a third title would not be undone by one emotional incident. But they didn\u2019t look like a team that had moved on while the Rockets ran them ragged at Toyota Center. They looked like a team in need of its leader, on and off the court. * * * 6.
