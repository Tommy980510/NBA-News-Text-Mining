Here\u2019s a look at five head-to-head matchups we\u2019ll be watching closely this week: * * * Last regular season meeting: Nov. 20, 2019 Westbrook averages a triple-double in this matchup, but the gaudy stats haven\u2019t equated to wins lately for the Rockets\u2019 point guard. In fact, Westbrook has finished on the losing end of this matchup in seven consecutive games, the last defeat coming in a Nov. 20 outing in which he scored 25 points. Additionally, Westbrook hasn\u2019t won a matchup against Murray since Dec. 18, 2017 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Nuggets have won nine of their last 10 games after Sunday\u2019s win vs. the Kings and their 23-9 mark ranks as their best start in franchise history through 32 games. Westbrook has scored at least 20 points in 10 straight outings. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: March 4, 2019  A Kia MVP favorite (Doncic) and a rising star (Dinwiddie) collide here in just the third meeting of their careers. As of Monday, Doncic has 17 career triple-doubles , which ranks as the most in NBA history for a player under the age of 21. And get this: Doncic won\u2019t turn 21 until Feb. 28. Dinwiddie, meanwhile, didn\u2019t start in the first two matchups against Doncic, but that changes in this upcoming game. When these teams met last March, Doncic shot 6 of 16 for 16 points in a loss. On Saturday, Doncic dropped 31 points to go with 15 assists and 12 rebounds for his league-leading ninth triple-double . In that win, Doncic became the first player to log 30-plus points, 10-plus rebounds and 15 or more assists in 30 minutes or fewer since the league first started recording minutes in the 1951-52 season, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Dec. 6, 2019 Beal\u2019s availability for this game could be in question, as he sat out Saturday vs. the Knicks for the first time since Apr. 12, 2017, ending a streak of 194 consecutive games played. Beal missed due to soreness in his right leg, but Wizards coach Scott Brooks said the injury isn\u2019t serious. Butler has come away with wins in three of his last five games against Beal, producing a 28-point triple-double when the teams last faced off on Dec. 6. If Beal is out, Butler could wind up feasting considering Washington forwards Davis Bertans (quadriceps), Rui Hachimura (groin) and center Moritz Wagner (ankle) are all expected to be out for at least this entire week. Miami enters the week on a five-game winning streak. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: March 9, 2019  McCollum had been on a scoring tear, pouring in 20 points or more in six consecutive outings, before contributing 18 on Saturday in a Blazers loss to the Lakers . McCollum is 9-2 in the matchup against Booker and has won each of the last eight head-to-head clashes, including a 26-point outing on 11-of-14 shooting in a Portland win last March over the Suns. Booker, meanwhile, helped Phoenix snap a season-high eight-game skid on Saturday with his 32 points and 10 assists in a win over the Kings. The Suns own a record of 11-5 this season when Booker scores 22 points or more. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 27, 2019 A former Laker included in the trade that landed Davis in Los Angeles, Ingram is mounting a serious bid for his first All-Star appearance. He had 27 points to power the Pelicans to their fourth straight win on Sunday and, overall, is averaging career-highs in scoring (25.3 ppg), rebounds (7.0 rpg) and shooting (49.1%). As of Monday , he\u2019s scored at least 20 points in 27 of his 30 games played this season. Davis is on a roll, too, as this nasty alley-oop illustrates . Davis tweaked his right shoulder on a dunk attempt Saturday against Portland, but played Sunday against the Mavericks. Davis lit up his former squad for 41 points to go with nine boards when the teams last met on Nov. 27, while Ingram logged 10 rebounds \u2013 all on the defensive end. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 1, 2019 Their respective teams continue to struggle, but there\u2019s extensive history in this matchup. Green owns the upper hand, having racked up an 11-7 record in the regular season against Aldridge and a record of 8-1 in the playoffs. Green once held Aldridge to eight points in Game 4 of the 2017 Western Conference finals to help the Warriors to their third-straight trip to The Finals. However, times have changed dramatically for both teams. Aldridge finished last week knocking down a career-high five 3-pointers and is averaging 22 points on 56% shooting from the field and 53% from deep over his last six outings. The Warriors enter the week with a record of 2-13 against teams that are .500 or better, and luckily for them, the Spurs are 13-18. San Antonio won by 17 the last time the teams met in November.

Red-hot Jazz in a rhythm Can one in-season trade reshape a season? It\u2019s happened before in the past and might be what\u2019s happening in Salt Lake City in this campaign. Thanks to the acquisition of Jordan Clarkson from Cleveland last week, the Jazz may have fixed one of their biggest weaknesses \u2014 bench scoring. Utah has won eight of its last 10 games and visits Detroit ( 9 ET, League Pass ). It could be another big night for Clarkson and Co., too, as the Pistons rank 22nd in Defensive Rating . 2. Happy 35th Birthday, LeBron! In just the last 24 hours, the Lakers\u2019 star has been named the Associated Press\u2019 male athlete of the decade and collected his 9,000th career assist . Combine that with all the milestones he\u2019s had throughout his illustrious career, his string of eight straight Finals appearances in the 2010s and you can see LeBron has gifted the NBA world with plenty before he even opens one of his presents on this, his 35th birthday.  3. Injuries piling up for Suns, Blazers The last time Phoenix and Portland played \u2014 a 111-110 thriller the Blazers won on Dec. 16 \u2014 both teams were hoping for brighter days in the West playoff chase. Since then, the Suns saw Deandre Ayton return on Dec. 18 \u2026 and then miss the next five games (and counting) with an ankle injury. As for the Blazers, they lost Skal Labissiere to an ankle injury in their Saturday loss to the Lakers. A showdown tonight ( 10 ET, NBA TV ) shouldn\u2019t be all doom and gloom though, as a chance to watch Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker take on Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard makes this one worth a viewing. 4. Isaac shining bright in Orlando Inconsistency has marked the Magic all season, but they might be turning things around a little here with two wins in their last three games. One player who has been reliable, though, is third-year big man Jonathan Isaac. As the Hawks visit tonight ( 7 ET, NBA TV ), he is averaging career bests in scoring (12.3 points), rebounding (7.1), blocks (2.5), steals (1.5) and assists (1.4) and is coming off an eight-steal (!!) game vs. the Sixers on Friday. 5. Remembering a dime-dropping record Russell Westbrook? Nope. John Stockton? Close, but not quite. Rajon Rondo? No there, too. Since Dec. 30, 1991, no one has ever had more assists in an NBA game than the 30 that Magic guard Scott Skiles piled up against the Denver Nuggets. For a hard-working, former journeyman point guard to accomplish the feat in a golden age of point guards was something to behold and, as such, we pay homage to that moment today."},{"id":29746,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-james-harden-questionable-toe-injury","date":"2019-12-29","title":"James Harden out vs. Pelicans with toe injury","content":" A right toe sprain kept James Harden out of Houston\u2019s 127-112 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night. Harden appeared to hurt his toe when teammate Danuel House Jr. and Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie fell into him during Saturday night\u2019s 108-98 win . After the game, Harden said he was fine, according to Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle . The Rockets (22-11) were also without All-Star guard Russell Westbrook, who continues to sit out the second-half of back-to-back games in an effort to ease his way back from injury, and center Clint Capela, who will miss a second-straight game with a bruised heel."},{"id":29777,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-male-athlete-decade","date":"2019-12-29","title":"The King reigns: LeBron James named AP's male athlete of decade","content":" He left Cleveland for Miami, finally became a champion, went back to his beloved northeast Ohio, delivered on another title promise, then left for the Los Angeles Lakers and the next challenge. He played in eight straight finals. No NBA player won more games or more MVP awards over the last 10 years than he did. He started a school. He married his high school sweetheart. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d LeBron James asked, feigning disbelief. No, that\u2019s not all. Those were just some highlights of the last 10 years. There were many more, as the man called \u201cKing\u201d spent the last decade reigning over all others \u2014 with no signs of slowing down. James is The Associated Press male athlete of the decade, adding his name to a list that includes Tiger Woods, Wayne Gretzky and Arnold Palmer. He was a runaway winner in a vote of AP member sports editors and AP beat writers, easily outpacing runner-up Tom Brady of the New England Patriots. \u201cYou add another 10 years of learning and adversity, pitfalls, good, great, bad, and any smart person who wants to grow will learn from all those experiences,\u201d James, who turns 35 Monday, told The AP . \u201cA decade ago, I just turned 25. I\u2019m about to be 35 and I\u2019m just in a better (place) in my life and have a better understanding of what I want to get out of life.\u201d Usain Bolt of Jamaica was third for dominating the sprints at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, soccer superstar Lionel Messi was fourth and Michael Phelps \u2014 the U.S. swimmer who retired as history\u2019s most decorated Olympian with 28 medals, 23 gold \u2014 was fifth. James was revealed as the winner Sunday, one day after Serena Williams was announced as the AP\u2019s female athlete of the decade. In his 17th season, he\u2019s on pace to lead the league in assists for the first time while remaining among the NBA\u2019s scoring leaders. \u201cWhen LeBron James is involved,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said, \u201cI\u2019m never surprised.\u201d Including playoffs, no one in the NBA scored more points than James in the last 10 years. He started the decade 124th on the league\u2019s all-time scoring list. He\u2019s now about to pass Kobe Bryant for No. 3. No. 2 Karl Malone and No. 1 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are within reach. Is Abdul-Jabbar in his sights? Is catching him the new decade\u2019s goal? \u201cI would be lying if I said I don\u2019t see it,\u201d James said. \u201cObviously I\u2019m not trying to say, `OK, well if I play this amount of time, if I average this\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m not doing that because I\u2019ve never done that with my career. I\u2019ve always just kind of let it happen. Whatever happens, happens. But I see it. I do see it.\u201d His work ethic, even now, makes even those closest to him marvel. Here\u2019s a typical day this past summer for James, who remains obsessed with working even though fame and fortune found him long ago: He\u2019d wake up at 3 a.m. and be at the Warner Bros. lot by 3:45 \u2013 where a weight room and court, built just for him, were waiting. He\u2019d be lifting by 4 a.m., getting shots up by 5:30 and be ready to start another day of shooting the remake of \u201cSpace Jam\u201d that he has been planning for years by 7 a.m. \u201cThat\u2019s who he is,\u201d said Mike Mancias, one of the longest-tenured and most trusted members of James\u2019 inner circle, tasked for more than 15 years with keeping James fit. \u201cHe does whatever it takes when it comes to fulfilling his commitments to everything \u2014 especially his game and his craft.\u201d The 2010s for James started with \u201cThe Decision,\u201d the widely criticized televised announcement of his choice to leave Cleveland for Miami. (Lost in the hubbub: The show raised more than $2.5 million for charity.) He was with the Heat for four years, went to the NBA Finals all four times with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, finally won the title in 2012 \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s about damn time,\u201d he said at the trophy celebration \u2014 and led the way in a Game 7 win over San Antonio to go back-to-back the following year. \u201cHe grew immensely here as a leader,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cHe impacted winning as much as with his leadership as he did with his talent. I think that was the most important thing he learned with us. And he\u2019s been able to take that to different franchises and continue using that as a template.\u201d Cleveland was devastated when he left. It forgave him. James returned home in 2014, took Cleveland to four consecutive finals, then led the Cavaliers to the 2016 title and came up with one of the biggest plays of his life by pulling off a chase-down block of Golden State\u2019s Andre Iguodala in the final seconds of Game 7 of that series. And in 2018, he was off to LA. Going Hollywood made so much sense \u2014 he\u2019s making movies, has a production company, has a program called \u201cThe Shop\u201d as part of his `Uninterrupted\u2019 platform featuring an array of guests from Drake to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed a bill on the show that will allow college athletes to get paid for the use of their likeness and sign endorsement deals. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moments from this decade that would be up there, winning the two Miami championships, winning a championship in Cleveland, the chase-down block,\u201d James said. \u201cBut the best moment? Definitely marrying Savannah. That would be No. 1.\u201d James and longtime partner Savannah Brinson got married six years ago. They already had two sons \u2014 both are very good basketball players already \u2014 and added a daughter in 2014. James also spent most of the last decade as a lightning rod for critics. He used his voice often on social matters, speaking out after the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and campaigning for Hillary Clinton. He supported Colin Kaepernick\u2019s methods of protesting police brutality and racial injustice. Most recently, he was criticized by many \u2014 including top U.S. lawmakers \u2014 for his remarks after Houston general manager Daryl Morey sparked a massive rift between the NBA and China by sending out a tweet supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. \u201cI don\u2019t live in regret,\u201d James said. \u201cThere\u2019s no moment in this last decade that I wish I could have back. If a situation was bad or you feel like you could have done better, then I learned from it.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how much longer he\u2019ll play. He laments missing time with his children. His \u201cI Promise\u201d school that opened in 2018 in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, has been an immediate success story, and he wants to see that enterprise continue growing. Some love him. Some don\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cWhen you believe in your calling or you believe in yourself, then it doesn\u2019t matter what other people say or how other people feel,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd if you allow that to stop you or deter you from your mission, then you don\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d And in the 2010s, nothing deterred James."},{"id":29750,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/holiday-brothers-nba-record-same-game","date":"2019-12-29","title":"Holiday brothers set NBA record as all three play during Pacers-Pelicans game","content":"It took just seven minutes and 47 seconds for the Holiday brothers to make NBA history on Saturday, as Aaron started for Indiana, Jrue started for the Pelicans and then Justin checked in off the bench for the Pacers.

Several NBA players were asked their favorite moment of the 2010s (omitting any moments related to their careers) as this decade reaches a close. Common answers include Kobe Bryant\u2019s unbelievable finale in 2016 and Derrick Rose\u2019s 50-point eruption in 2018, but other memorable moments such as Ray Allen\u2019s iconic shot in the 2013 Finals were mentioned. Here\u2019s what a few players around the league had to say: * * * \u201cIt was Miami Heat vs. San Antonio , they rolled the trophy out, LeBron misses a shot, Chris Bosh gets a great rebound from the right block and passes it out to Ray Allen who relocates and hits the shot. That was stunning to me. I think just like anyone else in America I was like, \u2018Welp this game is over and we\u2019re just waiting to see the Spurs celebrate and Kawhi not laugh and have any emotion or anything.\u2019 It was dope to see him go out there and make that shot. That shot was big time. That shot\u2019s a historic shot, especially in LeBron\u2019s career and especially in the NBA\u2019s decade right now. That shot is something I won\u2019t forget because I remember jumping out my seat when he caught the rebound and said \u2018that\u2019s in\u2019 and my dad was like \u2018no way.'\u201d \u201c The Kobe final game , when he scored 60 points and his team won. He gave it all until the very end. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. He played every game like it was his last, and even the last one.\u201d  \u201cFor me, it was Kobe\u2019s last game . Nobody I can think of went out the way that he did, man. He told me after the game was over, he couldn\u2019t even walk to his car.\u201d  \u201cFavorite moment. That\u2019s hard. The 60-point game from Kobe? It\u2019s hard to say. Moments like that are almost bigger than basketball because it\u2019s like it encapsulates somebody\u2019s entire career. With Kobe, he\u2019s always been a performer, always stepped up to the challenge and the big moments. And I think everybody was watching Kobe\u2019s last game. To put on a performance like that was incredible. I certainly watched it on a big-screen at home. \u201c D-Rose , I\u2019ve known Derrick since I was, I think, 11 years old, 12 years old. After all that he had gone through. I saw him here [in Cleveland], played against him when he was an MVP, was with him on world championship teams [with Team USA], known his family for a long time. To see that, him coming back and having a 50-point game after all that he had been through was super emotional and positive. I\u2019m trying to think of all the moments like that that stick out. \u201c I actually think Klay Thompson because I grew up with him. When he had 11 dribbles and scored 60 points, man, that will never be done again. Eleven dribbles, 60 points, that will never be done again. Mark my words. I mean, James [Harden] scores 65 and does 700 dribbles. And that\u2019s really impressive. I\u2019ve never seen a scorer like him. But then again, I mean, 11 dribbles? Consider that. That\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s tough because there were so many moments. But I\u2019ve never heard of anybody doing what Klay did, going to get 60 on 11 dribbles . I think Golden State caught a perfect storm and had the perfect pieces for something like that to happen. Sixty on 11 dribbles, no, that\u2019s not ever happening again.\u201d \u201c The continuous evolution . There\u2019s not a moment, but 2010 was a completely different style of basketball. And the game has grown internally as well. [It\u2019s great] how much the franchises invest into player development from a physical standpoint and a mental standpoint. Everything has grown so much, and you could see it on the floor and what the final product is.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019d probably say when the Heat beat OKC for the first time. That was pretty special. LeBron, D-Wade and all them. That was my favorite team growing up, that was pretty special. Growing up, being a LeBron fan, D-Wade fan, being able to see that happen was pretty special.\u201d  \u201c D-Rose coming back and scoring 50 . Seeing him come back and go play at a high level from injuries. It\u2019s always great to see certain guys come back from major injuries and still do some great things. Everybody\u2019s been a big fan of Derrick. To see him come back and play the way he\u2019s playing right now is probably one of the best moments.\u201d  \u201c When the Spurs won the championship . Watching those guys, especially Boris [Diaw], Tony [Parker], the French guys win the NBA title, it was a great moment. It was big for me, it was inspirational, especially after seeing them lose the year before and lose badly. Being able to come back from that was huge, and it was great to watch Tony and those guys win.\u201d  \u201cDefinitely Kobe\u2019s last game was by far the best [moment] just because all the things he had been through. I would say Kobe\u2019s last game, and Derrick Rose, when he went for [50] . You could just tell. He was crying after that game because he just left it all out there on the floor. Even though he\u2019s still playing I would say Derrick Rose\u2019s moment was one that really meant a whole lot just because of all his injuries and all that extra stuff that was going on with him. Those two sit up there at the very top of my list.\u201d  \u201cHonestly being an Ohio guy, watching LeBron and them win that first title was pretty cool. Even though I\u2019m competing against him, at the same time I know what that meant to the state. It was pretty cool.\u201d  \u201c Seeing Toronto win the championship and actually being in the building to witness that. I was sitting with T-Mac, and I remember two minutes left in the game, maybe a minute and a half, I remember turning to him saying, \u2018They\u2019re actually about to do this. The Toronto Raptors are about to have a championship.\u2019 And that was probably one of the most surreal, unreal feelings and defining moments of the last 20 years for me. Seeing guys that I know. Kyle\u2019s a good friend of mine and golfing buddy. I was genuinely happy for the organization and people I know there.\u201d  \u201cIn this decade, there were quite a few great moments.

Five years earlier, Thorn proved similarly clever in assessing a pair of league newcomers, lavishing faint praise on a couple of college kids. \u201cIf they don\u2019t turn out to be great,\u201d Thorn predicted before the 1979-80 season, \u201cthey will be better than mundane. Neither will be a bust.\u201d Both Larry Bird and Magic Johnson indeed proved to be better than mundane. And lo these many years later, we can say definitively that neither was anything close to a bust. Bird and Johnson proved to be two of the greatest players in NBA history. Candidates, if not shoo-ins, for any serious Mt. Rushmore lineup. The pair of superstars helped carry the league from its rocky mid-to-late 1970s to a global, multibillion dollar industry with popularity, cultural influences and franchise valuations soaring into the \u201890s and beyond. They also came to embody one of the famous and heated rivalries in sports, an individual matchup heightening the stakes of the longstanding Celtics-Lakers feud. Put it up there with Ali-Frazier, Yankees-Red Sox, predecessors Chamberlain and Russell, Packers-Bears, Borg-McEnroe and Buckeyes-Wolverines. It all started four decades ago. On Dec. 28, 1979, Bird and Johnson met for the first of 37 NBA matchups (regular season and playoffs) when the former\u2019s Boston Celtics played the latter\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers. They already had goosed men\u2019s college basketball in March of that year, when the two became household names in Michigan State\u2019s NCAA tournament victory over Indiana State. That game, with Johnson\u2019s deeper, more tested Spartans team prevailing in Salt Lake City over Bird\u2019s Sycamores, ranks as the most watched title game in Final Four history, before or since. There was no assurance that the two players \u2014 and the dynamic and charisma between them \u2014 would have a similar effect on the pro game. Until they did, beyond all expectations, starting almost immediately as rookies. \u201cI thought that first year was what made their NBA careers,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who was a senior at Proviso East High just outside Chicago during Bird\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s debut NBA season. \u201cBird wins the Rookie of the Year that year. [Kareem] Abdul-Jabbar has [an injury in the championship round]. Magic has the big game, wins the MVP of the Finals. I don\u2019t know how they could have scripted that better. That was the start of it.\u201d Said Dallas\u2019 Rick Carlisle, who watched that 1979 championship battle on a small black-and-white TV at the prep school (Worcester Academy) he was attending: \u201cThey became the two centerpiece guys of the Eastern and Western Conference, and that rivalry was really the story of the league for the next 8-to-10 years. Things happen for a reason.\u201d A pause, for context. The NBA was a vastly different place back then, in quantity, in quality and in the minds of the sports public. Among other distinguishing traits: It got more than it could have imagined when the two college stars turned what could have been a heated one-off NCAA battle into a long-running dramatic series. Bird and Johnson were as compelling in their similarities as they were in their differences. And vice versa. One had an unusual name but the other already had a flashy nickname, dating back to the flair he\u2019d shown in high school. Bird was the self-described \u201cHick from French Lick [Ind.],\u201d while Johnson grew up in East Lansing, Mich. And in a country perpetually reckoning with race, one was white, the other black. They both stood about 6-foot-9 and \u2014 unlike a lot of NBA stars at that time \u2014 seemed driven by two basketball passions: passing the ball and winning. They played below the rim and lacked dazzling athletic ability. Yet they had similar court vision, competitiveness and an ability to slow down the game, in ways that elevated not just themselves but their teammates\u2019 performances. Bird, nearly three years older than Johnson, had gone through the Draft before he even finished college. An aborted stint at Indiana University had started his college clock, so by the time he transferred to Indiana State and was prepping for his final season, he qualified as a \u201cjunior-eligible\u201d (four years removed from high school). The teams near the top of the 1978 draft knew they could not entice Bird to leave school early \u2014 he had promised his mother he\u2019d graduate. Nor were they willing to wait a year and risk losing his rights entirely if he re-submitted in 1979. The Indiana Pacers, in particular, owned the No. 1 pick, but traded it to Portland in a deal that dropped them to No. 3 \u2026 and still wouldn\u2019t gamble. \u201cThat would have been a helluva thing, the Pacers getting Bird as a local guy,\u201d said longtime NBA columnist and analyst Peter Vecsey. \u201cMy God, wait a freaking year.\u201d That\u2019s what Boston\u2019s Red Auerbach did at No. 6. He took Bird in one of the slickest personnel maneuvers since, well, Auerbach\u2019s deal with St. Louis in 1956 to acquire and sign Bill Russell. Johnson\u2019s arrival in L.A. had its own unusual back story. The Lakers in 1978-79 had finished 47-35, tied for the league\u2019s sixth-best record. They should have been in no position to draft the Michigan State phenom \u2014 except for a compensation package of draft picks they got from the New Orleans after the Jazz signed veteran guard Gail Goodrich in July 1976. New Orleans\u2019 26-56 record was the league\u2019s worst by the spring of \u201979 \u2014 remember, the franchise was about to move to Salt Lake City \u2014 so the Lakers went into the traditional coin flip in those pre-lottery days. They edged out Chicago, who settled for David Greenwood at No. 2 (but could have selected Sidney Moncrief, Bill Laimbeer or Bill Cartwright, a big man the Bulls eventually needed to win alongside Michael Jordan). That\u2019s how Bird went East to Boston and Johnson went West to L.A., each quickly becoming identified with those markets and their teams\u2019 style of play. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in conspiracy theories, it was absolutely the best places for both guys\u201d said former Bucks and Celtics guard Quinn Buckner, a longtime Pacers commentator. \u201cBy personality \u2014 blue-collar, Boston. L.A., Showtime. It couldn\u2019t have been done any better. When Magic got out there, he changed the dynamic of the team. And Larry did the same with the Celtics.\u201d Even separated by three time zones and 3,000 miles, the bond \u2014 a cantankerous one at that \u2014 between the two future legends was evident. At least to them. \u201cI knew that whatever team he played for and whatever team I played for were going to be battling for whatever\u2019s there,\u201d Bird said years later. Both faced in-house challenges first. Johnson, for instance, had a salty Spencer Haywood on the Lakers roster, the veteran not keen on heeding floor directions from a 20-year-old. Then there was Norm Nixon, the point guard whose position Johnson would be usurping. For Bird, skeptical veterans such as Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe were sent packing almost as soon as he outplayed them in training camp. That left teammate Cedric Maxwell, who by his own admission was yapping and needed convincing that \u201cthis white boy\u201d could play. Said Bird: \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long to get him quiet.\u201d The Celtics were up first, opening at Boston Garden against a Houston team featuring eventual Hall of Famers Moses Malone and Rick Barry. Bird logged 28 minutes, shot 6-for-12 and finished with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114-106 victory. Maxwell scored 22 points and, of special interest, their teammate Chris Ford took and made the first 3-pointer in NBA history that night. Three hours later, in San Diego, Johnson officially went to work for the first time as a Laker. His numbers were impressive \u2013 26 points, 8 boards, 4 assists, 4 blocks \u2013 but he left an indelible impression at the very end. That\u2019s when Abdul-Jabbar dropped in a hook shot for a 103-102 victory, sending the rookie into the surprised team captain\u2019s arms. Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s first thought: We\u2019ve got 81 more to go, rook. But Johnson\u2019s enthusiasm was exactly what the been-there, done-it-all big man needed, starting a partnership that would re-define him even as it defined Johnson. The Lakers were playing their third game in three nights when Boston got to the Forum for the post-Christmas clash. L.A. had just played at Kansas City and at Utah. The Celtics were only slightly better off, sandwiching in the Lakers during a back-to-back-to-back stretch that had them in San Diego and Golden State on their five-game West Coast swing. It was Boston\u2019s 37th game of the season and the Lakers\u2019 40th; they began the night at 28-8 and 26-13, respectively. A decade earlier, the rivalry between the two franchises was raw, with Boston winning all seven of their Finals showdowns between 1959 and 1969. From Russell and John Havlicek to Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain, some of the greatest players in league annals had participated, with only one side collecting rings. Bird acknowledged he was as intrigued about playing in the same game as Abdul-Jabbar as he was with seeing his old nemesis Johnson. But the media had done their work, pumping excitement into this matchup. Then-NBA Commissioner Larry O\u2019Brien spoke of a \u201cplayoff atmosphere\u201d for a date that became the Lakers\u2019 first sellout in nearly a season-and-a-half. For L.A. fans, it was all they expected and more: A 123-105 cruise for the home team, with Johnson (23 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists) outplaying Bird (16-4-3 with 4 steals). \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll forget about this game,\u201d Bird told reporters afterward, perhaps trying to convince himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll be so far away from here. You\u2019ve gotta keep moving. In a few days we\u2019ll be home, and we won\u2019t even know what night we played the Lakers.\u201d There was a moment in the fourth quarter, at least, when there was no mistaking who was playing whom \u2013 Johnson drove into the lane and got knocked down by Bird. Some words and glares were exchanged before the two were pushed apart. \u201cThat was on me,\u201d Bird said last week. \u201cHe was my competition.\u201d Sixteen nights later, the Celtics and their rookie star knew precisely whom they were playing. By the time they met at Boston Garden for the first of many rematches, Boston had surpassed its victory total (29) from the season before, sitting at 32-10. The Lakers were 30-15, a two-game improvement over the pace for their 45-game mark in 1978-79. The Sunday matinee received the full budding-rivalry treatment on CBS, with a broadcast crew of Brent Musberger and Hot Rod Hundley. Video of the game, while labeled incorrectly as the \u201cfirst\u201d meeting, can be found on the Internet. \u201cNice to watch two highly touted rookies come into the league who feature passing,\u201d Musberger said early in the telecast. \u201cMagic Johnson and Larry Bird, unselfish athletes.\u201d He added: \u201cLarry Bird with something to prove. He felt he was put down a little bit after that earlier loss this season to the Lakers in Los Angeles.\u201d Of Johnson, who was hobbled by a groin injury and lasted just 21 minutes, making one free throw and missing two shots, Musberger said: \u201cObviously he is slowed. \u2026 He was very badly bruised. Extremely painful. He was not at full strength at Detroit [Friday], and he\u2019s not at full strength again today. But he\u2019s extremely intelligent for a 20-year-old.\u201d Nixon dished nine assists while handling much of the playmaking for the Lakers, who won again. Abdul-Jabbar gave a vintage 33-point, 12-rebound performance. Dave Cowens had 22 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists to lead the Celtics. Bird finished with 14 points and 12 boards, while being hounded by young Michael Cooper, who would pester him defensively for years. At one point in the third quarter, Bird blocked a dunk attempt by Abdul-Jabbar. Midway through the fourth, he sparked a Celtics rally that tied it 91-91. It was 98-98 with 21 seconds remaining, until Nixon got fouled on Los Angeles\u2019 final possession and hit both free throws with three seconds left. Cowens\u2019 shot at the buzzer from the left wing missed, and Johnson\u2019s team again had beaten Bird\u2019s. Johnson often spoke of the hold his rivalry with Bird, and their respective squads, had on him: each summer when the NBA schedule was released, he said, he would circle the two Boston-L.A. games. That relegated everything else on the Lakers\u2019 schedule to \u201cthe other 80.\u201d Well, Johnson and his team did well in those other 80 the first year, going 22-5 after the All-Star break to finish 13 games ahead of the pre-Magic edition. And then they really picked up the pace in the playoffs. The Lakers ousted Phoenix and defending champion Seattle in five games each before hooking up with Philadelphia in the Finals. Boston\u2019s 61-21 record marked a 32-game improvement over the previous season and the franchise\u2019s second-best mark since Russell retired (68-14 in 1973). The Celtics swept Houston in the first round, then got bumped off by Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks and the rest of the 76ers in the East finals. Bird finished at 21.3 ppg, 10.4 rpg and 4.5 apg, with 1.7 steals and 40.6 accuracy from the arc (on a now-modest 143 attempts). As the catalyst for Boston\u2019s turnaround as a team, he was voted the NBA\u2019s Rookie of the Year, with Johnson finishing second. The young Lakers guard had averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds and 7.3 assists. While the order of finish wasn\u2019t a surprise, but the final tally was: Bird 63, Johnson 3. Bird also wound up fourth in MVP balloting. As Johnson later remembered, he learned of Bird\u2019s landslide ROY victory between Game 5 and Game 6 of the Finals. Most other NBA fans simply recall that gap for the news that Abdul-Jabbar, with a badly injured ankle, would not travel to Philadelphia with his team leading 3-2 in the best-of-seven series. That\u2019s when Johnson nominated himself to take the veteran center\u2019s spot in the opening tipoff. In fact, the Lakers\u2019 irrepressible rookie logged minutes at all five positions that night. He finished with 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists in 47 minutes to nail down the Lakers\u2019 first title since 1972, and was named Finals MVP three months before he turned 21. Turns out, Johnson was motivated by that Rookie vote count. \u201cEven though I won the championship, I still wanted to win Rookie of the Year too,\u201d he said in HBO\u2019s 2010 documentary on the pair, \u201cMagic & Bird: A Courtship of Rivals.\u201d Said Bird: \u201cWhen he won that championship, I was pissed. I wanted one.\u201d Bird would get his \u2014 the first of three championships for him \u2014 12 months later when Boston beat Houston in six games. He and the Celtics would win again in 1984 and 1986. That \u201984 title came in the first head-to-head Finals clash with Johnson and the Lakers, the most satisfying triumph of his career. The Lakers countered against Boston in the 1985 Finals, though. Then took the rubber match in 1987. Overall, after the two rookie meetings, they faced each other 35 more times \u2014 16 in the regular season, 19 games in the Finals. Johnson missed five more games with injuries \u2014 after the Jan. 13, 1980 meeting, for instance, they didn\u2019t play again until Valentine\u2019s Day 1982. Bird went missing from two, and there was one more in February 1989 when both were sidelined. Johnson averaged 19.4, 6.8 rebounds and 11.5 assists while winning 11 of their 18 regular-season contests. Bird was at 21.7, 10.9 and 6.2. Both players then upped their games in the playoffs: Johnson\u2019s 20.7\/7.5\/13.5 to Bird\u2019s 25.3\/11.1\/4.6. The Lakers won 11 of the 19 Finals games for a 2-1 edge in rings. One team or the other won eight of nine Finals from 1980 through 1988. Either Bird or Johnson (three each) won six of the NBA\u2019s seven MVP awards from 1984 through 1990. And as anticipated and exhilarating as their actual matchups were, either in winter or spring, just having the potential for that for a decade or so \u2014 while each led a marquee franchise in dramatically different styles \u2014 helped carry the NBA to new heights. Neither claims the credit that often is proffered for \u201csaving\u201d the NBA. What they will accept is how popular they made it for NBA stars to pass, setting up teammates rather than looking for their own points. And how pure their competition was, laser-focused on each other time and again on the league\u2019s biggest stage. But it\u2019s important to look at other factors in the NBA\u2019s \u201880s turnaround: the infusion of ABA talent; David Stern\u2019s rise to the commissioner\u2019s office; subsequent NBA stars entering the league like Kevin McHale, Isiah Thomas, James Worthy and Dominique Wilkins, followed by Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t overnight,\u201d said Vecsey. \u201c[The ABA] can\u2019t be overlooked. Guys who came in, Julius [Erving], Artis Gilmore, David Thompson, George Gervin, Dan Issel, Maurice Lucas, Moses Malone \u2013 I mean, what the hell?! All at one time. That, to me, was the start of a new league. \u201cAll the ABA guys came into the NBA saying, \u2018What is this slow [stuff]?\u2019 And they amped it up. So now you\u2019ve got two superstars, big names, white-black, Lakers-Celtics, everything people talk about. But it took a lot of stars aligning. There were so many things \u2018wrong\u2019 with the league back then, it took more than two guys.\u201d Consider: The NBA signed a new network TV deal before the 1982-83 season. Yet there still were playoff games shown on a tape-delayed basis until 1986. Eddie Johnson, who played 16 NBA seasons (1982-99) talked recently of Stern\u2019s impact on the \u201cNBA Today\u201d show he co-hosts on Sirius XM satellite radio. \u201cWhen David Stern had it, especially [early], there were about five or six teams ready to go under. Including the team I was playing for, the Kansas City Kings. He had to try to change that mindset. And what he did, he entrusted two individuals: Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. He entrusted them to take the league and get it attention, and take it to a higher level. \u201cIt was not easy to do in that day and age of the NBA, when there were so many negative things going on.\u201d Bird and Johnson drew positive motivations from each other. The mere idea that the other guy might be gaining an edge or widening his lead goaded each to get better, dream bigger, chase harder. Even after a 1995 sneaker commercial tipped their relationship toward a friendship. Bird talked for years after they were done of stalking Johnson via box scores. \u201cI had to have him there for some reason,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a crutch, somebody I could compare myself to.\u201d Said Johnson: \u201cThat\u2019s why we hated each other. We knew we were mirrors of each other.\u201d Mirrors that glared at each other on NBA courts for the first time, 40 years ago. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Randolph sat out the entire 2018-19 season, as the Dallas Mavericks waived him in February, after bringing him aboard in a trade with the Kings. The former Michigan State Spartan finished his NBA career averaging 16.6 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. Perhaps Randolph\u2019s most significant contributions came during his time with the Grizzlies, where he helped to usher in the Grit and Grind era with a franchise that became a consistent sellout after years of empty seats at the FedEx Forum. In Memphis, Randolph averaged 16.8 points and 10.2 rebounds, playing a key role in the club advancing to the playoffs for seven consecutive seasons. \u201cOne of the nicest human beings that I truly admire,\u201d former teammate Tony Allen told NBA.com . \u201cSalute to his hard work and dedication to the game. Ultimately, he is my brother and one of the pioneers of the GNG era.\u201d Led by Randolph\u2019s 31 points and 11 rebounds in Game 6 of the 2011 opening round of the Western Conference playoffs, the Grizzlies knocked off the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs. At the time, the Grizzlies were one of two No. 8 seeds to unseat a top-seeded foe since the league expanded the opening-round series to a best-of-seven format. In 2007, the Golden State Warriors defeated the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks in six games. Randolph earned two NBA All-Star appearances and won the Most Improved Player award in 2003-04. He was also an All-NBA third-teamer in 2010-11. Randolph competed in 70 postseason contests, in addition to finishing five seasons averaging more than 20 points per game and nine more averaging 10 rebounds or more. Randolph, 38, finished his career as Memphis\u2019 all-time leader in field goals and rebounds. Grizzlies majority owner Robert Pera said back in 2017 that no other player in the franchise will ever wear Randolph\u2019s No. 50 again. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Leonard was the NBA Finals MVP for the second time, leading Toronto to its first championship \u2013 five years after he first smudged his fingerprints on both trophies with the San Antonio Spurs. He wound up leaving the Raptors in the summer for the Clippers, returning to his native Southern California and turning the historically woeful franchise into one of the top teams in the league. \u201dThe ride was fun,\u201d Leonard said earlier this month on his return trip to Toronto, summing up his year with the Raptors. \u201dI had a great time.\u201d By now, it\u2019s no secret that Leonard is a man of few words. He is not a man of few accomplishments. He received more than twice as many points in the balloting as any of the other 18 vote-getters. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was second, followed by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , tennis star Rafael Nadal and reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201dKawhi\u2019s pretty steady,\u201d said San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, Leonard\u2019s former coach with the Spurs. \u201dHe\u2019s not a big talker. He doesn\u2019t try to find the limelight or anything like that. He\u2019s just a good guy who wanted to be good.\u201d Somewhere along the way, he became great. Leonard was the best player in last season\u2019s playoffs, after a regular season where he missed 22 games mostly because of what has become known as \u201dload management\u201d \u2013 the fancy term used on nights when he would sit out to rest. Leonard missed most of the 2017-18 season with the Spurs because of a complicated leg issue, and the NBA said last month that he is still dealing with \u201dan ongoing injury to the patella tendon in his left knee.\u201d He was limping at times in the playoffs, but it didn\u2019t matter. He averaged 30.5 points and 9.1 rebounds in the postseason, his 732 points in last year\u2019s playoffs ranking as the third-most in any NBA playoff year. In the biggest times, he came up the biggest \u2013 15 points in the fourth quarter to carry Toronto past Milwaukee in the series-turning Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, and 17 points in the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the NBA Finals against Golden State to put the Raptors on the cusp of the title. And, of course, he made The Shot: the four-bounce-off-the-rim, at-the-buzzer jump shot from the corner to beat Philadelphia in Game 7 of the second round. \u201dWithout a doubt,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse mused during the playoff run, \u201dthe best thing about this thing is that somehow I wound up on the sideline getting to watch this guy play up close.\u201d Leonard performed at that lofty level even while dealing with a major distraction. During the NBA Finals, it was revealed that Leonard filed a federal lawsuit against Nike and claimed the footwear and apparel giant was blocking him from using a logo that he believes he owns. \u201dThere\u2019s a lot of guys that are like, \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to find a way to win and in a seven-game series I\u2019m going to get the best of you in the end,\u201d\u2019 said Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler, who was with Philadelphia last season and saw up-close what makes Leonard tick. \u201dBut he\u2019s definitely up there. Your respect just grows. Push, pull, whatever he\u2019s got to do. \u2026 He\u2019s going to find a way.\u201d During the playoffs, Leonard\u2019s \u201dI\u2019m a fun guy\u201d quote that he offered on his arrival in Toronto became a meme and a marketing slogan. So did his \u201dBoard man gets paid\u201d line. And after the Raptors won the title, Serge Ibaka\u2019s video of Leonard went viral \u2013 they were in the back of a car, on the way to the parade, and Ibaka teed him up for the next unforgettable saying. \u201dFun Guy, what\u2019s up baby?\u201d Ibaka asked. The answer was classic Leonard. Short, sweet, to the point. \u201dI\u2019m playing to have fun and try to be the best player I can be,\u201d Leonard said. \u201dI\u2019m happy with myself and what I have done in my career and I\u2019m just going to keep on from there. It\u2019s not about me being famous or want to have more fame than those guys. It\u2019s about me playing basketball and having fun on the floor.\u201d"},{"id":29828,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-dec-27-edition-2019-20","date":"2019-12-27","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Jazz's turnaround coincides with Donovan Mitchell's arrival to MVP conversation","content":" Donovan Mitchell didn\u2019t get a chance to show out on Christmas because the Utah Jazz didn\u2019t get one of the coveted spots on the league\u2019s showcase day. So he had to handle his business the day after the holiday. And did he ever. Mitchell went off in a 121-115 win over the Portland Trail Blazers , scoring 28 of his 35 points after halftime, and reminding the world once again what he\u2019s capable of on the big stage. The Jazz have won six of seven games to climb back into the mix in the Western Conference playoff chase . They\u2019re now 8-1 this season when Mitchell scores 30 or more points. And he\u2019s crossed that threshold four times during Utah\u2019s current seven-game run. It\u2019s no coincidence that Mitchell\u2019s rise is coinciding with his team\u2019s turnaround. That combination and exquisite timing is why Mitchell is clawing his way into the mix on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder as the Jazz continue to make a power move in the standings. Mitchell is averaging career highs in scoring (25.1) and field goal percentage (45%) as the offensive catalyst for a team that requires every member of the team to play a very specific role on the defensive end of the floor with the reigning Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert, as their anchor. So it\u2019s not surprising to hear Mitchell was serious about the importance of the entire group when discussing what the Jazz are doing right in recent weeks. \u201cThe biggest thing is the resiliency, finding a way,\u201d he told reporters after the Jazz held off the Trail Blazers\u2019 late rally Thursday night courtesy of some clutch shot-making and two huge defensive plays by Gobert . \u201cThe mindset we\u2019ve had these past 6, 7 games is who we need to be. You can say what you want about my scoring or Joe but \u2026 it came down to Rudy making two good plays.\u201d For the Jazz to keep climbing and Mitchell to firmly entrench himself in this season\u2019s MVP conversation, it\u2019s going to come down to that and much more. * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * *  Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  30.5 points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.2 blocks Even the reigning Kia MVP is entitled to a tough night here and there. Giannis had his at the worst time, in a loss to the Sixers in Philadelphia on Christmas. He never could get comfortable with Al Horford and Joel Embiid doing as good a job defending him as anyone has all season. The guess is he won\u2019t miss 19 shots agains the Hawks tonight in Atlanta ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). Last week: No. 3 Season stats:  29.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.2 steals You couldn\u2019t tell Doncic had missed the Mavericks\u2019 past four games with a sprained ankle watching him work over the Spurs Thursday night. He got right back into his bag in his first game back, finishing with 24 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists as the Mavericks ran over the Spurs . They went 2-2 in Doncic\u2019s absence, proving they could survive without their leader. Last week: No. 4 Season stats:  38.1 points 7.5 assists, 5.8 rebounds, 1.9 steals Harden\u2019s been so good this season that the Warriors get credit for slowing him down on a night that saw him score 24 points on 50% shooting from the floor, 60% from deep, to go with 11 assists, six rebounds and three steals. It\u2019s easy to forget just how unbelievable Harden plays on a regular basis, mostly because his \u201coff nights\u201d are so far and few between.  Last week: No. 5 Season stats:  27.7 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 2.7 blocks, 1.4 steals Davis embraced the big stage in the Christmas showdown with the LA Clippers and showed why some people think he is the most dynamic two-way player in the league. But he didn\u2019t get nearly enough touches down the stretch of a tight game to finish what he started. If LeBron James misses time with a groin injury, you won\u2019t see that again anytime soon. Last week: No. 2 Season stats:  25.7 points, 10.6 assists, 7.6 rebounds, 1.2 steals Lakers fans are right to be nervous when they hear LeBron talk about aggravating a groin injury after taking a knee from Patrick Beverley in the loss to the Clippers on Christmas. This is the same time last season when a groin injury shook up his season, the Lakers sunk in his absence and never recovered.

Hindsight allows for a perspective that the moment simply does not. So instead of judging trades instantly, the end of the decade allows us an opportunity to look back and judge in hindsight the biggest trades of the decade and how they altered the NBA landscape in the moment, and for years to come.  MIA received: James and Bosh in sign-and-trade deals CLE received: Two future 1st-round Draft picks, two future 2nd-round picks TOR received: Two future 1st-round picks The Heat clearing the space to sign both James and Bosh while also keeping Wade (all at a discount, mind you) when each could have maxed out in free agency elsewhere, remains the greatest game-changing summer haul in league history. There have been busier total offseasons and huge names (Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, etc.) relocating in recent years, but nothing in the modern era compares to the Miami power move . This totally reset the course of league history for the Heat\u2019s three future Hall of Famers, as well as the rest of the league that had to deal with their combined efforts for four seasons. The Heat went 2-2 in The Finals during the Big 3 era, winning back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013. James won back-to-back Finals MVPs during the run; both Wade and Bosh saw their superstardom rise to another level. But the lasting effect would be the player empowerment movement it fueled in the years to come, a wave still going strong into the next decade.  NYK received: Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Renaldo Balkman and Sheldon Williams from Denver, as well as Corey Brewer from Minnesota DEN received:  Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari and Timofey Mozgov, as well as Kosta Koufos from Minnesota, along with a 1st-round pick, two 2nd-round picks and $3 million cash MIN received: Eddy Curry from New York, as well as Anthony Randolph from Minnesota and a 2nd-round pick That Anthony and the Knicks couldn\u2019t wait until free agency to unite remains a sore subject for some Knicks fans. The need to make sure they got him in what turned out to be a transformative period in free agency might have played a role, as did the presence of then-Nuggets coach George Karl. But there\u2019s no doubt the Knicks are still dealing with the fallout of having to portage so much of the roster to get Anthony to Madison Square Garden, where he spent seven seasons but never saw the sort of team success desired during his tenure. The Nuggets sustained and eventually rebuilt themselves with some of the assets gained in the deal (a 2016 pick-swap notably turned into Jamal Murray). The Minnesota portion of the deal was essentially a salary dump. Chris Paul to the LA Clippers   LAC received:  Paul NOH received:  Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and a 1st-round pick The big loser here was the Los Angeles Lakers, who had a deal ready to pair CP3 and Kobe Bryant in a superstar backcourt, only to see the deal spiked. The league owned the Hornets at the time and the original three-team deal was squashed for \u201cbasketball reasons.\u201d The Lob City Clippers were born in that moment. Paul joining a team that already featured Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan toying with the opposition above the rim proved an immediate hit. The Clippers went from a perennial doormat to a must-see outfit with an extremely bright future. With Paul at the controls, the Clippers made six straight playoff appearances and changed the culture of the organization along the way. They never reached the championship heights envisioned early on, but this era led the Clippers out of the darkness.  HOU received:  Harden, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward OKC received:  Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two 1st-round picks and a 2nd-round pick  When the Oklahoma City Thunder broke up their budding Big 3 of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden just after the trio led the Thunder to The Finals in 2012, no one was certain exactly what they\u2019d surrendered. Harden was a talent, but wasn\u2019t yet an All-Star. Instead, he was a player more known for his beard and Kia Sixth Man of the Year Award than anything else. But maybe Rockets GM Daryl Morey knew. Because by engineering a trade for Harden, he set the Rockets on a course for Western Conference contention for years to come. Harden has blossomed into one of the greatest scorers of this \u2014 or any \u2014 generation and the face of a franchise that was in desperate need of a new identity. The Thunder still had two future Kia MVPs to work with, but we\u2019ll never know what might have been had they stayed together. Brooklyn Nets go all-in for Garnett, Pierce   BOS received : Gerald Wallace, Kris Humphries, MarShon Brooks, Keith Bogans, and Kris Joseph, along with three 1st-round picks and one 1st-round pick swap BKN received : Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jason Terry, D.J. White This looks even worse in retrospect, with the Nets gambling away their immediate future Draft capital on aging champions Garnett, Pierce and Terry as the mayor components of a quick-fix title kit. Even with Joe Johnson and Deron Williams already in the fold, the Nets couldn\u2019t find the magic needed to be a true contender in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, Danny Ainge and his crew pulled of the heist for assets that would turn out to include Jaylen Brown (2016), Jayson Tatum (2017) and other youngsters who have allowed Ainge and the Celtics to not only become an Eastern Conference power, but also power broker in every Draft and trade season since the original deal was done. Ainge had the courage and the mastery of the craft to pull the trigger on a deal that changed the future of the franchise for the better.  CLE received:  Kevin Love MIN received:  Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Thaddeus Young, $6.3 million trade exception The lesson learned with this deal is that whatever LeBron James wanted, he was going to get in his return to his native northeast Ohio. Love was the piece he felt he needed to go along with All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving to lift the Cavaliers out of the lottery and back into contention in the Eastern Conference. And in the end, he was right. The Cavaliers knew then that former No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett was a bust. And for all of the hype surrounding Wiggins heading into the Draft that summer, Love was seen as a much better fit alongside LeBron given his experience and ability to stretch the floor and rebound at an elite level. For whatever drama that occurred during their time together, and there was plenty, the lasting images of the era will be of the Cavaliers going to four straight Finals and ending the city of Cleveland\u2019s 52-year championship drought. That 2016 title also came at the expense of the 73-win Golden State Warriors, which adds an extra source of pride for Cavaliers fans who suffered three other Finals defeats to the Warriors.  DAL received:  Doncic ATL received:  Young and protected 1st-round pick The third pick in the Draft, Doncic has already shown himself to be the best player in his class. He\u2019s midway through his sophomore season and is already a top three Kia MVP candidate and the heir to the throne Dirk Nowitzki occupied for years in Dallas. If his early returns are an accurate indication of what\u2019s to come, the Mavericks are in store for years of Doncic being one of the league\u2019s truly elite players for the foreseeable future. Young has been spectacular in his own right in Atlanta. And it remains to be seen what type of team the Hawks can build around him; Doncic joined a much sturdier group that he did. But the kicker in this deal for the Hawks was the additional top five pick they cashed in on in the 2019 Draft. Cam Reddish is having an up-and-down rookie season, which shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise. The ultimate grade for this deal won\u2019t be known for years, but it will rest mostly on the way Doncic and Young continue to evolve as stars on their respective sides of the conference divide. Kawhi Leonard to the Toronto Raptors   TOR received:  Leonard, Danny Green SAS received:  DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, protected 1st round pick This has to go down as one of the all-time great short-term gambles in league history. Raptors GM Masai Ujiri moved a franchise pillar in DeRozan to bring Leonard to The North for what turned out to be one magical, championship season with the Raptors. Leonard bounced in free agency, choosing the LA Clippers in the summer. But he was everything the Raptors needed and more in terms of an anchor star for their title season. Leonard was already a two-time Defensive Player of the Year and a Finals MVP, but his load management requirements during the regular season didn\u2019t provide a clear picture of just how good he and the Raptors would be when it mattered most. It\u2019s still hard to say what the deal has produced for the Spurs other than proof that they were right all along about Leonard, whom they traded George Hill to acquire in 2011. LAL received:  Anthony Davis NOP received:  Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart, as well as three 1st-round picks, a future 1st-round pick swap and cash considerations WAS received:  Mo Wagner, Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones, 1st round Draft pick Clearly the Lakers went into the offseason with the \u201cAD by any means necessary\u201d approach, because they gave up everything but the towels at the practice facility (and Kyle Kuzma) to acquire him. They shipped every other young asset procured during the Magic Johnson-Rob Pelinka administration to make it happen. AD with LeBron James meant an inset shift up in the Lakers\u2019 championship viability. Time will tell if they can finish the deal before Father Time catches up to LeBron. The Pelicans, already in possession of the No. 1 overall pick that would become Zion Williamson, had no choice but to deal Davis after he requested a trade earlier in the season. The fact that the deal was discussed for months took some of the shock out of it. But the magnitude of the deal for both sides will be felt for years to come, both the good and bad. Washington\u2019s service as the third team will be cashed in by the Wizards with that 1st round pick they picked up. Paul George to the Clippers along with Kawhi Leonard   LAC received:  George OKC received:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, three unprotected 1st-round Draft picks, a protected 1st-round pick and two 1st-round pick swaps. The record-setting package of Draft picks and players helped relocate the epicenter of power in the league from the Bay Area to Los Angeles. The Clippers made this deal at the request of Kawhi Leonard, who assumed his position as the most powerful man in a colossal free agent summer on the heels of his Finals MVP turn. The Clippers had to fight off their Staples Center roommates to secure Leonard\u2019s commitment, which came attached to their ability to manufacture and then maneuver a deal that would also bring George into the fold. With everything in place the Clippers assumed an unprecedented position in franchise history, entering the 2019-20 season as the favorites to win it all. With the deepest bench in the league, a championship coach in Doc Rivers, the richest owner in the league and now two superstars as headliners, the Clippers are in win-it-all-now mode until further notice. * * * Sekou Smith  is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He subbed out Hield with the Kings ahead 86-85 with 4:09 remaining in regulation. Sacramento lost the lead, then tied the game before both teams went scoreless over the final two minutes. Hield re-entered and promptly hit a 3-pointer to tie the game, 97-97, with one minute left in the first overtime. He was then subbed in and out before scoring the Kings\u2019 final five points; Sacramento ultimately fell by one. \u201cI didn\u2019t sit Buddy as punishment,\u201d Walton explained. \u201cI played the guys that had it going. They earned that right to finish that game and they got within striking distance. It wasn\u2019t a punishment at all.\u201d Hield, who finished with 17 points on 6-for-20 shooting, was not as willing to dismiss his absence from the final minutes of regulation. \u201cI feel like we should have won that game before (overtime) but I\u2019m not the coach,\u201d Hield observed. Hield figured to be a focal point of the Kings\u2019 future after signing a four-year, $86 million extension with Sacramento earlier this season. It was thought that he and fellow top-10 picks De\u2019Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley would help the franchise take the next step toward playoff contention after its encouraging 39-win campaign in 2018-19. Instead, the Kings have struggled with injuries and fluidity under Walton, whom the team hired in April to replace David Joerger. Hield\u2019s 3-point accuracy has fallen from 42.7 percent last season to 35.8 percent in 2019-20. Even with a 12-19 record, however, Sacramento is still just 1.5 games out of eighth place in the West. However the rest of the season plays out, Hield appears unwillingly resigned to endure whatever decisions Walton employs moving forward. \u201cIt is what it is, man,\u201d Hield said. \u201cThey have who they have playing out there and I just have to be supportive.\u201d"},{"id":29801,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-shot-clock-era-record-futility","date":"2019-12-27","title":"Nets set shot clock era record for futility","content":" Brooklyn entered Thursday\u2019s crosstown clash set to face a Knicks team with an interim head coach and a bottom-five defense.

When the day after Christmas was done, Brooklyn had polished off a putrid 21-for-78 (26.9 percent) shooting performance, the worst by any team since Orlando lost to Boston 87-56 in 2012. The Nets\u2019 performance was punctuated by just eight made two-point field goals: the fewest by any franchise since the shot clock was instituted in 1954. According to the Elias Sports Bureau , not since 1950 \u2014 when the Fort Wayne Pistons edged the Minneapolis Lakers 19-18 (not a typo!) \u2014 has a team made eight or fewer two-pointers.  Only two Nets players scored in double figures.

And, with any luck, these teams will run it back again as springtime gives way to summer. This suspenseful matchup between a pair of elites went to the wire Wednesday at Staples Center, proving to be exactly the gift the league needed on a day the NBA owns all to itself. And so, for roughy 2 1\/2 hours, this was LA-LA land, a territorial basketball fantasy with plenty of Kawhi Leonard, dashes of LeBron James and Anthony Davis and a Grinch-like pinch of Patrick Beverley. \u201cFor the regular season,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, \u201cthat was a very intense game. Both teams competed. There was no holding back. You like to see that.\u201d The final score was almost an afterthought, since it\u2019s just one game out of 82. But this counts, and the Clippers will take their 111-106 victory , savoring the moment while the Lakers deal with aftershocks. Some games on the schedule are more meaningful than others, even in the dead of winter, and this one had the suspicious scent and flavor of the playoffs. That\u2019s where the paths of these teams \u2014 currently jostling for pole position near the top of the West \u2014 are seemingly headed. For the moment, we\u2019re left with subplots, theories and conclusions about Lakers vs. Clippers that\u2019ll endure at least until the next time they meet and change the conversation all over again. 1. The Clippers are now 2-0 against the Lakers. They won the season opener without Paul George and this one without much from him. That\u2019ll stick in the Lakers\u2019 craw because until this tipoff, the Lakers had won 24 of 30 games and luxuriated in all the applause and bouquets thrown their way for such a rapid and prosperous start. And now, they must deal with the \u201cbut,\u201d as in \u201c\u2026 but they can\u2019t beat the Clippers, so how good are they, really?\u201d Keep in mind that while the Lakers and also the Bucks seemingly took control of the league, the Clippers dealt with George missing the first 11 games and Kawhi skipping games because of an achy knee that required rest \u2026 and still have managed to win 23 of their first 33. Rivers doesn\u2019t even know how good his team can be yet. Scary. 2. LeBron faltered when it counted. Sure, the stats were nice \u2014 23 points, 10 assists, nine rebounds; so close to another triple-double! \u2014 and he carried the Lakers for the majority of the fourth. But in the moments of truth, LeBron was shaky. He missed a free throw in the final minute, and trailing by three points on the Lakers\u2019 final possession, he isolated on Pat Bev, who gives away 6 inches and 60 pounds of muscle. And Pat Bev was the more aggressive and tenacious player in that contest, poking the ball away and off the hand of LeBron, giving the Clippers possession. This was the second time LeBron came up short against the Clippers; he vaporized late in the season opener as well. Just not a good look for one of the all-time greats \u2014 who otherwise has looked springy here in this 17th season. 3. Kawhi still rises to the occasion. For all the grief he\u2019s taken the last two years with load management and an avoidance of playing both games in back-to-backs, Kawhi is a man of the moment. He missed more than 20 games last season and muscled the Raptors to a championship. He\u2019s on a similar pace with the Clippers, and yet was easily the most impactful player on the floor Wednesday. Kawhi lets his play speak for him, and it screamed this: I want all the smoke that LeBron and the Lakers can muster. Whenever the Clippers needed a bucket, Kawhi isolated and gave them one, or drew fouls and went to the free-throw line. The damage was an efficient 35 points (making all eight free throws), 12 rebounds and chills sent through the Lakers. And keep in mind that, with Lou Williams suffering through a dreadful game and George missing 13 of his 18 shots, Kawhi was the Clippers\u2019 main option and still destroyed the double teams thrown his way. There\u2019s also this: Kawhi is 15-8 all-time against LeBron. 4. Pat Bev is a dog. And that\u2019s a compliment. Aside from his checking of LeBron in the final 20 seconds \u2014 and how about Rivers having the confidence to throw him on LeBron in that situation? \u2014 Pat Bev was all positive for the Clippers. He rang up a plus-26 for the game, was his usual pesky self defensively, and (just as he\u2019s done all season) was big on the glass, pulling down nine rebounds. That was three more than the 6-foot-10 Davis. 5. Kyle Kuzma announced his arrival for 2019-20. Sure, it\u2019s a few months late, yet better than never. After dealing with injury issues, missing Lakers training camp and taking time to round into form, Kuzma turned into a beast on Christmas. He gave the Clippers fits, especially early, dropping shots from deep, slicing to the rim and scoring 25 points in 27 minutes. Kuzma came into the game averaging nearly eight points fewer than he had last season. The performance provides relief to the Lakers, who are banking on Kuzma being that strong third player who can make a difference. Perhaps this marked a start. 6. The game itself was entertaining , even before Davis fell into the lap of comedian Kevin Hart after heaving a shot at the halftime buzzer. The entire Laker team got a kick out of that, and as they rushed over to retrieve Davis, playfully gave Hart the business. Unfortunately, that light moment with a 12-point lead would mark one of the last they could collectively smile about on the night. The Clippers ambushed the Lakers in the third quarter, made the game square, and simply outlasted and out-fought them in a tight fourth. Again, this is where Kawhi took over and LeBron ran out of gas. LeBron did take a painful and accidental knee from Beverley early in the game and fell to the floor momentarily, later suggesting it re-aggravated the groin injury that caused him to miss the previous game and made him questionable for this one. \u201cThat kind of set me back to where I was five days ago,\u201d LeBron said. How much it affected his performance, only LeBron knows. But this is real: He didn\u2019t attack the rim with regularity, attempting only four free throws. Some of that had to do with Rivers\u2019 strategy of placing Kawhi on LeBron early to discourage LeBron from driving. Also, the Clippers never panicked once the Laker lead swelled, what with Williams (1-for-6 shooting) and George firing blanks at the basket. Williams is usually a fourth-quarter player but was invisible, even missing a fast-break layup with Davis trailing on the play (he then kindly bailed out Williams with a gentle push that was whistled). \u201cWe were composed, kept fighting, and played one possession at a time,\u201d Kawhi said. Yes, this is true. For their ability to out-grind the Lakers, the Clippers secured the bragging rights and took their victory in stride. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anything for this,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cNo trophies or anything.\u201d Asked what the win meant in the big picture, beyond the holiday glow, George replied: \u201cNothing.\u201d To that end, the Clippers and Lakers came away from this game with common focus. Basketball fans and the NBA rejoiced for a night; the two teams involved choose to look forward. \u201cWe want to be the team holding the trophy,\u201d said Dwight Howard. \u201cWhen we do that, nobody will remember the game we lost on Christmas.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell  has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

With the infectious beat and lyrical melody from Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar blaring in the background, there is footage of various Clippers pumping iron, diving for loose balls, dunking on opponent\u2019s heads and mainly scowling. Lamar\u2019s hit song is \u201cDNA\u201d and so you can see why the Clippers chose it, to demonstrate that this has been, and will continue to be, the fiber for this hard-working team all season. Oh, but there\u2019s more: There are curious subtitles running across the screen in all caps: \u201cDriven Over Given\u201d and \u201cStreet Lights Over Spotlights\u201d and \u201cSquad Over Self\u201d and finally, \u201cLA Our Way.\u201d Is this a clap at the more glamorous Lakers, whose style and persona have long reflected their brand and star-power? It certainly appears so, that the Clippers, fortified by the low-watt additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and smug about their lofty place in the NBA atmosphere, were marking their territory in town, which obviously conflicts with the more famous purple and gold Goliaths who share the same arena. Until the Clippers and Lakers play a more meaningful game than their Christmas Day tip, and it appears their journeys will make that possible come springtime, a sly video must do for now in terms of generating heat between the LA clubs. That is, unless something devilish happens in their regular-season contests, and whenever Pat Beverley\u2019s on the court, mayhem is possible. Well, there\u2019s also this, when Clippers coach Doc Rivers jabbed LeBron James recently over comments about load management: \u201cIt\u2019s our philosophy. I don\u2019t know what theirs are. I think theirs is whatever LeBron says it is.\u201d OK, then. The good news for LA fans, and by extension all basketball fans, is the Clippers and Lakers are busy fighting for space at the top of the West right now, with no sign of easing up anytime soon. More to the point, they\u2019ve never been this good at the same time and in the same season. What this means is LA vs. LA is the inevitable atmosphere we all thought would happen this season and could produce some energetic moments every time they meet. The season opener two months ago had a similar vibe, yet was remembered mostly for a segment of Lakers fans booing Kawhi as he took the microphone to usher in the Clippers\u2019 home opener. Otherwise: The Clippers without George ambushed the Lakers and applied the defensive clamps in the final quarter for the win. Here on Christmas, the atmosphere is a bit amped up: Both teams are fully healthy; the Clippers for the first time all season and the Lakers for only the second time. Which means, there\u2019s a good chance the performance on the floor will turn spicy and overwhelm the ho-humish attitude expressed by players and coaches on both teams about this potentially but not yet blooming \u201crivalry.\u201d As Dwight Howard, reborn here in his second stint with the Lakers, said: \u201cThis is not an ego test for us. We\u2019re not trying to see who\u2019s better right now. We want to make sure come playoff time that we\u2019re the best team going into the playoffs and at the end of the playoffs, we\u2019re the best team in the world. That\u2019s our goal. That should be our mindset. We can\u2019t allow emotions to get in the way of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. I think we were super emotional during the first game and it showed. We can\u2019t play with our emotions. We have to play with our will and our purpose. And if we do that, then we should win the game.\u201d Basketball history in LA has been dramatically one-sided; with the exception of the brief Chris Paul and Blake Griffin-fueled \u201cLob City,\u201d the Clippers have never gained any traction since moving up the I-5 freeway from San Diego four decades ago. If nothing else, many Clippers-Lakers games in the past were essentially Lakers home games, based on the noise from the seats and the result on the floor. Lakers lapses were short and confined to the years immediately after \u201cShowtime\u201d and when Kobe Bryant got old. Otherwise, the franchise took advantage of its rich history and the charms of Los Angeles to attract star players and remain relevant. The Clippers? Poor basketball decisions plus a wacky owner meant a dreadful existence, and the entertainment they mainly supplied was unintentional comedy. But now, this: Both teams are bringing a pair of legitimate stars each, with two of the four championship-tested, along with a swell of solid support and steep expectations. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good position,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of growth ahead of us and everybody knows that. We\u2019re able to win games and got a good group of guys. And the Lakers are still not where they want to be, either.\u201d They engaged in a tug-of-war over Kawhi last summer, with the Clippers winning out for the two-time Finals MVP and thus denying the Lakers a potential dynasty, not that a LeBron-Anthony Davis duo can\u2019t pull off multiple championships if all goes well. Since the season-opening loss to the Clippers, the Lakers hit their stride rapidly and awesomely, ripping through a stretch where they won 24 of 26. This was made possible by LeBron and Davis developing a bond on the floor right away, rather than dealing with a feeling-out process that\u2019s more in common with these star unifications. LeBron in particular has looked springy in his 17th season by leading the league in assists while scoring and rebounding in gulps whenever the Lakers need his supply. He\u2019s one of the front-runners for early MVP notice and, should he remain healthy \u2014 he has only missed one game \u2014 will give Giannis Antetokounmpo a run for the award. Also, until very recently, the Lakers\u2019 defense has been sharp; defense was a priority at the start for new coach Frank Vogel and the players are buying his philosophy. Howard, Davis and JaVale McGee give the Lakers a trio of long and instinctive defenders ruling the paint. \u201cThe diversity of our offense is the biggest difference for us,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cOur arsenal is more developed than it was opening night.\u201d And yet: Kyle Kuzma, averaging just 11.3 points, is still rounding into form after a foot injury this summer while playing for Team USA, but the silver lining is when he finally gets right, the Lakers can be even better than they are now. The Clippers are in a similar situation; George missed the first 11 games of the season and Kawhi, wary of an ongoing aching knee, has missed nine games and yet the Clippers are just three games behind the Lakers in the standings. The Clippers haven\u2019t suited up everyone in their rotation until now. Which means: They haven\u2019t realized their full potential, and the season\u2019s over one-third old. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we have yet,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cI knew it would be a process because of the way we started the season with guys out. I thought we\u2019d struggle a little more, so I guess I\u2019m happy where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re in a very good place. Kawhi had half a training camp. PG missed all of camp. Today was actually the first day we had all our guys at practice, so that was nice. It\u2019s tough to have new guys and they don\u2019t go through camp at all. There\u2019s no continuity. \u201cYou look at the Lakers and how fast they started and that\u2019s a team that looks like it went through camp with all their guys. We\u2019re not that.\u201d Still, the Clippers are 10-3 when George and Kawhi are on the floor, and 14-2 at Staples. Along with Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, the Clippers have four players averaging roughly 20 points each, unheard of in the NBA. Their weakness so far is turnovers and the absence of a rim protector; they can fix the first one and live with the second one. Essentially, neither LA team is putting special emphasis on the regular season. Their ego and their talent is telling them it doesn\u2019t matter where they finish among the top eight in the standings; once the postseason begins, all that counts is their health and rhythm. \u201cWe are both in town, we see each other and so that creates its own rivalry whether the teams are good or bad,\u201d Rivers said. The winner, no matter what happens between the Lakers and Clippers, is Los Angeles. It\u2019s the heartbeat of the NBA right now, and that will be evident on Christmas, where Lakers vs. Clippers are clearly the marquee. They share an arena and a city. But come summer, there\u2019s only room for one of them \u2014 assuming, of course, that LA is still in play by then. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam is out with an injury but Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker is already on the list for the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder . It\u2019s Walker\u2019s two young teammates, however, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who are poised to steal the spotlight on this day. They are playing lights out heading into the big day and they are both back on the trajectory they were before last season\u2019s Kyrie Irving experience interrupted things. The Celtics have moved up into the top three of John Schuhmann\u2019s Week 10 Power Rankings on the strength of Tatum and Brown surging at the same time. Tatum dropped a career-high 39 points against Charlotte Sunday and is averaging 29.7 points on 51% shooting over his last three games, all Boston wins. And Brown is averaging 22.7 points on 53% shooting over that same span. They should both be in consideration for Eastern Conference All-Star honors this season and much more in the years to come. So while we await word on the status of some of the other key players on Wednesday\u2019s schedule, know that the future will be on display. Make sure you tune in early! Trade Season : So it begins. The Dante Exum experience in Utah ends with his trade to Cleveland for Jordan Clarkson. This is also the official kickoff of trade season, which usually brings a few interesting twists to the season. With so much emphasis on the free agent summer of 2021, most of the scouts and front office executives queried so far this season seem to think things will be unusually quiet on the trade front. As for Exum, who has battled injuries throughout his career, he joins a crowded group of young backcourt performers in need of the player development that John Beilein and his staff can provide. Clarkson, meanwhile, returns to the Western Conference and the playoff chase with the Jazz, who like every other team in the league is always on the lookout for a boost in its wing rotation. Welcome Back: First it was DeAndre Ayton making his long-awaited return from suspension for the Phoenix Suns. And now it\u2019s John Collins, who has finally found his way back to the Hawks\u2019 rotation after serving his 25-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s anti-drug policy. Collins wasted no time getting back to his high-flying ways , but is it too late for the Hawks and their own MVP, Trae Young, to salvage this season? We\u2019ll see. But having Collins back in the mix certainly helps the cause. Player(s) of the Week : Here\u2019s a Christmas surprise for you. Kyle Lowry and Dennis Schroder winning Eastern and Western Conference Player of the Week honors, respectively, in the lead up to the league\u2019s holiday showcase. It\u2019s a well-deserved honor for two guards who have played significant roles in their respective teams making some surprising noise in the standings to this point . None of us really knew what to expect from Lowry and the Raptors after Kawhi Leonard vacated the premises after last season\u2019t title run. And Schroder and the Thunder weren\u2019t given much thought after both Paul George and Russell Westbrook were traded away over the summer. Both the Raptors and Thunder go into the holiday in a great spot in the standings, much more prominent spaces than any of the pundits predicted. Take that for data!. Now, let\u2019s get into your comments about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  SpotOn96057010 Dec. 21, 2019 | 12:55 a.m. Overall good names there, bad order I\u2019m getting used to some NBA patterns. Luka been snubbed over and over. LeBron getting priced for past achievements and good tempering last summer. Giannis Luka Harden AD LeBron I took away points for tempering and past years achievements. * * * My response: The notion that LeBron is being rewarded for past achievements spits in the eye of the work he\u2019s doing right now with the Lakers. Even on the heels of their three-game losing streak , LeBron is balling out this season just days away from his 35th birthday and in his 17th season in the league. There\u2019s no need to artificially inflate what\u2019s going on with LeBron. The proof is in his performance. From:  Maurice Nicholson Dec. 23, 2019 | 7:28 p.m. Spencer Dinwiddie? What\u2019s the rationale? Spencer has been carrying the Nets since Kyrie went down. Better numbers, and a better record. Give the man his props. * * * My response: Dinwiddie has played his tail off since Kyrie Irving went down and you are right Maurice, he deserves his props. That will be reflected in the next Ladder after Christmas. From:  Bball__Fanatic Dec. 20, 2019 | 4:54 p.m. It\u2019s Giannis, Harden, Luka, Bron, AD * * * My response: I understand any argument made for James Harden. He\u2019s an absolute offensive machine and is flirting with rarified air, averaging close to 40 points per game this season. And if the MVP matrix was strictly about how many points a guy scores, he\u2019d definitely be at the top of the list. But a scoring title and a Kia MVP are two very different things. Harden\u2019s locked in on one and certainly in the mix for the other one.  From: Luke Zwayne Dec. 20, 2019, 12:51 p.m. Hi Sekou! My name\u2019s Luke (you included my email in the last MVP ladder mailbag ), Last week you asked me to share my version of the ladder so here it is: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Lebron James 3. Luka Doncic 4. James Harden 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Anthony Davis 7. Pascal Siakam 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Kemba Walker 10. Paul George As you can see, I put Jimmy Butler in the number five spot over AD. Here\u2019s the key word: \u201cValuable.\u201d I believe Jimmy is more \u201cvaluable\u201d to the heat than Davis is to the Lakers. I mean, we are taking about the \u201cKia Most Valuable Player\u201c award aren\u2019t we? Jimmys value is in every aspect of the game: passing, scoring, defense. He seems to be the heart beat of the team in all of these areas. Though Anthony Davis has a major impact on both ends of the floor, Lebron is the one calling the shots and playing the role of \u201ccaptain.\u201d So what I\u2019m saying is that Jimmy Butler has that Dame Lillard, CP3, Lebron James leadership, floor general, \u201cwin at all costs\u201d mentality and I\u2019m loving it! Thanks again Sekou! Merry Christmas and happy holidays! * * * My response:  Thanks again Luke. I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate for the rest of us. And Happy Holidays to you and yours. The emphasis you placed on Jimmy Butler is warranted. He\u2019s playing his role to perfection in Miami. He\u2019s the All-Star anchor and face of the franchise Pat Riley hoped he would be when the Heat put their free agent fortunes in him over the summer. Both sides clearly did their homework in researching each other and making sure it would be a good fit. But I have to imagine what they\u2019ve done thus far is above and beyond anyone\u2019s wildest expectations. From: Konstantinos Politis Dec. 18, 2019 | 7:14 a.m. Dear Mr. Sekou, First of all, we would like to say that you are doing amazing work with the MVP Ladder list. We are Kostas Politis & Michael Roussis from Athens, Greece. As we read the mailbags, we realize that most of the fans losing the point and the reason of winning the MVP trophy. If anyone search the stats, everything is clear. MVP trophy goes to Most Valuable Player, which means that we should check a combination of things to set an MVP list (Ranks: Team, Stats), not only the points. Some players have outstanding numbers as individuals (e.g. James Harden) but his team (Houston Rockets) is 5th in the West and 9th among all the teams in NBA, based on PCT percentage. Based on season stats, we represent our top 5 list (until now): 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (PER: 34.65, 1st in NBA | his team: 1st in NBA | 85.7% PCT) 2. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks (PER: 32.01, 2st in NBA | his team: 6th in NBA | 69.2% PCT ) 3. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers (PER: 29.43, 4th in NBA | his team: 1st in NBA | 85.7% PCT) 4. James Harden, Houston Rockets (PER: 31.67, 3rd in NBA | his team: 9th in NBA | 66.7% PCT) 5. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers (PER: 26.90 6th in NBA | his team: 1st in NBA | 85.7% PCT) PER:  Player Efficiency Rating PCT:  Winning Percentage The figures based on ESPN & NBA stats. Thanks for your time. Greetings from Greece. Yours sincerely, Kostas & Michael * * * My response: Greetings my Greek friends and thanks for weighing in from the other side of the world. While NBA.com \u2018s analytics guru John Schuhmann is always my first call on these matters, I trust your work in this case. The slight differences in your order and mine doesn\u2019t mean one is more accurate than the other. And as I continue to hammer home as often as possible, the order on anyone\u2019s MVP Ladder will be heavily influenced by the components one deems most valuable. If you prioritize the analytics or whatever you use, it\u2019s coloring your perception of the MVP conversation. And we welcome all opinions around here.  From: tim lizaso Dec. 18, 2019 | 8:36 a.m. Hi Sekou, Good day. Im a fan and avid reader of your article, this takes me off from the wild season game stories and updates into focusing on players who are doing their best and excel. I saw in your article, maybe last week? That you were considering a list for the sixth man ladder which was suggested by another fan. I immediately thought, why not also talk about defensive player ladder and talk about their significant value(s) on their team. I think defensive players have an edge (in overall team value) have specific contributions than other players that are labeled as role players and or fillers. These are just thoughts and I think I just give it a shot and mention this to you. Thank you and keep it coming. Tim from the Philippines * * * My response:  Tim, shout out to you and all the NBA fans in the Philippines. I know how passionate you all are about the game and believe me when I tell you, it\u2019s appreciated. I agree that we don\u2019t spend nearly as much time as needed on the league\u2019s elite defensive players and the impact they make on their teams in particular and the game overall. It\u2019s not the sexy part of basketball for many (people like 3-pointers, dunks and offensive highlights more, what can I say?). But any list of the league\u2019s top individual defenders has to include the reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and my personal favorite perimeter defensive agitator (sorry Pat Bev) Marcus Smart. Since I\u2019ve already got more than enough on my plate with the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, I\u2019ll leave this defensive list up to you. Have at it! From: Jon Christensen Dec. 18, 2019 | 10:35 a.m. Hey Sekou, Thanks for your great commenting on NBA TV first of all. But I think there is one important piece missing in the top 5 mix for the MVP race. Jimmy Butler has been on an absolute tear. From all the question marks around him from his time in Minnesota, to just coming up short to Toronto in the playoffs, people had discredited him as not being an all-star. Now this year, he has a legitimate case to be on the starting roster as SF for the eastern conference all star team. While his shooting percentages are not fantastic, and 21 ppg is a little lackluster for an MVP candidate, he has been better for them than what the stat sheets say. He has not only reinvented himself as even MORE of a do it all kind of guy, but he has turned that Miami Heat team into a legit contender in the Eastern Conference. Of course Bam\u2019s development along with their rookies has helped but Jimmy has been the glue, and I\u2019m not sure if they are even a 6 or 7 seed without him. I just think the narrative surrounding him this year has not been talked about enough and he has put up some good numbers alongside the effort you see from him on both sides of the ball. So my top 5 is as follows. 1.Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Lebron James 3. Luka Doncic (Barring his injury doesn\u2019t leave him out for too long) 4. James Harden 5. Jimmy Butler Thanks, Jon Christensen * * * My response: I appreciate the kind words, Jon. Jimmy isn\u2019t necessarily missing from the mix (he\u2019s parked just outside of the top five on the most recent Ladder), he\u2019s tapping on the glass trying to get in. He deserves credit, as I mentioned above, for lifting the fortunes of the Heat and their entire group with his play and leadership this season. Stay tuned to see where he fits this week. From: Fikri Avci Dec. 18, 2019 | 11:34 a.m. Dear Sekou, I couldn\u2019t help notice your effort\/desire with doing a fair job and yet making everyone happy (including the superstar players with influence!) and came up with a formula to justify an MVP rank that would make most if not everyone happy. Here is the formula: Efficiency per 48 minutes (x) Win% (of the team the player plays for) + Narrative factor (scale of 1-10) There is more\u2026 Only players in teams >0.65 Win% qualifies to enter into this formula. And one more..the narrative factor that you and others always talk about: This is for you to give your flavor to the rankings from a scale of 1 to 10. And one last: You can use the team\u2019s Win% for the games the player actually played to reflect the player\u2019s impact more accurately. You can also exclude from the ranking players that played less than 75% of the team\u2019s games. Below is the rankings minus (-) the Narrative factor. I didn\u2019t went down in the Eff rankings to generate this list. Some players from high Win% teams may pop up if you reach below in Eff rankings. And the narrative factor is all yours to add human touch:) Aren\u2019t you surprised that the top five players in this list are the usual suspects at your lists! All you need to do do is add your narrative factor and explain this to your readers ( team is new, the coach is new, player is achieving these at a young age, at an old age, clutch shots, wizard in defense\/offense, without him the team sucks.. etc etc). Best, Fikri * * * My response:  Just so you know, Fikri, I gave up on making everyone happy a long time ago. I simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to please everyone, not with so many competing interests in the MVP conversation. But every bit of constructive criticism helps. Your formula makes a ton of sense. There\u2019s so much quality data analysis involved in the game these days that you have to consider all sources. And I\u2019m glad all of the names you have listed can be found on the Ladder somewhere. We\u2019re on the same page, even if we\u2019re not exactly perfectly aligned. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Winners of five straight entering Monday night, the Jazz traded former fifth overall pick Dante Exum to Cleveland in exchange for veteran combo guard Jordan Clarkson . Utah will also send two second-round picks in the deal. Utah had signed Exum to a three-year, $33 million contract last summer, but injuries continue to plague the 6-foot-5 guard\u2019s career. The Australian native has played just 67 total regular season games over the last three years, and has seen his backup point guard role entrusted to Emmanuel Mudiay. Clarkson steps in as a healthier alternative after having missed just five total games over the previous four seasons. Still just 27 years old, Clarkson is averaging 14.6 points while shooting 37.1 percent from 3-point range, further strengthening the most accurate 3-point-shooting team in the league. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, will add Exum to a core of young guards seeking to fulfill their potential.

( 8 ET, ESPN\/ABC ). Leonard should be ready to go after a couple days of rest following a Sunday loss in Oklahoma City. James\u2019 status is uncertain, though, after he suffered a strained thoracic muscle last week that kept him out of the Lakers\u2019 128-104 loss Sunday to the Denver Nuggets. Here\u2019s a closer look at that and a few more matchups you shouldn\u2019t miss: * * * Last regular season meeting: Oct. 22, 2019 Leonard closed last week by returning to San Antonio for just the third time since leaving the Spurs via a trade in 2018. He also won at AT&T Center for the first time as a visitor behind 26 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and four steals in just 27 minutes of near-surgical precision. Clippers coach Doc Rivers said \u201cit was the sharpest I\u2019ve ever seen him,\u201d which would seem to bode well for a matchup against James. He played in two games with a thoracic muscle strain before the Lakers listed him doubtful for Sunday\u2019s loss to the Nuggets. In their first matchup of 2019-20, Leonard got the better of James as the Clippers won 112-102 in the season-opener for both teams. Leonard finished with 30 points on 10-for-19 shooting while also adding six rebounds, five assists and two steals. James had a near triple-double in that game (18 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists) as the two stars guarded each other for about 2 minutes apiece . (Danny Green guarded Leonard the most on Oct. 22 , while Mo Harkless guarded LeBron the most for the Clippers.) Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Dec. 18, 2019 Ten days after the Heat handed Philadelphia its first home loss of the season , the 76ers face Miami on the road. The teams are 1-1 in their season series, but the last game featured some drama involving Simmons and Nunn, who scored a game-high 26 points in that win. Tobias Harris hit a 3-pointer for Philadelphia with 25.5 seconds remaining to make the score 106-104, and Nunn subsequently missed a pair of free throws with Simmons coming up with the rebound. He advanced the ball and opted out of what appeared to be a prime shot to drive to the rack against Nunn to tie the game. Instead of attacking, Simmons dished to Al Horford, who missed an open 3 from the wing \u2014 a decision Simmons took some heat for. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Jan. 18, 2019  Trade rumors involving Holiday led to Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin explaining in an in-game interview last week the team is \u201cclearly not\u201d looking to move Holiday. With that pressure off Holiday, he can focus on what\u2019s proven to be a formidable foe in Lillard (who has won three straight games vs. the Pelicans\u2019 guard). The last time these two met, Lillard lit up New Orleans for 41 points . With the Pelicans dropping 14 of their last 15, things don\u2019t ease up here. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 18, 2019  Kia MVP candidate Luka Doncic hasn\u2019t played since spraining his right ankle on Dec. 14 , but his absence has paved the way for Porzingis to recapture his game. Porzingis has logged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in four of his last five games and his four-game run of 20-10 efforts from Dec. 14-20 was the first such string of his career. He faces a familiar foe in Aldridge, who had won three straight matchups until Nov. 18, when the Porzingis posted 18 points and 10 rebounds in a 117-110 win. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Feb. 21, 2019 Horford and Antetokounmpo waged some competitive battles when the former played for the Boston Celtics. In those outings, Horford and Antetokounmpo fought to a 7-7 series tie. Horford and his current team, the Philadelphia 76ers, are 5 1\/2 games behind the Bucks in the East standings . The last time Antetokounmpo and Horford squared off, the reigning Kia MVP had 30 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 11, 2019 Two bright, young, star point guards of the future in the same division go head-to-head for the second time this season. But this time around, you should expect much better stats from these players. In the first meeting, Murray was playing on a minutes restriction, which has since been lifted. Morant was still adjusting to life in the NBA in just his ninth career game. Murray is one of the league\u2019s better defenders, and you\u2019d think his length would give Morant trouble until you check out this clip and realize the Grizzlies\u2019 youngster can fly.

Another monster night for Harden?  Over his last 11 games, James Harden has scored 40 or more five times \u2014 including a 47-point game Saturday against the Suns . Since Thanksgiving, he\u2019s averaging 40.5 ppg , ranks third in the league in clutch points (32) and, lest you think he\u2019s all about scoring, ranks fourth in deflections (46) and seventh in loose balls recovered (18). He\u2019s doing it all as you can tell and the Kings\u2019 17th-ranked defense is next up ( 10 ET, League Pass ) in the task of trying to slow him down. 2. Pacers, Raptors set to square off Any doubts about Toronto\u2019s ability to hold up in the face of injuries was proven otherwise over the weekend as the Raptors nipped the Wizards and notched an epic comeback vs. the Mavs . The Pacers are essentially healthy, but went out with a whimper Sunday in Milwaukee . Both teams are scrapping to stay in the East\u2019s upper playoff crust as they meet ( 7 ET, NBA TV ). Rebounding could play a big part in this one: both squads are in the bottom 10 in Rebounding Percentage this month despite Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis ranking fifth in rebounds per game this month (14.0 rpg). 3. Are the Jazz truly improving? Win streaks aren\u2019t always proof of success in the NBA, and Utah may be a case study in that. The Jazz have won five in a row, but none of those wins have come against winning teams. In fact, their last win vs. a team currently over .500 came on Nov. 12 vs. Brooklyn . A road game with the Heat ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) might validate the win streak Utah has been on. Joe Ingles\u2019 playmaking has been key in Utah\u2019s success: he\u2019s averaging 6.2 apg this month , which is nearly two assists more per game than what injured point guard Mike Conley is averaging this season . 4. Reinforcements for Atlanta The Hawks got off to a 2-3 start through Halloween and had some (then-)realistic hopes of perhaps a playoff run. Then things came crashing down as big man John Collins was issued a 25-game suspension after testing positive for a growth hormone. Atlanta has gone 4-21 since then, but the big man is back tonight vs. Cleveland ( 7 ET, League Pass ). Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce isn\u2019t putting unnecessary pressure on Collins to save the season, but Atlanta will no doubt be glad to have his 17 points and 8.8 rebounds per game back in the mix. 5. Nuggets can\u2019t overlook Suns Denver came up big against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday and essentially rolled past them for their sixth straight win. A showdown with the Suns ( 9 ET, League Pass ) is a decided mismatch on paper given that Phoenix will be without Deandre Ayton (and may not have Ricky Rubio, either). But remember that Denver had a six-game win streak working in late November only to blow a 17-point lead in an OT loss to the struggling Kings. To date in December, the Suns are allowing the fourth-most points in the paint , a stat that should favor the Nuggets\u2019 Paul Millsap and Nikola Jokic. 6. Taking stock of Anthony, Portland Sixteen games into their time together, the Blazers and Carmelo Anthony have amassed a 9-6 mark and are in the midst of a four-game win streak.

Then again, Brogdon isn\u2019t missed at all. From a personal standpoint, seeing Brogdon back in town Sunday with his new team, the Indiana Pacers, was a happy reunion with a players who was integral to the Bucks\u2019 conference finals breakthrough a year ago. There were warm moments before and after the game, a tribute video and a standing ovation , and the sort of ruthless ribbing in which only the tightest of friends can engage. For instance, Milwaukee\u2019s George Hill, on his way in, pounced on Brogdon\u2019s new mustachioed look the instant he saw him in the hallway. \u201cIt\u2019s a good look for Malcolm,\u201d center Brook Lopez said later, more generous in his review. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people could do it, but he does a great job with it and wears it with great confidence. \u201cI wish him utmost success. As long as he\u2019s happy, he\u2019s doing great on the court, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Brogdon, widely considered one of the NBA\u2019s top offseason acquisitions for his impact thus far with the Pacers, has been playing with confidence too, same as he did for three seasons with the Bucks. Reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo thought it might take Brogdon (who was hurt when the teams met in Indianapolis last month) longer to master the role Indiana handed to him when they executed the sign-and-trade deal worth $85 million over four seasons to land the restricted free agent. Carrying a team, heavy usage on the ball, leading Indiana in scoring \u2013 all of that has come quickly, surprising no one less than Brogdon himself. \u201cThis has been something that every respected NBA player wants,\u201d the 27-year-old said before tipoff. \u201cThey want a team [where] they can still win at a high level but they have the ball more in their hands and they can control more of the game.\u201d Said Antetokounmpo, \u201cObviously, you can see, he got a lot better. His space is great, he\u2019s finding his teammates real well and I think the game has slowed down even more for him.\u201d Despite so much goodwill and sentiment framing the game for Brogdon and his former teammates, the reunion turned into just another ruthless night at the office for the Bucks. Brogdon shot poorly in the first half, but Indiana was within 59-55 at the break. Then the home team stiffened. It limited the Pacers to 4-of-17 shooting through the first 10 minutes of the third quarter, opening a lead that bloated to 21 points. In the fourth, five different Bucks drained deep 3s on consecutive possessions and soon, Milwaukee had a 117-89 win. Brogdon finished with 10 points and 10 assists, but managed only four and two after halftime. As valuable as he was last season \u2014 averaging 15.6 points while hitting that rare 40\/50\/90 mark in field goal, 3-point and free throw accuracy \u2014 it\u2019s been hard to find the void he was supposed to have left in Milwaukee\u2019s play. There still are critics who think the Bucks signed the wrong point guard when they pre-empted Eric Bledsoe\u2019s free agency with a four-year, $70 million extension last March. Brogdon\u2019s consistency argued on his behalf, and his superior shooting was a better fit with Antetokounmpo. Still, Bledsoe was an All-NBA defender last season and Milwaukee\u2019s clear third option offensively after Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, at a preseason media session, said re-signing Brogdon would have been a \u201cluxury.\u201d Brogdon figured, once Bledsoe got his deal, that his Milwaukee days were numbered. \u201cI would have loved to play for this team,\u201d Brogdon admitted Sunday . \u201cIf they wanted me. If they had valued me the way the Pacers valued me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say.\u201d That\u2019s where this is looking \u2014 for now \u2014 like a win-win with little regret. Brogdon likes his contract, his new team and his role. The Bucks, meanwhile, are 27-4, holders of the best record in the NBA and tied with the 1970-71 championship squad for the best start in franchise history. The throttling of the Pacers was Milwaukee\u2019s eighth victory by 20 points or more this season. Coach Mike Budenholzer got his 300th career win and the team now has sold out a record 50 straight home games. With second-year wing Donte DiVincenzo taking a big step this season \u2014 he has been starting while Bledsoe recovers from a right shin fracture \u2014 and veteran Wesley Matthews handling 3-and-D duties, the Bucks have papered over Brogdon\u2019s absent contributions. They also used some of what might have been his money to add Matthews, Robin Lopez and Kyle Korver to this season\u2019s roster. Budenholzer said management liked the \u201cgood, young wings\u201d who were ready for greater workloads, including DiVincenzo, Pat Connaughton and Sterling Brown. Lopez talked about how they\u2019re getting a lot of what Brogdon did then \u201cby committee\u201d now. Said Hill: \u201cWe knew losing Malcolm was a big punch. But we have guys like Donte, Wes, myself, and other guys coming in filling up roles.\u201d It\u2019s early, of course, and way too soon to make pronouncements for a Bucks team whose success will be determined by whether they play past May. If they don\u2019t, it could wind up easy in hindsight to point to a playoff game or three where Brogdon\u2019s particular brand of impact was fatally lacking. But not now. He is thriving in Indy, even as the Bucks keep powering on. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But that place didn\u2019t exist during the 2019 offseason, according to the former Kia Rookie of the Year. Instead, Brogdon left the 60-win Bucks for the up-and-coming Pacers via a sign-and-trade deal \u2014 one made easier by the $85 million contract Indiana offered. On Sunday, Brogdon returned to Milwaukee for the first time. What would have happened had the Bucks kept Brogdon is a moot point in his eyes. \u201cI would\u2019ve loved to play for this team, if they had wanted me,\u201d Brogdon told reporters before the Pacers\u2019 eventual 117-89 loss . \u201cIf they had valued me the way the Pacers value me.

The former second-round pick is averaging 18.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 7.6 assists per game, all career-highs. Brogdon missed the final 12 games of last year\u2019s regular season and the first eight playoff games with a torn plantar fascia in his right foot. He did not return until Game 5 of the second round against Boston, but proceeded to play a vital role for the Bucks before they ultimately fell to Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals.

It could be the car you drive, the insurance that covers it, the lotion you slather, the breakfast or lunch you\u2019re eating, the doorbell you\u2019re ringing, the soda you\u2019re drinking, the relief for the pain you\u2019re feeling or the vacation you\u2019re planning. And what\u2019s more, based on every industry metric, you\u2019re definitely buying the idea of an ex-player the size of a small planet whose bank is approaching a cool half billion \u2014 if it\u2019s not already there \u2014 relating to the everyday needs and desires of you, Joe Ordinary. Shaq retired from the NBA eight years ago but gets more air time than LeBron James from liftoff to rim. His commercials almost run into each other. It is, quite simply, one of the more remarkable recent developments in the NBA universe, how Shaq has managed a sports monopoly on product endorsements which includes but is not limited to working alongside a small cartoonish military man who comes up to Shaq\u2019s kneecaps. Yes, let\u2019s all go for a ride with the General \u2026 in a Buick, of course. With a Shaq rap mixtape blasting from the speakers. Shaq is qualified to appear on both TNT and CNBC. In fact, the business TV talking heads haven\u2019t been this worked up over an NBA personality since mid-1990s Michael Jordan at \u201cSpace Jam\u201d heights. Their estimates say Shaq, to date, has endorsed roughly 50 companies in his lifetime. Shaq\u2019s current rotation is diverse and wide-ranging and very willing to make him the face of the product through commercials where Shaq, quite obviously, swallows up the screen. And to answer your next question, yes, Shaq gets a piece of the action of some companies and multiple franchises of others, in addition to drawing a check. \u201cIt\u2019s really something I can\u2019t explain,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because of my reputation or recognition or how I conduct business. We get a lot of opportunities.\u201d Although the evidence might argue against it, Shaq says he doesn\u2019t take every offer and is actually picky about which companies to represent. He also lives by a few business rules. One: The product must be affordable to the average consumer. Two: He must believe in the product and use it himself. Three: The commercials must bring laughter. Product endorsement is a tricky game that\u2019s only mastered by a lucky few celebrities, and even fewer athletes. First and foremost, the person must be identifiable and likable, free of controversy and scandal and the audience must warm up to him or her. In that sense, Shaq obviously registers, if only because he\u2019s hard to miss. He\u2019s robust in size and personality, crossing racial, gender and generational lines. While Shaq does have his own social and political thoughts and stances, \u201cI keep it friendly and respectful to all people.\u201d The business and marketing industry is religiously tied to someone\u2019s Q-rating, a tool used for over 50 years that measures familiarity and appeal, to decide who\u2019s worthy. \u201cIn our studies, 72 percent of the general population know who Shaq is, which is huge,\u201d said Henry Schafer, the executive VP of the Q Scores company. \u201cThat puts him almost at the same level as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. His likability is good; there\u2019s no sign of polarization. He\u2019s not afraid to make fun of himself which is a good redeeming quality. He\u2019s a good and safe spokesperson to use because when someone sees him in a commercial or ad, they recognize him right away and engagement is going to happen because of his likability. And he has 81 percent recognition to sports fans which is pretty close to being universally known.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always such a welcoming industry to athletes. Even the icons rarely if ever moved product. Joe DiMaggio was restricted to coffee makers , Joe Namath to panty hose , Muhammad Ali to roach hotels . Then OJ Simpson broke ground in the \u201870s and Jordan took it to another level the next decade, with Woods then taking the baton. NBA players currently enjoy a healthy relationship with products although most are tied to athletic apparel and entertainment gadgets. But none, not even LeBron, can approach Shaq for sheer vast. And so \u2026 how did this happen? How did Shaq\u2019s brand portfolio get this swole? He says this was all \u201cShaq-cidental.\u201d At LSU, he bought a Bronco II for $1,500, only to be told he needed car insurance, which was foreign to him (\u201cwhat\u2019s insurance?\u201d he asked) and beyond his budget back then. He eventually bought coverage from the General Insurance Company at $19 a month and many years later endorsed it. With the Lakers, he developed muscle pain typical for athletes. Former trainer Gary Vitti applied ointment that inflamed Shaq\u2019s leg \u2026 and quickly soothed it. So Shaq began hawking Icy Hot which, to this day, is his longest-running endorsement. He got in early on Google, now a mainstay in our viral lives. On the flip side, he pitched for Toys R Us and Radio Shack , both now out of business. He went with Buick instead of the pricier European luxury cars because, sticking to his pledge, he wants products most people can afford. He got lucky recently with Carnival Cruise Lines. The chairman, Micky Arison, also runs the Miami Heat , where Shaq won a championship . Arison asked him to pitch product and initially, Shaq was wary. \u201cTen years ago I probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at it,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cI always thought those ships were for old people. But I got on one and I was wrong. I told Micky that a lot of people don\u2019t know how cool this Carnival is. I told him people thought like I did, so let\u2019s do something (commercially) that\u2019s really fun.\u201d A few years ago he purchased 30 acres in the Atlanta area for a home and wanted security. Some estimates by firms were huge (yes, even Shaq has a budget). He went to a Best Buy store (yes, even Shaq shops by himself) and saw Ring and put 10 cameras inside and out his home for $3,000 and fell in love with the system . \u201cIf a fly flies by, that thing is going off,\u201d Shaq said. During a tech conference in 2016 he met Jamie Siminoff, the inventor and principle owner, and said: \u201cI want in.\u201d Done. Equity and commercials. Two years later Ring was purchased by Amazon for an estimated $1.5 billion. About a decade ago Shaq met with Howard Schultz, the billionaire former executive chairman of Starbucks . Schultz wanted to expand the company\u2019s reach and branch the product into inner cities. He offered stores and stock in exchange for Shaq\u2019s involvement. Shaq was not impressed. \u201cI was like, I\u2019m from the \u2018hood and I ain\u2019t never seen a Starbucks. I told this man to his face: Black people don\u2019t drink coffee. I never saw my folks drink coffee. Then he says \u2018fine\u2019 and goes to Magic Johnson and gives him the offer. Magic gets like 15 or 20 franchises and I felt bad, especially now, when I go and see black people drinking coffee in Starbucks.\u201d Lesson learned. Which recalls Shaq\u2019s most prickly product: Papa John\u2019s Pizza. The former owner and chairman of one of the country\u2019s largest pizza chains, John Schnatter, stepped down in shame in 2018 after making controversial remarks regarding kneeling NFL players in late 2017 and later was overhead making racial comments on a conference call in 2018. It was a PR nightmare and threw the company into chaos. Major changes were swiftly made at the top, consumer confidence dipped, sales were in jeopardy. Joe Smith, the chief financial officer of the company, approached Shaq, who loved the pizza. Shaq had demands, though: Papa John\u2019s had to cut all ties with Schnatter. And, Shaq had to be named to the board, which then lacked African Americans. And Shaq wanted franchises; he now has nine in the Atlanta area . And now, through the shakeup, comes a tasty irony: The face of Papa John\u2019s is a black man. Shaq said he received some backlash for his role in the company when he made an appearance at Morehouse College. Well: He offers no apologies and says needed changes from within Papa John\u2019s only happened because of him. Shaq says he places special emphasis on working with companies that lack exposure to African Americans and other traditionally underserved people of color. \u201cA lot of times companies need to get the word out about something because we have buying power,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cSo when they need to get the word out, I\u2019m the guy they go to. That\u2019s why everything I do has an affordable price to it.\u201d https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v Along with Magic Johnson and Dave Bing, Shaq\u2019s role model in business is Junior Bridgeman, the former Bucks player who created an estimated $600 million fortune through product franchises and other businesses. Shaq says he owes his endorsement empire partly to a pair of forces: His role on the popular \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show, and his own NBA career. He won four championships and is in the Hall of Fame. That counts for credibility. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about image,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning. Would I have all of this without the championships? Never. It\u2019s winning. I\u2019m only Shaq because I\u2019m a winner. Got three in a row, left one team, then got another one. Doing stuff is OK but I had to win. Had to have the validation.\u201d As for the show, Shaq wasn\u2019t sure about his post-career plans once he retired after 19 years, yet chose wisely. \u201cInside the NBA\u201d is arguably the most popular pre- and post-game show in all of sports and the weekly visibility from it has only enhanced Shaq\u2019s presence with the public and in turn fed his commercial work. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have a likable show, then I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is funny, we make people laugh, we fight, we argue.\u201d This might be a strange question, but is it possible that a retired player can suffer from overexposure with so many endorsements? \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can never have too many. And the stuff I give is simple, every day stuff that people use. I don\u2019t do deals just to take people\u2019s money. That\u2019s not good business. There\u2019s not a plan where I sit around and say, \u2018Call Diet Coke.\u2019 It just happens. I\u2019m prepared for anything. What keeps me motivated is I define goals for myself. And it\u2019s not just the art of the deal, it\u2019s the art of the renewal. If you keep getting renewed, everything must be alright.\u201d His dream is to someday star in a string of commercials with his sons. That would allow them to get some shine, perhaps launch opportunities for them, or if nothing else become a unique family bonding experience. Given his rapid and consistent track record in the biz, making that happen wouldn\u2019t be beyond his reach. Perhaps a certain pizza chain would cooperate and allow itself to be temporarily renamed \u2026 Papa Shaq\u2019s? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

A copy of the proposal was obtained by The Associated Press on Friday. The plan laid out for teams calls for a play-in tournament to decide the seventh and eighth seeds in both conferences \u2013 the top 10 finishers in both the East and West would therefore have a chance at the playoffs \u2013 as well as a $1 million per player prize for the in-season tournament. The league would make the changes for the 2021-22 season on a trial basis, with an option to continue the next season. The league\u2019s board of governors is expected to discuss and likely decide whether to go forward or not with the plan in April. The notion of adding a in-season tournament has been something Commissioner Adam Silver has talked about since at least 2016, drawing the parallel to how such events are customary in European soccer. \u201cIt would need to be negotiated with the Players Association,\u201d Silver said earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019ve had very general discussions with (union executive director) Michele Roberts about the notion that these are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking at. I think she, of course, is supportive of looking at any ideas we have to build the business over time.\u201d ESPN and The Athletic first reported on the contents of the proposal. The NBA told teams that a study it commissioned through a third-party company earlier this year showed that 60% of NBA fans want a shorter regular season, that 68% of fans said they are interested in an in-season tournament and 75% were interested in a play-in tournament to decide the playoff field. The same study, the NBA said, found fans liked the idea of reseeding the final four playoff teams \u2013 even though that would open the door to the potential of the NBA Finals going on between two teams from the same conference. The NBA told teams that \u201cfans feel it would make the final two rounds more desirable to watch.\u201d A breakdown of the changes: IN-SEASON TOURNAMENT The proposal calls for teams to play eight divisional games in the group stage of the event, which would begin Nov. 24, 2021 and continue through Dec. 11. (The NBA said the dates are tentative.) The group stage games \u2013 four home, four away \u2013 would count toward a team\u2019s regular-season total. The six division winners and two wild cards would qualify for the quarterfinals on Dec. 13 and 14, 2021. Semifinals would be played as a doubleheader on Dec. 16 and the title game would be played two days later \u2013 with the semis and finals at a neutral site like Las Vegas. Players on the winning team would split $15 million; the winning coaching staff would split $1.5 million. The NBA said that there is the potential for \u201cadditional prizing for players on the remaining final four teams\u201d and that other incentives for teams and fans were \u201cto be determined.\u201d PLAY-IN TOURNAMENT The regular season would end on a Saturday, one week before the start of the playoffs \u2013 as opposed to ending on Wednesday, as has been the case for years. The top six teams in each conference would be in the playoffs. The teams in seventh through 10th place in the regular-season standings would play off as follows: The seventh- and eighth-place teams would play with the winner clinching the No. 7 playoff seed. The teams holding the ninth- and 10th-place regular season spots would also play, and the winner of that game would play the loser of the 7-8 game to determine the No. 8 playoff seed. From there, the first two rounds would be played as usual. Once the playoff field is down to four teams, those clubs would be reseeded based on regular-season record."},{"id":29885,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spencer-dinwiddie-g-league-potential-all-star-0","date":"2019-12-21","title":"Spencer Dinwiddie's rise from G League player to potential All-Star","content":" SAN ANTONIO \u2013 Fifty-eight seconds of footage tweeted by NBA TV on Dec. 16 flashed across smartphones. Uncontested layup, then a one-handed poster jam over Tobias Harris. Spencer Dinwiddie next uses the crossover to set up a Eurostep into a reverse layup, before finally draining a 3 to stamp the exclamation point on a night in which he led the Brooklyn Nets with 24 points and six assists in a 109-89 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. Brief, yes. But those highlights in some ways encapsulate the grind toiled by Dinwiddie to get here \u2014 from G League up-and-comer to potential All-Star in the NBA \u2014 traversing a road littered by a catastrophic college knee injury and a pair of teams giving up on him, not to mention those trying times working to convince decision-makers he belongs in the league, while simultaneously pondering whether to chase a hoops career overseas. \u201cI just think in this life, you\u2019re always gonna have people telling you what you can\u2019t do,\u201d Dinwiddie told NBA.com. \u201cThis is not an easy business at all. Obviously, the perks are on the world\u2019s stage, and everybody knows the money and all these other things, which are great and all. But all of your failures are also on the world\u2019s stage; everybody constantly telling you you\u2019re not good enough. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to Walmart and tell you you\u2019re the worst cashier in the world. You might have to deal with a couple of disgruntled people. But it\u2019s not like millions of people are telling you that you suck. You have to be just a little crazy, too. So, if you don\u2019t have that certain mentality or mental toughness, this league, this entertainment industry as a whole can break you. You see it happen all the time. I\u2019ve just been fortunate to have a great foundation and for it not to happen to me.\u201d That dogged approach helped Dinwiddie rise from playing in the G League to earning a three-year extension in Brooklyn worth $34 million. * * * Down the hall inside the home locker room at the AT&T Center \u2014 where Dinwiddie lit up San Antonio for a career-high 41 points in a 118-105 loss on Thursday \u2014 is Spurs guard Bryn Forbes. The 26-year-old played for San Antonio\u2019s G League affiliate, the Austin Spurs, and can relate to the grind, including the hectic traveling and back-and-forth routine. \u201cOne time, I flew and met [the Austin Spurs] in OKC,\u201d Forbes says. \u201cBefore the game that same day, they said they needed me in Mexico [City, Mexico]. This is when we played Phoenix in Mexico. After that, I flew back and played in Austin like the very next day. It was crazy.\u201d That\u2019s not even taking into account all the driving involved on the come-up from the G League to the NBA.  \u201cIf there was traffic, it was over man,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI could listen to three albums on my way there. That wasn\u2019t enjoyable. I\u2019d go [to Austin], and before the game, [the San Antonio Spurs] would call me right back. So, I would drive to Austin for nothing. Then, somebody like Manu [Ginobili] wouldn\u2019t be playing or something or someone else went down. And they\u2019d be like, \u2018We\u2019re just going to need you to come right back.\u2019 So, I\u2019d drive all the way back after getting there to try to make it back here.\u201d Lakers guard Troy Daniels, who spent time with Houston\u2019s G League affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, stressed that flexing an optimistic viewpoint is the way to succeed on the climb towards the NBA. \u201cJust know that [there\u2019s] a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to set yourself goals and try to obtain the goals that you set. Roll with the punches.  My first 10 games it was hard for me. Just to adapt to flying commercial [with] red eyes, sitting in the middle seat. \u201cEverybody was trying to get the exit row. Even the hotels, Holiday Inns and stuff like that. But I think as I started playing more, I started having love for the game again, started playing really well, and started having fun. Obviously, it\u2019s a grind, but when you realize it\u2019s still basketball [and] you\u2019re still having fun, it\u2019s easier to put everything else to the side. \u201d That\u2019s how Dinwiddie successfully navigated his own winding journey. * * * After suffering a career-threatening ACL injury as a junior at Colorado in 2014, Dinwiddie declared for the NBA Draft, where Detroit selected him 38th overall. He made his NBA debut on Oct. 29, 2014 before earning the starting nod Feb. 20 against the Chicago Bulls in a game he finished with 12 points and nine assists. In the midst of all that, Detroit sent Dinwiddie to Grand Rapid for G League assignment on several occasions over his first two seasons as a professional. But on June 17, 2016, the Pistons traded Dinwiddie to the Bulls, which would waive him twice; the last time following the 2016 preseason. His shot came with the G League\u2019s Windy City Bulls nine days after Chicago waived him.  \u201cI experienced the G League in two forms: one as an assignment player, and then one of actually being in the G League after I got cut by the Bulls,\u201d Dinwiddie said. \u201cObviously, both situations are different. You actually sort of still get treated like an NBA player when you\u2019re on assignment. When you\u2019re in G League on contract, you\u2019re down there for real. So, it\u2019s tough.\u201d Initially, Dinwiddie didn\u2019t want to be a part of the Bulls organization anymore after being waived, but he\u2019d go on to average 19.4 points, 8.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds in nine games with their G League team. \u201cSpencer just felt like he had his opportunity with the Bulls, and that didn\u2019t work, so why go and be with the G League affiliate?\u201d said Chicago Bulls assistant coach Nate Loenser, who served as head coach of the Windy City Bulls from their inaugural season in 2016 to 2018. \u201cI told him that in my mind, he was an NBA player, and just for whatever reason, this was going to be a path that he had to take. \u201cI told him, \u2018This is your opportunity to really lead a team. I know that you can come in and score 30 points a game and do all that. But my biggest thing is: can you run a team? Can you really take the keys to this thing and really strive on all the things you need to stick in the NBA?\u2019\u201d Dinwiddie took the keys, and in December of 2016, drove out of the G League for good when Brooklyn signed him to a three-year veteran minimum deal. Years later, he\u2019s fired up the ignition to keep Brooklyn humming along in the wake of Kyrie Irving\u2019s injury. The six-time All-Star has been out of the lineup for 16 games with a right shoulder impingement. Now, Dinwiddie may be forging his own All-Star path. He heads into Saturday\u2019s game against the Atlanta Hawks averaging career highs in points (22.1) and usage rate (29.9) over his first 16 starts of the season. Since becoming the starting point guard, Dinwiddie leads Brooklyn in points (25.3), assists (7.2), free throws made (6.1) and free throws attempted (7.2). He earned Player of the Week honors a few weeks back and has scored 20 or more in 15 of his last 17 games. \u201cYou have to focus on your craft,\u201d Dinwiddie said. \u201cA lot of times in this game, at this level, there are a lot of people that can play. The top 100 guys overseas could play in the NBA, right? But a lot of times, it\u2019s about that opportunity, about that fit.\u201d \u201cIf I don\u2019t get that opportunity here, none of this stuff happens. So, everything has to intersect and collide together, but you also have to keep the work ethic, keep the focus, keep the faith, keep your confidence, all those things. But then that opportunity has to present itself as well.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

We are 34% through the 2019-20 NBA season. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 9 weekend and look forward to five games on Christmas.  The Bucks and Lakers didn\u2019t just enter their matchup on Thursday with the best records in the league. They also ranked first and second in points in the paint differential, with Milwaukee having outscored its opponents by 14.4 points in the paint per game over its first 28 games. L.A. was a plus-10.1 in the paint through its first 28. For context, entering Thursday\u2019s action, the Memphis Grizzlies ranked third in points in the paint differential (plus-6.6). The Lakers actually outscored the Bucks, 42-34 , in the paint on Thursday. The difference in Milwaukee\u2019s 111-104 win was points from 3-point range (48-36 in favor of Milwaukee) and from the free-throw line (23-18). But the Lakers\u2019 42 points in the paint were well below their average of 53.4 (prior to Thursday). Only 33% (26) of their 80 shots came in the restricted area, down from 37% over their first 28 games. The Bucks\u2019 win was just the second time in the last 18 games that LeBron James was held to fewer than 12 points in the paint . The biggest reason the Bucks have the league\u2019s No. 1 defense (102.1 points allowed per 100 possessions) is that they protect the basket much better than any other team. Though the league takes more 3-pointers every season, shots in the restricted area remain the most valuable, worth 1.25 points per attempt. The Bucks are No. 1, by healthy margins , in both opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (54.9%) and the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came from the restricted area (25.5%) The 26.0 ppg they\u2019ve allowed in the restricted area would be the fewest in the last five seasons. It helps to have great rim protectors. Among players who have defended at least five shots at the rim per game, Brook Lopez ranks as the league\u2019s second-best rim protector , with opponents having shot just 46.5% at the rim when he\u2019s been there. They\u2019ve shot even worse with Giannis Antetokounmpo (45.1%) or Robin Lopez (45.1%) at the rim. But the Bucks\u2019 rim protection goes beyond their personnel. It\u2019s about their scheme, which prioritizes rim protection over everything else. Two possessions midway through the first quarter Thursday illustrated that \u2014 and what the Bucks are willing to sacrifice to prevent the most efficient shots on the floor. The play was for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to come out of the left corner off screens from James and Anthony Davis, then take a dribble handoff from JaVale McGee at the right elbow, and attack the basket. After the screens, James and Davis popped out to the perimeter, while McGee rolled to the rim. The first time the Lakers ran it, Caldwell-Pope drew a commitment from Brook Lopez and tossed up a lob for McGee. But Antetokounmpo sunk off his man (Davis) and deflected the lob. The Lakers saw what was open, so they ran the same play two possessions later, with Caldwell-Pope kicking out to Davis, who missed a 3-pointer from the top of the arc. McGee has shot 70% on shots in the restricted area, while Davis has shot 27% on above-the-break 3-pointers. Even with the added value of a 3-pointer, the math works out for the Bucks in giving up the latter to prevent the former. The Bucks will give up some 3-pointers. Last season, they set an NBA record by allowing their opponents to make 1,073 of them . This season, they\u2019re on pace to allow 1,162. Because the Bucks\u2019 weak-side defenders pinch in to help protect the paint, open 3-pointers can be had on the opposite side of the floor. The Lakers\u2019 first possession of the game was a \u201cHammer\u201d play to get Danny Green a weak-side corner 3-pointer . And during TNT\u2019s \u201cInside Trax\u201d segment on Thursday, Lakers coach Frank Vogel was heard telling his team to look for \u201csecond-side 3s.\u201d The Bucks, though, will take the math that comes with protecting the rim much better than any other team in the league. (Milwaukee also ranks in the top five in opponent free throw rate and defensive rebounding percentage .) To get those open 3-pointers, you will need to make tough passes across the floor and shoot before the Bucks\u2019 close out. James can make those passes and Danny Green was 7-for-12 from beyond the arc on Thursday (it\u2019s not a coincidence that his season high for attempts came against the Bucks), but Lakers not named Green were 5-for-23. Davis still scored 18 points in the paint on Thursday. He\u2019s too big and too skilled to keep him from scoring inside. But his points at the rim were more about his talent than the actions the Lakers ran to get him there. Midway through the second quarter, the Lakers ran a \u201cSpain\u201d pick-and-roll, with Rajon Rondo and Davis running pick-and-roll from the top, and Green setting a back-screen on Ersan Ilyasova (guarding Davis). Antetokounmpo (guarding Green) had to help on Rondo\u2019s drive, giving Davis a clean roll to the basket. But Donte DiVincenzo left Caldwell-Pope in the weak-side corner, sold out, and deflected Rondo\u2019s lob pass. It\u2019s the personnel. It\u2019s the scheme. And it\u2019s the adherence to the scheme that makes the Bucks the best defensive team in the league. They\u2019ll take the No. 1 defense to Madison Square Garden on Saturday ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). They\u2019ll then host the Pacers on Sunday (7 ET, League Pass) before visiting Philadelphia on Christmas Day (2:30 ET, ABC). > Can you name the 3 teams who haven\u2019t played any rookies this season? ( The answer is item No. 4 this week. )  The Timberwolves lost (or won?) a battle of losing streaks on Wednesday, dropping a rest-advantage game at home to the Pelicans , who had the longest losing streak of the season (13 games). The Wolves have now lost eight straight ; They entered December in seventh place in the West with a 10-8 record, and they\u2019ve fallen to 12th at 10-16. The Wolves\u2019 offense has actually been better in December (111.5 points scored per 100 possessions) than it was prior (106.5). But the Wolves rank last defensively this month, having allowed 121.2 points per 100 possessions. They\u2019ve been relatively healthy. Seven of the top eight Timberwolves in regard to minutes per night have played at least 22 of their 26 games. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve had lineup continuity. The Wolves\u2019 most-used lineup \u2014 Jarrett Culver, Treveon Graham, Andrew Wiggins, Robert Covington and Karl-Anthony Towns \u2014 has played just 75 minutes together . That\u2019s the fewest minutes played for any team\u2019s most-used lineup, 369 fewer minutes than the Nuggets\u2019 starters have played together. Minnesota has had the same starting lineup \u2014 Josh Okogie on the wing instead of Graham \u2014 in five of their eight December games. But that lineup has averaged just 9.1 minutes on the floor together in those five starts, and it\u2019s been outscored by 33 points in its 46 total minutes this month. As the Wolves head out on a four-game trip that begins in Denver on Friday ( 9 ET, League Pass ), coach Ryan Saunders is still looking for answers in regard to who he should be putting out on the floor. The Warriors and Blazers ranked first and third in offensive efficiency last season , scoring 115.0 and 113.7 points per 100 possessions, respectively. But as they both lost on Christmas night in 2018 , they combined to score just 197 points on 206 possessions. For the Warriors, their loss to the Lakers \u2014 in which Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant combined to shoot 12-for-37 \u2014 was their sixth-least efficient offensive game of last season . For the Blazers, their loss in Utah \u2014 in which Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic combined to shoot 16-for-45 \u2014 was their fifth-least efficient game of last season . The Christmas schedule always features marquee matchups. But sometimes, games on Christmas aren\u2019t so pretty. Last season, ten teams combined to score 104.6 points per 100 possessions on Christmas. That was much lower than the 109.4 per 100 the league scored over the five days of games prior (Dec. 19-23) and the 109.2 it scored over the five days of games after (Dec. 26-30). The ugliest Christmas in recent memory was 2015 , when only one of the 10 teams playing scored a point per possession. That year, five of the 10 teams scored fewer than 90 per 100 and the average score that day was 94-87. So are all Christmas slates less efficient than usual? Actually, no. In five of the last 10 years (skipping over 2011-12, when Christmas was the first day of the season), Christmas games have been, on average, more efficient than the games played in the 10 days around Christmas. Offenses were particularly sharp on Christmas of 2016, which featured a fantastic Finals rematch in Cleveland . We\u2019ll see how things go on Wednesday, when the Christmas slate features two matchups between four of the five best teams in the Eastern Conference, along with Clippers-Lakers. Five of the 10 teams playing on Christmas rank in the top 10 offensively , while seven of the 10 rank in the top 10 defensively .  The three teams that haven\u2019t played any rookies this season are the Mavs, Bucks and Magic. Two other teams \u2014 the Raptors and Jazz \u2014 haven\u2019t played any second-year players. The Lakers have played three first-or second-year players, but those three \u2014 Kostas Antetokounmpo, Talen Horton-Tucker and Zach Norvell Jr. \u2014 have played just 10 total minutes. That\u2019s 0.1% of the total minutes logged by Lakers players. That\u2019s the league\u2019s lowest ratio, and the Lakers are followed by the Jazz, Nuggets and Spurs as teams that are all-in on vets. The Sacramento Kings are also in the bottom five, though they\u2019ll probably drop now that Marvin Bagley is back. On the other end of the list are four teams from the Southeast Division and the Memphis Grizzlies \u2026 The Heat are 20-8, while the other four teams above are no fewer than five games under .500. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

A test for Toronto Injuries to Marc Gasol, Norman Powell and, most notably, Pascal Siakam have the Raptors in a rough spot. All three are out indefinitely , which leaves Toronto missing a combined 46.1 ppg from the trio not to mention the defensive acumen all three bring. A home date with the Wizards ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) will surely challenge the Raptors\u2019 defense as Washington is in the top 5 in Offensive Rating and has seen Davis Bertans (21.8 ppg over his last five games) hit a hot streak. 2. Embiid looking mighty motivated The Mavericks are looking solid on the road, going 10-2 so far. However, a date tonight in Philadelphia ( 8 ET, ESPN ) means Dallas will have to find a way to slow down Joel Embiid. He\u2019s been on a tear since Charles Barkley and Shaquille O\u2019Neal called him out on Dec. 10, averaging 28 points, 14.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in the three games since. A matchup with Kristaps Porzingis and the Mavs\u2019 other assortment of bigs should make this an interesting watch. 3. Pacers trying to build on success Logging a win against one of the NBA\u2019s hottest teams \u2014 as Indiana did Tuesday vs. the Lakers \u2014 can spark a surge of wins. The Pacers are just getting started in that department as they aim for a fifth straight win in hosting Sacramento ( 7 ET, League Pass ). Since Thanksgiving (which, yes, is a small sample size), Indiana has the NBA\u2019s second-best record (8-3) and has wins against the Jazz, Lakers and Celtics during that span. 4. Another (comeback) win for OKC? Two wins, two rallies from 24-point (or larger) deficits for the Thunder. That\u2019s what OKC is working with lately as it has climbed back into the Western Conference playoff mix and seeks its sixth win in eight games. The Suns are paying a visit ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and are going the opposite way (four straight losses) despite the recent return of Deandre Ayton. Should be interesting to see if the Thunder play with fire again. 5. Scoring 62 \u2026 in just 3 quarters Kobe Bryant will be remembered for a lot of different on-court exploits, with his 81-point game vs. Toronto being perhaps his greatest regular-season feat. But not to be outdone was the game he delivered on Dec. 20, 2005 vs. the Dallas Mavericks. He needed just three quarters to score 62 points, becoming the 19th player at the time to surpass 60 points. Additionally, his 62-point game was the most by any player since David Robinson\u2019s 71 vs. the Clippers in 1994.

And he\u2019s not yearning for any validation of his decision to join the Miami Heat last summer . He\u2019ll let the results do the talking instead of focusing on whatever labels others try to come up with to define the surprising Heat. \u201cThis is a team of one star?\u201d Butler asked reporters after the Heat ended Philadelphia\u2019s perfect home record Wednesday. \u201cWho\u2019s our star, Bam [Adebayo]? I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll take Bam as our star any day. I ain\u2019t worried about what anybody says. We\u2019re content with who we are.\u201d This Heat team is establishing an identity as a rugged bunch capable of competing against the NBA\u2019s best this season with Butler (and not the vastly improved Adebayo or anyone else) as their biggest star. Butler can brush aside the praise all he wants. But there is no mistaking he\u2019s the main ingredient in the Heat\u2019s rise in 2019-20 . Miami has the Eastern Conference\u2019s third-best record \u2014 trailing only Milwaukee and Boston \u2014 as a home date with New York on Friday looms ( 8 ET, League Pass ). It only makes sense, then, that Butler rises the ranks on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Butler\u2019s laser-like focus on leading this young Heat team is obviously his priority. He\u2019s been off the charts in that and overall for the Heat , leading them in points (20.9), assists (6.8) and steals (2.1). \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve coached a lot of guys like Jimmy that are adults, that are very serious about winning, about the process of winning,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cUltra competitive. He\u2019s a max player. We wanted a max player, someone that would fit our culture and our system.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 31.8 points, 12.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.2 blocks Antetokounmpo made it clear who sits atop the NBA\u2019s player pecking order with a sterling effort in Thursday night\u2019s showdown with LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers. He was the best player on the floor in the battle between the league\u2019s two best teams, finishing with 34 points on 11-for-19 shooting (including 5-for-8 on 3-pointers), 11 rebounds and seven assists. In a statement game for both teams, Giannis left the biggest mark. Last week: No. 3 Season stats: 25.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, 10.6 assists, 1.3 steals J ust another game, huh? LeBron certainly didn\u2019t treat it like that. He did his part in Milwaukee Thursday night with yet another triple-double (21 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists), but it wasn\u2019t enough to lift the Lakers past Antetokounmpo and the Bucks. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 29.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.2 steals The good news is the ankle injury Doncic suffered two minutes into Saturday\u2019s loss to the Miami Heat isn\u2019t nearly as severe as it appeared originally. The bad news is the Mavericks will have to work without him for at least a few more games. Injury was the only thing that could slow down Doncic\u2019s season-long roll. Last week: No. 4 Season stats: 38.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 7.5 assists, 1.9 steals Harden deferred to Russell Westbrook Thursday night as the Rockets knocked off the LA Clippers at Staples Center. Harden played well (28 points and 10 assists) but Westbrook (the Rockets\u2019 \u201cother MVP,\u201d as Clippers coach Doc Rivers put it), went off for 40 points, 10 rebounds and five assists as the Clippers keyed in on slowing down Harden. Last week: No. 5 Season stats: 27.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.4 steals, 2.6 blocks Davis played through whatever ankle discomfort he was dealing with and led the Lakers with 36 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three blocks in their loss to the Bucks. He had a peculiar shooting night (0-for-6 on 3-pointers; 14-for-17 on free throws) and didn\u2019t look nearly as comfortable as he has been recently. It\u2019s clear the Lakers need him at his healthy best to be their best. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase? Hit me up via e-mail or send me a tweet and I\u2019ll get back to you! * * * 6.

Centered at the intersection of art and activism, Imagine Justice is dedicated to leveraging the power of art to advocate for communities around the country, to fight for justice and equality and to stand united against injustice wherever it appears.

Two days before an anticipated showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night, the team was scheduled for a \u201cplayer individual day\u201d on Tuesday \u2014 usually used for individuals to get extra training or medical treatment. Instead, the players opted to hear stories from inmates at the Racine Correctional Institution. \u201cI wasn\u2019t seeing guys that made mistakes,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI was just seeing humans, humans that were laughing, that were trying hard, humans that shared their stories. That really touched me and I realized sometimes we take things for granted. That\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201d Antetokounmpo, his older brother, Thanasis, and other Milwaukee teammates Sterling Brown, Kyle Korver, George Hill, Pat Connaughton and D.J. Wilson traveled about 30 miles south of Milwaukee to the prison to take part in the \u201cPlay for Justice\u201d initiative, which brings together NBA teams and inmates at correctional facilities across the country. The event, organized by Represent Justice, One Community and the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, sets out to break down stigmas associated with individuals \u2014 disproportionately people of color and the poor \u2014 who are impacted by the criminal justice system. The event was launched alongside the upcoming film, \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d about a wrongfully convicted black man on death row in Alabama. The Sacramento Kings held the first \u201cPlay for Justice\u201d event last week at Folsom State Prison in California. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer, some of his assistants and former NBA player Caron Butler \u2014 born in Racine \u2014 also attended as some of the more than 1,600 incarcerated men shared stories of crimes and mistakes that changed their lives. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re around anything that\u2019s powerful, that\u2019s bigger than you, that makes you think about how do we make a difference in life and other people\u2019s lives, and makes you think about other people, I think it makes our team think about their teammates or how they could be doing something maybe better for each other and be more empathetic toward each other,\u201d Budenholzer said. Each player also shared stories of their respective journeys, recalling childhoods in broken homes or impoverished environments. Brown has a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Milwaukee Police Department and the city that stems from a January 2018 incident where a group of officers took him to the ground, tasered and arrested him after a parking violation at a Walgreens. The incident prompted an internal investigation that ended with several officers suspended and others retrained. Brown, who was not charged in the incident, opened up about that night and his mission going forward. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m being that voice for those that don\u2019t have a platform.\u201d The 25-year-old Antetokounmpo said he didn\u2019t always make the best decisions while growing up in Greece. He said his family, specifically his father Charles, helped him straighten out his life. Charles died of a heart attack at 54 in 2017. Antetokounmpo said he spoke with his family after the visit and told them it was an eye-opening experience. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how many things you take for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, they made mistakes. But at the end of the day, you have to realize they\u2019re human.\u201d Budenholzer, Bucks front office personnel, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes played a game of basketball alongside some of the inmates. Antetokounmpo and his teammates served as honorary coaches. The Milwaukee players laughed and cheered with each possession. Antetokounmpo even took jabs at Budenholzer for his lack of effort on defense. \u201cHe made a big 3 and gave us a lot of momentum,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cSo I was happy with him and kept him in the game for like 25 more seconds because I realized defensively he wasn\u2019t that good.\u201d The Bucks return to the court Thursday against the Lakers in a contest between teams tied for the NBA\u2019s best record. It will be Antetokounmpo against LeBron James \u2014 and possibly a preview of the NBA Finals. With all of that looming, the Bucks thought getting out of the training facility would be the best way to prepare. \u201cIt\u2019s means a lot,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cJust seeing one another off the court, especially when you go and do something for a good purpose and try to change people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s always good. That definitely brings the team together. And when you have each other\u2019s backs off the court, you have each other\u2019s backs on the court.

(AP) \u2014 James Wiseman\u2019s college career has come to an end after just three games with the Memphis center and likely NBA lottery pick saying on social media he has withdrawn from school to begin focusing on his pro career rather than sitting out the rest of a 12-game NCAA suspension. The 7-foot-1 freshman announced his decision Thursday in an Instagram post , saying he was leaving school to start \u201cpreparing for the next chapter of my life.\u201d https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B6RB_3DgtS1\/ \u201cEver since I was a little kid, it\u2019s been a dream of mine to play in the NBA,\u201d Wiseman wrote. Wiseman was the top 2019 high school prospect and is considered the potential No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. This decision ends Wiseman\u2019s tumultuous college career and his battles with the NCAA. Wiseman was the biggest prize in a Memphis recruiting class that was ranked as the nation\u2019s best, but he had been serving an NCAA suspension for most of the season. \u201cWe wish nothing but the best for James in his future endeavors as he follows his dreams,\u201d Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said. \u201cHe will truly be missed.\u201d University of Memphis officials said in a statement that Wiseman\u2019s announcement was disappointing. \u201cThe UofM supports James and his family in his decision to leave to prepare for the 2020 NBA draft and will continue to follow James in what will certainly prove to be a successful career,\u201d official said in the statement. The NCAA suspended Wiseman 12 games because his family received $11,500 to assist in a move from Nashville to Memphis in the summer of 2017. Although Hardaway wasn\u2019t Memphis\u2019 coach at the time, the NCAA ruled the payment wasn\u2019t allowed counting him as a booster for giving $1 million in 2008 to his alma mater for the university\u2019s sports hall of fame. The NCAA had ruled Wiseman needed to donate $11,500 to a charity of his choice to regain his eligibility \u2014 though that now seems like a moot point. After the NCAA notified Memphis that Wiseman was \u201clikely ineligible\u201d just before the start of the season, Wiseman went to court and sued the NCAA and the University of Memphis. He played two games under a temporary restraining order obtained Nov. 8 in dramatic fashion less than an hour before tipoff of the Tigers\u2019 second game of the season. But in another turn of events, Wiseman ordered his attorneys to drop the lawsuit Nov. 14, which led to Memphis ruling him ineligible immediately. The NCAA announced the suspension Nov. 20 and denied Memphis\u2019 appeal on Nov. 27. Wiseman averaged 19.7 points and 10.7 rebounds in Memphis\u2019 first three games. Wiseman had been due to sit out five more games before being able to return to the Tigers\u2019 lineup Jan. 12 at USF. He thanked Memphis\u2019 coaches, staff and his teammates for pushing him in practice. \u201cThis was not how I expected my freshman season to be, but I\u2019m thankful for everyone who has supported my family and me throughout this process ..,\u201d Wiseman wrote. \u201cI feel blessed for the opportunity to be a Tiger and for having the honor to play with these special group of guys. I can\u2019t wait to see what all they accomplish this season. The friends and fans of Tiger Nation will always hold a place in my heart.\u201d Without Wiseman, Memphis (9-1) currently is ranked No. 11 in the country and has won seven straight, including a 51-47 win over then-No. 19 Tennessee last week."},{"id":29905,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/basketball-hall-fame-2020-eligible-candidates-2020","date":"2019-12-19","title":"Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett among eligible candidates for Class of 2020","content":" SPRINGFIELD, MA \u2013 The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame today announced the highly anticipated list of eligible candidates for the Class of 2020, including several high-profile first-time nominees including Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Chris Bosh, Shawn Marion, Michael Finley, Tamika Catchings and Swin Cash.

The 17-year veteran has been a fixture on the roster of his hometown team for so long that it\u2019s hard to remember a time when he wasn\u2019t there. From his days leading Miami Senior High to back-to-back championships to his All-American career at the University of Florida and then back to help the Miami Heat win three titles ( 2006, \u201912, \u201913 ), Haslem\u2019s basketball life has always been centered on the Sunshine State. He\u2019s been the behind-the-scenes backbone in Miami\u2019s locker room through the good times and the bad since the 2003-04 season (when he was an All-Rookie second teamer ). The undrafted Haslem is the Heat\u2019s all-time rebounding leader, the first player in NBA history with that specific distinction. Haslem\u2019s underdog grind always resonates with Heat fans. His fearlessness on the court has endeared him to generations of teammates and earned him respect from his NBA peers, too. For visiting players, Haslem is the best resource on how to move in Miami off the court. If it\u2019s not \u201cUD Certified\u201d \u2014 as one player on an opposing team coined it \u2014 then it\u2019s best to go elsewhere. Haslem is the elder statesman for a Heat team that has been a surprise in 2019-20 and if anyone can navigate from humble beginnings, it\u2019s him. Haslem recently talked with NBA.com about all that and more. (Editor\u2019s Note: Portions of this conversation have been condensed and edited). * * * NBA.com  :  You\u2019ve been in this league a long time and to be associated with one team and one city like that, I can\u2019t think of another player who is associated with his hometown like that. Udonis Haslem: It\u2019s definitely a blessing. It\u2019s gift and it\u2019s a curse, man. I mean being at home every day, every single day. I\u2019ve lost friends I never thought I\u2019d lose and I\u2019ve made friends I never thought I\u2019d make, been in situations and places I never thought I\u2019d be in. It\u2019s all a part of my growth and maturation, on and off the basketball court. But make no mistake about it, I\u2019m still 10 toes down and affiliated with the other side, you know what I mean? And I keep my respect on that level. And I move in a way that I don\u2019t separate myself from anybody. I mean, I\u2019m always there. I\u2019m always in the middle of the action, the good and the bad. And that\u2019s not a bad thing, that\u2019s just to say that I still engage with my people, man. I still engage with my people on every level. This community has seen winning in your time here. What\u2019s that like to see that, to be out in this community after you win championships and do that kind of stuff? One thing I know about Miami is we got a lot of pride. We love to tell people we\u2019re from Miami. We love to talk about what\u2019s going on in this amazing, beautiful city. And that just adds to it, to be able to say we\u2019re the best at something. Not too many people can say that they are the best at something. They can say we play this or we got here. But to say that you are the best in the entire world at one thing, not too many people can say that. So it gives the city a chance to say we have the best basketball team in the world right now. It\u2019s an amazing accomplishment for us, [one] for the organization and [two] for the city as well, to add to the Miami bravado and the Miami swag and everything that comes with being in Miami. To be in this league for this long, you\u2019ve seen various guys come and go. What\u2019s been the key to your longevity? Evolution, man. Evolution. You\u2019ve got to evolve or you won\u2019t be around. Evolve or die is a quote that Coach Spo [Erik Spoelstra] gave me a long time ago. And at that time I wasn\u2019t trying to hear it. But evolution doesn\u2019t always mean on the basketball court. Sometimes it means off the court, as a leader, as a professional, as a father, as a parent and all those different things. I had to evolve. And for me, I always carried that chip on my shoulder. I was always looking for the next challenge, the next underdog opportunity to overcome and things like that, to continue to push myself. Over the years we accomplished so much, that now I have to turn the focus from myself to pushing other people, pushing the program, this organization, this culture. And that\u2019s what I had to focus on. In the last decade plus, you\u2019ve been able to see the Heat go from down to back up again. This current team, you\u2019re building it back up again with the same infrastructure \u2026 is there something about the consistency of the culture around here that facilitates all of that? We believe in it. And we believe in it wholeheartedly. It might not be the only way to get it done, but it\u2019s our way to get it done. It means having everyone on the same accord. Having foundation. Having rules and guidelines. Having guys like myself to implement those rules and guidelines. It\u2019s one thing to have a coach give the message and do the things that coaches do. But it\u2019s different to have someone in the locker room that\u2019s a living, breathing example of the culture that you want to transfer to those guys, that you want to impart upon them. I\u2019m that living, breathing example. I\u2019m living it every day. I\u2019m putting in the work, whether I\u2019m playing or not. And I\u2019m showing you the results of what that culture can bring to you, that sacrifice and what it can bring to you if you do it the right way. The thing is, everybody wants to talk about sacrifice until it\u2019s time for them to sacrifice. Then it\u2019s like, \u2018who me, what? Naw, let them do it.\u2019 But everybody has to do it. Even Bron [LeBron James] had to do it a certain extent. D-Wade [Dwyane Wade] had to do it. And CB [Chris Bosh] had to do it. We all had to sacrifice to be champions. So it\u2019s one thing to preach that and another thing to be somebody that\u2019s about that life. What are you preaching to these young guys that is consistent? You are the last person to speak in the pregame circle before the starters hit the floor. What\u2019s your message? We all we got, we all we need and nobody better than us. It\u2019s always the last thing I say. Before that it\u2019s a lot of other stuff. But I always end it with that. We all we got, we all we need and nobody better than us. And I truly believe that. The only thing that matters is the people in this organization overall, and, more importantly, the people in this locker room who put the hard hat on every day. You talk about the sacrifice you, LeBron, Wade and Bosh had to make. What was it like picking up the pieces after that era? Man, it was tough. It was humbling. But for me, I\u2019ve been the bottom before. So my survival instincts kicked in, that\u2019s who I am and what I am. So when I\u2019m challenged and at the bottom, the last thing you\u2019re going to hear me say is this is too hard. I\u2019m never going to say it\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m never going to complain. I\u2019m always going to find a way to overcome the odds. So going into those seasons when we had lost all of those guys and things weren\u2019t looking well, I still believed in our group, I still believed in our coaching staff to push this culture and to get these guys to go to the next level. I\u2019m always going to believe in and look for a challenge. And with that opportunity coming, to lose all those guys, I saw it as an opportunity to be even more of a leader and impart even more of my voice and this culture on guys, because that\u2019s when we needed it the most. Did you look at the opportunities to leave and weigh that against what you built here? It\u2019s always a part of the thought process. Because when you walk away from the game, you don\u2019t get those years back. So everybody knows that my last few years have been more from a mentoring part. And you see guys that move on from places they\u2019ve been for a long time for different roles and chances to play. Like, David West leaving Indiana when I never thought he would. You see Vince Carter playing on different teams after he left Toronto, obviously, when you never thought he would. And then you see Tony Parker leave San Antonio when you never thought he would. And then you see guys like myself in situations where they\u2019ve played for so many years, and you never think they\u2019ll leave \u2026 and then they leave. I said to myself, \u2018damn, I get it, I get it.\u2019 Because we can still play and we still want to play, but sometimes organizations move in different directions. It\u2019s not the fault of the organization or the player, it\u2019s just how the business goes sometimes. But for me, being home and being here in this city has always been bigger than basketball. I\u2019ve had a chance to impact this city in ways I never thought. So those are the things I\u2019m most proud of, right up there with my rings and the championships we\u2019ve won. I\u2019ve always seen the bigger picture and played the long game instead of the short game. You guys are off to the best home start in franchise history. But there have been other times, like when the \u201cBig Three\u201d squad started 9-8 in 2010-11 . It would have been easy to dump a coach or overreact, but that didn\u2019t happen. Is that Pat Riley\u2019s influence (or ownership\u2019s) that kept the Heat from making a panic move? We are who we are, man. We are who we are. And we don\u2019t shy away from who we are and what we are. And we understand that it might not be for everybody, but we are who we are. And we\u2019re going to take the hard road and we don\u2019t want anything easy and we\u2019re going to put the work in. We\u2019re going to rely on our foundation, our fundamentals and our culture and we\u2019re going to push through. Can you point to a time or two where life on the court just made sense and flowed for you? I think the first training camp when \u2018Bron and CB and D-Wade all came together, we were on that Navy base \u2026 that was fun. Fun from a competitive standpoint, and from a get better standpoint. Because I really didn\u2019t care what Chris Bosh had done in Toronto, I want to see what you can do here. I don\u2019t care that you averaged 20, you didn\u2019t have to deal with me all 82 games. It was the same thing with D-Wade and LeBron, the way they challenged each other, the way they pushed each other, playing one-on-one every day after practice. That was one of the most competitive and fun overall training camps and experiences in my life. To have an opportunity to break that Miami Heat rebounding record , and to do it here at home against Milwaukee, that was an amazing accomplishment. And then winning those championships, man. That\u2019s what we play for. That\u2019s what you shut off your phone for in the playoffs, you start reading books and disconnect from your kids and start spending more time alone on your off days \u2014 that\u2019s what you do it for. You\u2019ve got to be obsessed a little bit to win a championship. You would think you just have to work hard and have the best team and it will all work out. But it\u2019s not always the best team and the people that work hard, it\u2019s the people willing to give up the most in those times who win championships. Because it\u2019s a lifestyle change. Winning a championship, you have to change your life going into playoff time. You\u2019re not going to go through the same things you do everyday and hang out with your boys and go to dinner and be up all night watching TV. Oh no, when you get into that playoff mode it\u2019s a different ballgame. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Why did he think the Los Angeles Lakers have been so good, so soon this season? \u201cThey\u2019ve got two of the top five players in the world, so \u2026 ,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, politely leaving unspoken the easy \u201cduh\u201d at the end. LeBron James and Anthony Davis would dominate \u201cNBA Jam,\u201d the nostalgic 2-on-2 arcade video game born in the 1990s . It cemented phrases such as \u201cBoomshakalaka!\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s on FIRE!\u201d into the hoops lexicon. And at the height of the NBA\u2019s Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen, Karl Malone-John Stockton, Gary Payton-Shawn Kemp dominance, it helped convince a lot of basketball fans that having two stars was the ticket. That ante got upped to three in the summer of 2007 , when the Boston Celtics corralled Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce for an insta-championship the following spring. James tweaked and perfected the \u201cBig Three\u201d approach in Miami from 2010-14 (with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh). Then he contended and won some more with another pair of All-Star cohorts in Cleveland (Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love).  Part of Oklahoma City\u2019s presumed trouble in getting back to The Finals after their 2012 trip was the subtraction of three (Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden) down to \u201cjust\u201d two. The Golden State Warriors of 2015-19? They were downright gluttonous, going the other direction with at least four stars (Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green) capable of being most franchises\u2019 No. 1.  This past offseason, however, some drifting of talent in free agency and a rash of Warriors injuries brought a resurgence of the dynamic duo in NBA Land. So we got Kawhi Leonard and Paul George with the LA Clippers , Westbrook joining Harden in Houston and Durant and Irving \u2014 eventually \u2014 in Brooklyn . There\u2019s the vision in Philadelphia of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons (with apologies to Tobias Harris), the enthusiasm in Dallas for Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis and the make-or-break challenge in Minnesota facing Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, who have been treated and paid like an elite tandem, anyway. Then there are James and Davis, so good through the first third of 2019-20 that they might be able to win playing 2-on-5 against many Lakers foes. Which circles back to Antetokounmpo and the Bucks, where the concept of a No. 2, a sidekick head-and-shoulders above the others on Milwaukee\u2019s roster, remains \u2026 fuzzy. Last season, as Antetokounmpo earned his Kia Most Valuable Player award leading his team to 60 victories and the Eastern Conference finals , the question \u2014 \u201cWho is Milwaukee\u2019s second-best player?\u201d \u2014 had the multiple-choice answer, \u201cAll of the above.\u201d The leading candidates were smooth-shooting wing Khris Middleton, a \u201cGreek Freak\u201d teammate from the start, and point guard Eric Bledsoe, a powerful if inconsistent force offensively and a first-team All-NBA defender. Cases could be made, too, for center Brook Lopez, a 3-point hoisting rim defender and locker-room anchoring vet. Or even Malcolm Brogdon, another mature presence with a knack for jolting the Bucks\u2019 performances at both ends. Then there were the esoteric answers, such as \u201cthe defense\u201d or \u201ctheir depth.\u201d Milwaukee did lead the NBA last season in defensive rating , opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage , defensive rebound percentage and defending without fouling (FT\/FGA ratio). Its bench was heavy with proven contributors, including stalwarts such as George Hill and Ersan Ilyasova, specialists like Nikola Mirotic and Tony Snell and under-the-radar helpers Sterling Brown, Pat Connaughton and D.J. Wilson. That gave coach Mike Budenholzer gobs of combinations and flexibility, and ways to max out Antetokounmpo\u2019s many skills via different looks. From one in, four out alignments to Giannis as point guard vs. Giannis as center (and everything in between). Of course, Milwaukee got on such a roll last season that \u2014 while they were 12.1 points better than the other teams with Giannis on the court \u2014 the Bucks also were 3.2 points better in the 15 minutes or so he sat each night. So far this season, those numbers are even more impressive: 15.9 with Antetokounmpo, 8.1 when he sits and two minutes less, on average, in his workload (31.2 mpg). Which still doesn\u2019t sufficiently answer the second-best Bucks player question. On paper, it\u2019s Middleton. He is Milwaukee\u2019s No. 2 scorer (18.1 ppg, 40 percent from the arc), he was an All-Star in February and actually is the Bucks\u2019 highest paid player thanks to the five-year, $177 million deal he signed last summer. At $30.6 million, he\u2019s being paid about $5 million more than Antetokounmpo (which will get corrected when\/if the reigning MVP signs the \u201csuper-max\u201d contract that will be offered as soon as he\u2019s eligible on July 1, 2020). Many scouts and fans who watch the Bucks closely default to Middleton as Antetokounmpo\u2019s best available wingman. And yet Bledsoe\u2019s ability to impact games at both ends, often more noticeably than Middleton given his romps to the rim or open-court disruption, argues on many nights for him. For instance, when Middleton was hurt for seven games in November, the point guard upped his scoring average to 18.7 ppg and the Bucks didn\u2019t miss a beat, going 7-0 by an average margin of 11 points. Still, his shaky outside shooting (career 33.6% from 3-point range) and even more so his playoff fades against Boston in 2018 and Toronto last spring keep him from upper echelon sidekick status. Conventional wisdom suggests that, in a perfect Bucks world or on any legit contender, Middleton and Bledsoe would be that team\u2019s third-and fourth-best players, not overreaching as 2 and 2a. Does it matter? Not necessarily, but probably. Over the past 30 NBA seasons, nearly every championship team has sported two or more franchise-caliber players. There are maybe five exceptions: the Rockets in 1994 and \u201995 with Hakeem Olajuwon, the Pistons\u2019 true ensemble in \u201904, the Mavericks of Dirk Nowitzki & Co. in \u201911, the Spurs across all but the first of their five titles and the Raptors last season. The Bucks would be fine if they could achieve San Antonio\u2019s sum-of-the-parts results with one legendary talent in Tim Duncan and strong career-spanning support from there. Of course, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker will be enshrined as Hall of Famers before too long. The same cannot be said at this point of Middleton, of Bledsoe or of any other Bucks players. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long ways to go before this group becomes the \u2018San Antonio Spurs,\u2019\u201d Bucks GM Jon Horst told NBA.com last winter, \u201cbut that\u2019s our goal, to build a team that can compete over a long period of time and win championships. \u201cI think they can become and sustain that. Both Khris and Eric are entering their prime or in their prime. They\u2019re super-high character guys. They are very talented. And they fit.\u201d A harsher lesson from the Lone Star State came in 2007, when Dallas won 67 games but got eliminated in the first round . No one would have blamed Nowitzki if he had vented his frustration over that into a free-agent defection at his next opportunity; only his willingness to stick gave the Mavericks their second chance four years later. That same saga might play out for Antetokounmpo and the Bucks over the next 20 months: If they can\u2019t do better than the six-game swoon to Toronto in the East finals, will he commit well into his 30s to keep trying?  There have been other disappointing instances of cornerstone players surrounded by nice but ultimately insufficient help. Think Garnett for most of his Minnesota run (seven first-round ousters in eight years). Think Derrick Rose and a deep-and-defensive Chicago team\u2019s inability to claw past James. The math facing the Bucks is simple. It might be on display when they meet the Lakers Thursday night at Fiserv Forum (although Bledsoe will be out with a fibula fracture ), and it could be a deciding factor if both teams manage to reach The Finals in June. Either James or Davis can carry L.A. against anybody, for long stretches of games or of the schedule. No one besides Antetokounmpo can reliably do that with the Bucks. One team has two of the top five players in the world. The other has one. * * * Steve Aschburner  has written about the NBA since 1980.

OK, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much. Pelicans vice president of basketball operations David Griffin provided an update on the No. 1 pick on Tuesday, saying the team was \u201creally excited with where he\u2019s at\u201d while also admitting that Williamson is still \u201ca little ways away\u201d. Williamson had been seen getting up shots at practice earlier in the day, which marked the end of his initial six-to-eight-week timetable to return after having surgery on his right knee on Oct. 21. Griffin said Williamson is fully weight bearing at this point and that his teammates really responded to seeing their prized pick back on the court. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to see a setback, it would be now,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThe teammates, the way they responded to him, the joy he has when he\u2019s on the floor is evident. And we\u2019ve obviously needed that.\u201d With Griffin\u2019s admission, you have to think Williamson\u2019s odds of making a real run at Kia Rookie of the Year are a longshot at this point. It\u2019s possible Williamson could have weathered missing 25 games, but missing half the season seems like too much to ask, even for a rookie as talented as Zion. * * * Last week: No. 1 The Grizzlies have had a little resurgence over the past 10 days, winning four of six. They picked up wins over three bottom dwellers, while most notably dropping the Heat on Monday. Morant put up 20 points and 10 assists as Memphis beat the team that dropped them in the season opener. \u201dWe just learned,\u201d Morant said. \u201dI feel like we lost a lot of games late in the fourth quarter. A team would go on a run, and we weren\u2019t able to bounce back from it. \u2026 We\u2019re just learning from our mistakes.\u201d Of course, Morant and the Grizzlies would finish the week by blowing a 24-point lead to OKC , so there are definitely still lessons to be learned. Last week: No. 2 Nunn is keeping the pressure on Morant for the top spot, and he got another big performance in an impressive Heat win. Nunn scored 26 on Wednesday as Miami handed Philly its first home loss of the season . \u201cKendrick made some big-time shots,\u201d said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. \u201cOur young guys were very good tonight. They took a beating in the film session yesterday (after a loss in Memphis on Monday) but they took it on the chin and they produced tonight.\u201d   Last week: No. 4 In four games this week, Herro averaged 14.3 points and 5.5 rebounds but struggled a bit with his shot, hitting at a 31.6% clip. Still, Herro has been key to Miami\u2019s success, as highlighted by fellow NBA.com scribe Sekou Smith , who runs the Kia MVP Ladder (the other, more popular, Ladder). Herro is known for his work ethic and caught Jimmy Butler\u2019s attention. \u201cWhen you constantly have people in this organization talking about how he works and he\u2019s gonna be good, [that he\u2019s] a tough son of a gun. You know, I\u2019m like \u2018OK, let\u2019s see it.\u2019 And then when we meet, he is that. And he\u2019s like, \u2018let\u2019s get in the gym, let\u2019s get in the gym, let\u2019s get in the gym.\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2018I\u2019m with it.\u2019 \u2026 they are turning this kid into a real player. Everybody knows he has the talent and he has that mental edge over a lot of young guys. But teaching him how to work every day \u2026 this organization is perfect for him.\u201d Last week: NR Clarke missed four games with a hip injury, but has been a stud in the four games since his Dec. 11 return. Over that span, he averaged 20.3 points and 6.8 rebounds while shooting at a 70.8% clip (3-for-6 on 3s). Clarke seems to be finding his role, and twice this week he set career highs, scoring 25 Saturday in a win over the Spurs and 27 in a loss to the Thunder on Wednesday. Last week: NR The Knicks are 3-3 since Mike Miller took over for David Fizdale as interim head coach, and Barrett had one of his best games yet in the Knicks\u2019 biggest win of the season. Barrett had a career-high 27 points and six rebounds in New York\u2019s 143-120 rout of Atlanta on Tuesday, and knows a coaching shakeup is just part of the business. \u201cI\u2019m 19 with no pressure on me,\u201d Barrett told The Undefeated. \u201cI go out and play basketball, the game that I love. I am in the NBA. Why would I let something like that mess me up?\u201d If Miller is wise, he\u2019ll give his young guard a long leash and embrace that enthusiasm. Rui Hachimura, Washington Wizards Hachimura, who had started the first 25 games for the Wizards, will miss five games after suffering a groin injury when he was inadvertently kicked by teammate Isaac Bonga. Hachimura had been climbing the Ladder after a stretch of eight straight games scoring in double-digits. The Wizards said the rookie will be re-evaluated after a four-game road trip that ends Dec. 26. PJ Washington, Charlotte Hornets Washington slips out of the Top 5 after a literal tough break. Washington, who is averaging 12.2 points and 5.2 rebounds while shooting 41% on 3s, had surgery for a fractured finger on his right hand. The Hornets haven\u2019t given a timetable for his return, but speculation has him missing at least through Christmas and likely beyond. DeAndre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks Hunter\u2019s putting up decent scoring numbers, but his shooting has been up and down. In three games this week, he averaged 15.0 points on 37.8% shooting, 2-for-15 on 3-pointers. Jaxson Hayes, New Orleans Pelicans Hayes continues to be one of the best rebounders in this rookie class. In four games this week, Hayes grabbed 5.8 per game while scoring 8.3 points in 22.6 minutes. Hayes\u2019 energy off the bench continues to be big for the Pelicans, even though his numbers don\u2019t necessarily pop off the page. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 18 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

It\u2019s been 26 years since we\u2019ve seen two teams with four or fewer losses match up this late in a season. ( The only other occurrence was on Dec. 28, 1993, when the 23-3 Rockets beat the 20-3 SuperSonics in Seattle.) Lakers-Bucks is just one half of a blockbuster TNT doubleheader as the Houston Rockets visit the LA Clippers ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) to close things out. There will be Kia MVPs, superstars and All-Stars galore on the floor for these games. All four teams have their sights on the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. So even though each matchup is just one game in each team\u2019s 82-game marathon, there is no better test at this stage of the season than a best-on-best showdown. In advance of TNT\u2019s Thursday night showdown, we\u2019re setting the table for the feast. * * * Why you should be watching: The Bucks\u2019 winning streak was halted at 18 games Monday , when the Dallas Mavericks (playing without Luka Doncic) knocked them off. The Lakers saw their 14-game road winning streak end Tuesday in Indiana , when they played without Davis (ankle). This game is a reset game for both teams and a chance, as Lakers guard Avery Bradley said, to \u201cstart another streak.\u201d The sheer star power on the floor \u2014 the All-Star Davis, the four-time Kia MVP LeBron James and reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 is enough to make this one a must-see. We\u2019re only guaranteed to see these teams match up twice. The only way we\u2019ll get more is if they both make The Finals. Don\u2019t take this game for granted. Keep an eye on: Davis and Kyle Kuzma are both battling ankle injuries. If they can\u2019t go, someone else will draw the defensive assignment on Antetokounmpo. Seeing the two most dynamic two-way bigs in the league go head-to-head all night turns the heat up on a game that doesn\u2019t need any extra fire. There will be all sorts of speculation about Davis\u2019 status until we get the official word. It will be hard to focus on this game without dreaming about what kind of fireworks would result in Giannis and AD going at it. The stat to know (from John Schuhmann): The Bucks and Lakers rank first and second, respectively, in points in the paint differential by a wide margin. Much of that has to do with their work defensively as anything. The Bucks have outscored their opponents by 14.4 points in the paint and have only been outscored in the paint three times in their 28 games. The Lakers have outscored their opponents by 10.1 ppg and have been outscored in the paint just four times in their 28 games. For perspective on just how far ahead of the rest of the league they are, Brooklyn is third in points in the paint differential \u2026 at +6.4. * * * Why you should be watching: James Harden is chasing history, leading the league in scoring at a ridiculous 38.9 ppg . That\u2019s an affront to the Clippers\u2019 defensive sensibilities. And you know good and well Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Patrick Beverley have no intention of allowing Harden to have his way with them on this big stage. Remember, too, that Harden lit the Clippers up for 47 points in a Nov. 13 home win and 37 points in a Nov. 22 road loss. This a statement game for two Western Conference powers trying to establish themselves in the pecking order, while also continuing to integrate new stars into their mix. The history of all the stars involved \u2014 not to mention they all have Southern California roots \u2014 always makes for an entertaining game and atmosphere when they face off at Staples Center. Keep an eye on: For all of the attention devoted to trying to slow Harden down, it\u2019s odd that the Clippers have used Beverley to defend him most in their previous two matchups. No team in the league can boast the sizable perimeter defensive firepower the Clippers have with Leonard, George, Maurice Harkless and JaMychal Green. Yet coach Doc Rivers hasn\u2019t gone exclusively with one of them against the NBA\u2019s most difficult individual matchup. Maybe tonight is the night that changes. The stat to know (from John Schuhmann): Ben McLemore has 222 total field goal attempts and 188 3-point attempts. None of those 222 have come from the midrange (between the paint and 3-point line). On the flip side, Russell Westbrook has taken 114 of the Rockets\u2019 151 midrange shots (no other Rocket has attempted more than 11). You might need a codebreaker to figure out the defensive plan for the Rockets come the playoffs, because no other team plays the way coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s crew does. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

But for his opponent on Thursday night, a career-best season is less than expected. LeBron James will turn 35 on Dec. 30, but that hasn\u2019t slowed him down during his 17th season in the league . The four-time NBA MVP is averaging a career-high 10.6 assists this season as the leader of the Lakers\u2019 top-5 offense. In addition, he\u2019s shooting a career-high 6.2 3-pointers per game to go with 25.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.3 steals. The evolution of LeBron\u2019s dominance is one of the most impressive feats in NBA history. And it\u2019s something Giannis hopes to emulate during his career. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s one of my goals \u2026 to be able to play at a high level for the next 10 years,\u201d Giannis said after shootaround on Wednesday. \u201cBut [LeBron\u2019s] about to turn 35 this month and he\u2019s moving like that, playing like that, playing smart \u2026 it\u2019s insane what he\u2019s able to do. \u201cBut he\u2019s LeBron James, you know. He\u2019s different, he\u2019s an alien, so \u2026 you expect it from him.\u201d The Lakers and Bucks are tied for the NBA\u2019s best record at 24-4. The matchup on Thursday will provide an opportunity for one of these title contenders to earn a statement victory before the new year. \u201cThe Lakers are one of the best teams in the league,\u201d Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a test for us. [\u2026] But as long as we have the mindset to get better, we will be fine.\u201d The action in Milwaukee will tip off with a special hour-long pregame show on TNT at 7 ET.

According to the team, Conley reinjured his left hamstring during Tuesday\u2019s game against the Magic. He will be reevaluated during the team\u2019s upcoming 3-game road trip. Per Shams Charania and Tony Jones of The Athletic, Conley is expected to miss multiple games with the injury. Prior to last night\u2019s game against the Magic, Conley had missed the past five games with a tight hamstring. He left Tuesday\u2019s game in the third quarter when the pain returned, finishing with seven points and six assists. Charania reports the Jazz and Conley will re-evaluate the injury day by day with the plan of being safe with it long term. Utah traded for Conley in the offseason in hopes of shoring up a weak spot in its lineup. However, Conley has struggled to adjust to the Jazz system and is averaging near-career lows in scoring (13.2 ppg), shooting (36.5%), assists (4.6 apg) and steals (0.7 spg). Joe Ingles, who has primarily been a reserve this season, began starting when Conley was out and has been scoring and shooting at a much higher clip. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds on Tuesday vs. Orlando and will likely continue in that role going forward. The Jazz are 16-11 and No. 6 in the Western Conference, trailing the Houston Rockets and Denver Nuggets by two games in the standings.

The good news is Embiid, who missed that game in Brooklyn because of an upper respiratory illness, is set to go against the Heat ( 7 ET, ESPN ). If you like play on the interior, this one should be an interesting chess match: Embiid leads the NBA in total post ups and points off post ups while the Heat allow the sixth-fewest amount of shots from 6 feet or less. 2. Struggles continue in New Orleans Bright spots have been hard to find for the Pelicans lately. One did emerge last night, as top executive David Griffin said rookie Zion Williamson is progressing nicely in his injury rehab \u2014 but his debut remains \u201ca ways away.\u201d That little tidbit came during a 108-101 loss , which was New Orleans\u2019 13th straight defeat (which extends the longest drought in team history). A trip to Minnesota is next ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and the Pelicans could catch a break, perhaps, if Karl-Anthony Towns (sprained ankle) is unable to suit up . 3. Another upset win for Mavs? In halting the Bucks\u2019 18-game win streak Monday, Dallas showed that \u2014 even sans Luka Doncic \u2014 it can hang with the NBA\u2019s elite. The flip side, of course, is that upsets happen in the NBA and Milwaukee simply fell victim to that adage. Proof of contender-ship, though, could come through for Dallas should it win in Boston tonight ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). Kristaps Porzingis, who played hero vs. Milwaukee, could be looking for payback against Boston: he was 1-for-11 and had four points in a 116-106 loss to the Celtics on Nov. 11 . 4.

Shane Keisel said there was nothing racial about his heckling during the game in March and that the high-profile incident has cost him his job and exposed him to online threats, according to the suit filed Monday in a state court in Utah. The Jazz, however, said the team investigated the episode that ignited a national conversation about race and fan behavior and stands by the decision to bar him from the arena. The organization will \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself from the lawsuit, said Frank Zang, senior vice president of communications for the Jazz parent company, Larry H. Miller Sports and Entertainment. Westbrook was fined $25,000 by the NBA after video surfaced of him directing vulgar comments at Keisel in the crowd. Then a point guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder who had had other in-game exchanges with fans, Westbrook was shown along the sideline using threatening language that also referred to Keisel\u2019s girlfriend, who was at the game. Westbrook said at the time that he had been provoked by the fan who told him to \u201cget down on your knees like you used to.\u201d Westbrook said he would never abuse a woman, but that Keisel\u2019s racial taunts went over the line, especially after past disrespectful comments from other Utah fans. His stance was backed by Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who said it wasn\u2019t the first time a racially motivated event occurred at a Jazz game. The Jazz banned Keisel the day after the game, saying there is no room for personal attacks or disrespect. In the lawsuit, Keisel acknowledged heckling Westbrook and telling him in a mocking way to \u201ctake care of his knees\u201d because the point guard had them wrapped in towels while he sat on the bench. But he denies making the comment that Westbrook said he did. Keisel is seeking a public apology, $68 million in damages for himself and $32 million for his girlfriend, who was with him.

When you\u2019ve played as long as he has, 17 seasons and counting, at as high a level as he has, your availability at this stage of a career, becomes paramount for all things. The Lakers are championship contenders so long as LeBron and Anthony Davis, who are both featured prominently on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder , remain healthy and operating at the elite level they\u2019ve shown this season. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many games I\u2019ve got left in my career,\u201d James said after the Lakers topped the Atlanta Hawks at State Farm Arena. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many kids show up to come see me play. \u2026 That\u2019s my obligation. My obligation is to play.\u201d LeBron\u2019s reminder holds true for a veteran and all-time great nearing his 35th birthday later this month, as well as a youngster on the other end of that spectrum chasing that status. A player like 20 year old Luka Doncic, the Dallas Mavericks wunderkind who is navigating his way through the first significant injury absence of his NBA career. The Mavericks snapped the Bucks\u2019 win streak at 18 games without Doncic on Monday night. But playing without their catalyst for the foreseeable future is a daunting task for a team that has been on of the biggest surprises of this season. It\u2019s yet another reminder that player availability, superstars and role players alike, remains one of the most critical components in any team\u2019s success matrix (just ask the Golden State Warriors). How it impacts Doncic\u2019s position on the Ladder is hard to predict. Much like his status to play, it\u2019s to be determined. CP3 never surrenders : The opinions were fast and furious in regards to what role Chris Paul would play in Oklahoma City after he was traded to the Thunder in the offseason. Clearly, he plans on doing the same thing he\u2019s always done, and that\u2019s playing with the chip on his shoulder and pushing his team in whatever way he deems necessary to get the job done. He uncorked a vintage CP3 performance in Monday\u2019s win over Chicago . He nailed five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter as the Thunder rallied from 26 points down. Raise your hand if you thought we\u2019d hit mid-December with the Thunder in the top eight of the Western Conference playoff chase. MVP Week : With the Bucks falling to the Mavericks, the Lakers\u2019 seven-game win streak becomes the league\u2019s current best mark. They\u2019ll be tested tonight in Indiana. Should they survive that test, they\u2019ll face an ornery Giannis Antetokounmpo-led Bucks team Thursday night in a showdown of the league\u2019s two best teams. The matchup will showcase three of the top five players on the Ladder in a blockbuster TNT doubleheader that features three more MVP candidates when James Harden and the Houston Rockets play Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and the Los Angeles Clippers. Get your popcorn ready! Player(s) of the Week : LeBron earning top honors in the West is no surprise. Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo, however, has been one of best surprises of this early season. He gives the Heat back-to-back Eastern Conference honorees (Jimmy Butler passed the baton). Adebayo\u2019s been outstanding all season. He\u2019s playing like an All-Star and has provided the steady post presence on both ends that the Heat lacked before he took over those duties as a full-time starter. Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . *** From:  Van Miller Dec. 16 | 4:52 p.m. Hello Sekou. I\u2019m Van Miller, coming from Charlottesville, Virginia, and I really think Giannis is having a great season. But he does not deserve the top spot. Despite his recent injury, that spot goes to Luka Doncic. His numbers have been ridiculous, and he\u2019s putting on an MVP-worthy show. Also, Pascal Siakam deserves to be up there, despite Harden\u2019s ridiculous point totals. I think he has the ball more than he should, and shoots a ridiculously high amount compared to his fellow teammates. In my opinion, the MVP ladder should look like this: 1. Luka Doncic 2. LeBron James 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Pascal Siakam 5. James Harden * * * My response: Charlottsville is one of my favorite cities Van, so you\u2019ve got my full attention (if you promise to send me a care package from Bodo\u2019s Bagels I\u2019ll be forever grateful). I\u2019m picking up on this anti-Giannis vibe that has me confused. Luka\u2019s been amazing. No one is disputing that. And even with his current injury situation, I can\u2019t see him tumbling down the Ladder. But don\u2019t we have to acknowledge what Giannis is doing for the Bucks? He went off for 48 Monday night as the Bucks\u2019 win-streak ended at 18 games against a Luka-less Mavericks team. Trivializing his impact on everything going on in Milwaukee is something I\u2019m simply not comfortable with, not at all.  From:  Alexander Roedeske Dec. 13 | 12:06 p.m. \ufeff I agree with the Kia MVP leaderboard you have so far, but at least give Brandon Ingram credit for what he\u2019s doing in New Orleans! Since Zion has been out from injury Brandon and Jrue Holiday have been great! Ingram has been posting 25 points and 7 rebounds a night. Yes, the Pelicans have been struggling to win but he\u2019s still putting up good numbers. He may not be on the leaderboard yet, but at least give him credit for what he\u2019s been doing. Sincerely, Xander * * * My response: I hear you Xander. Ingram has certainly been one of the bright spots in what\u2019s been a tough start to the season for the Pelicans. You\u2019re focusing on numbers that suggest an All-Star case while there are another set of numbers (the Pelicans are 6-21) that disqualify him from any serious MVP conversation. But consider this credit given for what he\u2019s doing.  From:  Ryan Kaplan Dec. 13 | 11:35 a.m. Hey Sekou! I love your list and I agree with almost everything on it, but I do believe the MVP trophy has a little more to do with narrative than most of us would care to admit. Due to this, I put Luka Doncic above Giannis at least for the moment. Both teams are on a roll and they are each the primary reason for it. And even though I completely understand why people would disagree with me, if Luka\u2019s stats go up just barely to a triple double, I believe narrative gives him the edge in that regard. * * * My response: I agree with you Ryan, narrative does play a bigger role than most of us want to admit. And if Luka comes back from this injury setback locked into triple-double form, he\u2019ll be in the mix right up to the finish. That said, it\u2019s going to take more than narrative for him or anyone else to knock off Giannis if he continues on his current pace.  From:  August M. Dec. 13 | 2:15 p.m. Sekou: My rankings remain borderline identical. I might possibly flip-flop James Harden and LeBron for 3 and 4 ONLY because LeBron\u2019s contribution would rank a tad bit lower without Anthony Davis. Vice versa for Davis. Pascal Siakam sneaks up to No. 5 based on this logic, dropping AD to 6 and Jimmy Butler to 7.  Due to load management, Kawhi should be removed from this list. PG13 needs to play 5 to 10 more games before moving up. Have a safe and happy holiday season. * * * My response:  Great minds think alike August, well, for the most part. I\u2019ve got LeBron ahead of Harden without any reservations. Siakam is one of the tougher guys to rank this season, given his new role as the Raptors\u2019 No. 1 option. He\u2019s new to the profile (of team\u2019 best player), and perhaps that\u2019s why it seems like he\u2019s not getting the respect he deserves. I have to wrestle with his fit every week, am I not recognizing just how good he\u2019s been or does he fit right outside of that top five? We\u2019ll see where he fits in Friday\u2019s update. Oh and Happy Holidays to you as well. From:  Luke Zwayne Dec. 13 | 4:27 p.m. Hello Mr. Sekou, Before I read the MVP Ladder every week, I like to form a ladder of my own in my head. And after I saw this week\u2019s edition, I thought this was your best installment of the ladder this season. I think the top four players are each having amazing seasons, but you hit the nail on the head when putting Giannis first. The Bucks are on an insane run and he\u2019s the root to their success. I also love how you put Jimmy G. Buckets at No. 6. The Heat are soaring and Jimmy\u2019s confidence and will to win rubs off on everyone around him. Jimmy is making everyone great. Thank you for not overhyping Joel. I think the ten spot is good for him, but like Shaq and the guys on Inside the NBA said, he should (and has the skill set to) be putting up 28-30 points a night. And I\u2019m expecting him to climb that ladder as the season goes on. I could say a lot more, but that\u2019s all for now. Thanks Sekou!  * * * My response:  Thank you, Luke. And next time, you\u2019ve got to share your list with the rest of us. As for the absence of hype surrounding Embiid, it\u2019s not up to me. It\u2019s up to him. When he plays the way he has recently, it\u2019s easy to see why the steam on his hype train would be on full tilt. I do believe him to be the most talented big man in the game right now. But until his grind matches all that potential, he won\u2019t push anyone out of the way on the Ladder. The Hall of Famers on his case have made sound argument about where his game lacks polish. It\u2019s not a difficult concept. He should dominate on a consistent basis. But he doesn\u2019t \u2026 not yet at least. Respect For Harden?  From:  Vonsedrick Chapple Dec. 13 | 11:59 a.m. How is Luka Doncic No. 2 and James Harden No. 4? Nobody in the league gets double-teamed like Harden. * * * My response: Luka and Harden are in the thick of things, so it\u2019s hard to comprehend these arguments that either one of them is being disrespected on the Ladder. Top five is where they both belong.  From:  Dylan Miller Dec. 13 | 5:38 p.m. LeBron is the focal point of the Lakers, so is Luka with the Mavs. But LeBron is the No. 1 seed and has the best record in the league. LeBron deserves to be higher than Doncic. Here is the leaderboard in my opinion: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Luka Doncic 4. James Harden 5. Anthony Davis 6. Kemba Walker 7. Pascal Siakam 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Karl-Anthony Towns 10. Jimmy Butler * * * My response: To each his own, Dylan. And given the way he\u2019s operating right now, the case for LeBron at No. 2 is valid. The funny thing is we all have the same basic group of guys in our respective top 10s, we just differ on the specific order.  From: Edward Fernandez Dec. 15 | 3:50 p.m. I could not disagree more. My list: 1. Harden \u2013 Having a historic season, what he is doing is being taken for granted and without him the team is deep under .500 2. Doncic \u2013 Having a historic year, the team has former All-Stars and good supporting cast 3. Giannis \u2013 Having a great season, but is surrounded by studs. The team is a playoff team without him. 4 \u2013 5. Davis or James \u2013 The Lakers are loaded. Without Davis the Lakers are still a Top 5 team in the West and same goes for LeBron. Hard to to put either one of these guys in the Top 5. I have Karl-Anthony Towns and Kemba at 4 and 5. * * * My response:  As vehement as you are about disagreeing with my list, Edward, I am just as opposed to your blatant disregard for what Giannis has done in Milwaukee. If he\u2019s not in your top two, then we have to simply agree to disagree. How any unbiased observer ranks two guys ahead of Giannis this season is watching a different season than what I\u2019m watching.  From: Eyal Ankava Dec. 15 | 12:28 p.m. I wanted to ask why not to publish every week a list of the Sixth Man of the Year candidates? In my opinion, it\u2019s a very important tittle and every year there are more than a few candidates who create good competition and deserve the recognition for their important roles. (It might even give them an extra push to play harder and better.) Thank you for listening and for all your knowledge and passion about the NBA. I always enjoy reading your articles. Eyal Ankava, from Jerusalem. * * * My response: Eyal, you might be on to something. We\u2019ve got the MVP and Rookie Ladders up and running, perhaps a weekly look at the Sixth Man race (we\u2019ll just call it the Lou Williams Invitational) does make sense. I\u2019m reaching out to the bosses to inquire about your idea. You might have to be responsible for the unofficial Sixth Man Ladder until we get clearance. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle initially told reporters there would be no further updates until Wednesday and Doncic wouldn\u2019t travel to Milwaukee. Dallas posted one of the most impressive wins of the season on Monday night without Doncic, ending the Bucks\u2019 18-game winning streak with a 120-116 win. Carlisle indicated Doncic is \u201cresponding well to treatment\u201d and is no longer utilizing a walking boot or crutches, though he\u2019ll miss Wednesday\u2019s home game against the Celtics. The Mavericks star did not return after spraining his right ankle less than two minutes into Saturday\u2019s home game. He had two points and one rebound before the injury with 10:20 left in the first quarter. X-rays were negative, but Carlisle said after the game he doesn\u2019t expect Doncic to play in Monday\u2019s game at Milwaukee. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski later reported that the sprain is being described as moderate, with colleague Tim MacMahon adding that Doncic had already begun rehabilitation efforts during the game. Doncic, 20, has established himself as one of the NBA\u2019s best players in his second season, averaging 30.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 9.3 assists entering Saturday\u2019s action.

Bad enough that the Mavericks were headed into the shredder against the reigning Eastern Conference champions. With the NBA\u2019s reigning Most Valuable Player. On the road. With Milwaukee barreling along on an 18-game winning streak. All that was happening regardless. But then Doncic went down Saturday in Miami with a sprained right ankle, an injury projected to sideline the marvelous, triple-threat 20-year-old perhaps through Christmas. For what it seemed to mean to Dallas\u2019 chances Monday, Doncic\u2019s first name might as well have been Jenga. So, naturally, Dallas beat Milwaukee 120-116 to snap the winning streak, improve to an unlikely 10-2 on the road, stake itself to a 1-0 mark without its young star and gate attraction and steal a little luster from the Bucks\u2019 network-televised showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers , the West\u2019s juggernaut and the league\u2019s rapidly restored glamour team. \u201cI mean, the NBA is crazy,\u201d said Dallas\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 26 points, nine in the fourth quarter and six on a pair of deep 3-pointers on consecutive trips down the floor after the Bucks had crept within 99-92 with nearly seven minutes left. That lead got up to 15 before Milwaukee whittled it down but good: From 110-95 with 3:13 left to 114-103 with 39.7 seconds to go, at which point the Bucks flirted with the improbable by outscoring Dallas 13-5. That made it 119-116. Giannis Antetokounmpo, at his MVP best and a little overworked, finished with 48 points but missed his and-one free throw at 5.2 seconds. Teammate Sterling Brown grabbed the miss and might have sent it to the perimeter for a chance to tie, but he went up with the ball only to have Porzingis block his layup. The streak was over. The Bucks, whose previous loss had come way back on Nov. 8 at Utah, had been better than their opponent on 18 consecutive nights. The Mavericks were better on this one. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this league for a long time,\u201d Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said, \u201cand an 18-game winning streak is a spectacular demonstration of how good a team is.\u201d Carlisle had talked beforehand about his team\u2019s need to move the ball and rely on multiple creators to pick up slack in Doncic\u2019s absence (29.3 ppg, 9.6 rpg and 8.9 apg is serious slack). They got that from Jalen Brunson (13 points, 11 assists), from Seth Curry (26 points, four assists), and from Delon Wright (13 points). Even with Brunson\u2019s production shifted into the starting lineup, Dallas\u2019 bench scored 56 points, an 11-point advantage over Milwaukee\u2019s subs. Carlisle and his players had talked beforehand, too, about hitting the Bucks hard from tip, sticking them with an uncustomary early deficit. Milwaukee, after all, came in averaging 29.5 points in first quarters, outscoring teams by 4.6 points on average (a third of its record-pace 13.6 point differential). The Bucks are 17-2 when leading after the first quarter. But they trailed 36-22 12 minutes into this one. The Bucks scored 40 in the fourth thanks to their furious scramble at the end, but Dallas countered with 34. The Mavericks outshot Milwaukee across the board \u2014 overall, from the arc and from the line \u2014 and somehow managed to give up only six points off its 14 turnovers. Dallas had offered a glimpse of its resiliency Saturday after Doncic got hurt in the opening minutes. Gathering themselves at halftime, they outscored the Heat 62-39 to force overtime. This time, they had 48 hours and a whole game with which to work. \u201cWe\u2019re missing a lot of points, a lot of playmaking without Luka,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move the ball a little bit more. We played with the same attitude we have every other game.\u201d The Bucks claimed to have done likewise, resisting any temptation \u2014 they said \u2014 to look past the wounded Mavs to their ballyhooed clash Thursday with LeBron James, Anthony Davis & Co. So now they\u2019ve won 18 of their past 19 and still have matched the franchise mark for best start after 28 games (shared with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s squads in 1971 and 1973). Milwaukee was without its starting point guard, too \u2014 Eric Bledsoe missed his second game with a right shin fracture \u2014 and Bledsoe\u2019s all-NBA defense was notably absent. Brunson got his first double-double of 2019-20 and Curry reached 20 points for only the second time this season. But there was no beating up the Bucks for this one, not after the 18 that came before. They went 7-0 when Khris Middleton was out, beat New Orleans on Wednesday when Antetokounmpo sat with a sore right thigh and even felt buoyed by Monday\u2019s flurry near the end. A team whose season will rise or fall on what happens in May, and possibly June, finds its challenges and bright spots where it can. This was that, in a don\u2019t-cry-that-it\u2019s-over, smile-that-it-happened way. \u201cI\u2019ll be quiet probably,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, imaging his drive home from Fiserv Forum late Monday. \u201cBe quiet and not say much to my mom and my girlfriend. But at the end of the day, my dad said this and my brother always says, \u2018To be better, you\u2019ve got to face adversity.\u2019 Starts with the leader of the team to the last player. \u201cIt\u2019s good. You get better.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner  has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But the marquee pairing for this week\u2019s edition of can\u2019t-miss matchups \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo against Luka Doncic \u2014 won\u2019t happen Monday because Doncic is out for a key stretch for the Mavs with a sprained ankle. The upcoming week still shapes up to be a competitive one for Antetokounmpo, who\u2019s also set for a TNT matchup on Thursday against four-time MVP LeBron James: Last regular season meeting: Mar. 1, 2019 \u201cWashed King\u201d and the Lakers close out a five-game road trip with this Thursday night meeting, and thanks to resurgent play from James, Los Angeles finished last week with its undefeated road record still intact after handing Miami its first home loss of the season on Friday. James\u2019 teams have dominated the series against Antetounmpo with a 14-4 record, but the Bucks star has captured victories in two of the last three meetings. James committed seven first-half turnovers in addition to missing seven of his first 11 shots before turning things around Friday in the win over Miami with 17 points and nine assists in the second half alone. This game represents the first of a TNT doubleheader that features two of our can\u2019t-miss matchups. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 23, 2019 The former teammates meet up for the second time this season, and hopefully this matchup is more compelling than the Nov. 23 Philadelphia victory. The last time these two clashed, they combined for 15 points with four turnovers. When they actually guarded each other, neither of them scored a point and combined to shoot 0-for-4 . Butler and Simmons matched up against each other more than any other two players on the floor. There should be some incentive for Butler to perform in his second game back in Philadelphia since departing in free agency, considering the crowd at the Wells Fargo Center booed him in the last game between these teams. In a recent interview with ESPN, Butler said \u201ca lot of things happened on the inside\u201d that led to his departure from the 76ers, adding that \u201cyou never really know what happened.\u201d Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 22, 2019 Two more players from our Kia MVP Ladder check in for the nightcap of a TNT doubleheader with Leonard holding a slight advantage (12-11) in the series between the teams. Harden made history to close out last week, becoming the first player to put together back-to-back 50-point games with 10 3-pointers made in Friday\u2019s win over the Orlando Magic. Harden has produced seven 50-point outings this season, including four in the past eight games, which is significant considering the rest of the league owns a total of five 50-point performances. Meanwhile, Leonard took Saturday off to rest but should be ready to roll for this one. One concern: Leonard finished last week averaging five turnovers over his last four outings. Harden has won four of the last five matchups with Leonard. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Jan. 31, 2018 With Luka Doncic expected to miss time due to an ankle injury, Porzingis needs to step up to shoulder a larger load offensively. Dallas enters the week ranked No. 12 in the league in points in the paint (19.7) and fourth in rebounds (47.8). Interestingly, the Mavericks reportedly are looking for another big to play alongside Porzingis. Horford, meanwhile, returned Sunday after missing Philadelphia\u2019s last two games due to left knee soreness and left hamstring tightness and looked somewhat rusty, shooting 5 of 15 from the field and 0 of 6 from 3-point range. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said it will take Horford some time to get acclimated to playing extended minutes again, but 27 minutes after a two-game absence represents a decent start for the 33 year old. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Mar. 15, 2019  Ayton will be four days removed from a 25-game suspension when the Suns host the Rockets. So, it\u2019s unclear what version of Ayton we\u2019ll see as Suns coach Monty Williams has mentioned the team will ease the big back into action. Williams has said Phoenix will need around 10 games with Ayton to see where they are as a team. So, this matchup definitely counts as one of them with Ayton going head-to-head with Capela, who has pulled down at least 10 rebounds in 16 consecutive outings. Ayton turned over the ball seven times when he last matched up with Capela, who hit 6 of 9 that night for 14 points. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Mar. 21, 2019  Two of the NBA\u2019s young, exciting guards meet up in what should be an electric matchup. With Mike Conley missing time due to a sore hamstring, Utah needs Mitchell to be a facilitator just as much as a scorer. Young, meanwhile, despite putting up strong numbers offensively this season is reportedly frustrated, and simply needs more help from the supporting cast in Atlanta, which entered the week having dropped 16 of its last 20 games. Young committed five turnovers the last time he and Mitchell clashed, with the Hawks coming away with the victory. Mitchell enters the week averaging 28 points over his last three games.

The Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns were in the good group for a while, and the Brooklyn Nets have recovered from a slow start to join the other 12 teams with winning records.

Some teams in the lower group, like the Detroit Pistons and Sacramento Kings, have shown signs of life. But it might take a while before we have eight teams with winning records in either conference.

All of the lights, the crowded locker room scene after games, the stands filled with Lakers fans in arena after arena. The grown men wearing head-to-toe Lakers garb. Fans waiting outside of the team hotel trying to get a glimpse of LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the rest of the NBA\u2019s greatest road show. It\u2019s all a part of the experience. And still, Green cracks up laughing every time he thinks about it. This is a lot to digest, even for a player who has played on the biggest stage. Earlier in his career, Green played with LeBron in Cleveland. He battled James for championships twice wearing a Spurs uniform, going 1-1 in those matchups. And he won a title last season in Toronto, so that electric feeling of performing when the lights shine brightest remains fresh. But this \u2014 crazy as it sounds \u2014 feels unique. \u201cIt does seem different and that\u2019s because this is America\u2019s team,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t understand that until you become a part of it. Plus you\u2019ve got two superstars \u2014 one the greatest superstar of his era, who is arguably the greatest of all time and been doing it for 17 years. That you are a part of that and this organization and all it stands for \u2026 let\u2019s just say it magnifies everything.\u201d The Lakers are riding high, winners of seven straight games overall and 14 straight on the road after Sunday night\u2019s 101-96 victory over the Hawks at State Farm Arena. It\u2019s the second-longest streak road winning streak in franchise history. The stakes and the crowds just keep getting bigger. This Lakers road show makes stops in Indiana ( Tuesday, 7 ET ; NBA TV) and Milwaukee ( Thursday, 8 ET ; TNT), a contest that will pit the hottest two teams in the league. Giannis Antetokounmpo and his Bucks against LeBron, AD and these Lakers in prime time? It\u2019s the type of night veterans like Green relish, knowing that they\u2019ll get to test themselves against the best of the best. \u201cWe know the magnifying glass is much bigger this season, but for good reason,\u201d Green said. \u201cEspecially when you have the superstars you have and you\u2019re winning games, that\u2019s not a bad thing. We don\u2019t overlook anyone or anything. We know the schedule. We\u2019d prefer to fly under the radar like any team, but we know it\u2019s tough being in one of the big-market cities and in an organization that is historic in the people, places and things that have happened, just so many great things. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to feed off of it in a positive way. Only look at the positives, eliminate the negatives. Head down and keep grinding away, that\u2019s how we\u2019re handling this.\u201d It\u2019s made much easier on nights like this one, when LeBron and AD play at the height of their powers, against a game but overmatched Hawks team. LeBron put on a show, scoring 23 of his 32 points before halftime and finishing with 13 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks. \u201cHe was spectacular,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cHe had some all-time clips, the drop pass to Dwight [Howard], there were a few of them. Obviously, he was terrific, and he was a huge part of the win.\u201d James was the catalyst as usual, and made sure everyone got in on the fun \u2014 check the wicked between-the-legs assist of a Dwight Howard dunk Vogel\u2019s referenced \u2014 during what turned into an emotional weekend of him watching his oldest son shine in a game against his alma mater in Ohio Saturday night. He was locked in early on against the Hawks \u2014 not that he hasn\u2019t been all season \u2014 and playing to a crowd that loved every single second of the show. \u201cSometimes plays just develop on their own, and it\u2019s my job as the ball handler to see the whole floor,\u201d James said. \u201cDwight was trailing down the middle, I caught a glimpse of him in my peripheral and just tried to look off the defense and saw big fella trailing down the middle. I just tried to put it on time and on target.\u201d Davis stayed locked in as well, finishing with 27 points, 13 rebounds three assists and two blocks. The Lakers used their size advantage to dominate the paint, \u2014 outrebounding the Hawks 56-42 and outscoring them 54-34. They also ran their record to 10-0 when holding opponents under 100 points and improved to 8-1 against Eastern Conference opponents. Not even a season-high 22 turnovers could derail them against a Hawks team that stayed in it until the very end, lead by 30 points from explosive point guard Trae Young. \u201cIt was a good fight,\u201d Young said. \u201cLeBron was LeBron tonight. And also AD (was AD). It\u2019s tough whenever they\u2019re going at a high level. They\u2019re both great players. If they were just half of what they usually are, maybe we\u2019d get the win. But they were just being their best selves tonight.\u201d What\u2019s becoming increasingly clear is just how effective the supporting cast round LeBron and Davis has become. Green sank the free throws to seal the win. \u201cThe rest of the team is perfectly fit around those two stars,\u201d Young said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got guys around him them like Rondo, Avery Bradley and other starters like Danny and (Kentavious) Caldwell-Pope. Those guys can play. They\u2019re no slouches and they\u2019re great players too.\u201d And there will be nights when the highlight machine isn\u2019t going to carry the Lakers to the finish. For all of the flashy plays they make, they\u2019ll need to be able to grind defensively when necessary to finish what they\u2019ve started. \u201cWe know that is how you win championships,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAny team that wins championships is usually top five in defense, and we want to make sure that we hang our hats on defense. We are not going to be able to shoot the ball well every night, but we can defend every night. \u201cThat is nothing but energy and effort, and everybody on this team wants to play defense. It\u2019s contagious when you have a lot of guys that want to play defense.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The reigning rookie of the year sprained his right ankle in the opening minutes of a 122-118 overtime loss to Miami , the first of five straight games for the Mavericks against the teams that entered Sunday with the five best records in the Eastern Conference. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said he didn\u2019t expect Doncic to play Monday in Milwaukee against reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, although he stressed it wasn\u2019t a medical opinion. X-rays were negative. The rally from a 24-point deficit to a four-point lead late in the fourth quarter against the Heat was probably the most encouraging thing to happen to the resurgent Mavericks this season. But the reality was they still lost and have games against East contenders every other day through next Sunday. Three of the remaining four are on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be opportunities, a lot of touches for a lot of people,\u201d said guard J.J. Barea, who played in just six of the first 24 games but figures to have more nights like his 12 points in 13 minutes against the Heat as long as Doncic is sidelined. \u201cJust got to be ready. With him here, with him not here, we\u2019ve still got to start the games better.\u201d Doncic was coming off the latest of many eye-opening games this season. A former teenage star in Spain, the Slovenian wowed the crowd in Mexico City with a pre-game speech in flawless Spanish before scoring 41 points with 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 122-111 win over Detroit. Two nights later, t he 20-year-old was on the ground between rows of fans behind a basket less than two minutes into the game, clutching his ankle after landing on the foot of Miami\u2019s Kendrick Nunn on a drive. Doncic had left the arena, presumably to get an MRI, and wasn\u2019t available to comment after the game. \u201cObviously, we lose a guy that\u2019s a great player,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for how long. We got to circle the wagons with the guys that we have and play like we did in the second half. Pretty simple.\u201d Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 18 of his 28 points in the second half, including several clutch 3-pointers. But he was shut out in overtime, getting just one shot and missing a 3. Kristaps Porzingis, the other half of Dallas\u2019 star European pairing along with Doncic, had 22 points and 14 rebounds. But the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed badly on two shots late in overtime to finish 7 of 21 from the field and gave up an offensive rebound in a one-point game after Jimmy Butler missed two free throws with nine seconds left in the extra period. The Bucks will take an 18-game winning streak into Monday\u2019s game. Dallas then plays Boston at home before trips to Philadelphia and defending NBA champion Toronto. \u201cJust like we did today, the second half,\u201d Hardaway said of the mindset minus Doncic. \u201cBut we have to be like that for the whole 48.

Kelly Oubre\u2019s 3-pointer tied the score at the end of regulation, then Patty Mills topped it with his game-winning jumper with 0.3 seconds left in the extra period to give San Antonio the 121-119 victory. Here\u2019s a look at the most memorable sights and moments from the league\u2019s 30th regular season game in Mexico City. Phoenix was technically the home team, but the crowd threw its support and opposition toward both sides with equal gusto. That meant both teams were drowned in boos and whistles at the free throw line and cheered to the rafters for highlights and game-swinging plays. The game itself fed that fervor, with the Suns storming back in the final two minutes of regulation and the Spurs doing likewise in the final 30 seconds of overtime. Each answering bucket or fatal gaffe drew a response that was postseason worthy, which only bodes well for the city\u2019s own G League team that will debut next season. Latin America appreciates NBA star power. That\u2019s why Michael Jordan jerseys still sell like hotcakes over two decades after his last game with the Chicago Bulls. Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Steve Nash threads were also much in evidence Saturday. There were also a startling amount of underrated throwbacks. Among them: Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, Shaquille O\u2019Neal (Heat edition), Vince Carter (Raptors edition), John Starks, Gary Payton and Kevin Durant (Sonics edition!). With the league\u2019s repeated visits to Mexico, however, there is a visible shift to the present from the country\u2019s basketball fans. There were plenty of recent Suns\/Spurs jerseys in the house, but there were also plenty of 2019-20 versions of Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who was the most loudly cheered Spur) as well. Those jerseys even included the recently released Los Suns versions. Current stars from other teams were also scattered throughout, including Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving and James Harden. With the league having opened the first NBA Store in Mexico earlier this week, it just got easier for the locals to keep up with their current favorites and not just keep treasuring their old ones. American fans in a position to see 41 home games a year are used to the standard slate of in-game activities planned by the home teams. The \u201cmake some noise\u201d graphics, contests and live performances are more or less routine to those used to seeing them. Not so in Mexico, where they get the full NBA experience one week out of the year. The Suns hosted Saturday\u2019s in-game entertainment, and the capacity crowd immersed itself in every part of it. They ooh\u2019d over the Gorilla\u2019s trampoline dunk routine, roared \u201cdefense\u201d in crunch time, and yeah, they made some (additional) noise when called upon. The most underrated part: the spike of vocal anticipation when someone would hoist a 3, which used to happen much more often when 3-pointers were a scarcer part of the NBA game.  Devin Booker\u2019s mid-range shooting stroke is among the best in the league, and that is not an accident. The Michigan native admired Pistons legend Rip Hamilton\u2019s game the most, and patterned his medium and pull-up game after the three-time All-star. Hamilton represented Detroit \u2013 which played in Mexico City on Thursday \u2013 at this week\u2019s events, which ended with him and Booker swapping jerseys during a break in the game. Horacio Llamas set a new standard for the NBA-Mexico when he became his country\u2019s first player to make the league. The arena recognized Llamas\u2019 pioneer role during a timeout by showing his highlights \u2013 which included a slick show-and-go around Hall-of-Famer Hakeem Olajuwon \u2013 before zooming in on the courtside legend himself. Llamas\u2019 countrymen let out a resounding ovation for their first NBA representative, while several of those in his company boasted custom-made, Suns-colored hats that read \u201c El Primero,\u201d which means \u201cThe First.\u201d The Spurs are arguably the most exhausted team in the league after coming off an NBA-record fourth consecutive overtime game. That stretch culminated in a crucial Western Conference win, but the added logistics of playing in a non-traditional city added to what had already been a draining week. So no, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was not about to muse about the gallantry of overcoming all odds and overtimes. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Popovich bluntly observed. Phoenix and San Antonio are two of the most Latin American-influenced cities in the NBA. That meant each team had plenty of support during Saturday\u2019s thriller. The night\u2019s hero, however, hopes there were more Spurs fans leaving Arena Ciudad de M\u00e9xico than when the game began. \u201cSelfishly speaking, we\u2019re not far away in San Antonio, so hopefully we picked up a few more Spurs fans along the way,\u201d Mills said."},{"id":29985,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/james-jr-scores-game-winner-against-fathers-alma-mater","date":"2019-12-15","title":"LeBron's worlds collide as son\u2019s team, alma mater meet","content":" COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 They crowded into Nationwide Arena, 13,000 strong, cheering every shot, roaring with every basket. Many were not there to see the game. They came to see LeBron. Both of them. Bronny James made his Ohio debut Saturday, and hit the go-ahead shot in the Sierra Canyon Trailblazers\u2019 59-56 victory over the St. Vincent-St. Mary Irish. Sierra Canyon is 8-0. Watching, cheering loudest of all and pacing the sideline, was LeBron James, NBA great, father to Bronny, and St. Vincent-St. Mary\u2019s most famous alum. The elder James led the Irish to three state titles in four years, bringing their games to the airwaves of ESPN airwaves and the pages of Sports Illustrated . Now it\u2019s Bronny\u2019s turn. More than 400 credentialed media encircled the court to capture every pass, every dribble, every shot of the King\u2019s firstborn, who would likely have worn an Irish jersey had the family not moved west so James could shine for the Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron James put Akron\u2019s St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School on the map nearly 20 years ago and has donated $2 million to the school, renovating the gymnasium that now bears his name and writing a $250,000 check to buy new uniforms for athletes and band members. His best friend, Willie McGee, is the athletic director. But his heart Saturday was clearly with the Trailblazers, as he yelled tips and encouragement from his court-side seat. With a timeout, James walked halfway on to the court, calling, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go!\u201d to the Sierra Canyon bench and leaping to his feet when the Trailblazers took a first-half lead. \u201cBefore LeBron went to the Lakers, it was assumed Bronny would stay in Ohio and play at St. Vincent -St. Mary, and carry on the tradition,\u201d Zach Fleer of 270 Hoops, central Ohio\u2019s premiere prep basketball site, said. \u201cAmong freshman class, he is among the elite players, but he is not the best player in country. He\u2019s not like his dad yet\u2014he still has a ways to go, Right now I think he is a better shooter than LeBron was at that age. He\u2019s 6-foot-2 now. If he stretches out to his dad size, there is no telling how good he can he.\u201d James took a private plane from Miami to watch his son play high school ball live for the first time, but the game was about more than family by blood. He started the night having dinner with his St. Vincent-St. Mary teammates \u2014 the \u201cFab Five,\u201d they were called when they were the biggest thing in high school basketball 17 years ago. Joining James court-side was his wife, Savannah, childhood friend and business partner Maverick Carter, and former Irish teammate Romeo Travis, who cheered his alma mater but shouted as Bronny James drove down the court, \u201cHere we go young King!\u201d LeBron James has anticipated the sight of his son facing his alma mater for some time. \u201cA pretty surreal, come-full-circle, unbelievable thing,\u201d LeBron James said. James and Dwyane Wade decided months ago that they would have their sons pair up at Sierra Canyon \u2014 just as they did in Miami from 2010 through 2014, winning two championships together with the Miami Heat. Now their kids are chasing a title, although Wade\u2019s son Zaire was injured and did not play Saturday. LeBron James\u2019 said his only regret so far being that his schedule with the Los Angeles Lakers takes him away from Trailblazers\u2019 games. \u201cI love what I do. I don\u2019t take this for granted. This is a dream come true,\u201d LeBron James said. \u201cBut missing my son, missing LeBron Jr., missing (younger son) Bryce\u2019s first game the other day when we left for Orlando, missing my daughter at gymnastics and things of that nature, I understand it\u2019s the business, but it sucks.\u201d Sierra Canyon has been a well-known program in high school circles for some time \u2014 the Trailblazers have won the last two California Open Division state championships and were ranked nationally last year with a roster loaded with blue-chip prospects. Celebrity sightings are an everyday thing at the school where it costs $37,700 a year in tuition alone for high schoolers to attend: Recent Sierra Canyon rosters included the sons of former NBA players Scottie Pippen and Kenyon Martin. Marvin Bagley III played there. Kendall and Kylie Jenner attended the school. Drake has been to games as a fan. This year \u2014 with the oldest sons of James and Wade added to the mix \u2014 it has become a full-on spectacle. Saturday\u2019s game was part of a four-game run that will see them play in four different states, California, Arizona, Ohio and next up will be Nevada in a few days. They\u2019ve played in Texas already. Games in Massachusetts and New Jersey are later this season. ESPN will air 10 more Sierra Canyon games this season, with other games either on television or streamed. Bronny James being compared to his father is inevitable. The attention he draws is also enormous \u2014 videos of his first dunk, when he was 13, have been viewed on YouTube more than 20 million times and he has 3.8 million followers on Instagram. For now, the family is trying to squash any talk of how good a player he can be or if he\u2019ll one day make the NBA. \u201cMy son is in the ninth grade; he\u2019s a kid,\u201d LeBron James said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even thinking about anything besides how he can be a great teammate, how he can be a great son, how he can be a great brother to his sister and little brother, how he can continue to be a great kid.\u201d * * * AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami contributed to this report."},{"id":29958,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bledsoe-expected-miss-two-weeks-fibula-fracture","date":"2019-12-15","title":"Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe to miss at least 2 weeks with fractured fibula","content":" Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe is expected to miss at least two weeks with a fractured right fibula suffered in Friday\u2019s 127-114 victory over the Grizzlies. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bucks\/status\/1206066560345018368 Bledsoe is averaging 15 points, 4.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists this season.

Yes and no. No postseason contest has ever seen the crowd cheer and boo both teams with equal passion. That \u2013 along with an incredible series of back-and-forth plays \u2014 made the final 17 minutes of San Antonio\u2019s 121-119 win over Phoenix a game the locals won\u2019t soon forget. Patty Mills left the lasting impression from Mexico\u2019s first overtime NBA game, draining his game-winning jumper with 0.3 seconds remaining. The sold-out arena exploded when the shot went through \u2013 less than 30 seconds after roaring when Ricky Rubio\u2019s 3-pointer put Phoenix up by two. \u201cFrom the court, I don\u2019t know if you could say there were more Spurs fans than Suns fans,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI think everyone was just fans of the game. That\u2019s how it felt, anyway, but there was a definite energy and atmosphere, especially in the last quarter and in overtime. I think both teams had the opportunity just to feed off it.\u201d They had plenty to chew on in a game during which both teams held double-digit leads before it devolved into a back-and-forth thriller. Phoenix trailed by seven with 2:10 remaining after one of Mills\u2019 six 3-pointers and a pair of ill-timed technical fouls from the bench. Despite missing Devin Booker (right forearm contusion), the Suns rallied until Kelly Oubre\u2019s corner 3-pointer sent the game to overtime and the Mexico City crowd into a frenzy. The lead changed hands four times in overtime alone, with each basket being cheered and each free-throw attempt being booed. The Latin cacophony of whistles worked \u2013 both teams shot in the low 70-percentile, which would represent a bottom-five mark in the league. Phoenix appeared to have the game in hand after Rubio\u2019s 3-pointer and a rare interior miss by LaMarcus Aldridge. Rubio was unable to corral rookie Cam Johnson\u2019s inbounds pass, however, giving the ball back to San Antonio with 8.6 seconds remaining. That was when San Antonio\u2019s Australian trumped Phoenix\u2019s Spaniard to steal the game. Suns coach Monty Williams was direct when addressing his team\u2019s errors late in regulation and overtime. \u201cHow many times did we foul and give up an and-one?\u201d Williams lamented. \u201cHow many times did we foul 3-point shooters? We get two technical fouls in a dead-ball situation. Those last nine seconds, that\u2019s a lesson for all of us. The growing pains have already been plenty for a Phoenix team that is playing its first competitive basketball in half a decade. Former No. 1 Deandre Ayton will return from a 25-game suspension on Wednesday, while several other key players have dealt with injuries. Williams brought none of those obstacles up after Saturday\u2019s thrilling, yet disappointing conclusion. \u201cI told our guys we\u2019ve got to grow up,\u201d Williams said. The Spurs are also struggling in the standings, but have leaned on their experience to endure an unprecedented stretch of extra basketball. Saturday marked their fourth consecutive overtime game, the longest stretch of overtime games by any team NBA history. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is hardly inspired by the achievement. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Popovich deadpanned. Perhaps for the Spurs, but the onlookers in Arena Ciudad de M\u00e9xico felt exactly the opposite. The crowd of more than 20,000 fans was peppered with jerseys of DeMar DeRozan and Devin Booker, along with several other current and former players from two of the NBA\u2019s most Latin American-influenced cities. They made themselves heard almost without pause over the game\u2019s final stages, which served as a punctation point for the league\u2019s 30th regular season game in Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s good to leave a lasting memory for the fans here in Mexico with an overtime game,\u201d Mills said. \u201cFor us, obviously with a win, but I think it\u2019s a win all around and hopefully this can keep growing.\u201d"},{"id":29984,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/griffin-leaves-vs-rockets-sore-left-knee","date":"2019-12-15","title":"Blake Griffin leaves game vs. Rockets with sore left knee","content":"Pistons forward Blake Griffin was held out at halftime of Saturday\u2019s 115-107 road victory against the Rockets with a sore left knee and did not return.

Everything about the two teams seemed to clash for reasons that fans could easily identify. Big men vs. point guards. Execution vs. entertainment. Black-and-silver vs. purple-and-orange. Big-tme performances and heated moments blurred together across 47 total postseason games between them. That span ended, however, with a rare instance of on-court enemies standing together. In 2010, Arizona had recently passed a law that came under scrutiny for potentially violating the basic rights of the state\u2019s sizable Latin American community . Suns owner Robert Sarver issued a public statement condemning the law, and Phoenix players donned their \u201cLos Suns\u201d jerseys \u2013 usually only worn on Latin Pride nights planned well in advance by the league \u2013 in support of those whom they felt the law targeted. This then-rare public showing was even more pronounced given that it was being made during the playoffs \u2013 on May 5, or Cinco de Mayo. The Spurs \u2014 otherwise Phoenix\u2019s rival \u2014 vocally stood by the Suns, as they were unable to obtain their own \u201cLos Spurs\u201d jerseys in time for the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d Popovich said at the time, \u201cbecause it kind of shows what we all should be about.\u201d That moment 10 seasons ago strengthened the teams\u2019 ties to the country that lies directly south of them, which now hosts the NBA\u2019s 30th regular-season game within its borders.  When the Spurs last played in Mexico City, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard were all on the team. San Antonio boasted a 31-8 record at the time, extending a seemingly never-ending window of title contention. That was less than three years ago. Only coach Gregg Popovich remains, along with now-assistant coach Tim Duncan. The former entered the team\u2019s hotel on Friday at the head of a Spurs team that, nearly two months into the season, is still a jarring discovery in the standings. At just 9-15, they\u2019ve already lost precious ground in the Western Conference playoff race, though a midseason turnaround could see them rise quickly in a muddled bottom half of the conference. Minutes after arriving in Mexico City for this week\u2019s south-of-the-border tilt against Phoenix ( 5 ET, League Pass ) , one Latin American reporter asked Popovich to compare this startlingly different season to the two decades of top-tier basketball that preceded it. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing very well,\u201d Popovich wryly observed. That didn\u2019t stop Popovich from planning Saturday morning visits to local museums of art and culture in Mexico City. The Latin American culture is so ingrained in his home city that he admits \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel a whole lot different\u201d being in the heart of Mexico. Yet Popovich thoroughly enjoys taking in the source of that culture, one that defines so much of his franchise\u2019s community. \u201cThe culture that we have in San Antonio is very similar [to here],\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThat culture is something that has been close to all of our players, our management, our owners for a long time.\u201d  Even as San Antonio struggles with its new basketball identity, the Suns have finally discovered one of their own. The departure of Amar\u2019e Stoudemire in 2010 and Steve Nash in 2012 \u2014 and the series of moves that followed \u2013 was harsh. They have not made the playoffs since sweeping these same Spurs in 2010. Monty Williams is the team\u2019s seventh head coach since then, tasked with overseeing what could be the most encouraging Suns team in years. Devin Booker lies at the core of Phoenix\u2019s newfound optimism. The 23-year-old averages 25.0 points and is the only player in the league currently shooting better than 50 percent overall, 40 percent from 3 and 90 percent from the free-throw line. Kelly Oubre, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson provide further potential after several top draft picks failed to pan out. Veteran additions Ricky Rubio, Aron Baynes and Dario Saric have guided the otherwise young Suns in making the transition from cluelessness to competence. Despite injuries to several players and a 25-game suspension to former No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton, Phoenix has hovered around .500 all season, a drastic improvement compared to most of this nearly concluded decade. \u201cThe season is long and this isn\u2019t a thing of 20 games,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re not content with just doing better than last year. We want to do the best we can this year.\u201d In our community we have a lot of Mexican heritage. Being a part of this organization, mixed with my heritage that I\u2019m trying to become more a part of has been unbelievable. Devin Booker Booker has more reason to accomplish that than anyone else on the team. The former No. 13 overall pick is now in his fifth season and has yet to taste 25 wins in any one of them, let alone a playoff game. Less than halfway through December, Phoenix is already hunting for win No. 12. That could come in Mexico, which holds a special significance for Booker. His maternal grandfather was born in Nogales, which lies fewer than 200 miles south of his NBA city. Between his family and his fans, Booker has more reasons than most to forge a connection with Mexico and Latin America. He has staged events in partnership with Nike and Zucaritas (the Hispanic brand of Frosted Flakes), which he called some of the best partnerships he\u2019s enjoyed thus far. On Friday, he and the Suns participated with children in an NBA Cares clinic two days after the Detroit Pistons did the same. \u201cIn our community we have a lot of Mexican heritage,\u201d Booker said. \u201cBeing a part of this organization, mixed with my heritage that I\u2019m trying to become more a part of has been unbelievable.\u201d The Spurs and Suns represent two of the NBA\u2019s strongest links to Mexico and Latin America at large. Per the 2010 US Census , more than 40 percent of Phoenix\u2019s population are of Hispanic or Latino origin. That number jumps above 60 percent in San Antonio. Geographically, they rank as two of the country\u2019s closest NBA neighbors. That link will be strengthened in the coming years. Mexico City\u2019s incoming G League Team will compete against the Suns and Spurs\u2019 own affiliates. NBA academies and clinics will further infuse basketball into a country that has produced four NBA players in the last 22 years. Horacio Llamas became the first of those Mexican pioneers when he signed with the Suns in 1997. \u201cSports in general is the main tool to battle all the negative stuff,\u201d Llamas said. \u201cTo be a part of the Suns organization and the NBA and see them doing so much for the Latin community, I feel so proud.\u201d"},{"id":30037,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-lakers-make-history-20-games-over-500","date":"2019-12-14","title":"Bucks, Lakers make history with both reaching 20 games over .500","content":"Giannis Antetokounmpo returned to action Friday after a one-game absence, scoring 37 to lead the Bucks past the Grizzlies for their 17th straight win.

Horford sat out the Sixers\u2019 115-109 win against the Boston Celtics last night with the same injury . However, Sixers All-Star center Joel Embiid will play against New Orleans.

He received a standing ovation when he was shown on the scoreboard, and he acknowledged the crowd with a wave. The Sixers, 19-7, have won four in a row and eight of their last 10 games.

The Heat veteran is the last voice the starters hear before taking the floor for the opening tip at AmericanAirlines Arena. He dispenses with the pleasantries and speaks in a tone that resonates with these men he spends days on end toiling with for these precious moments. It\u2019s a tradition that began long before any of them wore Heat jerseys, back when Haslem \u2014 a 17-year veteran, team leader and cover boy of the 2019-20 Heat media guide (along with All-Star Jimmy Butler) \u2014 was just happy to make a space for himself with his hometown team. \u201cWe all we got, we all we need and nobody better than us!\u201d Haslem shouts into the huddle of giants.  \u201cIt\u2019s always the last thing I say,\u201d Haslem said later. \u201cBefore that it\u2019s a lot of other stuff. But I always end it with that. And I truly believe that. The only thing that matters is the people in this organization overall, and more importantly the people in this locker room who put the hard hat on every day and collaborate for this common goal.\u201d Don\u2019t let all tropical eye candy and scenery fool you. The Heat have established a blue-collar franchise culture \u2013 one personified in the universally respected Haslem \u2014 in what is a veritable paradise. Miami and South Florida possess all the glitz, glamour and flash of the NBA\u2019s biggest markets. Nestled comfortably into the fabric of daily life here is a Heat franchise with a no-nonsense culture that has spawned decades of success (five NBA Finals and three championships since 2005-06). Blame it on \u2014 or better yet, credit it to \u2014 Pat Riley, the Heat president and former \u201cShowtime Lakers\u201d leader with the supercool South Beach appearance that has always cloaked his hard-scrabble Schenectady, N.Y. sensibilities. The Heat do things the way Riley insists, no matter whose name stretches across the back of the jerseys. It\u2019s a culture that has flourished, floundered and refurbished itself, as it has this season. While other teams have swung for the free-agent fences and chased the quick-fix in the years since \u201cThe Heatles\u201d run of success ended in 2014 , Riley and the Heat continue to do things their way. They\u2019ve mined every avenue for prospects they could develop. They\u2019ve doubled down on players they\u2019ve incubated. And they\u2019ve bet on their way of doing business \u2014 from scouting and drafting to player development and beyond \u2014 as the path back to contender status. If what we\u2019ve seen from them thus far is any indication, they\u2019re well on their way. The Heat are stocked with homegrown young talent, have their anchor star (Butler) and salary cap flexibility on the horizon for what could be a loaded free-agent summer of 2021. The Heat\u2019s spot near the top of the Eastern Conference playoff chase is as surprising as anything, especially given the expectations this group packed for training camp. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has taken the motliest of crews \u2014 Butler, Bam Adebayo, Meyers Leonard, rookie Tyler Herro , undrafted sharpshooter Duncan Robinson and undrafted rookie surprise Kendrick Nunn \u2014 and turned in the finest home start in franchise history. They\u2019ve done so, too, while veterans Goran Dragic and Justise Winslow have dealt with injuries all season. They are a confident bunch because they\u2019ve laid the groundwork for the 18-6 start few outside Miami saw coming. \u201cObviously they\u2019ve done a good job of scouting and bringing this team together,\u201d Nunn said before he and Robinson combined for 70 points in a 135-121 overtime win against Atlanta on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s about having great players who are a good fit on the court, but we also get along great off the court. I think that\u2019s the big key with this team \u2026 that and we\u2019re just a confident group. Each and every one of us know that the man next to us and next up has put in the work.\u201d The Heat are 11-0 at home as ex-Heat star LeBron James and the Lakers visit Friday ( 7 ET, ESPN ). Back in 2010-11, that first James-Dwyane Wade-and-Chris Bosh team got off to a rocky 9-8 start , riling up the skeptics and frightening the locals who were still floating from their superstar summer bounty. Spoelstra has been here since 2008-09 and knows that focusing on the how and why only complicates the already complex team-building equation. Every team, every season is different. Sometimes there\u2019s no easy explanation for why one team comes together when it does. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe just have to keep on plugging away and trying to get better. That\u2019s what these last couple of days have been about. We\u2019re not where we want to be. But some of these things \u2026 you just get a competitive group that wants to dig into the process. And sometimes, you know, you can create special things.\u201d The Heat trust each other. It shines through in how they play and how they refuse to point fingers when things get tight. They seem to always make the right play in the most critical moments, whether it works out or not. And most of the time, it has worked. Need proof? The Heat have outscored their opponents by 30.2 points per 100 possessions in 33 clutch minutes, which ranks No. 1 in the NBA . \u201cI think that\u2019s just team basketball and we believe in each other equally,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not anybody forcing anything. That\u2019s how it\u2019s got to be. You can\u2019t have a one-trick pony at the end of games. We\u2019ve got multiple guys that can make shots and are capable of putting the ball in the basket.\u201d  The trust Butler has in his teammates speaks to his own growth from his younger days. Back then, his competitive fire and refusal to accept anything but the best from himself (and those around him) resulted in nasty breakups in Chicago and Minnesota . Whatever leadership mantle he desired then was instantly thrust upon him when he bypassed last summer\u2019s free-agent frenzy and landed with the Heat via a sign-and-trade deal with the Sixers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to fall in line around here in terms of what we\u2019re about and who we are as a team and an organization,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cAnd for Jimmy, it\u2019s natural, because we\u2019re like him and he\u2019s like us. A bunch of guys with chips on their shoulders, a little edgy and we want to win, so we all relate.\u201d Butler\u2019s unsolicited praise for grinders like Adebayo and Robinson and for rookies Herro and Nunn speaks to a buy-in from the team\u2019s best player that can spur on an impressionable locker room. Butler loves the work, delights in the details that come with every season and relishes similar traits in his teammates. They are gym rats, just like their leader. Long after Herro\u2019s late-game heroics against the Bulls (he scored 16 of the Heat\u2019s final 18 points in an overtime win) and after Herro left the locker room looking every bit the 19-year-old rookie, Butler gushed about the sweat equity and bond he\u2019s built with Herro since the day they first met. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot in common to tell you the truth,\u201d Butler said of Herro. \u201cBut more than anything, I just respect the way that he works and the way that he carries himself. I tell people all the time my two favorite basketball players are Tyler \u2014 because I see the way he works all the time and I love his game and the way that he plays \u2014 and Tre Jones [when he was] at Duke. So when it comes to guys I\u2019d pay to watch, those two are the top ones.\u201d But Butler said it wasn\u2019t an interaction with Herro that caught his attention. \u201cIt\u2019s not when I met him, it\u2019s what everybody else had said about him,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWhen you constantly have people in this organization talking about how he works and he\u2019s gonna be good, [that he\u2019s] a tough son of a gun. You know, I\u2019m like \u2018Okay, let\u2019s see it.\u2019 \u201cAnd then when we meet, he is that. And he\u2019s like, \u2018let\u2019s get in the gym, let\u2019s get in the gym, let\u2019s get in the gym.\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2018I\u2019m with it.\u2019 You never hear me complain about working. And ever since then, I\u2019m happy for him, I\u2019m proud of him and I want him to be the best player he can possibly be. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough to win. That\u2019s all it takes, man. Coach Spo thinks we can win each and every game, which we can. We have to continue to play like that and have that mindset. And not worry about the rest.\u201d Even though he\u2019s the East\u2019s reigning Player of the Week and has seemingly validated his offseason choice to move to Miami, Butler wants no premature celebrations about 2019-20. \u201cI don\u2019t care about none of that, I really don\u2019t,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWhatever the organization and my teammates want me to do, I\u2019m doing it. Whether I have the ball or whatever. As long as we win, man, that\u2019s what I\u2019m locked in on \u2026 yeah, Player of the Week or whatever, that\u2019s cool. But it really doesn\u2019t mean nothing to me.\u201d  The Heat\u2019s formula, however, isn\u2019t fool-proof. Like any other franchise, they\u2019ve made their share of mistakes over the years, both in player evaluation and selection. Back-to-back playoff seasons haven\u2019t happened since those \u201cHeatles\u201d days. There\u2019s $26 million worth of veteran firepower not even in the rotation right now in Dion Waiters and James Johnson. Both are trying to get back into the mix after running afoul of the culture. (The Heat recently hit Waiters with a six-game suspension .) But with every problem they\u2019ve faced, they\u2019ve stuck to their principles in solving them. And they\u2019ve stuck with Spoelstra in an era where coaches come and go at an owner\u2019s whim. They gave center Hassan Whiteside a $96 million max extension in 2016 , betting on him at the expense of taking care of Wade near the end of his storied career .. and Wade walked in free agency to Chicago . But Riley mended fences with the franchise\u2019s most iconic player and traded for him in 2018 . Wade finished his career in a Heat uniform while Whiteside was dealt to Portland in the Butler deal. For all the good vibrations that came with the Wade farewell tour last season , the Heat finished 39-43 and missed the playoffs. Miami\u2019s offseason became huge as it tried to close one chapter and begin another with Butler in place as the star. A solid start serves as validation for Butler choosing Miami as much as it does the Heat betting on him and themselves as the right fit for a star with other options. It might not compare to that summer of 2010 , but it brings more long-term sustainability than \u201cThe Heatles\u201d union provided. Butler is in the prime of his career with Adebayo, Herro and Nunn just scratching the surface of theirs. The possibilities are endless. The future, as Haslem insists, is as bright as the morning Miami sun. Miami is still a destination city and franchise for folks who believe in doing it their own way, as Butler has witnessed in the Heat grooming youngsters like Herro. \u201cI think this organization has a way of raising of players and finding those diamonds in the rough. They are absolutely incredible at that,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAnd they are turning this kid into a real player. Everybody knows he has the talent and he has that mental edge over a lot of young guys. But teaching him how to work every day \u2026 this organization is perfect for him.\u201d Players like Herro, Nunn, Robinson, Adebayo and many more are the ones helping lead this Heat renaissance. \u201cWe are who we are, man.\u201d said Haslem, who has played in just two games this season. \u201cWe are who we are. And we don\u2019t shy away from who we are and what we are. And we understand that it might not be for everybody, but we are who we are. And we\u2019re going to take the hard road and we don\u2019t want anything easy and we\u2019re going to put the work in. We\u2019re going to rely on our foundation, our fundamentals and our culture and we\u2019re going to push through.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

We are 30% through the 2019-20 NBA season. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 8 weekend. Russell Westbrook\u2019s jump shot remains broken. On shots from outside the paint this season, Westbrook has a field goal percentage of 29.4% and an effective field goal percentage of 35.3%. Both are the lowest marks of his career and, among 144 players who have taken at least 100 shots from outside the paint (not including shots from the backcourt), they rank 140th and *143rd. While the Rockets have the league\u2019s third-ranked offense , they\u2019ve scored 11.7 more points per 100 possessions with Westbrook off the floor (120.0) than they have with him on the floor (108.3). In 346 minutes with James Harden on the floor without Westbrook, they\u2019ve scored 121.0 per 100 . With Westbrook off the floor, the Rockets can obviously have a better 3-point shooter for Harden to pass to. Four of their other perimeter players \u2014 Eric Gordon, Ben McLemore, Austin Rivers and Thabo Sefolosha \u2014 have shot worse than the league average (35.6%) from 3-point range, but they\u2019ve all been better than Westbrook (23.0%). Still, when you look at the numbers of other players in the minutes that Harden has been on the floor with and without Westbrook, what stands out is the 3-point shooting of Danuel House and P.J. Tucker . With both Harden and Westbrook on the floor, those two have combined to shoot 46-for-127 (36%) from 3-point range. With only Harden on the floor, House and Tucker have combined to shoot 30-for-54 (56%) from beyond the arc. Maybe Westbrook\u2019s presence hurts the Rockets\u2019 spacing and makes the others\u2019 shots more contested, but probably not to the tune of 20 percentage points. So we can expect a reduction in that on-off differential going forward. Westbrook doesn\u2019t necessarily have to shoot from the outside to take advantage of the extra attention that opposing defenses have been paying to James Harden of late. A defense that doubles or bends toward Harden will have seams which Westbrook can attack. And on a couple of late possessions against Sacramento on Monday, that\u2019s exactly what he did. Westbrook isn\u2019t the best finisher at the rim, either. Only once in his career (last season) has he shot better than the league average in the restricted area. But his shots in the paint (at 55% this season) have been a lot more valuable than his shots from outside (1.10 vs. 0.71 points per attempt). Over the last four games, Westbrook has taken 57% of his shots in the paint, up from 48% through his first 18 games. He\u2019s obviously aware of how poorly he has shot from the outside, and maybe he\u2019s making a conscious effort to get to the basket more. Westbrook has yet to play in both games of a back-to-back and will likely miss one of the Rockets\u2019 two games this weekend . They\u2019re in Orlando Friday night ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and home against the Pistons on Saturday ( 9 ET, League Pass ). The Magic rank 4th in the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from the restricted area (29.5%), while the Pistons rank 24th (35.0%), so having Westbrook sit the first game might be the better play. Devonte\u2019 Graham did it again. For the second time this season, the 6-foot-1 guard came up big in the closing seconds of a Hornets win in New York. At Madison Square Garden last month, Graham hit a game-winning 3 with 2.1 seconds left to beat the Knicks. And at Barclays Center on Wednesday, the second-year guard drained two jumpers to turn a tie game into a five-point win. The first of those two tied Graham for the league lead in buckets to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. He already has as many 3-pointers to tie or take the lead in the final minute (he\u2019s 2-for-4) as Kemba Walker had over his last two seasons with the Hornets (2-for-18). As a whole, the league has shot 97-for-270 (35.9%), including 43-for-131 (32.8%) on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute. Amazingly, though he\u2019s played in just 11 of the Nets\u2019 24 games, Kyrie Irving (1-for-7) is tied with teammate Dinwiddie and Jimmy Butler (1-for-7) for the second most attempts to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth or OT. Seventeen of the Nets\u2019 24 games (and 10 of their 13 wins) have been within five points in the last five minutes and 12 of those 17 (and six of their wins) have been within three points in the final minute of the fourth quarter. The Hornets are 11-16, hanging around in the East playoff race because of their success in close games. Nine of their 11 wins have been within three points in the final minute of the fourth quarter. Their 11 wins have come by an average of 4.6 points , and they already have as many wins by five points or fewer ( seven ) as they had last season . Their 16 losses, meanwhile, have come by an average of 14.4 points. More opportunities for drama await. The Hornets play twice this weekend , visiting the Bulls on Friday ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and the Pacers on Sunday ( 5 ET, League Pass ). If you believe that second-year players can win the Kia Most Improved Award, then Graham might be your leading candidate. After his 40-point performance in Brooklyn on Wednesday, he\u2019s averaging 20.0 points and 7.6 assists per game, up from just 4.7 and 2.6 last season . Part of that is a huge increase in minutes (from 14.7 to 33.8), but Graham has also seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in usage rate among players who played at least 500 minutes last season and have played at least 250 minutes this season. Here are the top 12 in that regard, with Graham neither the only second-year player nor the only Hornet on the list \u2026  Along with jump in usage rate, Graham has been more efficient. Among 212 players that attempted at least 200 shots last season and have attempted at least 100 this season, he\u2019s seen the second biggest jump in true shooting percentage. Here are the top 12 \u2026 Dennis Schroder is a little further down both of the above lists, with a jump in usage rate from 23.8% to 26.0% and a jump in true shooting percentage from 50.8% last season to 54.6% . To the eyes, Schroder seems to be playing a little bit slower in his second season in Oklahoma City. And player tracking data from Second Spectrum matches what the eyes have seen. This season, Schroder has averaged 4.34 miles per hour on offense , down from 4.54 last season and 4.87 the season prior . Playing slower and more in control seems to be working for Schroder. Both his field goal percentage in the pant (52.7%) and his effective field goal percentage on shots outside the paint (50.8%) are career-high marks. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Bucks take top billing (again) If you\u2019ve been out of the mix for the last month or so, here\u2019s a quick catch-up: Milwaukee is really, really good this season. The Bucks are going for their 17th straight win tonight as they visit the Grizzlies ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and, if they can do that, would be the first team since the 2017-18 Rockets to win 17 straight games. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed Milwaukee\u2019s last game because of right quad soreness and is questionable tonight . He has a streak of nine consecutive games with 25 or more points while shooting 50% or better working right now. 2. LeBron heads back to Miami This looming Lakers-Heat showdown ( 7 ET, ESPN ) should be a classic. Pick a storyline and we\u2019ve got you covered. Big win streak on the line? Yep, as the Lakers have won 12 straight on the road (and five in a row overall). Superstar showdown? Of course, with LeBron James taking on the Heat\u2019s Jimmy Butler in a matchup of two top contenders in each conference. Other exciting names to watch? Try the Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis and the Heat\u2019s rookie duo of Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro . This should be the game of the night, so don\u2019t miss it. 3. The Harden (road) Show continues Who says playing away from the friendly confines is tough? Certainly not Rockets star James Harden, who is fresh off a 55-point game in Cleveland and ready for tonight\u2019s game in Orlando ( 7 ET, League Pass ). The Kia MVP candidate is averaging 40.8 ppg on the road this season, which is a significant jump from his 36.5 ppg at home in 2019-20. Only once in his career ( the 2013-14 season ) has Harden ever averaged more ppg on the road than at home (and that year, the difference was hardly noticeable). Worth watching to see how he fares against a somewhat stout Magic defense tonight. 4. Embiid looking invigorated Nothing like some real talk from a pair of Hall of Famers to snap you out of your funk. That did the trick for Sixers center Joel Embiid, who took some recent talk from Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Charles Barkley to heart and then took his frustrations out on the Celtics last night . Philadelphia is riding a four-game win streak as it hosts skidding New Orleans ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and it will be worth watching to see if Embiid stays as motivated against a clearly lesser foe. 5. Wolves face critical stretch After starting the season 4-2, Minnesota has gone 6-12 the rest of the way and has lost its last six games. A date with the Clippers ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) seems like a daunting challenge given LA\u2019s top-notch defense and the Paul George-Kawhi Leonard combo. Minnesota can\u2019t use that as an excuse, though, and a win tonight might get things rolling as five of its next six games after tonight are against fellow sub-.500 teams. But further spiraling would put the Wolves in the Blazers-Spurs-Grizzlies portion of the West that seems to be fading fast. 6. Remembering a historic scoring game This season, 14 teams are averaging 110 ppg or more and three teams have scored 150 or more in a game at least once. Yet no one \u2014 this season or before it \u2014 has approached the offensive total the Pistons and Nuggets put up on Dec. 13, 1983 . The Pistons won the historic game in triple-overtime 186-184 as Isiah Thomas led the way for Detroit with 47 points, 17 assists, five rebounds and four steals."},{"id":30035,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-dec-13-edition-2019-20","date":"2019-12-13","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Luka Doncic follows own 'rhythm' in NBA rise","content":"Goran Dragic tried to warn us. When he and Luka Doncic were leading Slovenia to the title at EuroBasket 2017 , the Miami Heat point guard was singing the praises of his teenage teammate who was still playing for Real Madrid. Dragic swore that Doncic would do the same things he\u2019d done on the world stage in the NBA. \u201cHe\u2019s a born winner. No, I\u2019m not kidding, he already has a lot of trophies, and medals,\u201d Dragic said after Slovenia knocked off Serbia in the title game. \u201cI\u2019m happy for him. Mark my words, he\u2019s going to be one of the best in the whole world.\u201d Fast-forward to this season and Doncic is doing exactly what Dragic said he would. As proof, he\u2019s No. 2 in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. But even Dragic has to admit he\u2019s been a little surprised at how quickly Doncic has dominated in the NBA. \u201cI know what I said before and I meant it,\u201d Dragic said after a Miami Heat shootaround this week. \u201cThe only thing that surprises me is that it\u2019s so quick. I was thinking third, fourth, fifth year [in the NBA]. But not in his second year.

I\u2019ve known him since he was five years old, he was a ball boy for our team. So it\u2019s amazing to see his growth from a young kid until now. I mean, he\u2019s still young, but \u2026 he doesn\u2019t play like it.\u201d To Dragic, seeing Doncic dominate the NBA in his own way is enjoyable \u2014 mostly because Doncic is silencing the skeptics who didn\u2019t believe his game would translate. \u201cI told somebody that even when we played for the national team, he plays at his own pace. Nobody can speed him up, and nobody can make him feel uncomfortable,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cHe\u2019s always in a rhythm and he just knows how to use his body and his strength.

Seconds before commissioner Adam Silver delivered the news personally to a room packed with mostly Latin American media, Twitter began trickling the word: Mexico City was getting its own NBA G League team . When Silver confirmed the groundbreaking endeavor \u2013 which will be owned and operated by professional Mexican club Capitanes \u2013 excited murmurs rippled through the room. Over the last four years, those same media outlets had diligently and repeatedly asked Silver about the league\u2019s future intentions within its southern neighbor\u2019s borders. The most oft-asked question: is an NBA team coming and, if so, when? The question behind the question was clear. What were all the regular season games, clinics and youth academies from the last few years building towards? Silver\u2019s answer was emphatic. \u201cI think it\u2019s an important signal to the market just how important we view the entire country of Mexico and all of Latin America,\u201d Silver said. Roughly 24 hours before the G League announcement, Mexico\u2019s NBA godfather looked on as his country\u2019s basketball future spent time with the Detroit Pistons. Teenagers from NBA Academy Latin America took pictures with and played one-on-one against a few of the players, brushing the dream that Horacio Llamas lived over two decades ago. \u201cIt\u2019s very special for them to see the platform in front of their eyes, things that we didn\u2019t have when we were their age,\u201d Llamas said. \u201cTo have tools, coaches to help them get closer to their goal\u2026 most of them don\u2019t come from a big city or economic wealth. They come together with people they don\u2019t know, with languages they don\u2019t speak and they become a family that work hard every day. They\u2019re hoping at least to get a scholarship in the states. That\u2019s the next step to get ready when any NBA team or camp gives you the opportunity.\u201d Llamas cashed in on that opportunity when he signed with the Phoenix Suns in 1997 as an undrafted free agent out of Grand Canyon University, making him the NBA\u2019s first Mexican-born player. The 6-foot-11 center was an instant fan favorite in a city with an overwhelming Latin American influence. A pair of his NBA shorts are on display in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame. Llamas\u2019 career was short \u2013 just 28 games \u2013 but it further opened a door that had only allowed preseason games to that point. This week\u2019s games mark the 29th and 30th regular season contests played in Mexico since then \u2013 the most other than the United States and Canada. Yet Llamas, Silver and several key figures from both sides want to strengthen Mexico\u2019s ability to produce, and not just receive, NBA talent. As revolutionary as the G League announcement is, they recognize the native talent must be recognized and treasured long before the professional playing age. \u201cWe are looking for talent, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said NBA Mexico VP and Managing Director Raul Zarraga. \u201cThis G League team is part of this basketball ecosystem that we are building around the nation. Now we are creating an alternative for them so in the future they can see themselves living basketball and perhaps playing in the NBA.\u201d Mexico\u2019s current youth has admirable predecessors to emulate. Eduardo Najera followed Llamas from Mexico to the NBA and carved out a 12-year career as an all-out hustle player and fan favorite. Gustavo Ayon and Jorge Gutierreze are the country\u2019s most recent NBA exports. Now the league stands waiting and ready for Mexico\u2019s next wave of talent. Luka Doncic and Ricky Rubio represent the most recognizable Spanish-speaking NBA players in Mexico City this week. They also hail from countries that were not always synonymous with basketball, but that have recently become international powerhouses. Doncic helped lead Slovenia to an unexpected 2017 Eurobasket Gold Medal. Rubio\u2019s Spanish national teams boast two Eurobasket golds, two Olympic medals and the 2019 FIBA World Cup gold medal. This begets the question: if Slovenia (a country with just one million people) and Spain (overwhelmingly inclined to soccer) can produce golden eras of basketball, why not Mexico? \u201cWhat is our dream? To bring another Mexican to the NBA, of course, very soon,\u201d decalred Capitanes co-owner Gilberto Hernandez. NBA Academy Latin America will play a vital role in generating that movement. The basketball training program, backed by the NBA and the Mexican government, develops talent from the Caribbean, Mexico, Central American and South America. The academy projects to be a destination for top-tier young prospects, similar to many such institutions in Europe that helped develop Doncic and other European talents that moved on to the NBA. \u201cThis is the next step in this market,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe\u2019re learning we need to be on the ground, we need to be local, we need to get basketballs in the hands of young boys and girls. We need to work particularly with the elite players.\u201d Doncic understands the power of a relatable example. He and fellow countryman Goran Dragic were weaned on stories of former Yugoslavia\u2019s superstars, including Vlade Divac and Drazen Petrovic. The 20-year-old Doncic \u2013 who is fluent in Spanish after playing professionally in Spain \u2013 took the microphone immediately before tipoff on Thursday and greeted the crowd. \u201cHola, como estas?\u201d (Hi, how are you guys?) The building erupted. Somewhere amid the cheering throng, Doncic, Mexico and the NBA hope at least one youth is inspired to pick up a basketball and take the country\u2019s next step in their rapidly expanding basketball world. \u201cI hope I inspire kids here and everywhere to play basketball and have fun,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThe sport has done a lot for me and my country, and I\u2019m sure it can do the same anywhere.\u201d Starting in 2020-21, the city\u2019s new G League team will provide a much closer glimpse of that goal. Capitanes will bear the added challenge of being an independent team \u2013 they will have no NBA affiliate team directly feeding it draft prospects, summer league standouts or two-way contract players. Instead they will fill out the roster themselves, and hope that the process inspires local talent to make the team and its parent league. \u201cThis is great news for our country,\u201d Hernandez beamed. \u201cThe fact that the NBA, the most global league in the whole world, is putting solid two feet in our country, I believe it\u2019s great news not only for basketball, but for sports nationwide.\u201d"},{"id":29999,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/7-observations-pistons-mavericks-mexico-city","date":"2019-12-13","title":"7 observations from Mavericks-Pistons in Mexico City","content":" MEXICO CITY \u2014 The 2019 NBA Mexico City Games began with a fourth consecutive sellout. A crowd of over 20,000 Latino fans voiced its raucous approval through the Mavericks\u2019 122-111 victory over Detroit, highlighted by Luka Doncic logging the first NBA triple-double in Mexico. Here\u2019s a look at the best moments from Thursday night\u2019s game: Fans were sitting outside the arena four hours before tipoff, many of them wearing jerseys from a multitude of teams and eras. Among them: Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, LeBron James (Lakers and Cavs), Ben Wallace, Kyrie Irving (Celtics), Derrick Rose (Bulls), Doncic, Jamal Mashburn (Mavericks) and many more. When the teams ran out for pregame warmups, they were greeted with postseason-level roars, immediately setting the tone for a highly anticipated night of NBA basketball. 2. Star recognition  Whenever the center-hung scoreboard focused on Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond or Derrick Rose, the reaction was instantaneous. The ovations were even louder during opening introductions and highlight plays. Latino fans are well-versed on the NBA\u2019s star power, and they clearly appreciated the chance to see it up close and in person. 3. Luka, Luka, y m\u00e1s Luka  You could not have scripted a better first impression between player and pa\u00eds . It began before tipoff, with Doncic greeting the crowd in Spanish. \u201c Hola, c\u00f3mo esta\u00eds?\u201d Mexico boomed its approval, which the 20-year-old kept by playing the best individual game the country has ever witnessed. His 41 points were a record by an NBA player in Mexico City. His behind-the-back passes, 3-pointers and dunks rocked the arena. And his final free throws earned him MVP chants that would rival those Doncic might hear in Dallas. \u201cThe fans treated me so well,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThey had fun, and we played a good game for them.\u201d Conclusion: Mexico loves Luka, and they probably will for a long time. When it ventures to neutral sites, the NBA surely hopes the fans will not be disappointed from an entertainment standpoint. Mexico City wasn\u2019t. Aside from the aforementioned Doncic domination, Kristaps Porzingis\u2019 high-flying action on both ends of the floor made him an instant fan favorite. Blake Griffin drew oohs and aahs with a crossover and dunk. Christian Wood opened eyes with a couple slams of his own. Rose continued to remind faithful fans of his prime. Just as impressive as the highlights were the responses to them. Shouts, claps and whistles combined to form a cacophony of NBA enjoyment, perhaps a portent for Mexico\u2019s newly announced G League team (which arrives in 2020-21). \u201cThey treated every play like it was playoff game,\u201d Drummond said afterwards. The first highlight of the night didn\u2019t happen on the court, but in a conference room. Adam Silver, in conjunction with Mexican team Capitanes owners and NBA officials, announced the formation of a G League team in Mexico City. The news was greeted by immediate excitement from the Latin American media, and will surely earn a similar reaction from Mexican sports fans in general. The men delivering the news were just as thrilled, however, embracing one another and smiling over the international milestone being reached in the biggest North American market. \u201cI believe that the years to come will be amazing,\u201d said Capitanes owner Gilberto Hernandez. \u201cWe\u2019re really, really exited. I mean, words can\u2019t describe how I feel right now. Thank you so much. Thank you, Adam, Shareef [Abdur-Rahim].\u201d Every amenity a fan might see in an NBA arena was on display and available in La Arena de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Photo booths, apparel shops, shooting games and much more featured lines well beyond the roped-off markers before, during and after the game. Mexico City\u2019s experience with NBA basketball may be short compared to the U.S. and Canada, but it proved (again) more than capable of housing the entertainment value to go along with the sport itself. Allergic reactions are no joke, and neither were Drummond\u2019s eyes after accidentally consuming avocados shortly after arriving in Mexico City. The two-time All-Star was unable to participate in the team\u2019s two practices, and was a game-time decision before ultimately suiting up. Drummond credited the team medical staff, which helped completely reduce the swelling in his right eye and partially help his left. It was enough, as the Pistons big man finished with 23 points and 15 rebounds. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see for about 48 hours,\u201d Drummond laughed. \u201cThe medical staff did a great job of helping me get ready to play.\u201d"},{"id":29998,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-statement-commissioner-emeritus-david-stern","date":"2019-12-13","title":"Former NBA Commissioner Stern has emergency brain surgery","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA said former Commissioner David Stern suffered a sudden brain hemorrhage Thursday and had emergency surgery.

Playing for the New Orleans Hornets during the 2011-12 season, Ariza watched as a trade that would have sent Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers failed to manifest. \u201cThat situation was a little different than this one, but still that trade didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Ariza said. Like that ill-fated move in December of 2011, this one played out in real time on social media for all the world to see.  Word first started to spread on Dec. 14 through a series of tweets that jumped across the timelines of NBA fans. ESPN reported the Grizzlies had agreed to join a three-way trade between the Suns and Wizards. The Suns would send Ariza to the Wizards. The Wizards would send Austin Rivers to the Suns and Kelly Oubre Jr. to Memphis. But the wheels would quickly fall off due to a misunderstanding among the teams about the player Memphis would need to add to the transaction to meet salary-cap requirements. Phoenix reportedly expected to acquire Dillon Brooks from Memphis, along with Wayne Selden and Washington\u2019s Rivers in the deal. Yet Memphis insisted it never had plans to trade Dillon Brooks. Instead, the Grizzlies wanted to move MarShon Brooks along with Selden. The Grizzlies declined to participate in the trade under any other parameters. So they eventually pulled out of talks, ultimately forcing Washington to deal directly with Phoenix to acquire Ariza in exchange for Rivers and Oubre. As the drama behind the scenes played out, reports would continue to surface on Twitter for what turned out to be one of the most bizarre trades in history to never actually happen. As MarShon Brooks watched from the Memphis bench after playing 16 minutes in the team\u2019s loss against Miami that night, word started to spread. Former Memphis general manager Chris Wallace reportedly told MarShon and Selden after the game they were part of a three-team trade that would bring Wizards wing Oubre to Memphis. \u201cThen, after that conversation, we were told that the trade didn\u2019t go through,\u201d a Grizzlies source said. \u201cSo then, we had to go in and have a second conversation and basically apologize that it happened that way. It\u2019s a tough situation, and you could see it in the guys\u2019 faces.\u201d Wallace didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment, but in the immediate aftermath of the failed trade, he blamed media leaks from the Wizards and Suns for what transpired. A member of the Phoenix Suns\u2019 front office, when contacted, declined comment. Dillon Brooks still cringes when discussing the situation that he says taught him the NBA is \u201ca cutthroat league.\u201d Dillon said he found out about the trade from voices in the crowd at the FedExForum that night. \u201cI was shocked when that came out,\u201d Brooks told NBA.com. \u201cI guess it was the wrong Brooks. We had two Brooks at the time, but they ended up clearing it up. [Wallace] ended up coming to me and saying, \u2018You know, we didn\u2019t trade you. It was the wrong name.\u2019 He was on the phone for about 20 or 30 minutes I guess with Phoenix. But it made things awkward a bit. Luckily, MarShon was a vet and never took it the wrong way. Sometimes you get hard feelings or whatever. But we talked about it, and we both thought it was funny. We both moved on.\u201d Memphis ended up sending MarShon and Selden to the Chicago Bulls along with two future second-round picks for Justin Holiday. The Bulls then waived MarShon on Jan. 7, and he eventually signed with the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association, where he won a championship.  MarShon Brooks\u2019 agent, Wallace Prather, called the situation an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d Having worked as an NBA agent since 2001, Prather once represented a pair of clients \u2014 Donta Smith and Josh Smith in Atlanta \u2014 with the same last names, but he\u2019d never experienced a failed trade like this one. \u201cMemphis, they were talking about MarShon and the other team was talking about Dillon,\u201d Prather said. \u201cNo one actually said \u2018Dillon\u2019 or \u2018MarShon\u2019 in the conversation. So, when it was time to move, Chris Wallace had pulled MarShon to the side to let him know. But I guess at the last minute when they were doing the trade call, they were calling out the names and were like, \u2018Whoa, whoa, not that Brooks.\u2019 They definitely [expletive] up.\u201d While it\u2019s been reported that former Wizards GM Ernie Grunfeld served as the middleman and point of contact in the failed transaction between the teams, current Washington GM Tommy Sheppard disputes that characterization. Grunfeld didn\u2019t respond to a voicemail seeking comment. Sheppard, meanwhile, explained that in three-way deals, usually the teams acquiring players or compensation from one another remain in direct contact, saying, \u201cthe third team rarely talks to the first team.\u201d In this case, Sheppard said that all the teams involved were aware of all the parameters of the proposed deal, but none of the teams \u201cwere running quarterback.\u201d Sheppard would find himself in damage-control mode, too. That night the Wizards were on the road playing the Brooklyn Nets. At the time, Sheppard worked as Washington\u2019s senior vice president of basketball operations, while Grunfeld served as the GM. \u201cI knew we were gonna do something, so I went with the team to tell the players because it\u2019s an absolute travesty for a player to hear [about a trade] from anybody else than his own front office,\u201d Sheppard told NBA.com. \u201cI knew we were gonna make a trade.\u201d Once the proposed three-team deal was reduced to rubble, Sheppard joined the Wizards on the team bus to explain what was happening. But the players already knew about the trade as Washington left the Barclays Center for the airport. Still, Sheppard pulled Oubre and Rivers off the bus to give them the lowdown. \u201cI told them, \u2018Guys, this is [expletive] up. But you will be traded tomorrow, make no mistake,\u2019\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThey got off the bus as it was breaking, everything was falling apart, and it was awkward as [expletive]. The trade fell through. That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be professionals. I said, \u2018Hey guys, this is exactly what happened.\u2019 For Austin, Phoenix was like, \u2018Don\u2019t even come.\u2019 They didn\u2019t want him. It ended up great for him because he got to Houston. \u201cFor Kelly, he found a home in Phoenix, and they actually gave him another contract. For us, we ended up with Ariza\u2019s money coming off, and we moved forward. We had a couple of other teams we were looking at doing stuff [with], but we hit back with Phoenix because Phoenix really just wanted off Ariza. And we said we could do these deals without the Memphis piece. Memphis was involved because they wanted Oubre.\u201d Sheppard said he\u2019ll go to his grave believing it was just an honest mistake, but added that miscommunication regarding two players with the same last name shouldn\u2019t have been the issue. \u201cI know that if there are ever guys with the same last names, common sense says to always refer to them with the first name,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cAnd I know we never, ever, and this isn\u2019t an exoneration at all, I\u2019m just saying that any conversations we had with Memphis, there was never MarShon Brooks\u2019 name not once mentioned.\u201d Regardless, the human element of these transactions always comes into play. The decision-makers are human, thus prone to human error, and that ultimately affects the human lives of the players and their families. \u201cI think MarShon\u2019s friends and family were more upset than I was and more upset than he was,\u201d Prather said. Dillon Brooks pointed to the situation as a lesson that stresses \u201cyou never know what\u2019s going to happen, even if you\u2019re working hard and playing hard.\u201d  J.B. Bickerstaff, Memphis\u2019 coach at the time, declined to comment specifically about that situation but shared insights regarding the human element associated with transactional decisions. \u201cThings like how long guys have been there, the relationship that you have with their families, those types of things always play a part because the decision-makers are human, too,\u201d said Bickerstaff, who is now the associate head coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Memphis terminated Bickerstaff in April and demoted Wallace from GM to scout. The Wizards fired Grunfeld in April, replacing him with Sheppard. \u201cI guess the untold story in that deal, or the given in that deal is the GMs all lost their jobs,\u201d Sheppard said. As for Ariza? \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d he said about the business and being traded. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on families, especially when you have little children and they\u2019re getting moved around like that. \u201cIt is what it is, but it\u2019s what we signed up for.\u201d * * * Michael C.

After missing four games with a sore back, Morant returned Monday with 26 points in a dominant performance in Golden State in which he took over once again down the stretch. The No. 2 pick scored 13 in the fourth quarter, capped off by a crowd-silencing dunk with a minute left to help seal the Grizzlies\u2019 110-102 victory. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trust with the ball in his hands to make the right play,\u201d coach Taylor Jenkins said. \u201cHe had a couple assists late that we needed. Big moments for him, and it\u2019s awesome to see so early in his career.\u201d While Morant returns to the top spot, he didn\u2019t regain it without a serious challenger. Miami\u2019s Kendrick Nunn did his thing in the Heat\u2019s come-from-behind OT win against Atlanta on Tuesday, scoring a career-high 36 points on 14-for-26 shooting (3-for-10 on 3s). He also added six rebounds and four assists to help Miami win its third straight. Nunn continues to be Morant\u2019s most serious threat in the Kia Rookie of the Year race as he\u2019s playing a major role on one of the East\u2019s true contenders. Morant is dazzling and drawing headlines with his highlight-reel drives, but Nunn is quietly leading one of the league\u2019s biggest surprises, helping Miami climb to second in the Eastern Conference. * * * Last week: No. 4 While Morant shined in his return to the court, he admitted afterward he was still thinking about the injury that resulted from him crashing into a cameraman on the baseline. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because I know I just have to do more controlled jumps now,\u201d Morant told Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m just trying not to think about it and still try to play my game. It\u2019s just a tough situation all the way around, honestly.\u201d Morant clearly isn\u2019t too afraid of going strong, though, as he put the finishing touches on the Suns with a monster poster dunk over Aron Baynes that led virtually every highlight reel Wednesday night. Last week: No. 2 Nunn\u2019s 36 points against Atlanta were the most by a rookie this season, topping the 34 Eric Paschall put up Nov. 4 . He also found his way into the record books alongside teammate Duncan Robinson, who had a career night (34 points, 10 3-pointers) vs. Atlanta. The 70 points combined was the most in NBA history by a pair of undrafted teammates. \u201cAll the work you see,\u201d Nunn said, \u201cwe have put all the effort behind closed doors.\u201d Last week: No. 3 Hachimura had another solid week, averaging 19 ppg and 8.0 rpg in four games. His breakout game came in the Wizards\u2019 surprising 119-113 win over the Sixers last Thursday. Hachimura scored 27 points and grabbed seven rebounds. He\u2019s scored in double-digits in seven straight and capped his week off with the second double-double of his career, grabbing 12 rebounds to go with 18 points in Tuesday\u2019s 114-107 loss to the Hornets. Last week: Not ranked Immediately after I bumped Herro from last week\u2019s Ladder (in my defense, he had 15 points in a three-game span), the sharpshooter busted out. Herro scored 22 with seven rebounds in a win over the Wizards, then followed that up with an epic 27-point night in a win over the Bulls. Herro was the Heat\u2019s hero , scoring 16 of Miami\u2019s final 18 to seal the win. Herro hit the game-tying 3 in regulation, then knocked down three more in OT to seal the win and prove just how much his teammates trust him. \u201dIf your max player (Jimmy Butler) trusts you at that point in the game \u2014 and Jimmy was looking for him \u2014 that says all you need to know,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201dThat trust has been earned within our walls. Jimmy has seen what this kid does in those situations.\u201d Of course, Herro had the first scoreless game of his career , missing all six shots (including four 3s) two nights later in 23 minutes of a win over Atlanta. Thus is the life of a teenage rookie. Last week: Not ranked Washington had a solid week, averaging 15.5 points on 43.9% shooting (39.1% on 3-pointers) as Chalotte went 2-2. Washington remains one of the Hornets\u2019 mainstays, earning praise from coach James Borrego after he was able to get to the free-throw line 13 times Sunday , which helped lead to a 20-point outing. \u201cHe\u2019s earning respect out there \u2014 he\u2019s aggressive and putting pressure on officials to make calls,\u201d Borrego said . \u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue to have him more aggressive in (the lane). He has a knack for that. The combination for him \u2014 the 3-point line and the interior \u2014 is a really nice combination.\u201d Matisse Thybulle, Philadelphia 76ers:  Thybulle was big in each of the Sixers\u2019 past two wins, scoring a career-high 20 (5-for-8 from beyond the arc) with three steals in a 110-104 win over the Raptors , then putting up 13 (on 3-for-4 3-point shooting) in Philly\u2019s 97-92 win over Denver . If Thybulle can continue to shoot like this from beyond the arc, he\u2019ll continue to see big minutes. His defense is second to none among rookies. R.J. Barrett, New York Knicks: Barrett has scored in double-digits in two of his last five games, averaging 10 ppg while shooting 30.9% and 29.4% on 3-pointers. He finished the week with a 22-point, 10-rebound game in the Knicks\u2019 OT win over Golden State , but it\u2019s not enough to keep him in the Top 5. DeAndre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks:  Hunter scored a career-high 28 points in Atlanta\u2019s overtime loss to the Heat on Tuesday, going 11-for-17 from the field and hitting five of 10 3s. He followed that up a night later with six points in 24 minutes, but he\u2019s proving he has the ability for breakout games, especially when his 3s are falling. Eric Paschall, Golden State Warriors:  Paschall slips out of the Top 5 as he\u2019s dealing with a hip injury. Paschall has back-to-back five-point games and almost didn\u2019t play Wednesday night. He did end up starting despite being listed as questionable, but played just 16 minutes. The Warriors will likely play it safe with Paschall (31.5 mpg), who is one Golden State\u2019s most reliable players this season. Kevin Porter Jr., Cleveland Cavaliers:  Porter Jr. gets a tip of the hat this week for going toe-to-toe with Houston\u2019s James Harden. The NBA\u2019s leading scorer finished with 55 on Wednesday , but Porter Jr. scored a career-high 24 ( 16 in the 4th ), going 6-for-9 on 3-pointers while not flinching when tasked with guarding Harden. Over his past five games, the No. 30 pick has averaged 12.8 ppg on 53.2% shooting (52.4% on 3-pointers). * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 11 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

Luka was coming. Dallas boasts the most Spanish-speaking NBA players among the four teams in Mexico City this week. Kristaps Porzingis, J.J. Barea and Boban Marjanovic are all fluent in the language. Former Maverick and Mexico native Eduardo N\u00e1jera is still with the team. And Luka was coming. When the pair of dark-tinted buses rolled up, cell phones and cameras were hoisted up. One by one the players exited, each drawing some reaction. But nothing compared to the buzz when Doncic finally set foot on Mexican soil (or sidewalk, in this case). \u201cLuka! Luka!\u201d Some of the media and fans tried to get his attention, but the Slovenian sensation remained deep within his hoodie. It was hard to blame him. The Mavericks had arrived well after their scheduled time, fighting the Mexico City traffic that is even more gummed up as the holidays approach. But this is the life Doncic and the Mavericks, early Western Conference contenders with a 16-7 record, now live wherever they go, other countries included. Because Doncic \u2014 a Slovenian-born, Spanish-speaking NBA standout \u2014 has the kind of star power that already ignores borders and breaks down language barriers. \u201cHe\u2019s a lightning bolt everywhere,\u201d said Mavs coach Rick Carlisle. \u201cThis is not new territory for him or for us. He\u2019s one of the most popular players in the world. He\u2019s one of the best players in the world. He creates a lot of excitement wherever he goes.\u201d Several Mavericks players greeted the media after settling into their hotel rooms. Carlisle, Porzingis and Barea each were swarmed. When it was his turn, Doncic was all but mobbed.  In Spanish that would have made his Real Madrid coaches proud, Doncic answered the questions the Latin American community wanted to ask for themselves. Doncic said Barea\u2019s championship experience has helped him a lot. NBA basketball is very different from EuroLeague. No, he\u2019s not going to indulge in Kia MVP or championship talk in December. It\u2019s only his second year and he hasn\u2019t done anything compared to Michael Jordan . He considers the Lakers, Clippers and Bucks as contenders off the top of his head. His best advice for young basketball hopefuls is work and have fun. The fun is what Doncic hopes Latin American fans take away from this week\u2019s games, starting Thursday night with Dallas going up against the Pistons. If last season\u2019s games are any indication, the 20,000-plus capacity Arena de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico will be sold out. There is no certainty that Dallas will be among the next group of teams selected to play in these games going forward. This is, for now, their only opportunity to see Doncic in person without traveling over 1,100 miles to Dallas. \u201cI hope they enjoy our game when we play tomorrow,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure for us to be here. We\u2019re going to enjoy it, for sure.\u201d One media member asked him what he would enjoy most. \u201cPlaying basketball.\u201d Could you be more specific? \u201cPlaying basketball,\u201d he repeated with a smile. Odds are Latin America will enjoy it, too."},{"id":30050,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/things-know-nba-dec-12","date":"2019-12-12","title":"3 NBA things to know for Dec. 12","content":" 1. What\u2019s the word on Hayward? The Celtics host the Sixers tonight ( 8 ET, TNT ) in a showdown between two Eastern Conference contenders. Two games after getting back in the mix for Boston following a one-month layoff, Gordon Hayward\u2019s status could be in doubt tonight. He took a shot to the nose in the fourth quarter of last night\u2019s 122-117 loss to the Pacers . Hayward went back to the locker room after that and missed the rest of the game, but told Celtics.com he is hopeful he\u2019ll play against Philadelphia. This game is also Al Horford\u2019s first one back in Boston, but he is questionable for it because of left knee soreness and left hamstring pain. 2. Mexico City gets a taste of Luka-mania For the fourth straight season, the NBA is back in Mexico for some regular-season games. Adding a bit more excitement to these games is the play of Kia MVP contender Luka Doncic as his Mavs take on the Pistons ( 9 ET, League Pass ). He is in the midst of a 20-5-5 streak that recently surpassed the mark set by Michael Jordan. It should be interesting and worth watching how the fans in Mexico take to someone who has been one of the top figures to watch in 2019-20. 3. Last leg of the reunion tour Carmelo Anthony is 1-1 so far against his former teams, notching a win vs. the Knicks on Dec. 9 (following a loss to the Thunder on Dec. 8 ). He\u2019s got a trip to Denver up next ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) in what could be a semi-emotional moment for him. After all, who knows how much NBA he has left in his system and Denver was the place he enjoyed the longest playoff run of his career. He seems to get up for this game, too, as he averages 23.7 ppg vs. Denver in his career (14 games)."},{"id":30084,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-lakers-keep-rolling-win-streaks","date":"2019-12-12","title":"5 stats to know as Bucks, Lakers keep rolling","content":" The Lakers and Bucks, for varying reasons, remain the two hottest teams in the NBA. For Milwaukee, their sizzle is based on their win streak, which reached 16 games in a 127-112 romp against the New Orleans Pelicans. The Bucks pulled that win off without defending Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who missed the game because of soreness in his right quadriceps . Los Angeles has won five in a row overall, but more notably has 12 straight road wins after last night\u2019s 96-87 victory against the scrappy Magic. As these two teams continue to burn up the NBA standings, we\u2019ve got a couple of numbers you should know about each of them.  * * * 1. Milwaukee\u2019s winning streak is the longest in the NBA this season and the franchise\u2019s longest since the 1970-71 season . The Bucks (22-3) are tied with the Los Angeles Lakers (22-3) for the league\u2019s best record . Should both teams keep rolling as they have been, the Dec. 19 showdown between the teams in Milwaukee ( 8 ET, TNT ) will provide an early tie-breaker. Win streaks of this length are a good omen for playoff success \u2014 seven of the 12 team s to win 18 or more games in a row in NBA history have gone on to win the NBA title. For the record, the longest win streaks in NBA history are as follows: 33 games ( 1971-72 Lakers ), 27 games ( 2012-13 Heat ), 24 games ( 2015-16 Warriors ), 22 games ( 2007-08 Rockets ) and the Bucks\u2019 streak from 1970-71. 2. Not since the days of Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain and Gail Goodrich has L.A. been rolling like this on the road. Last night\u2019s victory against Orlando gives Los Angeles its longest road win streak since the 1971-72 season, when the Lakers set the mark for the longest win streak ever ( 33 games ) en route to winning the NBA championship. As ESPN Stats and Info notes , the previous three times the Lakers recorded double-digit win streaks, the team advanced to The Finals.  3. As mentioned above, the Lakers are also in the midst of a five-game overall win streak. That is the third win streak of five or more games this season for L.A., which, based on recent history, is the harbinger of at the very least a playoff spot. This five-game run marks the 12th regular season since 1999-2000 in which the Lakers have had multiple win spanning at least five games in a single regular season. Here\u2019s a look at how those seasons panned out each time. 4. The Lakers and Bucks both sit at 22-3, which puts both teams in some unique air. Per Elias Sports, this is just the second time in NBA history that two teams have started 22-3 or better through the first 25 games in a season. The last time it happened was in 1993-94, when the Houston Rockets and Seattle SuperSonics both started out 22-3. That season couldn\u2019t have been a sharper contrast in finishes, though, for the teams. The Rockets, behind the play of MVP Hakeem Olajuwon, went on to win the first of their two consecutive championships. As for the Sonics, it wasn\u2019t such a great finish \u2014 they became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 8-seeded team in a playoff series as they lost 3-2 to the upstart Denver Nuggets . 5. Among some NBA fans, the long-held belief is that the Eastern Conference is overall more weak than the Western Conference. (And if you think that, the latest edition of our Power Rankings would like a word .) The Bucks haven\u2019t just been filling up on East wins, though, this season. Last night\u2019s win against the Pelicans improved Milwaukee to 8-1 against West foes, which is the best mark in the East . And, if you want to take it back to the start of the 2018-19 season, the Bucks are tied with the Raptors when it comes to an East team having success against West opponents."},{"id":30032,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-bj-armstrong","date":"2019-12-12","title":"Hang Time Podcast: BJ Armstrong on playing with Michael Jordan, advice for young players + more","content":"Sekou Smith is joined by former Chicago Bulls guard and current agent BJ Armstrong to discuss his basketball journey, playing alongside Michael Jordan in Chicago, player development and his advice for young players. * * * Subscribe to the Hang Time Podcast on Apple Podcasts or Spotify for new episodes throughout the season!"},{"id":30052,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-nba-academy-special-olympics-nba-cares","date":"2019-12-12","title":"Pistons, NBA Academy and Special Olympics share special NBA Cares clinic in Mexico","content":" MEXICO CITY \u2014 It was hard to tell who enjoyed themselves the most Tuesday at the Arene de la Ciudad de Mexico: the overjoyed children from the Special Olympics, the picture-taking teenagers from NBA Academy Latin America, or the Detroit Pistons themselves. All three parties met for an NBA Cares clinic, putting the league\u2019s most human element front and center the day before the 2019 Mexico City Games tip off. \u201cThese are the events that you look forward to the most,\u201d said Pistons forward Blake Griffin. Instead of hammering home slam dunks, Griffin tapped in the shots that Special Olympics children missed. When a shot went in on its own volition, the Pistons players celebrated like it was a game-winner in April. The NBA Academy prospects did pushups after each make, inciting further smiles and giggles from the kids who loved every minute of the all-too-rare experience. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day they get to see NBA players,\u201d said Andre Drummond. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day they get a chance to see any of this. Just to be in a nice facility, shooting basketballs, dribbling and having a great time with their peers.\u201d One small boy in a wheelchair was thrilled when his turn to shoot came, but not to take a shot himself. Instead he bounced a pass to Blake Griffin, who was quick on the uptake and banked in a short jumper. Happy with his assist, the boy told him \u201cgood job\u201d in Spanish. Derrick Rose was at the other end of the court, sending bounce passes to a young girl who smiled wide at every catch from and throw to the former NBA MVP. \u201cFor me, this is a little more personal,\u201d admitted Drummond. \u201cThis touches home for me because I am a global ambassador for Special Olympics. It\u2019s a humbling experience to be out here and just shed some light on these kids and spend some moments with them.\u201d Earlier that same morning, NBA Academy prospects were floored when they found out they would spend time with the players that serve as the embodiment of their own goals. Esteban Roacho, a 17-year-old from the northern city of Chihuahua, was all smiles after meeting Rose, his favorite player. \u201cOur dream feels bigger when we\u2019re here with them in the arena,\u201d Roacho said. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be in the league since I was a little kid.\u201d Pistons coach Dwane Casey, who played a preseason game in Mexico during his tenure with the Seattle Supersonics, was all too aware of the impact this week could have on the country\u2019s young fans. \u201cYou may catch one young kid that gets interested in basketball, falls in love with the game because of Blake Griffin, because of one of our players, then we\u2019ve accomplished something.\u201d"},{"id":30081,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-davis-building-connection-la","date":"2019-12-12","title":"LeBron James, Anthony Davis bring new 'Heat' to L.A.","content":"The relationship they formed, nurtured and maximized to the championship fullest was captured in all its glory nine years ago this month on a sensational play that took maybe six seconds. Dwyane Wade grabbed a loose ball and ran up court, leading a rather routine fast break and then, chemistry happened. He gently tossed a short, no-look bounce pass that for a microsecond went to a ghost, at least until LeBron James, trailing the play in full sprint, appeared and scooped the ball. Wade didn\u2019t see LeBron behind him \u2026 he just knew. LeBron didn\u2019t call for the ball \u2026 he just knew. As LeBron elevated and cupped the ball for a tomahawk dunk , Wade kept running forward and spread his arms before the crowd, as if to say: This is how we do it. That finish was immortalized by an Associated Press photographer seated underneath the rim named Morry Gash. The image instantly went viral, causing witnesses to gasp at the image\u2019s snarky, arrogant and amazing glory. Mostly, though, that sequence symbolized the blossoming bond between LeBron and Wade early in their time together with the Miami Heat. https:\/\/twitter.com\/MiamiHEAT\/status\/1202940853418938368 And, it suggests what\u2019s currently percolating in Los Angeles with the Lakers. LeBron has a new basketball bud, and the process with Anthony Davis is starting to look strikingly familiar. Theirs is an already devastating combo that has the Lakers scorching through the early NBA season with the best record in the West . \u2018Bron and The Brow are both entertaining and effective, a combination that certainly works in L.A. (which expects both). This is more of the peanut butter-and-jelly variety than fingernail meets blackboard in terms of two forces blending in beautifully. They share the same ideas about how to play the game as one, when to defer (and when to take over) and why there\u2019s no need for ego or one-upmanship. It\u2019s a tag-team, your-turn-my-turn type of existence, sprinkled with an ability to recognize each other\u2019s tendencies. Oh, and it helps that they like each other as people. Longtime Laker witnesses might feel the urge to compare this to Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant, but a more apt linkage is LeBron and Wade, whose on-court kinship spilled over into their personal lives, and to this day they still refer to each other as brothers from other mothers. \u201cWe had something special,\u201d James said. And now, with Davis? \u201cEverything\u2019s coming along great, maybe even quicker than we thought.\u201d As the Lakers prepare to play Friday in Miami \u2014 the site of so many LeBron-Wade connections \u2014 the NBA\u2019s new combo is just getting ramped up (Editor\u2019s update: Lakers won game 113-110 ) . No All-Star duo in the league is generating more wins, sizzle and per-game production than LeBron and Davis, who average a combined 53.6 points, 15.8 rebounds and 14.1 assists per game. They\u2019re durable, too: LeBron has played in every game while Davis has missed only one. Much of this was expected when the Lakers traded for Davis and gave LeBron someone who was arguably his equal in terms of talent. The pairing seemed ideal because Davis is a low-maintenance star who doesn\u2019t always demand the ball and keeps his ego hidden \u2014 necessary tools when one plays in LeBron\u2019s orbit. They also tend to cover each other\u2019s weaknesses. For example, Davis is a superior defender while LeBron, who turns 35 in a few weeks, picks his spots defensively. Davis took the Pelicans to the semifinals once , while LeBron has played in eight of the last nine Finals. One other critical element worth noting is this: LeBron is anxious to grab at least another title here with his third team, which would be unprecedented. Davis is hungry for his first. They share the same quest, then, but approach it from different angles. Given where they are in their careers, there was a hunch they were made for each other. After 25 games, this notion has proven correct. \u201cThey hit the ground running right from the start of training camp,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel. \u201cBoth on and off the basketball court, their chemistry has been seamless.\u201d LeBron seemed determined to make this work after his first season in L.A. lacked a true co-star and was slowed by a groin injury . His basketball relationship with Kyrie Irving in Cleveland took a sharp turn three seasons ago when Irving demanded to a trade , mainly to escape LeBron\u2019s enormity and strike out on his own. LeBron, like almost everyone else, was stunned as to why someone was so willing to bail on an all-time great. That raised this issue: while LeBron is one of the most accommodating superstars in NBA history, other stars in their prime would rather be the lead singer on another team. Davis seems cut from another cloth, however. And besides, when LeBron eventually retires (he has two seasons left on his contract), Davis will become a solo king if he so desires. This process was months in the making as LeBron made a point to align himself with Davis off the court since last summer. He welcomed him into his home, inviting him to events and generally magnetizing himself to Davis, who in turn did the same. This same approach worked for LeBron and Wade in 2010, but back then, LeBron was joining Wade\u2019s team and was careful not to overstep any boundaries. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing here is how much time they spent together away from the court last summer and how that has impacted what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cEven in film sessions the two are always together. They\u2019re just building that friendship that LeBron and Dwyane had. LeBron has done everything in his power to make sure he\u2019s going out of his way to make Anthony comfortable.\u201d Wade and LeBron became fast friends because their personalities were similar and therefore clicked. Wade admitted that, at times, it was difficult to ride shotgun that first season together. But he respected LeBron\u2019s talents too much to make that an issue. It all worked as they won two championships and made four Finals together. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra recognizes what\u2019s developing in L.A. and says about LeBron: \u201cHe\u2019s able to morph into whatever he needs to be to bring out the best from other players. This just fits like a glove with LeBron and AD, the way they work well together. Their skill sets compliment each other.\u201d The Bron-Brow combo is causing defensive hell for teams: Which one gets a double team? Do you put a big player on LeBron and a shorter one on Davis or vice versa? Last Sunday, the two combined for 82 points against the Timberwolves, which came two nights after they dropped 70 on the Blazers. Scoring only tells so much, but the way they compliment each other is nearly perfect. LeBron handles the ball, Davis impacts the rebounding and defense. They can almost sense where the other is without looking. Together, their sneaker prints are all over the floor. \u201cThe more time you spend together, if you have the same goals in mind and you have the same drive, then organically it happens,\u201d LeBron said. Much of this is new to Davis, who only got a half-season\u2019s worth of playing time with an All-Star (DeMarcus Cousins) his six seasons with New Orleans. He welcomes the change of synergy because playing next to LeBron ups his championship odds. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a tremendous teammate, great talent and takes a lot of pressure off not only me, but everyone else,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be on the floor with him.\u201d That\u2019s evident from everyone who has watched this relationship take root and grow. \u201cIt\u2019s there, and I think it\u2019s genuine, too, from what I can see,\u201d said former Lakers great and James Worthy, now a TV analyst for the club. \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a while now, and they have that same drive and vision about the game and how it\u2019s played. I think they know how to monitor each other and the team constructively to where the cohesiveness remains tight.\u201d What\u2019s frightening is the process hasn\u2019t even reached a half-season. The wavelength LeBron and Wade once enjoyed can be matched with Davis, and it\u2019s on pace to be fully maximized by the playoffs. The better it gets for Bron and Brow, the better it is for their supporting cast. \u201cFor me and AD, it starts with us,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cIf we\u2019re on the same page it makes it easier for the rest of the ball club.\u201d There\u2019s an important duplication taking place in Los Angeles, from LeBron-Wade to LeBron-Davis. The initial results are decisively promising. If this all keeps up, might multiple championships also follow? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Leonard received his championship ring to deafening applause and chants of \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d before the Los Angeles Clippers visited the Raptors on Wednesday night. Earlier, the three-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP said he was expecting a mix of cheers and boos from Toronto fans who watched him lead the Raptors to a six-game victory over Golden State in June. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some cheers but definitely, I think, more boos because they want to win the game,\u201d Leonard said at shootaround. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be cheering for a player that\u2019s on the opposing team.\u201d Leonard\u2019s former teammates, along with coaches and team executives, gathered in a circle at center court before tip-off to greet their former star, who signed with the Clippers in free agency. Leonard embraced each player in turn before guard Kyle Lowry presented him with his ring. After slipping it on, Leonard raised his arms to the crowd and waved. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to see guys get a ring, especially when they\u2019re on your team now,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said before the ceremony. \u201cThis is a different one, though. It\u2019s a really cool one because he was the leader of the group, coming back to get it in front of a crowd. I\u2019ve never experienced it like this. This is special. It\u2019s cool.\u201d Back in Toronto for the first time since his free agency meeting with the Raptors in July, Leonard said he experienced \u201cflashbacks\u201d of that championship run as the Clippers drove to the arena for morning shootaround. \u201cThe ride was fun,\u201d Leonard said of his season in Toronto. \u201cI had a great time last year with the coaching staff, the front office, and the players. It was a great experience. \u201cObviously it was different playing here for a whole country, they\u2019re all going for this one team.\u201d Leonard averaged 30.5 points and 9.1 rebounds in 24 playoff games with Toronto. He hit a series-winning 3-pointer in Game 7 against Philadelphia in the second round, a shot that bounced off the rim four times before dropping. Rather than re-sign with the Raptors, Leonard chose to team up with friend Paul George and head home to Los Angeles, signing a three-year deal with the Clippers. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be there, having a great time,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThese guys are a great team right here. We\u2019re striving for a goal and I\u2019m having a great time.\u201d Toronto acquired Leonard and guard Danny Green from San Antonio in July 2018, sending franchise icon DeMar DeRozan as part of the package to the Spurs. Leonard said the decision to leave the Raptors wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI took my time, I didn\u2019t hurry up and make a quick decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked to the front office in deep detail. It was a hard choice to make.\u201d Leonard is averaging a team-leading 25.1 points in 18 games for the Clippers. He\u2019s missed seven games, including Monday\u2019s win at Indiana, the second game of a back-to-back, sitting out because of a sore left knee. Rivers said he hadn\u2019t spoken to his star forward about the reception he\u2019d get from Raptors fans. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to players about stuff like that,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s so personal. You never know how they handle it, but it\u2019s got to touch you in some way.\u201d The Clippers saw George get booed in his return to Indiana on Monday, but Rivers didn\u2019t expect Raptors fans to give Leonard the same kind of treatment. \u201cHe fulfilled his promise,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he promised a championship, but he fulfilled it anyway. I think it will be an amazing reception.\u201d Before Wednesday, Leonard had only seen pictures of Toronto\u2019s championship rings, which are the biggest in league history.

The Bucks announced that Giannis Antetokounmpo will not play against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) because of soreness in his right quadriceps. Antetokounmpo is averaging 30.9 points, 13.2 rebounds and 5.5 assists this season and has a streak of nine consecutive games with 25 or more points while shooting 50% or better. This will be his first missed game of 2019-20 (last season, he missed 10 games). Milwaukee has won 19 of its last 20 games and is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA\u2019s best record at 21-3. A victory against the Pelicans would push the Bucks\u2019 win streak to 16 \u2014 the second-longest run in team history. It would also give the Bucks their best start in franchise history through 25 games. Antetokounmpo, the reigning Kia MVP winner, is averaging career highs in scoring and rebounding and is on pace to join Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain (twice) and Elgin Baylor as the only players to average 30 points, 13 rebounds and five assists in a season. Antetokounmpo also leads the NBA with a season-best 13 games of at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. His absence means the Bucks will likely rely on Donte DiVincenzo, Wesley Matthews, Ersan Ilyasova, Sterling Brown and Pat Connaughton to try and replace some of Antetokounmpo\u2019s production. DiVincenzo has played particularly strong defense during the Bucks\u2019 streak , averaging 1.8 steals per game, while Matthews has upped his production as well (9.8 ppg, 41.8% on 3-pointers)."},{"id":30077,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kawhi-leonard-leaving-was-hard-choice-make","date":"2019-12-11","title":"Kawhi Leonard says leaving Toronto was 'hard choice to make'","content":" Toronto has waited since the summer for tonight, readying for its chance to see Kawhi Leonard back at Scotiabank Arena. Had free agency played out differently, Leonard might still be delighting Raptors fans as they go about defending their 2019 NBA championship. A massive media contingent was on hand for the LA Clippers\u2019 shootaround Wednesday morning as Leonard prepares to face his old team tonight ( 7 ET, ESPN ). Leonard opted to sign with the Clippers on July 6, six days after free agency 2019 opened in the NBA. In talking with reporters today, Leonard shared that his move from Canada to California was hardly an easy one. \u201cI gave [re-signing with Toronto] a big consideration,\u201d Leonard said . \u201cI took my time, I didn\u2019t hurry up and make a quick decision. I talked to the front office in detail. It was a hard choice to make.\u201d The Raptors are expected to give Leonard, the reigning Finals MVP, his championship ring tonight. Toronto put up billboards outside the arena, one of which read \u201cFun Guy In Town\u201d with a photo of Leonard celebrating the 2019 championship, and another one reading \u201cBoard Man Gets His Ring\u201d that shows Leonard holding the Finals MVP trophy aloft. Leonard, who endorses New Balance, had a \u201cThank You Toronto\u201d billboard put in downtown Toronto and explained why he did so in his comments Wednesday. \u201c(The fans) were amazing last year. They rolled with us through the ups and downs,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe were down every series pretty much and they stuck through it with us. They brought great energy to every game and it helped us. So that\u2019s my thank you to them.\u201d It is hard to imagine Raptors fans booing Leonard after his play sparked the team to it\u2019s greatest season ever. Still, Leonard is remaining realistic about what to expect from his Toronto homecoming. \u201cI mean there will be some cheers but definitely I think more boos because they want to win the game,\u201d Leonard said . \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be cheering for a player that\u2019s on the opposing team.\u201d Any concerns Raptors fans have about Leonard\u2019s load management getting in the way of him suiting up tonight can also rest easy.

Gearing up for a Sweet 16 If you\u2019re not paying attention to the winning streak the Bucks have working right now, you\u2019re missing out. If it can keep things rolling tonight in New Orleans ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ), Milwaukee will tie the second-longest win streak in team history. It won\u2019t be easy, though, as Giannis Antetokounmpo is missing the game because of soreness in his right quad. Doing so would perhaps also align the Bucks with a season to remember: 12 of the 27 teams that won 16 or more games in a season went on to win the NBA championship that season . 2. Welcome back, Kawhi For the second time in as many seasons, Kawhi Leonard is returning to an old haunt . This time, he\u2019s back in Toronto ( 7 ET, ESPN ) and this should be a trip full of warm wishes and memories of the Raptors\u2019 run to the 2019 championship . Aside from all the expected warm fuzzies and tributes, this is a true game worth watching as it pits two squads not that far removed from each other record-wise (Leonard\u2019s Clippers are 18-7; the Raptors are 16-7). Leonard will also be looking to atone for his last performance against an East heavyweight, when he finished with 17 points on 5-for-14 shooting in last Friday\u2019s blowout loss to the Bucks. 3. An encore in O-Town? The last time we saw Anthony Davis, he was dropping an old school-flavored 50-piece on the Minnesota Timberwolves . The Magic play host to the Lakers ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and defense in the paint may decide this one. Orlando has the league\u2019s No. 1 shot blocker in Jonathan Issac (2.9 bpg) \u2026 who is just marginally ahead of Davis in that category (2.7 bpg). Davis also must deal with a fairly stout Magic defense, which ranks 9th in Defensive Rating and has allowed just one player \u2014 Bradley Beal \u2014 to score 40 or more against them this season. 4. Feats of strength in Indiana Based purely on the standings, the Pacers (15-9) and Celtics (17-5) are only separated by three games. As they meet tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ), the chasm between them in terms of \u201cquality\u201d wins couldn\u2019t be bigger. This is the first showdown between the teams since their 2019 first-round series , but Boston has recent wins against Miami, Denver and Brooklyn while Indiana has struggled to perform in marquee games. Adding to the woes for the Pacers is Gordon Hayward, who scored 14 in his return to the lineup Monday and who, at times, diced them up in the 2019 series. 5. Do the lower-seed shuffle Did you have the Jazz as a preseason top-four seed out West and the Thunder, Wolves, Suns and Kings out of the playoff mix? Shows what you know. Tonight\u2019s action could further jostle those preconceived notions as Utah heads to Minnesota ( 8 ET, League Pass ), the Grizzlies visit the Suns ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and the Kings host the Thunder ( 10 ET, League Pass ). Those teams comprise the No. 6-10 slots out West and, by night\u2019s end, we could have a very much changed picture there."},{"id":30083,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-mexico-city-games-5-storylines","date":"2019-12-11","title":"5 storylines to watch during the 2019 Mexico City Games","content":" For the fourth straight season , Mexico City will play host to two NBA regular season games: Mavs vs. Pistons on Dec. 12 ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and Spurs vs. Suns on Dec. 14 ( 5 ET, NBA TV ). The league is sending a record four different teams for the 29th and 30th games played within its southern neighbor\u2019s borders. Community events, service projects and clinics will sandwich the games themselves, making for an entire week of NBA outreach in Mexico. Here\u2019s a look at five key storylines that will develop within one of the largest cities in the world. * * * Latin American media \u2014 and subsequently their consumers \u2014 will immediately flock to the players and personnel that speak their language. That list is headed by two extremely familiar names. As if talent wasn\u2019t enough, Dallas superstar Luka Doncic also has the Spanish language in his arsenal from his days of playing professional basketball as a teenager with Real Madrid . The Slovenian sensation is fluent and will likely hit it off with local fans (if his highlights haven\u2019t already done that for him). Phoenix point guard Ricky Rubio will be the other most recognizable figure for Latin American basketball fans. The 29-year-old has been a fixture on the Spanish national team and was inundated with questions in his native language during a pre-Mexico conference call with the media last week. There is a reason Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors jerseys remain incredibly popular in Latin America. Superstars (and teams) are remembered and celebrated long after their heyday. This week\u2019s games offer up a bevy of talent, and it should be easy to see which players draw the most enthusiastic following. Doncic figures to be an early favorite in this regard. At the tender age of 20, he\u2019s already a Kia MVP candidate and figures to be good for a long, long time. The odds of him being an immediate fan favorite are more than solid, especially given his fluency in the local language. This trip will mark Devin Booker\u2019s second trip to Mexico City. The last time he was here in 2017 , the Phoenix Suns guard dropped back-to-back 39 -point games to the delight of the local fans. Throw in the fact that his maternal grandfather hails from Nogales, and Booker has all the groundwork to further his own prominence in the region. Detroit boasts one of the league\u2019s best rebounders (Andre Drummond) and popular former MVP Derrick Rose. San Antonio, meanwhile, represents the most recent NBA champion of the four teams as well as the closest NBA market to Mexico City. That city annually welcomes over two million overnight Mexican visitors, making San Antonio one of the league\u2019s natural gateways between the two countries. f3ca9dba811d\u201d data-width=\u201d100\u2033> NBA Cares will be out in full force this week. The league\u2019s global social responsibility program will host a clinic on Wednesday, followed by a project performed by the Phoenix Suns on Friday. The league has also planned a referee clinic on Friday.  The country\u2019s first official NBA Store in Mexico City opened its doors on Tuesday. In doing so, Mexico joins the United States, Manila, Italy, China, Taiwan and the Phillippines as countries with physical NBA Store locations. This gives fans a place to see, customize and purchase current merchandise of their favorite teams and players. Such initiatives further emphasize the league\u2019s commitment to Mexico, which has hosted more NBA games than any country other than the United States and Canada. While Mexico is the host country, the entire Latin American sports community will be taking in the games on a worldwide scale. In addition to the local and NBA League Pass broadcasts, ESPN Deportes and Televisa will help deliver the Mexico City Games to more than 200 countries and territories. In turn, those viewers will see NBA action backdropped by capacity-size crowds (both 2018 Mexico City games sold out) inside the Arena Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. The break in routine, location and foreign interest in the games will lend an almost exhibition-like atmosphere, but these are regular season contests that will count in the standings. San Antonio (9-14) boasts the worst record of the four teams, but even they are only two games out of eighth place out West. A win over the current eighth-place team (Phoenix) now could make all the difference later. Dallas, meanwhile, has carved out a spot for itself at the contenders table. Championship hopefuls typically don\u2019t mess around against teams with significantly worse records, yet Detroit has won four of their last five. Blake Griffin and the Pistons appear to be rounding into shape after Griffin missed the first two weeks of the season. This week will mark a celebration of basketball for Mexico and the Latin American community, but that won\u2019t diminish the impact a loss will have on two of these teams."},{"id":30049,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/butler-tweaks-young-after-improbable-comeback","date":"2019-12-11","title":"Jimmy Butler gets last word on Trae Young after improbable comeback","content":"In a classic case of famous last words, Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young made the unfortunate decision to crow \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d after feeding teammate Alex Len for a dunk that put his squad up by six over the Miami Heat with just 59.9 seconds remaining in Tuesday\u2019s contest.

As Leonard returns to The Six, where he helped the Raptors bring home their first NBA title , we take a look at six unique aspects that have made the self-described \u201cfun guy\u201d an unprecedented star player. * * * 1. One-year superstar rental: Raptors president Masai Ujiri rolled the dice in trading for Leonard , who was entering the final season of his contract, and set to become a free agent after last season with no guarantee he would re-sign in Toronto. But the move paid off significantly as the only successful one-year superstar rental in recent history with Leonard taking the Raptors on an exciting championship run. We can\u2019t credit Leonard solely for the title, as the San Antonio Spurs also sent one of the NBA\u2019s premier three-and-D players in Danny Green to Toronto as part of the trade. But you can\u2019t deny Leonard\u2019s impact in averaging 26.6 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists during his load-managed 60-game regular season, only to take those numbers up another notch in the playoffs (30.5 points, 9.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists) on the way to the championship. 2. Traded twice for a team\u2019s beloved player, the right move both times: San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich readily admits the difficulty he experienced in trading point guard George Hill \u2014 one of his favorite players \u2014 to Indiana on Draft night in 2011 for Leonard, a relative unknown at the time, as well as Davis Bertans and Erazem Lorbek. In fact, many of the team\u2019s veterans such as Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili took exception to the move. \u201cYeah, that was tough [to trade Hill],\u201d Popovich said in 2016. \u201cI always made the joke with you guys that he was my favorite player. Then I called my favorite player and told him he wasn\u2019t here anymore. So that was really tough. But those kinds of trades are the best because it worked out for both teams. It was what Indiana needed, and it was what we needed.\u201d Fast-forward to July 2018, and it happened again, this time with Ujiri moving Toronto fan favorite DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl, in addition to a first-round pick in exchange for Leonard and Green. In both instances, the trade proved most beneficial to the team landing Leonard, as the forward followed up by capturing NBA Finals MVP awards at both stops. 3. Went from being drafted outside the NBA lottery with no jump-shot to becoming an all-around elite player: First off, you have to remember the Spurs front office needed to convince Popovich to approve the Draft-night trade for Leonard. At the time, pundits viewed Leonard as capable of developing into a great defender. But nobody expected him to shoot 49.3% overall and 37.6% on 3-pointers as a rookie . By the time Leonard\u2019s fifth season rolled around, he was knocking down 44.3% from range, finishing the 2015-16 season ranked just behind J.J. Redick and Stephen Curry in 3-point accuracy . Credit Spurs assistant Chip Engelland with Leonard\u2019s development as a shooter along with former San Antonio assistant Chad Forcier. Interestingly, just a year after Leonard joined the Spurs, Popovich declared the forward the future of the franchise before the club\u2019s first practice headed into his second season. That\u2019s quite a feat for an unheralded player from San Diego State drafted with the 15th pick by Indiana. 4. Stealthily lures another superstar with years left on his contract: Everyone knows Leonard is not a big talker in public settings. But behind the scenes is a different story. Leonard\u2019s successful recruitment of George, who signed a four-year max contract to stay in Oklahoma City in 2018, illustrates the point. With the LA Clippers vying for Leonard\u2019s services as well as the Lakers and Raptors, the two-time Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year told Doc Rivers and Steve Ballmer during a free-agency meeting that he wanted to play with George , who was locked into his OKC contract. Leonard reportedly reached out with a recruiting pitch to George and the rest was history. Coincidentally, both Leonard and George were drafted by the Pacers in successive years . Now, they\u2019ve got a shot at deleting the Clippers off the list of one of three NBA franchises to never advance to a conference final. 5. Load management: Leonard certainly didn\u2019t invent \u201cload management\u201d as it has been around for several years, but he\u2019s helped to popularize the practice due to the results. Remember, Leonard missed all but nine games of the 2017-18 season because of tendinopathy in his right quadriceps, leading to distrust between the forward and the Spurs that ultimately led to his exit to Toronto. But the truth is Leonard hasn\u2019t actually played in both games of a back-to-back set since the 2016-17 campaign. Once Leonard arrived in Toronto, the Raptors adopted a load management program that limited the forward to just 60 regular-season games. The forward showcased the benefits of the program on the floor in the playoffs by averaging 39.1 minutes with increased production in scoring, rebounding and assists while shutting down Giannis Antetokounmpo over the last four games of the Eastern Conference finals . 6. Realistic chance to become first to win Finals MVP with three different teams : If Leonard leads the Clippers where they\u2019re expected to go, he could become the first player to capture Finals MVP honors with three different teams. On the way to killing two NBA dynasties \u2014 the Miami Heat and Golden State Warriors \u2014 Leonard took home Finals MVP trophies . This time, the competition will be stiffer with an improved Bucks team lurking out East and a gauntlet to face out West, led by the Lakers, featuring LeBron James and Anthony Davis. But Leonard winning another Finals MVP award with a third team definitely isn\u2019t unrealistic. It would indeed be unprecedented. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Yet to Portland star guard Damian Lillard, there\u2019s no reason to think of toiling anywhere else in the NBA. Lillard took to The Players\u2019 Tribune to pen a piece about how loyalty has been a hallmark of his career and wants to carry that over to his time in Portland. In the piece, titled \u201cLoyalty Over Everything,\u201d Lillard explains how he will do everything in his power to remain a Blazers for life. \u201cI\u2019m saying, you think you know how deep this goes, but you have no idea,\u201d Lillard wrote. \u201cWhen I say that I will never, ever switch up on the city of Portland, I mean what I say. When I say that I will never, ever switch up on this organization, I mean what I say. \u201cThey might switch up on me. That\u2019s business. That\u2019s basketball. But I will never switch up on the city. I don\u2019t want it easy. I\u2019m drawn to the struggle. When I came here, we hadn\u2019t won a playoff series since 2000. You had so many injuries to franchise guys like Brandon Roy and Greg Oden over the years, and it\u2019s so tough to come back from that. Even going way back, you had All-Stars like Clyde Drexler and Bill Walton who didn\u2019t choose to end their careers as a Blazer. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be that. I\u2019m going to carry that. I\u2019m going to bring a ring to this city or go down swinging.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Lillard has vowed his allegiance to the Blazers, doing so over the summer when he inked his super-max extension with the team that will pay him $196 million over four seasons . The No. 2 scorer in Portland history, Lillard said taking the franchise\u2019s scoring crown from Drexler has long been one of his career goals. Lillard is currently 4,545 points shy of Drexler for that mark, but is already the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in 3-pointers made and attempted and free throw percentage. In his Players\u2019 Tribune piece, Lillard also references his series-clinching game-winners against the Houston Rockets ( in the first round of 2014 ) and his 37-point 3-pointer against the Oklahoma City Thunder ( in the first round last year ). He says those shots \u2014 dubbed by some as a bad attempt \u2014 were just what he had in mind and all a part of his story. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so funny to me, when people want to talk to me about the buzzer-beater against OKC, or the one against Houston \u2014 like, \u2018That\u2019s a bad shot.\u2019 \u201cYou think I was improvising? You think I was panicking? You think I didn\u2019t know exactly what I was doing? \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up playing in a lab, bruh. We didn\u2019t grow up getting boxes of shoes in the mail. We didn\u2019t grow up with a trainer and a video team. That shot is 20 years old. I\u2019ve been making it since 2001 on a milk crate on Beverly Ave.\u201d The Blazers have struggled in 2019-20, though, getting off to a 5-9 start before opting to sign former All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony to a deal. After an 0-3 start with Anthony in the lineup, Portland won three straight \u2014 but has since dropped three of its last four games. Anthony\u2019s deal was guaranteed for the rest of the season, but Portland is 9-15 to date and in 12th place in the competitive Western Conference. Injuries have undoubtedly played a role in damaging the Blazers\u2019 high hopes this season. Last season\u2019s starting center, Jusuf Nurkic, is still recovering from left leg surgery. In addition, starting forward Rodney Hood tore his Achilles last Friday and will miss the rest of the season. Veteran big man Pau Gasol was added in the offseason, but never played a game for them because of a foot injury. In late November, he was waived by Portland and then rejoined it as an assistant coach .

That he\u2019s still getting booed by Hoosier faithful two-plus years after being traded is as much about the feelings he crushed leaving town as it does acknowledge what was lost. George spent seven seasons in Indiana, earning All-Star honors and leading the franchise to back-to-back Eastern Conference finals. But he\u2019s elevated his game to another level since then. He finished third in the 2018-19 Kia MVP race while playing alongside the 2017 Kia MVP Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City. And despite a late start to this season after another trade request (and offseason shoulder surgeries), George has played his way into the conversation again alongside reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. That delayed start is the only thing that\u2019s held George back. As his 36-point performance in Indiana showed (and with Leonard out), George has had no problem getting back to form. He\u2019s playing on a contender now and whether Leonard is available or not, George has been a catalyst for the LA Clippers. To date, George is averaging 23.9 points and shooting 41.9% on 3-pointer as well as 6.4 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.4 steals per game. He\u2019s been even better in the seven games Leonard has missed, averaging 29.2 ppg (50% overall, 46% on 3-pointers, 92% on free throws). He was missing from the Ladder early on this season, but he\u2019s clearly making up for lost time now. Luka\u2019s streak turns 19: I appreciate the humility shown by Luka Doncic when he was asked about passing Michael Jordan for the longest 20-5-5 streak since the Hall of Famer\u2019s run in 1989. Luka pushed back on any statistical comparison between his work and what Jordan accomplished. Yes, the numbers don\u2019t lie. But give the young fella credit for respecting his elders. Going streaking:  Saying the Milwaukee Bucks are the NBA\u2019s best team right now is beyond the understatement of this young season (see their recent pasting of the Clippers for proof). For perspective on just how good Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks have been so far, a keen observer shared this nugget: The 14-game win streak the Bucks took into Monday\u2019s game against Orlando matched the combined total win streak of the entire West entering Monday\u2019s games. Players of the Week: Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat are perfect at home this season. And that\u2019s without having a full roster available due to injuries and other issues. Butler\u2019s been outstanding, though, leading and creating an atmosphere that allows youngsters like Bam Adebayo, Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro to thrive. Anthony Davis won top honors for the West as the Lakers continue to lead the pack. Whatever the through-the-roof expectations were for Davis when the Lakers traded for him , he has by all measures exceeded them. He\u2019s not only the early frontrunner for Kia Defensive Player of the Year, he\u2019s got a clear chance to upset the top of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Now, let\u2019s get into your comments about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Max DeLeon Dec. 7, 2019 | 2:59 a.m. I can\u2019t understand why LBJ is ranked higher than AD when AD is doing better in terms of scoring, rebounding and efficiency. And what about impact to the team? With AD, the Lakers are now the league leaders. That did not happen when LBJ arrived in LA. From:  Nathaniel Mosley Dec. 7, 2019 | 5:50 p.m. Mr. Smith, You\u2019re my dude on NBA news, but gotta say that [Pascal] Siakam on the top 5 MVP and Anthony Davis not in that mix got me feeling a certain way. Keep up the good work. * * * My response: This is the great dilemma of the Ladder, Max. How in the world do you weigh LeBron\u2019s contributions to the Lakers against what AD is doing for them? They\u2019re both critical to the cause, of course. But in very different ways. And I hate to make you feel a certain way, Nathaniel. AD has played lights out this season, as good as I\u2019ve seen him at any point previously. How much of that has to do with him playing alongside LeBron? We know LeBron has been the main ingredient for elite, championship-level teams throughout his career. Seeing him operate at this level this deep into his career is something we\u2019ve come to expect from him. AD\u2019s talent has always suggested he could be this type of player, but only now are we seeing him do it on a legitimate championship team. If there\u2019s any way of separating the two of them right now, albeit ever so slightly, it\u2019s there. And we\u2019ll see where they both fit on the next Ladder in a few days. Right now, it\u2019s still up for healthy debate. From:  Yehuda and Yonat Tucker Dec. 7, 2019 | 5:54 p.m. Hey Sekou! This is Tucker. Greetings from all the fans from Israel and all of luck to Deni Avdija! I agree with every word except for 2 things. 1.  I believe that everyone in the NBA can shoot 35 shots and make 11 of them, which is the reason I think Harden is too high. The reason he scores so much is because of free throws. 2.  I understand that winning is one of the most important standards in the MVP ladder, but you can\u2019t ignore the fact the Trae Young is averaging 28.8 ppg on 46% from the field and nearly 40% from 3-point range in only his second year! It is not Trae\u2019s fault that John Collins is out, so it\u2019s not his fault that they are losing. From:  Austin Duff Dec. 6, 2019 | 1 p.m. How can you leave Trae Young out of the top 15 players? He\u2019s currently fourth in scoring and fifth in assists. He\u2019s coming off a great week \u2026 what more can he do? What do you have against him? * * * My response: Shout out to you, Tucker, and all of the NBA fans in Israel and around the globe. Like Austin, you\u2019re looking for a reason as to why Trae is not ranked higher on the Ladder. We all know the answer \u2026 and it has nothing to do with his play. He\u2019s been outstanding. But much like Bradley Beal in Washington, it\u2019s extremely difficult to justify a top-15 spot to a guy whose team is so far removed from the playoff picture at this early juncture of the season. Trae and Beal deserve serious All-Star consideration and should be included in that mix in a couple of months. That context is totally different for MVP candidates, at least to me. We must have some measure of separating these players and team success goes a long way in that regard. From:  Alex Rhodes Dec. 6, 2019 | 4:29 p.m. You have Domantas Sabonis in your MVP Ladder at 15 but DeMar DeRozan is averaging 21.4 points on 50.8% shooting. He\u2019s also averaging almost five assists per game. I would like you to take this into consideration. My MVP Ladder is: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Luka Doncic 3 . LeBron James 4. Anthony Davis 5. James Harden 6. Pascal Siakam  7. Devin Booker 8. Kemba Walker 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Kawhi Leonard 11. Joel Embiid 12. Karl-Anthony Towns 13. Paul George 14. DeMar DeRozan 15. Nikola Jokic * * * My response: You make an interesting point, Alex. Those are very good numbers DeRozan is putting up this season. It\u2019s too bad the Spurs have struggled the way they have. The narrative would be totally different if the Spurs were the Spurs we\u2019re used to seeing. They are far from that group right now, and for the foreseeable future. Your list looks pretty good other than that. From:  Hashem Dasan Dec. 6, 2019 | 4:06 p.m. Do you think age and seniority as well as seasons played is a factor in whether or not a player would receive MVP consideration? When is the last time a player won MVP in his second season in the league? (Referring to Doncic). * * * My response: Great question, Hashem. I think age and seniority factor into the conversation at certain points. Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld won Rookie of the Year honors and MVP honors in the same season. At 22 years and six months old, Derrick Rose was the youngest Kia MVP winner ever . The last time we had someone win MVP honors in their second season was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). He won the first of his record six MVPs during the Bucks\u2019 1970-71 championship season. Doncic has mounted a spirited challenge so far this season. But he can\u2019t let up for a moment, not if he\u2019s serious about joining that elite club. From:  Shane King Dec. 6, 2019 | 12:51 p.m. \ufeff My MVP list from a couple days ago matched yours. Nikola Jokic to me has fallen far off the radar. Where\u2019s the Joker from last season? * * * My response:  Short and sweet, Shane. I love it. \u201cThe Joker\u201d we got used to seeing last season has been missing in action for the most part this season. He did come out a bit over the weekend. Much has been made about Jokic showing up to camp out of shape. He has more work to do but is at least on the road to getting back to the player who earned All-NBA first team honors last season. From:  Landon Bangerter Dec. 6, 2019 | 10:09 a.m. \ufeff Hey Sekou \u2026 your friendly MVP Ladder buddy is back again. I really like the diversity of teams on your list. But I still think we need to look at second-best players on a couple of these teams that deserve some recognition. I\u2019m mainly talking about Fred VanVleet and Eric Bledsoe, who have been great for their teams, but then there\u2019s also Bam Adebayo and Tobias Harris, who deserve MVP praise as well. I have also opted to not count sixth men for the MVP Ladder anymore. What you\u2019ve said makes sense. Therefore, they will be omitted. H ere\u2019s my personal list updated: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) 2. LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) 3. James Harden (Houston Rockets) 4. Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers) 5. Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) 6. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors) 7. Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat) 8. Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers) 9. Fred VanVleet (Toronto Raptors) 10. Eric Bledsoe (Milwaukee Bucks) And five more: Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat), Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers), Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics), Kemba Walker (Boston Celtics) * * * My response: Thanks as always for coming through with your own twist, Landon. I don\u2019t know if I can rock with Bledsoe and VanVleet on the list, though. Both are playing well for their respective teams. But MVP candidates? I don\u2019t know about that. That seems like a huge stretch on both counts. I applaud you for thinking outside of the box, though. #salute From:  D. mcfunkerdoodle Dec. 7, 2019 | 1:35 a.m. \ufeff I emailed you last week, but I\u2019m not sure if you got the email. Anyways, first off, great job on the MVP list so far \u2014 although we might as well give the birthday boy (Giannis) his present. There is one thing I would like change, though. That is giving Andre Drummond a spot on that list. I\u2019m not a Pistons fan whatsoever, but I still have to respect the former UConn center. When you see a man who\u2019s averaging around 17 points, 17 rebounds, two steals and two blocks per game, you think of an MVP candidate. Losing record or not, the man is having a season not so different to a typical Moses Malone season (Rest in Peace, Moses). Either or, I hope you take this into consideration and thank you for your time. * * * My response:  Somehow I missed your first email. My apologies. With a name like D.mcfunkerdoodle, though, you\u2019re already winning. As for Drummond, he runs into the same problem a lot of good players run into when we start talking MVP: if you can\u2019t win MVP on your own team, there\u2019s almost no way to justify inserting a player into the MVP Ladder mix. From: Cole Patel Dec. 6, 2019 | 7:58 p.m. Devin Booker should be higher on the list because last year it took 42 games for the Suns to get 10 wins, and this year it took half that many games with Booker as the front runner. This year, Booker actually plays defense and is still getting his numbers on offense. He\u2019s also getting the same great numbers as last year, but this time he\u2019s on a better team, and he\u2019s had great efficiency. So far, Booker is one of the best players I\u2019ve watched this season. * * * My response: Cole, I\u2019ve been a Booker backer from the moment he declared for the Draft. It\u2019s good to finally see him playing on a team that has hope that better things are on the horizon. He\u2019s primed for his first All-Star season if he keeps this up. An elite scorer and shooter who is an underrated defender, Booker can drop 30 without breaking much of a sweat. Having him in the top 15 mix is a testament to all the work he\u2019s done the past few years. * * * From:  Cole Patel Dec. 6, 2019 | 7:57 p.m. Devin Booker should be higher on the Kia MVP Ladder because he is putting up the same stats as last year but with better efficiency, and he\u2019s actually an OK defender now, and the Suns are finally a good team even without Ayton because of Booker * * * My response: Wait a minute, \u2026 you coming at me from all directions, huh Cole? Sneaky but efficient, nice touch.. From:  Jason Dunn Dec. 6, 2019 | 7:40 p.m. I keep hearing \u201cNobody saw this coming\u201d, and \u201cDid anyone think the Dallas Mavs would be this good?\u201d I guess I\u2019m that guy. Yes, I fully expected them to be this good. The surprise to me is how Donovan Mitchell hasn\u2019t gotten any better in Utah. * * * My response: I disagree on your second point, Jason. I don\u2019t think Donovan Mitchell has plateaued or anything like that. The Jazz have introduced some significant changes to their core and he\u2019s had to adjust like everyone else. He\u2019s still one of the rising young talents in the league. Don\u2019t sleep on Spida! From:  Price21 Dec. 6, 2019 | 7:52 p.m. LeBron is not an MVP.

All-Star big man showdown in Philadelphia The Sixers are 12-0 at home and have been impressive of late no matter where they play thanks to 10 wins in their last 12 games. Tonight\u2019s matchup with the visiting Nuggets ( 8 ET, TNT ) not only puts that glimmering home mark on the line, but features a Joel Embiid vs. Nikola Jokic center showdown. For those who forgot, the Nov. 8 matchup between the two was a thriller and was capped off by Jokic drilling the game-winning shot with 1.2 seconds left . 2. Heat try to stay perfect at home, too Miami\u2019s 10-0 mark at home hasn\u2019t come without its thrillers, including Sunday\u2019s nail-biter against the Bulls . The Heat have a 1\/2 game lead on the Sixers as the Hawks pay a visit ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and can\u2019t afford a misstep in the race to stay among the East elite. While Jimmy Butler, Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo get a large part of the credit for Miami\u2019s success, don\u2019t overlook Duncan Robinson. He\u2019s shooting 48.8% on 3-pointers over his last six games \u2026 and that comes after going 5-for-15 on 3-pointers in his last two games. Additionally, should the Hawks\u2019 Vince Carter play in this one, it will mark the 1,500th game of his career. 3. The \u2018Melo reunion tour rolls on First it was a matchup with (and loss to) the Thunder on Sunday. Tonight, it\u2019s a game against the Knicks ( 10 ET, League Pass ). After that, there\u2019s the final stop in the Carmelo Anthony reunion tour with a visit to Denver on Thursday . It\u2019s hard to believe the Anthony era with the Knicks ended just three seasons ago. There\u2019s little time for nostalgia for Portland though, as it keeps losing ground in the West chase with each passing game. 4. No. 42 forever in L.A. On this date in 1995, James Worthy became the sixth player in Lakers\u2019 history to have his jersey retired. The team hoisted his No. 42 jersey to the rafters at halftime of a game against Detroit. Worthy, who played in 926 regular-season and 143 playoff games for the Lakers over 12 seasons, was also a member of NBA championship teams in 1985, \u201987 and \u201988."},{"id":30144,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-win-streak-reaches-15-games","date":"2019-12-10","title":"5 stats to know about Bucks' 15-game win streak","content":"The Milwaukee Bucks keep chugging along and racked up their 15th straight win on Monday after a 110-101 victory against the Orlando Magic. That win gave Milwaukee its longest winning streak since the early 1970s and got us thinking about some numbers you should know as their streak continues on. * * * 1. Milwaukee\u2019s winning streak is the longest in the NBA this season and the franchise\u2019s longest since the 1970-71 season . The Bucks (21-3) are tied with the Los Angeles Lakers (21-3) for the league\u2019s best record . Should both teams keep rolling as they have been, the Dec. 19 showdown between the teams in Milwaukee ( 8 ET, TNT ) will provide an early tie-breaker. Per the LandOfBasketball.com , seven of the 12 teams to win 18 or more games in a row in NBA history have gone on to win the NBA title. For the record, the longest win streaks in NBA history are as follows: 33 games ( 1971-72 Lakers ), 27 games ( 2012-13 Heat ), 24 games ( 2015-16 Warriors ), 22 games ( 2007-08 Rockets ) and the Bucks\u2019 streak from 1970-71. 2. The win against Orlando was a little closer than most of the Bucks\u2019 games had been (relatively speaking). Milwaukee had outscored its opponents by an average of 34 points over its last four games in notching wins against the LA Clippers, Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks and Charlotte Hornets. However, in beating the Magic by nine points, it marked the seventh game during this 15-game run that Milwaukee won by less than 10 points. Here\u2019s a closer look at each of the games the Bucks have won during the run by 10 points or less. 3. Speaking of scoring and margins and such, the Bucks have already accomplished a feat that puts them in the company of two past championship winners. Per ESPN\u2019s Stats & Info, the Bucks are the fifth team in NBA history to outscore their opponents by more than 320 points through the season\u2019s first 24 games. Two of the previous four teams to last accomplish this feat \u2014 the 1969-70 Knicks and the 2007-08 Celtics \u2014 went on to win the NBA championship. 4. In win No. 15, reigning Kia MVP winner Giannis Antetokounmpo was his usual beastly self. He tortured the Magic to the tune of 32 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists in 34 minutes. Orlando\u2019s Aaron Gordon and Khem Birch were Antetokounmpo\u2019s primary victims on Monday as he shot 8-for-13 against them to score 19 of his total points. Antetokounmpo\u2019s performance vs. Orlando also allowed him to continue his run of consecutive games with 25 or more points while shooting 50% or better. Here\u2019s a look at the players with the longest such streaks since the 1994-95 season: 5. The Bucks stand six wins from one piece of team history (longest win streak ever) and three wins from another mark as well.  The Bucks recently passed the season\u2019s quarter point and will play their 25th game of 2019-20 this week. The number 25 is significant because Milwaukee is on pace for its best start ever through that many games. Wednesday\u2019s showdown with the New Orleans Pelicans ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) will give Milwaukee a chance at its best start through the first 25 games of the season. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":30107,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bjelica-hits-winner-33-feet","date":"2019-12-10","title":"Horry Scale: Nemanja Bjelica hits game-winning 3 from 33 feet","content":"A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration.

In the protest, the Rockets argued that the officials misapplied the playing rules by failing to grant a Coach\u2019s Challenge in connection with James Harden\u2019s fourth quarter dunk, and that this error had a clear impact on the outcome of the game by depriving the team of two points. While agreeing that the referees misapplied the rules, Commissioner Silver determined that the Rockets had sufficient time to overcome the error during the remainder of the fourth quarter and two subsequent overtime periods and thus the extraordinary remedy of granting a game protest was not warranted. In addition, the league announced today that it has disciplined all three referees from the game for misapplying the Coach\u2019s Challenge rule. With 7:50 remaining in the fourth quarter and the score 102-89 in favor of Houston, Harden stole the ball and converted an uncontested dunk. The ball was dunked with such force that, as it cleared the net, the ball was propelled around the basket and upward, creating an initial appearance that it was not a successful field goal. Houston then called a timeout, and the officiating crew conferenced to discuss the play. After deliberation, the crew informed the Houston coaching staff that a basket interference violation had been called on Harden, and Houston asked for a Coach\u2019s Challenge. This request was denied by the officials because more than 30 seconds had elapsed from the start of the timeout. But the 30-second time limit for Coach\u2019s Challenges only applies when the challenge arises during a mandatory timeout or a timeout called by the opposing team. Because Houston called the timeout in this case, it was entitled to challenge the basket interference call upon being informed of it by the game officials. If the Coach\u2019s Challenge requested by Houston had been properly granted, instant replay would have shown that Harden\u2019s dunk was a successful field goal. As a follow-up to the NBA\u2019s investigation of this matter, the NBA will work with the Competition Committee to develop additional procedures to help prevent the situation with Harden\u2019s made basket from occurring again."},{"id":30108,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-week-jimmy-butler-anthony-davis","date":"2019-12-09","title":"Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis named NBA Players of the Week","content":" Miami Heat guard Jimmy Butler and Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis were named NBA Players of the Week for Week 7.

Through seven weeks, the East is the conference with eight teams at .500 or better , while the West only has six. The East has won 14 of the last 20 games played between the two conferences and has a winning record overall (60-59). But there\u2019s a healthy-sized drop-off after the top eight in the East (though the ninth-place Pistons have won three of four for the first time this season). In the West, teams 7-12 each have nine or 10 wins. The Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs have all had disappointing seasons thus far, but they\u2019re all just a game or two out of playoff position. That makes for a fascinating landscape with a large group of players becoming trade eligible on Sunday. Are teams like the Blazers, Kings and Spurs looking for upgrades? How many teams in either conference are ready to be sellers at this point? There are a few important games within that 7-12 range in the West this week. The Suns play two of them, hosting the Wolves (with whom they\u2019re tied at 10-12) on Monday and facing the Spurs in Mexico City on Saturday. At the top of each conference, the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers are cruising along.

Bucks go for 15 in a row The last time we saw the Bucks, they were busy making the Clippers look like a G League team in a blowout win Friday night . That put the Bucks\u2019 win streak at 14 \u2014 the team\u2019s longest since a 16-game run that spanned the 1972-73 and \u201973-74 seasons . With a home game against the Magic ( 8 ET, NBA TV ), they have a chance to extend the streak to 15. Throughout the run, Giannis Antetokounmpo has been stellar (31.9 ppg, 12.5 rpg, 4.3 apg, 1.3 spg) of course. But don\u2019t overlook how much Donte DiVincenzo (9.6 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.9 spg) has become a valuable bench contributor and defensive game-changer for Milwaukee during this span. 2. Hayward ready to return tonight Since Nov. 9, the Celtics have rolled up a 10-4 record , a mark that includes wins against the Mavericks, Nets, Heat and Nuggets. That Nov. 9 game is significant because that\u2019s when Gordon Hayward was lost due to a hand injury. He\u2019s back in the lineup against the Cavs tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), two weeks ahead of schedule. He recently told Celtics.com that the injury is completely healed , but he\u2019s still working to regain his full range of motion.  3. Important stretch begins for Indiana Considering the injuries and so-so start to its season, Indiana is in the midst of a successful run. At 15-8, the Pacers are within striking distance of the No. 3 seed in the East and have won eight of their last 10. However, three of Indiana\u2019s five losses have come against top-notch squads (Milwaukee, Houston and Philadelphia) and only one of those losses ( vs. the Sixers on Nov. 30 ) was by five points or less. Indiana has its first test to prove its true might as the LA Clippers ( 7 ET, League Pass ) visit. After that, four of the Pacers\u2019 next seven games are against playoff-level squads. 4. Break up the Thunder? A 1-4 start has given way to a respectable 10-12 current mark and, suddenly, Oklahoma City is a mere two games from .500 . A showdown with the Jazz ( 9 ET, League Pass ) awaits, and if Utah is to keep OKC at bay, it must account for reserve guard Dennis Schroder. He is averaging 17.5 ppg and shooting 47.7% over his last 15 games and was huge in last night\u2019s road win in Portland. 5. Rookie showdown in California If you\u2019re a Kia Rookie of the Year fan, we have a great matchup for you. The Grizzlies visit the Warriors to close out tonight\u2019s play ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ) in a game that may feature the top two rookie scorers : Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant (18.6 ppg) and Golden State\u2019s Eric Paschall (17.1 ppg). While the Warriors are in a decided downturn this season , Paschall has been consistent over his last 10 games and has the look of a true building block for Golden State.

However, he didn\u2019t do so with the typical barrage-of-3-pointers way most superstars get to the half-century mark in the NBA these days. His performance was one we had to dig into a little bit more and, in doing so, unearthed these stats facts for you: * * * 1. In leading the Lakers to a 142-125 win , Davis used a variety of methods to get to his 50 points (as his shot chart below can attest). Davis was 20-for-29 overall against Minnesota, but 16 of those 20 makes came in the paint. From layups to spin moves to transition basket feeds from LeBron James, Davis was definitely active around the basket all game long. And when he wasn\u2019t getting loose for easy baskets (he scored 15 fast-break points ), he was getting fouled \u2026 and making them count. Davis was 10-for-10 from the line, marking his second game this season in which he was perfect at the line (with a minimum of 10 free throw attempts). His last such game came on Nov. 22 against the Thunder , when he was 11-for-11 en route to a 33-point game.  Overall, Davis\u2019 line read as follows : 39 minutes played, 50 points (20-for-29 FG, 10-for-10 FT), seven rebounds, six assists, four steals and one block. \u201cIt was very special to do something like this in front of these great fans, a historical franchise and my teammates, especially the way we\u2019ve been playing,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt was nothing but amazing.\u201d Davis\u2019 old-school approach to getting to this milestone pleased his coach. \u201cNo 3s, 20 for 29, and then living at the free throw line, post ups, offensive rebounds, crashes, all those types of things. Just an old-school performance and one for the ages,\u201d Vogel said after the game . 2. In dropping 50 on the Wolves, Davis also became the first big man teammate of James to score 45 or more in a game. Previously, the five best performances by a James teammate were done by a guard (Kyrie Irving in Cleveland; Dwyane Wade in Miami). 3. To date, the Lakers rank in the top 10 in scoring (114.5 ppg) and 3-point percentage (37.0%) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage (49.0%) and ranking in the top 5 in Offensive Rating (112.9), Net Rating (9.4), Effective Field Goal percentage (55.2%) and True Shooting percentage (58.2%). In short, they\u2019re really potent on offense. That was on display Sunday against the Wolves. Their 142 points were the most the Lakers have scored in a regulation game since 1989. In addition, the Lakers have scored 278 points over their last two games, which are the most points scored in consecutive games since 1989 (when the Lakers had 281 points over two games). 4. Not to be outdone in all this is the performance of James himself. He had 32 points, four rebounds and 13 assists en route to helping he and Davis become the first teammates to have 50-plus points, 30-plus points and 10-plus assists in the same game. It may irk Lakers fans, of course, but the last time that happened it was a pair of Celtics legends who did it. On March 3, 1985 , Kevin McHale had 56 points and Larry Bird had 30 points and 10 assists (and 15 rebounds) in a 138-129 win against the Detroit Pistons. 5. Per ESPN Stats and Information, the 82 points James and Davis combined for was the most by a Lakers tandem since Feb. 2, 2009 . Back then, Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol dropped a combined 92 points on the Knicks (Bryant had 61, while Gasol had 31 and 14 rebounds). They are also the first duo to combine for 70-plus points in consecutive games since Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal did so in March of 2003 . Additionally, Davis\u2019 50-point game came in his 23rd career game with the Lakers. Per Elias Sports, only LeBron James ( 16 games ) and Cedric Ceballos (22nd) needed fewer games to reach the 50-point mark in L.A. (And, ironically enough, Ceballos\u2019 50-point game came on Dec. 20, 1994 against \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Minnesota). * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

But when you put on the sort of show Heat rookie Tyler Herro did Sunday night, going a little overboard was understandable. Herro rescued the Heat, closing the show by scoring 16 of their final 18 points and 27 overall to help keep the Heat a perfect 10-0 at home in a 110-105 win over the Bulls. The Heat are off to the best home start in franchise history, and they\u2019re doing it with youngsters like Herro, Bam Adebayo, Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn all playing critical minutes with veterans unavailable. With Jimmy Butler grinding through tight defense from the Bulls and Adebayo ailing late, hindered by a groin injury that he played through in regulation before finally succumbing in OT, Herro took over when the Heat needed it most. Herro drained a 3-pointer with 38.2 seconds to play in overtime, putting the finishing touches on the win and a second straight 20-point game following his 22 off the bench in Friday night\u2019s win over Washington. It was hardly the perfect game for the Heat, but they remain perfect here at home in what\u2019s turned out to be a surprising start to the Butler era given all of the injuries and adversity they\u2019ve had to face early on. The Heat also sit 11 games above .500 and third in the Eastern Conference. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise us,\u201d Butler said. \u201cNot too much should surprise the outside eyes. We\u2019ve got a really good team, with really good, young players, older players, middle-aged players. We\u2019re just locked in, man. And Tyler came up big for us.\u201d Herro\u2019s scoring was right on time against a Bulls team that outplayed the Heat for most of the game. \u201cIt\u2019s the next step in his NBA growth,\u201d said Adebayo, who finished with 21 points, a game-high 13 rebounds, six assists and three steals. \u201cWe know he\u2019s a great shooter. Now he just has to go out there and take big shots. He\u2019s taking full advantage of it and we need him to keep doing that.\u201d Herro\u2019s clutch shooting is a hallmark of his game that has translated from his schoolboy days in Wisconsin to his one season at the University of Kentucky and apparently now to his rookie campaign with the Heat. The bright lights don\u2019t seem to bother him much. \u201cYou saw him dig into games in college,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cIn the biggest moments, that\u2019s when he\u2019s playing his best. As we\u2019ve gotten to know him in the short period of time, you can see his confidence. If your max player trusts you at that point in a game, and Jimmy was looking for him, that says all you need to know. \u201cThe trust has been earned within our walls and Jimmy has seen what this kid can do in those situations. You see the confidence but can\u2019t really define it. You just see it in Tyler day by day.\u201d It\u2019s a look the rest of the league better get used to. Herro\u2019s fearlessness at crunch time isn\u2019t going away. \u201cI don\u2019t shy away from taking the big shot,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of confidence. Down the stretch, Jimmy trusted me with the ball, he got me in a good spot to knock down a couple of 3s. They picked their poison, either Jimmy or me. But there\u2019s another three guys on the floor with us that can hurt them too. They had to pick their poison.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The NBA will present its own variation of that iconic story structure this week when Carmelo Anthony, newly reborn with the Portland Trail Blazers, revisits the three most significant stops in his 17-year career during three consecutive games spanning five days. In rapid succession from Sunday to Thursday, the dusted-off, 10-time All-Star will face or visit Oklahoma City, New York and Denver, the franchises with whom he spent his first 15 seasons. It\u2019s not expected Anthony will be accompanied by any apparitions, just by his new Trail Blazers teammates as he goes team by team through his earliest days in the league. It\u2019s always possible he\u2019ll head out like Ebenezer in a bathrobe or, at least, one of his hoodies. The first two of these games will be at Portland\u2019s Moda Center, dialing down the nostalgia a bit. But come Thursday, Anthony will return to Denver, where his NBA days began back in 2003, to cap his stroll back in time. The schedule quirk seems notable enough for us to reflect on and assess his impact at each of the three stops. We\u2019re skipping his sorry sojourn to Houston last fall, where the Rockets kicked Anthony to the curb after just 10 games. And no, we\u2019re not going to count the nominal stints with Atlanta or Chicago, where his contract spent a combined 15 late-career days in 2018 and 2019, respectively, without the one-time scoring champ ever suiting up. \u201cI think Melo was consistent his entire career,\u201d said former NBA guard Chauncey Billups, a friend and foe who played three seasons with Anthony in Denver and New York. \u201cHe was one of the best offensive players I\u2019ve ever seen play. He was a matchup nightmare the whole time \u2013 even now, in the later stages, past his prime, he can still have certain nights where he can get going. \u201cAt 35 years old, with 16 or 17 years in the league, you can\u2019t say that about a lot of players. He\u2019s just one of those great scorers like that.\u201d Consistent across the years? Absolutely. Anthony has been a dangerous shooter and a load to defend when posting up. But he\u2019s had his tweaks. Not only was Anthony different in age and experience at each of his stops, so were the circumstances in which he played. And of which he\u2019ll be reminded this week. * * * Dec. 8: Thunder 108, Blazers 96 Anthony\u2019s line: 35 minutes, nine points (4-18 FG), eight rebounds, three steals Games: 78 Stats: 16.2 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.3 apg Shooting: 40.4 FG% \/ 35.7 3P% \/ 76.7 FT% Team\u2019s W-L: 48-34 (.585). Playoffs: One time in one year, 6 total games, lost in first round Coaches: Billy Donovan HONORS \u2022 None NOTES Anthony added OKC to his list of possible destinations in working out his no-trade clause with the Knicks. But with the deal finally triggering on Sept. 25, 2017, he felt air-dropped into a plan that already was in place. \u2026 He rejected suggestions that he come off the bench for the Thunder and in fact started all 78 games in which he appeared. \u2026 His 15.0 shots per game were only down about one per quarter from his Nuggets and Knicks hey days. An 8-12 start spooked everybody, but OKC rallied and had a shot at 50 victories before playing .500 ball over the final three weeks. \u2026 The wheels came off at the end, after the Thunder fell into a 1-3 hole in the first round vs. Utah. Anthony averaged 35.7 minutes and 14.3 points on 14.8 FGAs in the series\u2019 first four games. Then he was used for just 25.5 minutes in the final two, averaging 7.0 points on 6.5 shots. \u2026 His offensive\/defensive ratings were 101\/113 during the season, 90\/106 in the playoffs. QUOTES \u201cI had to tell myself, \u2018OK, this is different.\u2019 Russ did things his way here. Paul did things his way in Indiana. I did things my way in New York. We were all solo artists. So now the question is, how do you bring your solo artistry to this band?\u201d \u2013Carmelo Anthony \u201cI\u2019ve been on teams with bad guys. Bad guys don\u2019t interact with teammates. Bad guys don\u2019t care about anybody else. He\u2019s not that guy. The stuff that was being said about him in New York upset me. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s out of that situation.\u201d \u2013Guard Raymond Felton, a teammate in N.Y. and OKC \u201cThunder \u2018Melo was late in his career, so I throw that out.\u201d \u2013Clippers coach Doc Rivers Dec. 9: Blazers 115, Knicks 87 Anthony\u2019s line: 24 minutes, 16 points (5-13 FG, 3-4 3pt FG), four rebounds, two steals, one block Games: 412 Stats: 24.7 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 3.2 apg Shooting: 44.3 FG% \/ 36.9 3P% \/ 83.0 FT% W-L: 221-283 (.438) Playoffs: Three times in seven years, 21 total games, one series victory Coaches: Mike D\u2019Antoni, Mike Woodson, Derek Fisher, Jeff Hornacek. HONORS \u2022 Two All-NBA berths (2nd team, 2012-13; 3rd team, \u201911-12) \u2022 Six All-Star appearances \u2022 2013 scoring championship (28.7 ppg) NOTES This was the fame-and-money phase of Anthony\u2019s NBA career, playing in New York and maxing out his salary. \u2026 He made nearly $150 million in his seven Knicks seasons, and the mega-contract he signed in July 2014 paid him another $52 million after he left town in 2017. \u2026 That 2014 summer was Anthony\u2019s best shot at signing with a contender with plenty left in his tank at age 30. But he chose the most dollars possible, re-upping with a team in decline. Phil Jackson\u2019s arrival as team president brought coach Mike Woodson\u2019s firing and friction with Melo. Individually, Anthony was at the peak of his powers. During his New York stay, he hoisted 19.9 FGAs a night and got busy from the 3-point line (5.0). His share of shots from outside the arc (25.2 percent) doubled from his Denver years (12.1). \u2026 These were his best years for rebounds and assists, too. \u2026 Anthony had the highest PER (21.8), true shooting (.545) and usage rates (31.7) of any of his stays. \u2026 On 3\/10\/14, Anthony won his last conference player of the week award \u2013 until he snagged one last week with Portland. His best finish in MVP balloting came in 2013, placing third behind LeBron James and Kevin Durant but ahead of Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant. The Knicks went 54-28 and beat Boston in the first round before losing in six games to Indiana in the East semifinals. \u2026 Anthony cobbled together offensive\/defensive ratings of 109\/108. Since leaving New York he\u2019s been under water (104\/110). \u2026 During this era, his three buddies from the 2003 Draft \u2013 LeBron James (seven), Dwyane Wade (four) and Chris Bosh (four) \u2013 played in a combined 15 Finals and won a total of six rings. QUOTES \u201cIn New York, there was so much going on with the organization and the city. It was very tense up there, and you never really get a chance to have stability there. \u2026 That was the toughest part for me in New York, having to go in and go to work and still put a smile on my face and still deal with everything and not be as happy. Having the effects of that carry over to being around family and friends, being down so much but still having to be strong. It\u2019s pulls at you.\u201d \u2013Carmelo Anthony \u201cWe\u2019ve not been able to win with him on the court at this time. I think the direction with our team is that he is a player that would be better off somewhere else and using his talents somewhere where he can win or chase that championship.\u201d \u2013Former Knicks president Phil Jackson \u201cCarmelo\u2019s a great player. He can play in any system, whether it\u2019s slowdown \u2013 and we did a little bit of that early in the season last year [2016-17] \u2013 so he\u2019d have figured out how to fit in. But the team we have now [2017-18], this is the way we\u2019re playing and that\u2019s our focus.\u201d \u2013Former Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek \u201cI thought he had less help and more on his shoulders in New York. I thought he had more help and less on his shoulders in Denver. \u2026 The Knicks run \u2013 they really didn\u2019t have a run \u2013 he gets the blame. But when you look at everybody around him, they never were going to win with those teams. And then they fired the coach [Woodson].\u201d \u2013Doc Rivers \u201cWhen people ask me who is one of the toughest players to defend, and I say, Melo, they\u2019re always like \u2018Really?\u2019 Man, Melo \u2014 he was a fast, fat dude with hops. And can shoot. When he hit you with that first step, it was so quick, and then he\u2019s strong. People need to stop disrespecting Melo.\u201d \u2013Veteran NBA wing Andre Iguodala Dec. 12: Nuggets 114, Blazers 99 Anthony\u2019s line: 36 minutes, 20 points (8-16 FG), nine rebounds, one assist, two steals, two blocks Games: 564 Stats: 24.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 3.1 apg Shooting: 45.9 FG% \/ 31.1 3P% \/ 80.3 FT% W-L: 360-261 (.580) Playoffs: Seven times in seven years, 45 total games, 2-7 series record Coaches: Jeff Bzdelik, George Karl HONORS \u2022 Four All-NBA selections (2nd team; 2009-10, 3rd team; \u201905-06, \u201906-07, \u201908-09) \u2022 Four All-Star appearances \u2022 2004 All-Rookie first team NOTES Drafted on the heels of his NCAA championship turn at Syracuse, Anthony joined a Nuggets team that had gone 17-65 in 2002-03. A year later, they had improved to 43-39. \u2026 Denver made the postseason in Anthony\u2019s first season and each one thereafter, until he pushed his way to New York in a February 2011 blockbuster trade. \u2026 The Nuggets got to the first round in their first two post-Melo seasons, but then went the way of the Knicks for the next five years. Anthony averaged 21.0 points as a 19-year-old rookie and pumped it up from there, his 28.9 good for second behind Kobe Bryant (31.6) in 2006-07. \u2026 He got to the foul line 7.9 times per game, a knack that declined by 20 percent once in New York and has dipped below 3.0 at each stop since. \u2026 If you want to pick nits, Anthony was at his most turnover-prone (3.1), with a 1:1 ratio to assists. \u2026 Of the nine head coaches he\u2019s had, he and George Karl were together the longest. Probably his most turbulent times, too. QUOTES \u201cCarmelo was a true conundrum for me in the six years I had him. He was the best offensive player I ever coached. He was also a user of people, addicted to the spotlight and very unhappy when he had to share it. He really lit my fuse with his low demand of himself on defense. He had no commitment to the hard, dirty work of stopping the other guy.\u201d \u2013Former Nuggets coach George Karl (in his book, Furious George ) \u201cWhen he was with the Denver Nuggets, he was unstoppable and unguardable.\u201d \u2013Doc Rivers \u201cI always think about \u2018What if?\u2019 We were really close in Denver, a couple in-bounds plays from making the Finals [in 2009]. I was at the end of my prime, he was in the middle of his. He continued to get better. I always think about what could have happened if he would have stayed and we could have put other pieces around. \u201cI really think we could have got it done with that team. We were in position, right there, to be good for quite a while. But things happened. Melo wanted to move on, and he got what he wanted.\u201d \u2013Chauncey Billups, a teammate in Denver and New York * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Simmons hit his second career 3 and scored a career-high 34 points, and the Philadelphia 76ers didn\u2019t need Joel Embiid\u2019s help to rout the Cleveland Cavaliers 141-94 Saturday night. Simmons made 12 of 14 field goals, including his only 3-point attempt, and hit 9 of 12 free throws in 26 minutes to help Philadelphia improve to 11-0 at home. \u201cI was locked in,\u201d Simmons said. Simmons\u2019 jump shot \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 has been a hot topic in Philadelphia. He entered the season 0 for 17 from long range. Coach Brett Brown has repeatedly said shooting is a part of Simmons\u2019 game that will develop with time. After Saturday\u2019s performance, Brown publicly upped the ante and called for more from his All-Star point guard. \u201cThis is what I want,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI want a 3-point shot per game, minimum. \u2026 He will be liberated. His world will open up and, in many ways, so will ours.\u201d Embiid sat out with a left hip contusion. Darius Garland had 17 points for the Cavaliers, who have lost six in a row and 12 of 13. \u201cThey were going downhill on us all day long,\u201d Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. Philadelphia has been projected to be an NBA title contender, but the 76ers haven\u2019t been able to consistently field its starting five of Simmons, Embiid, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris and Al Horford. They have only started nine games together due to injuries and Embiid\u2019s two-game suspension for fighting Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns. The 76ers needed little more than Simmons in a dominant first half that ended with them ahead 77-36. Simmons attacked the basket often and showed off a rarely seen mid-range game when he drained an 11-foot jumper with 6:04 left in the second quarter. That had 76ers fans cheering, but it was just an appetizer for Simmons. With 3:41 left in the half, Simmons took a cross-court pass from Trey Burke and knocked down a 3 from the left wing. That send the sold-out crowd into a frenzy, and the roars continued when Simmons finished an alley-oop dunk from Burke on Philadelphia\u2019s ensuing possession. Simmons received a standing ovation at the next stoppage. \u201cI\u2019m getting more comfortable learning my spots and just adjusting,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to force it, trying to play the game I know how to play. Hard work pays off. Stay in the gym and keep working.\u201d Simmons finished the tremendous four-possession sequence with assists on Philadelphia\u2019s next two trips, first to Horford for a 3-pointer and then to James Ennis III for a jumper. Finally, Simmons ended the first half scoring with a 9-foot jumper for a 41-point lead entering the break."},{"id":30111,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/luka-doncic-michael-jordan-20-5-5","date":"2019-12-07","title":"Luka Doncic ties Michael Jordan with another game of 20-5-5","content":"Dallas Mavericks versatile star Luka Doncic has tied Michael Jordan for the longest streak of 20 points, five rebounds and five assists since the ABA\/NBA merger.

So with the LA Clippers playing at Fiserv Forum Friday on the night Giannis Antetokounmpo turned 25, coach Doc Rivers and his players faced a dicey choice: impolite or awkward. They opted for awkward, falling behind by as much as 41 points in losing 119-91 to an Eastern Conference counterpart with the same championship aspirations they have. \u201cIt was Giannis\u2019 birthday and we searched all over the city to find a gift,\u201d Rivers said afterward. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find one. So we gave him this one.\u201d Hello, is this mic on? The joke fell flat in the postgame media scrum. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can come up with. Best I\u2019ve got,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe were awful.\u201d The Clippers were that, particularly on offense (shooting 8-for-32 on 3-pointers and 21 turnovers, which led to 29 Milwaukee points). But that just made the Bucks by contrast shine so much more brightly in winning for the 14th consecutive time and 18th time in their past 19 games. This game had all the makings of a potential Finals preview. Both coaches acknowledged that there was a bit more buzz, with two heavyweights meeting with essentially healthy rosters and all their All-Stars all on board. The Clippers in particular were amped after practicing Thursday for the first time all season with both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard in the starting unit. And yet: \u201cI didn\u2019t think we played with any zip,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cYou could see from the beginning of the game. Offensively, we were so slow, so easy to guard as a group. \u2026 Their entire team was more physical. I felt they really looked at this game as a big game, the way they played. I thought we showed up to play a basketball game.\u201d That could get twisted into something dismissive \u2013 Y\u2019know, it was a bigger deal to Milwaukee \u2013 except that the Bucks just did, again, what they\u2019ve been doing for a while now. The last team to beat them was Utah back on Nov. 8, their lone misstep in a four-game Western trip. This streak of theirs is the franchise\u2019s longest since 1973, surpassed only by the 20- and 16-gamers Milwaukee had in its 1970-71 championship season. At 20-3, the Bucks have matched the best start through 23 games in team history, something they did both in 1970 and 1971 when they had another hoops freak of nature who needed only one name (Kareem). And now Milwaukee has won its last four games by 137 points, treating the Clippers (28) no differently from Charlotte (41), New York (44) or Detroit (24) all in the past week. That\u2019s the second-largest point differential over four games in NBA history (Sacramento outscored four foes by 150 in 1992-93). \u201cTo do what we did defensively and offensively was great,\u201d said Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer to 48 minutes of the kind of team we want to be.\u201d Antetokounmpo celebrated his birthday with 27 points and 11 rebounds, his 21st double-double and 20th 20-10 game. And he did it in 26:21, the very best kind of load management. Curiously, Rivers assigned forward Mo Harkless to Antetokounmpo. Never mind he has two of the best wing defenders at his disposal, with either Doberman capable of throwing the Bucks\u2019 attack out of whack by choking off its leader. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing all year. We start out games with other guys guarding their [best] guy,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cY\u2019know, Giannis didn\u2019t guard Kawhi either.\u201d OK, so the Bucks might want to keep their MVP from early foul trouble. But the Clippers have two. \u201cBut they\u2019re both coming off injuries, too,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThey\u2019re not 100 percent yet. The second half of the year, they\u2019ll do it more.\u201d Not against Milwaukee. These clubs are done this season, with the Bucks sweeping 2-0. Most of the Clippers\u2019 rotation guys got their turns in the tank against Antetokounmpo. And it worked all right, as he scored 10 points by halftime. In the third quarter, however, Antetkounmpo scored 13 points, including 10 straight early in which he blistered all comers with a layup, an alley-oop throwdown, a thunderous dunk and a 3-pointer from out front. Milwaukee\u2019s 35-19 edge in the period made it 87-62 with 12 minutes left. Surprisingly, Antetokounmpo said that not having Leonard or George locked in as his primary defender actually made his life tougher. \u201cYou know Kawhi and Paul George want to get into the passing lanes, want to get deflections,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir hands are always there. So now you\u2019ve got to worry about three guys basically, and not just Harkless. I think it\u2019s better when Kawhi is on me because you know, all right, he\u2019s right here. He\u2019s not helping. He\u2019s not in the passing lanes. He\u2019s not going to put his hands in when I\u2019m dribbling.\u201d There was no comeback in the Clippers. Leonard (25.0 points), George (23.5), Lou Williams (21.1) and Montrezl Harrell (19.1) typically combine for 88.7 points nightly. But they had 47 with a quarter to go Friday. And with 9:25 left, Rivers went white flag, sitting them all down. So Milwaukee, making a persuasive case as the NBA\u2019s best team, didn\u2019t have to gut out all 48 minutes after all. The night unexpectedly wound up a lot like Antetokounmpo\u2019s postgame menu. \u201cPiece of cake,\u201d he said. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But where\u2019s all the worry within the Warriors? There\u2019s a noticeable absence of doom and despair from a team that takes its lumps almost nightly, is stuck at the bottom of the West like gum on a hot summer sidewalk and would get flexed out of the Christmas Day schedule if the NBA could do it in a pinch. The mood around the 4-19 Warriors is mainly upbeat, at least before the jump ball and not long after the final buzzer. Get this: Draymond Green, known to combust even during championship times, has only been tossed once this season. Don\u2019t get it twisted; of course the Warriors would rather win regularly, as they did spectacularly the last five seasons . But while they lack a healthy win-loss record and seasonal outlook right now, they\u2019re maintaining a healthy perspective, and for good reason. They know, and we know, that this pain is temporary , and the fun returns next season when they can finally lift their finger off the reset button and put a superior product on the floor again You can classify this as a halftime break, a well-earned breather from an era where the Warriors worked from October into June for half a decade. So don\u2019t cry for the Warriors \u2014 not that anyone is actually doing so \u2014 especially because they aren\u2019t crying themselves. \u201cI\u2019m actually really enjoying this season,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cAnd that may sound strange.\u201d Some context is in order: Kerr isn\u2019t embracing all these Ls. He\u2019s merely taking a level of satisfaction from the sudden shift from the rigors of winning. All the expectations, demands, pressure, outside noise, egos and trying to motivate a historically-great team for several months are no longer on his shoulders. The drastic scenery change is giving Kerr a fresh outlook on basketball, the coaching profession and what\u2019s now required of him. It\u2019s a different sort of challenge that\u2019s rousting a new energy from within him. But the real reason Kerr and company aren\u2019t troubled by the current state of Golden State is the blueprint sitting in front of them, waiting to be realized in 2020-21. Seriously, it\u2019s borderline brilliant: Get a healthy Steph Curry and Klay Thompson back, rested and rejuvenated. Prevent Draymond from overload this season \u2014 he\u2019s currently taking his time allowing a bruised heel to heal \u2014 and unleash him this time next year. Finish low enough in the standings this season to increase the odds of landing a high lottery pick next June, and select such a player, or swap him for more immediate help. Determine if D\u2019Angelo Russell fits well within a three-guard rotation with Curry and Thompson \u2014 three players who can each drop 20-plus points a night \u2014 or trade him for a versatile swingman or proven rim protector.  Develop next season\u2019s supporting cast right now, with emerging young talent such as Eric Paschall, Glenn Robinson III, Ky Bowman and Alec Burks all getting plenty of playing time and doing promising things with it. You can safely project the Warriors as a championship contender if all of the above fall into place. Should they also get lucky and add a distressed star or a diamond in the rough, then they\u2019d vault right back into the favorite\u2019s chair, currently being kept warm by the Lakers, Clippers and Bucks. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a very different team,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWe won\u2019t have the same group that was in The Finals last year. We lost a lot from that group. But the whole point this year is \u2018let\u2019s get healthy, let\u2019s really try to develop these young guys and see if we can fortify our roster and develop some players who can be a big part of our future, bring back our regular guys and make a run at it again.\u2019 It\u2019s exciting.\u201d This could be a redux of the Spurs in 1996-97, Gregg Popovich\u2019s first year as coach. David Robinson was hurt early, and then Sean Elliott as well, and the Spurs went from 59 wins to 20. The reward was drafting Tim Duncan, who joined an already-solid team, and the rest is history. Next season the Warriors will bring a mix of championship proven stars still in their prime, a hungry veteran or two who can still produce in spots (think another Shaun Livingston or David West), a core of up-and-coming young players, and maybe the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 draft.  They\u2019re working on setting that table now, and the early returns are encouraging. Paschall was a second-round pick but if the All-Rookie team was chosen today, he\u2019d appear . That\u2019s a major bonus for an established winner such as the Warriors, who don\u2019t get the benefit of choosing high in the Draft every year. He\u2019s an undersized power player who makes up for a lack of height with desire, disciplined footwork and fundamentals. Then there\u2019s Robinson III, son of the \u201cBig Dog,\u201d who found himself trapped in a mid-career crisis before landing with the Warriors, his fifth team in six years. He\u2019s getting more minutes than ever and playing respectably, shooting 45 percent from the floor and 38 from deep. At the very least, Robinson is all but assured of getting another look from the Warriors next season, which is the goal. \u201cI came here for an opportunity and compete for a spot and showcase myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI took a gamble on myself after Detroit didn\u2019t pick up my option last summer. I knew this would be a good spot and a good opportunity. Always got to stay ready and take advantage of opportunity. \u201cThe culture here is all positive and all winning even when we\u2019re not winning. From the coaching staff to the player\u2019s mindset, it\u2019s great. You get to talk to Draymond, Steph and Klay, players who are locked in on winning. I\u2019ve learned so much from these guys, from Steve and the coaches.\u201d Robinson, Bowman and Paschall are what keeps Kerr motivated despite the losing. No coach can teach Curry how to shoot better or Kevin Durant how to score. In this situation, however, Kerr and his staff conduct practices of a different flavor. \u201cI enjoy the teaching part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got great young guys, eager to learn, competing every night. It\u2019s a totally different set of circumstances but for me as a coach I\u2019m taking a lot of satisfaction out of the details of coaching and the individual attention I have to give to young players. These young guys are fantastic. They are eager to learn. They are playing so hard. They are getting better. \u201cI think I\u2019ve learned how to be a better coach. I haven\u2019t had to coach a situation like this. It\u2019s been a good reminder that every circumstance is different, every year is different. The last five years we have been championship contenders. I had to manage the team through the season and prepare for the playoffs. This is much more about teaching and developing young players.\u201d The season and situation will get tricky when Curry and Thompson are finally cleared to play. Do the Warriors put them on the floor? Curry disputed a report last month that ruled him out. Most likely, the decision on Curry and Thompson will be an organizational group effort. In another few months, when the two players are healed and starting to round into shape, the Warriors could be completely buried in the standings with no hope of making the playoffs. So why bother suit them up, risk injury and also ruin a chance at a high Draft pick? Besides, as Kerr said, maybe the break is needed for mental reasons, too. \u201cI made a comment after we lost to Toronto that maybe we should just take a sabbatical, go to Italy and sip wine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was half-joking. It did feel our guys were wiped out. In an ironic way, not the way you draw it up, this is a time for Steph and Klay to maybe decompress. I don\u2019t know that anybody could fathom what it takes to go to The Finals five straight years. It\u2019s exhausting. Guys put everything on the line for five straight years, nine month seasons, where every game is the biggest game of the year for the opponent. My sense is it\u2019s kind of a good thing for some of our key guys.\u201d The Warriors have a reputation to keep and a splashy new arena to fill, and yet the most important task is preparing for next season. There\u2019s no sense of urgency from ownership or fandom to produce right now, given the circumstances, and especially after three championships. The Warriors bought themselves time and goodwill. In the absence of wins, that\u2019s their current currency, and they\u2019re wisely cashing in. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Knicks cut ties with Fizdale on Friday after two straight blowout losses dropped them to 4-18 and promoted assistant Mike Miller to interim head coach. Fizdale ran practice earlier in the day but was then fired along with assistant Keith Smart. The Knicks made no comment on the decision to release Fizdale after he went 21-83. The Knicks have lost eight straight games, with the last two by scores of 132-88 to Milwaukee on Monday night and 129-92 to Denver on Thursday night, which Fizdale called \u2018sickening\u2019 after the game. They have the worst record in the Eastern Conference after finishing with the worst record in the NBA last season in Fizdale\u2019s first season. The Knicks went 17-65 last season to match the worst record in franchise history and they are on pace to be even worse this season. New York missed out on the top stars that were available in free agency and the players they did get haven\u2019t meshed nearly well enough. Still, team executives expected better results, saying so with an unusual press conference to express their disappointment after a loss to Cleveland on Nov. 10 dropped them to 2-8. Team President Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry said then they remained confident in Fizdale. But things didn\u2019t get better from there, especially once the schedule turned tougher this month . And it led to the second straight quick exit for Fizdale as a head coach. The former Miami assistant led Memphis to the playoffs in his first season, but was fired after the Grizzlies got off to a 7-12 start in 2017-18 and he clashed with center Marc Gasol. New York will turn to its 13th coach since Jeff Van Gundy resigned in the 2001-02 season. The Knicks have been one of the worst franchises in sports since, with just a single playoff series victory and a current stretch of six straight losing seasons. They believed a turnaround could come this summer, when they had enough money to sign two superstars after trading All-Star Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas last summer. But Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving agreed to join Brooklyn in the opening hours of free agency and the Knicks had to move on to players that included Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Taj Gibson and Marcus Morris \u2013 who largely play the same position. The Knicks host Indiana on Saturday, then begin a four-game trip Tuesday in Portland. Fizdale replaced Jeff Hornacek after Hornacek had also lasted only two seasons. Perry and Mills interviewed 11 candidates before choosing Fizdale, who also was a candidate for other jobs. But the Knicks struggled early last season while Porzingis was recovering from a torn ACL,then appeared to be more interested in angling for lottery position than trying to win games after dealing him before he returned. New York ended up with the third pick and RJ Barrett, who has been one of the few bright spots thus far. But injuries and inconsistency have left Fizdale without an obvious answer as the starting point guard and the Knicks have managed a league-low 100.5 points per game \u2013 three worse than any other team. Miller joined the Knicks staff this season after four years in charge of the Westchester Knicks. He led the NBA G League franchise to a 108-92 (.540) record and was the league\u2019s coach of the year in 2017-18."},{"id":30175,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blazers-fully-guarantee-carmelo-anthony-contract","date":"2019-12-06","title":"Blazers fully guarantee Carmelo Anthony's contract","content":" The Portland Trail Blazers have amended the contract of forward Carmelo Anthony to be fully guaranteed for the 2019-20 season, it was announced today by president of basketball operations Neil Olshey.

We are more than one fourth of the way through the 2019-20 NBA season. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 7 weekend. * * *  The LA Clippers have the league\u2019s sixth-ranked offense . Just imagine how good they\u2019ll be when Kawhi Leonard isn\u2019t having the worst shooting season of his career. Through 16 games, Leonard has effective field goal percentage of just 47.9%, a mark that ranks 84th among 99 players with at least 200 field goal attempts and is the lowest mark in his nine seasons in the league. (One of those seasons doesn\u2019t really count, but still.) Leonard has shot a little worse from the perimeter. His effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint of 46.5% is down from 50.6% last season. But most of the drop has come in the paint. Last season, Leonard shot 60% in the paint, a number in line with his first seven seasons. This season, he has shot just 49% in the paint. And the drop-off has been about the distance from which he\u2019s shooting as it is makes vs. misses. Last season, Leonard took 496 shots in the paint , and 309 (62%) of those 496 shots came in the restricted area. This season, Leonard has taken 156 shots in the paint , and only 55 (35%) of those shots have come in the restricted area. Leonard has seen drops in both his shooting in the restricted area (from 68% to 60%) and on other paint shots (from 47% to 44%). But his drop in overall paint field goal percentage is bigger because his ratio of restricted-area shots to non-restricted area shots has basically flipped upside down. The percentage of Leonard\u2019s total shots that have come in the restricted area (17%) ranks 84th among the 99 players with at least 200 total field goal attempts. The percentage of his shots that have come from the restricted area or 3-point range (42%) ranks 97th among the 99. Leonard\u2019s mid-range game is a big reason why the Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship six months ago. He\u2019s one of the few players who should have license to shoot mid-range jumpers whenever he pleases. But even for those guys, layups are much better than those mid-range and non-restricted-area paint shots. And with the drop in restricted-area shots, Leonard has also seen a drop in free throw rate, from 38 attempts per 100 shots from the field last season to 31 this season. Leonard had a fast start to the season, averaging 27.0 ppg on an effective field goal percentage of 56% through his first four games as a Clipper. He\u2019s been pretty inconsistent since then, but the Clippers have been fine because they have so much talent around him. LA\u2019s game on Friday should be a great test, though. The Clippers begin a six-game trip in Milwaukee on Friday ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ), with the Bucks having won the first meeting (in which the Clippers had neither Leonard nor Paul George). The Bucks\u2019 defense ranks second in oppponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (54.2%) and leads the league in the (lowest) percentage of opponent shots that have come from the restricted area (26%). That Clippers-Bucks game is a potential Finals preview and a measure of East-West supremacy. The Western Conference has had the better record in interconference games in 19 of the last 20 years, with 2008-09 being the lone exception. It was assumed that trend would continue this season, and through the first quarter of the season, the East only has six good teams. But the West only has six good teams, too. The Oklahoma City Thunder are 8-12 and just a game out of eighth place . Through Thursday, the East and West are even (57-57) in interconference games. Through November, the West was 53-46. But the East won 11 of the 13 interconference games played over the first four days of December before the West rebounded with wins in New York and Toronto on Thursday. Entering the weekend, they\u2019re even, with the East\u2019s top six teams having played more games against the West ( 48 ) than the West\u2019s top six have played against the East ( 44 ). In 21 games played between the top six teams from each conference, the West is 12-9, though the East has a positive point differential (plus-15). The Bucks are 3-1 and teams 2-6 in the East are 6-11 after Toronto\u2019s loss to Houston on Thursday. With five interconference games this weekend \u2014 three on Friday and two on Sunday \u2014 the tie will be broken by your next East-West update (coming Monday in the Power Rankings ). Clippers-Bucks isn\u2019t the only matchup between the top six in the East and the top six in the West on Friday. Denver visits Boston ( 8 ET, ESPN ) on the second half of a back-to-back.  Here are your on-off-court leaders through Thursday \u2026 Don\u2019t look too deep into these numbers. In some cases, they\u2019re telling a story of what has happened over the last 6 1\/2 weeks more than they\u2019re telling a coach how to manage his rotation going forward. Some coaches take them to heart more than others. Near the opposite end of the list is Tyler Johnson. The Suns have been 16.8 points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor (plus-7.9) than they\u2019ve been with him on it (minus-8.9). After having a spot in the Suns\u2019 rotation through the first 18 games, Johnson has been DNP\u2019d in the last three. But Patty Mills is at the top of the list, because the Spurs\u2019 starters have been bad. Coach Gregg Popovich has made some changes to the lineup over the last few weeks, but three Spurs \u2014 Bryn Forbes, DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge \u2014 have started every game they\u2019ve played and have played 184 more minutes (446) than any other three-man combination on the team. The Spurs have been outscored by 7.3 points per 100 possessions, with some pretty horrific defensive numbers, in those 446 minutes. Mills\u2019 on-off differential is mostly about defense, with the Spurs having allowed 14.3 fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (104.4) than they\u2019ve allowed with him off the floor (118.7). That\u2019s the biggest on-off DefRtg differential among the 246 players who have played at least 300 minutes. Part of its is that he\u2019s playing against the opponents\u2019 second units, but that\u2019s clearly not the whole story. The biggest on-off differential on offense belongs to Trae Young, with the Hawks having scored 20.4 more points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (110.0) than they have with him off the floor (an incredibly anemic 89.6). Alas, Young also has the second worst on-off DefRtg differential among those 246 players, with Atlanta having allowed 16.9 more points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (118.0) than they have with him off the floor (101.1).  Two pairs of teammates are in the top 10 above. And prior to Thursday\u2019s games, the two Nuggets starters \u2014 Paul Millap and Will Barton \u2014 were at the top of the on-off differential list. As much scrutiny as Nikola Jokic has been under this season (and he certainly could be playing better), the Nuggets\u2019 starting lineup has been very good, outscoring its opponents by 14.0 points per 100 possessions in 366 minutes (111 more minutes than any other lineup has played ). And that number was plus-14.0 per 100 even before Denver\u2019s 37-point win in New York on Thursday, when a lot of the damage was done by the bench. But prior to Thursday\u2019s visit to Madison Square Garden, the Denver bench hadn\u2019t been holding onto leads as well as it did last season. The Nuggets brought back the top 10 guys in their rotation, added both Jerami Grant and Michael Porter Jr., and have been almost perfectly healthy through the first quarter of the season. But their depth hasn\u2019t been a strength. Even with all five guys in their second unit registering a plus-26 or better on Thursday, the Nuggets rank 17th in aggregate (estimated) NetRtg (minus-2.3 per 100 possessions), down from 10th (plus-1.3) last season. As noted in this week\u2019s Power Rankings , four Denver reserves \u2014 Grant, Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig and Monte Morris \u2014 have each seen big drops from last season in how well they\u2019ve shot. Collectively, they have an effective field goal percentage of 49%, down from 56.4% last season (counting Grant\u2019s shots with Oklahoma City). But for Denver coach Michael Malone, it goes beyond shooting. \u201cOur defense has been really good this year, and we\u2019re not getting the payoff as much as I think we should be,\u201d Malone said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re only getting 12 1\/2 fast break points per game . And when you defend and rebound at the level that we have, you would hope there would be more opportunities to get out and run. And that second unit, particularly, is really at their best when they can defend, rebound, and run and attack and play downhill.\u201d The Nuggets have registered 10.6 fast break points per 100 possessions with Morris and Beasley on the floor together, down from 12.4 last season . \u201cOverall, I think we\u2019re figuring it out, game by game,\u201d Morris said. \u201cNow that we got expectations, everything is magnified. But we just got to keep doing what we\u2019re doing, keep getting better, and the rest will take care of itself.\u201d The Nuggets remain in second place in the West entering the weekend. Thursday was, by far, the second unit\u2019s best game of the season. That comes with the context that they were playing the Knicks, but maybe that was the spark they needed. As noted above, Denver plays in Boston on Friday. They then finish their four-game trip Sunday in Brooklyn ( 3 ET, League Pass ) and Tuesday in Philadelphia ( 8 ET, TNT ).  P.J. Tucker is on his way to a third straight Corner 3 Championship. Through Thursday, the Rockets forward leads the league with 36 made 3-pointers from the corners. Tucker has actually attempted fewer corner 3-pointers per game (3.2) than he did last season (3.4). But he has shot much better on those attempts (52% vs. 39%). Most of Tucker\u2019s corner 3-point attempts are generated via the playmaking of Russell Westbrook (who has assisted on 17 of Tucker\u2019s corner 3-pointers) and James Harden (seven). And the Rockets do not run a lot of scripted plays. But at the start of a quarter, the Rockets will often run a play for Tucker in the corner. It\u2019s called \u201cpoint single weak\u201d and it\u2019s kind of brilliant in its simplicity. With Tucker in the right corner and a wing on the right wing, the Rockets will run a quick dribble-handoff on the left side of the floor. While that\u2019s happening the player on the right wing will meander toward Tucker\u2019s defender and set a screen, allowing the guard who took the dribble-handoff to zip a pass to the league\u2019s most prolific corner 3-point shooter. The video below starts with two examples of the original play, followed by a couple of variations. In none of the four examples does Tucker need to move from his spot. The Rockets rank 29th in player movement (10.6 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession). When they run pick-and-roll for Harden, the other three guys are relatively stationary, waiting for the ball should the defense leave them open. So it\u2019s kind of appropriate that they actually run a play for a guy who doesn\u2019t move at all. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

A gift for everyone Yes, it\u2019s the holiday season. But did you know that today is also Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s 25th birthday ? We don\u2019t have a gift for him, but he and the Bucks have one for us in the form of tonight\u2019s marquee showdown with the LA Clippers ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). Milwaukee is seeking its 14th (!!) straight win , the Clippers have wins against the Rockets, Celtics and Mavs in recent days and, of course, another round of the classic Kawhi Leonard-vs.-Giannis matchup looms here, too. Just watch this one already. 2. Getting down and dirty Consistent defensive effort has been an issue for Denver all season. A look at the NBA\u2019s team hustle stats leaders, however, shows the opposite in Boston . That means this showdown ( 8 ET, ESPN ) could hinge on which team \u2014 to use a little coach-speak \u2014 wants the win (and hustle plays) more. Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic will, of course, be critical tonight, especially after he torched Boston for a triple-double in Denver\u2019s win on Nov. 22 at Pepsi Center. 3. LeBron vs. Carmelo at Staples The results from the Carmelo Anthony addition may be starting to bear fruit, as Portland is 4-1 over its last five games ( after an 0-3 start when he came aboard). A game against the NBA-leading Lakers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) will test the Blazers\u2019 mettle as well as provide the latest chapter of LeBron James vs. Anthony , too. The pair has shared some classic moments and game-winners against each other and a chance to, if nothing else, go down memory lane makes this one worth ending the evening with. 4. On the rise in Orlando The Magic\u2019s schedule difficulty this month ranks around the middle of the pack in the East. Even though a difficult stretch lies ahead, Orlando is taking care of business against weaker foes and has won three straight as they visit the Cavs ( 7 ET, League Pass ). Give this one a watch if for no other reason than to watch Mo Bamba, who has been sharp over his last seven games (8.4 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2 bpg, 54% overall, 60% on 3-pointers). 5. Big return for Sacramento? Anything good (or bad) you want to say about the Kings\u2019 8-12 start must be tempered with the fact Marvin Bagley III has missed 19 of those games. The big man was cleared to return to contact drills yesterday and there\u2019s some hope he might suit up tonight in San Antonio ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). Given the wild nature of the West standings and that San Antonio is struggling as much (if not more) than Sacramento this season, Bagley\u2019s return could prove crucial. 6. The first time Kobe dropped 50 Nineteen years ago today, one of the NBA\u2019s all-time great scorers got into a bucket battle with a future All-Star and journeyman. A Dec. 6, 2000 showdown between the Lakers and Warriors became a one-on-one battle of sorts between Kobe Bryant and Antawn Jamison. This game was Jamison\u2019s second straight 50-point game, a notable feat. But more importantly, this was the first 50-point game of Kobe\u2019s career \u2014 and it came in a 125-122 overtime loss.

The leaders of the new school are already in place and they\u2019re poised to assert themselves as the NBA\u2019s cream of the international crop of superstars. The reigning Kia MVP ( Giannis Antetokounmpo ), Kia Rookie of the Year ( Luka Doncic ), Kia Most Improved Player ( Pascal Siakam ) and first-team All-NBA center ( Nikola Jokic ) are all global imports. All four rank among the top 15 players in this edition of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. In fact, Antetokounmpo (No. 1), Doncic (No. 2) and Siakam (No. 5) all rank in the top five. And Antetokounmpo and Doncic just became the first two international players to capture Player of the Month honors in the same month. In November, Antetokounmpo averaged 30.9 ppg, 13.4 rpg and 5.9 apg to lead the Bucks to the East\u2019s best record, while Doncic (30.8 ppg, 9.9 rpg, 9.6 apg) has the Mavs in the thick of the West playoff chase. Three of these four came basically out of nowhere with Doncic being the only one who was a household name. It\u2019s proof that this had to happen naturally: a group of international players \u2014 all under 25 years old \u2014 storming the ranks of the league\u2019s top players simultaneously. \u201cThis is what happens when you allow things to happen organically,\u201d a Western Conference executive said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not trying to squeeze prospects into spaces their talent can\u2019t live up to, when you\u2019re not trying to manipulate the process. \u201cGiannis is already there. He\u2019s locked in right now at the highest level. Luka is clearly on that path. He\u2019s got it all. Siakam is definitely getting there and Jokic, even though he\u2019s not in the sort of shape I believe he needs to be in to play at his best, is still arguably the most skilled big man in the league. This isn\u2019t like anything we\u2019ve seen in my time in the league. We\u2019ve had great international players, but not a wave of them heading into the primes of their careers simultaneously. It\u2019ll be interesting to watch where this all goes in the next few years.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 31.0 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.4 blocks Giannis resisted the urge to go outside the lines with Blake Griffin and instead took his frustrations out by demolishing the Pistons like the machine he\u2019s been all season. Tonight offers up another must-see matchup when the Bucks get their first look at a Kawhi Leonard-led LA Clippers squad (since he missed the last matchup on Nov. 6, which the Bucks won ). Last week: No. 4 Season stats: 30.3 points, 10.1 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 1.4 steals Doncic has turned the league into his own personal playground by dominating games with his scoring and playmaking . He\u2019s become an unguardable player just 21 games into his second season and is only going to get better as he continues to figure things out. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 25.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, 10.8 assists, 1.4 steals Don\u2019t let LeBron\u2019s uncalled misstep(s) in Wednesday\u2019s win over Utah take your attention away from the wicked work he\u2019s doing to propel the Lakers out West. He notched his 17th double-double of the season vs. the Jazz, which was also his fourth double-digit assist performance in his last six games. Last week: No. 5 Season stats: 38.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 7.5 assists, 2.0 steals The Raptors\u2019 defensive scheme Thursday didn\u2019t allow Harden to go off for one of his signature scoring games (he had 60 and 50, respectively, in his previous two games ). But his ultra-efficient 23-point night (on just 11 shots) opened things up for the rest of the Rockets as they handed Toronto just its second home loss of the season. Last week: No. 6 Season stats: 25.0 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists The reigning Most Improved Player is making a strong case for a second straight trophy, in addition to playing his way into the MVP conversation. Siakam is averaging career highs in points, assists, rebounds, 3-pointers made (2.4) and 3-point percentage (37.6%). Siakam is operating at a level above and beyond what was believed possible for him just two seasons ago . * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

The team said Thursday that Bagley is listed as day-to-day, but his status for the Kings\u2019 game Friday in San Antonio ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) remains unknown. Bagley had been out since Oct. 24 because of a non-displaced fracture in his right thumb. He was expected to miss 4-6 weeks after suffering the injury in the Kings\u2019 opening-night loss to the Phoenix Suns. James Ham of NBC Sports Bay Area reported Thursday night that Bagley will join the team in San Antonio but may not play vs. the Spurs. Sacramento has gone 8-11 during his absence, but has struggled of late, losing four of its last five games. In terms of strength of schedule for December, the Kings have the fifth-easiest path and are 1 1\/2 games behind the Suns for the Western Conference\u2019s No. 8 spot. Bagley, 20, averaged 14.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks over 62 games during his rookie season in 2018-19.

He\u2019s progressing very well. He feels very good about his process. And eight weeks is several days from now, and if we get outside of that, it will be because he hasn\u2019t met the metrics for return-to-play that are laid out for him and every player on our team. He will not be treated any differently in terms of the return-to-play metrics. \u201cNow we have been much more cautious with him in terms of how quickly we\u2019ve ramped him up from stage-to-stage because he\u2019s 19 and he\u2019s still growing and he was 285 pounds when he had the surgery. That\u2019s a different [type of] player, that\u2019s a diffferent [type of] person. It\u2019s a population of one. So we\u2019re obviously going to treat him differently as we ramp him through the stages. But there\u2019s been no other setback or mission afoot except to get him back on the court as quickly as possible.\u201d The Pelicans announced on October 21 that Williamson had surgery to repair a torn right lateral meniscus, sidelining him for the start of the regular season. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound former Duke star averaged 23.2 points in four preseason games before missing the final exhibition with right knee soreness. ESPN\u2019s Andrew Lopez reports that Williamson has returned to do some on-court work , which includes walk-throughs with the team and spot shooting. In an interview with the assembled media last month, Williamson himself was preaching patience about his recovery time and projected timeline. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed, the timeline has not changed,\u201d Griffin said Thursday. \u201cIf he hits those [return-to-play] metrics in seven weeks fine; if he hits them in 10 weeks, fine. We don\u2019t care when that is, but he\u2019s not getting on the court until he proves to us he\u2019s healthy, no matter what he wants to do.\u201d Griffin said that Williamson likely won\u2019t be playing in back-to-back games initially upon returning, with a likely gradual build toward \u2018full strength\u2019 in game situations. The delayed start, which stripped New Orleans of their starting power forward, has contributed to the Pelicans\u2019 disappointing 6-16 record thus far. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win basketball games and quite frankly we\u2019ve done a horrible job of that,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAnd where we might be failing in the short term, I think we\u2019re succeeding in the breadth of what we\u2019re trying to do, which is build a sustainable winner. And we\u2019re well on our way to that despite the current record.\u201d The 19-year-old Williamson turned pro after one season in college, during which he averaged 22.6 points and was voted to the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s All-Defensive Team. He also averaged 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 1.8 blocked shots.

Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, he can add a guaranteed contract to the ledger, with Portland \u201camending\u201d a previously non-guaranteed deal signed on Nov. 19 . After playing just 10 games for the Rockets in 2018, Anthony was eventually traded to the Bulls and the Hawks \u2014 without making an appearance for either team \u2014 before spending the beginning of the 2019-20 season without a team. He later acknowledged it could have marked the end of his career. \u201cI came to a point where I was willing to accept it either way,\u201d Anthony said after playing the first game of his 17th season with his sixth NBA team on Nov. 20. \u201cI had to get myself mentally prepared for that and I did, to be honest with you.\u201d In a video posted to his YouTube channel , Anthony said the deal came together in just a few days, though he had \u201ckept his eye on Portland\u201d and been in regular touch with All-NBA guard Damian Lillard. Anthony, who notably earned a standing ovation after a 19-point home debut in front of the Portland fans, is averaging 16.9 points and 5.9 rebounds while shooting 44.8% overall and 38.7% from 3-point range in 31.0 minutes. He faces off against fellow 2003 NBA Draft classmate LeBron James on Friday, when the Blazers host the Lakers in Portland (10:30 ET; ESPN). Just last week, Anthony told The Athletic \u201c this ain\u2019t no damn farewell tour \u201d following an impressive 25-point showing against the Bulls. Now, he\u2019ll have the rest of the season to make his case."},{"id":30212,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-20-kia-rookie-ladder-dec-5","date":"2019-12-05","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Mattisse Thybulle showing signs of all-around game","content":" Before the season began, I highlighted Philadelphia\u2019s Matisse Thybulle as one of the top rookies to watch due in large part to his potential to shine on defense. The No. 20 pick started the season as a regular rotation player, even starting a few games due to injuries, but saw his playing time dip in early November as he struggled to find his shot. That\u2019s changed over the past few weeks, though, as Thybulle has stepped in for Josh Richardson, who has missed three straight games with a hamstring injury. The Sixers have won four straight and eight of their last nine, and the rookie out of Washington has been a big factor. In those nine games, Thybulle has clearly become more comfortable with his shot, hitting 71.4% of his 3s (10-for-14) while doing his typical work on the defensive end, notching 13 steals in 17.7 minutes off the bench. Coach Brett Brown loves what his rookie is giving him \u2014 on both ends of the floor. \u201cI thought that he played more tame,\u201d Brown said , after Thybulle scored nine points on 3-for-3 shooting on 3-pointers in a win against Utah . \u201cI thought that he took the shots that he should have shot \u2014 under-control shots, his shots. And I thought that he made some defensive plays that were timely. It\u2019s still really interesting for me to see how much ground he covers and getting fingernails on balls and hands on balls.\u201d Thybulle\u2019s ability \u2014 and eagerness \u2014 to challenge opposing team\u2019s best players will keep him on the floor, and he leads all rookies in steals with 1.5 per game , impressive considering his limited minutes. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why we love basketball, just the competitive nature of it,\u201d Thybulle said after helping to hold Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell to 18 points on 6-for-19 shooting. \u201cTo be given the challenge of guarding the other team\u2019s best player is an honor in and of itself, but then also the challenge of it is exciting for me, just as a competitor.\u201d Thybulle\u2019s defense will keep him on the court, but his 3-point shooting \u2014 he\u2019s shooting at a 43.2% clip \u2014 and ability to grow as the season goes on could make Philly a serious contender in the East. \u201cHis shot has surprised me,\u201d Brown said Monday. \u201cAnd I think that the human being, he\u2019s just elite. He\u2019s a great person and he\u2019s a legitimate teammate, a prideful learner. That side of it I think is as important as the athletic side. I think the partnership equals you can expedite improvement quicker, maybe, then with most.\u201d * * * Last week: No. 3 Paschall makes the jump to the top rung as he\u2019s been the most consistent of the bunch lately in the chase for Ja Morant\u2019s spot. In four games this week (all losses), Paschall averaged 18.5 points and 5.5 rebounds on 52.1% shooting. Paschall remains on pace (17.3 ppg) to become the highest-scoring second-round Draft pick in a rookie season, but teammate Draymond Green sees even more in store. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s just scoring off raw talent,\u201d Green said . \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t know how to play the NBA game. As he figures out more and more, how to get fouled, he\u2019ll get better and better.\u201d Last week: No. 2 Nunn is mired in a serious shooting slump, but the Heat are still winning despite his struggles. In four games this week, the breakout guard averaged 10.3 ppg while shooting 29.3% overall (17-for-58) and 14.8% (4-for-27) on 3-poiners. Nunn was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month on Tuesday, but with Morant sidelined, this was his chance to steal the spotlight. Last week: No. 1 Well, it appears Morant\u2019s back injury is more serious than we first thought. Last week , I praised Morant for his ability to fight through injury, but Saturday the team listed him as week-to-week , proving they\u2019re willing to be cautious with their young star. Morant drops in the rankings due to his blank stat line this week, but he should fully return to the Ladder as soon as he steps back on the court. After all, he still leads all rookies in scoring (18.6 ppg) and assists (6.4) and remains the leader in the clubhouse for ROY. Last week: Not ranked Hachimura had a career night Sunday , scoring 30 points on 13-for-23 shooting and grabbing nine rebounds in a 150-125 loss to the Clippers . Hachimura drew praise from both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s a good rookie, a really good rookie,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was great to see him for the first time. We\u2019ve seen a lot of rookies now, but he definitely stood out as one of the better players and one of the best players in the long run, in his class.\u201d Hachimura, whom Leonard called \u201cfundamentally sound\u201d, has struggled through the middle of November but averaged 20.3 ppg in three games this week on 52% shooting. If anyone can make a run at the top players, it\u2019s likely Hachimura as he\u2019ll see plenty of playing time and opportunities for big games. Last week: No. 5 Barrett had the worst game of his career Monday, scoring two points while missing all nine shot attempts in 20 minutes in the Knicks\u2019 132-88 road loss to the Bucks. Barrett chalked it up to the second leg of a back-to-back, but everyone saw the performance as a learning experience. \u201cHe looked like a rookie today,\u2019\u2019 coach David Fizdale said afterward. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to look like. But it\u2019s a good learning lesson for him. I remember days watching Giannis [Antetokounmpo] looking pretty crappy when he was 18, 19. That\u2019s part of the deal for these young guys, going through the lumps of the league.\u201d Terence Davis, Toronto Raptors: The undrafted rookie has scored in double-digits in three of his last five games and has become a key cog off coach Nick Nurse\u2019s bench. His numbers don\u2019t jump off the page, but the Raptors\u2019 gamble on giving Davis a guaranteed contract is looking like a good payoff. With so many rookies putting up big numbers on losing teams, Davis may be one of the few rookies who will actually have an impact for a contender. PJ Washington, Charlotte Hornets: Washington had one of his best games yet on Friday, scoring 26 points on 9-for-12 shooting in a 110-107 win in Detroit. Washington knocked down all three 3-pointers and grabbed five rebounds and a career-best four steals. Jarrett Culver, Minnesota Timberwolves: With a large group of friends and family in Dallas on Wednesday, the Texas Tech product put up 11 points, eight rebounds, 6 assists, 1 steal and 2 blocks in a 121-114 loss . The No. 6 pick has scored in double-digits in six straight games and averaged 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds in his two games this week. Cam Reddish, Atlanta Hawks: With DeAndre Hunter out with a dislocated finger (X-rays were negative), Reddish had one of his best games, scoring a career-high 25 points in the Hawks\u2019 loss to the Nets on Wednesday. The No. 10 pick also grabbed six rebounds and had three steals while going 4-for-7 from beyond the arc. If Hunter misses an extended period of time, this could be Reddish\u2019s chance for increased production. Jaxson Hayes, New Orleans Pelicans: Hayes continues to provide the Pelicans with an energetic rebounder and defender off the bench. In three games this week, Hayes averaged 9.7 points and 7.3 rebounds while adding a steal and a block per game. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 4 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

James finished the game with 20 points, 12 assists and just one turnover, but essentially admitted after the game he should have been rung up for another one. \u201cIt was the worst thing, probably one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever done in my career,\u201d James said, per ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin . \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I did it until halftime. One of my coaches showed me.\u201d James credited his gaffe to being distracted by a collision involving Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell. While checking on that, he said he absent-mindedly shuffled his feet. \u201cI think at the same time, I was watching the underneath play, and KCP and Donovan got into it. KCP started to run, and Donovan bumped into him, he fell on the ground,\u201d James said. \u201cI think I was ready to pass the ball, and my brain just kind of just, I had a malfunction.

The Rockets are 2-3 this season against East teams currently in the (way-too-early) playoff picture.

He grew up in upstate New York, but his family moved north of Boston when he was 12. \u201cIt worked out kind of funny,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m back home and I\u2019m going to coach this game. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d In March of 2018, Craig also coached the Heat when Spoelstra was with wife Nikki for the birth of his first son. The Heat lost that game."},{"id":30207,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-winning-vs-father-time","date":"2019-12-04","title":"LeBron James, set to turn 35 this month, is keeping 'Father Time' at bay","content":" The bearded man in a robe who walks with a slight hunch and carries an hourglass always lurks in the shadows, almost out of view. Nobody is paying him much mind or cares what he has to say \u2014 at least not initially. He\u2019s not on anyone\u2019s radar until he appears and applies a gentle tap on the shoulder (or a violent shove in the back) of the unsuspecting. And that\u2019s when they realize they\u2019ve been paid a visit by someone whom Charles Barkley always says is undefeated . Yes, it is \u201cFather Time,\u201d the mythical creation of the ancient Greeks whose clock is more pronounced than any made in Switzerland. He is, by every metric, always on time, although that seems to vary, depending on his mood. He is gracious and respectful in some cases, unforgiving in others. Ultimately, he and only he decides when your time in sports is up. And so, it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, he\u2019ll throw LeBron James in reverse. But where other stars became role players or transformed into shells of their former selves, LeBron is playing at a high level. He turns 35 later this month and because he\u2019s delivering Kia MVP-quality results here in his 17th NBA season , he is winning against time, and therefore, he is \u2026 cheating time. He\u2019s almost at 57,000 minutes played in the regular season and playoffs combined, which ranks fourth behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant. He should pass Kobe for No. 3 in career scoring (33,643 points) by the All-Star break. The all-time scoring mark and a high ranking on the all-time assists list are in sight, too. Ask him why and how he\u2019s doing it and LeBron is playfully coy and quick to say \u201cfine wine.\u201d He\u2019ll also often credit the extra motivation he acquired last summer, when he watched the playoffs from his sofa, not far removed from a groin injury and a dreadful first season with the Lakers. Those things caused him grief and fueled his desire to reclaim his place. \u201cI put in the work and I trust everything that I\u2019ve done, especially this offseason,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve come in with a great mindset, with a healthy mindset and a healthy body.\u201d Considering his middle age, LeBron is putting together a masterful season ( 25.6 ppg, 7.1 rpg ) while excelling as a volume 3-point shooter . His 10.8 apg leads the NBA and his effort defensively \u2014 which was laughable last season \u2014 is laudable now. Nobody at 35 has assembled such numbers in league history. \u201cHe\u2019s LeBron James,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. \u201cUntil he isn\u2019t.\u201d What\u2019s age got to do with it? Well, nothing right now. LeBron is still capable of unleashing a facial dunk, as he did with a smirk against the Kings\u2019 Nemanja Bjelica , who perhaps wisely never bothered to challenge it. He also covers all the court rather than, as some aging players are wont to do, play between the free throw lines. It\u2019s true that soon enough he will wear longer shorts than anyone in the game \u2014 not from faulty tailoring, but from constant pulling and tugging. And while the ball is in play, he will someday hear squeaking on the court and suddenly notice that sound is coming from his joints. \u201cNobody knows when it\u2019ll happen to him because he\u2019s still playing in the air,\u201d said Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins . \u201cAnd even when that goes, his basketball IQ will allow him to stay great on the ground. I mean, who gets triple doubles at his age? Only he knows when his time is up.\u201d When that day arrives \u2014 and assuming he doesn\u2019t first quit while he\u2019s ahead \u2014 how big of a decline will it be for LeBron (and, by extension, for us) to witness? Will he fall prey to nagging injuries, get torched nightly by previously inferior players, or quit playing defense? Here\u2019s how \u201cFather Time\u201d diminished six greats who came before LeBron: 1. Michael Jordan: When he retired for the second time , after his last season with the Bulls, Jordan was still very much a physical marvel and the reigning MVP and Finals MVP ( he won five MVPs and six Finals MVPs ). He was certifiably great for 13 of his 15 seasons and could\u2019ve been longer if not for three years of college ball, an injury-shortened 1985-86 season and 1 \u00bd missed seasons due to baseball . His body only began to betray him when he un-retired in 2001 to play for the Wizards. At 38, Jordan rarely dunked, wasn\u2019t as sharp defensively and knee issues limited him to 60 games in 2001-02 . 2. Jerry West: \u201cThe Logo\u201d never had a down year in his 14-year career. He was First-Team All-Defense in 1972-73 as a 34-year-old and was solid in his final season (20.3 ppg, 6.6 apg, 2.6 spg). But he wasn\u2019t at his peak of the late 1960s and opted to quit over pride (and money, when Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke refused to renegotiate his contract). 3. Bill Russell: His career ended mainly because he ran out of psychological fuel. Russell lost his passion to play at 35, even after winning championship No. 11 in his final season (1968-69). That season, he played 46.1 mpg in the playoffs, averaging 10.8 ppg, 20.5 rpg and 5.4 apg. While those numbers are perhaps skewed by the way the game was played back then, they\u2019re still remarkable. 4. Wilt Chamberlain: A man of astonishing stats , Chamberlain averaged a league-leading 18.6 rpg and shot 72.7% overall in his final season (1972-73). Knee issues had long forced Wilt into being a statue in the paint and a third option on offense. After that final NBA season, he jumped from the Lakers to the ABA for money. San Diego offered him $600,000 to be a player-coach, but his Lakers contract prevented him from playing. Wilt coached instead, doing so with disinterest , often not showing up for games or practice. He quit basketball completely after that season. 5. Kobe Bryant: Those roundtrip flights to Germany to get oil for his knees managed to delay the obvious for a few years, but a torn Achilles in 2013 at 35 was the killer. Kobe, much like Jordan and LeBron, was elite into his 30s. And he\u2019ll always have that 60-point send-off . 6. Karl Malone: He won his final MVP at 35 and was built for durability, never suffering a serious injury. He averaged 20.6 ppg in his final season with Utah (2002-03) as he approached 40. By then, he had morphed into a jump shooter and lost his instincts for offensive rebounding. He bowed out as a ring-chasing role player with the Lakers in \u201803-04. Larry Bird was ruined by debilitating back issues at 32 . Abdul-Jabbar often only jogged downcourt his last six seasons . Tim Duncan became a secondary option in his last four seasons while Dirk Nowitzki averaged more than 20 ppg once over his final five seasons. Vince Carter is 42 and proudly still playing , but clearly is 10 years beyond his prime. Allen Iverson was the last to know his quickness was gone. \u201cFor me, it was Year 12 when it hit me,\u201d said Lakers great James Worthy , who had knee issues. \u201cMy patented move was taking off from somewhere inside the free throw line. I found myself halfway there once and I started to descend before I got close to the rim. I had to do a George Gervin flip instead of a dunk. \u201cIt\u2019s different now, with this generation of players. I was eating Burger King before games and working out on Nautilus machines. I went to college with Lawrence Taylor and I remember him telling me, \u2018I don\u2019t wanna get hit anymore.\u2019 And he\u2019s a reckless guy. LeBron will wake up one day and he won\u2019t have that drive. He\u2019ll be tired and while physically he\u2019s in such great shape, something will go away, either a move or speed.\u201d LeBron seems determined to be the outlier. He spends, by various estimations, more than $1 million on his body for round the clock therapy and a personal trainer. Last summer, he refused to allow the shooting schedule for the movie \u201cSpace Jam 2\u201d to interfere with his schedule, rising at 3:30 a.m. to train before heading to the set. He has more than once fantasized about staying in the league long enough to possibly play against or alongside his son, Bronny ( now a high school freshman ). \u201cLeBron is not only a great player but a physical marvel,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cProbably the best athlete to ever walk this planet. I\u2019ve never seen anybody in my lifetime in any sport whom I would consider a better athlete. It\u2019s one of his best attributes and the one that goes the least noticed. You just take it for granted that he\u2019s out there every night and still doing his things.\u201d LeBron exchanged playful tweets with Tom Brady last month , with LeBron saying the two are \u201cone in the same.\u201d Brady is a tame comparison to LeBron. Brady doesn\u2019t run 94 feet and back for nine months (playoffs included) and when tired can simply hand off to the running back. Same for NFL legend Joe Montana, who made the Pro Bowl at 37. MLB legend Nolan Ryan threw once every four or five days. Maybe tennis star Roger Federer, who won Wimbledon at 36 and still reaches finals at 38, comes closest. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t shock me if LeBron played until he was 40,\u201d West said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a great athlete and knows enough about his body that he\u2019ll probably leave before he declines.\u201d After watching Robert Parish waste away on the Bulls\u2019 bench, Jordan said he\u2019d never allow himself to stay in the game that long. His pride and unwillingness to be seen as hanging on meant he\u2019d walk away first. LeBron doesn\u2019t think of the twilight and given how he\u2019s playing now, that doesn\u2019t appear to be in the future, anyway. \u201cI was with the Nuggets late in my career and the funny thing is I was leading the league in assists,\u201d said Mark Jackson, fourth on the all-time assists list . \u201cThere was a loose ball, a deflection, and it\u2019s right here, and I can go get it. I made the move to go get it, and before I could get anywhere near it, a kid out of nowhere, and in a blur, snatched it. Gets the ball, by the time I get to the spot where the ball is, he\u2019d already dunked it. Young kid by the name of Allen Iverson. I knew it would never be the same.\u201d Jackson says LeBron is so multi-gifted that he can endure decline in one area and still flourish in another. \u201cHe also has the knowledge, pace and understanding that he\u2019ll still be able to be effective even when he slows down,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be drastic. He can average a triple-double for the next five years.\u201d LeBron is taking great satisfaction in fighting age while tweaking skeptics, both real and imagined, who wondered if decline was imminent. He cites that \u201cWashed King\u201d nickname \u2014 did somebody actually call him that? \u2014 as motivation. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal pressure I put on myself,\u201d LeBron said. Eventually, like everyone, he\u2019ll take the L from \u201cFather Time.\u201d Until then, LeBron is making us wonder if that mythical man exists. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Injuries have held back Phoenix\u2019s Deandre Ayton and Sacramento\u2019s Marvin Bagley, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the Class of \u201918 from being one of the most productive and promising in recent NBA memory. With Graham included, here are seven other standouts at the 2019-20 quarter pole: Luka Doncic , Dallas (No. 3 pick overall): Never mind the \u201csuper sophs\u201d list \u2014 Doncic is getting All-NBA and even Kia MVP consideration for his breathtaking work for the Mavericks. At 30.7 points, 10.3 rebounds and 9.4 assists per game, he\u2019d be a no-brain No. 1 pick if this group were re-drafted. Trae Young , Atlanta (No. 5): The Hawks are fortunate Young has been so dynamic (28.2 ppg, 8.3 apg) and entertaining, sparing them from the second-guessing that normally might have accompanied their decision to swap picks that night with Dallas. Collin Sexton , Cleveland (No. 8): The Alabama product flew below the radar on a losing team last season before landing on the All-Rookie squad and he\u2019s been doing the same this season. His 3-point shooting and assists are down, but Sexton is taking better care of the ball and is up in most categories (18.1 ppg). Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , OKC (No. 11): It\u2019s to SGA\u2019s credit that Thunder GM Sam Presti, so fixated on Draft picks in dealing away Paul George and Russell Westbrook, saw him as a legit piece for OKC\u2019s future. Gilgeous-Alexander has scored at least 20 points nine times , including 26 in his debut and 28 the next game. Jaren Jackson Jr. , Memphis (No. 4): A year ago, Jackson became the first NBA rookie to record at least 50 blocks, 50 steals and 50 3-pointers. This season, he\u2019s back at it, averaging 18.3 ppg in his last 12 games while hitting 43% from the arc. He had 31 points vs. Indiana Monday , picking up slack for injured Ja Morant and Jonas Valunciunas. Wendell Carter Jr. , Chicago (No. 7): Carter has stayed healthy so far and looks like a Bulls building block despite the team\u2019s dreary start . He\u2019s at 12.6 ppg, 9.7 rpg and 56.6% shooting while showing some of the Al Horford similarities for which he was touted in college. Mitchell Robinson , New York (No. 36): Like Graham, Robinson was a second-round gem. His presence is felt most at the rim and on the glass, where his shot-swatting (1.9 bpg), rebounds (6.6) and efficient offense (67.9% shooting) have kept him out of the blame game for the Knicks\u2019 horrible record. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

If you tried to reduce Devonte\u2019 Graham\u2019s path from just last season to this in the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 backcourt, you might come up with something like: Opportunity + confidence = Graham in 2019-20. But it would be sorely lacking, because if you backed up to the start of this decade and factored in every obstacle, hurdle and speed bump faced by Graham since his junior year in high school, the math quickly would get a lot more complex. As in: Opportunity + (growth spurt x Walker\/Parker mentoring)\u00b2 \u2013 4(G League + college snafu\/child Mom-no Dad) \u00f7 confidence = Graham now and presumably into his NBA future. The Hornets combo guard has been one of the surprise stories through the first quarter of this season. His early work off Charlotte\u2019s bench put him in the hopper of potential candidates for Kia Sixth Man of the Year consideration, until his move into the starting lineup shifted Graham to the list of possible Kia Most Improved Player selections. Just Wednesday, he tied the Hornets franchise record with 10 3-pointers against the Warriors. Not bad for a guy who, until a few months ago, might have been best known for the NBA\u2019s most extraneous apostrophe. Graham is one of those overnight successes who has been years in the making. In his case, approximately nine. \u201cHe\u2019s got a confidence about him, and I think that comes when people may not believe in you,\u201d Charlotte coach James Borrego told NBA.com over the weekend. \u201cThey may not think you\u2019re the guy. You\u2019re overlooked, overshadowed. You have to have an inner confidence that allows you to keep pushing forward. \u201cI think that\u2019s been his journey. I appreciate that about him, because I\u2019ve walked a similar journey along the way. You have to build from within \u2014 I refer to it as his swagger. \u2018I am good enough.\u2019 His run in Kansas was a major part of it, a four-year player at a major conference and doing well there. But I don\u2019t think much of the NBA world expected this.\u201d \u201cThis\u201d includes Graham\u2019s production that has eased, on some nights anyway, the loss of both Kemba Walker and Tony Parker from last season\u2019s team: 18.0 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.7 assists, while hitting 39.6% of his 3-pointers. It includes the extra 13.3 points by which Graham\u2019s scoring average has soared compared to 2018-19 (4.7), when he logged 46 games for Charlotte but kept a bag packed for his back-and-forths to G League Greensboro. He tops the NBA so far in scoring bumps, ahead of Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic (plus-9.5), Phoenix\u2019s Aron Baynes (9.1), teammate Terry Rozier (8.3) and last season\u2019s Most Improved winner, Pascal Siakam (8.2). Some of Graham\u2019s increased impact is due to his boost in playing time \u2014 Graham already has played more minutes (737) for the Hornets than he did all of last season (676) \u2014 but not all of it. Per 36, he is at 19.4 points compared to 11.6. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t expect to have this big of a start, this big of a role,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBut sometimes you\u2019ve got to live in the moment and accept it, and keep playing and being aggressive. \u201cI keep saying that it\u2019s opportunity and confidence. Playing time, with putting in the work this summer, my teammates and coaches have a lot of confidence in me. And I do in myself, just coming out and being aggressive.\u201d Graham\u2019s bosses and peers in Charlotte saw his approach last season, after he arrived as a second-round pick (34th overall) from Kansas via a Draft-night trade with Atlanta . They knew he would \u201csponge\u201d on Walker and Parker, learning ways to walk the point guard\u2019s line between creating for teammates and asserting one\u2019s own offense. The way Graham blossomed after stints with the G League Swarm was apparent, too. \u201cHe really embraced the assignment he had to learn under Tony and Kemba \u2014 I think you see parts of their game in Devonte\u2019 this season,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cBut there came a point where he realized, I want to make a mark on this team, on this league. When we sent him to Greensboro, that was really his team to shine and grow. He came back, that\u2019s when I saw the spark of \u2018I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m good enough.\u2019\u201d The spark has been there for a while, long before the Hornets saw it. It was there when Graham was a 5-foot-6 junior at Broughton High in Raleigh, a player whose role for the Garner Road AAU team had been to deliver the basketball to allegedly more promising prospects. They were the ones who would be courted by the glamour schools from the power conferences, or so it seemed. Which was why Graham, after a lone visit to Appalachian State University 190 miles to the West in Boone, N.C., signed the first letter-of-intent anyone offered. It was a decision that soon enough became a problem, but now, in hindsight, might be worthy of some credit in Graham\u2019s trajectory. It was, for instance, his first real taste of security. His mother, Dewanna King, was only 14 years old when Graham was born. Her mother Doris had her hands full raising a young woman while that young woman raised her son, with extended family \u2014 cousins, a nephew with whom they lived for a spell \u2014 all coming through. So Appalachian State and then-coach Jason Capel stepping up for Graham? No way the teenager could say no to that. Trouble was, by his senior year at Broughton, Graham had grown to 6-foot (on the way to his current 6-foot-2). His game and confidence flourished too, such that other, bigger programs now were interested. But Capel, sensitive to being elbowed aside by talent poachers, refused to release Graham from his commitment. \u201cMaybe they had seen something other coaches hadn\u2019t seen,\u201d Graham said, \u201cso maybe they thought they had a diamond in the rough. \u2026 People do things to make them better, and sometimes they might hurt somebody else.\u201d  Graham\u2019s game by then was worthy of a greater stage. The hardball being played over his immediate future trickled to him, too. Choking off his opportunities made Graham, King and some trusted advisers seek out his own, which they found in Brewster Academy, a prep school in Wolfeboro, N.H., familiar to major college coaches. Appalachian State\u2019s insistence made Graham\u2019s choice for him. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter I said I didn\u2019t want to go and they wanted to force me to go. That made me definitely not want to go. I just wanted to re-open my recruitment process.\u201d Graham averaged 17 points at Brewster and with teammate Donovan Mitchell \u2014 yes, that Donovan Mitchell, now of the Utah Jazz \u2014 they led the school to the 2014 national prep championship. But it wasn\u2019t until April, when Capel was fired at Appalachian State and replaced by coach Jim Fox that the Mountaineers released Graham from his letter of intent. \u201cIt was tough, not being able to talk to college coaches,\u201d Graham told NBA.com. \u201cI was out there in New Hampshire in the middle of nowhere, which was a culture shock to me because I had never been out of North Carolina other than AAU. So being away from home and my Mom, some days it was rough.\u201d Finally free, Graham spoke with and narrowed his choices to Virginia, North Carolina State and Kansas. The first didn\u2019t wow him, the second seemed too close to home and the third, well, Kansas coach Bill Self impressed the player and his mother immediately. The Jayhawks had had a roster defection and were in need of a point guard, so the timing was ideal. The fit was, too. Graham teamed in the backcourt with sophomore Frank Mason III (now a two-way player for Milwaukee) and improved each year. As a senior, he averaged 17.3 ppg and 7.2 apg, helping the Jayhawks to the Final Four. In his four years, they went 122-27. Graham already was 23 when he reached the 2018 Draft, but whatever stigma he carried from age or spending four years in college was outweighed by the gains in his game and life. Even Capel has cheered him on from afar, in comments via reporters. Said Graham: \u201cIt [the Appalachian State snag] ended up being maybe the best thing that happened to me. Being held out, going to Brewster, getting better, then ultimately going to Kansas, I feel like that whole situation made me better as a player, as a person.\u201d Graham no longer is a secret or surprise around the league. He gets game-planned for now, often drawing opponents\u2019 best defenders and occasional help. He also has been serving as a nightly reminder of the divergent paths so many players follow, the varied equations, to reach the NBA. Consider Andrew Wiggins, the No. 1 pick in 2014 out of Kansas who missed Graham\u2019s arrival on campus by a few months. Wiggins played just one season for the Jayhawks, lusted after by NBA scouts in 2013-14 just like he\u2019d been by college recruiters as a top prospect out of Canada, born to former pro Mitchell Wiggins. Wiggins was traded for All-Star Kevin Love before he\u2019d ever played a game and spent his first five seasons being scrutinized under the bright lights, earning a label as a low-motor finesse guy. Only this season have things seemed to fully click for Wiggins, his resolve finally catching up to his skills (24.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.5 assists) for a Minnesota team flirting with .500. Graham, by contrast, had been a relative afterthought. Until seizing opportunities with the Hornets again and again \u2013 a 35-point game against Indiana, 9-for-16 3-point shooting vs. the Knicks, a 16-point, 15-assist game against Detroit \u2013 and putting himself in national conversations (tied for second in made 3-pointers with 72). Graham was born on Feb. 22, 1995. Wiggins, on Feb. 23, 1995. Their journeys hardly could be more different. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty in our league,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cYou never know how or when guys are going to get it. Everybody develops at a different rate. Sometimes it\u2019s the environment around you. Sometimes it\u2019s a coach, a player, a system that allows you to get it. But that\u2019s the beauty. You stick with it, you keep developing, you keep going.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

It\u2019s now known as \u201cPulling A Bledsoe\u201d although there are serious doubts if anyone\u2019s brain will actually lock like that again. John Schuhmann :  It\u2019s Luka Doncic\u2019s combination of youth, usage and efficiency. He\u2019s 20 years old and less than 100 games into his NBA career. And not only does he rank third in the league in usage rate , he\u2019s carrying that load for the league\u2019s No. 1 offense . His true shooting percentage (which measures scoring efficiency) ranks fourth among the 39 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher , and his assist\/turnover ratio (2.04) is higher than those of the three guys ahead of him. It\u2019s absolutely legit to think of him as an MVP candidate, and that\u2019s pretty incredible. Sekou Smith :  This is where I think Luka Doncic\u2019s sensational sophomore season takes over the early narrative of this season. He\u2019s on a pace for a historic season for a second-year player and he\u2019s doing it with a blend of physical and mental dominance that belies his years. I don\u2019t think we can put enough stock into how crucial his professional training overseas was in preparing him for what we\u2019re seeing now. If he\u2019s just getting started at 20, it\u2019s frightening for the rest of league when you consider how good he could be in another season or two (when he\u2019s better in every facet of the game). Michael C. Wright :  The season is still young, but I\u2019ve enjoyed watching the whole buildup and return of Carmelo Anthony. This man belongs in the NBA, and it was nice to see him return after more than a year away and win Western Conference Player of the Week just two weeks into his comeback. Having now played six games for the Blazers, Anthony is averaging 17.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 30.7 minutes per game. But more importantly, he\u2019s helping Portland \u2014 which struggled out of the gates \u2014 to win ballgames. In hip-hop, you always hear about your favorite rapper\u2019s favorite rapper. Well, in a way, that\u2019s what Anthony is to NBA players, and it\u2019s heartwarming to see the reception he\u2019s gotten around the league and from his teammates. * * * * * *  Steve Aschburner :  The Knicks. \u2018Nuff said. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019m annoyed by the proposed in-season tournament . While recognizing the need to make the regular season more meaningful if only to appease the TV networks and therefore keep the money flowing, it seems very gimmicky. The best way to put pop in the regular season is to reduce the number of playoff teams, therefore reducing the number of load management games, and perhaps start the season on Christmas Day. John Schuhmann : \u201cAnnoying\u201d isn\u2019t the right word, but it bothers me that Dejounte Murray and Derrick White have played only eight minutes together this season. I think that the explanation is that Murray\u2019s minutes are limited and neither guy spaces the floor for the other. But not much has worked for the Spurs and it\u2019s not like DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge complement each other. The Spurs have tinkered with the starting lineup, but three guys have started every game that they\u2019ve played in and the team has been outscored by 7.3 points per 100 possessions in the 446 minutes those three guys \u2013 Bryn Forbes, DeRozan and Aldridge \u2013 have been on the floor together. When is it time to turn the keys over to (what we thought was) the backcourt of the future? Sekou Smith :  This relentless scrutiny of Kyrie Irving\u2019s every move has subsided recently. But it was bordering on complete foolishness for a few days and threatened so many other stories that should have been in the spotlight. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to litigate Kyrie\u2019s game and reputation when the Nets are much closer to full strength. Dissecting Kyrie\u2019s every word right now, though, is a trivial pursuit I\u2019ll gladly avoid. I\u2019m with Marcus Smart: enough talk about Kyrie with his former teammates and coaches. Everybody else got a chance to start fresh this season, so should Kyrie and the Nets. Michael C. Wright : Load management, and all the hot takes and opinions associated with it. Let\u2019s face it: load management isn\u2019t going away. It\u2019s a part of the modern NBA, and it\u2019s here to stay. I get it, it\u2019s not ideal for the fans paying their hard-earned money to watch their favorite players. But surely those same fans would take a few missed games here and there to see their teams flourish with healthier players. The NBA hasn\u2019t gone soft. It\u2019s just a different game with bigger, faster players and teams now embracing science to ensure their best players can perform optimally for as long as possible. Without load management, we don\u2019t get to enjoy watching Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili perform at such a high level for as long as they did. * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : In theory, I like it. But it needs refining. One thing I\u2019ve heard from a number of coaches is, they do not like losing a timeout when they\u2019ve made a successful challenge. Let them hang onto that when they get it right. I\u2019d like to see fewer replay reviews overall, though, so maybe there are some established \u201ctriggers\u201d that could be dropped \u2013 or just shifted onto the backs of the coach\u2019s challenge option. I know I am tired of four or five players twirling their fingers in the air over almost any call at any time in a game, hoping for a momentum-sapping second-guess. Shaun Powell :  Pull. The. Plug. Can\u2019t yank it quickly enough. But if you must, confine it to just the final four minutes of the game, when every possession counts just a bit more. John Schuhmann :  Pull the plug , or at least limit it to the last five minutes of the game. The coaches don\u2019t appear to like it (even when it works for them) and there\u2019s just too much review time in certain games. The clear path rule needs to go too. (Just give the offense two shots and the ball for any intentional foul in the first 12 seconds of the shot clock.)  Sekou Smith :  I remain a huge proponent for the continued evolution of the game, in any way that seems reasonable. So I say continue it. The coaches are making their adjustments to the change and how to manage it. I realize most of the coaches seem ready to scrap the whole thing, but give it time, fellas. As the season progresses, we\u2019ll have a better idea of how the challenge impacts the game and whether or not it\u2019s working for the greater good. Michael C. Wright :  Let\u2019s continue it because, to me, it adds another strategic layer to the game that coaches are still trying to get a handle on, and ultimately the goal of the challenge in a way is to ensure fairness in competition. That can only be viewed as a positive. The early returns from challenges haven\u2019t yielded terribly high success rates so far, but coaches will find a better feel for it once there\u2019s a larger sample size from which to draw data. The fact that you get only one challenge is what makes this intriguing. * * *"},{"id":30251,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-top-teams-biggest-surprise-disappointment","date":"2019-12-04","title":"Blogtable: Best team? Biggest surprise? Biggest disappointment?","content":" IN THIS BLOGTABLE:  Top 5 teams? | Biggest surprise of season? | Biggest disappointment? * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : The Bucks have played a tougher schedule than most of the top contenders, weathered Khris Middleton\u2019s injury without a hiccup and are thriving with continuity and depth. My Top 5:  1. Milwaukee. 2. L.A. Lakers. 3. LA Clippers. 4. Toronto. 5. Boston. Shaun Powell :  No. 1 is the Bucks. Greatest point differential, a superstar in Giannis, quality wins vs. the Rockets, Raptors, Clippers and Pacers and consecutive blowouts by 40-plus points . Lost one game by three points and another in overtime . No. 2 is the Clippers. Didn\u2019t have Paul George for 11 games and Kawhi Leonard for six and still lurk in the attic of the West. They\u2019re just getting started. No. 3 is the Lakers. Ripped through a record month (albeit against a batch of inferior teams) and LeBron James and Anthony Davis are both playing at a Kia MVP level . No. 4 is the Raptors. The heart of a champion beats without Kawhi and while missing Serge Ibaka and Kyle Lowry for chunks of games. Pascal Siakam is for real , folks. No. 5 is the Celtics. Currently playing through the loss of Gordon Hayward, who had just started to sparkle before his injury, and own a convincing win over the Bucks. Sorry, Nuggets \u2026 you just missed the cut. John Schuhmann : I typically only rank teams on Mondays , but I\u2019ll make this exception \u2026 No. 1 is Milwaukee. Their 12-game winning streak lacks a signature win, but they\u2019re 16-1 since Nov. 1 with only a three-point loss in Utah. No. 2 is the L.A. Lakers. They have played a relatively weak schedule as well, but it\u2019s hard to argue with 18-3, with how well they\u2019ve been able to close games out, or how good they\u2019ve been defensively . No. 3 is the LA Clippers. They haven\u2019t been as consistent as the teams above, but last week\u2019s win in Dallas was a display of just how good they can be, especially defensively. No. 4 is the Dallas Mavericks. That loss to the Clippers is the only setback in an 8-1 stretch in which they\u2019ve beat the Raptors and Lakers ( in L.A. ). No. 5 is the Toronto Raptors. They\u2019re the only team without a loss that wasn\u2019t within five points in the last five minutes, but now are just 3-5 against the other 12 teams that are currently over .500. Sekou Smith :  I\u2019m going with the Bucks (No. 1), Lakers (No. 2), Clippers (No. 3), Raptors (No. 4) and the Nuggets (No. 5) edging out the Celtics. The Bucks ran through the competition with their second-best player missing and Giannis Antetokounmpo destroying everything in sight. The Lakers are off to a championship start and playing at an elite level on both ends of the floor. The Clippers have the league\u2019s best bench and the best perimeter defensive personnel we\u2019ve seen in years. The Raptors are still in a championship groove even without Kawhi Leonard. They\u2019ve been the most impressive team given the circumstances. The Nuggets got off to a slow start but I believe in what coach Mike Malone has built. Losing Gordon Hayward was yet another cruel injury blow for the Celtics but they remain the most dangerous group outside of the obvious top five teams. Michael C. Wright :  My Top 5: 1. Lakers 2. Bucks 3. Clippers 4. Raptors 5. Rockets. I was w affling some on No. 5 between the Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks and the Houston Rockets, but the Rockets get the nod here simply because the franchise is so desperate, knowing the championship window is closing quickly. The Lakers hold the top spot for me, and it\u2019ll be revealing to see how they hold up playing such a brutal schedule this month . Milwaukee is hot right now at No. 2, but it isn\u2019t defending the 3-point line the way it needs to at this point. The Clippers and Raptors hold the next two spots at Nos. 3 and 4. The Clippers\u2019 defense is nasty, they\u2019re battle-tested and deep. But the Raptors are getting it done on both ends of the floor (Top 5 in offensive and defensive rating).  * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : That the Toronto Raptors haven\u2019t curled up in the fetal position that so many expected of them. Maybe playing those 22 load management games without Kawhi Leonard \u2014 along with the experience so many of their players gained in The Finals run \u2014 did wonders for what was considered a supporting cast.  Shaun Powell :  Luka Doncic already being in the Kia MVP conversation means he\u2019s wearing skates on his path to development. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be merely an All-Star first? Him taking the baton from Dirk Nowitzki could be similar to Tim Duncan taking it from David Robinson . Or is that basketball sacrilege? Not sure if it is. Luka is that good, that quickly. Doing it nightly means you\u2019re no fluke. John Schuhmann :  The Indiana Pacers winning 13 of their first 20 games is a surprise. They\u2019ve played a very easy schedule and have just one win over a team that\u2019s currently over .500. But good teams take care of business against the teams at the bottom of the standings, and they\u2019ve been better than they were without Victor Oladipo last season. Malcolm Brogdon has been great, but the Pacers were without Myles Turner for eight games , they lost six guys from their rotation last season, and they had a rough first week, losing to Detroit (twice) and Cleveland. I wasn\u2019t sure they were a playoff team if they weren\u2019t going to get Oladipo back early in the season, but they\u2019re clearly that and maybe more. Sekou Smith :  As surprising as Luka Doncic\u2019s breakout season has been, I\u2019m more surprised at how well Pascal Siakam and the Toronto Raptors have performed in the aftermath of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s departure. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from him or them. But it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re more than just one-hit wonders. Siakam has elevated his game in ways I didn\u2019t imagine would be possible until he went bonkers in the 2019 Finals . Now, I don\u2019t know what his ceiling might be. And kudos to coach Nick Nurse and his staff for keeping it going, even without the services of some of his veteran stars this season . Michael C. Wright :  If this question was asked a couple weeks ago, Phoenix\u2019s rise would\u2019ve been the surprise for me. The Suns started off 7-4, then dropped six of the next seven. So, let\u2019s go with the Miami Heat here. They\u2019re legit. Back in the summer when Miami signed Jimmy Butler, nobody around the league expected him to make this significant of an impact. But here he is, a playmaker, at age 30, averaging a career-best 6.7 assists as youngsters such as Bam Adebayo and Kendrick Nunn (a Kia NBA Rookie of the Year candidate) blossom around him along with Tyler Herro. Butler brings an intensity and competitiveness that will be locked into this young squad\u2019s DNA for a while, thus setting up the Heat for a bright future with all these young, budding stars. * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : This was the season \u2014 finally! \u2014 that the Chicago Bulls were going to actually try to win some games. Two years of tanking, er, rebuilding was supposed to pay off in a roster full of young talent, assisted in 2019-20 by some carefully selected vets (Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky). But neither Zach LaVine nor Lauri Markkanen has taken the big step up expected of him, injuries on the wing (Otto Porter Jr., Chandler Hutchison) have intruded and there\u2019s still too much tension surrounding coach Jim Boylen and his acceptance by the players. The Bulls have face-planted so far. Shaun Powell :  There are nights when the Spurs aren\u2019t even competitive. The last time anyone said that about a Gregg Popovich team was right before this epic two-plus decade run started, when David Robinson was hurt and the Spurs collapsed their way to the Draft lottery and the No. 1 pick \u2014 and you know how that went. They\u2019ve lost to the Pistons by 34 , the Celtics by 20 , the Wolves twice by double digits . And they\u2019re relatively healthy, too. John Schuhmann :  We\u2019re going on seven weeks without Zion Williamson , and the disappointment is as much about the impact that he could be making on the Western Conference playoff race as it is about the highlights. The big takeaway from the preseason was that the most-hyped No. 1 pick in a long time was ready to make a real impact on the Pelicans right away. There\u2019s still plenty of season left, but a knee injury at this point in his career is a scary proposition and the Pelicans should obviously take all precautions going forward. Hopefully, when we\u2019re looking back five years from now, this delayed start was just a blip on the radar. Sekou Smith :  They might be in the midst of turning things around right now with the aid of Carmelo Anthony, but I expected so much more from the Portland Trail Blazers. That trip to the 2019 Western Conference finals was supposed to be the start of something special. And instead, it felt (early on this season) like the Blazers had exhaled and maybe settled for a fate that would not include any sustained contention in a brutal West playoff chase. Anthony has a chance to resurrect his image and career this season \u2014 and he might just help save the season in Portland, too. Michael C. Wright :  There are plenty: Golden State\u2019s demise, the Zion Williamson injury, and the struggles of the Sacramento Kings. But the biggest for me is what\u2019s going on in San Antonio. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry once joked that for the last 20 years people have been trying to slam shut the Spurs\u2019 championship window. It\u2019s closed now, it appears, and San Antonio likely won\u2019t extend its playoff streak to 23 years in a row. That\u2019s confounding considering the Spurs should actually be in better shape than they were a year ago given the return of Dejounte Murray, DeMar DeRozan getting comfortable in his second season there and Derrick White\u2019s ascension (not to mention the expected emergence of Lonnie Walker IV). The Spurs produced their worst defensive season in 22 years last season, and 2019-20 so far is shaping up to be even worse. You have to wonder how much more of this Gregg Popovich can take. * * *"},{"id":30257,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-best-player-best-duo-best-offseason-move","date":"2019-12-04","title":"Blogtable: Best player? Best duo? Best offseason move?","content":"IN THIS BLOGTABLE:  Best player in NBA so far? | Best duo in NBA? | Offseason\u2019s best acquisition? * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : Giannis Antetokounmpo. The reigning MVP has gotten better or more productive in pretty much every category, and his willingness to hoist 3-pointers is more important at this point than his 30.4% success rate. Meanwhile, his leadership, spoken and unspoken, is unsurpassed. I get the craving for variety that voters for the major awards often feel, but intentionally looking for an alternative MVP \u2014 even at this early stage \u2014 strikes me as a mistake. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo, but it\u2019s also closer than you might think. He remains a handful each night and seems to take great pride in being the best player on the floor at all times. Still, by the All-Star break, he\u2019ll be overtaken by Luka Doncic if the youngster keeps this up. And if we\u2019re grading this on the best player based on age, then obviously it\u2019s LeBron here on the verge of turning 35. John Schuhmann :  Giannis Antetokounmpo. He\u2019s the driving force on both ends of the floor for a team that ranks in the top two in both offensive and defensive efficiency. His jumper remains a weakness, but keeping him away from the basket remains impossible; His 18.7 points in the paint per game are up from 17.5 last season , which was the most since Shaquille O\u2019Neal in 2002-03 . He plays every night and he doesn\u2019t take possessions off.  Sekou Smith :  Giannis Antetokounmpo has been every bit as unstoppable to date this season as he was all last season , a remarkable thing to see from a young player with so much room to improve certain aspects of his game. The fact that he\u2019s as good as he is on both ends of the floor only serves to cement his claim to the top spot. There\u2019s a robust crowd on his heels (LeBron, Harden, Luka and more) but I\u2019ve got \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d out front. Michael C. Wright :  As eye-popping as his performances have been this season, it\u2019s still too early for me to put Luka Doncic in this conversation, as I\u2019d like to see more. And you\u2019ve got to show some love for what \u2018Washed King\u2019 LeBron James is doing. But let\u2019s give Giannis Antetokounmpo his due here. The man is following up his Kia MVP season with a higher usage rate, and a better player-efficiency rating, while averaging more points and rebounds. You can also see that Antetokounmpo is trying to expand his game, taking nearly five 3-point attempts (4.9) per game after averaging 2.8 in his MVP season. * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The sample size for Kawhi Leonard and Paul George down the hall at Staples Center is too small. Besides, I\u2019m more a fan of complementary players than I am of matched sets. It\u2019s been interesting to see James defer to and serve another superstar\u2019s game the way he has so far (while still serving his own game just fine). Shaun Powell :  LeBron James and Anthony Davis are the new Shaq and Kobe in L.A. , a pair of generational players doing a tag-team number most nights. They\u2019re taking turns throwing haymakers at the opposition and becoming tough to contain. Basically, they\u2019ve been just as advertised and obviously the main reason the Lakers are looking down at the rest of the West in the standings . John Schuhmann :  That LeBron James and Anthony Davis have been the best duo so far is not a surprise , especially because Paul George and Kawhi Leonard have played in only seven games together. What is somewhat surprising is that James and Davis have been as much of a force defensively as they have offensively. James has been more active on that end of the floor than he\u2019s been over the last few years and Davis has been fulfilling his potential as a Kia Defensive Player of the Year candidate. The Lakers have allowed less than a point per possession with their two stars on the floor, and building those defensive habits early on will pay off come April and May.  Sekou Smith :  As good as LeBron and Anthony Davis have been together and could potentially be, the sight of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George teaming up on both ends for the Clippers has me wondering how crazy an all-L.A. playoff series would. Daydreaming aside, the length, athleticism and versatility of the Clippers\u2019 duo just feels like it has more mileage you can get out of them long-term. Longevity, and the health status of both guys, are the only things that give me cause for pause. Michael C. Wright :  I\u2019m really excited to see Jrue Holliday and Zion Williamson or Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry, but right now, the best duo for me is Kawhi Leonard and Paul George . This duo just combined for 65 points in a win over the Wizards, and in Leonard and George you\u2019ve got a pair of dogs that are not just bona fide closers, but defensive stoppers. The Clippers have scored 150 points twice this season, and what\u2019s scary is that coach Doc Rivers said before Sunday\u2019s game that Leonard and George haven\u2019t even yet practiced together in the same lineup. * * * * * * Steve Aschburner : Well, we all know that Carmelo Anthony is the best acquisition of the early season \u2026 so I\u2019m sticking with Anthony Davis. Look, I loathed the disruption that he and his reps caused not just for the Pelicans but for the entire NBA last winter. I would have preferred he languish another season in New Orleans and learn to act like a professional before moving only in free agency. But there is no denying that what they tried to force then has proven to be a insta-contender now. Shaun Powell :  If we\u2019re talking about a singular player, then Anthony Davis is the answer if only because the Lakers are winning big because of him. But remember, Kawhi Leonard came with Paul George attached. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the team that\u2019s done the most under the radar with its additions: Indiana, with Malcolm Brogdon, TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb all doing well and holding it down until Victor Oladipo suits up. John Schuhmann : It\u2019s not clearly anybody. It\u2019s either Anthony Davis or Kawhi Leonard, but it\u2019s too early to make that determination. Leonard brought Paul George with him, but his efficiency is way down from last season , the Clippers are still in the early stages, and Davis gets similar points for helping LeBron James become more engaged defensively.  Sekou Smith :  Kawhi Leonard (with Paul George, too). This is potentially the sort of game-changer in the vein of the 2007-08 Celtics (when Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen joined Paul Pierce), the 2010-11 Heat (when LeBron James and Chris Bosh joined Dwyane Wade) and the 2016-17 Warriors (when Kevin Durant joined Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson). If the Clippers turn this combo into just one championship, it\u2019ll be worth whatever price the Clippers paid to make it happen. Michael C. Wright :  Kawhi Leonard, easily. The man has won a championship every team he\u2019s been on, and there\u2019s a good chance he grabs another title with team No. 3. Leonard has low-key improved a facet of his game nearly every year he\u2019s been in the league. The lockdown defense is a given, but Leonard has really made strides as a playmaker over the past couple of seasons. He\u2019s currently averaging career-highs in assists (5.3) and rebounds (7.9) , and he leads in a quiet, hardworking way that inspires others to match his work ethic. * * *"},{"id":30234,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/things-know-nba-dec-4","date":"2019-12-04","title":"6 NBA things to know for Dec. 4","content":" 1. Bucks target lucky No. 13: Quick: name your favorite Bucks player from the 1973-74 season . Can\u2019t think of one? That\u2019s understandable, but know that was the last time Milwaukee was cooking winning streak-wise like it is these days. The Bucks hit the road tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ) in search of their 13th straight win and if they get it, they\u2019d tie the \u201973-74 team (which went on to lose 4-3 in The Finals to Boston). Additionally, if they can manage to beat the Pistons by 40 or more points tonight, they\u2019d become the first team to win three straight games by 40 or more points. 2. Next steps from Harden\u2019s dunk?:  The Rockets-Spurs game on Tuesday may go down as one of the season\u2019s most memorable games. Even if it doesn\u2019t it will undoubtedly linger in Houston\u2019s mind for a while. James Harden had a dunk with 7 minutes, 50 seconds disallowed in a 135-133 double-overtime loss that had the NBA world abuzz last night and into today. Who knows what will happen next, but the storyline will surely live on for at least a few more days. 3. Miami can play spoiler (again) :  The Raptors got a front row seat for the Jimmy Butler show last night as the Heat star piled up a triple-double en route to Miami\u2019s 121-110 overtime win . That victory halted Toronto\u2019s 10-0 start at home and Miami gets a shot at blemishing Boston\u2019s 7-0 home mark next ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). This one could get exciting if it gets into a clutch situation: the Celtics have the No. 1-rated offense in clutch scenarios , while the Heat are tied for 9th in clutch defense . 4. Jazz out of tune lately:  Utah was fancied \u2014 by itself and outsiders \u2014 as a Western Conference contender this season. While the Jazz aren\u2019t exactly lottery-bound, they aren\u2019t lighting the NBA on fire lately with their play. A showdown with the West-leading Lakers looms ( 9 ET, NBA TV ) after Utah\u2019s road-heavy November and a win tonight could get it on the right track. Easier said than done, though, of course. Since starting the season 4-1, Utah ranks 22nd in Offensive Rating and 13th in Defensive Rating \u2014 both of which are well worse than last season\u2019s finish ( 14th Off. Rtg; 2nd Def. Rtg ). 5. When Steph joined the 2K club\u2026:  Given the injury pile-up on the current roster, fond memories of the past are just about all Warriors fans have to think about these days. In an effort to keep the spirits high in the Bay, we remind Warriors fans that on this date two years ago, Stephen Curry became the fastest player to reach 2,000 career 3-pointers . He accomplished the feat against the Pelicans in what was his 597th career game, surpassing Ray Allen\u2019s 824 career games. 6. Happy 63rd birthday, Bernard King!:  One of the most explosive scorers of his era, Hall of Famer Bernard King had a fascinating career. At the peak of his abilities, he suffered a major knee injury yet returned to the court against great odds and remained an effective scorer.

But the force of that dunk and the fickle net flung the ball back upwards in a blur of leather and twine, leading many observers \u2014 including the officials \u2014 to believe that Harden\u2019s dunk had in fact caromed out. In what wound up being a 135-133 double-overtime win for the San Antonio Spurs, that moment of confusion made all the difference to the Houston Rockets. \u201cThey said that the ball hit James and went back through [the hoop], so it was goaltending on James, so I said, \u2018I challenge that,\u2019 \u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said to reporters, before the NBA\u2019s pool report was released. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a response. Another guy said that it wasn\u2019t goaltending, it just went out of bounds on us. I said, \u2018Well, I challenge that.\u2019 They go, \u2018Can\u2019t do that.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t get an explanation. I got nothin\u2019.\u201d Crew chief James Capers said that upon reviewing the video after the game, the dunk should have counted. He added, however, that D\u2019Antoni\u2019s request for a review came too late. \u201cIt is a reviewable matter, but you have a window of 30 seconds to challenge the play during the timeout that he had,\u201d Capers said. \u201cWhile they were protesting the call, trying to get clarification of it, that window passed. So therefore it elapsed and they were not able to do it.\u201d Per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon, the Rockets are reportedly optimistic the NBA will either award them the win due to Houston outscoring San Antonio in regulation or that it will order the final 7 minutes, 50 seconds of the game to be replayed at a later date. The botched call seemed to crush Houston\u2019s momentum. The sequence, which occurred with just under eight minutes left in the fourth quarter, became part of a Spurs rally from 22 points down. Harden finished with 50 points three nights after scoring 60 in a win over against the Atlanta Hawks, but was also called for a charging foul on his potential game-winning drive with 0.8 left in the second overtime. Houston outscored San Antonio 7-2 in the final two minutes of overtime to force a second OT. Harden\u2019s runner bounded off the backboard and rim as the first overtime ended. With the loss, the Rockets fall to 13-7 and now sit in fifth place in the Western Conference. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":30233,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/draymond-green-jersey-retired-michigan-state","date":"2019-12-04","title":"Warriors' Draymond Green has No. 23 retired by Michigan State","content":" SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green #23 was retired by Michigan State University men\u2019s basketball program during a ceremony in East Lansing, Mich., earlier tonight.

Those evaluations are being processed as we head into the meat of this week\u2019s schedule and will be reflected in the Dec. 6 edition of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Anyone wondering about the sustainability of a hot start to this season from youngsters like Luka Doncic or Pascal Siakam have had their lingering questions answered. The absence of injured superstars who would normally occupy space in the Kia MVP conversation \u2014 namely Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry \u2014 has no doubt created an opening for some of these new faces. But that doesn\u2019t mean these young upstarts wouldn\u2019t have played their way into the mix anyway. The best since MJ?: James Harden is making a compelling case that he is indeed the greatest scoring machine the league has seen since Michael Jordan. That is a remarkable statement in an era with Durant and Curry establishing themselves as two of the all-time greats as well. Harden is on track for his third straight scoring title and would join MJ and KD on the list of players to ever do that. Player(s) of the week: Giannis Antetokounmpo won the honor for the Eastern Conference, which shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. But for Carmelo Anthony to snag the honor for the Western Conference is truly special. Out of the league for the past year, Anthony has returned with a vengeance in Portland. But Anthony is exuding a much more mature vibe rather than the sort of traditional chip on the shoulder we\u2019re used to in these scenarios. His humbling year away from the league seems to have focused him in a way that might have been missing in his stops in Oklahoma City and Houston. The Blazers were obviously a great fit and kudos to the folks in Portland for taking the chance on the future Hall of Famer that so many were not willing to take. Now, let\u2019s get into your comments about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Rosemary Filou Nov. 29, 2019 | 11:18 a.m. \ufeff Kemba Walker should not be 3rd. Just because his team has a good record doesn\u2019t mean he is better than other players. Bradley Beal is not in the top 15 players on the MVP ladder and he is averaging roughly six points and two assists more than Kemba and roughly the same amount of rebounds (Beal, 4.3 rpg; Walker, 4.7 rpg). Just because the Wizards are not a good team doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have good players. In my opinion, the MVP ladder should be\u2026 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. James Harden 5. Anthony Davis 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Bradley Beal 8. Kemba Walker 9. Pascal Siakam 10. Karl-Anthony Towns I hope that this e-mail changes your view of the MVP ladder. * * * My response: Thank you, Rosemary, for the message, but your email doesn\u2019t change my view. If we\u2019re just going with raw numbers absent of any context we can just sit and stare at this all day and save ourselves a whole lot of time. Your advocacy for Bradley Beal or any other player putting up monster numbers on a losing team are well noted. But that argument should be made come All-Star or even All-NBA voting time, not here. From:  Giorgos Nov. 29, 2019 |  4:47 p.m. Dear Mr. MVP Ladder evaluator, I really like your way of analyzing who and why is on the top 5 spots of the ladder every week, and independently if I agree or not, you pose solid arguments behind that. My two pennies: 1.  At the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter who is No. 4 or No. 5. I am 35 years old and I hardly can remember any year that the MVP award didn\u2019t go to one of the top-three front runners. 2. Why Giannis is the MVP? No numbers matter but this: he is the only player in NBA history who will elevate another teammate to an All-Star level, a teammate who \u2014 in normal conditions and without Giannis on the team \u2014 would not even be a borderline All-Star. This achievement might be even more tremendous if that player is not named \u201cKhris Middleton\u201d this year * * * My response: So formal, Giorgos. Your manners are impeccable (\u201cMr. MVP Ladder evaluator\u201d has a nice ring to it). Your point is well stated. I\u2019m sure there are a few players, past and present, that would love to debate you about Giannis being the \u201conly player in NBA history who will elevate another teammate to an All-Star level.\u201d That\u2019s a little rich, even for this forum. Again, your underlying point is spot on. Thanks for the pennies. From:  Noah James Nov. 29, 2019 | 9:23 p.m. \ufeff Luka should be higher than Lebron. Luka straight up I believe has better stats than LeBron, and Luka has a better impact on the floor. In the Mavs\u2019 loss to the Clippers, when Luka was off the floor the team couldn\u2019t go anywhere. The Mavs need Luka more than the Lakers need LeBron. When LeBron is missing his shots, Anthony Davis backs him up. I love Kristaps Porzingis and all, but I can\u2019t really say that about him. Luka makes a lot of plays for him and sets him up. Plus, Luka is averaging almost a triple-double while averaging almost 30 ppg is nearly historic. Russell Westbrook wanted the win, but he stat hunted and Steven Adams gave him boards. Without Adams, he is not averaging a triple-double. Luka is doing more stuff for his team than LeBron is doing. He is more valuable the LeBron and should be at least in second place. Sent from Noah Age:12 * * * My response: Congratulations Noah, you just had to rub it in, didn\u2019t you? The rest of us know we\u2019re ancient (I remember 12 like a black and white silent movie). Your belief that Luka does more for his team than LeBron does for his team makes sense when you consider there is no one the caliber of Anthony Davis on that Dallas roster. Both LeBron and Luka carry a huge load for their respective teams, that much we can agree on. That\u2019s always a good place to start. From:  Patrick Moran Dec. 1, 2019 | 2:57 a.m. Hey Sekou! Big fan here and hoping I could get a clarification for the recent MVP ladder that was posted. Just want to know if you actually spend time watching the NBA at all? I think you\u2019d find it would help when putting compiling the next MVP Ladder. Let me know if I can be of any help. Cheers! * * * My response:  Cheers to you as well, Pat. And, yes, I watch as much as is humanly possible. That said, it\u2019s good to know you\u2019ll be there in my time of need. From:  Akhila Vila Nov. 30, 2019 | 11:54 p.m. I realize you seem to value winning over anything else, but Boston is only 13-5, with only a marginally better SRS than the Rockets in a much weaker conference. Harden\u2019s leading the 2nd best offense in the NBA with two starters injured in Green and Gordon, not to mention with co-superstar Russell Westbrook shooting a career-worst 22.5% from 3-point range. E very advanced stat in existence has Harden as a much better player (PIPM, RAPTOR, BPM, WS\/48, VORP, PER, TPA, you name it). I could see a semblance of an argument if Kemba were anything close to a lockdown defender, but neither player is a positive defensively and it\u2019s not even close on offense \u2014 Harden\u2019s lapping Kemba in scoring, efficiency, and assists, while leading an offense that\u2019s ranked 10 positions higher. I apologize for my harsh words, but I honestly feel that this is an affront to NBA reporting, and an insult to everything Harden\u2019s doing to keep the Rockets competitive in an excruciatingly tight Western Conference (not to mention an insult to great seasons across the board from Tatum, Brown, Hayward, Smart, and the rest of a gritty, tough Celtics team, to insinuate that the majority of their success comes down to Kemba).  * * * My response:  It\u2019s not that I value winning over anything else, Akhila. Winning is one way to separate players having great (statistical) seasons. The difference in measurables for players who are at the top of the league in any statistical category often comes down to the context they are being viewed in. If advanced statistics is your main measure, then we will certainly have major differences in opinion. They play a part for me, but are not the deciding factor when it comes to how I determine who goes where on the Ladder in a given week. From:  David Mirc Nov. 30, 2019 | 1:19 a.m. First of all, I really enjoy your weekly MVP ladders so keep up with the good work. However, it is really hard for me to agree with Kemba Walker being above Luka Don\u010di\u010d in the MVP race. The Celtics are 13-5 in an easier Eastern Conference, while Dallas Mavericks are 11-6 (I don\u2019t count the Suns game here tonight, where Luka torched them again), so record-wise they are on a similar level. Kemba has a slightly better supporting cast in my opinion until Porzingis gets to full flight in Dallas. If we look at sheer head-to-head stats , it\u2019s not even close: Doncic is averaging approximately 30 ppg, 10 rpg and 10 apg on 30-10-10 on 48% shooting, while Walker is at approximately 22 ppg, 5 rpg and 5 apg on 41% shooting. No amount of defense (which Luka improved drastically in the past few games and still a long way to go though) can negate the absolute Grand Canyon of a statistical gap between these two players. Looking forward to your counter-argument, as I can\u2019t really find one. P.S.: I understand numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, but the difference here is just mind-boggling. * * * My response: Thanks for reading, David. And I\u2019m glad you know that numbers alone don\u2019t tell the whole story. The numbers, however, do tell a compelling story about the work Luka is doing in Dallas. What the Mavericks ask of Luka is obviously different from what the Celtics ask of Kemba, which makes comparing their raw numbers straight up just a bit more challenging. Different, sure. But mind-boggling? Eh, I\u2019m not sure I agree with that characterization. From:  Nick Kopke Nov. 30, 2019 | 6:36 p.m. \ufeff Giannis Is an outstanding, dominant player. But let\u2019s not forget he was exposed in the playoffs and Kawhi Leonard should\u2019ve been the MVP last season. Keeping him up in the No. 1 spot despite the seasons LeBron James and Luka Doncic are delivering is, to me, irresponsible and it does not give justice to the top players in the league. L uka Is playing better than anybody in the league right now \u2014 you can\u2019t argue that and there is no disputing it. Putting Walker above him in the No. 3 spot just makes it look like you have some type of an agenda you are attempting to promote. * * * My response: No agendas here, Nick. There\u2019s no need. The NBA is the greatest reality show there is and it comes without a script. These players write it and rewrite it time after time over the course of a long and grueling season. Kawhi Leonard was the MVP last season \u2026 in The Finals, an honor he earned the hard way. Giannis did the same for the regular season version of the award. I\u2019ll let you and everyone else decide which one is more impressive. From:  Milos Visnjic Dec. 1, 2019 | 1:06 a.m. Dude, You are on something. Kemba Walker in the top 5? Doncic at No. 4 while averaging a near 30-point triple-double at 20 years old in his second season? No mention of James Harden? You are just either craving to get attention or plain stupid in your rationale when making your picks. Remember, basketball is a team sport so please for goodness sakes don\u2019t judge the player ranking on team performance ever!!! If that was true, Bill Russell is then greatest of all time. Which we both know as great as he was (undeniably), he is just not GOAT. Stop the lunacy, homie, and go based on numbers like anyone else does in business. * * * My response: Milos, oh Milos. Perhaps you didn\u2019t see the sign above the front door. This is the All-Natural Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, my good man. Now that I\u2019ve read and reread your email \u2026 dude, I\u2019m confused. You want me to \u201cremember that basketball is a team sport\u201d but don\u2019t judge the player rankings off of team performance? I\u2019ve got a novel idea for you that doesn\u2019t involve any insults. You can use whatever factors you want to in crafting your list and I\u2019ll stick to mine. We can just politely agree to disagree. * * * From:   Eliezer Garcia Nov. 29, 2019 | 1:55 p. m. Why do you rank LBJ above AD? AD only trails in assists and in all other metrics he has been better. I think No. 9 is too low considering his stats are very similar to LBJ, who is at No. 2 * * * My response: The dilemma with ranking two teammates on the list is weighing the contributions of both guys and deciding whose impact is greater on the team\u2019s bottom line. LeBron\u2019s role for the Lakers is more significant to me. And that\u2019s with a healthy appreciation for just how great AD is playing for them this season. From:   Javi Dent Nov. 29, 2019 | 3:01 p.m. Make the Ladder make sense. Take Harden off the roster and they \u2019 re a 12 seed. * * * My response: A 12 seed? Come on now. You don\u2019t think Russell Westbrook could serve as the catalyst for that Rockets team and have them in the playoff mix? From:  Max Steves Dec. 1, 2019 | 12:04 a.m. How can an outstanding offensive player be MVP just for the above abilities? Harden cannot get his own shot! Does not (see) pass often to other players? That is not an all-around MVP! * * * My response: The notion that James Harden can\u2019t get his own shot is patently false, as his many victims around the league can attest. If your argument is that he shouldn\u2019t be considered because he\u2019s a lousy defender, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of folks would agree with you. But getting his own shot is the one thing Harden does better than anyone in the league. From:   Daniel Fripp Dec. 1, 2019 | 6:25 p.m. Is Luka good for No. 1 this week on the MVP ladder? Do it for your fans Sekou! * * * My response: Could be. Come back Friday and find out. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

East powers collide in Toronto: A must-see showdown in Canada looms ( League Pass, 7:30 ET ) as Miami and Toronto \u2014 both among the league\u2019s top 10 in net rating, assist percentage and true shooting percentage \u2014 square off. The Heat have one of the East\u2019s tougher December schedules and need a win tonight to prove their case as a contender. As for the Raptors, they\u2019ve won seven straight but play five of their next six games (including this one) against teams .500 or better. 2. A West showdown in Denver: The Lakers took the NBA by storm in November, racking up 10 straight wins (against a schedule that, in retrospect, was pretty thin on contenders). The Nuggets were also hot last month, going 10-2 by logging wins against the Rockets, Sixers, Heat and Celtics during that stretch. An early-December meeting ( 9 ET, League Pass ) should go a long way in sussing out which team could reign supreme in the West. And, of course, there\u2019s a great big man matchup (Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic vs. the Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis) to dig into as well. 3. Luka-mania rolls along:  Oh, if only Zion Williamson were healthy for this one ( 7:30 ET, TNT ). You\u2019ll have to settle for another run of Luka Doncic on national TV, which, of course, is nothing to discard. He\u2019s fresh off a brilliant November , he ended the Lakers\u2019 win streak on Sunday and is not above poking some good-natured fun at his teammates. How hot is Doncic? He\u2019s logged 15 straight games with at 20 points, five rebounds and five assists \u2014 which is the fourth-longest such streak since the ABA-NBA merger (1976-77). 4. Tough test awaits slumping Spurs:  A game in Houston vs. James Harden is hardly what San Antonio needs right now ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). It has lost 13 of its last 16 games, was demolished by the Pistons on Sunday night, ranks 27th in Defensive Rating (113.4) and 26th in opponent Effective Field Goal percentage ( 54.7% ). Yet despite all that, the Spurs are also still capable of beating a good team (see Friday\u2019s win vs. the LA Clippers ). It\u2019s clear, though, that some kind of renewed defensive effort is needed for the Spurs to change their fortunes. 5. Was it really that long ago?: Maybe it\u2019s just us, but it seems like eons ago that Carmelo Anthony, Paul George and Russell Westbrook were a feared trio in Oklahoma City. George will get his first look at the Portland-era version of Anthony ( 10 ET, TNT ) as his Clippers host the Blazers in what could be a great night cap game. Anthony has seemingly found his stride the last few games and perhaps seeing George will light another fire in Anthony to keep Portland rolling."},{"id":30255,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-win-streak-reaches-12-games","date":"2019-12-03","title":"4 stats to know about Bucks' 12-game win streak","content":"The Milwaukee Bucks made it look easy again on Monday, demolishing the New York Knicks 132-88 for their 12th straight victory. That win gave Milwaukee it\u2019s longest winning streak since the 1980s and got us thinking about some numbers you should know from their run to date. * * * 1. Milwaukee\u2019s winning streak is the longest in the NBA this season and the franchise\u2019s longest since the 1981-82 season. The Bucks (18-3) own the league\u2019s best record, ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers (17-3).  2. Not surprisingly, this 12-game win streak has been fueled by Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s play. He\u2019s had a double-double in 11 of the 12 games and came one rebound shy of making it perfect in a Nov. 30 romp against the Hornets. That game ended his string of 19 straight double-doubles, but he got back to work on Monday night. Antetokounmpo did so in amazing fashion needing just 22 minutes of game action to log 29 points and 15 rebounds against the Knicks. In doing so, he added another 25-point, 15-rebound game to his league-leading total this season. 3. The Bucks are not only rolling up the wins, they\u2019re rolling through opponents in the process. On Saturday, they beat the Hornets 137-96 ( a 41-point margin ) and followed that up with Monday\u2019s 44-point victory against the Knicks. They\u2019ll have a shot at some unique history on Wednesday against Detroit as they can become the first team to log three straight wins of 40 or more points. This scoring surge shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise, though. After averaging a league-high 118.1 ppg last season, the Bucks again lead the NBA in scoring so far this season with 120.8 ppg . In addition to that, Milwaukee has scored at least 100 points in their last 44 regular season games dating back to Feb. 23 of last season. 4. As good as Milwaukee has been, there\u2019s still a chance they could set more team records in the coming days. The Bucks just passed the season\u2019s quarter point and will play their 25th game of 2019-20 next week. The number 25 is significant because Milwaukee is on pace for perhaps its best start ever through that many games. The Bucks\u2019 next four games are as follows: at Detroit on Wednesday ( 7 ET, League Pass ), vs. the LA Clippers on Friday ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ), vs. the Orlando Magic on Dec. 9 ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and vs. the New Orleans Pelicans on Dec. 11 ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). A perfect run through those games would put the Bucks at 22-3 and give Milwaukee its best-ever start through the first 25 games of a season. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":30228,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-week-6-giannis-antetokounmpo-carmelo-anthony","date":"2019-12-02","title":"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony named NBA Players of the Week","content":" Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and Portland Trail Blazers forward Carmelo Anthony were named the NBA Players of the Week for Week 6.

He\u2019s fresh off a November in which he averaged a 30-point triple-double and has sparked the Dallas Mavericks to a surprising 13-6 start to 2019-20. Of course, no player in the NBA accomplishes things on their own and Doncic is no exception. He needs solid teammates around him, and for the Mavs this season, Maxi Kleber and Boban Marjanovic meet those qualifications. Kleber is the team\u2019s third-best rebounder (6.0 rpg) and is on pace for a career-high in 3-pointers made. As he has been in each of his NBA stops, the 7-foot-4 Marjanovic is a fan-favorite in Dallas while also providing timely minutes (as he did Sunday against the Lakers ). That trio took some time recently to answer Mavs fans\u2019 questions about the season and the results were hilarious.

Party like its the 1980s: The Bucks have been an unstoppable force of late, sporting an 11-game win streak and a 17-3 mark. The latter is the team\u2019s longest such run since 1984-85 and a win tonight in New York ( 8 ET, League Pass ) would give Milwaukee its longest win streak since 1981-82. Going even further back, Milwaukee\u2019s 17-3 start is its best since the \u201970-71 and \u201971-72 seasons. Since the 2013-14 season, Giannis Antetokounmpo is averaging 20.7 ppg and shooting 50.2% vs. the Knicks (and the Bucks are 15-3 in those games). 2. Opposites attract in Philly: The Jazz and Sixers are heading in opposite directions over their last nine games, with Utah going 4-5 over that stretch and Philadelphia at 7-2. The squads meet tonight ( 7 ET, NBA TV ) in a game that will feature superstar centers Rudy Gobert and Joel Embiid. As much as these big men will shape tonight\u2019s game, also worth watching is how this game could be a springboard for either squad. Utah has a somewhat-easy schedule in December while Philadelphia has the opposite scenario. 3. Rough run of it lately, huh?: Were it not for wins against the Bulls and Grizzlies, the Warriors would be in the midst of a 14-game losing streak. Were it not for John Collins\u2019 25-game suspension, the Hawks might not be in the midst of their 10-game slide. Either way, these two struggling teams meet ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) and perhaps the lone reason to watch might be for Trae Young. He has scored 30 or more in four of his last five games, including back-to-back games of 37 and 49 points . 4. When Dirk had it cooking \u2026: Fifteen years ago today, the Mavs and Rockets squared off in a showdown of West powers. While the Dirk Nowitzki-Tracy McGrady showdown likely received top billing back then, it was all about Nowitzki on this night. He lit up the Rockets for a single-game career-high 53 points in a 113-106 overtime win . Nowtizki scored 10 or more points in every quarter but the third (he had eight) and added 10 in OT to power the victory."},{"id":30312,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-cant-miss-matchups-carmelo-vs-lebron","date":"2019-12-02","title":"5 Can't-Miss Matchups: LeBron James vs. Carmelo Anthony","content":" Here\u2019s hoping that load management doesn\u2019t again ruin this rematch of the highly-anticipated one-one-one battle we expected to see earlier this season between Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. But if it does, we\u2019ve got several more clashes to choose from, including Saturday\u2019s contest pitting longtime friends LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony against one another for the first time in more than a year. Here\u2019s a look at this week\u2019s five can\u2019t-miss matchups: Last regular season meeting: Nov. 6, 2019 A nice rivalry has blossomed between Gobert, the two-time Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and Embiid, who has finished fourth and second, respectively, the last two years behind Gobert for the award. Even though Embiid was held scoreless last week for the first time of his career , the 76ers entered the weekend having won seven of their last 10 outings, while Utah headed into Sunday\u2019s matchup with wins in six of their last 10. The last time these two faced off, Embiid dropped 27 points to go with 16 rebounds, and although Gobert fouled out, the Jazz won. Embiid racked up the majority of his production in that game when he wasn\u2019t matched up against Gobert. In 6:42 going head to head against Gobert, Embiid scored 10 points on 2-of-3 shooting, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Embiid made it to the foul line eight times, knocking down six free throws. Flip that matchup around, and you\u2019ll see Gobert held his own against Embiid, scoring 15 points to go with two assists and three turnovers, per NBA Advanced Stats. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 17, 2018 Jokic owns what looks like a lopsided 6-3 advantage in this series, but he hasn\u2019t faced Davis since November of 2018. Back then, the new Lakers big played on a New Orleans Pelicans squad largely devoid of a talented supporting cast. This time, it\u2019s different with the two-loss Lakers entering this week having won 10 of their last 11 games . But don\u2019t sleep on the Nuggets, either, as they carry the second-best record in the West behind the Lakers. Jokic has been victorious in three of the past four matchups featuring two of the NBA\u2019s most talented big men. Matchup data from NBA Advanced Stats shows Davis has struggled somewhat in one-on-one clashes with Jokic, with the new Laker scoring 10 points, while shooting just 36% when he\u2019s guarded by Jokic. The last time they faced off, Jokic put up 11 points on 5-for-9 shooting with Davis guarding him, per NBA Advanced Stats. He also didn\u2019t commit any turnovers and went to the free-throw line once. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference .  Last regular season meeting: Jan. 31, 2019 Leonard\u2019s load management situation deprived us all of what should have been one of the most anticipated matchups between Kia MVP candidates back on Nov. 6 . The hope this time around is both players are fully healthy and ready to go. Leonard has dominated head-to-head in the regular season, racking up an 8-3 record in stints with the San Antonio Spurs and the Toronto Raptors. Leonard hasn\u2019t yet faced Antetokounmpo as a member of the LA Clippers. These players last butted heads in the 2019 playoffs, and the Raptors \u2014 behind 2-0 in the East finals \u2014 clearly changed their postseason fate for the better by having Leonard guard Antetokounmpo. Over the first two games of that series, Antetokounmpo averaged 27 ppg and 15.5 rpg while shooting 47.2%. Leonard\u2019s defense on Antetokounmpo over the rest of the series propelled the Raptors to a conference title, as the two-time Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year played a major role in limiting the Bucks star to of 20.5 ppg, 12.5 rpg and 43.5% shooting. Breaking down that matchup even further, Antetokounmpo managed an average of just 3.5 points in Games 3 through 6 with Leonard as the primary defender on 33.3% shooting, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Oct. 20, 2018 One of the feel-good stories of this young NBA season, Anthony is finally back in the NBA , and the Portland Trail Blazers entered the week on a three-game win streak with the 10-time All-Star in the lineup. James wasted no time welcoming back his good friend Anthony, the No. 3 overall pick of a 2003 NBA draft that featured the Lakers superstar as the No. 1 pick. Now, the two get a chance to match up for the 34th time in the regular season. The last time these players faced off was during Anthony\u2019s ill-fated 10-game stint with the Houston Rockets, and Anthony\u2019s team came out victorious with him featured in a limited role. According to matchup data from NBA Advanced Stats, Anthony was the primary defender on James for a little more than two minutes when these players last clashed, and the four-time Kia NBA MVP took only three shots against his good friend, missing them all. Anthony was scoreless when matched against James, too. But he never took a shot in what turned out to be a very brief one-on-one battle. Interestingly, the players in five postseason matchups against one another each average 27.8 ppg, with James\u2019 teams running off a 4-1 record in those games. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: March 15, 2019 Two of the NBA\u2019s most electrifying shooting guards get together for this one with Booker looking to make up some ground in this series. Harden holds a 9-1 edge in this matchup and nearly dropped a triple-double (41 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists) when he last faced Booker last March. Perhaps the most impressive stat of that night was Harden\u2019s six steals in Houston\u2019s win. Head-to-head, these players haven\u2019t matched up as much as you\u2019d expect. According to data from NBA Advanced Stats, when Booker has served as the primary defender on Harden in their last two matchups, the Houston star scored six points on 3-of-5 shooting, while dishing a pair of dimes. The data also tells us that when Harden guards Booker, he might want to protect the 3-point line. Harden managed to force a couple of Booker turnovers in their last two meetings, but the Suns guard scored 8 points and added an assist, knocking down 2 of 2 from deep while also getting to the free-throw line to sink a pair. Harden averages 2.1 steals in his last 10 games against the Suns. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

He was ruled out in the third quarter after taking what the Celtics termed a \u201ca direct blow to the abdomen\u201d in trying to take a charge from the Knicks\u2019 Kevin Knox. After the game, Smart said the injury is to his left oblique, which is the same oblique injury that caused him to miss the first round of the 2019 playoffs . He eventually returned in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Milwaukee Bucks, but was decidedly not his full self in that series. Aside from this recent injury, Smart has been dealing with hip, ankle and finger injuries all season as well. It was initially thought Smart injured his hip on Sunday, but he corrected that notion as he left for the team bus. \u201cNo, just in my oblique,\u201d he said, per the Boston Herald . \u201cRight in the same spot that I tore last season. It wasn\u2019t as bad as the tear, but it\u2019s still sore and pretty tender. We\u2019re just going to take it slow and day by day re-evaluate it (Monday), and see what we have to do.\u201d Smart didn\u2019t have surgery on his injury last season, but said there is still scar tissue in the area of that oblique injury. When asked if it might be time for him to miss a game or more to allow himself to heal up, Smart said (per the Boston Herald ): \u201cI think so. I think that might be it. That might be my final straw. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Aside from the oblique injury, Smart also took a shot to the eye from the Knicks\u2019 Damyean Dotson as well in Sunday\u2019s game. Per ESPN\u2019s Tim Bontemps , the Celtics are also hoping to get an update on the status of Gordon Hayward sometime Monday. Hayward has been out since Nov. 11 following surgery to repair a fractured bone in his left hand . He took part in 5-on-0, non-contact portions of practice on Saturday and was shooting before Sunday\u2019s game as team owner Wyc Grousbeck looked on.

Doncic tied a career-high with 42 points in a 120-113 win over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night and narrowly missed a triple-double with 11 assists and nine rebounds. The performance assured that he would become just the third player in NBA history to average a 30-point triple-double over a calendar month. He averaged 32.4 points, 10.3 rebounds and 10.4 assists over 15 games in November. The only other two players to accomplish the same feat are Oscar Robertson (five times) and Russell Westbrook (twice), according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \u201cI\u2019ve learned over my many years not to take anything for granted,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s just an exceptional player. Exceptional person. Exceptionally tough. You don\u2019t find that combination in 20-year-old guys coming into the NBA very often.\u201d Doncic was at his best on Friday against the Suns, controlling every aspect of the game. There were times when he would dribble into the lane and the Phoenix defense would be frozen, unsure of how to stop him. \u201cWe play our best when we get in the paint,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThat\u2019s the key for us.\u201d Tim Hardaway Jr. added 26 points for the Mavericks, but the team\u2019s usual second-leading scorer, Kristaps Porzingis, finished with just two points and missed all eight of his shots from the field. It didn\u2019t matter, though. Doncic wasn\u2019t going to let this one get away. The Mavericks improved to 12-6 , which is their best start since they won an NBA title in the 2010-11 season. \u201cThat\u2019s who he is,\u201d Phoenix coach Monty Williams said of Doncic. \u201cPorzingis didn\u2019t have it going, so he\u2019s hitting shots seven, eight feet behind the 3-point line. You\u2019ve got to get up. And then finishing at the basket, some of those shots, I thought we played good defense, he just got around us.\u201d Doncic has been even better in his second season, one year after winning the NBA\u2019s Rookie of the Year award. Carlisle said before the season that he wasn\u2019t sure if Doncic\u2019s production would improve considering the team had better players around him. But the Mavericks are leaning on him just as much as ever. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising but it\u2019s not shocking,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cOur team has taken its present form but it\u2019s still early in the season and there\u2019s a long way to go. We\u2019ll see where it goes from here, but he\u2019s having a spectacular year. \u201cJust absolutely breathtaking.\u201d"},{"id":30282,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-play-vs-warriors","date":"2019-11-29","title":"Jimmy Butler expected to return to lineup for Heat","content":" The Heat announced Wednesday that guard Jimmy Butler will likely play tonight against the Golden State Warriors ( 8 ET, League Pass ) after missing time due to illness.

Butler ended up not playing as the Heat lost 117-108 . Currently his first season with the Heat, Butler leads the team in scoring (18.9 ppg), assists (6.7 apg) and steals (2.6 spg) while ranking among the team leaders in several other categories .

Player acquisition is as much art as it is science, which requires more work to be done outside of those 30 first-round slots in a given Draft. Draft night surprises come in all shapes and sizes, beyond the first round sometimes and even after the Draft is over. Plenty of former second-round picks and undrafted players \u2013 both veterans and youngsters \u2013 are making their mark around the league this season. That group includes NBA champions, All-Stars, award winners and franchise staples such as Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap, DeAndre Jordan, Kyle Korver and Lou Williams. It also includes surprising rookies like Eric Paschall and Kendrick Nunn, who will square off tonight in Miami when Paschall\u2019s Golden State Warriors visit Nunn\u2019s Miami Heat ( 8 ET, League Pass ). Here\u2019s a look at five players \u2013 some of them former second-rounders, some of them undrafted players \u2013 shining bright this season. * * * Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana Pacers: A staple for a Milwaukee team that earned the best record in the league last season, Brogdon left for Indiana this past offseason and is flourishing in his new role there. A second-round pick in 2016 ( No. 36 overall ), Brogdon was the Kia Rookie of the Year in 2016-17 and leads the Pacers in points (19.0 ppg) and assists (8.1 apg) as they await the return of All-Star guard Victor Oladipo. The heartland \u201cBig Three\u201d of Oladipo, Brogdon and Domantas Sabonis forms the nucleus of the scrappy bunch coach Nate McMillan directs that could be a dark horse contender in the Eastern Conference this season. Spencer Dindwiddie, Brooklyn Nets: T he reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week , Dinwiddie is a critical component for a Nets team grinding along without Kevin Durant . A second-round pick ( No. 39 overall ) of the Detroit Pistons in 2014, he spent his first two seasons with the Pistons before finding a home with the rebuilding Nets in 2016-17. Kyrie Irving is the Nets\u2019 best player but Dinwiddie has been their most consistent and reliable performer to this point of the season. Montrezl Harrell, LA Clippers: On a team with superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, it would be easy to overlook the contributions of a grinder like Harrell. He can\u2019t even claim the title of best sixth man on his own team (given that Lou Williams is the NBA\u2019s reigning award-winner there ). Clippers coach Doc Rivers could care less about labels where the relentless Harrell, a second-round pick in 2015 ( No. 32 overall by Houston ), is concerned. Harrell could easily be a starter (and perhaps an All-Star) on a lot of other teams. But he\u2019s an invaluable piece, as both a game-changing reserve (alongside Williams) and a tone-setter in the paint for the deepest in the league. If the Clippers reach their championship goals this season, it\u2019ll be with Harrell playing a major role. Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat: A nyone outside of Miami who says they saw Nunn coming this season couldn\u2019t pass a lie detector test. Plenty of folks in Miami couldn\u2019t have predicted the undrafted rookie would get off to this sort of start for a Heat team that was prepared to lean on Jimmy Butler all season. Nunn plays with an ease that suggest he, more than anyone else, knew he was destined to be this good. Unlike many of his peers, he\u2019s shown no signs of trepidation about asserting himself on offense as a starter for what looks like an Eastern Conference playoff team. Nunn has cooled from his sizzling October (22.4 ppg, 48.4% on 3-pointers), but is still holding his own in ways few expected. Eric Paschall, Golden State Warriors: Speaking of pleasant surprises, Paschall has been a glaring bright spot in an otherwise dreadful start to the Warriors\u2019 difficult season. What makes Paschall\u2019s star turn even more intriguing is that he\u2019s operating with the patron saint of second rounders, Green, serving as a mentor. If anyone understands how to appreciate the sudden rise and impact of a second-round pick ( Paschall went No. 41 in 2019 ), it\u2019s the Warriors. Paschall burst on the scene with a 34-point, 13-round performance on his birthday against the Portland Trail Blazers. An undersized power forward (6-foot-6, 255 pounds) with a blue-blood college pedigree (Villanova), Paschall plays with a confidence and awareness on both ends that should remind Bay Area fans of Green\u2019s rise years ago . * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

No more drama. No more \u201cme.\u201d And a lot more \u201cwe.\u201d When the Timberwolves decided to make structural changes to the front office and coaching staff, Towns made sure that a culture change was a part of the plan as well. \u201c This culture is about family, and we are in this to win,\u201d Towns said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t in this for individual accolades, or any of that stuff. This is the culture that we have built here in Minnesota, and the league is recognizing that.\u201d The league also recognizes that the leader of the Timberwolves\u2019 band is one of the truly unique talents in the game, one who has played his way into the Top 10 of this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. \u201cI think he [Towns] is the best big man in the league,\u201d said a former Eastern Conference head coach. \u201cHe\u2019s got everything. He can play inside and out and he can dominate on both ends. There isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s required at his position that he can\u2019t do.\u201d The Timberwolves are two games above .500 and on pace to make the playoffs, with coach Ryan Saunders still tweaking his lineups and rotations to get the desired results. Towns is averaging career highs in scoring (26.3 ppg), rebounding (12.6 rpg) and assists (4.1 apg) while shooting 51.3% overall and 44.4% on 3-pointers. He\u2019s also averaging 1.1 steals (another career high) and 1.5 blocks. So far, things are going according to plan both on and off the court. \u201cI have confidence in the integrity and the will in those people in the locker room and I know what they\u2019ll do when they put those jerseys on,\u201d Towns said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing more than I\u2019ve ever done, I\u2019m able to do more than I\u2019ve ever been asked to or been allowed to do. I\u2019m just having fun and showing more and more facets of my game. And there\u2019s a lot more left in me to show.\u201d Saunders is all in on the master plan, knowing that the Timberwolves\u2019 fate this season rests squarely on the shoulders of their young leader and best player. Having a 7-footer that can shoot 40 percent from the arc provides opportunities most teams can only dream of, while also requiring a coach to help his star balance his approach. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with Karl with what he\u2019s been able to do, on the court and off the court with this group,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cWe do have a younger team and sometimes years of service plays in to you being a veteran. It\u2019s been good for Karl to have to accept that role as well. He\u2019s done a lot of things away from the basketball court, whether it be team gatherings and things that he does with his teammates, but also being a vocal leader, too. He\u2019s had a nice start to the year, but it\u2019s something you\u2019re never satisfied with.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  31.1 points, 13.7 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.4 blocks Antetokounmpo and the Bucks rolled without their other All-Star, Khris Middleton, in the lineup as \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d did it all (a triple-double, a 50-point game, etc.). He was as devastating as ever with Middleton back in the mix for Wednesday\u2019s win against Atlanta (Milwaukee\u2019s ninth straight), piling up 30 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and four blocks. Last week: No. 2 Season stats:   25.8 points, 11.0 assists, 7.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals LeBron ceded the stage to Anthony Davis in the big man\u2019s first trip to New Orleans in a Lakers uniform. Davis dominated, the Lakers got the win and LeBron put on a show of his own (29 points, 11 assists, five rebounds, two steals) with his league-leading 12th game of 20-plus points and 10-plus assists. Under his guidance, the Lakers have tied the best 18-game start in team history.  Last week: No. 6 Season stats: 22.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.6 assists While the fans at TD Garden were busy trolling Kyrie Irving on Wednesday, Walker was doing his best to remind everyone why the Celtics are happy with the man who replaced him. Walker torched the Nets for a season-high 39 points, six assists and four rebounds in his first outing after missing one game with a neck injury.  Last week: No. 3 Season stats:  30.1 points, 10.0 rebounds, 9.5 assists, 1.5 steals Doncic won\u2019t see many teams with the defensive personnel and firepower the Clippers threw at him Tuesday , when his streak of 30-point, 10-assist games came to an end. That one game, however, does not diminish the impact he\u2019s had on the Mavericks this season. He\u2019s still one of the NBA\u2019s most difficult players to guard.  Last week: No. 4 Season stats:   37.7 points 7.8 assists, 6.1 rebounds, 1.6 steals Harden\u2019s status as the most unstoppable scorer in the league is not in danger. But he\u2019s seeing double teams these days that he readily admits he\u2019s never seen before. If these new schemes have the usual effect, Harden will go back to the lab and come up with a new wrinkle of his own, which is necessary for the Rockets to keep pace in the Western Conference playoff race. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?
