[{"id":30308,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/things-know-nba-nov-29","date":"2019-11-29","title":"7 NBA things to know for Nov. 29","content":" 1. Going streaking (Part I): At 15-3, the Bucks are off to their best start since 1973-74 and have a nine-game win streak working, too. The last time Milwaukee rang up 10 straight wins, it was 1986 and Sidney Moncrief was their best player. The Bucks have a shot at matching that feat tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) against the Cavs, who have lost two in a row and eight of their last nine games. On paper, this seems like an easy win for the Bucks, given the Cavs\u2019 23rd-ranked defense and that Cleveland couldn\u2019t slow the Bucks in an Oct. 28 matchup . 2. Going streaking (Part II): The Lakers are 16-2 and just slightly better record-wise this season than the Bucks. They, too, are seeking their first 10-game win streak (which last came for L.A. during the 2009-10 season). A matchup with the Wizards ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) and their No. 2-ranked offense ( 113.5 Off. Rating ) will provide a stiff test for the Lakers\u2019 solid defense ( No. 8, 103.3 Def. Rating ). Big man Anthony Davis is listed as probable tonight as the Lakers try to keep Bradley Beal and Washington in check. 3. Siakam on a hot streak: You have to feel for the Magic. Not only are they one of the NBA\u2019s worst road teams, but in their next game ( 7 ET, League Pass ), they get to try and slow down Pascal Siakam. Toronto\u2019s star forward is averaging 25.6 ppg over his last five games and, more impressively, is shooting better than 50% from the field and 3-point range. The Raptors are riding high and staying in the conversation for the East\u2019s best team as they seek their sixth straight win, too. 4. Clippers roll into San Antonio: Another year, another Kawhi Leonard return game to San Antonio. Version 2.0 of Leonard heading back to Texas has a decidedly different flavor ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) given Leonard has another new team (the Clippers), the state of the Spurs (they\u2019ve lost 10 of 11) and the state of the Clippers (they\u2019re on a seven-game win streak). Since the win streak started on Nov. 16, the Clippers lead the NBA in rebounds, rank third in points and steals, second in plus\/minus differential (14.1) and ninth in assists. 5. Celtics, Nets meet again: The Celtics went into Thanksgiving with a win, dominating the Nets in a 121-110 victory on Nov. 27. Kyrie Irving (shoulder) missed that game and will reportedly miss this afternoon\u2019s edition as well ( Noon ET, League Pass ). Brooklyn will have to do a better job on Kemba Walker, who lit up Brooklyn for a season-best 39 points and showed no ill effects from his neck injury suffered last week. Of particular interest in this game will be rebounding: the Nets are solid at it ( 50.2 rebound percentage , 12th in NBA) and the Celtics have struggled with it this season. 6. Pacers starting to find rhythm: Don\u2019t look now, but Indiana has won four in a row and is within reasonable striking distance of the Bucks, Celtics and Raptors for the East\u2019s upper crust. A date with the struggling Hawks is next ( 8 ET, League Pass ) as Indiana tries to go 4-0 in its recent home stand. The Pacers are definitely figuring things out after their 0-3 start: they\u2019ve won 11 of 14 since then and are outscoring opponents by an average of 7.7 ppg during that span. 7. When the Mamba retirement tour began \u2026: On Nov. 29, 2015, Lakers legend Kobe Bryant announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2015-16 season via a poem on The Players\u2019 Tribune . After that, Bryant began one of the most memorable farewell tours in NBA history. Bryant received standing ovations, gifts and more from opposing fans, players and teams around the league as he played his final games."},{"id":30285,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-out-brooklyn-nets-boston-celtics","date":"2019-11-28","title":"Report: Kyrie Irving out for Friday's game vs. Celtics","content":" Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving will have to wait to face his former team. The All-Star guard is expected to miss Friday\u2019s matchup against the Boston Celtics ( Noon ET, League Pass ) due to a lingering right shoulder injury, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic. ESPN\u2019s Tim Bontemps reports that coach Kenny Atkinson said Friday that Irving was set to be further evaluated Friday morning in hopes of providing an update after the game vs. Boston. Irving has missed seven straight games with the injury, which the team describes as a \u201cshoulder impingement\u201d, including the Nets\u2019 first matchup with Boston on Wednesday night. Irving, who left the Celtics as a free agent this summer, is averaging 28.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.2 assists, while shooting 44.4% overall and 34.1% from 3-point range during his first 11 games of the season."},{"id":30315,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-20-kia-rookie-ladder-nov-28","date":"2019-11-28","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Ja Morant keeps on dominating","content":"We\u2019re just eight weeks into the season, but if votes were tallied right now, Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant would most likely be a runaway winner for Kia Rookie of the Year. It\u2019s early, of course, but Morant has done it all in his young career. He leads all rookies in scoring (19.1 ppg) and assists (6.6 apg). He\u2019s gone toe-to-toe with superstars and hasn\u2019t flinched, he\u2019s had game-winning shots , and he\u2019s drawn raves from virtually every opposing coach. And if he wants to hold off the rookie pack (and you-know-who Zion Williamson will be back soon enough), he\u2019ll need to finish strong. Luckily for him, closing out strong has become one of his strengths. Among all NBA players, Morant ranks sixth among fourth-quarter scorers, averaging 8.5 ppg while shooting 51.6% overall. Only five players \u2014 James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal and Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 score more in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s some good company. Morant seems to thrive in big moments, and the Grizzlies succeed when Morant has the ball in his hands to create for his team. Against the Lakers on Saturday , Morant scored nine points and had three steals in the final quarter, but LeBron James and L.A. hung on for the 109-108 win. Morant had several big plays, including a sick fake for a layup , a ridiculous up-and-under layup and finally a cutting layup to bring Memphis within one with less than 30 seconds left. The Lakers hung on, but it left Morant pleased by the effort. \u201cI think it just flat out shows (our growth),\u201d Morant said . \u201cThat no matter what, we can be in ball games and win ball games. We weren\u2019t able to close out tonight, but tonight showed what type of team we are and who we want to be. I\u2019m never satisfied with losing, but I can say I\u2019m satisfied with how we played. We played together and competed to the end and just came up short.\u201d Wednesday night, Morant had another chance against the other L.A. squad, and again the lanky point guard came alive late as the Grizzlies nearly pulled off a big upset of the LA Clippers. After being held scoreless in the first half, Morant scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter , including an around-the-back move on the break and a deep 3-pointer that ignited the crowd. Morant made a mistake late with the game tied at 119, giving the ball up with 5 seconds left on the shot clock, which ultimately led to a poor 3-point attempt . The Clippers would capitalize, getting the 121-119 win on a Montrezl Harrell tip-in with 2.3 left. Morant couldn\u2019t help the Grizzlies avoid the five-game losing streak, but he once again showed he\u2019s not afraid of big moments and even if the effort isn\u2019t resulting in wins, he\u2019s gaining a reputation as the Grizzlies\u2019 go-to player down the stretch. * * * Last week: No. 1 Morant, known for his hard-charging drives to the rim, had a scare in Monday\u2019s loss to the Pacers. In that game, he crashed into a cameraman on the baseline after a layup attempt was blocked by Myles Turner. Morant got up gingerly and would have to be helped off the court by teammates. He would return to the game, and didn\u2019t seem to show signs of the injury Wednesday night. When asked the next day if he would consider his all-out style of attacking the rim, Morant brushed off the question . \u201cI\u2019ve been playing like this all my life. It got me here and I\u2019m gonna continue to play like that. I\u2019m willing to lay my body on the line for my team.\u201d  Last week: No. 5 Herro had another solid week, averaging 17.3 ppg on 40.7% shooting. He\u2019s continuing to get big minutes, and Herro\u2019s work in spot-up situations has helped him see significant change, as noted by the Miami Herald \u2019s Anthony Chiang . \u201cIt\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been working on every morning before practice is catch and shoot,\u201d Herro said. \u201cObviously, the hard work is starting to pay off. But just continue to get those reps in and expect to get even more efficient.\u201d Last week: No. 2 If you ask him, the undrafted Nunn is your Rookie of the Year. And there\u2019s no doubt. \u201c I definitely feel like I\u2019m the Rookie of the Year,\u201d Nunn told Shams Charania of The Athletic . \u201cIt\u2019s early, but the way I\u2019ve been performing, definitely, I\u2019m in the running for that. And hopefully, I continue this throughout the season and win that award.\u201d Nunn struggled in both of Miami\u2019s losses this week, putting up six points on 3-for-10 shooting in Philly , then scoring just nine on 3-for-11 shooting on Wednesday in a loss to the Rockets. That\u2019s not exactly Rookie of the Year numbers, but like he said, \u201cIt\u2019s early.\u201d Last week: No. 3 Paschall finished the week strong, scoring 25 points and grabbing seven rebounds to lead Golden State to a 104-90 win against Chicago on Wednesday. It was his sixth game of 20-plus points, second only among rookies to Ja Morant (9) and Kendrick Nunn (7). Last week: No. 4 Barrett\u2019s return to Canada, where he grew up watching the Raptors, didn\u2019t got as well as he\u2019d hoped. After missing Sunday\u2019s game with an illness, Barrett scored 16 points in Wednesday\u2019s loss , but struggled from the field, going 5-for-17 (2-for-8 on 3-pointers) and had four turnovers. \u201cI had too many emotions,\u201d said Barrett, who received a warm ovation from Raptors fans. \u201cI was so happy all day. Literally the whole time before the game I was trying to calm myself down for two hours.\u201d Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies:  Over his last 10 games, Clark is proving his efficiency, shooting 68.2% overall and 53.8% on 3-pointers. He continues to lead all rookies in FG% and is sixth among all players (63.6%). DeAndre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks:  Atlanta is mired in an eight-game losing streak, but Hunter continues to show why the Hawks got him at No. 4. In a matchup with Toronto last week, Hunter put up 26 on 10-for-17 shooting, hitting 6 of 10 3-pointers while also handing out four assists. Ky Bowman, Golden State Warriors:  Bowman has been handed the point guard duties, and has produced with the increased playing time. He started two of the Warriors\u2019 last three games, logging 15.3 ppg, 4.3 apg, 2.0 spg while shooting 45.9% overall and 46.2% on 3-pointers. As long as he sees 30-plus minutes per night, he should be in the discussion to climb up the Ladder. Coby White, Chicago Bulls:  White\u2019s up-and-down season continued this week. The guard caught fire with 28 points on 12-for-19 shooting, hitting 4 of 9 3-pointers in Chicago\u2019s 116-115 win against Charlotte. The next two games? Ten total points total on 3-for-20 shooting (1-for-12 on 3-pointers). PJ Washington, Charlotte Hornets: After five straight single-digit scoring games (all losses, coincidentally), Washington bounced back to score 17 on 7-for-11 shooting in Charlotte\u2019s 102-101 win over the Pistons. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 27 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

He answered by making it rain buckets in his former building. Anthony Davis scored 41 points in his first game back at New Orleans since an awkwardly public trade demand was ultimately granted last summer. Now teamed up with LeBron James in Los Angeles, Davis faced the team that drafted him No. 1 overall in 2012 \u2014 and reminded them of the talent they enjoyed if not necessarily succeeded with. \u201cComing in and knowing what was going to happen with the boos,\u201d Davis admitted, \u201cI just tried to play through it and calm my nerves and just play basketball.\u201d He did that and then some. Set up early and often by James, Davis did nearly all of his damage in the paint and at the free throw line while being relentlessly booed throughout the game. The crowd\u2019s disapproval nearly worked in the closing seconds, when Davis missed one of two free throws to give New Orleans the ball with 5.3 seconds left and the Lakers up by just two. Instead, Davis stole the inbounds pass intended for Brandon Ingram \u2014 the centerpiece to the Pelicans\u2019 trade return for Davis \u2014 and finished off the 114-110 L.A. victory at the free throw line. The All-Star big man finished with 41 points \u2014 an NBA record for most scored by an NBA player against his former team. As vindictive as both reception and performance felt, such emotion was non-existent between Davis and his former team. He and Jrue Holiday, who together led New Orleans past Portland in a first-round playoff upset two years ago, exchanged jerseys immediately after the game. Later, Davis was invited into the Pelicans locker room by coach Alvin Gentry to say hello to the rest of his old teammates. As for the fans, Davis seemed understanding while also hopeful that the worst of the leftover acrimony is now behind him. \u201cI know they\u2019re passionate about their team,\u201d Davis acknowledged . \u201cWhen everything went down last year, it was tough for both sides.\u201d The Lakers\u2019 happiness is more immediate. Los Angeles now rides a nine-game winning streak into Thanksgiving, part of a 16-2 overall record that is best in the league. Davis entered the night averaging 26.1 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.8 blocks and 1.6 steals, numbers that will all but assure him of his seventh consecutive All-Star berth. Combined with James, who surpassed 33,000 career points and currently leads the league in assists, the Lakers are considered a title contender. New Orleans, meanwhile, still awaits the debut of No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, the most unquestioned top overall selection since (at least) Davis. Williamson underwent surgery to repair a torn right meniscus before the regular season began. The Pelicans have also dealt with sporadic injury woes to their other top players, which have factored into their 6-12 start. Yet if Ingram continues his career year and Williamson returns healthy, New Orleans\u2019 future appears bright with young talent and a wealth of draft picks acquired in the trade for Davis. That, Davis says, should help the Pelicans move on from what was to what will be. \u201cBoth sides moved on and both sides are happy,\u201d Davis summed up. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":30293,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-fourth-reach-33000-points","date":"2019-11-28","title":"LeBron James fourth player to reach 33,000 career points","content":" Mark yet another notch in LeBron James\u2019 belt of career achievements. The Lakers forward became the fourth player in NBA history to surpass 33,000 career points on Wednesday night. The four-time Kia MVP hit the mark with a 3-pointer over New Orleans rookie Jaxson Hayes \u2014 who was three years old when James began his NBA odyssey in 2003. Back then, James was not known for his 3-point shooting. This season he is hitting 35% from 3-point range, the eighth time hie in his career he\u2019s shot 35% or better. The three-time NBA champion also lead the league with 11.0 assists per game and ranks 10th all-time on the NBA assists list. Yet for all his unselfish diversity, James\u2019 scoring has seen him climb past the best bucket-getting legends of the game. After passing Michael Jordan last season, James is just over 600 points away from Kobe Bryant, who sits third all-time behind Karl Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar."},{"id":30253,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-kevin-love-returns-9-points","date":"2019-11-28","title":"Cavaliers' Kevin Love returns after missing two games","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers forward Kevin Love returned against Orlando after missing two games because of a sore back. In Cleveland\u2019s 116-104 loss , he scored nine points with five rebounds in 23 minutes. Love has averaged team highs of 17.9 points and 11.8 rebounds in 14 games. He had been listed as questionable, but was in the starting lineup Wednesday after completing pregame warmups.

Turns out one game off was plenty. Walker poured in 39 points in his first game back from an initially scary-looking neck strain, leading Boston past Brooklyn 121-110 on Wednesday. The veteran playmaker scored from everywhere on the floor, including a whirling, double-clutch layup that left no doubt as to his wellbeing. Walker\u2019s return was met with adoring cheers from the Celtics home crowd, which also produced jeers for the injured-and-absent Kyrie Irving. After an up-and-down two-year run with Irving, Boston allowed the All-NBA point guard to sign with Brooklyn during the offseason while pivoting to the acquisition of Walker from Charlotte. The point guard swap appears to be working for Boston, which at 13-4 currently sits in second place in the Eastern Conference. Brooklyn (9-9) continues to adjust to its more star-oriented roster after a surprising playoff run last season. For Walker, his new chapter is a refreshing one after seven years of being surrounded with subpar talent in Charlotte. Despite just three playoff appearances since 2004, Walker is the only Hornets draftee to make an All-Star game in that span. Now the former ninth overall pick finds himself playing with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart for a Celtics team hoping to pounce in the Eastern Conference. Walker is a key part of that push, averaging 22.3 points while shooting 40.4 percent from 3-point range."},{"id":30254,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/josh-richardson-76ers-exits-hamstring","date":"2019-11-28","title":"Josh Richardson exits Kings-76ers with hamstring tightness","content":" Philadelphia\u2019s vaunted starting five had played together in less than half of Philadelphia\u2019s games due to injuries entering Wednesday night .

Games, games and more games: Unless you\u2019re a fan of the Mavs or Nuggets, your favorite NBA team is working tonight. The 14-game slate starts with Nets vs. Celtics ( 7 ET, ESPN ), which will feature the return of Kemba Walker . From there, plenty of enticing (and non-marquee) matchups abound. From a pair of East vs. West clashes (Jazz-Pacers at 7 ET on League Pass and Wizards-Suns at 9 ET on League Pass ) to two late-night games featuring youthful squads (Thunder-Blazers, 10 ET on League Pass and Bulls-Warriors, 10:30 ET on League Pass ), there\u2019s plenty to enjoy as Thanksgiving nears.  2. Welcome back, AD (?): The Pelicans have struggled to start 2019-20, but this date is one their fans have had circled on the calendar for a long time. Having the Lakers in town ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) means Anthony Davis returns to the place where he first rose to NBA stardom. Throw in the Lakers being in the midst of an eight-game win streak , LeBron James playing at a Kia MVP level and you\u2019ve got storylines and fuel aplenty for this matchup. Should be interesting to see exactly how the home crowd reacts to Davis being back in town. 3. Heat face big test: It may be easy to forget that, entering tonight, the Heat are 12-4 and have the Eastern Conference\u2019s second-best record. A blowout loss to the Sixers on Saturday (in Jimmy Butler\u2019s Philadelphia homecoming) took a little luster off Miami\u2019s record. Completing a season-series sweep of the Rockets, though ( 8 ET, League Pass ), would go a long way in restoring what many think about Miami this season. Unfortunately for the Heat, Butler will be sidelined for the game with an illness. 4. Bucks get even better: What do you get the East\u2019s No. 1 team for a pre-Thanksgiving gift (if there is such a thing)? How about an All-Star shooting guard named Khris Middleton. The Bucks look for their ninth straight win ( 8 ET, League Pass ) as the Hawks come to town and should have a fully stocked lineup when they do so. Middleton had missed the last two weeks with a left thigh contusion, but said at Tuesday\u2019s practice he\u2019s ready to play vs. Atlanta . 5. Raptors try to stay hot, too: Toronto native (and Knicks guard) RJ Barrett has his first NBA homecoming tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), but it may not go well for him. The Raptors are seeking their fifth straight win, are undefeated (7-0) at home and have picked up their offense of late, ranking No. 5 in Offensive Rating so far this month . Given the Knicks\u2019 bottom-feeding defense and 0-5 mark against Atlantic Division foes, Toronto has a solid chance to exit Wednesday night with its streak in tact. 6. Clippers in a zone : The Clippers scored a big win on Tuesday night, rolling past the Mavericks on the road to push their win streak to six games. A date with the Grizzlies ( 8 ET, League Pass ) seems like an easier task, but even with Kawhi Leonard sitting out for load management reasons that may not be the case. L.A. is 2-3 this season when Leonard sits, which means Paul George (22 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 4.8 apg in last four games) will have a bigger burden to tote."},{"id":30313,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kemba-walker-listed-probable-against-nets","date":"2019-11-27","title":"Celtics' Kemba Walker available to play tonight vs. Nets","content":" Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker will be back in the lineup against the Brooklyn Nets tonight ( 7 ET, ESPN ), the team announced.

(Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited). * * * NBA.com : Where are you these days? I know you\u2019re from Chicago, but I also know you love you some Memphis. Tony Allen : I\u2019m in Memphis. I stayed down here simply because, man, I don\u2019t get love like this anywhere else. I\u2019ve been in a lot of states. But for real, for real, from just going to get gas, seeing school teachers, people who are just doing stuff for the community, just having those relationships with those people and those people just seeing me outside of events or whatever, they respect the work that I put in to those areas. Not only that, but also what I embodied on the court in Memphis. I\u2019ve been everywhere. I won a championship in Boston. I get love out there, but the love that I get here, and even from my hometown (Chicago), it\u2019s just a whole different type of love. What are you doing these days? TV, radio, what kind of stuff? I\u2019m trying to get into that field. I sat back and gave myself a year and a half, two basketball seasons, and I reflected. I was like, \u2018Yo, let me just go ahead and see what these, what we call experts are saying.\u2019 I think my opinion matters. I played on the hardwood, battled with some of the best. I know that routine and preparing for competition. It\u2019s like, I did it at a high level and I prepared at a high level. If we needed extra assistance on the defensive end, I\u2019ve mastered that. I think I did. I prepared myself to be the best. And I study talents. I study all types of talents, man, from 6-10 guys, even guys as short as Lou Williams that score the ball. My job was definitely embraced with toughness, pride, and hanging my hat on that end. Explain how you earned your defensive prowess. I think that all started when I was young. [My college coach Eddie] Sutton, he told me that I was going to have to start changing my game to be more defensive-minded, and was teaching me the tools. When I got to Boston, I still thought I was like a player of the year kind of guy. Before all that, I thought I was this prolific type of scorer. These guys needed me to be a puzzle. Doc [Rivers] told me if I wanted to be on the court, I needed to be making the 50-50 plays, diving for loose balls, taking charges and trying to make plays. That\u2019s how I would stay on the court. A lot of people look at that as a role player. But a lot of players in the league have too much pride to even take that type of conversation from a coach because guys are so talented coming in.  Aren\u2019t you trying to start an academy that focuses primarily on teaching defense sort of like what Kobe Bryant is doing with the Mamba Academy ? We want to pretty much take that same format out there with what they\u2019re doing with the offensive camps. The mindset of it is they\u2019re taking the defense out of the game now. And you\u2019ve got a lot of guys who could improve on the defensive end. I\u2019m just going to throw a name out there right now, and I\u2019m not saying he needs improvement. But let\u2019s say [Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Andrew] Wiggins to throw a name out there speaking hypothetically to give you an example of the mindset of our camp. He\u2019s skilled, he\u2019s talented, but if he could get a few techniques in how to defend the pick-and-roll, going over, picking his poison, and how to limit guys with numerous attributes to their games, that could help. Hell, let\u2019s throw in Devin Booker. Monty Williams is a defensive-minded coach, who probably wants Devin to be more defensive-minded moving forward. There are guys who probably could improve at trying to stop guys with numerous amounts of attributes in one-on-one situations. I\u2019ve mastered that. I know I\u2019ve studied a lot of film on that. I know a lot of coverages that the league is playing right now. Such as? The bigs are pretty much not even in the play. It\u2019s like a three-man pick-and-roll because the bigs are so far back in the pick-and-roll. I guess they want you to give up the mid-range shot. However, when you\u2019ve got guys like Damian Lillard, who sees a wide-open goal when he comes off the pick-and-roll, it\u2019s like a layup and a basket. I want to teach bigs as well. Who\u2019s the big from Washington, [Thomas] Bryant? They\u2019re probably implementing that style of defense for him, but hey, wouldn\u2019t it be great to have that knowledge to be great in a show pick-and-roll where the big is up a little more, where a big can pretty much blitz the pick-and-roll, pretty much trap the pick-and-roll or have the agility and the mindset of how we\u2019re going to defend it. In this academy, you\u2019ll have those tools. Defense in the league is pretty much a lost art. What greater guy to teach that than me? So how do you decide who to invite? That\u2019s the conversation now. Like, how elite do we want to go? We\u2019ll do maybe college kids, high school kids, and have pros be invited to the camp not only to just participate and get the knowledge, but just to keep it elite and getting the best of the best in there to keep up that defense-first mindset.  For you, who are the dogs on defense in the NBA right now? I\u2019ve got a handful of guys I love. Obviously, don\u2019t nothing move without us talking about Kawhi Leonard. Those battles with him were always the ones you made sure you got your nice rest for. However, me looking at the game now, I just think Kawhi pretty much dominates both ends. Him alongside his other two teammates Paul George and Patrick Beverley, those guys are pretty much standouts. But you can\u2019t talk defense without saying what\u2019s up to my First-Team All-Defense alumni Marcus Smart. I like the way that he\u2019s implemented the 3-ball to his game to add playmaking and ball skills. Also, he calls himself a stretch 6. He\u2019s a sixth-man that can stick 1 through 5. The league is going small. You catch the guy sticking Kevin Love in some games. Then, you catch him sticking Damian Lillard. So, he\u2019s 1 through 5, you know what I mean? He said that he\u2019s on \u201canother level.\u201d Right, he\u2019s definitely on another level. I like the way he implements a little bit of acting in there. He does it to get some charges, and he does a little bit of antics. He looks like he\u2019s always agitated. I love his swagger. But those guys I just mentioned are some of the names that stand out the most in today\u2019s game to me. You mentioned Paul Pierce earlier. Seems like you\u2019ve got a ton of respect for him. Can you tell me about the relationship with him? Funny story, but our relationship really kicked off in Summer League. He came and visited one of the games right after I got drafted. He looked at all of us, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up rooks?\u201d Everybody turned around. Then he came and stood behind me and was like, \u201cOh, this is young fella huh? OK. I\u2019ve got $500 for five dunks.\u201d And I was like, five dunks? Yo, that\u2019s easy. I got two dunks right off the rip. He sat there and watched me get five dunks. He gave me my $500, and ever since then we\u2019ve just been cool. I was like the little brother that he never had and he was like the big brother that I never had or something like that. We\u2019re just real cool, man.  That championship squad that you played on in Boston had so many dominant personalities \u2014 Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett and more. How did you guys navigate relationships with all those personalities? I think Doc Rivers gave everybody the freedom to speak their minds when they saw something. There could be times in film sessions where certain guys would get into arguments. We respected everybody\u2019s opinion. There would be times we would be at the gym watching film, and I\u2019d see Rondo say, \u201cRewind the tape. Ticket (Kevin Garnett), you need to be here.\u201d We\u2019re men. Not only that, we actually liked each other. We actually loved hanging around each other. If we go into a town, Ticket would be like, \u201cWe\u2019re all going out to eat, yo.\u201d We were around each other more than we were around our own families. When adversity hits or tempers flare or whatever, we could understand where somebody is coming from. With that being said, I just think that respect was probably the common denominator through all that. Everybody respected each other. We all rode for each other. I heard a story about y\u2019all putting on the boxing gloves at practice one day to settle differences. Did this really happen? (Laughing) Yeah, man. The boxing gloves were definitely an idea from Paul Pierce. All I can remember is him bothering Patrick O\u2019Bryant. Patrick O\u2019Bryant was in there eating breakfast, and Paul Pierce didn\u2019t like that he was eating breakfast before he got his workout in. He thought he should\u2019ve been out there in the gym working with him, instead of chilling in there lounging. He said, \u201cYou know what, from now on I ain\u2019t gonna raise my voice at nobody.\u201d He said, \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a problem, we\u2019re putting on the gloves.\u201d I found it real funny man. I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, P, this dude is 7-feet tall and you\u2019re trying to put some gloves on this athletic frame here?\u201d He was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got gloves for everybody because I\u2019m tired of everybody bickering.\u201d Just in case, he had all sizes. So then it just became a funny thing. I was like, \u201cYo, OK. I know somebody I want to box.\u201d Man, we came in there, and all I can remember is me picking out Glen Baby Davis. I remember me trying to get my first little couple of swings at him, and all I can remember is Glen Davis knocking me out. Boom. I fell. They said, \u201cAwww, he\u2019s knocked out.\u201d They all started laughing and running. That was probably one of the most weird ways to bring in camaraderie and bring in love and togetherness. But it was funny, man.   Who was the toughest cover in all your years in the league? Kobe Bryant, obviously. No other player that I\u2019ve ever played against fouled me out in like eight minutes. I\u2019d have our video guy give me every move he would make over the last 12 games [and] put everything in segments. I\u2019d find myself waking up in the morning watching the laptop while I\u2019m brushing my teeth, rewinding, rewinding, rewinding, rewinding, just hitting rewind. Kobe is almost like Jordan. A lot of Jordan moves, fadeaway, fadeaway, head fake, head fake. Jab step, stop, pull up. Boom. Or I\u2019m gonna take you to the hole and dunk. The only time I\u2019m gonna shoot this 3 is when it\u2019s low clock, catch-and-shoot or swing-swing. I was starting to notice how he was trying to simplify his game just to get 20 points. I knew when he was going to try to be aggressive. I would look at the points on the scoreboard. I\u2019d be like, \u201cAlright, this man\u2019s got 10 points coming into the half. He\u2019s for sure about to shoot the skin off this [expletive] (laughing).\u201d For him to acknowledge that I was one of the best defenders to guard him, man, he probably was the only guy that I would fall asleep watching film on. How did it make you feel to know that the Memphis Grizzlies planned on retiring your jersey ? I ain\u2019t gonna lie, I got kind of emotional at the time they brought me the news. I can\u2019t front. As it soaked in, I got to thinking more and more about everything I did just to prepare, from rehab to strength and conditioning, long nights in the gym, battling in practice, keying in on my opponents and all the homework in that, just the blood, sweat and tears in that grind, in that jersey and all that. They showed a lot of love. It had me teary, man. It was one of those really emotional moments because I was in the locker room with some good dudes, had some good coaches, some real big personalities. We changed the whole narrative to \u201cgrit and grind\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t bluff.\u201d Before you knew it, teams were scared to see us and match up with us in the playoffs. It just shows what we embodied. Speaking of that, you were the embodiment of an entire era of Memphis Grizzlies basketball. You\u2019re the Grindfather. \u201cAll heart. Grit. Grind.\u201d When you said those words in 2011 after a win against the Oklahoma City Thunder, did you think they would start an entire movement and galvanize the city the way they did? I was out there playing because the starter wasn\u2019t playing, and I felt that this was my time to show out because I didn\u2019t have nothing to lose. I played upset and that interview wouldn\u2019t have come out like that if I\u2019m not upset. I was just upset. I ain\u2019t gonna lie, when I was playing for the Celtics, you felt like it was a sure win when you had the Grizzlies on the schedule. But later on, it became like, \u201cDamn, we\u2019ve got Memphis.\u201d But let me just tell you this: All heart, grit, grind is a movement. First things first: Ain\u2019t nobody giving Memphis nothing. You\u2019ve got to go get what you\u2019re gonna get, period. And that\u2019s how we had to break through. Like, alright, we\u2019re going to maul everybody on the defensive end, and we\u2019re gonna pound them on the block. That\u2019s how we\u2019re rocking. That\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna win our games. But now, we\u2019ve got the uptempo style of play. But even now, you can\u2019t go away from what held your fort down for that whole time, for that like seven-year period. Why would you go away from your DNA? You can\u2019t, it\u2019s still going to have to be within you. A lot of young players, even now, ask for pointers on certain guys, and I talk to them and give them my insight. That\u2019s Tony Allen man. That\u2019s just me. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here  , find his archive  here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

A couple of years ago, uncertainty might have been something that stressed him out, triggered the sorts of feelings like the ones that manifested themselves in the form of an in-game panic attack in 2017, rendered him unable to compete as efficiently as he wanted. Not this time. Even though he has three full years and about $90 million left on his contract after this season, it\u2019s no secret that Love could be traded by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Plenty of teams even make sense for such a move \u2013 Portland, Dallas, Denver, Miami among others. But going public with the details of his panic attack \u2013 and his ongoing involvement in the conversation about the need to take care of mental health \u2013 has not left Love feeling vulnerable. He\u2019s more at peace than anything else, and that\u2019s why the rumors that are out there aren\u2019t gnawing at him. \u201dI\u2019m just going to let the chips fall,\u201d Love said. \u201dI know that this is a young team. I think I can help them. I\u2019m going to do right by Cleveland, the organization. This is a league where teams want to rebuild, teams want to go young but certain teams are looking for a piece, a guy who\u2019s played in the Finals, a guy who has playoff experience. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I think it definitely lessens the burden and the anxiety.\u201d Cleveland is 5-12 and Love missed Monday\u2019s game against Brooklyn with back issues.

But Love insists that he isn\u2019t forcing a change. \u201dI\u2019ve been committed to Cleveland since Day 1,\u201d Love said. \u201dI know it\u2019s been a little shaky at some points. It\u2019s been really great at some points.

Embiid shot 0-for-11 (including 0-for-4 on 3-poiners), was 0-for-3 on free throws and had 13 rebounds in the loss to Toronto . \u201cI can\u2019t have this type of production,\u201d Embiid told the Philadelphia Inquirer . \u201cI would have never thought I would be here talking about zero points in an NBA game. But it is what it is. Some nights you make shots, some nights you don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s just one of several strange performances from the player many believed to be the best center in the league. Embiid simply isn\u2019t playing to last season\u2019s level, when he averaged career highs in points (27.5), rebounds (13.6), assists (3.7) and minutes (33.7) in leading the Sixers to the Eastern Conference semifinals . His production to date \u2013 21.7 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 2.9 apg in 29.7 mpg \u2014 is a head-scratching dip for a player who has the tools to be the NBA\u2019s most physically dominant player. It also explains why Embiid has been noticeably absent from the top 10 of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder in recent weeks. The Sixers remain one of the top teams in the league \u2014 at least in theory. They have the size, defensive prowess and talent to challenge for a title. But it\u2019s hard to see them as a legitimate title contender without Embiid playing better. Who made Magic\u2019s list?: Even Magic Johnson is diving in on the MVP fun these days \u2026 He\u2019s on one: The OG, TuffJuice (aka Caron Butler) himself, gave a shout out to the work being done by Wizards guard Bradley Beal . He would be on anyone\u2019s MVP top 10 list if his work wasn\u2019t being done in vain. Players of the week: Luka Doncic earning Western Conference Player of the Week honors was no surprise. He\u2019s been shredding the competition for weeks. His Eastern Conference counterpart, Brooklyn\u2019s Spencer Dinwiddie, found his groove in a 3-1 week. That had to make Nets fans feel good with Kyrie Irving out of the lineup. Dinwiddie was at his clutch best against the Cavs, drilling an elbow jumper with 1.9 seconds left to seal the Nets\u2019 fourth straight win. It was his second career game-winner in the last five seconds of a game. Dinwiddie, Irving and Caris LeVert must all work together this season if the Nets are going to solidify themselves as a playoff squad. Now, let\u2019s get into your comments about last week\u2019s  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  \u017deljko Puhari\u0107 Nov. 23, 2019 | 9:41 a.m. Dear Sekou, Greetings from Croatia. My man Kevin Durant is out, but some pretty good guys are still there. Luka Doncic \u2013 who\u2019s from my neighborhood \u2014 or Kawhi Leonard or \u201cThe Beard\u201d as usual are in the mix. LeBron is like old wine but not good enough for a second place spot on the MVP list. To me, he\u2019s not even amongst the three best players at the moment. Sorry, LBJ, but time is running for all of us. And here\u2019s a suggestion for the MVP award: it must be for the season and playoffs (remember last year\u2019s Giannis or even Harden compared to Durant or Leonard in the playoffs?) and there should be one MVP for The Finals. * * * My response: Some things translate easily, Zeljko. And trust me, LeBron is all in on the fine wine reference (he popped the cork on a 33-point, 14-rebound gem as the Lakers won their eighth straight game Monday night). I\u2019d respectfully disagree with you about him not belonging in the top three of the chase right now, though. As for the suggestion that we only have one MVP award encompassing both the regular and postseason, we covered that ground previously . Fair points were raised. Still, I can\u2019t imagine things changing any time soon. And a hat tip to you and all the NBA fans in Croatia. From:  David Spahr Nov. 22  , 2019 | 4:51 p.m. The list looks pretty spot on now. * * * My response: I\u2019ll sleep better this holiday season David knowing you approve. From:  J.A. Diaz Nov. 23, 2019 | 4:41 a.m. \ufeff How can you possibly have Anthony Davis any lower than 6th? His two-way play this season is just studly. Even on non-stat plays he impacts opposing players\u2019 drives to the hole. You might wanna watch his defense a bit closer. I have him 2nd in defensive POY race. * * * My response: You bring up a great point, J.A., where AD\u2019s two-way play is concerned. Few in the NBA do it better on both ends. The hiccup, for me, comes in the form of trying to decide whose play is more critical to the Lakers\u2019 bottom line: LeBron\u2019s or AD\u2019s? That\u2019s the real dilemma where MVP consideration is concerned. From:  Landon Bangerter Nov. 22, 2019 | 11:07 a.m. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Love the list as always, Sekou. And I love that you respond to our emails and tweets. It makes things much more interesting. I agree with mostly the top 4 , and some scatter shots here and there. But I do think there are a few players that we need to consider: Eric Bledsoe: With the No. 1 slot in the East for Milwaukee, Bledsoe hasn\u2019t missed a single game and is at 17.3 ppg, 5.2 rpg and 5.2 apg \u2014 all great numbers, as he\u2019s aiding \u201cThe Greek Freak.\u201d He should be considered. Jayson Tatum: Again, likely overshadowed by the best player on his team, but Tatum also hasn\u2019t missed a game for Boston. He\u2019s at 20.5 ppg and 6.9 rpg and certainly warrants a spot in the Ladder conversation. Lou Williams: I remember you talking about how fantastic sixth men like Williams should not be a part of the MVP conversation should not be. I disagree. I think as a sixth man, you can be just as valuable on your team as any starter. Williams is the Clippers\u2019 MVP so far this season. It would\u2019ve been Leonard, but the man has load management issues. And that\u2019s the biggest thing I disagree with you on. Leonard is way too high, considering that he\u2019s missed two of the Clippers\u2019 wins, and Williams has been phenomenal for them and hasn\u2019t missed a game. Hence why Williams (and Montrezl Harrell, frankly) are in my MVP convo. With that said, here\u2019s my personal MVP ladder update: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) 2. James Harden (Houston Rockets) 3. Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers) 4. LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) 5. Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) 6. Kemba Walker (Boston Celtics) 7. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors) 8. Eric Bledsoe (Milwaukee Bucks) 9. Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics) 10. Lou Williams (LA Clippers) And five more:Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat), Montrezl Harrell (Los Angeles Clippers), Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers), Donovan Mitchell (Utah Jazz), Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves) Keep up the good work as usual, Sekou! * * * My response: You keep this up, Landon, and we\u2019re going to be old school hoops pen pals. Seriously, I appreciate the feedback and your willingness to put yourself out there on a consistent basis. But I should warn you, there are quite a few people who won\u2019t be happy to see where you have Luka on your list. Just saying \u2026 * * * From:  Rafael Testai Nov. 24, 2019 | 1:43 p.m. LeBron James is still the most athletic player in the NBA. * * * My response: I don\u2019t know if he can claim that anymore, not with 35 just around the corner. But he\u2019s still up there. And he\u2019s maintained his elite athleticism longer than should be allowed. He has it in flashes now as opposed to in 30-minute intervals. But you\u2019re not far off in your assessment. From:  Marko M. Nov. 22, 2019 | 7:41 p.m. Luka ahead of Harden? * * * My response: Doesn\u2019t look so crazy after Sunday night, does it? From: Janez Nov. 25, 2019 | 7:36 a.m. As a 20+yrs Slovenian Spurs fan it\u2019s tough right now. I basically root for a Luka Doncic triple double every night and a Mavericks loss by one point \u2026 Seriously though Go Spurs Go! and fair play to you Dallas \u2013 enjoy your success. * * * My response: You can\u2019t lose, Janez. The Spurs have been legit your entire life and now you get Luka. From:   Max Steves Nov. 22, 2019 | 8:38 p.m. I am not a Mavs. Fan. never have been because of Mark Cuban. But the Mavs have the MVP for this Season \u2014 the 20 year old, LUKA DONCIC! * * * My response: The greatest success in Mavericks history has come on Mark Cuban\u2019s watch, so I have a hard time with anyone taking unnecessary shots at a guy who has done what he has during his time owning the team. As for your second part, we shall see. From:   Daniel Fripp Nov. 24, 2019 | 6:06 p.m. Can you stop pretending Luka Doncic doesn\u2019t exist? How is he not the top player on your list? * * * My response: Since when does a top 3 spot equate to acting like the man doesn\u2019t exist?  From:   Ggs Nov. 22, 2019 | 7:47 p.m. The man is averaging 39 ppg and brought his team on a 8-game win streak out the slump they had. * * * My response: There are two sides to the game. Scoring isn\u2019t everything. It\u2019s a huge part of it and the part Harden does better than anyone else. But he\u2019s in the thick of things will guys who are arguably much, much better two way players (save for Luka, who is every bit the impact on the Mavericks that Harden is having on the Rockets this season). * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

It\u2019s now Anthony Davis\u2019 turn and you can best believe the celebration Wednesday night in New Orleans ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) won\u2019t exactly be on a Mardi Gras level. That\u2019s one way to look at it. Here\u2019s another: If the former home city is booing, it\u2019s usually because you were great and they miss you, and in this particular case, both apply. The player who demanded a trade from the Pelicans just days before last February\u2019s deadline (it didn\u2019t happen) and insensitively wore a \u201cThat\u2019s All, Folks\u201d t-shirt to his final home game last season will certainly hear it when he takes the floor with the Lakers. There\u2019s a flip side, however: Davis is a smash hit in Los Angeles and, taking it a bit further, might be having the best debut so far among the swarm of top players who changed teams last offseason. It was an epic summer from both a numbers and notable standpoint, one that changed the NBA landscape and arguably was more interesting than anything else that happened in the 2018-19 season, including The Finals. Davis was one of the kingpins in the Great Jersey Switch when the Pelicans were essentially forced to send him to the Lakers and the impact on both franchises has been stark as expected: The Lakers own the NBA\u2019s best record and the Pelicans are struggling as they weather the temporary loss of rookie Zion Williamson to injury and incorporate a roster of new players. An argument could be made that Davis has been the best offseason acquisition from both a player and team standpoint. The Lakers are winning and Davis is producing , averaging 25.1 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. Of course, with the season not even 20 games old, this is a small sample size. But the standard of Davis has been set for others to reach or surpass. Here\u2019s a look at others who changed teams through trades or free agency and their impact so far \u2014 and not all have been for the better: Sure, there\u2019s always suspense whenever the Clippers issue their pre-game injury list to see if Kawhi\u2019s name appears. But when he isn\u2019t on load management or resting an aching knee, Kawhi has been everything the Clippers imagined: He\u2019s averaging 25.7 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 5.5 rpg and 2.1 spg, supplying defense and inspiring teammates with his work ethic. To paraphrase the great philosopher Drake: \u201cHe go zero to a hundred real quick.\u201d When he returned after missing the first 11 games of the season due to summer shoulder surgery, George didn\u2019t take long to reach peak level. Like, maybe a few seconds. George scored 70 points in his first 44 minutes and beat his former team, OKC, on the game-winning shot . The chemistry between him and Leonard is starting to bubble. For those who are quick to say he isn\u2019t Kyrie Irving, please clarify: from a talent or drama standpoint? Perhaps both are true and the Celtics are thrilled with the latter and more than comfortable with the former. The switch in starting point guards is benefitting Boston so far: Walker is averaging 21.1 ppg, shooting 38.9% on 3-pointers and getting zero eye rolls in the locker room. He left a winning Philly team to awaken a Miami franchise. So far J-Buckets is rubbing off in a good way with the Heat by scoring (18.9 ppg), rebounding, defending the toughest opponents and inspiring his teammates. Of course, given his history of being quirky in his last three NBA stops, the only wonder is how long the good vibes will last. More than a few NBA people were surprised how much the small-market Pacers paid (four years, $85 million) for a player who shared the point guard position in Milwaukee. And yet, Brogdon is already a solid value by keeping the Pacers in the hunt with premier overall play and making Indiana fans salivate about the backcourt tandem once Victor Oladipo returns from injury. Celtics fans have another reason to be miffed, now that an injury will prevent Irving from suiting up in his return to Boston ( 7 ET, ESPN ) and therefore denying the TD Garden the chance to express its feelings toward the traitorous star. Well, at least the Celtics are above the Nets in the standings, and Brooklyn \u2014 while appreciating Kyrie\u2019s 28.5 ppg, 7.2 apg and 5.4 rpg \u2014 is craving the Other Addition (a guy named Kevin Durant) a bit more. His numbers \u2014 from shooting percentage to scoring average to assists per game \u2014 are down across the board. To an extent, this can be expected once you ride shotgun with James Harden. And it\u2019s not as if Russ is suddenly a slouch; he commands attention and continues to attack constantly. But at age 31 and with a game that\u2019s fueled mainly by energy, is his best ball already in the rear view? Might be. He probably has pole position for Kia Most Improved Player honors because it appears Ingram is about to have a career-changing season. Raise your hand if you thought he\u2019d be No. 8 among NBA scorers at 26.1 ppg (on 50.6% shooting!). With minutes and shots suddenly plentiful in New Orleans, Ingram is making the most of this chance, much more than his fellow ex-Laker, Lonzo Ball. The question is how will Ingram adjust once Williamson returns and assumes the driver\u2019s seat. Yes, he\u2019s still with the Warriors, and absolutely, he\u2019s crushing it when healthy. In fact, with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson perhaps done for the season, Russell is Golden State\u2019s most proven generator of buckets. It remains to be seen, however, whether he\u2019s just passing through San Francisco or if he\u2019s projected as one-third of the Warriors\u2019 three-guard rotation next season. And that all depends on if the Warriors\u2019 front office feels D-Loading is part of the reloading plans. Few managed to leverage themselves and cash in quite like Horford did last summer, when he navigated out of Boston and banked $109 million over four years with the Sixers. Since then, it\u2019s been typical Horford: being a good teammate by complimenting Joel Embiid on the front line and providing leadership. Still, at his price, the Sixers need to cash in this year with a guy who turns 34 next summer before the inevitable slide begins.  He owns the longest last name in NBA history, but the curve on the back of his jersey isn\u2019t as attractive as his learning curve. In Year Two of his career, the player formally known as SGA has nearly doubled his scoring average (now 19.3 ppg) and is giving OKC a player for the future. That\u2019s important for a franchise that not only is rebuilding, but isn\u2019t exactly on the wish-list of the game\u2019s top free agents. Player development is key for the Thunder and SGA is their current pet project. Since arriving from Houston in a forced deal, Paul has played the good soldier. He\u2019s healthy, playing well at his advanced age and also mentoring the young players (including Gilgeous-Alexander). Still, deep within his competitive soul, being on a team in transition isn\u2019t his idea of hoop heaven. CP3 yearns for that elusive title and it won\u2019t happen in OKC anytime soon, but will a contender trade for an aging player on a massive super max contract? Likely, no. He has been the outside shooter Utah craved, averaging 20.9 ppg on 45.9% shooting from 3-point range in making defenses pay for collapsing whenever Donovan Mitchell attacks the rim. Even better, with Joe Ingles still struggling (34.5% shooting), Bogdanovic\u2019s range becomes even more important. He and Royce O\u2019Neale are the only reliable deep threats for the Jazz. His early struggles from the gate (37.3% shooting) have been the biggest surprise of all. It makes you wonder if Conley, after 12 seasons in Memphis, left his best there. Instead of sharing the load with Mitchell, Conley appears to be riding shotgun and embracing a supporting role instead. Nonetheless, the Jazz maintain confidence in Conley if only because the man has pride, works hard and is healthy. Not quite scary, yet fairly decent so far (17.4 ppg, 4.4 apg) for the Hornets, who stunned the league by paying a premium price (three years, $56 million) for a backup point guard in Boston. Yes, even at that rate, he came cheaper than Walker. The Hornets are no better off in the standings so far with Rozier and have actually turned the team over to their young players here in the throes of transition . * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It\u2019s Luka-mania vs. Kawhi & PG13!:  The NBA\u2019s newest walking triple-double (Luka Doncic) vs. perhaps the Western Conference\u2019s best two-way duo (Kawhi Leonard and Paul George)? Sign us up, please. Doncic enters tonight\u2019s home game ( 8:30 ET, NBA TV ) averaging a triple-double in November (32.5 points, 10.6 rebounds, 10.8 assists). Meanwhile, Leonard ranks No. 1 in the league in go-ahead field goals since the start of last season, and George has made four go-ahead 3-pointers in the final seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. Should this one get close, it will be interesting to see which superstar delivers. 2. Which style will prevail in Denver?:  Save for the Lakers, no team in the West has been hotter right now than the Nuggets. They host the Washington Wizards ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and seek their sixth straight win \u2014 many of which have come because of Denver\u2019s defense . That unit will have a tough task against the Wizards and their offense, which is No. 2 in the NBA in November. Pay attention to the shooting guard matchup, where Denver\u2019s Gary Harris will try to keep Bradley Beal under wraps. 3. Happy birthday, Reignman!: NBA fans of a certain generation remember all too well just how thrilling Shawn Kemp was to watch in his heyday. The former Seattle SuperSonics forward known as \u201cThe Reignman\u201d turns the big 5-0 today. Take a gander at Kemp\u2019s career mixtape that does justice in displaying just how amazing and athletic of a player he was in his prime."},{"id":30349,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gasol-keeps-embiid-check-once-again","date":"2019-11-26","title":"Marc Gasol keeps Joel Embiid in check once again","content":"Joel Embiid\u2019s struggles against Marc Gasol have been well documented, an embarrassing blip for the self-proclaimed \u201cmost unstoppable player in the league.\u201d Those woes continued Monday in Toronto, where Embiid suffered through the worst outing of his career as the Raptors surged late to beat the 76ers, 101-96 , in their first meeting since the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals , a seven-game classic in which Philadelphia\u2019s All-Star center shot just 37% overall. That was red hot compared to Monday\u2019s rematch, with Embiid failing to score for the first time in 171 career games while bricking 11 shots (three of which were 3-pointers) and three free throws. He became the first NBA player to miss at least 10 shots and two free throws in a scoreless game since Devean George in 2008. He is also believed to be the first NBA player to miss at least 10 shots and three free throws in a scoreless game since Arnie Risen in 1954. (Embiid is also the first player to go scoreless on an 0-for-11 night since \u2014 ironically enough \u2014 the Raptors\u2019 Antonio Davis did so against the Chicago Bulls on Feb. 17, 2004 .) Gasol was once again the impetus, using his size and savvy to frustrate Embiid while long-armed teammates like Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby hovered nearby, ready to swoop in with timely help. Embiid at one point attempted to overpower Gasol in the post and nearly knocked himself over in the process as the Spanish veteran stood firm. Embiid ranks eighth in the NBA with roughly 13 paint points per game, but only two of his shots came from that spot , with Gasol blocking both.  It continued an extended nightmare from which Embiid has yet to wake. In addition to last year\u2019s playoffs, he shot just 34.4% in five previous regular-season matchups with Gasol-led teams \u2014 roughly 14 percentage points below his career mark of 48.1%. While Embiid did grab 13 rebounds, the lack of scoring production from their leading scorer proved too much for the 76ers to overcome. In addition to going scoreless, Embiid committed four turnovers, including two in the final 2:35 as Philadelphia squandered a late six-point lead. Embiid typically isn\u2019t shy about letting opponents know when things are going his way. He was equally ready to accept blame for yet another poor performance against the gritty Gasol. \u201cI can\u2019t have this type of production,\u201d said Embiid, who denied fatigue was a factor in Philadelphia\u2019s third game in five nights. \u201cI would have never thought I would be here talking about zero points in an NBA game, but it is what it is. Some nights you make shots, some nights you don\u2019t. Some nights you\u2019re hot, some nights you\u2019re cold.\u201d Said Sixers coach Brett Brown, \u201cI think you give Marc Gasol, a former Defensive Player of the Year, credit. He\u2019s good.

The night before, Kawhi Leonard faces Luka Doncic on NBA TV as one of just two games set to be played around the league. Here, we take a look at five of this week\u2019s most intriguing head-to-head battles: Last regular season meeting: Nov. 3, 2019 The struggling San Antonio Spurs desperately need a boost in production from Aldridge, who has shown at times over the years a penchant for carrying his team when it sputters. The Lakers capped last week with their seventh consecutive victory, while the Spurs snapped their longest losing skid (eight games) of the Gregg Popovich era behind a 23-point effort from Aldridge. For the majority of the season, Aldridge, like the rest of the Spurs, has been wildly inconsistent. Aldridge\u2019s team has fallen in each of its last two matchups with Davis. Davis lit up the Spurs for 25 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks the last time he faced Aldridge, who managed just eight points on 2-of-9 shooting in 30 minutes on Nov. 3 . While Aldridge owns a 13-10 record in this series, Davis served as a member of the New Orleans Pelicans for the first 22 matchups. Davis now plays with a much more potent supporting cast and the Lakers enter the week 6-1 on the road. Meanwhile, Aldridge and the Spurs continue to tinker with different lineups to find the right mix. Defense remains a major flaw for San Antonio as it is 26th in Defensive Rating while L.A. is 5th in that category . Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Jan. 27, 2019 It\u2019s early, but Doncic has more games (seven) with 30-plus points and 10-plus assists than anybody else in the league this season. Additionally, Doncic has eight games of 20-plus points and 10-plus assists, trailing only LeBron James (10 games) in that category. Still, Leonard clearly plays on a more loaded team. We saw evidence of that Friday night when Leonard and the Clippers handed Houston its second-straight loss after the Rockets had won eight straight. The Clippers feature not one or two, but three legitimate game closers in Leonard, Paul George and Lou Williams. Conversely, the Mavericks rely on Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis for the majority of their heavy lifting. Leonard and Doncic have faced off twice with the former winning both those games, averaging 27 points, 9.5 rebounds and four assists per game. But Doncic\u2019s statistics in these games (28.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 7.0 apg) have been superior, despite Leonard playing on a more talented team (Toronto) in these meetings. Nothing changes this time around with Leonard\u2019s new team. LA can throw Leonard, George or Patrick Beverley at Doncic, while the Mavs feature few options capable of limiting Leonard\u2019s production. This is one of just two games on the NBA schedule for the night, so it\u2019s definitely a much-watch. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Editor\u2019s note: Jimmy Butler was ruled out due to illness . Last regular season meeting: Nov. 3, 2019 Last summer, reports surfaced that Houston was eyeing Butler as a potential addition. But the transaction never panned out, and Butler joined the Heat to play a role in administering arguably the Rockets\u2019 most embarrassing loss of 2019-20 ( a 129-100 Miami romp on Nov. 3). The Heat entered the week having won five of their last six, while Houston reeled off eight wins in a row before dropping its next three (to the Denver Nuggets, LA Clippers and Dallas Mavericks) to close out last week. Harden averages 23.5 ppg and 6.3 apg in matchups against Butler, but those numbers pale in comparison to what he\u2019s done as of late. Entering Sunday, Harden had 613 points through 16 games. That ranked as the sixth-most in NBA history over that span \u2014 just behind Michael Jordan (615 points), Rick Barry (618) and Wilt Chamberlain, who owns the next three highest totals (861, 764, and 642). Houston undoubtedly will be out for revenge at home after its embarrassing loss to Miami three weeks ago. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: March 27, 2019 Five NBA seasons and five coaches for Booker, who might finally be on the verge of securing some stability under new coach Monty Williams. Booker and Co. ended their three-game skid on Saturday against the Minnesota Timberwolves and, to date, Booker is averaging 24.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg and 6.1 apg. He\u2019s also trending toward career highs in shooting percentage (51.8%) from the field and from 3-point range (42.9%). But Booker and the Suns haven\u2019t experienced much success against Beal and the Wizards. Beal is 6-1 in battles with Booker, averaging 33.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 4.6 apg. Booker has lost his last two matchups with Beal, despite dropping 50 points and 10 rebounds the last time the teams met. Beal had five straight games with 30 or more points working until that came to an end in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Sacramento Kings ( Beal had 20 points ). Phoenix\u2019s injury situation adds uncertainty to what should be a high-scoring affair and could put the Suns at a slight disadvantage, given it\u2019s still unknown whether strong supporting cast members such as Ricky Rubio (back) and Aron Baynes (hip) will be available for the Suns to help Booker. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Oct. 30, 2019  Don\u2019t let the losing streaks these teams are suffering turn you away from this matchup. The Thunder enter the week having dropped three in a row , while the Trail Blazers head into Monday in the midst of their second four-game skid of the season. But the current losing situations for both teams lend themselves to hunger, and these squads are led by two of the NBA\u2019s most competitive point guards. Beef between the two dates back to Paul\u2019s time as a Houston Rocket, but we might experience an added level of awkwardness now that Carmelo Anthony \u2014 a good friend of Paul\u2019s \u2014 is now a teammate of Lillard\u2019s. Paul owns a lopsided advantage in this series, having won 16 of the 21 head-to-head clashes. The guards have already met once this season , with Lillard coming out victorious in an outing in which they combined for 44 points on 12-of-29 shooting. Oklahoma City entered the week in 13th place in the West, with Portland lurking right behind at No. 14. These teams appear to be heading into what they\u2019d consider must-win territory. Also worth noting? The Thunder entered the week 0-4 in games decided by three points or less. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: Oct. 30, 2019 Interestingly, Young grew up a Thunder fan because his family became season ticket holders when the team moved from Seattle to Oklahoma City before the start of the 2008-09 season (which was Westbrook\u2019s rookie season). Young has known Westbrook dating all the way back to the Hawks star\u2019s high school days as a phenom in Norman, Okla. In fact, Young even expressed some disappointment about Westbrook being traded by Oklahoma City over the summer. While Oklahoma holds a special place in the heart of both players, this showdown takes place in Texas with the guards averaging a double-double against one another in two previous matchups. Young\u2019s squad walked away victorious the last time these players met during his rookie season. He had 24 points and 11 assists while Westbrook lit up the Hawks for 31 points and 11 assists in the loss. Westbrook finished that game with five steals in that game, and Young had seven turnovers. Look for Westbrook to try to impose his strength and quickness to see if he can force Young into turnovers that will allow Houston to get out in transition. Westbrook has also averaged three steals in these head-to-head battles. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Lakers in a zone out West: Los Angeles has won seven in a row, its longest winning streak since an 8-0 run to open the 2010-11 season. The Lakers\u2019 14-2 mark leads the NBA and as they visit San Antonio ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ), the Spurs have to deal with a tuned-in Anthony Davis. Good luck slowing him down, though, as he\u2019s not only leading the league in blocks ( 3 bpg ) but is also third among starting centers ( and 25th overall ) in steals per game (1.5). 2. Bucks trying to keep rolling:  Milwaukee\u2019s 2018-19 squad had a fantastic season, but this season\u2019s edition can do something tonight that team never did: win eight straight games. The Bucks have won 11 of their last 12 games, with the lone loss in that run coming on Nov. 8 in Utah. The Jazz pay a visit to Wisconsin ( 8 ET, NBA TV ) and face a Bucks defense that has been hot (101.3 Defensive Rating) since that loss in Salt Lake City. 3. A (sort-of) playoff rematch in Toronto: The last time the Sixers and Raptors met, it was Game 7 of the East semis . Much has changed since then (namely, Kawhi Leonard is now in L.A.), but one thing that hasn\u2019t is these teams being among the upper crust in the East. This reunion ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) has several new dynamics (Al Horford in Philly) and an X-factor or two ( Josh Richardson, anyone? ) in the mix. If nothing else, the Sixers want a win to end the Raptors\u2019 run of 13 straight regular-season home wins against them. 4. Shorthanded Celtics back at home: Boston went 2-3 on its recent road trip, with it nearly suffering a season-altering loss on Friday in Denver. Thankfully, star guard Kemba Walker only suffered a neck strain from his collision with teammate Semi Ojeleye . Walker won\u2019t play against Sacramento ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), which has won three of its last four and is climbing back toward respectability. Part of the Kings\u2019 resurgence is due to an offense that is No. 5 since Nov. 1 (111.6 Offensive Rating) after it ranked No. 28 prior to then . 5. An eye on the future \u2026:  We remember when Thunder-Warriors meant superstars galore. That\u2019s not so much the case this time around ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ). Still, there is a reason to watch in that young players on both squads will be showing how they\u2019re coming along 15 or so games into 2019-20. The two to watch are the Warriors\u2019 Eric Paschall and the Thunder\u2019s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Paschall leads all rookies in scoring and is among the best in several other categories, while Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s 19.7 ppg is a career-high for the second-year player.

Someone had managed to prevent Doncic from doing whatever he pleased. The Houston Rockets failed spectacularly earlier Sunday afternoon, letting Doncic drill them for 41 points and 10 assists in a 137-123 demolition at the Toyota Center. After five straight victories, Dallas is riding its longest winning streak since March of 2016. The dominating road win \u2014 over a team that a week prior captured eight consecutive triumphs of its own \u2014 might just reshape some thinking around the NBA about where the Mavericks stand in the conversation regarding Western Conference title contenders. Mostly, it put on display what everybody else already knew (with apologies to Paul Pierce): Doncic is the unadulterated truth. \u201cHe\u2019s just a great basketball player,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni after Houston\u2019s third consecutive loss. \u201cHe was great in Europe at age 16 or 17. And to be good that early in Europe is not easy. He knows how to play. He\u2019s got a big body. He\u2019s strong. He shoots 3\u2019s, and he\u2019s got a good stepback. He\u2019s got everything. You can see he loves to play. He\u2019s got a great future, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d The present doesn\u2019t look bad, either. Against the Rockets, Doncic produced his fourth consecutive game with 30 points or more and 10 or more assists, not to mention his second 40-point, 10-assist effort over that same span. Doncic had already become the youngest player in NBA history to tally three consecutive games with at least 30 points and 10 assists, and now joins James Harden and Russell Westbrook as the only active players to register four consecutive outings with those numbers. Already the second-youngest player in NBA history to score 30-plus points in four straight games (trailing only Kevin Durant), the 20-year-old Doncic is averaging 37 points, 8.5 rebounds and 11.8 assists on this current four-game tear, shooting 55.4% from the floor and 44.4% from 3-point range. \u201cWe allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do from the beginning of the game,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWhen you give a team like that comfort and the ability to do whatever they want, they gain confidence, and that\u2019s what they did.\u201d Dallas opened the game on a 16-4 run in the first three minutes, capped by the second of three stepback 3-pointers nailed by Doncic in the quarter. The former third overall pick opened with 11 points, while Kristaps Porzingis contributed 10 to go with eight rebounds as Dallas built a 45-29 lead after one.  The Mavericks led by as many as 16 points in the first quarter, before stifling every run the feisty Rockets made the rest of the way. Dallas entered the contest having constructed what Carlisle described as \u201ca complex game plan\u201d for stopping Harden, who led the Rockets with 32 points, but never found a rhythm. The Mavericks threw constant double-teams at him, resulting in six turnovers, an 11-of-24 showing from the field and 2-of-15 from 3-point range. Carlisle mentioned the players stuck with that game plan \u201cthrough thick and thin.\u201d \u201cWe knew they were going to make plenty of [runs],\u201d Carlisle added. \u201cI thought we were capable of coming in and having this kind of a game. But when you\u2019re on the road with great players and great coaching, they\u2019re going to keep coming at you, and they did. We just were able to finally get our bodies in front of them enough. \u201cFatigue was a factor for them. They had a tough trip back from LA, and their guys played a lot of minutes. So, I thought we outlasted them on a certain level. But I\u2019m very proud of the effort. Our defensive coaching staff did a great job of putting the game plan together. And our guys executed it well.\u201d Houston pulled within five points just seven-plus minutes from the finish, but Dallas responded with a 23-6 run over the next five minutes to restore a 22-point margin. \u201cWe know we\u2019re capable of doing this stuff, and we have to keep doing it like that,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI approach every game the same, just sometimes the shots will go in and sometimes they won\u2019t. Those matchups, they\u2019re big. Harden is one of the top three players in the league, so this was a big win for us. As I always say after every game [when] they ask about our team, I will say we have amazing players. I just know they\u2019re capable of doing this.\u201d Certainly, several of them proved it \u2014 most notably Tim Hardaway Jr. Making his third consecutive start after playing as a reserve over the first 13 games, Hardaway dialed up his first 30-point game (31 points) as a Maverick. \u201cHe was great again,\u201d Carlisle said of Hardaway. \u201cHe\u2019s giving us really great scoring punch and great defense, and a great floor game. He\u2019s an underrated passer. He\u2019s a connector out there. I really like what he\u2019s doing.\u201d In his last three starts, including Sunday, Hardaway Jr. has connected on 22-of-33 shots, including 13-of-20 from deep. \u201cOne of the goals is to maintain it,\u201d Hardaway said, \u201cand continue to take the pressure off big fella (Porzingis) and Luka.\u201d Although it\u2019s a small sample size, the Mavericks\u2019 current offensive rating of 117.4 ranks more than 3 points higher than any other team in the NBA. If they somehow maintain that over the course of the season, it would register as the best in league history. Doncic serves as the catalyst of it all, which is why Porzingis makes no bones about Dallas\u2019 hierarchy on the floor. \u201cLuka runs the show,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cWe all depend on him in most of the games. When he\u2019s out there, he\u2019s the main ballhandler. He\u2019s playing incredible right now, and he\u2019s getting us open looks. That\u2019s it. He\u2019s also learning each game how to find that balance where we let him do what he does, but also make sure that everybody\u2019s kind of involved, and we all have high energy throughout the game. He\u2019s thinking about it, and he\u2019s getting better at it.\u201d That should be cause for concern for the rest of the Western Conference, but nobody in Dallas is getting carried away.

LaVine, who was subbed out less than four minutes into Friday\u2019s loss to the Heat, canned a franchise-record 13 3-pointers in Chicago\u2019s 116-115 barnburner over the Hornets. The last three of his career-high 49 points were the most dramatic and least likely: a fadeaway 3 made possible only after Chicago stole the inbounds pass with Charlotte leading by two. LaVine\u2019s game-winner went down with just 0.8 seconds remaining, giving Chicago a dramatic win just 24 hours after postgame drama punctuated another poor start to the Bulls\u2019 season. Friday saw Chicago coach Jim Boylen replace LaVine after the Bulls fell behind 13-0. \u201cI thought he needed to come in and think about it,\u201d Boylen told reporters after the game. \u201cI felt there were some defensive mistakes that didn\u2019t need to be made. I thought he needed to come over and think about it for a minute.\u201d LaVine did not seem eager to agree. \u201cI guess I was to blame for it,\u201d he said noncomittally. \u201cI\u2019ve got pulled early before by him. I guess that\u2019s just his thing to do. You have to take it in stride. I\u2019m not the coach.\u201d Boylen likely had no issues with LaVine on hit a sizzling 13-of-17 from beyond the arc on Saturday (17-of-28 overall) in 35 minutes of action.

A person familiar with the negotiations said Saturday the NBA is working with the players\u2019 union and its teams on a plan to shorten the regular season, possibly to 78 games. They also are considering a change to the playoff seeding and the addition of a midyear tournament for all 30 clubs in time for the 2021-22 season. The tournament would likely be a way for teams to mitigate the loss of revenue from the shorter regular season and fewer home dates. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no update on the plan has been publicly given by the league. ESPN first reported the progression of the plan on Saturday. The proposal could be sent to the league\u2019s board of governors in April for discussion and possibly ratification. NBA broadcast partners ESPN and Turner Sports also are involved in the talks. ESPN also reported the proposal includes a plan to reseed the playoffs after early rounds, potentially creating an NBA Finals between teams from the same conference. The notion of adding a midseason tournament has been something Silver has batted around since at least 2016, drawing the parallel to how such events are customary in European soccer. \u201cIt would need to be negotiated with the Players Association,\u201d Silver said this year. \u201cI\u2019ve had very general discussions with (union executive director) Michele Roberts about the notion that these are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking at. I think she, of course, is supportive of looking at any ideas we have to build the business over time.\u201d The same applies to having a play-in playoff round, which Silver has said he supports. That idea has even reached the proposal stage, reviewed by the league\u2019s competition committee and others. The possibility of changing the playoff seeding has been talked about for some time as well. But the drawback to any shortening of the schedule \u2014 and perhaps fewer home games \u2014 is a decrease in revenue, which everyone would want to avoid. That\u2019s where the tournament comes into play, especially since it would involve all teams."},{"id":30415,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/celtics-marcus-smart-fan-incident","date":"2019-11-23","title":"Celtics' Smart unhappy with response to Denver fan incident","content":" The NBA is investigating an incident between Boston guard Marcus Smart and a fan in Denver, after the Celtics guard said he heard a derogatory comment and was unhappy with the way that he believed security in the arena responded to the matter. Smart said a fan told him to \u201cget on your knees\u201d after he pursued a loose ball along the sideline during Friday\u2019s game in Denver. Smart said one of his feet got tangled in frame of a courtside chair, and while he was trying to free himself he heard the comment. NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Saturday the league is investigating the matter. \u201cThe fan told me, `That\u2019s right, stay on the ground, get on your knees,\u201d\u2018 Smart told reporters postgame Friday night. \u201cExcuse me? I just told him, \u2018Listen, just watch the game because if we retaliate to you guys and if we were on the street, I guarantee you wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d Smart said security at Denver\u2019s Pepsi Center essentially ignored him. At least one security guard was seen speaking to fans in that section moments after the fourth-quarter incident, but it was unclear if any further action was taken. \u201cI told them who it was,\u201d Smart said. \u201cThey just looked at him and didn\u2019t even say anything to him, didn\u2019t even get him out of the game. Probably if I was a superstar, they probably would have did something but it is what it is. We\u2019re going to end up protecting ourselves eventually and it\u2019s not going to be pretty for those fans and we don\u2019t want that. The league doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d The incident is just the latest in several derogatory exchanges that have caught the NBA\u2019s attention in recent months. Russell Westbrook, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry and others were involved in such incidents last season, prompting the NBA to say that it wants arena security personnel to have zero tolerance for abusive or hateful behavior. Last season, Westbrook and Cousins were subjected to racist taunts in Salt Lake City and Boston and the fans involved in those incidents were banned by the Jazz and Celtics. Lowry was shoved by a minority partner of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 ownership group, seated courtside during the NBA Finals, and that person was banned from team business for a year by the league. The league has not released exact numbers of how many fans have been ejected for such incidents. But after a number of players met with the NBA this past offseason to air their concerns about safety and fan behavior, the league expanded the area in arenas most closely monitored when it comes to player-fan interaction. The top-priority area used to be just those seated with feet on the court itself or maybe the first couple rows of courtside seats; now, that area goes several rows deep in every building, plus the areas where teams and referees enter and exit the court. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem in the league that we\u2019ve got to fix,\u201d Smart said. \u201cIf we retaliate to protect ourselves, we\u2019re the ones getting in trouble. They\u2019re not. And that\u2019s not right. \u2026 There\u2019s nowhere in this league for it.\u201d This is not the first incident between Smart and a fan. In 2014, when he was playing for Oklahoma State, Smart was suspended three games for shoving a Texas Tech fan after a play where he crashed into some baseline seats following a blocked shot. Smart got up, then turned around and exchanged words with the fan before giving him a two-handed shove. Smart later apologized, and said it was \u201ca lesson I\u2019ll have to learn from.\u201d"},{"id":30445,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/suns-ready-prove-mettle","date":"2019-11-23","title":"Suns look to prove themselves after early-season buzz cools down","content":" Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams challenged his squad Thursday night in the wake of a third consecutive loss, falling 124-121 to the New Orleans Pelicans. \u201cI told our guys, \u2018Look, we had a nice run. We got hit in the mouth with injuries. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re made of,\u2019\u201d he said. Phoenix caught the basketball world by surprise early this season with a 5-2 start, which included wins over the LA Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers, but the Suns have since fallen on hard times. Having lost three consecutive games, in part due to injuries to point guard Ricky Rubio (back) and center Aron Baynes (hip) altering the club\u2019s style of play, the early-season buzz generated by the team is gone. But the truth is we haven\u2019t seen the Suns at full strength since their season-opening 124-95 win over the Sacramento Kings, a game in which Deandre Ayton registered a double-double (18 points and 11 rebounds) along with four blocks in his only game this season. Ayton received a 25-game suspension by the league after that game for violating the NBA\/NBPA anti-drug policy for testing positive for a diuretic. Ayton won\u2019t be eligible to return to action until Dec. 17, when Phoenix meets the LA Clippers at the Staples Center. So, it\u2019s tough to gauge at this point whether the Suns are indeed the real deal. But Williams isn\u2019t concerned. He prefers that the Suns fly under the radar. \u201cThe buzz will die down a bit, and now we can just focus on getting better,\u201d Williams told his team after Thursday\u2019s loss. \u201cThis is the NBA. Our guys are more than able to do what they need to do to get better.\u201d The Suns aren\u2019t sure when Rubio and Baynes will be set to return to action. Rubio has missed two of the team\u2019s last three games, and when he tried to play Tuesday at Sacramento, the point guard could only will himself through 16 minutes in the first half, shooting 0-for-7 from the field. Baynes has missed two games in a row with Phoenix mired in its first three-game skid of the season. Two of Phoenix\u2019s last three losses came by single-digit margins. \u201cThis is kind of our first time hitting adversity, losing three in a row, and now we\u2019re on the road for two tough games back to back, so we\u2019re going to see how we\u2019re going to go out there and play,\u201d said Mikal Bridges, who contributed 12 points to go with six rebounds and three steals in the loss to New Orleans. \u201cI think we\u2019re mentally strong, and we\u2019re together as a team. So, I think we\u2019re going to push through and play hard the next few games, and try to leave out of there with a W. But it\u2019s going to test our mentality to see what we\u2019re going to be right now.\u201d The Suns have struggled defensively over the past two games, most notably at defending the 3-point line. Sacramento knocked down 41.9% from deep on Tuesday against the Suns, while the Pelicans on Thursday hit on 45.7% from range. Baynes had been filling in during Ayton\u2019s suspension, but Frank Kaminsky has replaced Baynes the last two games as he\u2019s dealt with a strained right hip flexor. Going into the loss to New Orleans, Kaminsky (hip) was listed on the injury report along with Dario Saric (knee) and Cam Johnson (knee). Williams said \u201cyou hope\u201d Rubio and Baynes return for the start of Phoenix\u2019s upcoming back-to-back set on the road that starts Saturday in Minnesota and concludes Sunday at Denver. But the team has \u201cgot to start planning as if they\u2019re not,\u201d Williams said. Those contests wrap up a stretch of five games in seven nights. \u201cIt\u2019s next man up mentality,\u201d said guard Devin Booker, who has connected on 50% or better from the field in 11 of the team\u2019s 14 games. \u201c We\u2019re dealing with a couple injuries right now, and for guys to come in who have just been on the practice court the whole season and get an opportunity to perform it\u2019s a very big time. It\u2019s professionalism at its finest. It says a lot about a person\u2019s character.\u201d As for Ayton, who anxiously awaits his return for suspension, the center can only watch and wait. Provisions of the suspension allow Ayton to practice and travel with the team, but he can\u2019t be in an arena \u2014 home or away \u2014 two hours before game. During the down time, Ayton has been working to refine his shot; most notably his 3-point shot with Suns assistant Mark Bryant. After this latest road trek, the Suns come back home to host Washington and Dallas before hitting the road for four consecutive outings over five nights to start the month of December. So surely, there\u2019s more adversity to come for the young, upstart Suns. \u201cWe don\u2019t quit. We compete,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our values, our core values. We compete every possession. Sometimes, you can\u2019t always dictate whether the ball goes in, but you can compete every night. I always tell the guys if you do the right thing it will come back to you. It may not come back to you in this game, but over the long haul, you\u2019ll be better for it.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Warriors players boarded their team bus. Salt Lake City police Lt. Carlos Valencia said he received a call about the package from an officer working part-time at the game around 9:30 p.m. Valencia said the suspicious package looked like a shoebox and was discovered under a table behind a restaurant in the northeast corner of the arena. With that information, my next step was to call the bomb squad to have them come out, secure, and render the suspicious package safe, he said. From what I was told by the officers, was that the arena K-9 bomb dogs got a hit on the package. By the time I arrived, they had already secured the area. Valencia said the sellout crowd was already starting to leave when the evacuation began. We wanted to take all precautions necessary because public safety is paramount to us,\u201d he said. In a statement, the Jazz said Salt Lake City police issued an all-clear at 11:32 p.m., and employees were permitted to re-enter the building to prepare for Saturday nights Jazz home game. Guest safety is the top priority at Vivint Smart Home Arena. At the conclusion of the Utah Jazz-Golden State game, an employee noticed an unattended package on the main concourse. Upon further examination, it was concluded that we would enact our emergency action plan. Security was promptly alerted and guests were diverted away from the area and cleared from the arena.

Of the 58 players selected that night, only three are currently active. The first is LeBron James, tearing it up for the Los Angeles Lakers at a Kia MVP-worthy level. The second is Kyle Korver, a career sniper now playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. The third is Carmelo Anthony, back in the NBA after signing with the Portland Trail Blazers. The rest of that Class of 2003 reads like some combination of an NBA Who\u2019s Who and a bunch of dearly departed trivia answers. One, Luke Walton, has been an NBA coach for four seasons now. Another, James Jones, is Phoenix\u2019s general manager. Then there\u2019s Anthony, back at age 35 after an unplanned year\u2019s hiatus, hoping to craft a better ending. His send-off by Houston last autumn didn\u2019t suit Anthony at all. First the Rockets benched him, unwilling or unable to work the 10-time All-Star into their pecking order behind James Harden and Chris Paul. Anthony already had parted badly with the Oklahoma City Thunder after one mediocre season there, heading to Atlanta in a massive, three-team trade. The Hawks waived him five days later. After he got in Houston\u2019s doghouse, Anthony was left to twist in the wind for more than two months until the Rockets shipped him to Chicago in some financial housecleaning. The Bulls, who had wooed Anthony in free agency years earlier, cut him loose after a week. During and after all this, Anthony kept working out with his trainer, sometimes scrimmaging with current or former NBA players in the summer and getting up shots at a New York gym . The Blazers and Anthony are two games into this union now. Anthony scored 10 points with four rebounds Tuesday in New Orleans , then upped his numbers to 18 points and seven rebounds Thursday at Milwaukee . He has made 10 of 24 shots (41.7%) and is 5-for-8 on 3-pointers. He has started both nights, and Portland is 0-2. Obviously, it\u2019s too soon to know what sort of impact Anthony will have on the fading Blazers, who fell to 5-11 after Thursday\u2019s loss. Likewise, it\u2019s not fair yet to judge what this opportunity will mean for Anthony. Even a likely Hall of Famer, one of the most hungry and prolific scorers in recent history, deserves more than a couple games to get his legs, play himself into NBA shape and learn his new team and teammates. \u201cIt was just kind of more relaxed,\u201d Anthony said, comparing Thursday\u2019s experience to his debut 48 hours earlier. \u201cMore finding that pace, finding that rhythm. Learning how to play with the guys on the team. Learning how to play in this system. And where to be on the court. Those things are still going to take some time. But for the most part, it\u2019s playing basketball, making reads and just using my instinct.\u201d Anthony\u2019s supporters and detractors both had plenty to chew on in the Bucks game. He can still make shots and has a nose for the ball when he or one of his teammates misses. But he\u2019s moving, well, like a 35-year-old who hasn\u2019t played in a year. He has little lift. Defensively, his spirit wasn\u2019t very willing even when his flesh wasn\u2019t so weak. The analytics in both OKC and Houston showed him to be a significant liability on that end. It had been nearly 23 months since Anthony last faced the Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo, who crammed the box score with 24 points, 19 rebounds and 15 assists. A rather considerable torch got passed in the older player\u2019s absence. The league to which Anthony has returned is faster and more athletic still, and he knows it. It remains impossible to separate Anthony from his Draft class considering how big a role \u2014 good and bad \u2014 they\u2019ve played in his career. First, there was Darko Milicic, the No. 2 pick-turned-Draft-bust taken ahead of Anthony. The Detroit Pistons and boss Joe Dumars have paid for that reach several times over, but it remains an open question how Anthony\u2019s career might have played out differently had he been the rookie added to the Pistons\u2019 2004 NBA championship squad. Then it was James and Wade (and eventually Chris Bosh) \u2014 Anthony\u2019s banana-boat buddies \u2014 finding championship success in Miami while he settled for fat contracts, individual acclaim and way more criticism. He was so eager to get from Denver to New York in 2011 that he didn\u2019t object to how the sign-and-trade deal stripped the Knicks of helpful pieces. In the free-agent frenzy of 2014, when James went back to Cleveland from Miami, Anthony locked in again with the Knicks for the biggest possible payday . All along, Anthony seemed to consider himself the equal of, or a close second to, James in status and brilliance. Yet today, James (three rings), Dwyane Wade (three) and Bosh (two) have done all the winning. Anthony? He\u2019s done the earning, nearly $260 million in his career. His deal with Portland will add another $2.1 million, assuming he\u2019s still on the roster after Jan. 10. These days, Anthony is as proud of his Draft class as ever, regardless of their varied outcomes. \u201cFor one, I think we were the best,\u201d he said with a smile Thursday morning, after Portland\u2019s shootaround. \u201cI have to say that \u2014 no disrespect to \u201996 or the other classes. I\u2019m a little biased.\u201d Anthony \u2014 who appears to be in excellent shape despite his layoff \u2014 talked a bit about modern training, and its role in extending careers. \u201cWhat LeBron is doing is incredible. But that\u2019s just a testament to the work he puts in, the work he puts in on his body, the work he puts in on his mind,\u201d he said. \u201cNowadays, with age right now, that goes out the window. If this was years ago, if somebody was 33, 34, 35, you\u2019d think, oh, he\u2019s old. But I think it\u2019s a mental thing, if you\u2019re putting in the work you need to do to take care of yourself.\u201d New teammates and familiar opponents seem happy that Anthony is back. There\u2019s universal appeal to denying or delaying Father Time, the reaper they\u2019ll all eventually face. Blazers coach Terry Stotts went so far as to say Thursday that this chance might \u201cjump-start his career again,\u201d though a shorter run might be fine, too. \u201cWhether that\u2019s in sports, but no matter the profession, you kind of want it to end on your terms,\u201d Stotts said. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It\u2019s Week 5, the 2019-20 NBA season is about 17% complete, and league-wide numbers tell us that offense is down. Only five of the league\u2019s 30 teams have scored more points per 100 possessions than they did last season, when the league, as a whole, scored 109.7 per 100, the best mark in the 23 years for which we have play-by-play data. The Golden State Warriors, unsurprisingly, have taken the biggest dip (9.9 points per 100). Through Thursday (214 games), league-wide efficiency is at 107.5 points per 100 possessions. That\u2019s way down from the end-of-season mark for 2018-19, but not far from the league-wide mark \u2014 108.1 per 100 \u2014 at this point last season (215 games through Thursday of Week 5). Effective field goal percentage (51.8%) and free throw rate (26.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field) are down slightly from this point last season (51.9%, 26.8). The league has seen a bigger drop in offensive rebounding percentage, and yes, those extra travel calls have made an impact. Turnovers, with dead-ball turnovers being the bigger culprit, are up from 14.8 to 15.2 per 100 possessions. Still, five teams have managed to see jumps in offensive efficiency from their end-of-season marks. Here are the league\u2019s five most improved offenses as we head into the weekend \u2026 * * *  2018-19: 108.7 (20th) 2019-20: 114.7 (1st) Diff: +6.0 The Mavs lead the league in offensive efficiency , even though Kristaps Porzingis has shot just 40%. His effective field goal percentage of 46.9% ranks 134th among 161 players who have taken at least 100 shots. Luka Doncic, of course, is more than making up for Porzingis\u2019 inefficiency, averaging 29.9 points and 9.4 assists per game. He\u2019s shooting just 34% from 3-point range, but has seen a big improvement in how well he\u2019s shot in the paint and how often he\u2019s gone to the line. Doncic\u2019s 1.14 points per possession on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions are up from 0.90 last season and rank second among players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. His true shooting percentage of 62.5% is up from 54.5% last season and is the best mark among the top 20 players in usage rate. Along with Doncic, Delon Wright ( from 48% to 57% ) and Dorian Finney-Smith ( from 51% to 57% ) have both seen big jumps in effective field goal percentage. As a team, the Mavs rank 7th in effective field goal percentage (53.9%). That\u2019s the most important number on offense, but the Mavs\u2019 offense is about more than just shooting. While the league, as a whole, has seen a big jump in turnover percentage, six teams have seen a drop. And the Mavs have seen the biggest drop among them. Their 13.5 turnovers per 100 possessions rank fourth in the league and are down from 14.2 ( 21st ) last season. The Mavs also rank ninth in free throw rate and fourth in offensive rebounding percentage . If they somehow kept this up, they\u2019d be just the fourth team in the 24 seasons for which we have play-by-play data (and the first in the last 16) to rank in the top 10 in each of the offensive \u201cfour factors.\u201d (The others were 1996-97 Sonics , 2000-01 Lakers and 2003-04 Grizzlies .) The Mavs have played a relatively easy schedule in regard to opposing defenses. Eight of their 14 games have come against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10 in defensive efficiency , while only four have come against the top 10. So things will get tougher in that regard, and they have games against both the Clippers (9th) and Lakers (2nd) next week. Next 3 games : vs. CLE (19th on defense) on Friday ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ), @ HOU (15th) on Sunday ( 3:30 ET, League Pass ), vs. LAC (9th) on Tuesday ( 8:30 ET, NBA TV )  2018-19: 105.3 (28th) 2019-20: 110.4 (6th) Diff: +5.1 What stands out most about the Suns\u2019 offense is their league-leading assist percentage . They\u2019ve assisted on 68% of their buckets, up from 60% ( 17th ) last season. According to Second Spectrum tracking, they rank sixth in passes per 24 minutes of possession (355). Devin Booker has seen the percentage of his buckets that have been assisted rise from 36% last season to 53% this season . Of course, Booker has also shot a league-best 19-for-37 (51%) on pull-up 3-pointers. With Booker leading the way, and with the league\u2019s third-biggest jump in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area or 3-point range \u2014 from 67% (20th) to 75% (8th) \u2014 Phoenix has seen the league\u2019s second-biggest jump in effective field goal percentage. No team has seen a bigger increase in 3-point percentage than the Suns, who ranked 30th (32.9%) last season and are sixth (37.8%) this season. New Suns Aron Baynes, Cam Johnson and Dario Saric have shot a combined 41.4% on more than 12 3-point attempts per game. The Suns have also seen the league\u2019s second biggest drop in turnover percentage , going from 29th to 11th in that category. New point guard Ricky Rubio ranks eighth in the league with an assist-turnover ratio of 3.87. Among the teams on this list, the Suns have had the toughest schedule in regard to opposing defenses. Seven of their 14 games have come against teams that currently rank in the top 10 defensively, while only four of the 14 have come against the bottom 10. Their next 12 games \u2014 one (Sunday in Denver) against a top-10 defense and six against bottom-10 defenses \u2014 will be much easier in that regard. Next 3 games : @ MIN (16th) on Saturday ( 5 ET, League Pass ), @ DEN (7th) on Sunday ( 8 ET, League Pass ), vs. WAS (29th) on Wednesday ( 9 ET, League Pass )  2018-19: 110.2 (15th) 2019-20: 114.0 (2nd) Diff: +3.8 The Wizards are the big surprise on this list, though improved offense hasn\u2019t resulted in success in the standings, because their opponents have been more efficient than they have. Washington has seen the league\u2019s biggest drop in free throw rate, from 26.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field ( 11th ) last season to just 20.2 ( 29th ) this season. But they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s fifth-biggest jump in effective field goal percentage and a big jump in offensive rebounding percentage as well. The Wizards are the only team that rank in the top 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (56.9%, 8th), mid-range field goal percentage (46.0%, 3rd) and 3-point percentage (37.6%, 7th). The shooting in the paint is actually down from last season, but they\u2019ve shot much more effectively from outside the paint, even though their ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts has gone down. Ball and player movement has been a factor. The Wizards are one of two teams \u2014 the Pelicans are the other \u2014 that rank in the top five in both ball and player movement, according to Second Spectrum tracking. They rank 3rd at 372 passes per 24 minutes of possession and 4th at 11.7 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession. Those marks are up from 343 (16th) and 11.1 (20th) last season. It seems doubtful that Mo Wagner will continue to shoot better than 50% from 3-point range , but new Wizard Davis Bertans (at more than seven 3-point attempts per game) is right where he was last season (43%) and Bradley Beal could shoot better. This is actually the third straight season in which Beal has seen a drop in 3-point percentage . The Wizards have played the fewest games in the league , with only two of their 12 having come against teams that currently rank in the top 10 defensively and only three having come against teams that currently rank in the bottom 10. After they host the Hornets and Kings this weekend, their next eight games will be against teams that rank no worse that 14th defensively, with six of the eight against the top 10. Next 3 games : vs. CHA (23rd) on Friday ( 7 ET, League Pass ), vs. SAC (20th) on Sunday ( 6 ET, League Pass ), @ DEN (7th) on Tuesday ( 9 ET, League Pass )  2018-19: 107.4 (24th) 2019-20: 109.6 (10th) Diff: +2.2 Given the talent that they added over the summer, you could argue that the Lakers should be at the top of this list. And maybe they\u2019ll get there soon enough. But through 14 games, the Lakers\u2019 offense is behind their defense, which ranks second in the league . Anthony Davis\u2019 effective field goal percentage (50.4%) is the worst mark of his career , while LeBron James\u2019 mark of 53.9% is his worst in the last five seasons . So the Lakers\u2019 offense will probably get better, and it already has. After scoring just 105.5 points per 100 possessions over their first nine games, they\u2019ve scored 117.3 over their five-game winning streak . Still, this team could use another shooter or two. Danny Green \u2014 42% on 66 attempts \u2014 has been the only Laker who has shot better than the league average (35.3%) on more than four attempts from beyond the arc. The Lakers rank 21st in 3-point percentage (34.2%) and 26th in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (33.2%). Thus far, the Lakers\u2019 schedule has been fairly balanced in regard to opposing defenses: four games against the top 10, five against the middle 10, and five against the bottom 10. It will get easier \u2014 after starting a four-game trip in Oklahoma City on Friday, they\u2019ll play four straight games against teams that rank in the bottom six defensively \u2014 before it gets tougher. Next 3 games : @ OKC (12th) on Friday ( 8 ET, League Pass ), @ MEM (25th) on Saturday ( 8 ET, League Pass ), @ SAS (28th) on Monday ( 8:30 ET, League Pass )  2018-19: 106.7 (26th) 2019-20: 108.8 (12th) Diff: +2.1 The Heat rank last in turnover ratio by a pretty wide margin, with only two teams \u2014 Charlotte and Sacramento \u2014 having seen a bigger jump from last season. They\u2019ve also seen one of the league\u2019s biggest drops in offensive rebounding percentage. But Miami has seen both the league\u2019s biggest jump in effective field goal percentage and its biggest jump in free throw rate. The former is the most important. The Heat\u2019s improvement hasn\u2019t come with a big jump in getting the most efficient shots. Through Thursday, 71.4% of their shots have come from the restricted area or 3-point range. That\u2019s the league\u2019s 12th highest rate and up from 70.0% (13th) last season. But the Heat have shot better in the paint, from mid-range, and from beyond the arc. Only the Suns have seen a bigger jump in 3-point percentage, where the Heat have gone from 34.9% ( 21st ) last season to 39.6% ( second ) this season. Meyers Leonard is the official league-leader in 3-point percentage at 62%, though that has come on only 21 attempts. Duncan Robinson, the undrafted second-year wing who shot 10-for-35 from 3-point range last season, has made a greater impact, shooting 44% on 84 attempts . Goran Dragic has also seen an improvement (from 35% last season to 41% this season), and rookies Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn have combined to shoot 39% from beyond the arc. The improved free throw rate has come from the addition of Jimmy Butler, who ranks fourth in the league with 8.1 free throw attempts per game and has shot 85% at the line. Bam Adebayo has shot just 61%, but his free throw rate of 75 attempts per 100 shots from the field is up from 47 last season. That\u2019s the biggest jump among 222 players with at least 250 field goal attempts last season and at least 50 this season. The Heat have played just three of their 13 games against teams that currently rank in the top 10 in defensive efficiency. They\u2019ll have a fun test against the league\u2019s 10th ranked defense when Butler makes his return to Philadelphia on Saturday ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ). Next 3 games : @ CHI (13th) on Friday ( 8 ET, League Pass ), @ PHI (10th) on Saturday ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ), vs. CHA (23rd) on Monday ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Ringing endorsements from coach Rick Carlisle or those who\u2019ve faced him are also not required. There is no hype needed to shine a spotlight on Luka Doncic, the second-year Mavs star who is generating a buzz with each brilliant game he logs. W hen you join the elite list of players to average a 30-point triple-double in a 10-game span (Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Russell Westbrook and LeBron James) and you do it before turning 21, your superstar status is easy to verify. Doncic has played his way into any conversation about this season\u2019s best players and lands in the No. 3 spot in this Week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. His versatility and all-around dominance to date is drawing favorable comparisons with where James was at the same point in his career many years ago. Their head-to-head matchup on Nov. 1 \u2014 which the Lakers won in overtime \u2014 is already one of the season\u2019s most entertaining games . Their matching triple-doubles that night also seemed a fitting tribute to their similar styles as jumbo facilitators for their teams. Doncic went toe-to-toe with the player he most admired growing up and the mutual respect overflowed afterwards. \u201cYou never know who you can inspire along your path,\u201d James said then. \u201cFor me, playing the game the right way, getting my teammates involved and playing for the purity of the game, I was able to inspire a kid that wasn\u2019t even in America. That\u2019s pretty special.\u201d His current magical run has seen Doncic shred opponents while confirming all those comparisons to a young LeBron \u2014 albeit with a more polished offensive repertoire at the same stage. \u201cHe was already a great player last year, borderline All-Star. He\u2019s for sure an All-Star this year,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Doncic logged a 35-point triple-double against his team. \u201cHe just looks like he knows he\u2019s the best player on the floor out there.\u201d Doncic made history with his performance against Golden State , setting a record for consecutive 35-point triple-doubles (and sharing a record with Allen Iverson , too). \u201cHe \u2019 s having a phenomenal year,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201c I don \u2019 t know how else to characterize it. His ability to balance the paint game with the outside game makes him really tough to deal with for opponents, and he \u2019 s on a really great roll right now.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the 2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 30.5 points, 13.8 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.5 blocks, 1.5 steals Anything you do, Giannis can do better. He jumped in on this season\u2019s triple-double parade with 24 points, 19 rebounds and (a career-high) 15 assists in Thursday\u2019s win over Portland. It was his second triple-double of the season and 16th of his career . Wilt Chamberlain (three times), Oscar Robertson (three) and Larry Bird are the only other ones to have done what Antetokounmpo did on Thursday. Last week: No. 2 Season stats:  25.0 points, 11.1 assists, 7.9 rebounds, 1.3 steals Lakers legend Magic Johnson is convinced LeBron is on track for his fifth Kia MVP. With the Lakers riding their five-game (and counting) win streak to the top of the NBA standings, it\u2019s easy to see why so many are aboard the James train. Anthony Davis is also operating at an MVP-level, giving the Lakers the look of a team bound for a championship chase. Last week: No. 9 Season stats:  29.9 points, 10.6 rebounds, 9.4 assists, 1.4 steals Just 14 games into his sophomore season and Doncic has skipped the line with one outlandish performance after another. Already this week Doncic posted the first 40-point triple-double of his career in a win over the Spurs. Two days later, he got the first 35-point triple-double in under 30 minutes in NBA history. Last week: No. 4 Season stats:  38.4 points, 7.5 assists, 5.8 rebounds, 1.7 steals Russell Westbrook would appreciate it if you don\u2019t try to normalize Harden\u2019s greatness. It\u2019s impossible to do that when Harden rips off a stretch of eight straight games (all wins) scoring 35 or more points \u2026 or when a 27-point, seven-rebound, seven-assist night (like he had Thursday in a loss to Denver ) qualifies as an \u201coff night.\u201d Last week: No. 4 Season stats:  25.8 points, 8.6 rebounds, 5.7 assists. 2.2 steals, 1.1 blocks Leonard\u2019s load management situation is what it is. His impact on winning for the Clippers is not complicated. And now that he has Paul George healthy and in a groove, the 1-2 punch they bring on both ends of the floor is something to see (just ask Boston). The Rockets will get a chance to see what they can do against them tonight ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

The Kawhi & Paul Show, Episode 2: Another night, another test against a title-hopeful for the LA Clippers and their duo of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. When we last saw them, PG and Kawhi were deferring to each other (a bit too much) in a thrilling, 107-104 overtime win Wednesday against the Celtics. The last time Houston and L.A. met, however, James Harden lit up the Clippers for 47 points and Austin Rivers was busy trolling his dad at game\u2019s end. Neither team has any mysterious injuries to concern themselves with tonight ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ), making this a fully stocked superstar showdown with storylines galore. 2. A tasty East-West clash: Denver and Boston are squaring off ( 9 ET, League Pass ) in a matchup of the No. 2 seeds in the West and East, respectively. The Nuggets already have home wins against the Heat and Sixers this season and a victory against the Celtics would come two days after a solid showing against the Rockets . Don\u2019t expect a ton of passing miscues, though \u2014 Denver (1.95) and Boston (1.93) rank first and second, respectively, this season in assist-to-turnover ratio. 3. (Dubious) history beckons for Spurs: To say San Antonio is reeling is quite the understatement: it\u2019s current seven-game skid is the franchise\u2019s longest since 1997. The last time San Antonio lost eight in a row was also in 1996-97 (Nov. 15-30, 1996). Having a road date with the Sixers is hardly what the doctor ordered ( 8 ET, ESPN ), too. That all said, this one could be interesting late as the Spurs have a Top 10 offense (that dips in the fourth quarter ) and the Sixers have a Top 10 defense (that gets better in the fourth quarter ). 4. Lakers try to keep rolling: The concerns about Kyle Kuzma\u2019s eye injury are a thing of the past as the Lakers head to Oklahoma City ( 8 ET, League Pass ) in search of a sixth straight win. Already this season, Los Angeles has amassed two win streaks of five or more games. For a little context, the last time that happened was in the 2012-13 season (when the Kobe Bryant-Pau Gasol-Steve Nash-Dwight Howard squad went 45-37 and lost in the first round). 5. Someone\u2019s gotta win, right?: Blake Griffin says there\u2019s a \u201csense of urgency\u201d around the Pistons during their five-game skid. The Hawks are looking to improve their defense as they look to reverse a four-game slump. However you slice it, Atlanta and Detroit have been a bit of a letdown and face each other tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ) in hopes of staying in the still-developing Eastern Conference chase.

The first gray uniform in franchise history, the City Edition will make its on-court debut on Friday, December 6, when the Hornets host the Brooklyn Nets. Along with being cool gray, which became an accent color when the Hornets name returned to Charlotte in 2014, the City Edition features an entirely new design from previous seasons. Like the 2019-20 Statement Edition, the chest plate says \u201cCHA,\u201d matching the NBA\u2019s official abbreviation for the Hornets. This marks the first season the team has used the abbreviation, which appears in purple with a white outline, on its jerseys. The numbers on both sides of the jersey are white with a purple outline, while the player\u2019s name on the back is all purple. The trim around the neck and arms is purple, teal and black. A cell pattern appears on the sides of both the jersey and shorts, which is a new look for the team\u2019s uniform designs. On the shorts, the cell pattern is joined by the team\u2019s partial primary logo on each side. The Buzz City logo appears on the waistband. The Hornets are scheduled to wear the City Edition uniform for five home games and 10 road contests. The games in which the team wears the uniform at home will be designated as the City Series, celebrating Charlotte\u2019s culture, diversity and style. Along with the December 6 contest, the Hornets will wear the City Edition uniform on February 8 against the Dallas Mavericks, March 1 against the Milwaukee Bucks, March 19 against the Philadelphia 76ers and April 11 against the Washington Wizards. In conjunction with the City Series games, the Hornets will collaborate with local brands and designers on limited edition T-shirts that fans will have the opportunity to win via Hornets digital channels and purchase in the Hornets Fan Shop. Like the rest of the team\u2019s uniforms, the City Edition features the logos of Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand on the right chest and partner LendingTree on the left chest. The Official Loan Shopping Partner of the Charlotte Hornets, LendingTree has its logo on each of the team\u2019s jerseys for the third consecutive season. As part of a robust sponsorship package, the company is also the entitlement partner for the Hornets App and the Hornets Hoops youth basketball program. The City Edition jersey will be available for sale at the Hornets Fan Shop at Spectrum Center this morning when the store opens at 11 a.m. An expanded apparel line around the City Edition uniform including T-shirts, shorts, hats and more will also be available.

Featuring \u201cBED-STUY\u201d emblazoned across the chest, the Nets\u2019 2019-20 Nike City Edition uniform represents the neighborhood\u2019s storied history, its lasting impact in music, art, & culture, and the icon who put it on the map. https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrooklynNets\/status\/1197676066703368192 The white uniform features a multi-color \u201cBrooklyn Camo\u201d pattern, which runs down the sides of the jersey & shorts, and along the neck and arm trim. The pattern represents the cultural diversity in the borough, which is home to people of all races, religions, and ethnicities, who have one important unifying trait \u2013 Brooklyn swagger. The BED-STUY mark was designed by renowned graphic artist Eric Haze, whose work can also be seen on the team\u2019s 2019-20 Statement Edition uniform, as well as on the Nets\u2019 City Edition uniforms from last season. As with all Nets uniforms, the jersey will feature the Infor patch on the top left chest.  The uniforms were unveiled at an exclusive party at The Brooklyn Bank in Bed-Stuy with Nets center DeAndre Jordan and a special performance by rapper and Bed-Stuy native, Joey Bada$$. At the party the Nets also unveiled a tribute mural of Biggie, commissioned by local artist David Hollier. The 5-by-7 foot piece features an image of Biggie created by a composite of the lyrics to Sky\u2019s the Limit. In addition, to honor the lasting legacy of Biggie, the Nets and Nike will revive a music program at Bed-Stuy\u2019s Madiba Prep Middle School of Social Justice and Innovation. The school piloted a band program in 2018, but due to lack of funding the program was not able to continue. The investment from the Nets and Nike will reintroduce the music program, which will include 20 weeks of clarinet, trumpet, guitar and percussion classes for 40 sixth grade students. A pep rally to tip-off the partnership will be held on December 5. The Brooklyn Conservatory of Music helped to identify the school and will provide a team of instructors for the classes. The jerseys will be available for purchase at the Swag Shop at Barclays Center beginning Friday, November 22 at noon, and online at netsstore.com on Wednesday, November 27 at 6:00 a.m. The Nets will wear the uniform on court for the first time on Friday, November 29 vs. the Boston Celtics at noon.

All-Star center Nikola Vucevic was diagnosed with a right lateral ankle sprain and will be re-evaluated in 7-10 days. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that the injury should sideline Vucevic for a month. The Magic are currently 6-8, but are 0-5 on the road after falling to the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night .  Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon both suffered right ankle injuries in the second quarter of Wednesday\u2019s game. Vucevic used two crutches to leave the locker room afterward, while Gordon had one. Vucevic is averaging 17.1 points, 11.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game this season after posting 20.8 ppg, 12.0 rpg and 3.8 apg last season en route to his first All-Star appearance. He came in as the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging 21.7 points, 14.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.33 blocks during Orlando\u2019s winning streak. He went down along his own baseline with 5:29 left in the second after injuring his ankle while trying to defend Norman Powell\u2019s drive to the basket. \u201dIt was really painful,\u201d Vucevic said. \u201dIt was hard for me to put any pressure on [it].\u201d Vucevic had to be helped to the locker room, unable to put weight on his right leg.

On Thursday, the Pacers paid tribute to the city\u2019s legacy of auto racing as well as the team\u2019s modern identity, unveiling their new Nike City Edition uniform for the 2019-20 season. The new uniforms are a refreshed take on the City Edition uniforms the team wore during the 2017-18 season . While the uniforms two years ago were primarily blue, this year\u2019s uniforms are primarily white, with a number of additional tweaks to the design. The jersey number remains encircled on the front of the jersey in the style of a classic IndyCar nosecone. But while the jersey number two years ago was gold with no trim, this year\u2019s jersey features a blue number with gold trim. The most noticeably different element on this year\u2019s uniform is found on the vertical checkered racing stripe that lines the left side of both the jersey and shorts. Nike says that \u201cthe checkered stripe symbolizes not only the city\u2019s deep ties to auto racing but the Pacers\u2019 tireless pursuit of victory.\u201d Two years ago, the checkered pattern contained two different shades of gold. On this year\u2019s uniform, the checkered pattern instead consists of two shades of blue: a darker traditional shade similar to the primary color the team has worn for the better part of two decades, as well as lighter shade closer to royal blue, reminiscent of the color seen in Indiana\u2019s uniforms in the 1980s . \u201cPACERS\u201d is spelled out vertically down the checkered stripe on the jersey in white lettering with gold trim. The phrase \u201cALWAYS LEAD\u201d appears in gold lettering on the checkered stripe just above the jersey tag, another homage to the city\u2019s racing tradition.

That brother, twin Robin, was within easy ear shot in the bleachers immediately behind Brook\u2019s chair. But he never looked up from the tiny screen in his oversized hand, his laughter not at all in sync with his brother\u2019s comments. They were in different worlds a few feet apart, maybe different planets, which is how they claim to like it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something,\u201d said Brook, the Bucks\u2019 starting center, of the two pair of brothers on Milwaukee\u2019s roster. \u201cNot nothing.\u201d He liked that. \u201cIt\u2019s not nothing,\u201d Brook repeated, brightening. \u201cThere\u2019s your headline.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s not going to work, because this definitely is something. It\u2019s rare enough for an NBA team to employ a pair of brothers, but it\u2019s nearly unprecedented for anyone to employ two pair. In fact, it only happened once before. For about half of the 2014-15 season, the Phoenix Suns had both Marcus and Markieff Morris and Goran and Zoran Dragic on their squad. The first three were regulars, while Zoran appeared in only six games before he and his brother were traded to Miami in a multi-team deal. Thanasis Antetokounmpo, at 27 the older brother by two years to 2019 Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, has appeared in only two games so far. But he had a moment over the weekend, when his fast-break, alley-oop layup at Indiana checked the last box in this oddity: Three sets of brothers \u2014 the four Bucks players and the Pacers\u2019 Aaron and Justin Holiday \u2014 participated and scored in an NBA game. Or course, it\u2019s all the other times they\u2019re around each other, on or off the court, in practice or on the road, that makes this arrangement as valuable as it is unusual for the Lopez and Antetokounmpo bros. And even for those who aren\u2019t blood relatives. \u201cIt\u2019s special in a lot of ways,\u201d veteran shooter Kyle Korver said. \u201cOne, it\u2019s rare to make it to the NBA. So it\u2019s even more rare for two to make it to the NBA. Then there are 30 teams, so for both to end up on the same team \u2014 and there\u2019s two [pair] of them \u2014 that\u2019s unique.\u201d How do the family connections exhibit themselves? \u201cYou can tell that both sets of brothers are very close,\u201d Korver said. \u201cEveryone is a competitor, but you can tell that each brother has the other\u2019s back. It\u2019s fun, coming from a family of brothers [Korver grew up as one of four boys], to watch them play out here. It makes your heart feel good, like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. Pulling for each other.\u2019 \u201c Milwaukee signed Robin and Thanasis this offseason first and foremost as players. Coach Mike Budenholzer admitted that he had his antenna up lest there be any whiff of cliques or buddy-ball owing to the family bonds (\u201cOff on an island by themselves,\u201d he termed it). So did Giannis, as big an advocate for his four brothers \u2014 Francis, Thanasis, Kostas and Alex \u2014 as one could be. \u201cAt first, in the summer, before we came together, we were like, \u2018Oh man, two sets of brothers. How is that going to be?\u2019\u201d Giannis said. \u201c\u2018Is that going to work?\u2019 But now, we\u2019ve got chemistry. Your best friend, obviously, is going to be your brother. \u201cSince the season started, when we get in here, he\u2019s not my brother. It\u2019s Thanasis, Robin, Brook, Khris, Bledsoe, we\u2019re having to go out there and do our jobs. But sometimes it\u2019s fun.\u201d Every team, every coach, wants to shape the camaraderie and trust in their locker room into a band of brothers. The Bucks have given themselves a head start. THE FIRST RULE of a mock sibling rivalry is: You do not talk about a mock sibling rivalry. Therefore, it\u2019s easy to imagine that the Lopez boys don\u2019t much care for each other. When they pass each other on the floor, one subbing in, the other exiting, there\u2019s generally no glimmer of recognition. No fist bump, hand slap or eye contact whatsoever. It\u2019s been a part of their schtick since they entered the league five picks apart in the 2008 Draft \u2014 Brook went No. 10 overall to the Nets; Robin, No. 15 to Phoenix \u2014 and nothing has changed now that, in their 12th season, they\u2019re finally teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re on opposite sides of the locker room,\u201d Robin said last week, typically deadpan. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s helping the cohesiveness of everything.\u201d So what impact has the physical proximity had on their allegedly cantankerous relationship? \u201cI think it heightens it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a few buffers here, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d Unlike the Antetokounmpos, who spend a lot of time together and in conversation, Brook and Robin seem at times to co-exist in parallel universes. They\u2019re identical but easy to tell apart, with Robin more wild-haired and wild-eyed, Brook more clean cut. They get under each other\u2019s skin \u2014 in this pebble-grained performance art, anyway \u2014 to keep it entertaining but never nasty. \u201cI always get a kick out of it when we scrimmage, and they\u2019re doing the jump ball against each other,\u201d Korver said. \u201cI always laugh to myself a little bit. \u201cYou can tell that neither one likes the other to score on him in practice. They\u2019re going to complain about [the other\u2019s] travel or foul or something. But I think mostly, it\u2019s really healthy.\u201d Said Giannis: \u201cIt\u2019s different. When they play [in practice], they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re brothers. They just go at each other hard all the time. That\u2019s a good thing. Like when Thanasis and I play, we don\u2019t look like we\u2019re brothers. He comes at me hard, and I\u2019ll go at him hard. Try to block his shot, try to hit him. But once we leave the court, we go back to family.\u201d Brook, peeling back the curtain a little, admitted that teaming with his twin for the first time since Stanford, has been a positive. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously great to have another player who really fits into the way the Bucks are mentally, how we approach the game,\u201d he said. \u201cA tough player who is trying to play the right way. Defense first \u2014 we\u2019re based on our defense. And who\u2019s unselfish and wants what best for the team.\u201d And off the court? \u201cHe\u2019s a fun guy to hang out with \u2014 a couple times of month.\u201d As for the worst thing about having his brother on board this season, Brook smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time for that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game is at 7 o\u2019clock tonight, right? I could just make a huge list between now and then. I could keep going.\u201d They\u2019ve been free spirits much of their lives, raised in California with older brothers Alex and Chris by a single mother. Deborah Ledford, a school teacher by trade, and her family made sure her sons were exposed to the arts, particularly reading, with sports slotting in alongside. There was no denying their potential, though, as they grew to 7 feet and developed their games at San Joaquin Memorial High in Fresno, then for two seasons in Palo Alto. Brook has been the more prolific offensive player and an All-Star in 2013, while Robin has been content to focus on defense and rim protection. Not that he\u2019s a fanatic about it. After shooting only 20 3-point attempts in his first 10 seasons, Robin put up 31 a year ago as reports of Brook\u2019s long-distance prowess filtered down to Chicago. And already this season, he has jacked up 23 from outside the arc, making (cough) five. After games, they typically exit the locker room separately, though often dressed similarly in Star Wars or sports apparel and baseball caps. They\u2019ll text each other after games now the same as they did when they played on opposite sides of the country \u2014 in group chats with other friends. Even though they\u2019re sitting maybe 25 feet apart. \u201cThey\u2019re different,\u201d Thanasis said. \u201cYes, they are twins, but they\u2019re unique in their own ways. They\u2019re both energetic, but I would say Robin\u2019s a little bit more. In general. Brook is really chill. But both of them, they like a lot of stuff I like, like Disney and comic books, different characters. They\u2019re both amazing guys, man.\u201d  THE ANTETOKOUNMPOS, BY CONTRAST , like to huddle. On buses, on planes, over lunch and like clockwork after games. Thanasis generally will roll his chair halfway across the room to sit next to his brother. Thanasis often is fully dressed by then, while Giannis still is wearing parts of his uniform, poking at his phone while icing his knees as well as a foot or ankle. At 11-3, there haven\u2019t been many nights of frustration for Giannis. But for someone as committed to continuous improvement as he\u2019s said and shown, the 25-year-old three-time All-NBA performer always can find some nit to pick in his performance. Thanasis\u2019 desire to help him goes way back. \u201cI\u2019m always protective, because I\u2019m the older brother,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are like \u2018Why? He\u2019s 6-10. He\u2019s a big boy.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, no. That\u2019s my little brother.\u2019\u201d Thanasis played in two games for the Knicks in 2015-16, then went back to play in Europe over the past three seasons. He is a 6-foot-6 wing, most valued for his defense. And let\u2019s be honest, the Bucks liked the idea of keeping their superstar focused and his family united. Their mother Veronica is in Milwaukee, as is youngest brother Alex, a 6-foot-7 high school senior at Dominican High. Kostas is in his second NBA season with the Lakers, after spending his rookie season in Dallas\u2019 system. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing, just being able to talk to my brother,\u201d Thanasis said. \u201cWatching the way he works and he\u2019s so positive about his work ethic. Not talking on the phone but seeing him every day. And for me, just being full-time with my family.\u201d The support runs in all directions. Last week, when Thanasis was farmed out to play a G League game with the Wisconsin Herd in Oshkosh, it didn\u2019t matter that early winter had descended on the region. Giannis & Co. made the 160-mile roundtrip drive through icy, snowy conditions. Their guy scored 14 points in 26 minutes, but that didn\u2019t matter either. \u201cWhat do I think? I would have done the same thing,\u201d Thanasis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even for discussion. If he had been playing in Alaska, I\u2019d have gone to Alaska to watch him play. Or Kostas or Alexis. If I could go, I\u2019d go.\u201d This, after all, was the brother who accompanied a scared 18-year-old from Athens to New York in June 2013 for the NBA Draft. The guy who looked out for him, kept him company and waved that Greek flag at Barclays Center when his name was read (with a smile and careful enunciation by commissioner David Stern) as the No. 15 pick. \u201cThanasis has supported me from Day One,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cWhen my brother is playing, I have to go support him. It was a long drive, I had to drive slow. When I came back, my back was hurting. But it was worth it to see Thansais and Dragan [Bender] play, and [two-way Bucks] Cam [Reynolds] and Frank [Mason III] and all those guys play.\u201d Giannis wouldn\u2019t seem to need much advice, but he credits his across-the-board improvements (slight or sizable) to the sibling whispering in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m definitely helping him, but I think he helps me more,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cHe talks to me, tells me to be aggressive. He knows my game, what I can do and what I cannot do. He just gives me confidence. More defensively, but offensively, he\u2019s always like, \u2018Don\u2019t stop! Keep going! Make sure you pull up. Keep working on your game.\u2019 Hearing that from an older brother, it\u2019s always good. But I\u2019ve got to do the same.\u201d Said Korver: \u201cThat family is super tight. A lot of us come from close-knit families and the Antetokounmpos are one of them. When you ask him about different brothers, he lights up. He\u2019s so excited for them and their basketball opportunities. It\u2019s family first for them.\u201d Given their length, their talent and their dreams, the question hung in the air the other night after Milwaukee beat the Bulls at United Center: Does a team get bonus points in trying to sign him as a possible 2021 free agent based on how many of the brothers it employs? Thanasis said the family just hopes to have as many of them playing professionally as they can. Still, Giannis\u2019 take counts most on this one. \u201cAll I can say to that is, I\u2019ve played with my brothers before,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cOne of our goals is to play on the national team at the same time. Like we did this summer, but Kostas didn\u2019t make the final roster cut. \u201cDefinitely I would love to play with my brothers. But in the NBA, I have to do my job and lock in.\u201d The Bucks are showing this season that it\u2019s possible to do both. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In addition to its November 27th debut, fans can look forward to seeing the team wear the City Edition uniform for these upcoming games: * Tuesday, December 3 vs. Detroit Pistons 7:00 p.m. * Friday, December 6 vs. Orlando Magic 7:30 p.m. * Saturday, January 4 vs. Oklahoma City Thunder 7:30 p.m. * Sunday, January 5 vs. Minnesota Timberwolves 7:30 p.m. * Tuesday, January 7 vs. Detroit Pistons 7:00 p.m. * Monday, March 2 vs. Utah Jazz 7:00 p.m. * Wednesday, March 4 vs. Boston Celtics 7:00 p.m. * Saturday, March 7 vs. Denver Nuggets 7:30 p.m. * Thursday, March 26 vs. Los Angeles Lakers 7:00 p.m. * Monday, March 30 vs. Phoenix Suns 7:00 p.m. Designed in collaboration with Nike, the 2019-20 City Edition uniform is the final installment of five uniforms that will be worn during the 2019-20 season. The one-season alternative uniform joins the Icon (wine), Association (white), Statement (black) and the recently introduced Classic (black, orange and powder blue) uniforms. The City Edition\u2019s navy colorway is inspired by the Cavs alternate uniforms that were worn by the team from 2005 to 2010. The front of the jersey acknowledges the uniform worn by the inaugural Cavaliers team (1970-74) with the letters CLE in a bold, gold script accented with a feather. Framing the nostalgic script is the Nike Swoosh logo on the upper right chest and the iconic Goodyear Wingfoot logo on the upper left. A gold accent trim that outlines the V of the neckline represents the base of the current Cavaliers shield logo. The player number appears in a wine and gold inline typeface that is inspired by the black, orange and powder blue uniforms that debuted when the Cavs returned to the city in 1994 to play at the brand-new Gund Arena in downtown Cleveland after two decades of playing more than 20 miles away at the Coliseum in Richfield. Wine, gold and white hashmarks line the side paneling of the uniform and resemble the design of the Cavaliers uniform from 1974 through 1980, most notably worn during the \u201cMiracle of Richfield\u201d in 1976. The back of the jersey features the player name and number in gold with the NBA logo centered above the lettering of the player\u2019s last name. A small square patch on the back-center collar displays the number \u201c1\u201d positioned inside of the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy to represent the Cavaliers NBA Championship in 2016. This is a standard feature on the uniforms of all teams that have won an NBA Championship. The waistband of the navy shorts displays an element of the Cavs \u201cV-basket\u201d logo from 1983 to 1994. The side of the shorts also features a continuation of the wine, gold and white color block paneling that appears on the jersey. Cavaliers Introduce City Edition \u201cCLE\u201d Home Court  A special City Edition court has been designed to accompany the team\u2019s uniform during 11 games throughout the 50th season. To complement the design of the uniform, the bold, gold \u201cCLE\u201d feather logo outlined in navy, inspired by the Cavaliers original logo from 1970-74, is displayed at half court. A solid navy perimeter frames the natural hard wood floor. The lane is solid navy and is accented with wine and gold. On each baseline, Cleveland Cavaliers is bookended by wine, gold and white hashmarks that resemble the ones on the sides of the uniform. The Cavaliers 50th season logo and the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse logo can be read on each half court.

Jeff and Stan have done their work on the sidelines, first as coaches, now as broadcasters. With Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Brook and Robin Lopez, the Milwaukee Bucks currently lead the league in active brothers. Here, arguably, are the 10 \u201cbest\u201d brother acts in NBA history. * * * 10. Marcus and Markieff Morris. These guys get bonus points for being twins, a more frequent trait of NBA brothers than one might expect. They also have kept the focus on their shared DNA for much of their career, not just enjoying their time together with Phoenix to start their careers (2012-15) but actually sharing a four-year, $52 million contract that they divvied up themselves. 9. Horace and Harvey Grant. Another set of NBA twins, taking different paths in their impact. Horace was a member of four championships teams (three with Chicago, one with the Lakers), reached the 1995 Finals with Orlando and earned one All-Star nod. Harvey was a workmanlike, less-decorated power forward for 11 seasons but delivered sons Jerami and Jerian to the NBA as well. The Grants nosed out Jim and John Paxson , notable for also getting three rings with Michael Jordan (John). Jim was a two-time All-Star , twice averaging more than 20 points per game for Portland. Their familial connection extends to father Jim, who played 138 games with Minneapolis and Cincinnati in the 1950s .  8. Brent, Jon and Drew Barry. If two is a brother act, three is a family affair \u2014 something the Barry boys owed at least in part to their father Rick, the Hall of Famer best known for his prolific scoring and leadership with the Warriors. Brent won two titles with San Antonio, played 14 seasons and won the 1996 Slam Dunk contest . Jon was a dangerous 3-point threat (39.2%) for eight teams across his 14 seasons . Drew stuck around to play 60 games in three seasons but, with a 38.1% 3-point prowess, might have lasted longer in today\u2019s game.  7. Caldwell, Charles, Major and Wil Jones . If three is great, is four better? The Jones family ups the ante on the Barrys or, for that matter, the current threesome of Jrue, Justin and Aaron Holiday . Caldwell was the best known of the bunch , playing in 1,299 games, making one All-Star team and two All-Defensive teams. Charles got a ring as a member of the 1995 Rockets. Major was the minor Jones contributor, logging 374 games in six seasons . And Wil spent seven of his nine seasons in the ABA before reaching the NBA with Indiana and Buffalo . 6. Stephen and Seth Curry. Only one Kia Most Valuable Player \u2014 until Antetokounmpo \u2014 had a brother who played in the league, and that\u2019s Stephen. The Golden State deep threat has credentials that are unassailable, but Seth hasn\u2019t done enough yet at this level to boost the tandem higher on this list. And sorry, brothers-in-law (Warriors guard Damion Lee and Rockets guard Austin Rivers) don\u2019t count here. 5. Bernard and Albert King . Bernard is a Hall of Famer known for his unstoppable mid-range scoring and possibly the greatest comeback from knee surgery in NBA history. Albert is best known, well, for not being Bernard, despite a tremendous college career. Still, he averaged 12.1 points for four teams in a career that included stints in Israel and the CBA. 4. Al and Dick McGuire . Al was a brash journeyman guard from New York who averaged 6.1 fouls per 36 minutes played. Dick was a smooth seven-time All-Star with the Knicks and Pistons. Together, they are the only pair of brothers to reach the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame (Al got in thanks to his NCAA coaching at Marquette).  3. Dominique and Gerald Wilkins . With all due respect to George and Ed Mikan from the league\u2019s pioneer era, Dominque is probably the greatest former player to have had a brother reach the league. The Hall of Famer ranks 14th all-time in scoring, one spot ahead of George Gervin. And Gerald was better than cup-of-coffee Derrick Gervin, scoring nearly 12,000 points in his 900 games while fathering former NBA journeyman Damien Wilkins . In time, the Currys might bump these guys down.  2. Tom and Dick Van Arsdale . Perhaps the league\u2019s most famous twins through its first three decades or so, the Van Arsdales had appropriately symmetrical careers. The 6-foot-5 wings both starred at Indiana. They were drafted consecutively in 1965 ( Dick was picked No. 10 ). Both made the NBA\u2019s all-rookie team. Each was a three-time All-Star. Dick averaged at least 20 points three times, Tom did it twice, though Tom finished with more total points (15,079 to 14,232). They wrapped up together in Phoenix in 1976-77 , combining for 13.5 points in 38.2 minutes.  1. Pau and Marc Gasol . Early on, it seemed like this brother act would be best known for being traded for each other . That happened on Feb. 1, 2008, back when a 27-year-old Pau was hitting his prime while Marc was still playing in Europe. Not a chance now. Both are Hall of Fame bound, with three rings, nine All-Star appearances, six all-NBA berths, two all-Rookie selections and individual hardware (2002 Rookie of the Year for Pau, 2013 Defensive Player of the Year for Marc). This doesn\u2019t even account for their play in international competition. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Big challenge for Anthony: After getting off to a quick start in his first game with Portland, Carmelo Anthony came down to Earth in a 115-104 loss to New Orleans on Tuesday. It might not get any easier for Anthony as he and the Blazers visit the Bucks tonight ( 8 ET, TNT ) \u2026 which means a likely matchup with reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. The last Anthony vs. Antetokounmpo matchup came on Dec. 29, 2017 when \u2018Melo was with the Thunder. In that game, Antetokounmpo had 23 points and 12 rebounds to Anthony\u2019s 12 points and six rebounds (and Milwaukee won, 97-95 ). 2. Suns try to slow struggles: Losing four of six games after a feel-good 5-2 start will do a lot to temper feelings about a team. That\u2019s the spot Phoenix may find itself in now as New Orleans comes to town ( 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT ) fresh off spoiling the Anthony debut game. The Pelicans\u2019 Lonzo Ball and Jahlil Okafor are both questionable for this game. 3. For the love of Luka!: With just two games on the schedule tonight, there\u2019s a lot of time to catch up on things around the NBA or, maybe, bask in a great storyline or two. If you\u2019re up for the latter, may we suggest the dazzling performance Luka Doncic put on last night against Golden State. He set an NBA record in becoming the first player to record a 35-point triple-double in 25 minutes or less played."},{"id":30495,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-20-kia-rookie-ladder-nov-21","date":"2019-11-21","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Kendrick Nunn (and others) rising the ranks","content":" At this point, it\u2019s starting to sound like a broken record \u2014 every week, another rookie makes a name for himself. Last week, we highlighted Bulls guard Coby White for his breakout performances. This week, several rookies had big games that seemed to catch everyone by surprise. How\u2019s this for coming out of nowhere? Entering Monday, Chicago\u2019s Daniel Gafford had played just 13 minutes all season. His stats : 0 points, 1 rebound, not even a shot attempt. But that all changed against the Bucks on Monday . Gafford played 20 minutes, scoring 21 points on 10-for-12 shooting, grabbing five rebounds, blocking a pair of shots and throwing down dunk after dunk. Gafford, whom the Bulls grabbed with the 38th pick out of Arkansas , looked polished running the pick-and-roll with Zach LaVine on several occasions and showed he\u2019s got the size and athleticism to help him earn more playing time. \u201cHe knows how to keep his game in a box and do the things that he\u2019s good at, which is defending, rolling, rebounding, vertical spacing, competing, effort plays, physicality,\u201d coach Jim Boylen said afterward . But Gafford wasn\u2019t the only one stepping up this week. In New Orleans, Jaxson Hayes had a big night on a big NBA TV game, willing the Pelicans to a win over the struggling Warriors. Hayes was all over the court, scoring 10 points, grabbing 10 rebounds and blocking three shots while changing the game with his energy and length in the lane. And in Toronto, another undrafted rookie is starting to emerge as a reliable option off the bench. Terence Davis, a 6-foot-4 guard who played four seasons at Ole Miss, has scored in double-digits in three of his past four games , highlighted by a 19-point, eight-rebound, five-assist night in a win over the Magic on Wednesday. When asked if this is what the Raptors expected from the rookie, coach Nick Nurse said it best. \u201cI think we might be seeing more than we expected to see,\u201d Nurse said . Nurse might not have expected this, but anyone following the Kia Rookie Ladder knows this is just how it goes with an opportunistic and hungry rookie class. * * * Last week: No. 1 Memphis saw its past and future on Friday, and the future looks bright. With Mike Conley back in town, Morant scored 25 points with eight assists and dazzled with several big plays \u2014 including a go-ahead bucket late \u2014 to lead the Grizzlies to a 107-106 win. While Conley was a steady influence for years, Morant may be the one to take them to another level. \u201cHe\u2019s incredible,\u201d teammate Jaren Jackson Jr. said of Morant. \u201cHis change of speeds, change of direction is just different. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t find too often. It\u2019s kind of a once-in-a-lifetime talent.\u201d 2. Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat  Last week: No. 5 The Heat are rolling, and Nunn is a big reason why. Miami has climbed to third in the East , thanks to a four-game win streak in which Nunn has averaged 19 points and 5.3 assists on 53.4% shooting (43.5% on 3s). He\u2019s playing big-time minutes (34.6) and doing it on both ends of the floor, leading all rookies in steals (1.5 spg). Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry saw Nunn drop 22 on his team Saturday, and left impressed .  \u201cI think what this kid has done has been phenomenal. It just doesn\u2019t happen in this league where you\u2019re not in the league and all of a sudden you\u2019re a leading scorer on a team with a really good record and you seem to [be] a guy they go to early on.  .. . He\u2019s playing with so much confidence, it\u2019s unbelievable. And he feels like not only does he belong, but feels like he\u2019s the best player on the floor more than half the time. He hadn\u2019t been that wrong really.\u201d 3. Eric Paschall, Golden State Warriors  Last week: Not ranked The Warriors are reeling like they\u2019ve never reeled before, but Paschall remains a bright spot. In his past four games, the versatile big man has delivered 21.3 ppg and 6.8 rpg , highlighted by a 30-point, seven-rebound showing on Sunday in a loss in New Orleans. With the team banged up like it is, Paschall will continue to see big minutes, so it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll see a drastic dip in production. Last week: No. 2 Barrett slips a bit this week, but he hasn\u2019t been awful. He put up 22 points on 8-for-16 shooting in a loss to the Hornets last week, then helped New York beat the Cavs with an all-around good game . He only scored 15 points on 5-for-13 shooting but he had a pair of steals and a pair of blocks in 24 minutes of the 123-105 home win. Barrett\u2019s week ended on a down note, though, as he and the Knicks went cold down the stretch as they blew a big lead to the 76ers, falling 109-104 on Wednesday after leading by as much as 17 in the third quarter. Barrett missed all three of his shots in the fourth quarter, but wasn\u2019t discouraged afterward. \u201cI got my shots,\u2019\u2019 he said . \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make them all. But I got them and I was happy with that.\u2019\u2019 Last week: Not ranked The No. 13 pick jumps back into the top 5 after a week in which he averaged 16.7 ppg as the Heat are rolling. The fact Miami is winning with a pair of rookies seeing big minutes (even Chris Silva is starting to see some playing time) makes their rise to third in the East even more noteworthy. Herro has once again found his shooting touch, hitting at a 59.4% clip in three games this week, including 6-for-12 on 3-pointers. Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies: Clarke has scored in double-digits in seven straight games and had another solid week, averaging 15.3 points and 4.7 rebounds while shooting 65.5% from the field. Coby White, Chicago Bulls: White had a decent week, averaging 14.5 points over four games, highlighted by a 26-point outburst last Thursday in a loss to Milwaukee in which he was 6-for-13 from beyond the arc. Over his last five games, he\u2019s 50% on 3s (20-for-40) and continues to provide a spark off the bench. DeAndre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks: Hunter has scored in double-digits in six straight games , and had his best showing yet Wednesday night. The No. 4 pick scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds while hitting all three 3-pointers in Atlanta\u2019s 135-127 loss to the Bucks. Terence Davis, Toronto Raptors: It will be interesting to see if Davis sticks in the Raptors\u2019 rotation, but at least for now, the Raptors will ride their undrafted rookie. Davis is efficient with his minutes, scoring in double-digits in four of his last six games. Consequently, Toronto won all four of those while dropping the pair he didn\u2019t. Kelan Martin, Minnesota Timberwolves: Another week, another undrafted rookie stepping up. This week, Martin had a pair of solid games running the point, putting up 14 points and six assists in Monday\u2019s win in Utah on Monday, then following that with 10 points and seven assists in Wednesday\u2019s home loss to Utah . This might be a rare outburst for the two-way player with Andrew Wiggins out and Jake Layman ailing, but he\u2019s clearly proven his worth and could see more playing time moving forward. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 20 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

A video tribute was played during a timeout in the second quarter and several of Deng\u2019s former Bulls teammates \u2014 including Joakim Noah and Ben Gordon \u2014 attended the game.

They were finally whole on Wednesday when Kawhi Leonard and Paul George shared the floor together, suiting up against the Boston Celtics. Before that, the only significant time spent in each others company in uniform was this summer when they were introduced as the newest and most important members of the franchise. It was an event that shook the league and made the Clippers the title favorites. Given the club\u2019s zero championships, that glowing projection had never been written or spoken by anyone before. And, predictably, the league will not be conquered in a day or more accurately, a night where the Clippers defeated a Celtics team holding the East\u2019s best record. They did so haphazardly (at times) before showing enough spunk in the fourth quarter and overtime to confirm their arrival as a team to be believed. Perhaps these sketchy performances will be expected from the Clippers here in the early season because George missed the first 11 games and Leonard six. Therefore, the Clippers will reek of training camp smell until their stars develop better harmony and the rotation gets in sync. Because at times in the 107-104 win over the Celtics , the Clippers passed up shots and were careless with their decision making and passing \u2014 perhaps in an effort to please one another. George and Leonard are the clear alpha dogs and not only were they too deferential to each other during stretches, so were their teammates, mostly to a fault. \u201cTwenty-three turnovers,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, with a sense of resignation. \u201cWe were so sloppy. We were trying not to get in each others\u2019 way. We need a lot of work. We\u2019re trying to get the ball to guys instead of trying to score.\u201d It\u2019ll take more practice sessions to clean that up and gain a clearer understanding of roles, situations and flow. Because of injuries, the Clippers, George and Leonard simply haven\u2019t had that chance. \u201cWe were thinking in the office earlier today if we ever had two (stars) getting ready to play in a game, and they never had one practice together,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t come up with one.\u201d Don\u2019t be misled, though \u2026 the Clippers\u2019 glass is not exactly half empty. There was another aspect to the Clippers in their sneak preview \u201copener\u201d that left much to be admired. They turn scrappy when cornered and fight when threatened. This was apparent when the Celtics snatched a 10-point lead late in the fourth and were rolling. In these situations, teams tend to discover what\u2019s in their DNA and whether their desire level belongs in elite company, even here in mid-November. The results show George is, at the very least, Leonard\u2019s equal as a scorer. Lou Williams can take over games \u2014 even from Leonard and George \u2014 when necessary. Pat Beverley never runs empty on energy or fire. And Leonard \u2014 as he showed last spring \u2014 always seems to deliver in the clutch with a decisive play. \u201cOnce we got started,\u201d Williams said, \u201cwe saw how special this team can be.\u201d Williams helped erase the Celtics\u2019 lead by scoring 13 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and caused major problems in the final few moments of regulation. He\u2019s a lethal scorer in his own right and in the 2019 playoffs \u2014 without George or Leonard around \u2014 he carried the Clippers late in games. George finished with 25 points and drew double teams, which created open shots for teammates. It has been a torrid start for him this season since returning from shoulder surgery and rehab. To date, he\u2019s scored 123 points in 110 minutes and hit the go-ahead 3-pointer vs. Oklahoma City on Monday. One of those who benefited from the extra attention given to George and Leonard was Beverley. The Celtics picked their poison and their scouting report, no surprise, told them to let Beverley beat them. Ordinarily that\u2019s the proper strategy as Beverley isn\u2019t a scorer and the ball usually does not find him in tense moments. But Beverley punished Boston with four 3-pointers (in seven tries) and was an all-around menace, with a career-high 16 rebounds, seven assists and two steals to go with his 14 points. His feisty tenor set the tone for the Clippers defensively late in the game as the Celtics and their highly efficient offense managed a tame 29 total points in the fourth quarter and overtime. \u201cThey were trying to leave guys open,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThey left Pat open. They took the risk. He single-handedly willed that game for us.\u201d At the OT buzzer, Leonard reached and deflected Kemba Walker\u2019s potential game-tying shot. The development of the Leonard-George combo obviously will play huge in whatever success the Clippers have this season. It seems a match made in basketball heaven given their styles and unselfish ways. They can shoot the mid-range or three. They can attack the rim \u2014 see Kawhi\u2019s poster dunk Wednesday that set social media ablaze \u2014 and bring the goods defensively. George is a four-time All-Defensive teamer while Leonard is a two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year. Leonard and George can take turns guarding the other team\u2019s big scorer, a luxury George didn\u2019t have in Indiana and Oklahoma City and Leonard lacked for much of his time in San Antonio (and all last season in Toronto). They can switch on and off in the same game. Expect to see this happen Friday when league scoring leader James Harden comes to town ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). Last week, Harden torched the Clippers for 47 points. This time, he\u2019ll see Kawhi in his grill for stretches and then get George, with a little Pat Bev thrown in for irritant\u2019s sake. The elephant in the room is Kawhi\u2019s health. Nobody expects him to play every game the remainder of the season, but he\u2019s already on pace to miss 30. In 2018-19, he missed 22 with the Raptors. The good news is the Clippers can win without him (provided George remains healthy). The better news is the Clippers are finally intact and complete, even though there are kinks to straighten, flaws to correct and a system that needs to be reset. \u201cWe want to figure out how to win games and then become a good team,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe\u2019re a work in progress.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The theme seemed appropriate for 76ers fans, because it was finally time to count Simmons\u2019 3-pointers. One! One 3-pointer for Ben Simmons! \u201cHold me back, fam!\u201d 76ers announcer Marc Zumoff exclaimed on the TV call. The anticipated shot didn\u2019t win a playoff or even big regular-season game. Simmons, though, got the weight of the ridicule for the career 0-fer off his back when he hit the first 3-pointer of his career and had 18 points and 13 assists to lead Philadelphia to a 109-104 victory over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. Mike Scott\u2019s fourth 3-pointer of the game with 1:29 left stretched the Sixers\u2019 lead to 99-95 and they held on after New York\u2019s Marcus Morris hit a pair of 3s in the final 10 seconds. Joel Embiid had 23 points and 13 rebounds, and Scott scored 12 points. The only shot that mattered in Philly was the 3 from Simmons, finally, in his 172nd career game and after nearly $19 million in salary. Simmons acted like it was no big deal. \u201cIt feels good, yeah. You put in work in the summer and it pays off,\u201d Simmons said. Simmons did the improbable when he fired a 24-footer from the corner in front of the 76ers bench and the shot was good, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Simmons received a lengthy standing ovation for the first 3-pointer after 17 misses (and one more miss in the postseason) to start his NBA career. The 23-year-old Simmons is an All-Star and franchise cornerstone for the Eastern Conference contenders, a triple-double threat each time out. But never a long ball threat, a fact that earned him derision around the league. He\u2019s been criticized for his lack of outside shooting, defiant at times about his weakness and spent the offseason working hard on improving his jumper. Simmons said at the start of training camp, if he\u2019s open for a 3-point shot, \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d \u201cOther people get more excited than I do,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cBut how can it not be a good thing? But if we\u2019re all honest, that\u2019s the first legitimate 3 that he\u2019s taken.\u201d Simmons sank a 3 against the Guangzhou Loong-Lions of China in the preseason that had Sixers fans treating the shot like he hit a winner in an NBA postseason game. Against the Knicks, Simmons took a bounce pass from Furkan Korkmaz and calmly drained the shot with 8:20 left in the first quarter. \u201cThere\u2019s Simmons. Yes! He did it,\u201d Zumoff said. \u201cMaybe now they\u2019ll finally leave him alone after that! He hits the 3! The first of his NBA career!\u201d He did it in front of everyone from fans that paid $8 on the secondary market for an upper deck ticket to Hall of Famer Julius Erving. Simmons\u2019 older sister and , Liv, clapped back at critics, tweeting, \u201cNow you can all shut the hell up\u2026.\u201d Maybe Dr. J can deliver that basketball straight to Springfield, Massachusetts. Simmons hit one 3; the four-win Knicks hit 11, and used a fantastic third quarter to take a 17-point lead. Morris led the Knicks with 22 points. Simmons even played peacemaker in a scrap between his teammate Embiid and Morris, a Jayhawk-on-Jayhawk altercation that had Kansas fans everywhere waving the white flag instead of the wheat. Morris dragged Embiid to the court late in the second quarter, and the Sixers All-Star center popped up in anger. Simmons pulled away his teammate to avoid a repeat of Embiid\u2019s brawl last month with Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns that earned him a two-game suspension. Embiid and Morris jawed at each other and each was hit with a technical foul. Morris also earned a flagrant. \u201cI just got thrown on the ground and I really don\u2019t know why I got a technical foul,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI\u2019m being the victim and didn\u2019t do anything. I feel like it\u2019s starting to get ridiculous with the flagrants.\u201d It\u2019s not the first confrontation between the two: Morris played for Boston when he was trash-talked by the theatrical Embiid. Morris held up three fingers to show Boston was up 3-0 in a 2018 playoff series. \u201cHe started it last year in the playoffs and he keeps going,\u201d Embiid said. They went back-and-forth in the fourth in Philly. Embiid thundered a two-handed jam off a turnover to tie the game at 82-all and put some life back in the Sixers only for Morris to hit a jumper for an 85-83 lead. \u201cHe be flapping. He was flapping and grabbing,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI\u2019m not the one that\u2019s gonna take that. He knows that.\u201d"},{"id":30472,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-losing-streak-playoffs-risk","date":"2019-11-21","title":"Spurs' losing streak, longest in 22 years, puts playoff run at risk","content":" The number 22 became pertinent to the plight of the San Antonio Spurs after they lost their seventh straight Wednesday, falling 138-132 to the Washington Wizards. The club\u2019s current seven-game freefall matches its longest in 22 years, dating back to Gregg Popovich\u2019s first season as coach, when the Spurs suffered through skids of seven and eight games. Perhaps most alarming is that San Antonio\u2019s NBA-record tying run of 22 straight postseason appearances might now be in jeopardy of ending in the ultra-competitive Western Conference. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating, especially being on this losing streak,\u201d said DeMar DeRozan, who led the Spurs with 31 points as one of the team\u2019s eight double-figures scorers. \u201cIt sucks to lose. On the streak that we are on, every single game that we have lost has felt worse than the last one.\u201d The Spurs certainly worked behind the scenes to prevent this outcome. Seeking an offensive spark after countless slow starts through the first 15 games, Popovich shook up the starting lineup Wednesday, opting for veteran reserve Patty Mills at point guard over DeJounte Murray, in addition to inserting Jakob Poeltl with the first team. The move netted a quick return, as San Antonio scored a season-high 69 points in the first half to go into intermission ahead six points. DeRozan and Bryn Forbes combined for 25 points on 8-of-13 shooting. \u201cYou know, we started out better. That\u2019s what we wanted to do,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cBad third quarter. All in all, if you score 132 points, you should probably have a pretty good chance to win a game. The bad news is if you give up 138, you\u2019re probably not gonna [win]. I\u2019m just a really smart guy. Yeah, I\u2019m figuring that\u2019s logical, right? You know, [giving up] 138 [points], it\u2019s probably going to be tough to win that game.\u201d Popovich finished those remarks and took only one question. He, like the rest of the Spurs, continues to search for answers. San Antonio hasn\u2019t lost seven straight since Feb. 23 to March 5, 1997, under Popovich, and the last time it had a longer drought was eight defeats from Nov. 15-30, 1996, under Bob Hill. It was during the next month that Popovich, the team\u2019s general manager, fired Hill and moved from the front office to the sideline. San Antonio finished 20-62, won the draft lottery and took Tim Duncan with the No. 1 overall pick. Washington inflicted most of its damage in the third quarter, thanks to 21 points from Bradley Beal, who produced his fourth-consecutive game with 30-plus points (33), the longest such streak of his career. The Wizards outscored San Antonio 38-29 in the third quarter, hitting a blistering 61.5% from the floor and 83.3% from deep (5-of-6). Beal shot 3-of-9 in the first half before catching fire in the third quarter. \u201cA guy like that, I think he had like six points coming out of halftime,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cA guy like that, you\u2019ve got to expect him to turn it up, even if he misses shots.\u201d Added Mills: \u201cNo matter what he shoots in the first half, you know he is going to come out smoking in the second half, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one. Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith and Moritz Wagner each knocked down 3-of-4 from 3-point range, while former Spur Davis Bertans hit 4-of-7. Troy Brown Jr. and Thomas Bryant also drained the only 3-pointers they attempted. The Wizards would finish the game shooting 60% from behind the arc, which ranks as their best percentage from range of the season, not to mention the highest percentage in team history in a game in which they launched 30 or more attempts from deep. Washington\u2019s 138 points ranks as the most against the Spurs in Wizards\u2019 history. San Antonio\u2019s latest setback marks the second consecutive loss in its current four-game road trip with matchups on the horizon Friday at Philadelphia, followed by a Saturday date with the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The competition only intensifies when the Spurs return to the AT&T Center on Monday to host the Los Angeles Lakers , which boast the league\u2019s best record (12-2). The concern now is whether San Antonio has dug itself into an insurmountable hole that threatens to swallow up prospects for a 23rd-consecutive postseason berth. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long season. We are worried about now. It\u2019s not like we are 50 or 60 games in. It\u2019s still early. Just as we are on this bad streak, we can start a positive streak as well.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Gasol, who never played in a game with the Blazers, announced on social media Wednesday that the team had released him. In a video he posted, Gasol said he is still recovering from surgery on his left foot in May. \u201cI underwent surgery in hopes that it would expedite my return, but unfortunately in the last few days we have assessed that my recovery is going to take longer than we had originally hoped for,\u201d he said. Gasol said he plans to remain in Portland to continue his rehabilitation, and he is discussing a new role with the Trail Blazers. The news was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The 18-year veteran posted a short video on Instagram letting everyone know that he\u2019s no longer a member of the Trail Blazers, that his rehab from foot surgery has taken longer than expected and that he expects to stay with the franchise in some capacity. \u201cI have the same excitement and passion for the game of basketball that I had when I first started playing, and I will work as hard as I can on my recovery with a clear goal in mind: To get healthy in order to continue to play the game that I love,\u201d Gasol said. Gasol signed with the Blazers in the offseason as a free agent. He played in three games for the Milwaukee Bucks last season before undergoing surgery for the stress fracture. The Bucks had signed him in March after he reached a buyout agreement with the San Antonio Spurs. In total, he played in just 30 games last season, averaging 3.8 points and 4.6 rebounds. A six-time All Star and 18-season NBA veteran, Gasol is among just four players with over 20,000 points, 11,000 rebounds, 3,500 assists and 1,500 blocks in his career, along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. He has a pair of NBA championship rings from a stint with the Lakers. Gasol\u2019s signing was meant to shore up the Blazers at center while the team awaits the return of Jusuf Nurkic, who broke his leg during a game in March. Portland is also depleted at the forward position after Zach Collins underwent shoulder surgery. The Trail Blazers this week signed 10-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony , who made his debut with the team on Tuesday night against New Orleans.

Contenders clash! (Part I): The Rockets\u2019 eight-game win streak has, not surprisingly, been fueled by offense (a category they rank No. 1 in ). Houston is taking that high-powered attack into Denver tonight ( 9 ET, League Pass ) to provide the first of four tests for the Nuggets\u2019 defense. The big challenge, of course, will be stopping James Harden. He is averaging 40.2 points per game this month and has made 92.2% of his field goals in November without an assist. 2. Contenders clash! (Part II): Paul George has gotten his 2019-20 off to a bang as his Clippers host the Celtics tonight ( 10 ET, ESPN ). He\u2019ll now get a chance to play alongside Kawhi Leonard, who is set to return Wednesday after missing the last three games with a knee contusion. With both stars suiting up, this is a matchup of two of the best overall offenses and defense in the NBA and is a must-watch game. 3. Bucks quietly in a groove:  While the Lakers, Celtics and Rockets have each piled up some impressive win streaks to date, don\u2019t overlook what Milwaukee is doing. The Bucks have won four straight and eight of their last nine as a game vs. the Hawks awaits ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). Milwaukee has the No. 1-ranked defense this month ( 97.7 Defensive Rating ) and center Brook Lopez is second in total blocks (22) this month, too. 4. The Luka Show rolls on: The last time Luka Doncic took the court, he made some history . He\u2019s generating Kia MVP buzz in some parts and has become perhaps the must-watch player of the season\u2019s early going. The Warriors visit ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ) and have the unenviable task of asking their defense \u2014 which is the league\u2019s worst overall and is soft in the middle \u2014 to slow a Doncic\u2019s roll. Catch this one if you\u2019re a Luka (or Mavs fan) \u2014 and avert your eyes if you\u2019re a Warriors fan. 5. Checking in on Kuzma: LeBron James was busy making triple-double history last night, but one storyline from the Lakers\u2019 win against the Thunder involved forward Kyle Kuzma. He left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion and didn\u2019t play the rest of the game. L.A. got some good news today, though, as further tests revealed Kuzma will be OK to play Friday in OKC ( 8 ET, League Pass ). 6. Injuries testing Nets\u2019 mettle: Kyrie Irving will not play against the Hornets tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), which, combined with Caris LeVert\u2019s absence, leaves the Nets with a suddenly thinning roster. The resilient Hornets have won two of their last three games and are quietly hanging around the lower seeds in the East in this early going. The Nets must tighten up their defensive rebounding and prevent scores off turnovers, two areas that have dogged them in November ."},{"id":30518,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kings-unveil-city-edition-uniforms","date":"2019-11-20","title":"Kings unveil new red City Edition uniforms","content":" Today, the Sacramento Kings unveiled the new Nike City Edition uniforms for the 2019-20 season with a refreshed look.

Barea on twilight of his career, playing with Dirk Nowitzki and more","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 J.J. Barea is an underdog story. A 5-foot-10 player from Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico probably shouldn\u2019t be in the NBA, let alone playing 14 seasons after going undrafted. But Barea has had quite a career, winning a championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 and, after three seasons in Minnesota, returning to Dallas to lead one of the league\u2019s best benches of the last few years. It\u2019s also rather amazing that, at 35, Barea is feeling strong just 10 months after suffering a torn right Achilles . He\u2019s healthy, but he\u2019s not playing. Barea provided a big spark for the Mavs in his first appearance of the season \u2014 scoring 11 points and dishing out three assists in 16 minutes in a win over Orlando on Nov. 6 \u2014 but went right back to being DNP for the last six games . Luka Doncic is the team\u2019s primary playmaker and Jalen Brunson is emerging as the backup point guard. With the Mavs also adding Seth Curry and Delon Wright in the offseason, Barea is out of the rotation. Barea spoke with NBA.com last week about the worst injury of his career, his chemistry with Dirk Nowitzki, accepting a diminished role, playing pick-and-roll, and his work \u2014 for which he won the PBWA\u2019s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award \u2014 toward the long recovery for Puerto Rico. * * * John Schuhmann: How are you feeling at this point? J.J. Barea: I feel good. Surprisingly, my body feels great. I feel quick. I\u2019m shooting the ball awesome. I couldn\u2019t move much, so I worked a lot on my shot this summer. But surprisingly, after the injury, I feel great. My quickness is there. My explosiveness is there. I\u2019m excited about how I feel and I just got to keep working. Was this the toughest injury you\u2019ve ever had? Yeah, this was the toughest. It\u2019s like starting from scratch. You got to learn how to walk, how to jump, how to move again. With this injury, you never know how you\u2019re going to feel, and I was a little nervous throughout. But then when I started getting better and started playing, I was like, \u201cOh, I should be OK.\u201d You grabbed your Achilles right away. Did you know it right there on the floor? A couple of plays before, it bothered me a little bit. But like always, I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out after the game. I\u2019ll put some ice and I\u2019ll talk to the trainer. We\u2019ll get some some treatment.\u201d And then when I came down on it, I knew I felt something weird and it wasn\u2019t the ankle. And when I touched it, I knew automatically. It was weird. I landed awkward and somebody hit a little bit of my leg. When did it set in that you would never again run pick-and-pop with Dirk? Pretty quick. That was a tough night. It was a quiet locker room when the game ended. Dirk came over, talked to me, gave me a hug, and I knew that was it for us. So it was a tough night. But we had an amazing year, so I was like, \u201cYou know what, we had a good run, and it was all good.\u201d You guys may have had the best chemistry among any pairing in the league over the last several years. It was unreal, man. The thing we had going when we came off the bench \u2026 Well, he started and then he subbed out pretty quick, and then came off the bench with me for the end of the first quarter, and we were on. Just \u201chigh four,\u201d automatically. With his look, I knew when he wanted the ball and when he didn\u2019t really want the ball. I knew some games, he wanted it 100% of the time. I knew some games, 75%. And I knew some games, 50. Sometimes, he would look at me like, \u201cJust go, go.\u201d And if I was making shots, he\u2019d make sure I kept being aggressive. But it gave me so much confidence playing with him. It was amazing. You\u2019re out of the rotation since your first or second year in the league. How tough is that to deal with? It\u2019s been tough. I\u2019m coming off an injury, so maybe it\u2019s a good thing that I get a little more time to get ready. But it\u2019s definitely tough. I\u2019m used to grinding and being in the fight with my teammates. But it\u2019s a different situation and I understand that we got a lot of guys here, a lot of young, good talent. I just got to be ready. I was ready the other day, they put me in, I did a good job. So I just got to stay ready and wait for my time. It is part of an evolution toward being a coach somebody? Yeah. I definitely keep learning. Obviously, I got a great relationship with [Mavs coach Rick Carlisle]. I just keep learning and I want to be on the coaching staff some day. In that Orlando game, there was one vintage J.J. Barea pick-and-roll , where Nikola Vucevic was in drop coverage and you kept the ball until the precisely right moment to throw the lob to Dwight Powell. What are you looking for on those plays? Dwight is super quick, so as soon as he gets a little behind the guy in front of me, it\u2019s over. I just got to mix it up. If they\u2019re too back, I got to look for myself. And if I make one, they\u2019re going to guard me the second time, so the lob is going to be open. Or if it\u2019s the lob [first], then I get my layup. I read it, because after the pick-and-roll, I know my guy is done. They\u2019re going over. So I read the big guy. And is that just years of experience? Yeah. That\u2019s experience. I\u2019ve been running the pick-and-roll since my second year with Avery Johnson. And every time I go in the game, as soon as I get in the game, the first play is a pick-and-roll for me. Over the years, I\u2019ve just gotten better and better at it. Are you trying to pass that on to these other guys? Oh, no question. Brunson can be really good. He\u2019s got the body. And Luka is just big, man. So I don\u2019t have to do too much with him. But the thing I\u2019ve learned, like I told the young guys, it\u2019s the setup. If I want to go right, I got to do something going left first. Anything. Look left, pump fake left, spin move left, and then go right. Where is Puerto Rico at in its recovery? It\u2019s taking some time. It\u2019s still a lot of work \u2026 streets, electricity. We were not doing that good before the hurricane, so the hurricane really hit us and it went all the way down. It must be frustrating, because you\u2019ve done so much , and there\u2019s still so much more to do. Yeah. And we had the politics problem. They were stealing a lot of money for years. But the hurricane, what it did, I think it woke up people that we need to get a little bit better. But we\u2019re delayed. We\u2019re like 10, 20 years delayed. And you\u2019re still pushing forward? My foundation is doing a good job. We stopped the sports [work] for a minute, but now we went back to sports. My foundation is doing basketball courts at public schools. That\u2019s our biggest project. So we just keep helping where we can. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The MSP Nike City Edition uniform pays homage to the two cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, the diverse people and neighborhoods that makes the Twin Cities thrive, and the river that divides yet unites its residents. The icy cool yet sky blue color of the new MSP City Edition uniform reflects the blue waters that are ubiquitous throughout the cities, namely the Mississippi River, which is outlined on the left side of the uniform. The river\u2019s outline begins at the collar of the uniform and flows south all the way down to the bottom of the uniform. An illustrative icon featured on the waistband of the shorts features the last city of the east, the first city of the west, connected by the mighty Mississippi River in an eye-catching design.

That seems to have liberated him to come back on his own terms when he signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. \u201cI came to a point where I was willing to accept it either way,\u201d Anthony said after playing the first game of his 17th season with his sixth NBA team on Tuesday night. \u201cI had to get myself mentally prepared for that and I did, to be honest with you. \u201cI stayed with it, but there was times where I didn\u2019t want to. I wanted to just say, \u2018Forget it, move on with my life, spend more time with my family.\u2019 I started getting more comfortable with that,\u201d Anthony continued. \u201cI come into this game with a totally different mindset, totally different motivation.\u201d Anthony\u2019s Portland debut \u2014 played across the street from where he led Syracuse to the 2003 NCAA championship \u2014 was not a triumphant one. He missed 10 of 14 shots, finished with 10 points, and the Blazers lost 115-104 in New Orleans. But Anthony was in good spirits when he exited the locker room and stood in a hallway, patiently taking questions and often smiling as he spoke introspectively about the significance of his first NBA game action since his unceremonious departure from the Houston Rockets a year ago, after appearing in just 10 games. \u201cThe greatest feeling of it all was to feel wanted by a group of guys who believe in me and my talent and what I can bring to the table,\u201d said the 10-time All-Star, who has averaged about 24 points per game during his career. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the players, it was the coaching staff. They showed a strong belief in me and what I can still do.\u201d He started right away, even before he\u2019d participated in a single full practice with the Blazers. He joined them the day after they\u2019d lost at Houston on Monday night, and approximately 72 hours after getting confirmation by phone that the Blazers were ready to sign him. \u201cThat was something that was established from the gate, when we had that phone call: Let\u2019s be transparent. That was a miscommunication over the last couple seasons over what my role would be and things that was expected from me, and that was a big point,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThere\u2019s not nothing I won\u2019t be willing to do, but just let me know up front. Whatever it is, just let me know, put it out on the table and let\u2019s go from there. \u201cThat was a big reason why I made my decision,\u201d Anthony added. \u201cIt worked. I\u2019m here. They had a vision. They had a plan and I was part of that plan. When it came down to it, I wanted to be part of that plan.\u201d Anthony said it was hard to tune out speculation over which teams might give him another shot during his year out of the game. \u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was one point where I told my agent: \u201cJust let me know when it\u2019s first and goal. Don\u2019t call me when it\u2019s first and 20.\u201d In the meantime, Anthony assured that he \u201cwasn\u2019t on the couch\u201d waiting for a call, but continuing to train. \u201cPhysically, as far as basketball goes, that comes easy to me,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI still have to put the work into that, but it was more of a mental and emotional challenge, more so than a physical challenge.\u201d For the time being, the 35-year-old Anthony is steering clear of setting expectations. \u201cWho knows? I don\u2019t think anyone knows what\u2019s going to happen this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here now. That\u2019s what\u2019s important. I could have still been home, right? So, Portland pulled the trigger. No matter what happens, I will always appreciate that. \u201cI have a new outlook,\u201d he added. \u201cFor me, where I\u2019m at, mentally, emotionally, the way I see things now, the way I approach the game, the way I approach this situation is more so me just having another different appreciation of just what this is and what the game of basketball brings.\u201d"},{"id":30520,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-becomes-first-post-triple-double-vs-30-teams","date":"2019-11-20","title":"LeBron James becomes first player in NBA history with triple-doubles vs. 30 teams","content":"LeBron James made triple-double history Tuesday night when he became the first player to post a triple-double against every team in the NBA. James collected 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the Lakers\u2019 112-107 victory over the Thunder at Staples Center. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to think about it.\u201d James said after Los Angeles\u2019 fifth straight win. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a pretty cool stat to know, and I\u2019m glad it happened in a win.\u201d The win Tuesday gave the NBA-leading Lakers their 12th win in their last 13 games as they completed a perfect four-game homestand. James was more surprised than thrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different statistic glared at him from the box score. \u201cCoach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, \u2018Congratulations,\u2019 and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,\u201d James said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to think about it. I just think it\u2019s a pretty cool stat to know, and I\u2019m glad it happened in a win.\u201d James has five triple-doubles in the Lakers\u2019 last 10 games, getting four in victories. There\u2019s a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly filled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the NBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career average. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest streak of his career. Russell Westbrook will have two chances to match the feat this season if he can register a triple-double against Oklahoma City. Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd is third on this list with triple-doubles against 28 teams, followed by Larry Bird (25) and Magic Johnson (24). James ranks fifth on the all-time triple-double leaderboard with 86, trailing Kidd (107), Johnson (138), Westbrook (141) and Oscar Robertson (181).

This uniform is a celebration of the people and neighborhoods that make Mile High Basketball and Denver unique. In 2018-19, the City Edition brought back the iconic rainbow design, and honored Nuggets basketball of the past, focusing on the alumni and players that shaped the program and the rich history of basketball in Denver. The design was inspired by the team\u2019s original Rainbow Skyline uniform which was worn by the team from the 1981-82 season through 1992-93. The original logo was created by fans. Carl Sheer, in advance of the 1981 season, created a fan contest in which anyone could enter, and Nuggets staff would decide on the winning design. In the 2018-19 season, the current update of the City Edition uniform was a joint project between the Denver Nuggets and NIKE. The new design is meant to honor the classic design while modernizing it to fit the Mile High City\u2019s advancement, evolution and modernization that is taking place in the present era. The front-runner was Scheer\u2019s logo that featured the Denver skyline set against the Rocky Mountains and included a rainbow-colored background which became known as the \u201cRainbow Skyline\u201d. The classic skyline uniforms were derived from this logo. The design was chosen because of the standout design that represented the vibrancy and growth of Denver that occurred in the 1980\u2019s. Perhaps the colorful logo has a bit of good luck behind it, from 1982 to 1990 the Nuggets made the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons whiles wearing the Rainbow Skyline uniforms. Last season, the return of the Rainbow Skyline uniforms marked 25 years since the design was originally retired as the team\u2019s main uniforms. The last time the Nuggets team wore the classic version of the uniform was for a one-night-only special event during Dikembe Mutombo\u2019s jersey retirement ceremony on Oct. 29, 2016. The Nuggets will don the Nike City Edition jersey during seven games this season that will make up the Skyline Night platform presented by Western Union, which will be a celebration of Denver neighborhoods which include: Adding to the uniqueness of the Skyline Night platform, Western Union has also created an augmented reality campaign to enhance the overall experience. Fans will be able to unlock a new dimension of exclusive player content by scanning the Western Union jersey patch on any Nuggets jersey with a smartphone. New content will be revealed via the patch at each Skyline Night game this season including behind-the-scenes views of the City Edition jersey release, a Nuggets holiday special, \u201cBe My Valentine\u2014Nuggets Edition\u201d and so much more!

Portland plays at New Orleans on Tuesday night ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). Anthony, 35, holds career NBA averages of 24.0 points (44.9% FG, 34.7% 3-PT, 81.1% FT), 6.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.0 steals in 1,064 games (1,056 starts) over 16 seasons with Denver, New York, Oklahoma City and Houston. Talk of Anthony heading to Portland surfaced late last week . Citing a \u201ctotally different\u201d approach to the game, Anthony took to YouTube on Monday to explain his decision to join the Trail Blazers, and how he continued to prepare for an opportunity even as his career hung by the thinnest of threads. \u201cI always kept my eye on Portland,\u201d said Anthony, who will wear No. 00 with the Blazers. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out at other times. But now it seems like a perfect opportunity. I just look at that team and say, \u2018This is what I can bring, this is where I can help.\u2019 It can only work if all parties see it the same way. \u201cWhat happened before is the past; I can\u2019t dwell on that. I learned from that. This happened at a point of time in my life where I do have a lot of clarity and understanding of different situations, just life. My approach is totally different.\u201d A 10-time NBA All-Star, Anthony, has been named to an All-NBA team six times and was the 2012-13 NBA scoring champion. As a member of the USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team, Anthony has won three Olympic gold medals (2008, 2012, 2016) and one bronze medal (2004). Originally selected by the Denver Nuggets with the third overall pick of the 2003 NBA Draft , Anthony attended Syracuse where he won the 2003 NCAA Championship as a freshman. Among all-time NBA leaders , Anthony ranks 19th in points (25,551), 21st in field goals (9,137) and 41st in three-pointers (1,362). He is one of 11 players in NBA history with at least 25,000 points, 6,900 rebounds and 3,100 assists. The forward has been searching for a team ever since he was traded away from the Houston Rockets after playing just 10 games last season. The Blazers were reportedly interested in Anthony in the summer of 2017. Portland guard CJ McCollum tried to woo him with a photoshopped Instagram post that showed the future Hall of Famer in a Blazers jersey. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Anthony\u2019s deal is worth $2.15 million should he remain with the team beyond the NBA\u2019s roster guarantee date of Jan. 10. Anthony fills a need for the Blazers, who are short-handed at forward. Zach Collins recently had shoulder surgery that is expected to keep him out for at least four months. Rodney Hood has been bothered by back spasms, but returned for the team\u2019s loss to Toronto. Center Jusuf Nukic remains out after breaking his leg in a game last month and isn\u2019t expected back until after the start of the new year.

A \u2018perfect\u2019 fit? We\u2019ll see \u2026: Last night\u2019s 132-108 loss to the red-hot Houston Rockets dropped the Portland Trail Blazers to 5-9, their worst start since 2015-16. Some help is on the way as Carmelo Anthony is expected to join Portland in New Orleans ( 8 ET, NBA TV ) for that game. In a video posted Monday, Anthony called this a \u201cperfect opportunity\u201d and it very well may be: the Blazers are a middling post-up and catch-and-shoot team (two of Anthony\u2019s fortes). 2. Opposite directions in the West: Golden State has fallen on tough times, off to its first 2-12 start since 1999-2000 (when the Warriors finished 19-63). On the flip side are the Memphis Grizzlies, who are 5-8 and have scored recent wins against the contending Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets. In either case, the Grizzlies and Warriors are refuting what many thought about them in the preseason \u2014 for good or bad \u2014 as they meet tonight ( 8 ET, League Pass ). 3. Can Lakers keep up with Rockets?: For the moment, the Lakers have the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference standings. However, the Houston Rockets have won eight in a row and are just a 1\/2 game back for that spot. The Lakers face the Oklahoma City Thunder next ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ), who gave the title-contending LA Clippers all they could handle on Monday. Standings chase aside, this one should be interesting if for no other reason than to reflect on past Chris Paul vs. Rajon Rondo battles . 4. Today in scoring history: Way back on Nov. 19, 1983 , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored his 30,000th career point in a win vs. Portland. He reached 30,000 points on a pair of free throws in the third quarter, becoming the second player ever (Wilt Chamberlain was the other) to reach 30,000 points.

Early on, this season is filled with them. Giannis Antetokounmpo is giving us an encore of his Kia MVP-winning 2018-19 season . LeBron James is turning back the clock and reminding us that age truly is nothing but a number where he\u2019s concerned. In Texas, Luka Doncic is raising eyebrows nightly in trying to fill the shoes LeBron will vacate someday as the NBA\u2019s most versatile jumbo point-forward. And there\u2019s also an old hand at work. James Harden is flirting with Wilt Chamberlain-like territory thanks to his 39.2 points per game . If he can keep this up, he has a realistic shot at averaging 40 ppg \u2013 something Chamberlain was the last player to do ( in 1961-62 and \u201962-63 ). Neither Michael Jordan nor Kobe Bryant, whose scoring feats Harden\u2019s are most compared to, did that. Four-time scoring champion Kevin Durant, the greatest pure scorer of this generation (before Harden), never did it either. Harden has scored 35-plus points in every game during the Rockets\u2019 eight-game win streak and shows no signs of slowing down. He said Antetokounmpo\u2019s narrative secured him the MVP last season. If Harden keeps his scoring streak up, it\u2019ll be hard for anyone to top the tale he\u2019s weaving. His name is Luka: Before you hit send on that email or @ me on Twitter, let me save you the trouble. Yes, his name is Luka and, yes, he\u2019s a bad man! November is Sabonis Awareness Month: The Pacers leaned in hard on Domantas Sabonis as a foundational player for them and he\u2019s rewarding that gesture with some career-best play. He\u2019s 8-for-8 on double-doubles this month and had a career-high 18 boards in Monday\u2019s win vs. Brooklyn. He\u2019s third in the league in rebounds (13.8 rpg), ranking among the likes of Andre Drummond (17.0 rpg), Antetokounmpo (14.0), Rudy Gobert (13.6) and Clint Capela (13.1). Player of the week(end): Welcome back, Paul George! The Clippers\u2019 other summer prize has softened the blow of not having Kawhi Leonard around after a monster (delayed) start to his season. His 70 points over the weekend was impressive on its own. That he\u2019s shown no signs of rust after missing all this time is perhaps most impressive. The Clippers at full strength with the reigning Finals MVP (Leonard) and last season\u2019s No. 3 Kia MVP finisher (George) as their anchors could be scary for the NBA\u2019s other teams. Now, let\u2019s get into your comments about last week\u2019s Kia MVP Ladder \u2026 * * * Why isn\u2019t LeBron at No. 1? From:  Mariano Pierri Nov. 18, 2019 | 7:08 p.m. Hello Mr. Smith, my name is Mariano and I\u2019m a die-hard NBA fan from Argentina. I\u2019ve been watching NBA on a daily basis for years and I\u2019ve always been interested in the \u201cMVP Ladder\u201d column that you write for NBA.com. I just read your last article there and I wanted to take the time to tell you that I found it much more accurate than the previous one, so good job! However, I found myself surprised for seeing LeBron as No. 2. I was pretty sure he would be at the top of the Ladder this week. So I would like to ask you how do you exactly determine who deserves each spot, meaning what\u2019s the criteria for this? Numbers? Wins? \u201cNarrative\u201d? I would appreciate an expert to explain this to me. * * * My response: Expert, huh? I like that Mariano \u2026 I think. But I\u2019m not sure why you assumed LeBron would be No. 1. The committee takes it down to the wire on the order each week, trying to consider the latest information on all of the candidates. There are strong cases to be made for players up and down the top 10 of the Ladder each week. LeBron at No. 2 is lofty territory, especially when you consider the competition. He\u2019s behind a player who is having a monster season of his own, and ahead of a few players who plenty of folks think belong in that No. 2 spot as well. From:  Anders Rasmusson Nov. 15, 2019 | 2:34 p.m. Hello, I was just wondering why you have Donovan Mitchell as tied for 7th in the rankings. I\u2019m a huge Jazz fan, and he\u2019s doing great this season. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s over Luka Doncic or arguably even Damian Lillard. However, I don\u2019t mind him being ranked there \u2026 I was just wondering why. * * * My response: With fans like this, Mitchell can\u2019t even win the popular vote.  From:  Landon Bangerter Nov. 15, 2019 | 12:28 p.m. Really like the new list, Sekou. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019ve given Kemba Walker the love he deserves. I actually think Harden is the MVP so far this season. He\u2019s been lighting it up, but I won\u2019t argue with you thinking Giannis is still the winner. I do really think you\u2019re underrating Anthony Davis quite a bit though. He\u2019s been terrific for the Lakers and deserves a lot more than just an honorable mention. With that being said, here\u2019s my MVP Ladder: 1. James Harden (Houston Rockets) 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) 3. LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) 4. Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers) 5. Kemba Walker (Boston Celtics) 6. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors) 7. Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) 8. Donovan Mitchell (Utah Jazz) 9. Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers) 10. Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves) And six more: Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat), Devin Booker (Phoenix Suns), Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers), Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets), Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics), Andrew Wiggins (Minnesota Timberwolves) * * * My response: You might be on to something Landon, maybe once a month I\u2019ll cede the controls to the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder to a keen observer such as yourself. Don\u2019t take the feedback personal. From:  Michael Roberts Nov. 17, 2019 | 8:23 p.m. Hi Sekou, I enjoy and thank you for your work as a journalist. However, I don\u2019t understand how you can put Pascal Siakam over Luka in the MVP ladder. The stats tell a different story and so did their game last night. I am not sure of Kemba, either, being above him, but I will concede on him since he\u2019s been so clutch for the Celtics and has helped them go back to being that well-oiled and balanced team that turned heads in the 2018 postseason. Is it because Luka is a just a sophomore? Or does it have to do with the Mavs\u2019 record? I look forward to hearing from you. Keep up the good work! * * * My response: Michael, it is a combination of things that led me to rank Siakam above Doncic, but mostly it\u2019s about each players impact on his team\u2019s bottom line. All the triple-doubles in the world don\u2019t necessarily impact winning (ask Russell Westbrook). Siakam has been the catalyst for the defending champs. A one-game snapshot is probably not a fair measure for any of these guys. But the consistency of that contribution over a 10-game stretch is much more appropriate, in my opinion. Doncic is on my list, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s nowhere to be found. The difference between places on the list are not all equal, if you follow me. (The distance between, say, No. 4 and No. 9 might not be as great as some think.) These are hard choices to make every week and it\u2019s more complex than just raw numbers. The goal is for these spots to reflect the performances these players deliver within the context of their respective seasons. Nothing more and nothing less. * * * From:  @P1STONS_FAN Nov. 15, 2019 | 2:28 p.m. How do you write an article like this and not mention Andre Drummond??? #NoRespect * * * My response: Check back Friday and you might see it again. From: Vatsal Trivedi Nov. 15, 2019 | 11:40 a.m. Ok, I see you\u2019ve fixed this today \u2026 Now #5! * * * My response: I\u2019m a man of my word, Vatsal. As pointed out in last week\u2019s mailbag , Siakam\u2019s omission from the first Ladder of the season was a mistake. I try not to make the same once twice if I can help it. From:  Roberto Aleman Nov. 12, 2019 | 3:04 p.m. Seriously? Luca and Pascal behind LeBron James when they have their teams in the first places with teams inferior to those of LeBron James. Is anyone surprised at the position of the Lakers when he was one of the favorites from the beginning? * * * My response: LeBron and the Lakers living up to the hype seems like a perfectly reasonable explanation for him being higher than either Luka or Siakam on the Ladder. This isn\u2019t the most surprising Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. From:  NjieGaindeh Nov. 16, 2019 | 3:06 a.m. Disagree!! Harden should be behind Giannis, Sekou. Harden is pretty much one man show and on a roll plus his team is winning . You can\u2019t have Bron over Harden. * * * My response: On behalf of Russell Westbrook and a solid supporting cast in Houston, I\u2019d like to disagree with your assessment that Harden is \u201cpretty much a one-man show.\u201d In fact, last I checked, Harden\u2019s the one playing with another Kia MVP this season. From:  Roberto Aleman Nov. 17, 2019 | 1:40 a.m. Seriously now being a passer in a team where you have Davis carrying him on offense and on the defensive side. What a change from last year to this. Brother Davis\u2019s entrance that impacts on both sides. Brother Davis leads in points, rebounds and blockin * * * My response: Robert, my man. How quickly you forget. LeBron made it clear when the Lakers acquired AD that he wanted things to run through the big fella . That\u2019s the same thing he said about Kevin Love in Cleveland (wink). While I appreciate the sentiment and certainly acknowledge how good AD has been this season, I don\u2019t think anyone can honestly say that someone else on that Lakers roster is more deserving of MVP mention than LeBron. From:  Anthony Duckett Nov. 17, 2019 | 12:40 a.m. Disrespect to Harden yet again \u2026 Sekou, you\u2019re better than this \u2026 * * * My response: There was no disrespect intended Anthony. A top-three slot for Harden seemed more than appropriate last week. And there\u2019s no doubt he could be on the rise given his most recent exploits. (And I hope you are right, about me being better.) * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

That changed Tuesday, when the former scoring champion and 10-time All-Star officially signed with the Blazers . Also, according to ESPN\u2019s Marc Spears, Anthony will start and play about 20 minutes Tuesday night against the Pelicans ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). Citing a \u201ctotally different\u201d approach to the game, Anthony took to YouTube on Monday to explain his decision to join the Trail Blazers, and how he continued to prepare for an opportunity even as his career hung by the thinnest of threads. \u201cI always kept my eye on Portland,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out at other times. But now it seems like a perfect opportunity. I just look at that team and say, \u2018This is what I can bring, this is where I can help.\u2019 It can only work if all parties see it the same way. \u201cWhat happened before is the past; I can\u2019t dwell on that.

The feat put him in extremely rare company, with only LeBron James, Doncic\u2019s childhood idol, putting up such a line at a younger age. https:\/\/www.nba.com\/games\/20191118\/SASDAL https:\/\/www.nba.com\/games\/20191118\/SASDAL \u201dIt feels like every day there are stats you don\u2019t know about, stats that you read about,\u201d Doncic said after Monday\u2019s game. \u201dIt\u2019s great to hit.\u201d Doncic\u2019s sixth triple-double of 2019-20 pushed his season averages to even more absurd heights at 29.5 points, 10.7 rebounds and 9.3 assists. The only player in NBA history to reach those thresholds over a full season? Oscar Robertson, all the way back in 1961-62. It\u2019s impossible to say if Doncic can maintain such ridiculous production. But given how consistent he\u2019s been through 13 games, coming off one of the more impressive rookie seasons in recent NBA history, anything seems possible for the 20-year-old prodigy from Slovenia. \u201cThis guy can do anything he wants to on a basketball court,\u201d Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said Monday night. \u201dHe\u2019s having one of those magical runs right now.

James Harden had just lit up the Portland Trail Blazers for a game-high 36 points Monday in leading a Houston Rockets\u2019 132-108 victory that pushed the team\u2019s winning streak to eight in a row. The brilliant performance actually caused a slight dip in Harden\u2019s season scoring average. \u201cFor him, he had a sub-par night,\u201d Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts joked. Harden entered the game averaging 39.5 points, but that number now sits at 39.2 . \u201cYeah, he had a bad game tonight. That\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m lost for words. What he does, you can\u2019t do that. I know before that I\u2019ve said he\u2019s the best offensive player I\u2019ve ever seen. Well, he is. I haven\u2019t seen everybody, and I haven\u2019t coached everybody. But he\u2019s so good at what he does. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen it like this.\u201d The Western Conference Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks, Harden produced his eighth-straight game in which he scored 36 points or more , which ties for the longest streak of his career. Harden also scored 36-plus points in seven consecutive games last season. D\u2019Antoni called Harden the best offensive player he\u2019s ever seen back in 2018, and the coach truly believes the former Kia MVP continues to improve. \u201cHe\u2019s added a step-back with the step-back from the step-back,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, laughing. \u201cThen he comes across half court. Anytime he comes across, if they\u2019re not there, he bangs them. If they\u2019re there, he goes around. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s incredible what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Everyone expected plenty of fireworks between Westbrook and Lillard, as they squared off for the first time since Lillard\u2019s game-winning buzzer-beater in Game 5 of the 2019 first round sent Westbrook\u2019s former team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, home. Instead, fans inside the Toyota Center witnessed a mostly one-sided affair with Westbrook exacting revenge. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re just in a stretch where they\u2019re playing really well, and we\u2019re still finding our way,\u201d Lillard said. Westbrook scored 28 points to go with 13 rebounds and 10 assists for his 141st career triple-double (his third as a Rocket), while Lillard struggled from the floor, hitting 4-of-15 for 13 points, in addition to committing a team-high four turnovers. Westbrook says he turned defense into offense, after struggling early to find his shot. Westbrook finished 9-of-26 from the floor and 3-of-11 from deep. \u201cPlaying off my defense is what I want to do. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve been doing all season long,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cI pride myself on doing that every single night, and the offense will come when it comes. If it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. As long as we win, that\u2019s all I care about.\u201d While the Trail Blazers reportedly plan to sign Anthony , it\u2019s still not yet official. Stotts did say Anthony would meet the team late Monday night when it lands in New Orleans ahead of Tuesday\u2019s game against the Pelicans. Anthony is expected to make his debut that evening in New Orleans ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). \u201cI\u2019m not really going to talk about Carmelo right now,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to meet us in New Orleans, and once he\u2019s a part of our team I\u2019ll answer questions about Carmelo.\u201d Portland hopes Anthony can provide a spark offensively for a team that has struggled to a 5-9 start. But don\u2019t expect Anthony to play the role of third-option savior. Nobody with the Trail Blazers is expecting it, nor should the fan base or Anthony for that matter. The Trail Blazers entered the game against the Rockets ranked last in assists. That plays a role in opponents showing a tendency to trap and blitz Blazers guards Lillard and C.J. McCollum. The duo needs a reliable threat to knock down catch-and-shoot buckets. Anthony might prove to be the perfect complement given that the other candidates for the job \u2014 Zach Collins, Jusuf Nurkic, and Pau Gasol \u2014 are injured. Capela sat out of two games while progressing through the concussion protocol, only to return against the Trail Blazers and cobble together an historic night. In addition to chipping in a season-high 22 points, Capela pulled down 20 boards for the fifth 20-point, 20-rebound outing of his career. Capela has tallied 20 rebounds in each of his last four games. The last Rockets player to do that, per Elias Sports Bureau, was Elvin Hayes ( Jan. 9-19, 1971 ). Interestingly, Hayes was in attendance for Capela\u2019s dominant night. \u201cI talked to him a little bit after the game,\u201d Capela said. \u201cHe congratulated me. I\u2019m just proud of that. Hopefully, I can keep going.:\u201d The Rockets out-rebounded Portland 58-44, marking the first time all season they outproduced the opponent by double-digits in that category. Houston finished 8-1 last season when it out-rebounded the opponent by double-digits. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Rockets try to keep rolling: Four high-scoring guards matching up? Check. A team (Houston) looking for eight straight wins ? Check. An update on the Carmelo Anthony situation? Maybe. Thanks to their seven-game win streak, James Harden and Russell Westbrook have the Rockets as the West\u2019s hottest team to date. They host Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum tonight ( 8 ET, NBA TV ) in a showdown featuring two of the West\u2019s best backcourts. Throw in some past playoff rivalries between the top players and this one should be a can\u2019t-miss. 2. Another big night for George?:  If you somehow missed it, Paul George\u2019s return (and subsequent sizzling start to) this season for the LA Clippers has been the stuff of legend. He had 37 points in 20 minutes on Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks, which came two nights after he went for 33 points in 24 minutes in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. The Oklahoma City Thunder bring a respectable defense into L.A. ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ), but it seems no one has had an answer for George so far. 3. Luka keeping Dallas in thick of chase: It is early \u2014 roughly 70-games-left-in-the-season early \u2014 for any team to be thinking of playoff positioning at this point. That said, the Mavericks are two games over .500 and in four of the last five seasons when they accomplished that kind of start, they made the playoffs. Luka Doncic is driving the bus for Dallas and quietly staying in the Kia MVP chase as the San Antonio Spurs pay a visit tonight ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). 4. Back at it for Boston: Win streaks, like records, were made to be broken. Boston found that out yesterday in Sacramento but there\u2019s no time to sulk. A matchup with the Phoenix Suns ( 9 ET, League Pass ) will pit two of the NBA\u2019s better clutch-scorers against each other. The Celtics\u2019 Kemba Walker ranks sixth in total clutch points scored (31), while the Suns\u2019 Devin Booker isn\u2019t too far behind (23 points). 5. Can Conley find a rhythm?:  The Utah Jazz are staying in the thick of the West chase, but may be starting to get concerned about point guard Mike Conley. Pick a stat \u2014 points per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, 3-point percentage, assists per game \u2014 and it is a career-low for him . A game against the Minnesota defense ( 9 ET, League Pass ) could help him though. The Timberwolves have allowed every team\u2019s starting guards to shoot at least 35.4% against them this season."},{"id":30608,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/1-1-matchups-watch-week-nov-18","date":"2019-11-18","title":"Five 1-on-1 matchups to watch this week: Karl-Anthony Towns vs. Rudy Gobert","content":" T he Houston Rockets finished last week as the NBA\u2019s second-hottest team behind the Boston Celtics, and they figure prominently in this week\u2019s most highly-anticipated one-on-one matchups, starting with a showdown Monday between Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, followed by a clash Sunday between James Harden and Luka Doncic. Here, we take a look at five of this week\u2019s most intriguing head-to-head battles:  Last regular season meeting: March 14, 2019 Gobert owns this matchup if we\u2019re looking at this purely from a win-loss perspective. The back-to-back Kia NBA Defensive Player of the year has captured victories in 11 of the 14 times he\u2019s matched up with Towns, but the Timberwolves\u2019 star ripped the Jazz for a double-double (26 points, 12 rebounds) the last time they met. In fact, Towns enters the week having scored 25 points or more in five consecutive games and in six of his last seven contests, while draining three or more 3-pointers in six of his last seven games. Towns logged a double-double vs. Utah in three of last season\u2019s four Jazz-Wolves games and, overall, he\u2019s averaging a career-best 26.8 ppg this season. Most of the damage inflicted by Towns in this matchup has come near the rim, where he shot 66.8% from fewer than five feet from the bucket. With Gobert protecting the rim, Towns\u2019 shooting percentage from that distance falls to 46.7%. These players averaged a double-double against one another over the 14 games they\u2019ve played.

In that instance, Lillard sank a buzzer-beating 37-foot 3-pointer to punctuate a 50-point night as Portland ousted Westbrook\u2019s Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 5 of the teams\u2019 2019 first-round playoff series . This time, we\u2019re dealing with different teams and different supporting casts. The struggling Trail Blazers capped last week with a come-from-behind win against the San Antonio Spurs, while Westbrook\u2019s new team, the Houston Rockets, got their seventh consecutive victory as he rested. Westbrook has improved his field goal percentage from last season and he\u2019s playing 32.8 minutes per game \u2014 his fewest since 2013-14. The Trail Blazers expect to receive some help with the reported recent addition of Carmelo Anthony , but it\u2019s unknown whether he\u2019ll be available for this matchup. The last time Lillard and Westbrook faced off in the regular season, Lillard had 51 points, nine assists and five rebounds while Westbrook tallied 37 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: April 5, 2017 The numbers point to Irving dominating this matchup, but don\u2019t put too much stock into it. The last time these two matched up regularly was during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons, when Rozier was playing in his first and second NBA seasons. Those two seasons, Rozier averaged just 1.8 and 5.5 ppg, respectively, over 17.1 mpg. Rozier is the starter (and replacement for Kemba Walker) in Charlotte and is averaging 16.9 ppg in 32.2 mpg. The Nets, meanwhile, just completed a five-game road trip Saturday with a 117-111 win over the Chicago Bulls without Irving, who missed the first game of his Brooklyn tenure due to an injured shoulder. This matchup represents the second in a three-game homestand for the Nets, and Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson has said he doesn\u2019t know whether Irving will return for the club\u2019s next three games. If Irving can\u2019t play, this matchup loses some of its luster. But Irving\u2019s absence could pit Rozier against Spencer Dinwiddie, who collected 20 of his 24 points Saturday against the Bulls in the game\u2019s final nine minutes . Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . Last regular season meeting: January 1, 2019 Two former teammates for half of last season square off. Butler\u2019s teams win the majority of the time in matchups against squads featuring Harris, despite the latter\u2019s teams capturing victory in two of the last three showdowns. Miami capped last week with a 109-94 win against New Orleans with Butler fighting through an illness to help the Heat to a 9-3 start, which ties for the club\u2019s best-ever start. Harris, meanwhile, missed 23 consecutive 3-pointers over six games before bouncing back on Nov. 15 in an overtime loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Harris hit 3 of 4 from deep that night, marking the first time he connected on a 3-pointer since Nov. 4 . In his last three games, Butler has tallied 32 assists to 10 turnovers . While efficiency hasn\u2019t necessarily been Butler\u2019s game as of late, you can\u2019t discount the plays he made on Saturday when it counted. Butler had four points, three rebounds and four assists in the fourth quarter and finished with a plus-nine. Overall, the Sixers have lost five of their last eight games. As a Clipper, Harris dropped 21 points the last time he matched up with Butler, who was a member of the 76ers back then. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference .  Last regular season meeting: March 10, 2019  We know, we know \u2026 Doncic is in just his second season. But something about this matchup makes you wonder how and whether the outcome might affect the Kia MVP race . Doncic put together a triple-double (31 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists) in a Nov. 1 showdown against LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. Roughly two weeks later, he became the second player in NBA history to log a triple-double at Madison Square Garden before turning 21 . Harden, meanwhile, lit up the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday for 49 points on a career-high 41 shots to lead the Rockets to their seventh consecutive victory. He entered the week having scored at least 42 points in four of his previous five games, and just missed 40 points when he had 39 against the New Orleans Pelicans on Nov. 11. The series between these two is even (2-2), with Harden winning the last time they met . Interestingly, Doncic and Harden both average nearly a triple-double against one another. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference .  Last regular season meeting: November 1, 2019 White put together quite the week last week, lighting up the New York Knicks for 27 points and walking off the court in Chicago to chants of, \u201cCoby, Coby\u201d after setting a franchise record for 3-pointers made in a quarter (seven) to set a franchise record. White followed that up with a 26-point night in a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Interestingly, White has the Bulls\u2019 fan base buzzing the way it did when Rose was still the city\u2019s beloved son. Rose, meanwhile, presided one of the more bizarre losses you\u2019ll see. The Pistons hit 50% from the field and 43% from deep on Friday, yet still fell 109-106 at Charlotte. Rose took responsibility for the loss, in part, because of a late turnover that paved the way for Malik Monk\u2019s game-winning shot . In all, Rose committed six turnovers in the loss. A four-day layoff should help Rose and the Pistons refocus after losing four in a row. We all know Rose will be motivated to perform against his hometown team (which took him No. 1 overall in the 2008 Draft ). This matchup of Bulls past vs. present should contain plenty of fireworks. These two have met before, with White\u2019s squad winning on Nov. 1 .

The same held true on Sunday night with Bryant sitting courtside to watch his old team blast past the Atlanta Hawks . Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna Maria \u201cGigi\u201d Bryant, watched as LeBron James powered the Lakers\u2019 122-101 romp that was never even that close. In a first quarter full of highlights, James\u2019 biggest play provided his first points. After JaVale McGee blocked Jabari Parker\u2019s shot, James grabbed the ball, passed to Danny Green and took the return pass for a slam dunk that brought the crowd to its feet two minutes in. James added two layups, a 3-point shot and a three-point play to help propel the Lakers to their 25-point lead with 3:17 still to play in the opening quarter. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to put on a show for him and give him a reason to be like, \u2018OK, we might come to another game,\u2019\u201c James said. The 34-year-old James said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d to play in front of Bryant, who helped the Lakers win five NBA titles during his 20-year career. \u201cI know he came to a game last year,\u201d James said. \u201cJust having him in the building, knowing what he did to this franchise, and for me and my teammates what it means to be a part of Laker Nation, the Laker family, it\u2019s a beautiful thing. I was one of the kids who had the chance to come out straight out of high school. He did it and I was just watching him. It\u2019s just so surreal for me, a kid from Akron to be able to have a guy like Kobe take time out of his day. Even at this point in my career it\u2019s still special.\u201d Per ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin , Hawks star Trae Young was delighted to hear that Gigi Bryant was there to watch him. \u201cIt was crazy because he told me his daughter is a huge fan of mine, and I\u2019m one of her favorite players,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy because I\u2019ll be watching her highlights, too. They pop up on my timeline.\u201d Bryant was shown on the big screen with 4:25 left in the first half and rose to acknowledge a standing ovation. That was just one of many instances in which the crowd revered having him in the building. The first such instance came in the first quarter when James shook hands with Bryant and then nailed a 3-pointer to give the Lakers a 24-5 lead. When Bryant snapped photos of Gigi with comedian Kevin Hart and Quavo and Offset from the hip-hop group Migos, the crowd in turn took photos of Bryant taking photos and cheered. Anthony Davis told reporters after the game that he was excited to have Bryant in the building for Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s great,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be playing here in such an iconic franchise and have the opportunity to do something great here. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be nothing compared to what Kobe\u2019s done here, but just trying to write my own story and take it game by game, year by year and just keep building.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":30549,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/leonard-knee-out-vs-hawks","date":"2019-11-17","title":"Kawhi Leonard to miss Hawks game with left knee contusion","content":" LA Clippers small forward Kawhi Leonard will miss tonight\u2019s game against the Atlanta Hawks (NBA League Pass, 10:30 ET) with a left knee contusion.

Coach Kenny Atkinson said he does not know if Irving will return for the Nets upcoming homestand. Irving had 17 points and nine assists in a loss at Denver on Thursday night after being listed as questionable before the game. He has played through some pain, obviously, Atkinson said. We just felt it was best that he doesn\u2019t play today to take care of it and get healthy for when we get home.\u201d Irving did not speak with reporters before the game. Atkinson said Irving took a pretty good shot to his shoulder at Utah on Tuesday and that hes day-to-day. Irving is sixth in the NBA in scoring average at 28.5 points. Its the first game the six-time All-Star has missed this season. Spencer Dinwiddie was listed in the Nets starting lineup to replace Irving."},{"id":30577,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/glen-rice-jr-arrested-new-zealand","date":"2019-11-16","title":"Glen Rice Jr. arrested after New Zealand bar incident","content":" WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP ) \u2014 Former Washington Wizards guard Glen Rice Jr. has been arrested in Auckland after an altercation in a bar, 10 days after joining the New Zealand Breakers in Australia\u2019s National Basketball League.

The 28-year-old is the son of three-time NBA All Star Glen Rice. He attended Georgia Tech but was dismissed by coach Brian Gregory in 2012 after multiple suspensions, the last involving a shooting outside an Atlanta nightclub. Rice was taken by the Philadelphia 76ers as the 35th pick in the 2013 draft but later traded to Washington. He was waived by the Wizards in January 2015."},{"id":30582,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-malik-monk-beats-buzzer-pistons-deep","date":"2019-11-16","title":"Horry Scale: Malik Monk beats buzzer, Pistons","content":"A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * The Hornets started slow and dug themselves an 11-2 hole after missing six of their first seven shots. Meanwhile, Andre Drummond had a double-double by halftime as the Pistons built a 65-51 lead. It didn\u2019t look good for Charlotte, which has now trailed by double digits in every game this season. But the young Hornets came alive in the second half, with Devonte Graham and Malik Monk leading the charge. Monk had the last word, knocking down a contested 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Hornets a 109-106 victory , which snapped a four-game losing streak. * * * DIFFICULTY: It\u2019s never easy to execute a play with just one second on the clock, but coach James Borrego devised a great set. Following a timeout, the Hornets threw several screens, with Monk flying around one near the top of the key. He caught a pass from Cody Martin and launched the winner over Drummond. GAME SITUATION: Marvin Williams hit a 3-pointer to tie the game at 106-106 with 23.3 seconds remaining. After Derrick Rose drove the lane and awkwardly threw the ball away with a second left, Charlotte took the ball at midcourt. CELEBRATION: Bedlam in Charlotte. Monk raised his arms in victory as the home crowd erupted. Teammates mobbed Monk at center court, while the Pistons walked off the court in disbelief. The party lasted for several minutes. GRADE: Monk\u2019s first two seasons in Charlotte have been underwhelming. This year seems different. \u201cEvery game is getting better and better, so hopefully I just keep going up,\u201d said Monk. \u201cI\u2019ve been working hard for these two or three years and I\u2019ve been waiting for my moment.\u201d And what a moment it was. 3.5 Horrys ."},{"id":30554,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/malcolm-brogdon-exits-sore-lower-back","date":"2019-11-16","title":"Malcolm Brogdon exits with sore lower back","content":" Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon exited Friday night\u2019s game in Houston in the first quarter with a sore lower back and did not return.

Or see a different perspective of that monstrous Giannis Antetokounmpo dunk. In a reversal of roles, NBA teams are bringing the video game experience back to the live action \u2014 one arena at a time. The Atlanta Hawks Friday will become the fifth NBA team to unveil significant financial investments into new 360-degree replay technology designed to eventually give fans the power to change the way they see the game. \u201cIt\u2019s the wave of the future,\u201d said Hawks vice-president of live experience Joe Abercrombie, who says the technology also is \u201cone more thing to give people a reason to come\u201d to the arena. The Bucks, Mavericks, Pacers, Wizards and now the Hawks are using the technology to package and replay highlights in the arena during games. The Bulls, who host the 2020 All-Star game, are scheduled to come online next month. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice. I especially like that up-above view,\u201d said Allen Hazlett a fan from New Berlin, Wisconsin, after seeing the new technology at Thursday night\u2019s Bulls-Bucks game in Milwaukee. \u201cI think it\u2019s an added benefit for the fans. For those that aren\u2019t here all the time, to see that, I think, really ups the fan experience for them. I don\u2019t think people realize until you go somewhere else and you don\u2019t see it how lucky we are to have this arena. Everything here is state of the art.\u201d The six teams have joined NBA partner Intel, which provides the technology for the new video replays. The process begins with 38 5K video cameras strategically located around arenas. The high-tech cameras work together, bringing 360-degree replays to in-game video boards, TV broadcasts and fans\u2019 devices through social media. It\u2019s the latest effort by teams to entice ticket-buying fans to come to new and renovated NBA arenas. Atlanta spent almost $200 million to renovate State Farm Arena; Milwaukee last year opened its $477 Fiserv Forum. \u201cFor us it was really a no-brainer,\u201d said Matt Pazaras, the Bucks\u2019 senior vice president for business development and strategy. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like seeing a Giannis dunk live, and if we can supplement that experience with this technology, great. But if people are experiencing the Bucks wherever they are, hours away or thousands of miles away, we can still make the experience better.\u201d NFL fans already have seen 360 replays on TV. Those replays start from the traditional side camera before swinging around to bring the viewer behind the quarterback. Not that the NFL was first in line. Gamers have been manipulating all-angle replays for years. Video game-savvy kids may roll their eyes when their parents come home from NBA games eager to share their stories about their first looks at 360-degree replays. Those video games were designed to mimic the real games. Now it\u2019s time for some role-reversal. Rich Green, Intel\u2019s director of sports, said popular video games Madden NFL 19 and NBA 2K20 \u201chave camera angles and if you do replays, you can spin the camera around.\u201d Added Green: \u201cNow we\u2019re going to have that in live games. Now they can watch their favorite player and follow just him. It increases their level of engagement.\u201d The new technology isn\u2019t just for the fans. Coaches and scouts can make use of the enhanced replays to improve player evaluations. \u201cI think the future of this is going to weigh heavy for basketball operations and player development,\u201d Abercrombie said. Players now have better tools to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. Abercrombie said players who take dozens of shots in a practice can now study their shooting form in a new way. \u201cPlayers have asked \u2018Can I shootaround and you take a look at the way I\u2019m shooting and I want to spin around and take a look at the way I\u2019m releasing,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou think about traditional coverage of a game, there\u2019s only four angles. Two on the floor and two up. \u201cWhen you think about 360 view and repetitive shooting over and over again, they can say \u2018Oh, I see where my tendencies are.\u2019\u201d Hawks CEO Steve Koonin, a former executive at Turner Entertainment, says TV sports leaders have dreamed for years of the day fans could control the way they watch a game. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reading for years that \u2018You can be the director,\u2019\u201d Koonin said. \u201cActually, you can do that with this. The capabilities are unbelievable. \u2026 We think it\u2019s the next generation of sports media.\u201d Green said there is more to come as new ways to utilize the technology will be found that are not yet possible. Green said such high-tech terms as \u201cvoxels\u201d \u2014 similar to pixels in the 3D age \u2014 and \u201cvolumetric video\u201d will become common. He said fans will be able to follow a game from the viewpoint of their favorite player. \u201cHow you watch a play could be completely different from how I watch it based on how we control what angle we want to see,\u201d Green said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re just scratching the surface.\u201d * * * Associated Press freelancer writer Rich Rovito in Milwaukee contributed to this report."},{"id":30573,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-bill-russell-finally-accepts-hall-fame-ring","date":"2019-11-16","title":"Bill Russell finally accepts Basketball Hall of Fame ring","content":" SPRINGFIELD, Mass.

Today, it carries a degree of historical significance that is rather uncomfortable and maybe unfair for Jamal Crawford. Only one player in NBA history scored more points in Game No. 82 and did not play the following season. In that instance, Kobe Bryant was OK with that as he retired after dropping 60 on the Utah Jazz to close out the 2015-16 season. Meanwhile, Crawford is most definitely not retired, at least not willingly, as he waits to see if that last ballistic game was in fact the last he\u2019ll ever play in the NBA. Officially, he\u2019s currently living in Seattle, where he was raised and always maintained a home throughout his career. But metaphorically he\u2019s residing in a basketball Twilight Zone that annually collects veterans in their, well, twilight. They\u2019re not done playing \u2014 at least in their minds \u2014 and feel fresh enough to extend their careers by another year or two. Yet their fate is being controlled by a season that already began and 30 teams who don\u2019t have an opening for a proven veteran. Unless, of course, there\u2019s an injury or a sudden change in philosophy or, in the case of the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday, a twinge of desperation. A 4-8 start prompted the Blazers to reach a deal with one of Crawford\u2019s fellow residents, Carmelo Anthony. He spent the summer and most of the fall waiting by the phone and wondering if his time had passed. Crawford tweeted out support for \u2018Melo and for Iman Shumpert (who signed with the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday ). In a sense for these veterans, this is like the NBA Draft green room all over again \u2014 you\u2019re happy the room is emptying \u2026 but you don\u2019t want to be the last one sitting at the table. \u201cI know I can play,\u201d Crawford told NBA.com, \u201cand I would think my reputation is still solid. It\u2019s baffling to me.\u201d If you go strictly on how he finished with the Phoenix Suns last season, it\u2019s bizarre that not only is Crawford not in the league, but that he\u2019s not prominently in some team\u2019s rotation. Crawford played (as a reserve) in four of the Suns\u2019 five April games last season, scoring 19, 28, 27 and 51 points while shooting at an extremely healthy clip. If this was a showcase for 2019-20, albeit at a small sample size, Crawford proved he had something left even after 19 seasons. But the July free agency period came and went without a text message. The season tipped off in October without Crawford on a roster for the first time since the 2000-01 season. Almost a full month later, the three-time Kia Sixth Man Award winner is still watching from home. It\u2019s the first time since he began playing organized basketball as a kid that he isn\u2019t wearing a uniform in November. This isn\u2019t restricted to Crawford as every year players with NBA experience must watch the basketball world spin without them. Anthony and Shumpert were just lifted off the pile and yet the list of players waiting by the phone, once again, is lengthy enough . \u201cA lot of teams take a wait and see approach, not only for me, but vets in general,\u201d Crawford said. The group includes, among others: Kenneth Faried, Devin Harris, J.R. Smith, Corey Brewer, Jodie Meeks, Joakim Noah, Jonathon Simmons and Dante Cunningham. Most already had their big contracts, so making money is no issue for them. That\u2019s a good thing, too, because team salary-cap space is, for the most part, swallowed up at this point. Of course, the obvious concerns held by teams with most of these players are age and declining skills. The NBA is an unforgiving league that doesn\u2019t give tenure. If the decision to keep a young player or a veteran is a toss-up, some teams \u2014 especially those needing bodies in their player development program \u2014 will lean toward the young. Crawford was caught in between last season as the Suns were yet again rebuilding while also needing solid-character veterans in the locker room. Tyson Chandler, Trevor Ariza and Crawford served those mentor roles until a sudden philosophical shift hit barely a month into the season. Ariza was traded to Washington , Chandler was bought out and the Suns went full-blast young with Crawford averaging 18.9 mpg (his lowest since 17.2 mpg in 2000-01). \u201cI guess everything changed,\u201d he said. The Suns used Crawford at point guard, not his natural two-guard position. As a result, he didn\u2019t average double-digit scoring for the first time since his sophomore season. The silver lining is that he remained fresh and preserved his body for a possible 20th season. And of course, he had the energy for that 51-point game. In that April 9 game against Dallas, he shot 18-for-31 and 7-for-13 on 3-pointers in a 120-109 loss . The game carried no other significance except for it being the last one played by the great Dirk Nowitzki. Crawford\u2019s output was almost forgotten in that sense. But because he\u2019s not on an NBA roster right now, that 51-point performance could become the ultimate trivia answer. \u201cI\u2019m kind of an outlier because you don\u2019t see anyone my age having games like that,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cAnd I did it off the bench. A year earlier, in my 18th year, I was still averaging double figures. I can bring a multitude of things. I\u2019ll be ready for whatever team decides how I can fit into what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d At 39, NBA teams will express concerns about his defense, which is usually the first area that suffers when players age. But players at this stage are used in spot situations anyway, and mainly by contending teams looking for depth and experience. The problem for Crawford and others like him is the numbers game; only a few of these spots open every season. \u201cPhysically, I feel better than I did last season,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to get my body together. My skill set is sharp. I feel that I\u2019m good. My mindset is be patient and hopefully something good comes about it. I\u2019ll be ready for the opportunity.\u201d Until then, Crawford and others must live a surreal experience for them, though not all of it is bad or uncomfortable. There are kids to take to school; Crawford has three and is also afforded the rare chance to watch their youth games, too. \u201cI\u2019ve missed a lot of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s cool because they enjoy that, too. I\u2019m making up for that this time. I\u2019m the Uber driver.\u201d  Beyond that, he stays connected to the NBA but only from a distance. \u201cIt\u2019s weird watching games and being apart from it but seeing teams that could use you in certain situations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see where you could help different clubs in different ways.\u201d For Crawford, it\u2019s the love of the game, not a need for anything beyond that, which drives him. He\u2019s the ultimate gym rat who not only hosts a pro-am league in Seattle every summer, but he plays in it, too. There are also legendary stories of Crawford randomly showing up at local parks and gyms for pickup games, something you don\u2019t normally see from players, especially those with nearly two decades of NBA tread. The most famous Crawford cameo: Years ago, then with the Bulls and fresh off the team bus, he appeared at his favorite Seattle park and played pickup ball for three hours the day before a game with the Sonics. The next night, he scored 31 points. \u201cI love the game and stay in the gym anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I retire, I\u2019ll still be playing the game, whether that\u2019s at an LA Fitness or somewhere else. At this point, the regular players around here are kind of used to seeing me, although sometimes I\u2019ll go to a different gym and people are surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, the other night, I went to new one and played from 10 o\u2019clock to midnight. They did double takes.\u201d Were they surprised Crawford was actually at their gym, or that he\u2019s not somewhere in the NBA instead? The man who scored 51 in his last NBA game laughed at that. \u201cProbably a little of both,\u201d he said. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Players across the league are excited, including veteran Jamal Crawford, who is still eyeing a return himself . That led us to look at 11 veterans who are still waiting for a call. 1. Jamal Crawford : In the final game of last season, he scored 51 points , a rather remarkable distinction just by itself. Meanwhile, he waits to see if that last ballistic game was in fact the last he\u2019ll ever play in the NBA. 2. J.R. Smith : He has a laundry list of issues, yet above all, Smith has useable skills, even now. He\u2019s valued for 3-point shooting and defense. Yet, after being told by the Cavs to stay away last season, his past may have finally caught up to him. 3. Kenneth Faried : Surprisingly, Faried isn\u2019t on a roster despite being 29. His last three seasons, however, have seen a dramatic drop-off from his peak with the Nuggets earlier this decade when the Manimal was a double-double player. Faried reportedly signed a deal to play in China earlier this month. 4. Corey Brewer : A fluid and flexible wing who\u2019s just 33. He brings reasonably solid defense although he has never been a prime scorer and his 3-point shooting in particular is spotty \u2014 just 28% for his career. Brewer last played for the Sixers and Kings last season, appearing in 31 games. His last job as a rotation regular was with the Rockets in 2015. 5. Joakim Noah : After years of dealing with injuries and a suspension, Noah found life with the Grizzlies last season, scoring 22 points with 11 rebounds in one game. But he\u2019s 34. Hard to believe, but he was a Kia MVP candidate several years ago. 6. Jonathon Simmons : Two summers ago he signed a free agent contract with Orlando. But after being dealt to Philly in the Markelle Fultz trade and then dealt again to Washington and released by the Wizards this summer, Simmons has yet to get the call. Springy and athletic, he\u2019s probably headed back soon. 7. Raymond Felton : A solid setup point guard even during his declining years, Felton had solid backup roles with the Knicks and Thunder as of late. There were questions about his conditioning even during his prime years, however, and more now at age 35. 8. Devin Harris : A smart point guard who has seemingly been around forever, Harris had meaty seasons with the Mavericks but hasn\u2019t been a regular starter since 2012. Good shooters are always in some level of demand, which is why Harris has found work since 2004. 9. Quincy Pondexter : Injuries have interrupted his career numerous times: hamstring, knee and foot. He played for the Spurs last season but saw just five minutes a night. 10. Dante Cunningham : A hustling energy player who has never been a regular starter in his career, yet is valued for his willingness to play a role. He played the last two seasons with three teams: Brooklyn, Spurs, Pelicans. 11. Jodie Meeks : The best 3-point shooter by far in this bunch, Meeks had good timing if nothing else \u2014 he signed with the Raptors four months before they won the NBA Finals and therefore earned a ring. He\u2019s a lifetime 37% shooter from deep. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

Celtics seek 10th straight win: Long win streaks to open a season are nothing new to the Celtics under coach Brad Stevens. Back in the 2017-18 season, Boston started 0-2 \u2026 and then won 16 straight games . Tonight the Celtics visit the injury-plagued Golden State Warriors ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) in search of their longest win streak since that 2017 run. So far this month, Boston ranks No. 2 in effective field goal percentage while Golden State has the NBA\u2019s worst Defensive Rating (116.6). 2. Rockets\u2019 challenging stretch continues: Out West, the hottest team is the Houston Rockets, who have won five in a row as they get ready to host the Indiana Pacers ( 8 ET, League Pass ). During that five-game run, the Rockets have amassed the best Defensive Rating in the NBA . However, the Rockets have been a below-average rebounding team so far and have to find a way to keep the Pacers\u2019 Domantas Sabonis (14.5 rpg) off the glass. 3. Spurs off to a slow start: At 5-6, San Antonio is off to its worst start since starting back-to-back seasons with that mark in 2008-09 and \u201909-10. In those other two instances, San Antonio managed to win 50 or more games and make the playoffs. However, to get back to that spot, the Spurs have to start tonight in Orlando ( 7 ET, League Pass ) by tightening up a defense that ranks in the bottom half of the NBA. 4. Welcome back, Mike: Twelve seasons, 11,733 points, 4,509 assists and 788 games played. Those are just some of the numbers Mike Conley amassed as a consistent force for the Memphis Grizzlies. Now the point guard for the Utah Jazz, Conley takes his first trip back to the old Grindhouse ( 8 ET, ESPN ) to see his replacement, rookie Ja Morant , for the first time. From the memories of the \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d-era teams to a veteran vs. youngster matchup at the point, this game is one to catch. 5. The day Elgin scored 71 \u2026:  Back on this date in 1960, Los Angeles Lakers legend Elgin Baylor tallied 71 points, an NBA record at that time, in a 123-108 victory over the Knicks in New York. But Baylor\u2019s record lasted less than two years as Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points against New York on March 2, 1962."},{"id":30611,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-avery-bradley-leg-out-1-2-weeks","date":"2019-11-15","title":"Lakers' Avery Bradley (right leg) out 1-2 weeks","content":" Lakers guard Avery Bradley is set to miss some time with a right leg injury. \u201cAn MRI last night revealed a hairline fracture in a non-weight bearing bone of Avery Bradley\u2019s right leg (on the fibular head),\u201d the team said is a statement. \u201cBradley will be re-evaluated in 1 to 2 weeks, and further medical updates will be provided at that time.\u201d Bradley has started all 10 games he\u2019s played in this season, registering 9.6 points and 3.2 rebounds in 27.4 minutes."},{"id":30668,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/friday-notebook-donovan-mitchell-pacers-joel-embiid-chris-paul","date":"2019-11-15","title":"Friday's notebook: Donovan Mitchell's mid-range game in tune","content":" Happy Friday! We are more than 1\/8 of the way through the 2019-20 NBA season. Here are five noteworthy numbers and plays as we head into the Week 4 weekend. * * *  Donovan Mitchell has been a more efficient player this season. In his third year, both his *true shooting percentage (from 53.7% to 57.1%) and his assist\/turnover ratio (from 1.48 to 1.73) are career-high marks . * True shooting percentage \u2013 PTS \/ (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA))) \u2013 is a measure of scoring efficiency. But interestingly, Mitchell hasn\u2019t been more efficient because he\u2019s shooting more off the catch with the Utah Jazz\u2019s upgrade at point guard. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the percentage of Mitchell\u2019s jump shots that have come off the catch is actually down from 27% last season to just 19% this season. Mike Conley has assisted on seven (13%) of the 56 buckets that Mitchell has in the 220 minutes that the two have been on the floor together. Just as interesting is that Mitchell has seen a pretty dramatic drop in the percentage of his shots that have come from the most efficient areas of the floor. Only 47% of his shots have come from the restricted area or 3-point range. That\u2019s the *seventh lowest rate among 116 players with at least 100 total field goal attempts and down from 61% last season. * The six players with a lower percentage of shots that have come from the restricted area or 3-point range: DeMar DeRozan (29%), LaMarcus Aldridge (39%), Kawhi Leonard (39%), Derrick Rose (41%), T.J. Warren (41%), and C.J. McCollum (46%). But Mitchell has shot better from beyond the arc ( 41% ) and has thrived in the mid-range. He has shot 26-for-49 (53.1%) from between the paint and the 3-point line, the fifth-best mark among 47 players with at least 25 mid-range attempts through Thursday. That\u2019s also an increase from his 40% mark last season . Among 45 players who have averaged at least five pull-up jumpers per game, only Warren (55%) and Brandon Ingram (50%) have shot better on them than Mitchell (48%). Time will tell just how sustainable those percentages are. Even with Mitchell scoring more efficiently, the Jazz rank 23rd offensively , having scored just 104.5 points per 100 possessions (and just 92.9 with Mitchell off the floor). Still, Mitchell and the Jazz have won four straight games and scored almost 118 per 100 over the last two. They look to make it five straight when they visit Memphis on Friday ( 8 ET, ESPN ). They\u2019ll then have the rest of the weekend off before playing Minnesota ( 9 ET on Nov. 18 ) in an interesting home-and-home series. The teams are currently separated by one game in the standings and feature a great center matchup.  The Indiana Pacers have been the league\u2019s most pleasant surprise outside of Phoenix. Heading into the weekend, the Pacers are 7-4 and are one of two teams that rank in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They\u2019ve done this without Victor Oladipo and Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb and Domantas Sabonis having missed seven, six and two games, respectively. The Pacers\u2019 11 games have come against teams that are currently no better than 4-7 (there are five 4-7 teams in the East through Thursday). Still 7-4 is a strong start, given all the injuries and the lack of continuity from last season (Indiana lost five of its top seven guys in total minutes played ). The only two Pacers who have started all 11 games are guys \u2014 Malcolm Brogdon and Warren \u2014 who were on the Bucks and Suns last season. But through Thursday, no player has more assists to a single teammate than Brogdon has to Warren. The Pacers finally face some tougher competition this weekend . They visit the Rockets on Friday ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and then host the Bucks on Saturday ( 7 ET, League Pass ). But 8 of their 10 games after that are against teams currently under .500. It\u2019s nice to be in the Eastern Conference.  Almost all end-of-game plays are drawn up for guards or wings to run a pick-and-roll, isolate, or maybe shoot off the catch. Even if you have a go-to big man, getting him the ball close to the basket in an end-of-game situation can be difficult. But three times now, with less than 24 seconds left in the game, Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown has drawn up plays to get Joel Embiid the ball within a few feet of the basket. It has worked to perfection two of the three times. On the third, the officials called a foul on Embiid that was deemed incorrect in the Last Two Minute Report , which said that Embiid should have been heading to the free-throw line for the game-winning free throws after a foul on Nikola Jokic. The below video is a compilation of the three plays\u2026 Overall, Embiid has taken a greater percentage of his shots from outside the paint (48%) than he did last season (41%). He has shot better on those outside shots (effective field goal percentage of 47%, up from 41%), but he\u2019s obviously most effective inside, where the Sixers have been able to get him the ball with the game on the line. Embiid and the Sixers complete a three-game trip this weekend, visiting Oklahoma City on Friday ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and Cleveland on Sunday afternoon ( 3 ET, League Pass ).  Through Thursday, the league has taken 37.2% of its shots from 3-point range, on pace to set a record in that regard for the 9th straight season. Here are the players who have seen the biggest increase in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range. Only four of the 10 guys above changed teams this summer, though another two (Nance and Bogdanovic) are playing under new coaches.  It\u2019s always important to watch games closely. And sometimes, it\u2019s important to listen closely as well. That was the case when Chris Paul pulled up for a short jumper late in the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s victory over the Golden State Warriors this past Saturday. Make sure your sound is on\u2026 Yes, that was Paul himself yelling \u201cLayup!\u201d as he let go of the shot. Now, more than 20 years of shot location data tells us that shots in the restricted area are made about 60% of the time. But once you get outside the restricted area, league-wide field goal percentage drops to about 40%. So no shot that isn\u2019t a layup is really a \u201clayup.\u201d But that shot that Paul made against the Warriors was recorded as a 12-footer . A deep dive into Paul\u2019s shooting numbers shows that, over the last five-plus seasons (since the start of the 2014-15 season), he\u2019s 96-for-157 (61%) from 12 feet out. So when Paul yelled \u201cLayup!\u201d on that particular 12-footer \u2026 he was right. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

In this season\u2019s first 11 games \u2014 and in last season\u2019s MVP run \u2014 he\u2019s been relentless, which is why he remains No. 1 on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. But is he built for that other MVP, the Finals MVP? Does he have what it takes to drive the Bucks to the top of the playoff heap? No one doubts he\u2019s capable. Having a Finals MVP and a regular season MVP vaults one into a different category. That\u2019s the way it worked for LeBron James, who won two of his four Kia MVPs in Cleveland ( 2009 and 2010 ) before winning his first title in Miami in 2012, when he collected back-to-back Kia MVPs and Finals MVPs ( 2012 and 2013 ). Kevin Durant won his Kia MVP in 2014 with the Oklahoma City Thunder \u2026 and then won back-to-back Finals MVPs with the Golden State Warriors ( 2017 and 2018 ). \u201cI think the MVP award shouldn\u2019t just be for the regular season anyway, I think it should go all the way through the postseason,\u201d said Brian Shaw, who won a combined five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers as a player and assistant coach. \u201cAnd I say this from experience. There are a lot of people who win awards and then when the playoffs come around, they can\u2019t be found.\u201d Shaw wouldn\u2019t name names, but he was mostly talking about what he referred to as the true measure of the league\u2019s best player. He said in his playing career ( 1988-2003 ) there was never a doubt among players who the league\u2019s best player was. The one holding the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, though, was often not one in the same. To Shaw, one of the NBA\u2019s great travesties is that Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant \u2014 his former Lakers teammates \u2013 have more combined Finals MVPs (three for O\u2019Neal; two for Bryant) than MVPs (one each). \u201cYou don\u2019t crown a winner of the Kentucky Derby every lap or halfway through the race,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cYou let it all play out and then you know who the real winner is. I was on teams with these guys and I watched them do what real MVPs are supposed to do when it\u2019s all on the line. Can we go to you with everything on the line and say, \u2018Bring us home?\u2019 That\u2019s when it\u2019s real.\u201d Many variables can shape the MVP chase and much can be manipulated in a data-driven game. Certain players in systems tailor-made for their skill sets get to exploit the league, crafting narratives that make it impossible to overlook the results of a marathon-like season. \u201cBut at the end of the day, as far as the ultimate prize and the ultimate goal of winning a championship or at least playing for one,\u201d Shaw said, \u201ca lot of those guys [with Kia MVPs] never got there. The numbers are cute and all, it\u2019s cool. But if you walk away with that real prize, then you know you really did something.\u201d * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats: 30.5 points, 14.5 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 1.5 blocks, 1.5 steals Antetokounmpo is on a roll right now that has seen him average 35.1 points over his past six games. To date this month \u2014 which includes Thursday night\u2019s 38-point, 16-rebound, four-assist, three-steal effort vs. Chicago \u2014 Antetokounmpo is averaging more points (34.3) than minutes (34) per game. That\u2019s pretty good for a guy whose offensive arsenal is still under construction. Last week: No. 2 Season stats: 23.9 points, 11.1 assists, 8.0 rebounds, 1.1 steals Those Magic Johnson comparisons look better than ever now that James is in full-blown facilitator mode at this stage of his career. LeBron leads the NBA in assists per game and is the only player in the league averaging a points-assists double-double . Last week: No. 6 Season stats: 38.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.5 steals Harden\u2019s 420 points through the season\u2019s first 11 games ranks third all-time behind a couple of Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s virtuoso performances. Harden is as unstoppable as ever and the Rockets are drafting off his exploitation of defenses. The scary part is Harden is still getting comfortable with his current team. Last week: Not ranked Season stats: 25.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 4.6 assists The last time the Celtics kicked off a season with a 9-1 record was in 2007-08 \u2014 the last time they won the NBA title . Walker\u2019s been outstanding during the Celtics\u2019 9-game win streak and has piled up 3 straight games with at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists. Last week: Not ranked Season stats: 27.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists During his Kia Most Improved Player season in 2018-19, Siakam had five games with 30 or more points. He has five already this season after a 36-point showcase on Wednesday in Portland. He\u2019s powered the Raptors to their 3rd-best start in franchise history while making it clear there is life after Kawhi Leonard. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN was first to report the deal. The 35-year-old forward has been searching for a team ever since he was traded away from the Houston Rockets after playing just 10 games last season. He\u2019s a 10-time All-Star, six-time All-NBA member and former scoring champ with career averages of 24 points, 6.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. Blazers star Damian Lillard was reportedly notified about the deal on Wednesday night, according to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. Lillard is reportedly \u201csupportive\u201d of bringing in Anthony to help the Blazers, who have struggled to start the season with a record of 4-8. According to Wojnarowski, Anthony will join the Blazers on their upcoming road trip, which includes a stop in Houston to face the Rockets on Monday ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). The non-guaranteed deal will reportedly pay Anthony $14,490 for each day he is on the Blazers\u2019 roster, according to Bobby Marks at ESPN. The deal will become fully guaranteed on Jan. 7 if he\u2019s still on the roster. Anthony fills a need for the Blazers, who are short-handed at forward. Zach Collins recently had shoulder surgery that is expected to keep him out for at least four months. Rodney Hood has been bothered by back spasms, but returned for the team\u2019s loss to Toronto. Center Jusuf Nukic remains out after breaking his leg in a game last month and isn\u2019t expected back until after the start of the new year. Pau Gasol was signed by the Blazers in the offseason but is still rehabbing from foot surgery. The Blazers were reportedly interested in Anthony in the summer of 2017. Portland guard CJ McCollum tried to woo him with a photoshopped Instagram post that showed the future Hall of Famer in a Blazers jersey. Anthony is a three-time Olympic gold medalist but struggled at the end of his recent stops in Oklahoma City and Houston following 6 1\/2 seasons in New York. He continued to work out with NBA players, and his many friends and supporters insisted he was still good enough to play in the league. Now he will get a chance to prove it. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time!!\u201d Dwyane Wade wrote on Twitter. Anthony was acquired by the Chicago Bulls from Houston on Jan. 21, with the intention of trading him before the deadline or letting him go. He averaged 13.4 ppg in 10 games with the Rockets last season, but hasn\u2019t played since November 2018. Anthony was traded by Oklahoma City to Atlanta in July 2018, a move that preceded the Hawks releasing him to sign with the Rockets. The Bulls, technically, were his fourth franchise in seven months. Eight of Anthony\u2019s 10 appearances for the Rockets came off the bench after he had started all 1,054 games he\u2019d played in his first 15 NBA seasons. Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":30637,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/social-reaction-carmelo-anthony-signs-portland-trail-blazers","date":"2019-11-15","title":"NBA players react to Carmelo Anthony reportedly signing with Blazers","content":" The NBA world received a surprise on Thursday night when it was reported that Carmelo Anthony was planning to sign with the Portland Trail Blazers.

From its very early beginnings, orange has been a part of Orlando \u2013 from sunshine, to orange groves to Orange County to Orange Ave., it\u2019s the color thread that intertwines the fabric of this city, its people and this team. The uniform keeps the iconic symbol for the Magic over the years featured in orange on the side of the shorts. Once again, the City Edition breaks from the team\u2019s pinstripe tradition for a unique take on the team and its city\u2019s orange roots. The uniform will debut at the Nov. 29 game when the Magic host the Toronto Raptors. https:\/\/twitter.com\/OrlandoMagic\/status\/1195180992568397825 https:\/\/twitter.com\/OrlandoMagic\/status\/1195180992568397825 https:\/\/twitter.com\/OrlandoMagic\/status\/1195180992568397825 This is the fourth and final uniform in the Magic\u2019s collection this season. The team most recently unveiled a modern take on tradition of the throwback to the past with its Statement uniforms, featuring splashes of the team\u2019s classic pinstripes on the shorts and jersey. The other uniforms include Icon and Association. The uniforms were developed through a collaborative effort between the NBA, its players and Nike. The City Edition uniform for each team honors the city and its fans and will change each season. From the person who sits on the floor to the last person in the upper deck, the passion that comes from the fans is unmatched and the history and tradition of each city is truly unique."},{"id":30624,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/paul-george-kawhi-leonard-status-clippers-vs-pelicans","date":"2019-11-14","title":"Paul George to make season debut vs. Pelicans","content":" LA Clippers forward Paul George will make his season debut against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, League Pass ), per coach Doc Rivers. This would also be George\u2019s team debut, playing his first minutes for his hometown team in L.A. The Clippers still won\u2019t be at full strength for Thursday\u2019s contest, however, as Kawhi Leonard (left knee injury management) and Patrick Beverley (sore left calf) are both out. The six-time All-Star George has been sidelined for the Clippers\u2019 first 11 games while recovering from two offseason shoulder surgeries. George underwent rotator cuff surgery in May to repair a partially torn tendon in his right shoulder, and a minor surgery in June to repair a partial tear of his left labrum. The Clippers traded for the perennial All-Star in July with the expectation he\u2019d miss training camp and potentially the start of the season. George had his first full practice with his Clippers teammates on Saturday and had no limitations during that workout. Per the Los Angeles Times , George scrimmaged with a team of reserves against a crew of starters led by Leonard. Leonard, who did not play in the first of the back-to-back sets in each of the past two weeks, finished with 26 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in Wednesday\u2019s 102-93 loss to the Houston Rockets.

When officials eventually ejected the LA Clippers\u2019 coach, Rivers strolled toward the bench smiling. But what\u2019s not a laughing matter in the wake of Houston rolling to its season\u2019s best fifth-straight win Wednesday over the LA Clippers is the upcoming stretch rife with playoff-caliber teams and high-level talent awaiting an injury-depleted Rockets squad working through issues on defense. \u201cThis is when the season gets fun,\u201d said James Harden, who led Houston with 47 points in the 102-93 win . He finished his fifth outing with 40-plus points and five assists or more within the first 11 games of the season, setting an NBA record. \u201cEverything isn\u2019t going to be just smooth, and guys [are] going to be injured. So now we\u2019ve got to step up.\u201d Of Houston\u2019s next 11 opponents, six advanced to the playoffs last season, while the other five (Minnesota, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, and Phoenix) currently rank in the top eight of their respective conferences. Couple the stiff competition with Houston\u2019s shaky roster situation. The Rockets lost Gerald Green to a broken foot before the season even started, and the team announced Tuesday that guard Eric Gordon will be out approximately six weeks after undergoing knee surgery. Attempting to draw a charge the night before in a win at New Orleans, Danuel House Jr. suffered a lower back bruise that forced him out of Wednesday\u2019s win over the Clippers. Then, on a night in which Clint Capela became the first Rocket since Moses Malone to post 20 rebounds for the third consecutive game, the 25-year-old took a vicious blow to the side of the head from JaMychal Green in the fourth quarter that knocked him out of the contest. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said the club\u2019s medical staff will examine Capela, and \u201cthen we\u2019ll know more later.\u201d We\u2019ll soon know more about the title-chasing Rockets during this 12-game stretch, too, which began with a victory over the Clippers that provided a few clues. Most notably, how the Harden and Russell Westbrook dynamic is playing out, especially in crunch time. Westbrook struggled to find his shot most of the night, but with the stakes raised highest, he combined with Harden to score 24 of the Rockets\u2019 28 points in the fourth quarter. Offensively, they\u2019ve proven to be dynamic. Defensively, it\u2019s been questionable. Houston has often mated a top-five offense with a mediocre defense. The Rockets entered Wednesday\u2019s game ranked 20th defensively and third on offense. In fact, it\u2019s somewhat reminiscent of last season, when Houston ranked 25th in defensive efficiency before the All-Star break , only to rev up the tenacity on that end to finish No. 2 in that area after the break. Houston\u2019s former associate head coach Jeff Bzdelik resided over the defensive resurgence last season, beginning in November after team owner Tilman Fertitta coaxed him out of retirement. But when Bzdelik\u2019s contract expired in May, the Rockets opted against bringing him back. Early on this season, it appeared his absence would be an issue yet again. The Rockets struggled defending opponents throughout the season\u2019s first few games and simply looked lost at times, but they\u2019ve turned things around as of late. During the five-game win streak, Houston has performed as the No. 1 defense in the NBA. The performance against the Clippers, who rank second defensively, was a perfect illustration. The 93 points scored by LA represented a Clippers season-low, not to mention an opponent season-low for Houston. In fact, the Rockets have limited opponents to fewer than 100 points in two of their last three outings after failing to accomplish the feat in any of their first eight games. \u201cI think we\u2019re moving in the right direction and that\u2019s all we can worry about,\u201d Westbrook said. With the game tight Wednesday night in the fourth quarter, the Clippers wilted while the Rockets flourished. \u201cIt showed we\u2019re taking a step in that area,\u201d forward P.J. Tucker said. \u201cI think there are some games we\u2019ve lost, especially at the end of the game [by] losing focus, not doing little things. But we came together and really grew. I think we really grew tonight a little bit.\u201d Going back to last season, Houston owns a record of 17-2 when it holds opponents to fewer than 100 points. \u201cIt\u2019s better,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said of the defense. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting a bit more in shape. Tyson [Chandler] and Clint are guarding the basket better. Without Eric [Gordon] \u2026 Eric is one of our better defenders and House is one of our better defenders, but we didn\u2019t have them. So, considering that, it was good. It has to be good because [the Clippers] are good. With Paul George coming back, they\u2019re going to be even better. So, we have to be better.\u201d Houston can expect to see the Clippers again soon, as it faces them on Nov. 22 in the third road game of the upcoming 11-game stretch. The Rockets start with Indiana at home on Friday, before heading to Minnesota the next day and hosting the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday. The Rockets then play back-to-back road games at Denver and the Clippers before coming back to host Dallas, Miami and Atlanta. Houston closes the upcoming stretch with back-to-back road games at San Antonio and Toronto, before finishing at home against the upstart Phoenix Suns. Throughout the stretch, the Rockets plan to take somewhat of a break for Thanksgiving, as it will have a three-day gap between games. Rivers, meanwhile, is already bracing for the dinner-table awkwardness he might experience with his father. \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll go to dinner or anything like that,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe actually is sensitive about stuff like that. So, we\u2019ll see what happens. It was a really good moment though. I\u2019m not going to lie to you, I really did enjoy that.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Hornets forward PJ Washington scored 27 in his NBA debut while setting a rookie record with seven 3-pointers on opening night in Charlotte. Miami\u2019s Kendrick Nunn \u2014 a G League alum \u2014 surprised everyone outside the Heat organization by scoring 24 on opening night , then followed that up with two other games of 25-plus points . Eric Paschall stepped in for the banged-up Warriors with 34 points and 13 rebounds in a surprising win against the Trail Blazers on Nov. 4 (which was also his 23rd birthday ). Ja Morant has several big games on his resume, going toe-to-toe with Kyrie Irving in a win, then hitting an incredible game-winner Wednesday night to stun the Hornets. And now, you can add Chicago guard Coby White to the list. White had fans chanting his name at United Center with a 27-point night that featured an electric fourth quarter for the ages. White erupted for seven 3-pointers down the stretch, setting a Bulls franchise record for 3-pointers in a quarter to spark Chicago\u2019s 120-102 win against New York. \u201dI had been shooting it bad, so it was good to see that first one fall,\u201d said White, who missed his first five shots and entered the fourth quarter with just four points. \u201dThen I just got into a good rhythm.\u201d White led a 24-2 run, hitting 3-pointers on three straight possessions and eventually had fans chanting \u201cCo-by! Co-by!\u201d as the Bulls pulled away. \u201cThe kid is just a super talent,\u201d Knicks coach David Fizdale said afterward. \u201dHe\u2019s got incredible speed, so you have to respect it. Once he gets it going, it\u2019s hard to stop. He just broke the game open.\u201d White has struggled with his shot ( 36.8% overall, 28.6% on 3-pointers ), but moments like this are what makes rookies so fun to watch \u2014 you never know who\u2019s going to break out. * * * Last week: No. 1 Morant made up for a terrible start to the week with one of the most memorable games of his young career. Morant stuggled with his shot in a loss in Orlando ( eight points, 3-for-13 FG ) and a win in San Antonio ( nine points, 2-for-12 FG ) for his only two single-digit scoring games of the season. But playing in front of family and friends in Charlotte, Morant not only got his first career double-double (23 points, 11 assists), but he also notched his first game-winner. He challenged three Hornets in the lane for a ridiculous finish with 0.7 seconds left. It was a moment he\u2019ll likely never forget and helped keep him high on the Ladder after a rough patch. Last week: No. 4 Until Coby White got hot, Barrett was having one of his best games yet. Before that, he was coming off a pair of poor shooting nights against the Cavs  and Mavericks , in which he scored 12 points on 5-for-20 shooting. Against Chicago, Barrett had 21 points, nine assists on an efficient 8-for-16 shooting night . Of course, White\u2019s heroics put a damper on what could have been a boost for Barrett and the struggling Knicks. \u201c This one was tough,\u201d Barrett told reporters. \u201cWhen a guy hits seven 3s in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s kind of tough. But we played three great quarters of basketball and we\u2019ve just got to finish it off in the fourth.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Hachimura fell out of the Top 5 last week after a few subpar games, but the rookie responded to get right back into the mix. Hachimura scored 21 points in both of his games this week, shooting 10-for-13 in a loss to the Cavs (hitting his first seven shots) and 9-for-12 in a loss in Boston. \u201cHe\u2019s even-keeled,\u201d Bradley Beal said of his teammate . \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get too high or too low. I think even an outside person can figure that out about him. He\u2019s very poised for a one-year guy. It\u2019s amazing to see his growth.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Clarke is flying under the radar a bit with Morant grabbing most of the rookie attention and Jaren Jackson Jr. drawing teams\u2019 focus in the frontcourt. But Clarke has become more involved as the season has progressed, averaging 13.3 ppg and 6.7 rpg in three games this week . Overall this season, he\u2019s shooting 60.7% (42.9% on 3-pointers and 91.7% at the line) while leading all rookies in rebounding (6.5 rpg) and ranking second in blocks (1.3 bpg). Last week: No. 5 Nunn has come back down to Earth a bit, but he\u2019s still second among rookies in scoring (16.9 ppg) and tied for first in steals with Matisse Thybulle (1.6 spg). After struggling most of Tuesday night\u2019s game vs. Detroit, the undrafted rookie flipped a switch to finish with 20 points to help Miami win 117-108. His poise drew praise from his coaches and teammates. \u201c I like the fact he was able to stay with it,\u201d coach Erik Spoelstra said . \u201cA lot of that is his makeup. I\u2019m sure the guys were talking to him. We communicate how important him being a threat is to our offense. He\u2019s a talent. He\u2019s a great shooter. He\u2019s also a playmaker. He can do things off the catch or off the dribble, so we need that weapon.\u201d P.J. Washington, Charlotte Hornets: Washington is still seeing big minutes (31.1 mpg, second only to Barrett ) and shooting at a ridiculous clip (49.5% overall, 46.2 on 3-pointers) despite a rough stretch. This week, Washington averaged 8.3 ppg on 34.3% shooting as the Hornets went 0-4. Eric Paschall, Golden State Warriors: Paschall slips out of the Top 5, but he\u2019s still fourth among rookies in scoring, averaging 15.5 points on 52% shooting. Draymond Green\u2019s return hasn\u2019t cut into his minutes, but Paschall went 0-for-7 on 3-pointers in his past three games. Coby White, Chicago Bulls: White has scored in double-digits in his last four games, averaging 16.3 points in that span. His shooting woes are noted above as is his ability to change a game. Cameron Johnson, Phoenix Suns: The No. 11 pick had back-to-back double-digit scoring games this week (15 points in a win vs. Brooklyn , 11 in a loss to the Lakers ). Johnson was 6-for-13 from beyond the arc in those two games and gives the Suns a serious weapon when teams focus on Devin Booker. Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers: The No. 5 pick has been pretty awful early in the season, but the Cavs are sticking with the young guard. Garland put up 15 points and six assists in a Friday win against the Wizards. Two days later, he had 12 points and six assists in a win in New York. He\u2019s shooting 32.7% overall this season (and 25% on 3-pointers), but those games are at least a glimmer of hope. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 13 ) Send any questions or comments to my email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

For one game, Knicks fans will get an in-person reminder of the unique talent their team traded away to sign players that signed somewhere else. Porzingis is 7-foot-3 and 24 years old, but he has the shot profile of a small guard like Kemba Walker or a 38-year-old wing like Kyle Korver \u2014 guys that don\u2019t get into the paint very much. This trend has increased for Porzingis during his first nine games with the Mavericks as he works back from a 20-month absence. Porzingis is coming off one of the worst shooting nights of his career, a 1-for-11 performance in Boston on Monday. In the loss, all 11 of Porzingis\u2019 shots came from outside the restricted area and nine of the 11 came from outside the paint. (Give credit to the Boston defense, which has allowed its opponents to take only 47% of their shots in the paint. That\u2019s the league\u2019s sixth lowest opponent rate.)  This game is not an outlier for Porzingis. This season, he has taken only 35% of his shots from in the paint, the 19th-lowest rate among 105 players with at least 100 field goal attempts through Wednesday \u2014 lower than those of Chris Paul (38%) and Trae Young (42%). Porzingis has never been much of an interior presence. During his first four seasons, he has never taken more than 41% of his shots from the paint. He\u2019s a \u201cunicorn\u201d because, at his size, he can comfortably shoot from 30 feet. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Porzingis leads the Mavs with 31 post-ups . But he has shot just 6-for-19, with one assist and not a single foul drawn on those post-ups. He\u2019s been much more efficient as a \u201croll man,\u201d according to Synergy tracking, but roll man possessions include pick-and-pops, and Porzingis rolled into the paint on only a few of his 31 roll-man possessions. In some cases, he has attacked a close-out after popping to the perimeter, but those attacks haven\u2019t been very successful. He\u2019s 5-for-22 on drives this season . But over Porzingis\u2019 career, his shots in the paint (1.01 points per attempt) have been worth more than his shots from outside the paint (0.95). That latter number will climb, because he\u2019s traded some of the mid-range shots he took in New York for more valuable shots from beyond the 3-point arc. But the most valuable shots on the floor (worth about 1.25 points per attempt league-wide) are those in the restricted area, where Porzingis has seen a big reduction in shots since he was a rookie. In his rookie year, 24% of Porzingis\u2019 shots came from the restricted area. That was well below the league average (32%), and since then, the percentage of his shots that have come from the restricted area has dropped every season. This season, it\u2019s down to just 12%. It\u2019s early in the season, Porzingis is working his way back from a devastating injury and the Mavs still have the league\u2019s second-ranked offense (112.9 points scored per 100 possessions). On the other end of the floor, Porzingis puts his size to good use. As he did before he tore his ACL two seasons ago, he ranks as one of the league\u2019s best rim protectors , with opponents having just shot 46% at the basket when he\u2019s been there. But imagine if he was nearly the interior presence on offense as he is on defense. Imagine if Porzingis could combine his pick-and-pop game with some stronger post-ups, a few rolls to the rim and some time spent in the dunker spot (below the block) as Luka Doncic attacks the paint. Then we might see the true potential of this unicorn. *** John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Porzingis returns to New York: It was more than 640 days ago that then-Knicks All-Star Kristaps Porzingis last played at Madison Square Garden . He was since dealt to the Dallas Mavericks, who are in New York for his return game tonight ( 8 ET, TNT ). The stats show he\u2019s still up to his \u201cunicorn\u201d ways and knows cheers (or boos) cascading from Knicks fans at MSG tonight are not outside the realm of reality. This game will close out the teams\u2019 season series after New York won in Dallas, 106-102, on Nov. 8 . 2. George back tonight (right?): Per the Clippers\u2019 injury report, Paul George is listed as probable tonight against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, League Pass ). If he does suit up, it would mark his first game with L.A. Should that happen, George will probably be feeling a little lonely tonight as both star forward Kawhi Leonard (left knee injury management) and defensive-minded guard Patrick Beverley (sore left calf) will both be out against the Pelicans. 3. Scorers collide in desert:  Among East players, no one is averaging more points per game against West foes this season than the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young (34 ppg). On the flip side of that equation, the Phoenix Suns\u2019 Devin Booker is 4th among West players (29.7 ppg) when facing East opponents. As Atlanta visits Phoenix ( 9 ET, League Pass ), there\u2019s the added bonus of Young going for his fourth straight game with 30 or more points and 10 or more assists. Scoring records might fall in this one! 4. A battle of who\u2019s more clutch:  For the uninitiated, clutch games are defined by the NBA as a game within five points with less than five minutes less. Both the Denver Nuggets and Brooklyn Nets have played in eight such games (Brooklyn is 4-4; Denver is 6-2) this season. As these teams meet this evening ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) in Denver, the Nets may be without Caris LeVert but remain potent. Six of Brooklyn\u2019s 10 games this season have been within three points or less in the final minute. Lastly, Nets guard Kyrie Irving is listed as probable with a right shoulder impingement. 5. Remember when Jennings scored 55?: Ten years can go by fast. We\u2019re at that point now with Brandon Jennings, who as a rookie lit up the Golden State Warriors (and future two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry!) for 55 points in 2009. Jennings\u2019 career never really could live up to the hype of that kind of moment, but nine seasons, four playoff appearances and a seminal franchise moment are nothing to sneeze at."},{"id":30603,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-steve-aschburner","date":"2019-11-14","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Breaking down Giannis Antetokounmpo, surprise teams + more","content":"Sekou Smith is joined by NBA.com senior writer Steve Aschburner to talk about Giannis Antetokounmpo, surprise teams from the midwest, the state of the New York Knicks and much more. * * * Subscribe to the Hang Time Podcast on Apple Podcasts or Spotify for new episodes throughout the season!"},{"id":30621,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/russell-westbrook-patrick-beverley-reignite-feud-postgame-comments","date":"2019-11-14","title":"Russell Westbrook, Patrick Beverley reignite long-running feud","content":" Patrick Beverley and Russell Westbrook have history . This we know. The continuation, this we should expect. Wednesday night, the Rockets won the battle \u2014 a chippy 102-93 contest in which James Harden scored 47 points \u2014 and Westbrook re-ignited the war. During his postgame media scrum, asked about Beverley\u2019s defense, Westbrook said: \u201cWhat\u2019d James score? 44? 47? Pat Bev trick y\u2019all, man, like he playing defense. He don\u2019t guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing.\u201d Westbrook commended Beverley for playing hard, that he sometimes does a good job, but tonight \u201cJames took advantage of him and got what he wanted.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon reported that Beverley wasn\u2019t interested in responding, saying \u201cDon\u2019t start that, don\u2019t start that. I don\u2019t care about that.\u201d Yet MacMahon followed up to discover that, per ESPN Stats & Info, Harden was 0-of-6 with four turnovers when defended by Beverley. Houston was up two with about two minutes left when Beverley, a former Rocket, fouled out. Harden made both free throws before grabbing a rebound on the other end and hitting a 3 to make it 95-88. Beverley was given a technical foul during a timeout after the play and Harden hit the two free throws. When Beverley got his sixth foul, Westbrook celebrated with a mocking wave, although the two did not exchange words. After the game, Beverley told reporters he was upset about his sixth foul \u2014 which came when he bumped chests with Harden away from the ball \u2014 as well as the technical foul he got. \u201cI got a technical foul because I looked at the ref, I guess, too long, and I guess you can\u2019t look at people in this league now,\u201d Beverley said after the game . \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fair. As a unit, we work too hard \u2014 coaches work too hard, players work too hard, staff work too hard \u2014 to prepare for each game, and to let a game come down to referees and free throws I don\u2019t think is fair.

Rivers had previously called a timeout with the intention of using his coach\u2019s challenge, but did so after the 30-second window had closed. At that point, he was informed the challenge couldn\u2019t take place, but the timeout would be restored. Soon after, James Harden nailed a stepback 3-pointer with 1:31 remaining, giving Houston a 95-88 lead, and Patrick Beverley picked up a technical foul following an interaction with Tony Brothers. With play stopped and Harden taking the resultant free throw, the referees and Doc Rivers began discussing the Clippers\u2019 remaining number of timeouts. Play nearly resumed before the conversation between Rivers and Brothers escalated, at which point Austin Rivers could be seen just behind Brothers gleefully forming the ubiquitous \u2018T\u2019 signal as if imploring the refs to call a technical foul. It was whistled in short fashion, Austin began waving goodbye, a second tech followed and Austin made a \u2018call me\u2019 gesture toward Doc as his father exited the court. Harden then made the two free throws that resulted in Doc Rivers\u2019 ejection to push the margin to 98-88. Doc Rivers said after the game that he was upset with the officials because of a mix up with the number of timeouts. He said that he tried to challenge a play but that it was past the 30 seconds allotted after a play in which to make a challenge. So they told him he didn\u2019t burn a timeout on the challenge and he had two remaining. His ejection came after they said he was out of timeouts when he called the timeout where Beverley received his technical. \u201cI\u2019m fine with [not having the timeout] if they had told me,\u201d Doc Rivers said. \u201cBut the officials can\u2019t tell me I have my timeout back, and then have me use it and tell me after the fact you don\u2019t have it. To tell me after the fact, that was big! \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to win with the way we were playing right now offensively or defensively but mistakes like that cannot happen on this level. That was awful and the response was to throw me out? I didn\u2019t swear. I just said: \u2018This is nuts.\u2019 \u201d The pool reporter\u2019s interview with Brothers confirmed that Doc Rivers was \u201cincorrectly informed [the Clippers] would retain their timeout\u201d following the uninitiated challenge. Brothers then approached Rivers to correct the number upon a timeout being called following the Harden 3, and Rivers took exception. Brothers claimed Rivers \u201cwas given an opportunity to gain his composure\u201d but came out on the floor, resulting in the first tech. After telling Brothers \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and staying on the floor, the ejecting technical was issued. https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBAOfficial\/status\/1194844580228800515 In his on-court interview after the game, Austin Rivers said: \u201cGet him out of here, man. Got to get him out of here. I don\u2019t know \u2026 that made my night, though, I\u2019m not gonna lie. We got the win. My dad got thrown out. It was a good night.\u201d After the game, Austin Rivers told reporters he \u201cknew it was coming\u201d once he saw Doc Rivers started blinking rapidly during the argument. \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll go to dinner or anything like that. He actually is sensitive to stuff like that, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But I love him. It was a really good moment though. I enjoyed it a lot, I\u2019m not going to lie to you.

LA Clippers forward Paul George plans to make his season (and franchise) debut this week, most likely on Thursday against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, League Pass ), per multiple reports. ESPN\u2019s Ohm Youngmisuk and the Los Angeles Times \u2018 Andrew Grief report George seems to be leaning toward a Thursday debut. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes was the first to report that George is planning to make his season debut on Thursday . The six-time All-Star has been sidelined for the Clippers\u2019 first 10 games while recovering from two offseason shoulder surgeries. George underwent rotator cuff surgery in May to repair a partially torn tendon in his right shoulder, and a minor surgery in June to repair a partial tear of his left labrum. The Clippers traded for the perennial All-Star in July with the expectation he\u2019d miss training camp and potentially the start of the season. George had his first full practice with his Clippers teammates on Saturday and had no limitations during that workout. Per the Los Angeles Times , George scrimmaged with a team of reserves against a crew of starters led by Kawhi Leonard. \u201cFrom a health standpoint, I feel great,\u201d George said, per the newspaper. \u201cBut I think just rhythm, especially where these guys are at right now in their season, they\u2019re flowing right now. So I just want to come in with an easy transition. \u201cI\u2019m gonna play hard, make mistakes. It\u2019s part of the game, but I plan on learning from that point on to where late in the season, I\u2019m where I want to be.\u201d Last season, George averaged career highs of 28 points, 8.2 rebounds, 4.1 assists and a league-leading 2.2 steals. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a big piece,\u201d Kawhi Leonard said . \u201cHe\u2019ll take a lot of attention. Then we\u2019ll have to figure it out again.\u201d \u201cImagine having Kawhi and Lou (Williams) and Paul,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, \u201cand a team tries to trap you. You\u2019re going to pretty much get what you want.\u201d While George may soon be back in the mix, guard Landry Shamet had an MRI on his left ankle on Tuesday. Per multiple reports, he was diagnosed with a grade 2 high ankle sprain and a timeline for his return is yet to be determined. He did play on Wednesday against Houston . Leonard, who did not play in the first of the back-to-back sets in each of the past two weeks, also played in Wednesday\u2019s game."},{"id":30604,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/davis-status-warriors-game-uncertain","date":"2019-11-14","title":"Anthony Davis out against Warriors","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Anthony Davis is resting his sore right shoulder for the Los Angeles Lakers in their game against Golden State.

Obviously frustrated. It sucks watching and not being able to go out there and play, especially with the start that we\u2019ve had.\u201d Hayward broke his hand when he collided with LaMarcus Aldridge in Saturday night\u2019s game against the San Antonio Spurs. The Boston forward had surgery Monday. \u201cYou always think about the worst-case scenario, and certainly on the play I didn\u2019t know exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I heard it, and felt it and knew something immediately was wrong.\u201d Hayward missed all but five minutes of the 2017-18 season after breaking his leg in the first quarter of the opener. The gruesome injury left his teammates looking away in horror, and Hayward took a year or so before he was even willing to watch it on videotape. But this one he watched right away \u2014 if only to see what went wrong. \u201cWhen you watch it in slow motion, it\u2019s like \u2018What happened?\u2019 Like, I don\u2019t think anything even should have happened. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s that bad at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a random play. Sometimes that\u2019s basketball.\u201d Hayward, 29, returned last season and played in 72 games, most of them off the bench, and averaged 11.5 points and 4.5 rebounds \u2014 far short of his numbers before the injury. He had been closer to his peak performance in the first seven games this season, averaging 19 points, four assists and a career-high seven rebounds before the latest injury. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s frustrating. There\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cFelt like we were building some good momentum as a team, as well as me individually. So the timing of it, definitely frustrating. All things considered, I think it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Another difference between his last injury and this one is that Hayward will be able to run and maintain his conditioning while he waits for his hand to heal. Last time, he was forced to shoot baskets from a chair, and practice picking things up with his toes to regain his dexterity. Hayward said the doctors put a pin and a plate in his hand, which will make it stronger and help him heal faster. He isn\u2019t sure on his timetable to begin shooting again. He is allowed to take the splint off to exercise, but there\u2019s a bigger problem: His daughters helped decorate it, and they used the colors of the rival Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cSome of my favorite things: Puppies, unicorns, rainbows,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cI tried to get them to not use purple and go with some green, but they were pretty adamant about some of the colors they picked. I guess an artist is going to be an artist.\u201d"},{"id":30710,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kristaps-porzingis-readies-return-new-york","date":"2019-11-13","title":"Kristaps Porzingis ready for return to Madison Square Garden","content":" NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Kristaps Porzingis crashed to the Madison Square Garden floor in pain on Feb. 6, 2018 , it was soon clear that would be his final play of the season. Much harder to imagine was that it would be the final play of his Knicks\u2019 career. Porzingis returns to the arena on Thursday for a nationally televised game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Knicks ( 8 ET, TNT ), who are already showing signs of the type of chaos that helped sour the star forward on the team in the first place. Though Porzingis enjoyed the city and the fans, the dark cloud under which the Knicks permanently reside was something he\u2019s been glad to escape. \u201cI remember when I was there the expectations were always high for us, and it\u2019s a city hungry for success in basketball,\u201d Porzingis said Wednesday. \u201cAnd for them, for the fans and for the city to be going through this year after year, it\u2019s got to be tough. And so it\u2019s always a lot of pressure and when things are not going right immediately, there needs to be changes, and this year is no different for them again.\u201d The Knicks are losing big, losing often and it took all of 10 games for speculation about a coaching change to begin. Just two days after beating Porzingis and the Mavericks in Dallas, the Knicks were blown out at home by Cleveland on Sunday. Afterward, Knicks President Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry held a news conference to express their disappointment, unusual for any NBA team after a game in which there was no injury or trade news, but especially for one whose executives so infrequently speak to the media. That seemed to add more pressure on second-year coach David Fizdale, whose team is 2-9 after having the NBA\u2019s worst record last season. Porzingis was once viewed as the player who would lead the Knicks through the turbulence. The 7-foot-3 forward was in the midst of his first All-Star season when he tore his left ACL after dunking against Milwaukee. He was rehabilitating the injury last season and the Knicks said he was set for more tests in February, about a year after the injury. He was in Dallas by then. Porzingis was surprisingly traded on Jan. 31 after Knicks management said he told them during a meeting that day that he wanted out. He was sent to the Mavericks in a deal that for now looks worse all the time for New York. \u201cIts in the past now and I don\u2019t want to bring it back up,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cIt is what it is. It happened and now I\u2019m in a new place and looking forward to what\u2019s ahead of me.\u201d The native of Latvia was booed on draft night in Brooklyn by Knicks fans not interested in an unfamiliar European player, but he quickly became a favorite once they saw him play. He isn\u2019t sure what the reception will be Thursday. \u201cKP\u2019s KP. He was an All-Star when he was here, played his tail off when he was with the Knicks,\u201d said Tim Hardaway Jr., who was also part of the trade to Dallas. \u201cThey\u2019re fans at the end of the day, so they\u2019re going to give their emotions and express their emotions however they want.\u201d By including Hardaway and Courtney Lee in the deal, the Knicks freed up enough salary cap space to land two superstars last summer. Instead they got none, while Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving signed in Brooklyn along with DeAndre Jordan \u2014 who had come to the Knicks in the trade. New York also got Dennis Smith Jr., but his first full season with the Knicks is off to a rough start. He struggled after hurting his back in preseason, then sat out seven games following the death of a family member before returning Tuesday in a loss in Chicago. The Knicks were outscored by 22 points in his 14 minutes and he fell to 1-for-14 for the season, with three points. The Knicks are still owed two first-round picks from the Mavs, players who may come to the same organizational turmoil that Porzingis faced. He had four coaches in less than four full seasons, a far cry from the stability he has now in Dallas, where Rick Carlisle is in his 12th season. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a positive here that there\u2019s a coach that\u2019s been here already for many, many years and won here and is well-respected here,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough as a player, of course, but its not something I can affect really. So it happened that way in New York and everything is a learning experience, a learning lesson for me.\u201d"},{"id":30685,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-nets-sign-iman-shumpert","date":"2019-11-13","title":"Nets sign veteran guard Iman Shumpert","content":" The Brooklyn Nets have signed veteran guard Iman Shumpert to a contract .

George\u2019s debut! (Or maybe not just yet): Will Paul George suit up? That\u2019s the question on the minds of LA Clippers fans as a showdown with the Houston Rockets looms ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ). George is listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d against the Rockets and per the latest reports, it seems more likely he\u2019ll play Thursday against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, League Pass ). Either way, this is one story to keep an eye on as game time nears. 2. Thomas back in Boston as a starter: Back in the 2016-17 season, Isaiah Thomas was an All-Star and legit Kia MVP candidate for the Celtics. Since then, he\u2019s been traded twice and played for four different teams, including his present one \u2014 the Washington Wizards. Thomas seems to be regaining some of his old ways and is a starter again as his return to Boston looms ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). Snagging a win \u2014 and ending the Celtics\u2019 eight-game win streak \u2014 against the team that traded him to Cleveland in 2017 would no doubt be sweet for Thomas. 3. They know what it\u2019s like \u2026: Golden State plays host to the Los Angeles Lakers ( 10 ET, ESPN ), who are unsure of star big man Anthony Davis\u2019 status after he took \u201ca shot\u201d to the ribs Tuesday night. The latest word is he\u2019s unlikely to play. But if anyone understands the trials of being without superstars this season, it is the Warriors. They just got Draymond Green back in the lineup, but their patchwork crew must stay competitive with a Lakers team that ranks in the top three this month in second-half Defensive Rating . 4. Wiggins starting to heat up:  The Timberwolves and Spurs each find themselves in a surprising space so far this season, namely that Minnesota is still in the West chase and San Antonio is off to a slower-than-usual start. As Minnesota readies for San Antonio ( 8 ET, League Pass ), it can look to the recent sizzling play from Andrew Wiggins. He\u2019s averaging 30.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, 4 assists and 1.6 blocks per game over his last five games as the Wolves have won two of their last three. 5. A look back at Mourning\u2019s journey: Back on this date in 1992, Alonzo Mourning made his NBA debut with the Charlotte Hornets. His performance (12 points, three rebounds, one block) were hardly indicative of the career the future seven-time All-Star, two-time Defensive Player of the Year and Hall of Famer would amass. Still, everyone starts somewhere and today, we remember that moment with a look back at Mourning\u2019s stellar (if often overlooked) career."},{"id":30683,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-victor-oladipo-g-league-practice","date":"2019-11-13","title":"Victor Oladipo practices with Pacers' G League affiliate","content":" Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo practiced with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants on Tuesday, the franchise\u2019s G League affiliate, Pacers coach Nate McMillan told media members before Tuesday\u2019s game against Oklahoma City.

But he won\u2019t be the last of his generation to be honored that way. Parker\u2019s big night in San Antonio generated some interesting conversation about who, among current NBA players only, would be in line for similar honors someday. Keep in mind that the standards for a retired jersey with one franchise differs from one to another. Winning titles in Los Angeles or Boston \u2014 or even Chicago or Golden State \u2014 is a tougher sell than it is where there aren\u2019t already multiple championship banners. Accomplishments matter \u2026 and so does sentiment, too. There are always unique variables at work when it comes to retiring jerseys, which is a much more significant honor than inducting a player into a franchise\u2019s ring of honor. With Parker\u2019s star-studded ceremony still fresh in our minds, here\u2019s a list of other stars who will one day be able to see their jerseys up in the rafters: * * * LeBron James (Cavs and Heat): If there is anyone that\u2019s an absolute lock to see his jersey raised high when he calls it a career, it\u2019s LeBron. He delivered Cleveland a title, ending the city\u2019s 52-year title drought, in his second stint with what is essentially his hometown team. Before that, he was the catalyst for the Heat\u2019s four straight Finals trips (2011-14) and back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013. The standard to join the Lakers\u2019 retired-jersey fraternity is tougher, of course. The greatest Lakers get statues \u2014 a fate that might await LeBron in Cleveland one day. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala (Warriors): Also known as the \u201cHamptons 5\u201d , they will all be immortalized someday by Golden State. All five played a role in the championship fun and excitement they generated during the franchise\u2019s golden era of the past half-decade. You can make a case for all five of them to enjoy jersey retirement ceremonies on their own. That, however, would go against everything their \u201cStrength In Numbers\u201d era was about. Rest assured, though, that all five of them will have their day. James Harden (Rockets): Harden started his career as a super sixth man in Oklahoma City before rewriting his legacy after a trade to Houston. He\u2019s already one of the most prolific and creative scorers the league has seen. The Rockets have had their fair share of legendary players and know what it\u2019s like to bask in the championship glow provided by the rise of a transcendent player. Harden\u2019s jersey will be in good company some day, perhaps right next to Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s No. 34. Russell Westbrook (Thunder): In an era where nearly every other elite superstar of his generation made a move via trade or free agency, Westbrook stuck to his roots in Oklahoma City until he had no choice but to move on. He endeared himself to generations of OKC fans by playing at a fever pitch from start to finish, earning All-Star, All-NBA and Kia MVP honors there. Being a part of a Finals team with Durant and Harden helped cement his legacy. Although he\u2019s now in Houston, he\u2019ll always have a place in the hearts of Thunder fans. Damian Lillard (Blazers): Lillard personifies the values of a basketball-mad fan base in a city that adores its team and stars in a unique way. The Blazers did their homework on the unheralded point guard from Weber State and have enjoyed everything that\u2019s happened since. From his Kia Rookie of the Year campaign in 2013 to today, he has played out better than anyone could have imagined. Lillard, one of the most underappreciated stars of his generation, couldn\u2019t have found a better match in a city and franchise. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Bucks): The rise of the \u201cThe Greak Freak\u201d from obscure prospect to Kia MVP in just six seasons gives his story extra dramatic flair. His relentless work ethic helped change the culture in Milwaukee and branded him as a potential successor to James as the face of the league. The fact that he authored the greatest individual season in Bucks history since Kareem-Abdul Jabbar\u2019s days has carved out a permanent space for Antetokounmpo\u2019s jersey in franchise lore. Kemba Walker (Hornets): The face of the franchise in Charlotte for the first eight years of his career, Walker has since moved on to Boston. But he remains the Hornets\u2019 career leader in several categories and was a beloved fan favorite for a team that never achieved any sustained postseason success. Few players of his or any era forged a connection to a city and franchise as Walker did with Charlotte. Derrick Rose (Bulls): Born and raised in Chicago, Rose (at 22) became the youngest player to win the Kia MVP in 2011. He also joined Michael Jordan and Elton Brand as the only Bulls to win Rookie of the Year honors. Even though knee injuries derailed his career in his hometown, he piled up enough early career accolades to one day be honored with a retired jersey. Although he never led the franchise back to championship prominence, he is the the most decorated Bull since MJ. Vince Carter (Raptors): How many players can say they served as the basketball inspiration for an entire nation? Carter can. His time with the Raptors served as the spark for generations of future NBA players, many of whom have gotten the chance to play with their childhood idol in the twilight of his future Hall of Fame career. His five seasons with the New Jersey Nets solidified his status as one of the best players of his generation. But his star was never brighter than it was from 1998-2004 when \u201cVinsanity\u201d inspired Canada. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley (Grizzlies): These two should grit and grind their way to the rafters in Memphis, on the same night if possible. They helped usher in the greatest run in franchise history, spearheading a feisty and physical style that spoke to the city\u2019s blue-collar ways. The \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d Grizzlies validated their rise to prominence with a West finals run in 2013 steered by Gasol and Conley. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan (Raptors): Lowry and his best buddy DeRozan were separated before they could realize their dreams of winning a title together in Toronto. Lowry realized it last season alongside Kawhi Leonard, thus cementing his legacy as an all-time great Raptor. He\u2019ll always have a place to call home north of the border because of the franchise-altering success that took place on his watch. DeRozan was a fan favorite who wanted to finish his career in Toronto. He, too, will always have a home in the city. Blake Griffin and Chris Paul (Clippers): The LA end for these two was messier than it should have been, especially since they oversaw the \u201cLob City\u201d era that revitalized the franchise. Time will surely heal all wounds, somewhere down the road. History will be kinder to the Clippers\u2019 climb out of the doldrums than anyone was during their injury-tortured run. Griffin and Paul are locks for the Hall of Fame one day. Plus, a franchise without much history to celebrate could use a couple of jerseys to jazz up their new building. Kawhi Leonard (Raptors): Is a one-year surreal playoff run enough to warrant franchise immortality? Clippers fans are hoping Kawhi and Paul George give them a reason to raise their jerseys to the rafters someday, too. Right now, Leonard is a seeming lock for the honor with the Raptors, where his brief-but-fruitful stay there gave their rabid fan base their first NBA championship. Dwight Howard (Magic): After his first eight seasons in Orlando, Howard had a near slam-dunk case for the Hall of Fame and retired jersey status. Yes, his exit from Orlando was messy. And he has yet to find a way to part ways with any of the other franchises on good terms. Still, you can\u2019t overlook his Magic-era feats: All-Star berths, three Kia Defensive Player of the Year awards, five All-NBA first team nods and a Finals trip in 2009. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Dallas wunderkind Luka Doncic and budding Toronto star Pascal Siakam weren\u2019t featured prominently enough (Doncic) or at all (Siakam) on that edition, an administrative oversight that will be rectified this week. We heard you loud and clear as my inbox was on overload and the social media feed was equally robust, though not nearly as family-friendly. Doncic has the Mavericks looking like a playoff contender in the West, leading them in points (28.3), rebounds (10.3), assists (9.1) and steals (1.1). He\u2019s already gone toe-to-toe with LeBron James and looked every bit the future superstar many he thought he\u2019d be after his Kia Rookie of the Year season. Meanwhile, Siakam is continuing the breakout performance he put on in The Finals, his skill-level finally on par with next-level energy and effort. At 26.3 ppg, 9.5 rpg and 3.9 apg , he\u2019s doing his best to fill the franchise anchor-sized void left by Kawhi Leonard\u2019s exit. More importantly, both Doncic and Siakam have their teams looking solid to open this season (the Mavericks are 6-4 and the Raptors 7-3). With the heavy emphasis winning has on the MVP chase every season, there\u2019s no way either of these young stars should be in the background of the conversation. A word on Jokic: This is for the why-isn\u2019t-he-higher-on-the-list crowd \u2026 He sank back-to-back game-winners and the Denver Nuggets are 7-2. Sure, he\u2019s had a bit of a bumpy start to his season. But showing up when your team needs you at crunch time matters. The Nuggets have won four straight games with a visit from Atlanta up next . Harden and Russ catch a vibe: How\u2019s that experiment going in Houston? Just fine, it appears, with Harden leading the league in scoring (37.1) and is sixth in assists (8.2) while Westbrook is at 21.9 ppg, 8.7 rpg and 7.4 apg. Houston has some defensive issues to address, but they\u2019ve won three straight heading into Wednesday\u2019s showdown with the LA Clippers . Now, let\u2019s get into your comments about last week\u2019s Kia MVP Ladder \u2026 * * * From:  Jeff Hagen Nov. 9, 2019 | 8:07 a.m. I\u2019m not even a Dallas fan but the guy nearly averaging a trippy double should probably be in your top 10\u2026 https:\/\/twitter.com\/jon_swavyy\/status\/1192863716938792962?s From:  Igor Jagu\u0161i\u0107 Nov. 9, 2019 | 1:18 p.m. Don\u2019t sleep on Luka \u2026 Step up your game or else you\u2019ll end up on my \u201cLuka Doncic doubters\u201d montage when he wins his first MVP, just like Stephen A. Smith. * * * My response:  The Luka hype is warranted, Igor. He entered Monday night\u2019s game against Boston third in the league in combined points, rebounds and assists, trailing only Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo (the last two Kia MVPs). Hey, I wear glasses. It took me a little longer to see it, but Doncic certainly belongs among the elite list early on this season. * * * My response:  The Siakam omission is more egregious than Doncic being outside of the top 10. Siakam has given Raptors fans a reason to believe that they\u2019ll be a factor this season and for years to come. He\u2019s another huge win for the Raptors\u2019 player-development department, which has to rank among the best in the league. From:  Dewayne Fowler Nov. 10, 2019 | 10:18 p.m Hi Sekou, Just wanted to share my thoughts on the MVP race with you. I think ultimately the most important factor in the process is Top Player on Top Team. I think it is important, though, to include both sides of the ball. When a team is better offensively or defensively when a certain player plays as opposed to when they sit, I think that should be a major factor. The Clippers are among the stingiest defense in the league with or without Kawhi, so for him, I think his MVP claim would come from them being a top offensive team \u2014 same with LeBron and AD. But for someone like Jokic on a top-tier offensive team, I think where they ultimately end up defensively should determine his MVP candidacy. With that being said I think Giannis is the MVP right now. I don\u2019t doubt that whatever team he played for would instantly become a contender. He has the most impact on both sides of the ball. As for now my top 5 is Giannis, Lebron, Kawhi, Jokic, Embiid. . * * * My response:  As you know, Dewayne, I\u2019m a staunch supporter of the best player\/best team theory to MVP voting. And every player in the mix is working within a context unique unto himself, so there will always be variables. The availability of said player, however, is the most important thing. You\u2019ve got to be in uniform to have a chance to chase everything else. From: JD Klein Nov. 9, 2019 | 9:12 p.m. What does Lou Williams need to do to get some respect? He\u2019s helped the Clippers far more than Lillard has helped the Blazers. Heck, Montrezl Harrel is more MVP so far than Lillard. In fact, Lou just hit the game-sealing 3-pointer against Lillard a couple nights ago, while Lillard had 0 in the 4th quarter. Forget familiar names \u2014 Williams for sure, and possibly Harrell \u2014 is\/are as valuable as any player in the league right now. Heck, what has Harden done that\u2019s so valuable? Respect for LouWill! And don\u2019t sleep on Trez ( both had 34 points each as the Kawhi-less Clips almost beat Milwaukee). * * * My response:  I hear you JD, but there\u2019s an award for what the Clippers\u2019 outstanding reserves do. In fact, it\u2019s practically named after Williams \u2026 and it\u2019s not the Kia MVP. From: Eboni Gordon Nov. 8, 2019 | 12:43 p.m. Sekou, I liked your post about the MVP ladder until you stated that Kawhi is the best player in the league. You made a statement, \u201cIs this even a question?\u201d Well, it definitely is and many people do not agree \u2026 including myself. Please keep that in mind before trying to push a narrative about someone who can\u2019t even play a full season. * * * My response:  Wait a minute, Eboni. Did I miss something since The Finals? I thought the debate ended then. Kawhi already settled it for me. * * * From: Constantine Chatzilouis Nov. 9, 2019 | 7 a.m. Do you really believe that Leonard alone stopped Giannis in the conference finals? Or was that a combination of 3-4 players against Giannis with Leonard in the top? Thanking you in advance for your answer \u2026 * * * My response:  I never said he did anything alone, Costas. But let\u2019s be real about this: do you really think the Raptors win that title last season without Kawhi dominating on both ends? I hate answering questions with another question, but this seems like it should be plain to see. From: Sanjay Saravanan Nov. 10, 2019 | 2:19 a.m. I think Bradley Beal should be at least in the just missed the cut section. He is averaging 26.1 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 6.5 apg \u2026 those are MVP top 10 numbers. He is on a subpar Wizards team, but he individually is playing great. The award is for most valuable player, that means if a team loses him to injury, it\u2019s is the team that will be impacted the most. It\u2019s not greatest or highest numbers or the best triple-double guy. The only fair MVPs in the last few years are Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If the Wizards lost Beal, they would crumble. He is also a great community leader and a fan favorite in D.C. There should be a couple more awards like the scoring award, the team player, the MVP, and the Best Stats player. Hope you consider my opinion and my homie Beal. * * * My response:  Consider it considered, Sanjay. But I cannot promise you will see Beal\u2019s name on the list anytime soon. Great player. All-Star. But MVP candidate \u2026 that\u2019s a tough one.  From:  Landon Bangerter Nov. 9, 2019 | 11:38 a.m. I love your MVP ladders Sekou, as always. It\u2019s inspired me to create one of my own that I think is worth a look. I think your top 4 is spot on, and then we start to disagree. I do not think Embiid, Lillard, or Irving are quite deserving to be in this race yet, given suspensions and their team\u2019s low spot in the standings. I also think Doncic and Kemba Walker should be much higher. In any case, here\u2019s my ladder: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) 2. LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) 3. Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers) 4. Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers) 5. James Harden (Houston Rockets) 6. Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b7. K emba Walker (Boston Celtics) 8. Montrezl Harrell (LA Clippers) 9. Gordon Hayward (Boston Celtics) 10. Donovan Mitchell (Utah Jazz) My honorable mentions:  B am Adebayo, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, Jayson Tatum, Lou Williams * * * My response:  There\u2019s nothing like making your own list. And I agree Kemba\u2019s impact on the Celtics isn\u2019t being appreciated. But as I mentioned earlier Landon, this is the MVP conversation \u2014 not the Kia Sixth Man list. From: Yisroel Majeski (in Israel) Nov. 11, 2019 | 10:28 a.m. Why don\u2019t you have Westbrook in your top 10? He\u2019s probably gonna end up averaging another triple-double. He\u2019s been massively efficient so far this year and he\u2019s still adjusting to his new team. I wouldn\u2019t sleep on Brodie. * * * My response:  Greetings to you, Yisroel, and to all the NBA fans in your part of the basketball universe. Russ has been really good in Houston, better even than I thought he might be early on. And I was all-in on the move this summer. But it\u2019s hard to shine appropriately with Harden on your team. It\u2019s a long season, though. We\u2019ll keep Westbrook in mind as the season evolves. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

That was evident early, when the visiting team stared down a familiar face and played up to the competition ever so scrappily. This was a we\u2019ll-show-you game, with the Toronto Raptors demonstrating to Kawhi Leonard that they\u2019re the defending champs and he is, with all due respect, no longer part of that equation. And so, although it was ultimately a triumphant night for Leonard because, after all, the LA Clippers managed the 98-88 victory , the Clippers did so in spite of him for the most part. What a coincidence that Leonard\u2019s first less-than-stellar game with his new team came against his old. But the beauty of this, from the Clippers\u2019 standpoint, is Leonard won\u2019t be a solo star for much longer. He won\u2019t see as many double-teams, as he did constantly against the Raptors. If his shot doesn\u2019t fall, and it went clankety-clank Monday at Staples Center, he will be bailed out. And the turnovers \u2014 he had nine, more than triple the number of baskets he scored \u2014 will undoubtedly be reduced because someone is coming to rescue him from regular ball-handling chores. Yes, Paul George, after sitting out the first two weeks of the season while mending from summer shoulder surgery, is ready to check in and make the Clippers whole. He\u2019ll travel on this upcoming two-game trip to Houston and New Orleans and, because it\u2019s a back-to-back and Kawhi doesn\u2019t do those, George could debut Wednesday while Leonard sits. It\u2019s all fluid, but all signs point toward the much-anticipated tandem making its debut this week. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a big piece,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cHe\u2019ll take a lot of attention. Then we\u2019ll have to figure it out again.\u201d Through 10 games, eight of which he played, Leonard felt like he was in Toronto all over again, meaning, getting all the respect from the opposing defense. He managed to overcome that quite well, averaging nearly 30 points and scoring more in fourth quarters than anyone in the NBA. But the Raptors were more relentless and smarter than other teams partly because they obviously have the Leonard scouting report memorized from last year, and they frustrated him. He shot 2-for-11 and missed all 3 of his 3-pointers, taking the hard route for his 12 points along with 11 rebounds and nine assists. A mixed bag, for sure, but not up to his high level. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to play well every night,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. \u201cHe just got a triple-double, though. Almost a quadruple-double.\u201d It goes unspoken, yet is very evident, that the Raptors are anxious and determined to show the league that they\u2019re still a championship contender without Kawhi. The cold hard numbers are supporting this notion; they\u2019re still living in the attic of the East at 7-3 and two nights ago toppled LeBron James and Anthony Davis without starters Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka, both dealing with injuries. They may be shorthanded at the moment, yet the heart of a champion beats within Pascal Siakam , freshly named Eastern Conference Player of the Week, tough point guard Fred VanVleet, and a group of hungry youngsters trying to make their name. What better way to emphasize this point by giving the Clippers and especially Leonard all they could handle? The Raptors did this by playing with a spirit until the very end, when the Clippers simply outlasted them in the final minutes. \u201cAs soon as I walked across half court, they\u2019re trying to get the ball out of my hands and sending an extra defender,\u201d Leonard said about Toronto\u2019s defensive approach. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get my teammates better. They\u2019re going to do it at times in the playoffs, and they\u2019re going to knock down the wide open shots, and that\u2019s what wins games. They did a great job on me tonight by sending an extra body, and I\u2019m glad they did because it\u2019s going to make my team better.\u201d For his part, Kawhi was characteristically stoic in this first meeting with the Raptors. Before the opening tip, he touched fists with just three former teammates; business as usual. There was little to no chatter during the game and hugs were saved until after the buzzer. He\u2019s not one to luxuriate on memories, no matter how glorious. \u201cIt\u2019s over now,\u201d he said of the 2019 championship run in Toronto. \u201cWe won. It\u2019s the next chapter. I can\u2019t live in the past. The team is different for them and me. They want to have that feeling and so do I. \u201cIt\u2019s fun being able to compete with the guys you were with last year. That\u2019s pretty much it. We have a goal for ourselves to come out and win (a title), so that\u2019s what my approach is to the game.\u201d Leonard is rightly looking ahead, to the very near future when George suits up. Finally, this will be what he envisioned when he convinced the Clippers \u2014 demanded, actually \u2014 that they trade for George first before signing as a free agent. He and George are similar players bringing similar skills and impact; George actually finished higher in last season\u2019s Kia MVP voting (third) than Leonard (ninth). Leonard and George on the floor? The possibilities are promising. \u201cImagine having Kawhi and Lou (Williams) and Paul,\u201d Rivers said, \u201cand a team tries to trap you. You\u2019re going to pretty much get what you want.\u201d That\u2019s three players who averaged at least 20 points each last season. That level of offensive fire, along with the defense that the Clippers are capable of playing, should keep LA elevated in the West standings and their place among the league elite. \u201cWe don\u2019t have our team yet,\u201d Rivers said. No, they don\u2019t. But Monday was perhaps the last time Rivers could make that statement. Paul George is a very important part of a package that will make the Clippers complete. The next time Kawhi Leonard struggles, the help he receives will be more than adequate. In that sense, Leonard will be surrounded by better help than he had in Toronto last season. And we know how that turned out. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

After a four-year stretch in which he lost 253 games, the 58-year-old coach not only survived, he emerged as the leader of one of the best teams in the NBA. \u201cThe Process\u201d has borne fruit, and the Philadelphia 76ers have quickly evolved from one of the worst teams in the league to a title contender. Of course, that status comes with its own challenges for the guy steering the ship. Since he was hired in 2013, Brown has done more than coach the Sixers for more than 500 games. After spending 12 seasons immersed in \u201cSpurs culture\u201d as an assistant coach under Gregg Popovich, Brown has developed and refined his own \u201cculture code\u201d \u2014 a unique set of recurring events, along with an ever-present mantra, that go well beyond his coaching duties. \u2022 Coach the Coaches Clinic \u2014 An annual session Brown puts on for local coaches . \u2022 Bounce Out the Stigma Clinic \u2014 A basketball clinic for kids with Autism . \u2022 Team Breakfast \u2014 Recurring sessions where a player will give a talk on a topic that interests them . \u2022 Philly Real, Philly Hard, Philly Edge \u2014 The mantra, displayed prominently at the practice facility with images of former Sixers Julius Erving, Allen Iverson and Charles Barkley, that Brown wants his team to play by. \u2022 Row 1 Dinner \u2014 A first-class dinner and \u201cchalkboard session\u201d for front-row ticket holders, which won the NBA\u2019s Event of the Year award in 2018. \u2022 Annual Media Luncheon \u2014 An opportunity for local writers to sit down with Brown and preview the upcoming season. \u2022 Pre-game chalk talk \u2014 Before every home game, an assistant coach talks strategy and answers questions with a group of season ticket holders. \u2022 Family Day \u2014 A picnic at the practice facility for players, coaches and staff and all their families. \u2022 Ringing of the Bell \u2013 After a win, one player is called on to ring a small Liberty Bell in the locker room. Brown recently sat down with NBA.com to talk about the culture he has built in Philadelphia, next steps in the development of the team and the challenges he faces constructing an offense around All-Stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. (Editor\u2019s Note: The following conversation has been condensed and edited). *** John Schuhmann: It\u2019s clear that you see yourself, in this position, as much more than just a basketball coach. Brett Brown: It\u2019s really for me this simple. When I was hired late, like August the 13th [of 2013], all my friends were having coaching retreats, planning the year. And I went into an office and looked around at nobody. I had a video coordinator that was five rooms down, but I didn\u2019t have a staff. At this stage in my life, what was most important was to try to grow something holistic. I wasn\u2019t expected to win at the start. So you really felt like you could widen your efforts on how can you leave something behind. How can you grow a program in totality? So whether it was a community service thing, whether it was a cultural thing within the existing framework of the team, whether it was just a service you felt like you should do, whatever, I looked at it holistically, not just \u201chow are we going to guard a pick-and-roll?\u201d and \u201cwhat are we going to do out of the post?\u201d So, with that, because I\u2019ve been afforded the time to do this, over the years it\u2019s grown. For four years, less than 90 minutes before tip-off, you gave some of your time to season-ticket holders. Even now, when the games have higher stakes, you have one of your assistants take that time. What sparked this program? Before every game, except for the last two years, I would speak to 30 or 40 season-ticket holders. And you\u2019d go out there and it would be stuff like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play Jahlil? And what\u2019s going on with Markelle?\u201d Or \u201cyou guys are doing a great job. At least you play hard.\u201d It\u2019s not scripted. And you go out there and you take it. And you fight. It\u2019s not like a public relations exercise. It\u2019s, for me, trying to keep our season-ticket holders in place while we navigate through this, for four years, every single game. Two years ago, it became a little bit too hard, so I would send my assistants out to touch our fan base. How do we hold them together? Now that the team is good, why do you still want the assistants out there, keeping the fans engaged? To touch them, to stay connected. I think it\u2019s a public service. It\u2019s a thing that\u2019s not entirely a hassle. I know the benefit, over the first four years, especially, was helpful. We can navigate through some stuff. People talk about \u201cThe Process,\u201d and \u201cThe Process\u201d went two years, maybe three years longer than any of us thought. And most of it, if not all of it, was driven through injury. Joel happens and then Ben happens, and you\u2019re still able to acquire draft picks and make trades. During that process, it was important to keep the boys in the boat. If \u201cthe boys\u201d mean our fan base, if \u201cthe boys\u201d mean the locker room, or if \u201cthe boys\u201d mean my coaching staff, just to try to hold this together through multiple general managers, multiple players. How do you just hold it all together was my responsibility as much as anything. Other teams have marketing slogans every year. It sounds like \u201cPhilly Hard, Philly Edge, Philly Real\u201d is more than that. When I took the job, I was like, \u201cWell, who are we? What\u2019s the messaging? What\u2019s our creed?\u201d This is one of the things that I\u2019m most proud of. I don\u2019t have a thousand slogans. This is who we are. It\u2019s Philly. It\u2019s hard, edge and real. And that\u2019s it. Every video session we have, that\u2019s at the bottom of our banners. And probably, three times a week, I will make references to \u201cThis is what Philly Hard is.\u201d Philly Hard is a physical thing. Edge is a mental thing. Real is sort of an emotional thing. There\u2019s a credibility. There\u2019s no bull\u2014-. You have an amazing backdrop of characters that you can choose from, from A.I. to Doc to Charles, to help crystallize what it is. So we talk a lot about that. And incredibly, because coaches don\u2019t usually have the ability to do this, they let me run with this. It\u2019s been rolling for six years, and it\u2019s how I talk to my team. Where did ringing the bell after a win come from? When I coached the Australian team, after every win, there was an Australian song that the Aussies would sing. Back when I was a bartender in college, when you got a big tip, you\u2019d ring a bell to let everybody know somebody gave you a hell of a tip. So I was trying to think something through, and I give Scott Rego, our team manager, a lot of credit for tying my thoughts together. I believe that this thing will live long after Brett Brown. It will live through the ages. It ties into Philly. It\u2019s a Liberty Bell. And you think that it helps with buy-in? I think that it helps grow a culture. I think it delineates us, maybe, from others a little bit more. I mean this completely. This has a chance to live a lot longer than Brett Brown. Can the hard and the edge live? Can \u201ccoach the coaches\u201d live? [The player breakfasts], where everybody chooses a theme \u2026 We just had one with Shake Milton that talked about the Nelson Mandela effect, too deep for me to get into. They\u2019re fun. We had Cov [Robert Covington] come in with a python [named \u201cMax\u201d] and we still have a transition defense drill called the Max drill because everybody scampered quickly to the back of the room. The players like it, and they really prepare for it. You mentioned the Coach the Coaches clinic. How did that come about? Because I have a young son who plays all over the city, I\u2019m all over the city watching his games. And so I know the backdrop of Philadelphia basketball and crazy gyms and rec centers and playgrounds in the summer quite well. And as I moved around, you got a chance to meet some junior coaches. And one of the people that ran one of the leagues, I reached out to him and said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m happy to go coach the coaches. Find a gym. Spread the word however you connect to the coaches. And we\u2019ll do it.\u201d It started out with, I think, 64 people at Lower Merion High School. I did it the next year at PCOM [Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, where the Sixers used to practice] and we had probably 120. And I\u2019ve done it now six years in a row where it\u2019s expanded to 1,200 people, and we do it in our own backyard in Camden. We try to keep those people on a database and invite them to games, give them coaching tools, resources, whether it\u2019s subscriptions to eCoach, whether it\u2019s the HomeCourt app that they can use on the phone, and better coach their kids. It\u2019s arguably the favorite thing that I do. You\u2019re speaking to a fraternity of fellow coaches and I say to them and I mean it, \u201cJust get one thing.\u201d If they leave with one thing, whatever it is, you feel like you\u2019ve given back. I\u2019ve told them, \u201cWhen I look at you, I\u2019m looking at 12,000 kids if each of you coach 10 players.\u201d It\u2019s just a multiplier effect where you can help spread the word and do the right thing. I like the responsibility of the job that I have. I try to exploit the responsibility and the role that I have in that I have a stage that\u2019s rare, and I want to do good by that. It\u2019s not anything that\u2019s forced or uncomfortable. I really, really enjoy it. It makes me feel like there\u2019s a purpose. More than \u201chow do you beat the Celtics?\u201d Turning to your roster this season, you might have to go back to Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to find a similar pairing of fast-break point guard and low-post center. How do you handle that unique challenge? You just mentioned the team that interests me, to say what did they do so well and what can I learn from them, when you got Magic and you got Kareem. You got a fast-break, big point guard \u2026 And they don\u2019t, at first glance, complement each other very well, especially when you put them in today\u2019s NBA, with the need for floor spacing. At times, they don\u2019t. So you got to figure out that ecosystem. And I think, completely, that it rests on the point guard more than it rests on the big, because they drive the car, they have the ball. And in Ben, we got one of the fastest guards in the NBA. And oh by the way, he\u2019s 6-foot-10. He\u2019s a tank. He\u2019s a big man. And then you have the best low-post player in the NBA, in my opinion, in Joel Embiid at 7-foot-2. And so what parallels, what historical examples might you learn from? Well, maybe the Magic and Kareem days are something you got to study. They were quite big, with James Worthy and Byron [Scott] was a big guard. There are things you can learn from, but this might be my greatest challenge. I know we\u2019ll play defense. We\u2019re designed to play defense. Creating that ecosystem offensively, when you have the dynamics that we have, the skill packages, the size, is the greatest responsibility that I have and the greatest challenge that I have. At what point do you really evaluate where you are with the offense and whether it\u2019s good enough? It starts \u2026 It doesn\u2019t start. It\u2019s always there. You\u2019re always thinking about \u201cWill this work in Game 7 with three minutes left?\u201d Where you end, you should start. I\u2019ve been privileged to see championship basketball and you\u2019re always reminded how things just get stripped down and you\u2019re naked. It\u2019s bare and it\u2019s simple. It\u2019s always about players and rarely about plays. It\u2019s about concepts and fundamentals, not because \u201cEar tug, 32 twist\u201d is a great play. Over a seven-game series, you\u2019re not going to fool anybody with plays. So I completely believe in that. I live by it. That is the litmus test of which I judge. When I have a day off after a game, I normally just watch the game in flow. And it takes me anywhere from 8-10 hours, when you mark a game. And you think and it pivots you off into development or concepts or fundamentals or things I got to do with messaging to our young players, trying to connect and stay with them so they know their head coach hasn\u2019t forgotten about them. But yesterday [after the Sixers edged the Hawks in the third game of the season], I go through and I just watch our defense \u2014 I normally don\u2019t break the game up like this \u2014 and as I watch our defense, I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, if you put me in a closet and drug me out and you watched us play defense, for the most part, I\u2019m proud.\u201d We play hard. I think that we will arrive in April where we need to arrive. We\u2019re learning about Al Horford as a rim protector. I\u2019m learning about J-Rich [Josh Richardson] guarding point guards. I\u2019m learning about people\u2019s switchability vs. I got to keep them connected on somebody like I had to do with J.J. [Redick]. You learn, but I feel like we\u2019re trending where I want to go. Then you take me out of that closet and you put me in front of a video and say, \u201cHere\u2019s the team after three games offensively,\u201d and I\u2019m crushed. I don\u2019t like what I saw that night. I did like what I saw against Boston, in Detroit. I didn\u2019t, at all, like what I saw against Atlanta. So there\u2019s no finite date. I hope, in my own mind, I\u2019m growing it and coaching it the way I want, and shaping it in the first third [of the season]. But it\u2019s never-ending. It keeps coaches up at night. I think the offensive design of our team needs to be well thought through, from my standpoint. On opening night you talked about developing Furkan Korkmaz into a high-volume 3-point shooter \u2026 \u201cGrow a bomber.\u201d Right. Is there a similar view in regard to pushing Richardson and\/or Tobias Harris into a playmaking role? With Josh, especially. I look at Tobias as, kind of, my new J.J. I want him really hunting threes. I want him thinking that way. With J-Rich, you go through the process of \u2026 I believe that, when mid-April comes, there\u2019s a significant chance that he will be the back-up point guard. We did it with Manu all my years with Pop. And if I\u2019m thinking like that, why wouldn\u2019t I just do it now? I\u2019m not married to that, but I opted to do that at the start of the year. I think that he is a capable \u2013 and at times more than capable \u2013 and emerging pick-and-roll type of player. He\u2019s long enough to see over it. People don\u2019t always go under it, so there\u2019s somebody there to actually screen. I think his evolution can be very helpful in that particular area. When he comes off a pick-and-roll, he sees the whole floor, the back line of the defense? He does. And he can go left-handed or right-handed. He\u2019s actually better left, probably, where he can pick off a corner if Joel rolls and they tag. I think that his thought process is beyond a two-man or three-man. One final, slightly off topic question: Are you surprised that Tim Duncan is an assistant coach? No. Not at all. At this stage of Pop\u2019s career and with the loss of Ime [Udoka, now an assistant with Brown in Philadelphia] and Ettore Messina going to Italy, I think Pop is \u2014 and I understand this \u2014 trying to find allies and a comfort level while still achieving an NBA coaching staff. And he knocked it out of the park. You got Tim Duncan coming in. I think Timmy probably felt a responsibility, more than \u201cYeah, I\u2019m dying to be an NBA coach\u201d type of rationale. Maybe I\u2019m right, maybe I\u2019m wrong. But because Timmy\u2019s good people and he loves Pop, I bet there was some of that in his thinking. And for those reasons, I\u2019m not surprised. *** John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Another clutch performance from Jokic?: If you\u2019ve missed it somehow, go ask a Sixers or a Timberwolves fan just how cool Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic has been of late in close games. Hawks fans are hoping they won\u2019t have a strong opinion on that notion ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and get a rare win in Denver. Overall in clutch time this season, Jokic has scored 28 points on 12-for-20 shooting (2-for-2 on 3-pointers). 2. Turnover troubles in Philly: To date, the Sixers are No. 1 in turnovers , which is a category they\u2019ve finished 25th or worse every season since 2012-13 . That topic has drawn the attention of coach Brett Brown as the Cavs pay a visit tonight ( 7 ET, NBA TV ). Thankfully for Philadelphia, Cleveland is one of the NBA\u2019s worst teams at scoring points off opponent turnovers, which means the Sixers\u2019 performance in that department tonight (good or bad) should be considered a misnomer. 3. Lakers vs. Suns worth watching:  Just about everyone expected the Lakers to be among the West elite by early November. The Suns? Not so much. Yet hours before this showdown ( 9 ET, League Pass ), we have a game that could have meaning for both teams come April and May for the first time in a decade. Lakers not named \u201cDavis\u201d or \u201cJames\u201d are thriving in L.A. , while Phoenix coach Monty Williams continues to make an impact on his crew. Don\u2019t miss this one tonight. 4. Knicks get away from MSG: After Sunday\u2019s blowout loss to the Cavs , all manner of off-court storylines bubbled up as team president Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry addressed the media . Coach David Fizdale has reportedly seen his job \u2014 which he\u2019s barely into Year 2 of \u2014 in jeopardy after a 2-8 start. Probably a good thing, then, for he and the Knicks to be on the road facing the Bulls ( 8 ET, League Pass ) if for no other reason than to get away from the New York news cycle. 5. Pacers try to keep rolling: Injuries (to Myles Turner and Victor Oladipo) have thinned the ranks for Indiana this season. Yet they\u2019ve won three in a row as they host the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 7 ET, League Pass ) as they load up on an early-season schedule that has been thin on winning teams. The Pacers\u2019 bench has been hot of late, topping 35 points in five of the team\u2019s last six games. 6. Blazers, Kings reunite in Sacramento: Three of Portland\u2019s four wins to date have come on the road, the first of which was on Oct. 25 in Sacramento . A lot has changed since then, namely for the Kings, who are still without Marvin Bagley Jr. and got word yesterday that De\u2019Aaron Fox (ankle) will be out 3-4 weeks . Portland has relied heavily on Damian Lillard (as you\u2019d expect) this season, but is he carrying too big of a load for the Blazers? 7. That time Kevin Love went for 30-30: On this date in 2010, Love made history with 31 points and 31 rebounds in a 112-103 Minnesota Timberwolves win against the New York Knicks. He set a team record with 31 rebounds, breaking the mark set by Al Jefferson on Jan. 13, 2010 , and became the first player with 30-plus points and 30-plus rebounds in a game since Moses Malone on Feb. 11, 1982 ."},{"id":30689,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gordon-hayward-surgery","date":"2019-11-12","title":"Gordon Hayward has surgery on hand, out roughly 6 weeks","content":"BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward had successful surgery on his broken left hand Monday, a move that is expected to keep him out for about six weeks. Hayward broke his hand in a collision with Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge in the second quarter of Saturday night\u2019s game in San Antonio. He left the game and did not return. \u201cHe was frustrated. He was down,\u201d coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t like last time.\u201d Hayward, 29, missed all but five minutes of the 2017-18 season after breaking his leg in the first quarter of the opener against Cleveland. Forward Jayson Tatum also said Hayward seemed frustrated after the latest setback. \u201cI feel bad for him. He was just getting back to being himself,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bummer.\u201d Hayward returned last season and played in 72 games, most of them off the bench, and averaged 11.5 points and 4.5 rebounds \u2013 far short of his numbers before the injury. He had been closer to his peak performance in the first seven games this season, averaging 19 points, four assists and a career-high seven rebounds before the latest injury. \u201cThe crazy thing is he was playing unbelievable,\u201d forward Enes Kanter said. \u201cI said in the beginning of the season, \u2018He\u2019s back, 100%.

But I know he\u2019s going to come back and be amazing again.\u201d Kanter was cleared to return for Monday night\u2019s game against the Dallas Mavericks after missing seven games with a left knee contusion. Kanter said he was not aware of any limitations on his playing time. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been like trying to get into game shape the last two weeks.

Curry addressed the media Monday night for the first time since getting injured Oct. 30 and said he needs a second surgery on his non-shooting hand, probably in early December, to remove pins that were inserted during the first procedure Nov. 1 that involved his hand and index finger. \u2033(Managing the) swelling is something that\u2019s going to be of the utmost priority early in the rehab process,\u201d Curry said, \u201cto get me a chance to come back and get my range of motion back pretty quickly.\u201d The Warriors initially said Curry would be re-evaluated three months after the surgery, which would be early February. Curry referred to himself and injured teammate Klay Thompson as \u201ccaged animals right now, wanting to be unleashed.\u201d Thompson, the other part of Golden State\u2019s Splash Brothers combo, is recovering from surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The team hopes he can return in the second half of the season. Curry said he experienced some minor nerve irritation shortly after he underwent his first hand surgery, a common byproduct of the procedure. That\u2019s one thing doctors will continue to monitor throughout his rehab process, and it will impact when he can return. For now, Curry is working out his lower body and doing whatever training is permitted by the team\u2019s medical staff, saying he\u2019s using this three-month period without basketball as a \u201cmini offseason\u201d to fine-tune his body. The Warriors\u2019 longest-tenured player had praise for his teammates, who took the court Monday night against Utah with a 2-8 record that was tied with the New York Knicks and New Orleans Pelicans for the worst in the NBA. Curry described rookie Eric Paschall\u2019s energy as contagious and said the play of new guard D\u2019Angelo Russell has been \u201cunreal.\u201d Asked what the benefits would be for he and Thompson to return to the court this season if it was only for the final few weeks, Curry had an answer. \u201cJust to understand the chemistry with the young guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can play around with rotations and just get a vibe of what the following season, when we\u2019re all healthy, looks like.\u201d"},{"id":30713,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-raise-tony-parkers-no-9-rafters","date":"2019-11-12","title":"Thankfulness marks Tony Parker's journey into Spurs immortality","content":" SAN ANTONIO \u2014 Even after the San Antonio Spurs dropped a 113-109 snoozer at the hands of the Memphis Grizzlies, the majority of the sellout crowd of 18,627 at the AT&T Center stuck around to give thanks one last time. A frigid chill had swept through earlier Monday evening, yet hundreds outside posed for picture after picture standing next to a sign bearing Tony Parker\u2019s likeness below the words \u201cMerci Tony.\u201d As expected, gratitude served as the overall theme for all involved after the game as the organization celebrated Parker\u2019s 18-year NBA career with a jersey retirement ceremony. \u201cSan Antonio, it feels great to be home,\u201d Parker told the crowd. \u201cSan Antonio is always going to be home to me. It\u2019s very important that you know that. Thank you, Spurs fans.\u201d Parker\u2019s jersey retirement becomes the franchise\u2019s 10th , with the club raising No. 9 to the rafters alongside Spurs greats Tim Duncan (21), David Robinson (50), George Gervin (44), Manu Ginobili (20), Sean Elliott (32), Avery Johnson (6), Bruce Bowen (12), Johnny Moore (00) and James Silas (13). The ceremony included a six-minute Parker tribute video, followed by the point guard delivering a 16-minute speech to close out the festivities. Having contributed to four NBA titles during 17 seasons in San Antonio, Parker became the third member of the franchise\u2019s famed \u201cBig Three\u201d to have his jersey retired. The Spurs retired Duncan\u2019s jersey in 2016 and Ginobili\u2019s last season , with Parker serving as one of the speakers in both ceremonies. This time around Duncan, Ginobili, Robinson and coach Gregg Popovich took turns lauding the 2007 NBA Finals MVP, who became the first European to win the award. With the four titles Parker helped win in San Antonio serving as the backdrop at midcourt, Ginobili thanked the point guard for being the only player on the team to believe in him when he arrived in the NBA from Argentina. Duncan, Popovich and Robinson, who officiated Parker\u2019s 2014 wedding, each discussed the growth they witnessed from the point guard during his tenure in San Antonio. Popovich even jokingly apologized for all the abuse he put Parker through over the years. \u201c Pop saw something in him, and through the first couple of years, the respect just grew and grew and grew,\u201d Duncan said of Parker. \u201cHe was the hardest-coached individual of anybody I\u2019ve seen in this entire program, and Pop apologized for that. Rightfully so, he did. \u201cBut through film sessions, through games, through everything, he was coached so hard. He accepted every bit of it. He grew so quickly, and I had no idea this kid would be my point guard, the point guard I\u2019d love to play with for the rest of my career. It\u2019s been an incredible ride. There\u2019s no one else I would have rather been my point guard through this whole time. So, thank you Tony.\u201d Ginobili expressed similar sentiments. \u201cWe had a point guard that really trusted me from Day 1. He knew what I could do,\u201d Ginobili said as he turned toward Parker. \u201cFrom Day 1, his optimism and confidence really got me going. That was really contagious, man. It was exciting. I didn\u2019t know what I could do. Having him, and seeing what he could do, and starting at 19, really gave me optimism. I was 25. He was barely 20. But he was the experienced one. \u201cI ended up relying on him a lot, especially at the beginning. T.P., 15 years together, more than 1,000 games, a lot of wins, many losses, hundreds of long dinners and conversations in the back of the bus, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had one argument. Man, not even one. As I said it eight months ago when I was in this spot, it\u2019s been a true pleasure man. I wish you all the best post career. Thank you for everything.\u201d Other friends and colleagues on hand included Bowen, Ian Mahinmi, George Hill, Mike Budenholzer, Ime Udoka, Ronny Turiaf, Michael Finley, Tiago Splitter and Matt Bonner, as well as several current Spurs such as Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Patty Mills (wearing a Parker jersey backward) and Jakob Poeltl. \u201cI think I am, if not the most, one of the most fortunate coaches ever to get to do this,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just remarkable to be able to be with them for that period of time and watch them develop as people, as players, to see them interact with so many other people, to travel with them for whatever, eight months a year. It\u2019s rare. \u201cNot a lot of people are going to be able to say they were with three Hall of Fame players for that long a period of time. Talk about serendipity, good fortune, whatever you want to call it. I certainly feel honored and fortunate to have been there.\u201d Parker, Duncan and Ginobili captured a total of 126 postseason wins together , the most by any trio in NBA playoff history. The No. 2 trio \u2014 Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Cooper \u2014 logged 110 victories. The night before the ceremony, Parker held a private party in which rapper Nelly graced the microphone for the retired point guard and a bevy of other celebrity guests. In the hours leading into tipoff, Charlotte coach James Borrego, who coached Parker as an assistant in San Antonio, was seen inside the AT&T Center awaiting the ceremony, along with Hornets forward and close friend Nicolas Batum and French soccer legend Thierry Henry. Drafted 28th overall in 2001 as a 19-year-old from France, Parker earned recognition on the All-NBA team on four occasions, in addition to being named to six All-Star teams. Parker holds the San Antonio franchise record for assists (6,829) and ranks No. 2 in games played (1,198). Parker also sits at No. 4 on the Spurs\u2019 career lists in points (18,943) and steals (1,032), finishing his career as one of five players in league annals \u2014 along with Oscar Robertson, John Stockton, LeBron James and Gary Payton \u2014 to register at least 19,000 points and 7,000 assists. Remarkably, Parker took over as San Antonio\u2019s starting point guard in just the fifth game of his rookie season. \u201cA lot was thrust onto Tony from a very young age,\u201d said Spurs CEO R.C. Buford, who drafted Parker during his lengthy tenure as the team\u2019s GM. \u201cThe responsibility of bringing a team to its next generation as a point guard after a championship team in \u201999 with two Hall of Famers (Duncan and Robinson) on the floor expecting to continue that run. The expectations that he faced from Day 1 were pretty overwhelming.\u201d Popovich outlined Parker\u2019s rapid ascension, starting with the point guard\u2019s struggles in his first pre-Draft workout, to earning the role of starter.  \u201cWe brought him in for a workout. Everybody heard about that. It was a disaster,\u201d Popovich explained. \u201cSo, he asked to come back, and we did it again. In that second workout, I stacked it and brought in a couple of guys to beat him up more or less. All we did is post. We didn\u2019t let him play out on the court at all. \u201cI just wanted to see what he was made of, if he was gonna fold, see how physical he could be or what he could take or what he could dish out. He really impressed me. So, during training camp and the first couple of games, I was really tough on him; gave him a lot of things to think about, a lot of things to do, put him on the best players on the other team whenever I could. \u201cAnd he showed that he had the fortitude and the courage to do this, and that the challenge of taking over a team that\u2019s supposed to be successful wasn\u2019t gonna matter to him. He was just gonna play. I gave him the ball and said, \u2018This is yours. Figure it out, and I\u2019m gonna love you and I\u2019m gonna dump on you both at the same time.\u2019 That\u2019s what we did.\u201d Over 18 NBA seasons in San Antonio and with the Charlotte Hornets, Parker averaged 15.5 points, 5.6 assists and 2.7 rebounds. Most importantly, Parker produced victories, finishing No. 7 in league history in that category with 892. Parker finally ceded his starting job to Murray on Jan. 21, 2018, after recovering from a devastating ruptured quadriceps injury suffered during the 2017 Western Conference semifinals. Despite the injury being a potential career-ender, Parker rushed back the following season, making his season debut on Nov. 27, 2018. Buford became emotional Monday discussing how Parker\u2019s comeback effort embodied the point guard\u2019s resilience and toughness. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t get as much credit for [it] as he deserved,\u201d Buford said, choking up. Parker would start 21 games his final season in San Antonio, before approaching Popovich about moving Murray into the starting lineup in his place. \u201cThat\u2019s what you would expect from somebody who has his character,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cPlayers that have class, that have character, that understand more about the group than themselves do that. He knew his speed would fade, that he needed to shoot, and he learned how to do that much better. \u201cHe understood younger players were probably going to get time, and his time would diminish, and he would need to be a mentor and help them along the way. From beginning to end, he was just a class act.\u201d Parker finally joining Duncan and Ginobili in AT&T Center immortality at last closes the greatest chapter of the franchise\u2019s history, sending the point guard off as the last of San Antonio\u2019s Big Three. \u201cIt feels awful,\u201d Buford joked. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be on the floor. You don\u2019t see it happening in sports. We were, as a community, as an organization, as an NBA, as a global basketball community, we were the beneficiaries of three unique personalities that probably wouldn\u2019t have come together and grown together anyplace else like they did here. \u201cThey all sacrificed for what was best for the team, for each other. It\u2019s what made them the winningest trio that our organization will ever see probably.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

You see it every time Pascal Siakam walks on the court with a strut, and when his number is called more than a bingo player. You see it when he asks for (and gets) the ball in tense moments, and most of all, how he responds in those situations. He\u2019s developing into a two-way player and filling a very important vacancy for the defending champions \u2026 which means Kawhi left behind something more than just the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy and strands of confetti. Siakam is his protege, and yes, that description applies even though Leonard spent only one season with him. What a season it was \u2014 Leonard blowing into Canada with the gale force of a winter storm, uplifting the Raptors and, in the process, uniting a country by helping Toronto win its first NBA title. One year with Leonard was evidently more than enough to get a primer on how to be a centerpiece because Siakam is very much taking a star turn. He\u2019s playing inspired ball at a next-level pace and doing a solid (for now) imitation of Leonard.  Based strictly on this small sample size and the hint of what\u2019s probably coming this season, Siakam has got next. His evolution is something to behold and is giving the defending champs a shot of security. It will no doubt also give Kawhi some satisfaction and even some stress Monday when the Raptors visit the Clippers ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) and he gets a taste of what he helped create. The two wings will match up for part or most of that game and their interplay should be a tasty subplot within Leonard\u2019s first Raptors reunion game. \u201cI haven\u2019t really had the opportunity to play against him,\u201d Siakam said, \u201cbut I definitely had the privilege of playing with him.\u201d Siakam is averaging 27.4 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game, displaying the flexibility that \u2014 like Leonard \u2014 helps him impact games in a variety of ways. Furthermore, not only is he the bonafide first option for the Raptors, his role and importance will be enhanced while Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka nurse injuries . The Raptors are coming off an inspired road victory Sunday against the Lakers where the shorthanded Raptors halted LA\u2019s 7-game win streak. In the post-Kawhi era, the Raptors are showing the heart of a defending champion at 7-2, but they\u2019ll need Siakam\u2019s presence again against the Clippers and for however long Lowry and Ibaka are out. \u201cThere\u2019s not a Kawhi next to him so he gets to shoot a little more, has freedom a little more,\u201d said Raptors guard Fred VanVleet. \u201cObviously we based everything around Kawhi last year so I think now it\u2019s shifting to being more around Pascal. He\u2019s playing as well as we thought he would and has gotten better each year and we\u2019re seeing that so far this year. It\u2019s about him being more confident and comfortable. And as we go on and the better he gets, this whole franchise will shift around him.\u201d The Raptors aren\u2019t exactly shocked by what Siakam is giving. Maybe the timetable has quickened a bit, and they were curious to see what he\u2019d do with more responsibility. But when Raptors president Masai Ujiri gave Siakam a $130 million extension last month , that essentially spelled out their faith in Siakam in a very stark way. Few teams will make that kind of massive, salary cap-filling investment in anyone unless they\u2019ve got a pretty good idea what they\u2019re getting. At 25 and in his fourth season, Siakam should represent good value \u2014 even at that price. His true coming out was during The Finals, when he confronted pressure with laughter. In his first Finals game he scored 32 points . In the title-clinching Game 6, he dropped 26 points . He was a solid compliment to Kawhi (the Finals MVP) and is comfortably sliding into Kawhi\u2019s role. To date, he\u2019s scored 30 or more points four times, including a career-best 44-point game on Nov. 8. His teammates have complete confidence in him, as does coach Nick Nurse because Siakam is getting all the plays that once went to Leonard. In less than four seasons, Siakam has gone from a rookie averaging 4.2 ppg and 15.6 mpg to the reigning Kia Most Improved Player who sees the ball when it counts. Watching and playing alongside Leonard during the championship run was an invaluable experience Siakam hasn\u2019t forgotten. \u201cI learned a lot,\u201d he said, \u201cmainly about his poise and how he doesn\u2019t get rattled. I try to do that and add that to my game. When I miss a few shots I just stay confident. That\u2019s something he had.\u201d Siakam and Leonard had similar paths in that neither was a lottery pick or ticketed to instant stardom and their progression was gradual. Both benefitted from their team\u2019s player development program, too. Siakam, who hails from Cameroon where the coaching, culture and facilities are not up to the standards in the States, needed it more than Leonard. Both used their athletic ability and work ethic to create the player you see today. Also, they had proper mentors in Tim Duncan (for Leonard in San Antonio) and, in turn, Siakam observed Leonard. \u201cPascal learned a lot about being a pro, about what a day looks like being a professional basketball player,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cKawhi was a serious worker, a 9-to-5er. He came in on his off days and worked. And I think Kawhi\u2019s seen some of that in Pascal. I know they worked out this summer together. He\u2019s learned about having a variety of moves and to do a little bit of everything on the floor, the pick and roll, bringing the ball up, play the post, shoot the three a little more. He learned a lot from him on and off the floor.\u201d  Pointing out Siakam\u2019s drastic increase on offense \u2014 from 4.2 ppg to 7.3, 16.9 and 27.4 this season \u2014 screams the obvious to Nurse: \u201cHe\u2019s turning into a prime-time scorer.\u201d Siakam has grown more comfortable as a 3-point shooter, too, going from seven 3-point attempts as a rookie to 214 last season. \u201cWhen you\u2019re as gifted as he is and work hard, you can\u2019t fail,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cIt\u2019s about feeling right. That\u2019s what I work on, making sure he\u2019s feeling good every day, knowing that we got his back, right wrong or otherwise. He\u2019s going to fail sometimes but we\u2019ll be right there behind him. He\u2019s good, down to earth, nothing\u2019s different about him. That\u2019s what makes him so special.\u201d Now he gets the chance to showcase himself against Leonard. To be considered one of the best, you need to learn from one of the best. Siakam has that going for him now. \u201cIt should be fun,\u201d he said. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

A banner night in San Antonio: Is there any point guard in San Antonio history more beloved than Tony Parker? We doubt it. His place in franchise annals secure, he will join Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili \u2014 his former Spurs Big 3 stars \u2014 as a recent star to have his jersey number retired. The No. 9 will lift to the AT&T Center rafters in a postgame ceremony after the Spurs take on the Memphis Grizzlies ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). When that happens, Parker will be the 10th jersey retired by the Spurs. 2. The Kawhi-Toronto reunion, Chapter 1: After an emotional win last night , Toronto gets a second dose of the feels as it pays a visit to the LA Clippers. Other than it being a solid East-West showdown, there\u2019s the whole seeing-Kawhi-Leonard-in-another-team\u2019s-uni-against-them thing the Raptors and their fans must process. One thing to watch? Try the benches \u2014 the Clippers have the NBA\u2019s highest-scoring one (50.6 ppg) while the Raptors\u2019 reserves rank 24th. 3. Life without Gordon in Boston: There\u2019s no timeline for how long the Celtics will be without Gordon Hayward . What is known is that timeline begins tonight against the Mavs ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) as East-leading Boston aims for an 8th straight win. Hayward\u2019s absence slides Marcus Smart into the starting lineup and it will be intriguing to see who can fill Smart\u2019s vital reserve role in Boston\u2019s reshuffled lineup. 4. Draymond back in action: Given the way how injuries have sacked the Warriors this season, you might be thinking Draymond Green \u2014 like his superstar cohorts Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson \u2014 might be done for 2019-20. However, he says he\u2019s ready to suit up vs. Utah ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ) as he is officially listed as probable for the game. Green last played on Nov. 1 and has been sidelined since then with a left index finger injury. 5, Griffin making his debut: There\u2019s no doubting this one, as Griffin told reporters after Sunday\u2019s practice that he is playing tonight vs. Minnesota ( 7 ET, League Pass ). Detroit will surely be glad to have him back \u2014 but maybe not for his play around the basket. Last season, Griffin made 189 3-pointers, the second-highest single-season mark in team history. With the Pistons near the bottom of the NBA in terms of shooting balance (they rank 24th in the percent of 3-pointers attempted), Griffin should help space the floor. 6. Two notable (and historical) anniversaries: Shaquille O\u2019Neal burst on the scene in 1992 as the No. 1 overall pick and never let up from the moment he debuted on Nov. 11, 1992 against the Miami Heat. Dirk Nowitzki took a few seasons to find his rhythm, but by 2014 he was one of the NBA\u2019s top players, an NBA champion, an MVP and a Finals MVP to boot. On Nov. 11, 2014, he passed Hakeem Olajuwon to become the top international scorer in NBA history."},{"id":30781,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/1-1-matchups-watch-week-nov-11","date":"2019-11-11","title":"Five 1-on-1 matchups to watch this week: Kawhi Leonard vs. Pascal Siakam","content":" We\u2019ve got childhood friends, longtime bitter rivals and former championship teammates headlining another week of interesting 1-on-1 matchups. Here, we take a look at five of the pending head-to-head battles: An almost nine-year age difference exists between these two, but Walker is at the top of his game with a new team, where he heads into the week averaging 24.5 points, while connecting on 41.1 percent from deep. Doncic, meanwhile, enters the week averaging 27.7 points, 10.8 rebounds and 9.1 assists. Interestingly, Walker hasn\u2019t yet logged a victory against Doncic in two meetings. But when they played those two games last season, Walker was still a member of the Charlotte Hornets. In those contests, the guards produced similarly statistically, with Walker coming out slightly ahead as a scorer while Doncic averaged a double-double. The difference this time is Doncic seems to be on another level and is displaying strong chemistry with Kristaps Porzingis. Walker, however, is excelling with the change of scenery to Boston with the Celtics riding a 7-game winning streak. He\u2019ll be carrying a bigger load now that Gordon Hayward is out with a broken hand . Head-to-head stats below are via  Basketball Reference .  2. Kawhi Leonard vs. Pascal Siakam  The former Toronto Raptors teammates matched up only once previously, and you can\u2019t take much from the data produced in that game. At the time, Siakam was a 22-year-old rookie fighting for minutes, while Leonard was in the midst of Kia MVP candidacy. Siakam played 25 minutes in that meeting with Leonard, then a San Antonio Spur, and the reigning Kia Most Improved Player produced just two points on 1-for-4 shooting. But since then, things have changed with Siakam taking over as Toronto\u2019s leading scorer in the wake of Leonard\u2019s departure to the LA Clippers. Initially bummed by Leonard\u2019s decision to leave, Siakam saw new opportunity. \u201cThe door is open,\u201d he told The Undefeated\u2019s Marc J. Spears . \u201cI\u2019m definitely up for the challenge, just like everyone else on the team is up for the challenge.\u201d Let\u2019s all hope Leonard\u2019s \u201cload management\u201d situation doesn\u2019t spoil the finale of what should be an exciting NBA TV Monday night doubleheader. Head-to-head stats below are via  Basketball Reference .  3. Ja Morant vs. Dejounte Murray  A pair of young, similar-framed guards square off as the San Antonio Spurs celebrate the past after this game by retiring the jersey of Tony Parker, the best point guard in franchise history. But don\u2019t expect full exposure to what should be a competitive matchup for years to come, as Murray has been playing on a minutes-restriction as part of his recovery from the torn ACL suffered last October. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has said he wants the Spurs to reach the 10-game mark before the staff re-evaluates whether to increase Murray\u2019s minutes. This outing counts as game No. 9 for San Antonio. Murray has established himself as one of the league\u2019s best defensive guards, while Morant averaged 20.4 points over his first seven games to earn recognition as one of the favorites to capture Kia Rookie of the Year. Expect to see plenty of speed in this one. Last season, the Spurs ranked 22nd in pace with 98.89 possessions per game with Murray sidelined all season. They entered the weekend at nearly 103 possessions despite Murray playing restricted minutes. Memphis, meanwhile, finished last in pace (97.15 possessions) last season, but entered the weekend at No. 5 (107.05 possessions).  Everyone knows the history here, and this game marks the first time Russell Westbrook faces Patrick Beverley as a member of Beverley\u2019s former team, the Houston Rockets. The last time Westbrook\u2019s and Beverley\u2019s teams played one another, the latter drew the responsibility of guarding Paul George while Westbrook dropped 32 points in a 118-110 Oklahoma City loss to the Clippers. That night, Beverley finished scoreless, but held George to 15 points, which was well below the swingman\u2019s 28.6-point average that season. With Leonard now in the fold as LA\u2019s top defensive stopper, he\u2019ll likely guard James Harden, which might just rekindle the 1-on-1 duel between Beverley and Westbrook. The beef between these two seems to have started back in the 2013 playoffs when the two collided on a play that resulted in Westbrook tearing the meniscus in his right knee. Since then, we\u2019ve seen back-and-forth interactions like this and this . Who could forget this one from last season? These two have faced off on 13 occasions, with Westbrook winning the statistical matchup and Beverley walking away with the victory on most nights. So, buckle up for this one. It should be fun.  Head-to-head stats below are via  Basketball Reference .  5. LaMarcus Aldridge vs. Karl-Anthony Towns   In 14 games between these two, Aldridge and the Spurs own a whopping 12-2 mark, including victories in three of the last four contests. Karl-Anthony Towns returned from a two-game suspension Wednesday and put up 25 points to go with 13 rebounds in a 137-121 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. Aldridge, meanwhile, shook off a slow start to the season on Thursday to lead San Antonio with a season-high 39 points in a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Aldridge, admittedly, is still trying to find a rhythm; an effort somewhat hampered by trying to adjust to Murray working his way back into the starting lineup. But the Aldridge-Murray chemistry is gradually improving. On the other side, Towns has added an element to his game that could potentially cause Aldridge fits in this matchup. Like Aldridge, Towns can easily hit the mid-range jumper. He also entered the weekend averaging nine attempts from deep per game, and he\u2019s hitting 45.1% of those shots. Scary, right? The last time these two met, Towns didn\u2019t get on the board until the 8:05 mark in the second quarter. Expect a quicker start from Towns in this one. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference .  Underrated matchup of the week   The series between these long-time friends who attended the same high school in St. Louis \u2014 five years apart \u2014 is tied at 3-3, with Tatum coming out on top in the last two meetings. In fact, Beal congratulated Tatum back in 2017, when the Celtics selected him No. 3 overall. When Beal signed his $72 million extension last month, Tatum jokingly asked for a loan only to be told by big brother that his big payday is on the horizon. But you know how it is in competition: friendships fall to the wayside for at least the 48 minutes they\u2019re on the floor. The Celtics (7-1) have the East\u2019s best record, while Washington is second-to-worst in the conference at 2-6. Throughout these matchups, Beal has averaged more than 10 points per game better than Tatum. The last time these friends faced one another, Beal registered a double-double (29 points, 11 rebounds) in a 107-96 loss to the Celtics.

A four-time NBA champion, Parker announced his retirement back in June, after a 17-year NBA career. The team announced that fans attending Monday\u2019s game will receive an exclusive commemorative Tony Parker T-shirt and other goodies . Attendees can also take advantage of a 3-D photobooth, view replica banners of Parker\u2019s retired jersey and photographs from throughout his career as well as the four NBA titles the team won with him. Here, we take a look at nine signature moments for No. 9 in chronological order: Lakers guard Gary Payton \u2014 still considered one of the best defensive point guards in the NBA \u2014 faced a young and hungry 21-year-old Parker, who obliterated the veteran in back-to-back showings to start that series. Parker opened the series by scoring 20 points to lead the Spurs to a Game 1 victory, followed by a 30-point night in Game 2. Parker outscored Payton 50-11 in the first two games of the series. But Payton would savor the last laugh, as Los Angeles ramped up the defense on Parker, holding him to 12.5 ppg the rest of the series. The Lakers won the series in Game 6, thanks in large part because of Derek Fisher\u2019s Game 5 buzzer-beater . Having earned a reputation as one of the league\u2019s best scoring guards in addition to nabbing his second consecutive All-Star nod, Parker faced off against a 22-year-old LeBron James making his first Finals appearance . James and the Cavaliers didn\u2019t stand a chance. Seemingly unstoppable at this point, Parker averaged 24.5 ppg and 5.0 apg and shot 57.1% as San Antonio swept Cleveland. He led all players in scoring in two of the four Finals games and, in helping San Antonio to its fourth championship, became the first Spur not named Tim Duncan to win Finals MVP.  Low-key one of Parker\u2019s best postseason matchups took place in this series against a young Chris Paul-led New Orleans Hornets squad that took San Antonio to the brink. Down 2-0 to start the series, San Antonio leaned on a 40-minute night from Parker, who led the Spurs with a team-high 31 points to go with 11 assists and four rebounds to lead them to their first victory of that series. On the other side, Paul torched the Spurs for 35 points, but San Antonio would go on to win the series 4-3.  Parker destroyed the Timberwolves for what was the time an NBA season-high 55 points as San Antonio edged Minnesota 129-125 in double-overtime for its first win of the season. Parker scored nine points in the second overtime , in addition to tallying 10 assists and seven rebounds. Parker\u2019s 55 points that night registered as the highest-scoring game by a Spur since David Robinson in 1994 set the franchise record with 71 points . In fact, Parker\u2019s 55-point outburst in 2008 was San Antonio\u2019s best until last season when LaMarcus Aldridge drilled Oklahoma City for 56 points in a double-OT triumph.  Eliminated by the supremely talented Thunder the previous season in the conference finals, San Antonio opened at home against the Thunder . Oklahoma City clung to a three-point lead going into the final seconds, before Parker knocked down a 3-pointer to tie the score at 84 . Parker followed that up by draining a tightly-contested 21-footer over a Serge Ibaka as time expired to secure the San Antonio victory. In the 2012 West finals, Parker promised franchise stalwart Tim Duncan that the Spurs would make it back to The Finals . Parker delivered by blasting Memphis for 37 points on 15-of-21 shooting as San Antonio swept the Grizzlies for the Spurs\u2019 first Finals berth since 2007. Parker led all scorers in three of the four games in that series. \u201cEvery year he gets better and better and better,\u201d Duncan said at the time. \u201cHe\u2019s been carrying us. You can see tonight he carried us the entire game.\u201d  Two pick-and-roll attempts fell flat, as the shot-clock crawled toward expiration in Game 1 of the 2013 Finals in Miami. Parker needed to make a play. \u201cTony did everything wrong and did everything right in the same possession,\u201d LeBron James would later say. \u201cThat was the longest 24 seconds that I\u2019ve been a part of.\u201d As Parker attacked the basket, he nearly lost control of the ball at least twice, fell to a knee, and re-gained control of the basketball. With James defending, Parker spun and ducked under to release a shot the forward partially blocked just before the clock expired. The bucket counted to put San Antonio up 92-88 with 5.2 ticks left to seal a Game 1 win as Parker scored 10 of his 21 points in the final frame. The Spurs would eventually lose that series 4-3 . Sure, Parker led San Antonio with 32 points to help the Spurs stave off the Dallas Mavericks and prevent a second straight postseason from ending with a Game 7 loss. But in this matchup, an early Parker technical foul set the tone for a 119-96 drubbing. With 31.6 seconds left in the opening quarter, Parker shot past former teammate DeJuan Blair for a layup. Seconds later, Parker was seen jawing with the former Spurs big man as they ran down the court on the ensuing possession. Parker was assessed a technical on the play, but he and Blair had been talking to each other all series. The point guard was displaying frustration at times by his former teammate\u2019s hard fouls in previous games. \u201cI was just laughing with DeJuan,\u201d Parker said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so funny to get a technical for that, because I was not even cursing at him. DeJuan played four years (for the Spurs). He lived for a year at my house. I love DeJuan.\u201d  After a heartbreaking loss to Miami in the 2013 Finals , San Antonio would capture its fifth NBA title. Although Kawhi Leonard earned MVP of the series , don\u2019t discount the contributions made by Parker as he earned his fourth NBA title. With a little more than a minute remaining in the third quarter of Game 5, Parker hadn\u2019t yet scored . But over the final 12:16, Parker scored 16 points to help the capture the championship. Parker averaged 18 ppg and 4.5 apg in those Finals , all while shooting 41.7% on 3-pointers (and 47.9% overall). * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The suspension was announced Sunday. It comes three days after Waiters, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, was treated for a medical emergency that started on the Heat charter flight Thursday night from Phoenix to Los Angeles. Waiters, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the team nor the player has confirmed details publicly, ingested at least one cannabis-infused edible and had a reaction serious enough that medical attention was required when the plane landed in Los Angeles. The Heat released the following statement Sunday: Waiters was also suspended for Miami\u2019s season opener after a series of incidents in the preseason and conflicts with coach Erik Spoelstra. He has not appeared in any of the nine Heat games so far this season. The 10-game suspension, which will likely cost Waiters at least $834,483 in salary, began with Miami\u2019s loss at the Lakers on Friday. The earliest he could return to Miami\u2019s lineup would be Dec. 1, when the Heat visit Brooklyn. But that would seem most unlikely, and Waiters\u2019 future with the franchise is in serious doubt. Waiters is in his fourth Heat season, the on-court portion of that best remembered by his game-winning 3-pointer to beat Golden State 105-102 on Jan. 23, 2017 \u2014 part of Miami\u2019s 30-11 finish that season after an 11-30 start. He was rewarded that summer with a four-year contract worth $47.3 million, plus about $5 million more in possible incentives for playing a certain number of games. Waiters has yet to even get close to that bonus money, and he would have needed to play in 70 of Miami\u2019s 73 remaining games to claim the extra $1.1 million at stake this season. That is obviously not going to happen. Waiters has never made more than 46 appearances in a year since coming to Miami. He\u2019s been in only 120 games with the Heat, missing many because of ankle injuries and surgery on his ankle and foot. Waiters is a career 13.2-point scorer and has averaged 14 points per game while with the Heat."},{"id":30752,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/san-antonio-celebrates-tony-parker-day","date":"2019-11-10","title":"San Antonio celebrates Tony Parker Day","content":" Tony Parker is synonymous with San Antonio, so the city dedicated an entire day to the Spurs legend.

The honor comes just two days before Parker will see his No. 9 raised to the rafters in the AT&T Center. Parker spent part of day signing autographs for fans, who lined up well in advance of meeting the local legend. Parker, the 28th pick of the 2001 Draft, played 17 of his 18 seasons with the Spurs. He averaged 15.8 points and 5.7 assists with San Antonio, earning All-Star honors six times and was a four-time All-NBA honoree, including three Second Team finishes. Following his final and only season with the Charlotte Hornets, Parker has since taken on ownership roles for professional women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams in France.

It sounds like should he decide that, the surgery option might actually be a better timeline. So we\u2019ll see what that all plays out to be. Who knows? It\u2019s too bad.\u201d Hayward suffered the injury with 1:34 left in the second quarter after he collided with Spurs power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who was whistled for an offensive foul on the play. Guarding Dejounte Murray as the point guard drove to the basket, Hayward turned to chase, and smashed into LaMarcus Aldridge, who was standing behind him posting up Daniel Theis under the basket. Hayward appeared to be unaware that Aldridge was standing right behind him, as he turned to run with Murray. Hayward\u2019s left hand appeared to hit Aldridge\u2019s right elbow. Hayward immediately doubled over in pain, before leaving the court with a Celtics athletic trainer and heading into the locker room. An X-ray examination revealed the fracture. Marcus Smart started the second half in Hayward\u2019s place. At this point it remains unknown how much time this latest setback will force Hayward to miss. \u201cI was pissed,\u201d said teammate Kemba Walker. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. I was really in shock for the most part. In those kinds of situations, it\u2019s kind of hard to even say anything. You don\u2019t even know what to say sometimes. We\u2019re going to miss him for the time that he\u2019s out. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s been through a lot with his old injury and now this.

Hayward played 72 games last season, averaging 11.5 points. But it was clear in 2018-19 that Hayward hadn\u2019t quite returned to form from the ankle injury that sidelined him the previous season. \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t feel near as bad as it did two years ago,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cSo he\u2019ll be back.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. The Jazz dominated for much of the night at Utah\u2019s Vivant Home Smart Arena, leading by as many as 22 in their Friday clash with the Bucks. But that advantage was gone as the two teams battled through the fourth quarter, with the Bucks actually taking a brief one-point lead before earning a chance to steal victory with one well-executed play in the final seconds. They turned it over instead, gifting that opportunity over to the Jazz with 1.3 seconds left. And unlike the Bucks, they ran their play to perfection, with the newly signed Bojan Bogdanovic sprinting into the corner and knocking down the game-winning 3 as time expired to give the Jazz a 103-100 thriller . DIFFICULTY: You could scarcely ask for a better look with so little time on the clock. And it didn\u2019t take any technical wizardry, either. Bogdanovic simply cut hard enough to create a step of separation from his defender, Khris Middleton, took the inbound pass from Joe Ingles and fired. Interestingly, Bogdanovic wouldn\u2019t have been in that spot had he not asked Jazz coach Quin Snyder to switch him and Mike Conley on a play they worked on that morning at shootaround. GAME SITUATION: A game-winner in regulation wasn\u2019t looking too likely for Utah as Milwaukee\u2019s George Hill stripped Donovan Mitchell with the score tied and just 2.3 seconds remaining. But the Jazz came up with some defense of their own on the ensuing possession, immediately trapping Middleton in the corner and forcing him to travel. Even better, they did it with just enough time to give themselves a shot at victory. CELEBRATION: Standard rush-the-court-and-smother-the-hero stuff. The real fun came during Bogdanovic\u2019s postgame interview, when he saw Mitchell rushing at him with a full cooler of ice water and, like a little kid at a pool party, stood there waiting to be doused. GRADE: You can never be happy after blowing a 22-point lead. But Bogdanovic\u2019s shot at least salvaged the win, and left the home crowd buzzing over what will surely be one of the highlight wins of their season. 4 Horrys .

The 2019-20 NBA season is 9% complete and here\u2019s a look at five noteworthy numbers, plays and quotes as we head into the Week 3 weekend. * * *  Anthony Davis expressed his distaste for playing center, and the Lakers made sure he wouldn\u2019t have to play that spot full-time by re-signing JaVale McGee, adding DeMarcus Cousins and \u2014 once Cousins tore his ACL in August \u2014 Dwight Howard. Still, it felt like a safe assumption that the Lakers would be at their best with those guys off the floor and with Davis at the five, and that Davis at the five would be the go-to configuration down the stretch in close games. But in the Lakers\u2019 close wins in Texas ( Friday in Dallas and Sunday in San Antonio ), Howard was on the floor with Davis and LeBron James down the stretch. In 36 total minutes of the trio playing together, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by 34 points . Overall, the Lakers have been better with Davis at the four (combining his minutes with McGee or Howard) than they\u2019ve been with Davis at the five (with both McGee and Howard resting). Davis himself has been more efficient at the five (effective field goal of 55%, true shooting percentage of 63%) than he\u2019s been at the four (46%, 55%). One issue with the Lakers\u2019 struggles in the minutes in which Davis has played center? James hasn\u2019t been at the four for all of them. In breaking up the time between minutes that James has been on the floor vs. minutes that he\u2019s been off the floor, there\u2019s a huge difference in how well the Lakers have played with Davis at center. In 49 minutes with Davis at the five and James on the floor, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by 24 points . In 23 minutes with Davis at the five with James on the bench, the Lakers have been outscored by 24 points. These sample sizes are all small (plus, that the Lakers have played only seven minutes per game with James and Davis at the four and five is kind of wild). Come April, the numbers may look a lot different. The Lakers may end up playing Davis at the five a lot more in the postseason. But if they can continue to have success in those big-lineup minutes (while also saving Davis from some wear and tear), that\u2019s a big win. The Lakers take their six-game winning streak into a challenging five-day stretch as they host the Heat on Friday ( 10:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV ), the Raptors on Sunday ( 9:30 ET, League Pass ) and visit the Suns on Tuesday ( 9 ET, League Pass ). Gordon Hayward had himself a night in Cleveland on Tuesday, tying his career high with 39 points, while adding seven rebounds and eight assists in the Celtics\u2019 119-113 win against the Cavs. Hayward was an incredible 16-for-16 on 2-point shots, 13-for-13 in the paint and 3-for-3 from mid-range . And one thing that stood out was the control with which he finished plays. These two drives are good examples of how Hayward was able to get into the paint, but then slow down and finish in control\u2026 (And yes, after stopping Hayward\u2019s initial drive on that first play, Kevin Love should probably have made a second effort to contest the short turnaround jumper.) One play that has seen a big increase in popularity over the last couple of seasons is Spain pick-and-roll . It\u2019s a high pick-and-roll with an extra screen \u2014 a back-screen for the big man who set the original pick \u2014 from a third offensive player who generally starts the play in the paint. It\u2019s a tough play to defend, because it requires a lot of communication and three defenders to be in sync. (Here\u2019s the Knicks running it successfully on Wednesday. And here\u2019s Jonathan Isaac breaking up a Spain pick-and-roll from the Mavs the same night.) With Hayward having it going on Tuesday, the Celtics ran what looked like a modified Spain pick-and-roll, with Kemba Walker setting the second screen. But instead of it being a standard high pick-and-roll, it was a dribble handoff, with Hayward first getting a pin-down screen from Brad Wanamaker and then the handoff from Robert Williams on the left side of the floor. Instead of starting under the basket and setting a back-screen, Walker starts on the right wing and sets a screen to the side of Williams\u2019 defender (Tristan Thompson). That leaves only 6-foot-1 guard Collin Sexton to protect the rim against the 6-foot-7 Hayward going downhill. Opponents have shot 16-for-20 (80%) at the rim when Sexton has been there to protect it this season. This after timeout play was a clever wrinkle from coach Brad Stevens. Like the Lakers, the Celtics have won six straight games after dropping their opener. They\u2019ll take that winning streak into San Antonio on Saturday ( 5 ET, League Pass ). The fight between Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns was the big story in last week\u2019s Timberwolves-Sixers game . The result of the fight was a two-game suspension for both All-Star big men. The result of the game was a convincing win for the Sixers in which they often outmuscled the smaller Wolves. After the game, Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders turned a question about the Sixers\u2019 size into some strong praise for Philly big man Al Horford. \u201cIt gave us some problems on both ends,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cI\u2019ll attribute that also to the personnel and the individuals, where Al Horford is somebody who\u2019s carved himself \u2026 he can fit into any system. He\u2019s the ultimate professional in this league. And I\u2019ve always had a lot of respect for him. So he poses a problem when he\u2019s playing the four.\u201d The Sixers have struggled offensively, scoring less than a point per possession, with both Embiid and Horford on the floor. But they\u2019ve held their opponents to just 83.7 points per 100 possessions in their 59 minutes played together. The numbers with Horford at the five (and Embiid off the floor) aren\u2019t as good on defense , but much better on offense. Wednesday in Utah, the Sixers lost by two in a game in which they were outscored by nine points in 12:10 with Embiid off the floor. Philly completes its road trip on Friday in Denver ( 9 ET, League Pass ), where Horford will match up with former teammate Paul Millsap. Additionally, Kia MVP candidates Embiid and Nikola Jokic will go head-to-head for just the fourth time in their careers. Through Thursday, there are 14 teams with winning records . And there are nine teams (all within the group itself) with multiple wins over those 14 teams. That latter group is led by the Milwaukee Bucks, who are 4-2 against the other teams that have winning records, with wins over the Rockets, Raptors, Wolves and Clippers. Those last two wins came with Minnesota missing Towns and the Clippers missing Kawhi Leonard . But the Bucks can pick up another one when they visit the 5-3 Jazz on Friday ( 9 ET, League Pass ). If we did this calculation on Thursday, the Lakers would have been 4-1 against teams that had winning records, but the Hornets dropped to 4-4 with their loss to Boston on Thursday night. (The Lakers, as noted above, play three more teams within the group \u2014 Miami, Toronto and Phoenix \u2014 over the next five days.) The 4-4 Indiana Pacers, meanwhile, are the only team that has yet to play a game against one of the 14 teams that currently has a winning record. The Pacers next three games are against the 4-5 Pistons ( Friday ), the 2-6 Magic ( Sunday ) and the 3-5 Thunder ( Tuesday ). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Heat-Lakers? Count us in!: It\u2019s been a minute \u2014 maybe LeBron-era Heat vs. Kobe-era Lakers? \u2014 since this matchup had must-watch written all over it. But that\u2019s where we are with the last game of Friday\u2019s slate ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ). Why should you catch this one? Hmm \u2026 well, LeBron could tie a triple-double record Magic Johnson set 32 years ago , Jimmy Butler went nuclear on the Suns last night and both teams are really good (Top 5 in Offensive, Defensive and Net Rating). 2. Big man battle in Denver: One superstar ( Ben Simmons ) won\u2019t be suiting up for this showdown. But we\u2019ve still got a matchup of two of the NBA\u2019s best centers \u2014 Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic vs. Philly\u2019s Joel Embiid \u2014 to keep this one interesting ( 9 ET, League Pass ). Although the Sixers will be without their star point guard, the Nuggets are expected to have Gary Harris and Paul Millsap back in the mix. 3. Porzingis vs. the Knicks:  No, this one isn\u2019t at MSG (you\u2019ll have to wait until Nov. 14 for that ), but it is New York\u2019s first opportunity to see its former All-Star big man ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). This might be the kind of scenario Porzingis needs to get his game on track a bit, too. After going for at least 23 points in the Mavs\u2019 first three games, he\u2019s been held under 20 points in the last four. 4. It\u2019s offense vs. defense in Salt Lake:  The Jazz have the No. 2-ranked defense this season, but it\u2019s taken a bit of a mini-slide since November began . It won\u2019t get any easier as Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 who leads the debut edition of the 2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder \u2014 comes to town. He just missed a triple-double in the Bucks\u2019 last game and has been close to getting one in two of Milwaukee\u2019s last three games. 5. The Kia MVP chase? It\u2019s officially on \u2026:  We take great pride around these parts in keeping up with the NBA MVP chase like the rest of the hoops-loving world. And if you somehow missed it, our Sekou Smith debuted his weekly column today with a familiar face at No. 1. Don\u2019t like what he\u2019s got to say? He\u2019s open to your e-mails and your tweets , so hit him up!"},{"id":30831,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-week-1-2019-20","date":"2019-11-08","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: New season starts with Giannis Antetokounmpo still on top","content":" It took Hall of Famer Gary Payton just six minutes to break down the complex, six-month process of selecting a Kia MVP. The metric for Payton is simple: Elite player + elite numbers + elite team success = legitimate finish at the end of the race. Never shy about calling his shots, Payton has an answer to the question before it\u2019s even asked. \u201cMy prediction of who I think will win it this year is LeBron [James],\u201d Payton said. \u201cI got LeBron winning MVP and he\u2019s showing it now. You see he\u2019s almost averaging a triple-double now. Look at the way they are playing and what he\u2019s doing \u2026 MVP.\u201d When reminded that a roughly three-week sample might not be enough to make the best choice, Payton didn\u2019t relent. \u201cHim and Kawhi [Leonard], when I saw them play to start the season, I think LeBron was baiting it to see what they got and he didn\u2019t play his normal game,\u201d Payton said. \u201cAfter that, he realized what it is and this is how he had to play \u2026 now he\u2019s picked it up. \u201cBut for me, you\u2019ve got to have the right player on the right team and his team has to be lifted up with him. That\u2019s why Giannis [Antetokounmpo] still has a chance, and I agreed with him winning it last year. And I think Kawhi has a chance. That\u2019s the three that will be there.\u201d Given the nature of the media beast that accompanies the MVP chase, things aren\u2019t nearly as simple to the rest of us as they are to Payton. There\u2019s much more nuance to the race (a 24-hour news cycle, the \u201cload management\u201d factor, etc.) these days. As much as we\u2019d like to keep the MVP formula simple, there\u2019s a reason we wrestle with its daily ebb and flow. As for James Harden and Joel Embiid, Payton says they need everything to go right for them to get into the mix. But his formula works for only four teams this season \u2014 the Lakers, Clippers, Bucks and Sixers \u2014 making it an even tougher climb for Harden. \u201cCome on man, this is the NBA and we\u2019ve been watching this for years,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThis is what it is.\u201d True, the unveiling of the first Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of 2019-20 comes with an air of familiarity while also confirming Payton\u2019s analysis. His highest finish in the MVP race came in 1997-98 when he finished third behind Karl Malone and the winner, Michael Jordan. Overall, Payton finished in the top 10 in MVP voting in eight of his 17 NBA seasons. \u201cI was one of the usual suspects back then,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut you basically knew what it was going to take to win it. And you couldn\u2019t come up short in any specific area and win it. I was in the mix but we weren\u2019t winning enough games over the Lakers or Jordan and the Bulls. Our record was right there but they were higher than us and that\u2019s what happens.\u201d This season, the usual suspects, so to speak, have kicked off their respective seasons like men on a mission. Instead of dabbling in predictions, we\u2019re prepared to let this race play out to its end. * * * The Top 5 this week in the  2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Season stats: 29.0 points, 14.3 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 1.6 blocks, 1.3 steals Anyone trying to wrest that Maurice Podoloff Trophy away from Antetokounmpo should know by now what kind of fight they\u2019ll have on their hands. The Bucks have won four straight games on the strength of his mind-boggling start \u2014 he\u2019s the first player in NBA history with 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in the first eight games of a season. Season stats: 26.1 points, 11.1 assists, 8.3 rebounds, 1.6 steals Age is clearly nothing but a number as LeBron nears his 35th birthday. His 3 straight triple-doubles marks the first for a Laker in 32 years. Whoever suggested he was \u201cwashed\u201d and no longer capable of being an elite defender only added fuel to the fire for the Lakers, who boast the best Defensive Rating in the league. Season stats: 29.0 points, 8.1 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 2.1 steals, 1.1 blocks You can waste your time with this \u201cload management\u201d controversy if you\u2019d like. Just don\u2019t let it distract you from appreciating the roll Leonard is on that dates back to his Finals MVP run with the Toronto Raptors. He\u2019s settled into his place as the best and most complete two-way player in the league (anyone still debating that?) quite nicely. Season stats: 26.6 points, 10.9 rebounds, 3 blocks, 2.7 assists, 1.0 steals That trip home to Chicago brought an unnecessary storyline and the first clunker of AD\u2019s Lakers\u2019 tenure. But it\u2019s best to focus on all the work he did before that game. He\u2019s already collected a Western Conference Player of the Week honor and should prove to be everything the Lakers thought he\u2019d be playing alongside LeBron James. Season stats: 24.3 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.8 blocks, 1.0 steals Embiid has already vowed never to get suspended again and we\u2019ve got our fingers crossed for the big fella. The Sixers cannot afford it with Ben Simmons (sprained shoulder) reportedly out at least three games . Embiid returns just in time for a marquee matchup tonight in Denver against Nikola Jokic, who also has a claim on the distinction as the \u201cbest big man\u201d in the game. * * * Got thoughts on the Kia MVP chase?

A little more than 20 years later, he has joined some elite coaching company. In guiding the LA Clippers to a 107-101 home win against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday, Rivers collected career victory No. 900. That made him the 13th coach in NBA history with 900 victories, joining Dick Motta, Red Auerbach, Bill Fitch, Rick Adelman, Larry Brown, Phil Jackson, George Karl, Pat Riley, Jerry Sloan, Gregg Popovich, Lenny Wilkens and Don Nelson on the list. (For reference, only Karl, Adelman, Motta, and the still-actively coaching Popovich are not in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.) Rivers got doused by Montrezl Harrell in the postgame locker room to celebrate his milestone. He credited late Detroit Pistons coach Chuck Daly \u2014 who preceded him as coach in Orlando \u2014 for vouching for him. \u201cIt\u2019s just the people,\u201d he said, citing his assistants over the years in Orlando, Boston and LA. \u201cThe players are the most important. They make you better. Those plays you run at the end, that\u2019s the players making those shots. It\u2019s all them.\u201d Rivers needs 36 wins to surpass Motta for 12th on the all-time coaching wins list. Given the expectations for the Clippers this season, Rivers could theoretically be No. 10 in wins by season\u2019s end. He needs 39 wins to surpass Auerbach for No. 11 and 45 wins to jump past Fitch for No. 10 all-time . In another bit of Clippers news was the off-court attire of star forward Kawhi Leonard. He arrived at Staples Center sporting a shirt that said \u201cBe Kind Always\u201d and had a variety of other messages written on it. He explained after the game that the shirt was made by students as a thank-you gift for the 1 million backpacks he donated before the season began to schools in L.A. and Moreno Valley. Lastly, in another case of fashion intersecting with the NBA world, the Clippers sported their Buffalo Braves-styled orange and black Classic Edition uniforms . The uniforms were worn to pay homage to the franchise\u2019s 50th anniversary and its New York state era from 1970-78. But given the historic nature of Rivers\u2019 accomplishment and the special meaning behind Leonard\u2019s outfit, it seemed especially fitting.

Winslow, who has been developed into one of the Heat\u2019s primary playmakers, missed Thursday\u2019s win over the Suns with a headache.

Simmons had an X-ray performed on the shoulder Thursday, which came back negative. Simmons was forced to leave Wednesday night\u2019s 106-104 road loss to the Utah Jazz after suffering what the team called a Grade 1 AC joint sprain. He played just 10 minutes before leaving the game, finishing with two points and two assists. Per Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer , Simmons could barely lift his arm when he went to the locker room. The injury occurred after Simmons bumped into Royce O\u2019Neale\u2019s chest while posting up on a first-quarter play. After that happened, Simmons held his shoulder and tried to shake the injury off. Per Pompey, Simmons appeared to wear a heating pad on the injury while on the bench after checking out late in the quarter. He checked back into the game with 6:56 left in the first half, but later checked himself out of the game with 5:20 left. From there, he walked straight to the locker room. Not having their point guard on the floor altered what the Sixers were able to do in terms of containing Utah\u2019s top playmakers. \u201cDefense is where we felt the pain of not having him the most,\u201d Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said the Sixers\u2019 106-104 loss .

Williamson spoke with reporters Thursday after practice to provide an update on his status. He has been out since Oct. 21 , when the Pelicans announced the No. 1 overall pick of the 2019 Draft would be sidelined nearly two months after having his torn right lateral meniscus repaired. As he works to find his way back to the court, Williamson is adopting a long-term view and patient approach to his career and return to the court. \u201c[The rehab] is going very well. Day by day, its getting better and I think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI do feel like it\u2019s getting stronger day by day. The trainers and stuff are telling me day by day it\u2019s getting stronger and I can feel the difference each day.\u201d Williamson said he often watches the team\u2019s practices and then does his rehab work. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound former Duke star averaged 23.2 points in four preseason games but missed the Pelicans\u2019 preseason finale because of his injury. He said he \u201cfelt some soreness\u201d after a preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs and had it checked out after that. Being away from the team and missing out on his NBA debut has been a bit of a letdown for Williamson. \u201cIt hurt at first,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not out forever so my mindset is just come back stronger, come back better so I can help my team. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of \u2018Alright, let\u2019s go in, let\u2019s get it done and start the recovery process.\u2019 I\u2019m just kind of taking it day by day,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI think when I\u2019m ready \u2014 there\u2019s no real timetable \u2014 when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll come back.\u201d Shortly after Williamson had his surgery, Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin called it \u201casinine\u201d that Williamson\u2019s injury was attributed to poor conditioning. Williamson said the team has had his back in terms of taking his time in recovering, too. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a conversation I have to have with them about it,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of \u2026 it\u2019s a long season. This isn\u2019t like college or something where it\u2019s 30 games. It\u2019s 82 games, so I don\u2019t really see a need to rush back. \u201cWhen they feel like I\u2019m back to myself, they\u2019ll let me play. Simple as that. \u2026 I\u2019m just rehabbing man.\u201d As for the Pelicans at large, Williamson\u2019s absence has contributed to their slow start this season. At 1-6, they are the worst team in the Western Conference in a season in which they were expected by some to possibly be in the playoff chase. \u201cI don\u2019t think people should panic at all. We\u2019re only six games in \u2026 it\u2019s a matter of, it\u2019s a long season,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIf you ask me that question again halfway through the season, I\u2019ll be able to give you a more detailed answer. For now, we\u2019re six games in out of 82. There\u2019s no need to panic.\u201d The 19-year-old Williamson turned pro after one season in college, during which he averaged 22.6 points and was voted to the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s All-Defensive Team.

It picked up steam when Herro chose to play college basketball at Booker\u2019s alma mater, the University of Kentucky. And there wasn\u2019t a mock draft that didn\u2019t list Booker as Herro\u2019s \u201cNBA player resemblance\u201d when the Wisconsin native decided to go pro. As unfair as it might be \u2014 Booker\u2019s a proven NBA talent, currently averaging 26.1 ppg in his fifth season \u2014 it\u2019s a parallel Herro truly welcomes. After all, Booker is the 19-year-old\u2019s favorite player, and he\u2019s admittedly modeled his game after him. He\u2019ll play against his role model for the first time tonight when the Miami Heat take on the Phoenix Suns ( 9 ET, League Pass ). \u201cI\u2019m definitely excited,\u201d Herro told NBA.com. \u201cHe was my favorite growing up, looking up to him. Playing him for the first time will be crazy, but I\u2019m definitely excited.\u201d Booker turned 23 last week, so the reality that any NBA player looks up to him seems quite a bit mystifying. But when you consider the similarities in frame, style of play, temperament, and the several other random commonalities, it\u2019s understood why a teenager who desires a similar ascension to Booker would study his game. \u201cIt\u2019s very wild,\u201d Herro said regarding the identical nature between the two shooting guards. \u201cHe tells me to just keep killing. Keep trying to score. He said I can be one of the best scorers in the league if I just continue to improve.\u201d Some of those random commonalities include Booker and Herro both growing up in the Midwest, being selected No. 13 overall in the Draft , leading all votes as the best shooter in their respective class, checking in at the same height and playing one of the most valuable positions in today\u2019s league. When Booker was at Kentucky, Herro was a thin, 14-year-old high school freshman who was taking no prisoners on the hardwood in Wisconsin. He dominated the state basketball circuit, averaging 32.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 3.3 steals per game in his senior campaign . By that time, Booker was establishing himself in the NBA and, unbeknownst to him, as someone Herro wanted to emulate. When Herro was being recruited by Kentucky in 2017, he would ask the coaches about Booker. Associate head coach Kenny Payne , who coached both Booker and Herro in college, can recall the moment vividly. \u201cOne day during the recruiting process, Tyler said to me that he tried to hit Devin on Instagram or something, but he didn\u2019t think he had responded,\u201d Payne told NBA.com. \u201cAnd from time to time, he would ask me about Devin\u2019s past, and you could see he paid real close attention to what I was saying on what made Devin unique. \u201cAnd then once he decided to come to Kentucky, it was, \u2018I\u2019m a dog. I\u2019m like Devin Booker.\u2019\u201d In perhaps another opportunity to make his game akin to the Suns star, Herro worked out with Booker\u2019s primary offseason trainer, Robbie Haught , before his lone season at Kentucky. Twice a day for four days straight, Haught put Herro through the same scrupulous drills that he\u2019d do with Booker. The resemblances stood out. \u201cTyler\u2019s a killer,\u201d Haught told NBA.com. \u201cThey both have that same mentality, they don\u2019t care who\u2019s in front of them. They\u2019re gonna get it done. I knew he was a pro when we worked out. They both take their craft as seriously as you possibly could. They both have that swag on the court. They both talk sh\u2013. You can see why they compare them, whether it\u2019s a fair comparison for Tyler or not. There are similarities.\u201d Once Herro got to Lexington, Booker began to follow his game intently. Herro displayed a sterling shot-making ability and a supreme level of confidence that anybody watching him would notice. That included Booker, who did the reaching out this time. \u201cI think it was on Twitter,\u201d Herro said. \u201cAfter a Kentucky game, he hit me up, said good game. And then I just got his number through there and we started talking.\u201d Suddenly, a bond clicked between the two. Booker talks with Herro after Heat games, shares with him the type of shots he wants him to shoot and where he needs to be. It\u2019s a sensei-to-grasshopper bond, except this sensei happens to be just four years older. \u201cHe\u2019s like a big brother to me now,\u201d Herro said about Booker, who\u2019s providing the Heat guard the type of guidance any first-year player would covet. \u201cHe calls me all the time to tell me what I\u2019m doing [on the court]. Stuff like that. He\u2019s pretty much just a big brother to me. So our relationship is pretty close.\u201d In order for Herro to make the strides that his mentor has made, his work ethic must be inexorable. Booker established himself in this league a long time ago, and he\u2019s kicked things into overdrive to start this season. He\u2019s a bucket-getter who does it balletically on all three levels. He\u2019s currently terrorizing opposing defenses with his efficient scoring and improved playmaking. And while an upgraded Suns roster and coaching staff deserves credit for his recent play, it\u2019s the work Booker puts in that is fueling his separation. That and his willpower. Three summers ago, when Booker was 20 and fresh off his sophomore NBA season, he went back to visit Kentucky. He walked in Payne\u2019s office, looked him in the eyes and began to confidently spew affirmations \u2014 some of which hadn\u2019t come true at the time. \u201cHe told me, \u2018It\u2019s already happened. I\u2019m a max player. I\u2019m an All-Star. I\u2019m the best player on my team. I\u2019ve proved who I am,\u2019\u201d Payne says, recalling what Booker asserted on just the second-year of his rookie deal, a story that Herro has heard and admired. \u201cThen he says, \u2018So I need you to come on down to the floor and let\u2019s do this hour workout.\u2019\u201d The next summer Booker headed to China with Haught. After the 15-hour flight, with jet lag and fatigue naturally settling in, Booker immediately hit the gym, continuing to demonstrate how invested he is in his growth and the perfection of his art. If Herro aspires to be like Booker, he\u2019ll need to model that same drive and will. And from the looks of it early on, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is committed to doing so. Since he\u2019s been in Miami, he\u2019s been the last player to leave the practice court at times, which, with Jimmy Butler on the roster, isn\u2019t easy. And his workout with Haught last year left the professional skill development trainer with the exact same vibe. \u201cI would bet anything in the world that he keeps getting better just because of his work ethic,\u201d Haught said. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit for him, especially at his position in the league right now. He wants to get to the level Book\u2019s at, and I think that\u2019s why they\u2019ve built a really close relationship.\u201d Herro has all the tools, but it would obviously take time to reach the elite status Booker appears to be approaching. He started the first three games of the season, but came off the Heat bench once Butler returned to the lineup. All Herro did was respond by scoring a game-high 29 points , the most by a rookie reserve in franchise history. He\u2019s moving at a smooth pace and is operating under a solid development program in Miami \u2014 a luxury Booker didn\u2019t have in his rookie season. Meanwhile, Herro credits Kentucky as the foundation for his relationship with Booker. If he would have chosen another school \u2014 say Wisconsin, the hometown university he de-committed from before choosing UK \u2014 the bond he has with his favorite player growing up may not have ever manifested. \u201cAll the Kentucky guys are all close,\u201d Herro said. \u201cWe all wish the best for each other. Kentucky\u2019s a brotherhood.\u201d But make no mistake \u2014 when the game tips off on Thursday night in Phoenix, don\u2019t expect Booker to have brotherhood love on his mind. Herro called Payne on Wednesday morning and told him he can\u2019t wait to play against Booker, in which Payne responded by asking, \u201cDid you tell Booker that himself?\u201d Payne states that Herro responded by saying, \u201cYeah, he told me two weeks ago he\u2019s gonna bust my ass, and that even though I love you and you\u2019re my brother, I\u2019m still busting your ass.\u201d * * * Khari Arnold wrote this feature.

Yeah, me neither. But with the Warriors\u2019 lineup depleted by injuries, Paschall \u2014 along with several other rookies \u2014 is getting his chance to shine . And he\u2019s making a name for himself. Oh, and before we go any further, it\u2019s pronounced PASS-chal. But if he keeps playing like he has over the past week, he\u2019ll become a household name. In his last four games, Paschall has averaged 21.0 points and 6.3 rebounds while shooting 52.7%. His breakout game, in which he scored 34 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in an improbable 127-118 win against the Blazers , captured the hearts of Warriors fans at Chase Center and thrust him into the ROY conversation. Paschall finished that night \u2014 his 23rd birthday, no less \u2014 11-for-19 from the floor (4-for-8 on 3s) as he topped 30 points for the first time since his freshman year in college, when he played for Fordham University. Paschall would go on to transfer to Villanova, where he helped the Wildcats win the 2018 National Championship. The Warriors are likely out of the championship hunt this season, but the Warriors\u2019 second-round pick (41st overall) should see plenty of playing time and plenty of opportunities to keep his name on the Ladder. * * * Last week: No. 4 While other rookies are coming down to earth, Morant is establishing himself as the rookie to beat. In three games this week, the Grizzlies point guard averaged 24.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 5.7 assists while shooting 54.9% (and 60% on 3-pointers). He leads all rookies in scoring and assists and drew high praise from James Harden, who saw Morant score 23 points on 10-for-16 shooting. \u201cHe a beast, man,\u201d Harden said . \u201cHe is aggressive as a young guy, and in this league, some guys tend to be nervous, and he has no nerves at all. He is aggressive; he\u2019s on full attack mode.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Here\u2019s some perspective to Paschall\u2019s breakout week: In his first three games, the forward scored 79 points, the most by an NBA player in his first three starts since Linsanity hit New York and Jeremy Lin tallied 89 in his first three starts with the Knicks in 2012. The 34 and 13 was also the most by a rookie since Blake Griffin put up 47 and 14 in 2011. Paschall came down to earth a bit Wednesday, but he still put up 19 and 6 in the Warriors\u2019 129-112 loss in Houston. Last week: No. 2 The Hornets won both of their two games this week, and Washington was once again crucial to both wins. The No. 12 pick scored 11 points on 5-for-8 shooting with five boards and a pair of steals in a 93-87 win against the Warriors . Washington followed that up with 16 points in 24 minutes in Charlotte\u2019s 122-120 win against Indiana. Washington showed off his athleticism with a pair of monster dunks, one flying down the lane on a break, then another strong finish, this time with the left hand. The Hornets are 4-3, and Washington\u2019s emergence is a big reason. Last week: No. 3 Of all the rookies, Barrett is seeing the biggest workload, but he hasn\u2019t shown any signs of fatigue. Through eight games, he\u2019s averaging 17.9 points ( 3rd among rookies ) and 6.1 rebounds (2nd). He struggled a bit with his shot this week (34.7%, 3-for-11 on 3s), but he continues to look like a star taking the lead for the woeful Knicks. Last week: No. 1 Nunn started the week with another monster performance, scoring a career- high 28 in Miami\u2019s 106-97 win in Atlanta . The guard was 10-for-15 from the floor (4-for-6 on 3s) and capped off a historic first five games to his career. At 112 points, Nunn passed Connie Hawkins for most points ever by an undrafted player through his first five games. Nunn has come down to earth slightly, going 6-for-24 over the past two games, but it\u2019s certainly not enough to drop him out of the Top 5. Jarrett Culver, Minnesota Timberwolves The No. 6 pick has seen his playing time increase this week, and he\u2019s making the most of it. Over his past three games, the Texas Tech product averaged 14.3 points, 4.7 rebounds while playing 26.8 minutes per game. To date he\u2019s only shooting 35.0% overall, 9-for-28 on 3-pointers (32.1%) and 4-for-13 from the line (30.8%). Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies With Jaren Jackson nursing a sore knee, Clarke stepped in and put up some big numbers. The No. 21 pick averaged 12.3 points and 8.3 rebounds in his last three games, and he\u2019s now scored in double-digits in five of the last six. His numbers are even more impressive considering he\u2019s still only seeing about 20 minutes per game. If Jackson continues to deal with injury, expect Clarke to see his role increase. Goga Bitadze, Indiana Pacers With the Pacers dealing with injuries, the No. 18 pick stepped up and averaged 9.3 points and 6 rebounds in 23.6 minutes over the past four games. With Domantas Sabonis back, his playing time will likely take a hit, but the 6-foot-11 big man from Georgia has shown he can fill in when called upon. Darius Bazley, Oklahoma City Thunder The 23rd pick scored in double-digits in his last two games, scoring 17 in 19 minutes to spark the Thunder past the Pelicans, then getting 10 points and six rebounds in OKC\u2019s win over Orlando. Bazley was 5-for-11 from beyond the arc (9-for-21 overall)and he\u2019s clearly gaining confidence as a reliable option off the bench. Rui Hachimura, Washington Wizards Hachimura disappeared in two of the three games this week as his playing time has dipped. In a 131-109 loss to the Wolves , Hachimura had four points on 2-for-11 shooting. He was then held scoreless, missing all five shots in 21 minutes of a 121-106 loss to the Pacers on Wednesday. He gets a mention here since his first week earned him a Top 5 spot, but his recent play is concerning. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 6 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

A reunion in Charlotte: For the first time in eight seasons, Kemba Walker will be playing in North Carolina as a visitor. He and his Celtics take on the Hornets ( 8 ET, TNT ) and this one won\u2019t be all about emotional reunions. There\u2019s the underlying revenge factor for ex-Celtics guard Terry Rozier against his old squad, plus both teams coming into this game hot (Boston has won five straight; Charlotte has won three). 2. Kawhi back at it tonight: The Clippers\u2019 star generated a lot of buzz from the league office in missing last night\u2019s 129-124 loss to the Bucks. He will suit up in tonight\u2019s clash ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) with a Blazers squad that has been hammered by injuries to open 2019-20. Although this will be Leonard\u2019s first time facing Portland as a Clipper, last season he averaged 33 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2 steals per game against the Blazers. 3. How is Simmons doing?: If you missed it last night, Ben Simmons had to leave the Sixers\u2019 eventual 106-104 loss to the Jazz because of a right shoulder injury he suffered in the first quarter. Philadelphia is off until Friday\u2019s game against Denver ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and Simmons is set to have the injury looked at further today. After getting Joel Embiid back last night from his two-game suspension, losing Simmons would be a big blow for Philly. 4. Sizzling showdown in Miami: Thanks to their identical 5-2 starts, the Heat and Suns are two of the big surprise squads in 2019-20. Phoenix is one of two teams (the Bucks being the other) to rank in the top 10 in Offensive and Defensive Rating . The Heat have a top 5 defense while also excel at boxing out and snagging steals, too . How Devin Booker and Co. manage against Jimmy Butler\u2019s crew should make for a fun watch ( 9 ET, League Pass ). 5. An early entrant for Shaqtin\u2019?: With a TNT doubleheader tonight, that means Inside The NBA \u2026 which means the first Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool of the 2019-20 regular season. We\u2019re not sure who will be in the mix, but Eric Bledsoe made a case for a spot on the dubious list with this inbounds gaffe last night in L.A. \u2026"},{"id":30827,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kawhi-leonard-load-management-bucks","date":"2019-11-07","title":"For Clippers and Kawhi Leonard, load management just part of the deal","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 It was both entertaining and uncomfortable to watch coach Doc Rivers explain away the reason for the latest firecracker thrown in the path of the NBA, and for his performance, especially in this industry town, Rivers should be nominated for an Academy Award. \u201cWe\u2019re all on board,\u201d the Clippers coach said about a healthy Kawhi Leonard sitting out a must-see (for November anyway) game between the Clippers and Bucks and more specifically, Kawhi vs. Giannis Antetokounmpo, because of load management . Really? Everyone signed off on this? Well, we know who didn\u2019t: ESPN, which is paying billions to hype mid-week NBA games involving stars, and fans at Staples Center who no doubt circled this game in ink when the schedule dropped months ago. Otherwise, Rivers was correct, to an extent. And that\u2019s the issue here. From the top of the organization to bottom, the Clippers had no choice but play it hyper-safe with Kawhi and rest him for the second time in eight games, even though he had two days off prior to Wednesday\u2019s game, and even though there are three days off after Thursday\u2019s game against the Blazers ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). Essentially, they signed off on the fine print included in the deal struck between them and Kawhi during free agency last summer. They really didn\u2019t have much of a choice. Either agree to the body-sensitive demands of a top-five player who can instantly elevate a good team to a championship contender \u2014 see Raptors of last season \u2014 or watch him go to the Lakers. Kawhi hasn\u2019t played back-to-back games in two years. This is his not-so-new normal. The Clippers wisely if not reluctantly shook hands on that detail. Because when you think about it, what\u2019s the harm here? OK, so ESPN analyst Doris Burke disagrees with the idea of resting two weeks into the season. Talk radio hosts who wanted material for the next show are losing their soup over it and some hard core fans outside of L.A. are snickering. Meanwhile, Kawhi is obviously good with the arrangement and for those who think he\u2019s somehow harmed by harsh public opinion, you really don\u2019t know the man because he went through far worse in San Antonio. His teammates at least publicly are respecting his process and Clippers fans starved for a championship have already gotten over it. \u201cKawhi\u2019s going to sit out games,\u201d Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell said. \u201cWe can\u2019t put that all on him. He\u2019s got to take care of his body.\u201d Nobody was denied an entertaining game Wednesday, which went down to the final seconds before the Bucks salvaged a 129-124 win. Harrell and Lou Williams, both elevated to the starting lineup, combined for 68 points. The Clippers, as usual under Rivers, were scrappy all night, just like last season when they won 48 games without Kawhi or Paul George. Could the Clippers have won with Kawhi? Perhaps, as they\u2019re 0-2 when he doesn\u2019t play. His defense was needed against the league\u2019s No. 1 scoring team and Antetokounmpo, who sank four 3-pointers en route to 38 points . But again, this is Kawhi\u2019s World and the Clippers are willing residents. \u201cHe feels great because of what we\u2019ve been doing with him,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cKawhi says he\u2019s never felt better. It\u2019s our job to make sure he stays that way. We have to do right by our players.\u201d If it worked last season for Kawhi \u2014 and it was from every metric a smashing success for him to miss 22 regular-season games to preserve his body for the long haul \u2014 why change the blueprint? This strategy works for Kawhi (and by extension, the team he plays for). He averaged 39.1 minutes per game in the 2019 playoffs with Toronto and had energy in the final crucial moments of several of those 24 games. That\u2019s all the folks in Toronto remember or care about. \u201cObviously it\u2019s better when everybody plays,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an 82-game schedule and guys are going to miss games because of injury or injury prevention. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d Sure, from an optics standpoint, the load management plague is something the league must stomach because such is life in the modern NBA. Star players have clout and the hammer and they\u2019re running the show, realizing that the league is star-driven, much more than any other professional team sport. Their body is their moneymaker and, since franchises have so much invested in them, teams would rather be safe than sorry. The only solution is to enhance the importance of the regular season by either reducing the number of games or the number of playoff spots, and don\u2019t hold your breath on either happening. The Clippers with Kawhi know what we all know: No matter how many games he sits for load management \u2014 let\u2019s say, around a dozen \u2014 the Clippers will be in the playoffs anyway (health permitting) and that\u2019s where their priorities lie, and rightly so. They\u2019re serious about winning a championship and so is Kawhi. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He was on the bench against the visiting Milwaukee Bucks for a national TV game Wednesday night , which the Bucks won 129-124. It was the first half of a back-to-back for the Clippers. They host Portland on Thursday night ( 10:30 ET, TNT ), and coach Doc Rivers said Leonard would play. \u201cKawhi Leonard is not a healthy player under the league\u2019s resting policy,\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cAnd, as such, is listed as managing a knee injury in the LA Clippers injury report.

Paul George, the Clippers\u2019 other big acquisition during the summer, is still rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgery. He is expected to participate in contact at practice soon. \u201cYou could see he\u2019s very eager. He tried to sneak in one possession unsuccessfully,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe wants to play.\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said Milwaukee manages reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in a similar way to Leonard. \u201cWe\u2019re very conscientious of how we can keep him healthy and how we can keep him playing well, being proactive, being aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the Clippers.

Green sustained the injury during an 127-110 setback to the San Antonio Spurs on Nov. 1.

Curry joined teammate Klay Thompson, who is recovering from surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee, on the Warriors\u2019 injured list.

Paul George, though not a free agent, felt the tug of home as well and chose to join Leonard with the LA Clippers. Anthony Davis? He decided he wanted to play where Leonard and George grew up, too. About 2,000 miles away from where he started on the gritty South Side of Chicago. The mean streets of the All-Star center\u2019s Englewood neighborhood had nothing to do with Davis\u2019 decision, of course. He\u2019s long gone from that sort of high-risk, day-to-day living after earning nearly $100 million in his first seven NBA seasons. Derrick Rose grew up in Englewood, too, but most recently has had his mail delivered a few miles and a world away to a spectacular downtown condominium atop the Trump Hotel. Nor did Davis\u2019 successful push to join LeBron James with the Lakers have anything to do with a disdain for his hometown or its commitment to the sport he loves. Just this week \u2014 in the less publicized of his two major comments about his hometown and its hoops \u2014 Davis reaffirmed his view of Chicago as \u201c the Mecca of basketball .\u201d \u201cYou look at the history, and all the guys we\u2019ve got \u2026 that made the league and that didn\u2019t even make the league,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey say New York but it\u2019s not even close.\u201d With which Clippers coach Doc Rivers \u2014 a native of first-ring suburb Maywood, Ill., and an NBA lifer whose much-traveled career curiously has skipped Chicago \u2014 immediately concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s not close,\u201d Rivers told reporters. \u201cYou know everybody, you play against everybody. I mean, how many kids can say \u2013 unless you grew up in Chicago \u2014 you can have a pickup game out in the park with Isiah Thomas, Terry Cumming, Maurice Cheeks, Mark Aguirre, Darrell Walker \u2026 There\u2019s not a lot of pickup basketball games like that. That\u2019s called Chicago basketball.\u201d It is not, however, called Chicago Bulls basketball. All that Davis avoided in relocating to L.A. in July, all that he quietly said no to when he pushed his way out of New Orleans, was on full display Tuesday night at United Center. Sure, they still play Alan Parsons intro music to conjure memories of the Michael Jordan era \u2014 which ended more than 20 years ago \u2014 and they\u2019re quick to rev up the P.A. announcer\u2019s \u201c\u2026from CHICAGO!\u201d if it\u2019s a local like Rose or Dwyane Wade playing for the Bulls. But for now, the Bulls deserve to be penned, not merely penciled, on that you-can\u2019t-go-home-again list for prospective \u201cfranchise\u201d free agents like Davis. At 2-6 after their 118-112 loss to the Lakers , they\u2019re spinning their wheels for the third consecutive season, no more capable of winning now than they were eager to the past two years. Bad habits and repeated mistakes abound. Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen are supposed to be pushing for All-Star Game spots when it comes to Chicago in February . However, they look no more ready or deserving than they were 12 months ago. Coach Jim Boylen remains unproven, still saddled by perceptions formed from extracurriculars such as \u201cleadership councils\u201d and time clocks players were told to punch. The energy level of the team is nearly as low as its joy quotient \u2014 the Bulls were fortunate Tuesday to get jump-started for a dynamic quarter or so by rookie Coby White in the first half. The Bulls still were up by 18 with less than five minutes to go in the third quarter. But momentum slipped away the rest of that period as the Bulls\u2019 13-point lead to open the fourth quarter was whittled away as a Lakers reserve crew \u2014 led by Dwight Howard, with James and Davis on the bench \u2014 blew by the Bulls by scoring the game\u2019s next 16 points. Here the Bulls had a chance, in an NBA TV game, to push a big, fat reset button on their disappointing start to the season. Yet it was gone in a blink. They all knew it. \u201cWe had them yelling and cursing at each other,\u201d said second-year center Wendell Carter Jr., whose year at Duke didn\u2019t prepare him for what he\u2019s encountered as a pro. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what was going on. We just handed the game back to them.\u201d Said veteran Thad Young, new to these wheel-spinning ways: \u201cIt\u2019s about playing a certain type of basketball. They haven\u2019t played that [way] here in the past couple of years. We\u2019re not the team with several different superstars on our team. We have to play team basketball.\u201d  Any doubt, then, why a talent such as Davis wouldn\u2019t want to set up shop in that locker room? The Bulls have a history of failing to attract premier free agents \u2014 Carlos Boozer in a 2010 overpay may rank as their biggest \u201cget,\u201d followed by 34-year-old Pau Gasol in 2014 . Many attribute that to the old Jordan-Phil Jackson-Jerry Krause snipings, along with agent rumblings and past snubs, that fueled a management-first image. But this current edition is turning up noses and causing eyes to gloss over on merit. Davis, staying away from the door he regretted opening Monday, played it safe and patronizing by the end of his postgame chat with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a basketball city,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for their guy. They\u2019re a good young team right now.\u201d Perhaps sensing skepticism, he repeated: \u201cThey are.\u201d Even a classroom of little Bulls fans would understand after Tuesday\u2019s collapse why Davis or any other NBA star from the 312 (or the 773, 708 or 847) might prefer to team with LeBron, with a franchise that considers a decade between NBA titles to be about nine years too long. Oh, and by the way, it\u2019s cold outside here. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Those include: the baddest part of town, Disney World without two credit cards and to your nearest Popeye\u2019s restaurant expecting \u201cfast\u201d food. And yet Doc Rivers, coach of the LA Clippers and among the league\u2019s more perceptive people, went to a certain forbidden place anyway. He compared someone besides LeBron James to Michael Jordan. In this case, it was Kawhi Leonard . Last May, Rivers raved about Kawhi (who was then with the Raptors), saying he\u2019s \u201cthe most like Jordan we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d For that lapse into basketball blasphemy, Rivers was socked with some of the harshest punishment ever. No, not the $50,000 fine levied by the NBA for tampering charges \u2014 Kawhi was a looming free agent at the time and the Clippers had oodles of salary cap space \u2014 but laughter from certain corners in the basketball world. Rivers chose to clarify the other day by saying he was merely comparing their physical resemblance and that everyone else misinterpreted the whole thing. There are other similarities, though, such as Kawhi\u2019s refreshing insistence on employing the post-up game and embracing the mid-range jumper when analytics strongly advise players to abandon both. \u201cThere is no body types more like Michael Jordan\u2019s than Kawhi because I said his hands and his length,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThat (controversy) took a whole life.\u201d That settles it. But to stay on topic for a moment: For Kawhi to even be in the conversation with Jordan and other legends depends on whether Kawhi earns the ultimate honor that\u2019s annually bestowed on the game\u2019s greatest player. Doesn\u2019t Leonard need a Kia MVP award \u2014 Jordan has five \u2014 to be classified as a generational talent? It\u2019s the only pat on the back elusive to Leonard, who has yet to raise that trophy, shed tears and give thanks to those who paved the way (which is the standard reaction and scenario on NBA Awards night ). Yes, this is the gift the basketball gods can give to the player who has almost everything else, provided, of course, Kawhi actually earns it with a spectacular regular season. A reasonable debate says the Bill Russell Trophy, better known as the NBA Finals MVP , is the real MVP (with all due respect to Kevin Durant\u2019s mom ). That\u2019s because the Finals MVP \u2014 other than Jerry West in 1969 \u2014 takes home that and the NBA championship trophy. Kawhi has not one, but two Finals MVPs \u2026 and with different teams, making it all the more impressive . Should he win another with the Clippers, he\u2019d become the first player to pull off three with three. There\u2019s almost no debate that, from April until now, Kawhi has dibs on the best player in the NBA. He went scorched earth through the playoffs last spring, then erased Golden State on the Warriors\u2019 own floor in The Finals. Already this season , he\u2019s averaging 29.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.3 steals per game. But it comes as a major disappointment \u2014 there\u2019s no other way to classify it, really \u2014 that Kawhi is skipping Wednesday\u2019s game against the reigning MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo, because of the scourge known as load management. The Clippers host the Blazers on Thursday and for the second time this season , Kawhi will not play the first game of a back-to-back. Fairly or not, the MVP award is far-reaching and richly defining to one\u2019s legacy. To place it into context, while Kawhi won a dramatic duel against Giannis in the 2019 playoffs , the MVP score is Giannis 1, Kawhi 0. In the 2019-20 NBA.com GM Survey , Giannis received 52% of the vote for MVP (to Leonard\u2019s 10%). While there were perhaps some circumstances that swayed some of that vote \u2014 Kawhi will eventually partner with Paul George , who will unburden his co-star with the load when he gets healthy while Giannis is a singular star with the Bucks \u2014 the perception that Giannis is the better force and all-around talent is commonly held. Speaking of MVP circumstances, Kawhi hasn\u2019t had many on his side during his career to date. He was late developing into a star, he played seven of his first eight seasons in a Spurs system that emphasizes team play, and until very lately lacked the offensive pop necessary for serious MVP consideration. Last season, he finished ninth in MVP voting . His postseason body of work is superior to his regular seasons, and again, there\u2019s no shame in that. Had he made both free throws with 19 seconds left in Game 6 of the 2013 Finals , he\u2019d have three championships and possibly three Finals MVPs because his defense on LeBron James in that series was stellar. Instead, he missed the first free throw, and then Ray Allen hit his famous shot .  T his season is Kawhi\u2019s best chance to win the \u201clesser\u201d MVP award. For starters, he\u2019s at his absolute peak as a player. His body is strong and healthy. His ability to score, especially off the dribble, is almost unmatched right now in the league. His defense remains elite as Kawhi is adept once again at stripping his man clean of the ball in the open floor and providing help on the perimeter and in the paint. Finally, his overall numbers, so far, are superior across the board. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that, for the first time, Kawhi plays in a large market. The Clippers, by virtue of their status as title favorites, will get maximum glare all season. Should they finish at or near the top in the prickly Western Conference, it would be more impressive than Giannis elevating the Bucks to the top in the East. Kawhi\u2019s three main drawbacks in his MVP quest are as follows: 1. George will command a portion of the offense from Kawhi and impact things once he returns. Remember: George finished third in MVP voting last season. Kawhi\u2019s scoring average could take a hit. Voters are a strange bunch as they often \u201cpenalize\u201d an MVP candidate who must share the load, although that never stopped Jordan (Scottie Pippen) or LeBron (Dwyane Wade) from winning MVPs in the past. 2. With load management all the rage, it\u2019s possible Kawhi may miss a dozen games or more. Counting the Bucks game, he has already missed two of the Clippers\u2019 first eight games for rest reasons. This comes after a preseason in which he played limited minutes. The Clippers are all about the championship this season and if that means being overly cautious with Kawhi, so be it. Plus, managing his minutes paid off for the Raptors last spring. 3. The MVP competition is spicy. Besides Giannis, there\u2019s LeBron, Anthony Davis, James Harden and Joel Embiid, among others , in the mix. All are off to solid starts and could have their teams in the 50-or 60-win range. At 28, Leonard has multiple chances left to get his first MVP. He just needs to convince the basketball community that he is, indeed, the best player in the NBA. Up until this point, that hasn\u2019t been the case, mainly because of LeBron, Kevin Durant and now, Antetokounmpo. With a push from his 2019 Finals run , along with a hot start this season, Kawhi owns pole position on the award for the first time in his career. He\u2019s also following the right blueprint by copying a six-time winner. If you can\u2019t be Jordan, it makes sense to play a similar game and come as close as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the guys that everyone looks up to from a competitive standpoint and how he approached every game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYou try to nitpick what you can take from him and take it into yourself.\u201d  * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

An East vs. West showdown:  The Clippers and Bucks have lived up to the hype thus far, with each entrenched among the contenders in the West and East. While Kawhi Leonard ( load management ) is out tonight ( 10 ET, ESPN ), this game will still feature two of the top three teams in Offensive Rating this season. The Clippers have proved at times to have more than enough firepower to keep pace with elite squads like the Bucks. 2. Embiid back in the mix tonight:  Philadelphia was dealt its first loss of the season on Monday with a 114-109 loss to Phoenix . That defeat came as center Joel Embiid, who was serving the second of his two-game suspension, was sidelined. He\u2019ll return tonight in Utah ( 9 ET, League Pass ) in what should be a good matchup with Jazz center and the reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert. 3. Towns makes his return, too: Like Embiid, Towns was serving a two-game suspension after he and Embiid tussled last week. Like the Sixers, the Wolves went 1-1 with their star big man out. As the Wolves visit the Grizzlies ( 8 ET, League Pass ), keep an eye on Gorgui Dieng. The veteran big man filled in nicely during Towns\u2019 absence and could wreak some havoc against a youthful Memphis frontline. 4. Keeping up with the Jameses: Luka Doncic is tied with LeBron James for the league lead in triple-doubles ( three apiece ). Doncic is going for his third straight triple-double \u2026 a feat LeBron accomplished last night in Chicago. Orlando visits Dallas ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) and has one of the better Defensive Ratings ( 100.1, 5th in NBA ) this season, which might challenge Doncic\u2019s hopes of keeping pace with James. 5. Not your father\u2019s Rockets-Warriors tilt:  Rewind the calendar a year ago and the latest edition of Rockets-Warriors would be a must-see affair. These days, that\u2019s hardly the case as injuries have ransacked Golden State . However, given Houston\u2019s up-and-down nature of late (and the play of unsung Warriors heroes like Eric Paschall ), this one could get interesting in Houston ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ). 6. Don\u2019t sleep on the Brogdon Experience: When discussion turns to which 2019 free agent fits in best with his new team, it may be hard to argue against Malcolm Brogdon and the Pacers. He\u2019s already set a career-high for 30-point games ( two ), he\u2019s in the top 20 in scoring and he\u2019s No. 3 in assists . (He\u2019s also a big advocate for clean water in Africa.) A matchup with All-Star Bradley Beal is a low-key League Pass game you should definitely catch (7 ET). 7. Happy anniversary, Shaq, Mully & Reggie!:  Between them, Hall of Famers Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reggie Miller and Chris Mullin have combined for an NBA MVP, three Finals MVPs, 25 All-Star appearances, multiple Olympic gold medals and a myriad of highlights throughout their NBA career. Today, oddly enough, marks the anniversary of the NBA debut of all three players: O\u2019Neal (1992), Miller (1987) and Mullin (1985).

While that win made a small bit of history for the Lakers, LeBron James is closing in on some team history as well. James finished with 30 points (on 10-for-19 shooting), 10 rebounds and 11 assists, marking his third consecutive game with a triple-double. That ties the longest triple-double streak in his career, but also moves him within a game of the longest triple-double run in Lakers\u2019 history in 32 years.

His young point guard, Trae Young, was scheduled to return from a one-game absence from a sprained right ankle. He\u2019d also get a chance to match wits with his San Antonio Spurs counterpart, Gregg Popovich \u2014 the legendary coach he worked under for 50 days with the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team. But things took a wicked turn around 9:15 a.m. Tuesday when Hawks president of basketball operations Travis Schlenk called with the bad news. John Collins was suspended for 25 games without pay for violating the terms of the NBA\/NBPA Anti-Drug Program. Collins tested positive for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-2 (GHRP-2). Whatever good vibrations the Hawks generated with their 2-0 start \u2014 a season-opening win on the road in Detroit and a thrilling triumph in the home opener over Orlando \u2014 and a hard-fought home loss to Philadelphia were dashed when Young went down in the second quarter of an Oct. 29 loss in Miami . The Collins news, however, caused a far more emotional reaction. He\u2019s one of the cornerstone pieces for a franchise in the midst of a rebuilding process, one that the Hawks can\u2019t afford to lose for a third of the season. His suspension began with Tuesday night\u2019s victory over the Spurs at State Farm Arena, but the fallout could be felt long after his suspension ends. Pierce described the shock and immediate aftermath as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d He\u2019d only spoken to Collins briefly before tipoff against the Spurs, his day spent trying to educate himself on the process of how to deal with a player being suspended like this. His initial focus, of course, is on helping Collins deal with what\u2019s to come. As much as he cares about his young power forward\u2019s career, Pierce said he was more concerned about him as a person. It\u2019s one of the many things he said he learned from Popovich during a coaching junkie\u2019s dream summer working alongside the future Hall of Famer, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and Villanova\u2019s Jay Wright. \u201cIt\u2019s fitting we\u2019re playing San Antonio tonight,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate this situation that happened with John, and everything that has come about on this day. To get a call from Travis this morning informing me that John was going to be suspended. I go back to the time spent with Coach Pop and the time spent was, how do you grow and help your players? And this is that time. \u201cBottom line is, it\u2019s an unfortunate situation with John\u2019s suspension. And this is what I\u2019ve been charged with as a head coach is to help John and support John, and help him get through this, not as a player but as a person. And that\u2019s where my mind is and that\u2019s where my mind went when everything occurred this morning.\u201d Pierce said Collins was \u201cnot in a good place\u201d when they spoke, the news obviously as devastating to Collins as it was to everyone else in the organization. The substance Collins took was outside the purview of the Hawks training staff. Collins vowed to appeal his suspension. \u201cFirst I want to apologize to my teammates, the Hawks organization, our fans, partners and community as a whole for this situation,\u201d he said in a statement released through the team. \u201cI understand the impact this matter has on what we are trying to achieve together this season, and I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed in myself for putting all of us in this position. \u201cI have always been incredibly careful about what I put in my body, but I took a supplement which, unbeknownst to me, had been contaminated with an illegal component. I plan to fight my suspension in arbitration so I can get back on the court as soon as possible and continue to contribute to our 2019-20 campaign.\u201d Collins is the third player to receive a 25-game suspension for a drug violation this season. Suns center Deandre Ayton was suspended after testing positive for a diuretic, and Brooklyn Nets forward Wilson Chandler was suspended for testing positive for Ipamorelin, a drug that increases the release of growth hormone. Whatever happens with the appeals process, Collins will get the unconditional support of his coaches and teammates. \u201cI did [talk to him]. I told him that I\u2019m here for him. I\u2019m here to support him,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. I know he didn\u2019t necessarily know that this was going to happen. I feel for my brother and I\u2019ve got his back. For me it\u2019s tough. For the whole team, it\u2019s tough. We are losing a big piece of our team. Of course, we are going to miss him, but at the same time we still have to play basketball. That\u2019s all we are here to do, is play basketball.\u201d Collins is averaging 17 points per game and leads the Hawks with 8.8 rebounds. Replacing that sort of production will rest on a roster that doesn\u2019t have anyone else with the profile Collins possesses. Jabari Parker replaced him in the starting lineup against the Spurs. \u201cThere are a lot of guys in here who can play,\u201d Young said. \u201cThere are a lot of guys that are going to step up. Like I said, obviously, John is a big piece of our team. It\u2019s not going to be easy to replace a 20 and 10 guy like that. We have a lot of guys in here who can make plays.\u201d Pierce admitted that there\u2019s still so much to unpack, details to sort through and rules and regulations to brush up on. Collins has to vacate the arena, home and away, two hours before tipoff during his suspension. But he will be allowed to practice, Pierce said. Still, this remains uncharted territory for a Hawks team just trying to find its footing. \u201cYou want to know, why? You want to know, how? You want to know, what?\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI\u2019m unfamiliar to any of the banned substance things. Still don\u2019t know what it was or what it does. All I know is it\u2019s not supposed to have been taken. He failed the test and that\u2019s where the suspension comes, and there\u2019s a whole process behind it and I\u2019m still learning about that. \u201cHow do we address it? How do we move forward and what\u2019s the plan to help John during this time? So you\u2019re disappointed and sad for the team. You feel for John. He\u2019s not in a good place and so it\u2019s how do we help him and how do we help those other guys? Tonight, I\u2019ve got to help those other guys for a couple hours and and then we get back to John when we\u2019re done with tonight\u2019s game.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Collins will begin a treatment and rehabilitation process and will be re-evaluated in approximately four months. The procedure was performed by Dr. Evan Ellis at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver, Washington. In the first three games of the season, Collins, 21, averaged 9.0 points (47.4% FG, 42.9% 3-PT, 100% FT), 4.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists. For his career, Collins (7-0, 250) holds averages of 5.7 points (44.2% FG, 32.4% 3-PT, 73.0% FT), 3.8 rebounds and 0.9 assists in 146 games (four starts)."},{"id":30875,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/monty-williams-leading-surprising-suns","date":"2019-11-05","title":"Coach Monty Williams has Suns surprising, ascending","content":"PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 First-year Phoenix coach Monty Williams is the epitome of stoic, with a coaching and news conference demeanor that ranges from subdued to serious to slightly bemused. He preaches consistency from day to day and month to month, painstakingly discussing how he plans to build this program the right way. So in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s thrilling 114-109 win over the previously undefeated Philadelphia 76ers, the 48-year-old was trying to stay grounded, launching into another answer about how his team had to stay steady and improve each day. Then something weird happened: The facade cracked. Even Williams had to acknowledge this winning run of basketball was pretty darn cool. \u201cThis is a huge win,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis is great for the fans, it\u2019s great for our city.\u201d Two weeks into the season, Phoenix (5-2) is one of the NBA\u2019s surprise stories, beating some of the league\u2019s top teams like the 76ers and Los Angeles Clippers after finishing last season with a 19-63 record. The Suns have had their great start despite losing starting center Deandre Ayton after the season opener to a 25-game suspension for violating the terms of the NBA\/NBPA Anti-Drug Program after testing positive for a diuretic. Now the team revolves around star guard Devin Booker \u2014 who dumped 40 points on the 76ers on Monday \u2014 and a cast of recent additions like Ricky Rubio, Aron Baynes, Kelly Oubre Jr., Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky III and Tyler Johnson. Rubio and Kaminsky were free agent signings during the offseason. Oubre, Saric, Baynes and Johnson came to Phoenix in trades over the past year. It\u2019s not exactly a cast of household names. But much like their coach \u2013 who carved out a nine-year NBA playing career largely thanks to defense, grit and hustle \u2013 the Suns have quickly built a hard-nosed reputation. The 32-year-old Baynes typifies the team\u2019s surge, playing the best basketball of his career while playing big minutes in Ayton\u2019s absence. The 6-foot-10, 260-pound Australian has been a valuable role player for good teams like the Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs, but now he\u2019s averaging 15 points per game, which is nearly 10 points more than his career average. His added offensive pop, along with his usual defense and rebounding, have been invaluable. \u201cHow could it not be fun?\u201d Baynes said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for everyone here involved. That\u2019s one of the good feelings we have right now. We understand that when we\u2019re playing within the system, the ball\u2019s moving and everyone is getting shots and we\u2019re taking the best shots for the team, that\u2019s when it\u2019s fun.\u201d Baynes is enjoying his newfound scoring touch, but Williams loves his presence on the team because of his commitment to the defensive end. His wide body and bright red beard are unmistakable on the floor, and his constant communication and hustle are an extension of the principles the coaching staff preaches. Near the end of the 76ers game, Baynes blocked a Tobias Harris shot in the lane and then played tight defense on Harris\u2019 missed 3-point attempt from the corner to help seal the win. \u201cHe\u2019s the anchor of our defense right now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s talking. The blocked shot he had was tremendous. He\u2019s always on the boards and even when he doesn\u2019t get the rebound, he\u2019s so big he clears out two or three guys.\u201d It remains to be seen whether the Suns\u2019 success is sustainable. Five more games in the current homestand, including games against the Heat, Nets, Lakers, Hawks and Celtics, should reveal more about this team\u2019s true potential. But Booker is among those appreciating the moment. The fifth-year guard did a lot of losing in Phoenix during his first four seasons \u2013 the franchise had an 87-241 record to be exact \u2013 so the newfound relevance is refreshing. \u201cI think we compete with every team, every night,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had an easy schedule to start the season. Some good teams have come through here. We\u2019ve showed that we\u2019re battle-tested and we can play with anybody if we\u2019re doing what we need to do.\u201d"},{"id":30866,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/trae-young-atlanta-hawks-return","date":"2019-11-05","title":"Trae Young listed as available to play Tuesday vs. Spurs","content":" Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young is available to play Tuesday, according to the NBA\u2019s official injury report . The Hawks\u2019 second-year guard sprained his right ankle against the Miami Heat last week. Young practiced with the Hawks on Monday, and will return to the lineup against the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) barring any setback, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday. Per Sarah K. Spencer of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce wasn\u2019t quite ready to give Young the green light to return vs. the Spurs. For now, Young is officially listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d for the game but will be evaluated again on Tuesday.  \u201cWe always wait to see how to see how it responds\u2026 we work, and we see how it responds, and if everything goes well, then we assume he\u2019s ready to go tomorrow,\u201d Pierce said. Young told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that after he suffered his injury against the Miami Heat last week he was in a lot of pain. He made his way to the locker room in Miami and got his ankle wrapped, then he tried to stand up and do a calf raise on his right leg. \u201cI almost fell over,\u201d Young told the newspaper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move. There was no way I could\u2019ve returned. \u201cThis is probably the hardest I\u2019ve worked as far as a small time period, and needing to listen, to do everything I could to be able to get back. If anybody knows me, (they know) I hate missing games. I hate not being able to play. So I was trying to do everything I could to be able to get back.\u201d Young was dominant before the injury, with averages of 26.8 points, 7.3 assists and 5.0 rebounds over his first four games . He was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 1 ."},{"id":30904,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-john-collins-suspended-25-games-ap","date":"2019-11-05","title":"Hawks' John Collins suspended 25 games","content":" ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins was suspended for 25 games without pay on Tuesday for a violation of the NBA\u2019s Anti-Drug Program after testing positive for a growth hormone. The NBA announced Collins, 22, tested positive for Peptide-2. He is Atlanta\u2019s leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. Collins is the third player to be handed 25-game suspensions for drug violations this season. The NBA announced Thursday night that Phoenix Suns center Deandre Ayton was suspended after testing positive for a diuretic. On August 29, the league suspended Brooklyn Nets forward Wilson Chandler for testing positive for Ipamorelin, a drug that increases the release of growth hormone. The suspensions of Ayton and Chandler also are without pay. Collins\u2019 suspension begins with Tuesday night\u2019s game against San Antonio. The 6-foot-9 forward is averaging 17 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. Statement From Hawks President of Basketball Operations Travis Schlenk: \u201cOn behalf of the entire Hawks organization, we are disappointed to learn that John put himself in an unfortunate situation and violated the league\u2019s anti-drug policy. We hold ourselves and each of our players to a high standard, and we are committed to supporting John as he learns from this setback and continues to grow as both a player and a person. Head Coach Lloyd Pierce and I have both talked to him and we believe that he is truly remorseful for his actions. We will provide John with support on and off the court while we look forward to his return to the team.\u201d Statement From John Collins: \u201cFirst I want to apologize to my teammates, the Hawks organization, our fans, partners and community as a whole for this situation. I understand the impact this matter has on what we are trying to achieve together this season, and I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed in myself for putting all of us in this position. I have always been incredibly careful about what I put in my body, but I took a supplement which, unbeknownst to me, had been contaminated with an illegal component. I plan to fight my suspension in arbitration so I can get back on the court as soon as possible and continue to contribute to our 2019-20 campaign.\u201d"},{"id":30832,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-collins-hawks-25-game-suspension","date":"2019-11-05","title":"Hawks' John Collins suspended 25 games","content":" John Collins of the Atlanta Hawks has been suspended without pay for twenty-five games for violating the terms of the NBA\/NBPA Anti-Drug Program by testing positive for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-2 (GHRP-2), it was announced today by the NBA.

Trae (likely) back in action: The Hawks are slumping a bit after their 2-0 start, having lost their last three games \u2014 two of which were played without the injured Trae Young. However, per multiple reports, Young is expected to return from the right ankle injury he suffered on Oct. 29 as Atlanta hosts San Antonio ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). 2. AD make his visit to Chicago: For the 11th time in his career , Anthony Davis is squaring off against the Bulls as his Lakers pay a visit to the Windy City ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). He had some interesting comments to say about possibly landing there as a free agent come next summer. Before you think too much about that Chicago fans, know that Davis has been on a tear of late: he\u2019s scored in double-figures in every game and the Lakers have won five straight games overall. 3. Don\u2019t sleep on the Heat: As of Nov. 4, the Heat were No. 1 in Net Rating (10.3), No. 1 in True Shooting Percentage (59.5), No. 3 in Rebound Percentage (53.2) and No. 4 in Assist Percentage (65.3). They can take another step forward as a legit East team tonight as they visit the Nuggets ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ). Denver, on the other hand, has a -0.4 Net Rating (17th in NBA) and has one of the worst fourth-quarter Defensive Ratings (113.4, 25th overall) in the league. 4. Burning bright out West: Another night in the NBA, another big win for the Suns. They\u2019re now 5-2 and trail the Lakers by a 1\/2 game for the West\u2019s top spot in the season\u2019s early going. Last night\u2019s win against the 76ers \u2014 who were, admittedly, playing without center Joel Embiid \u2014 was more proof that Phoenix might not be merely a surprise team but a truly legit team this season. 5. Hoping to see you soon: While there\u2019s a good chance Young will make his return to the Hawks\u2019 lineup tonight, there are five other players currently on the shelf we want to see back in action before too long. Our Michael C. Wright has some names to keep in mind as the NBA season keeps chugging along."},{"id":30870,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-tv-dtc-official-release","date":"2019-11-05","title":"NBA TV becomes first linear sports league network to launch direct-to-consumer subscription product","content":"NBA Digital, jointly managed by the NBA and Turner Sports, today announced that NBA TV is now available directly to consumers from the NBA, becoming the first linear sports league network to launch a direct-to-consumer subscription offering.

Or Klay Thompson. Or Draymond Green. Or D\u2019Angelo Russell. But they did have Eric Paschall on his birthday. The rookie forward celebrated with a massive 34-point, 13-rebound performance in Golden State\u2019s stunning 127-118 win over Portland on Monday. Paschall\u2019s effort marked the highest-scoring game by a rookie this season, as well as the second-best rebounding night among first-year players. He is the first second-round rookie to put up at least 34 points and 10 rebounds since Dino Radja in 1994 . Such a night was hardly expected from the once-proud Warriors dynasty, who have fallen on hard times faster than any could have predicted. Thompson\u2019s torn ACL and Kevin Durant\u2019s offseason departure had already dented preseason expectations. Early season injuries to Curry, Green and Russell all but decimated them. Yet instead of succumbing to their wave of bad luck, the Warriors responded by going toe-to-toe with the same team they faced in last year\u2019s Western Conference finals. Paschall led the way, hitting all eight of his free throw attempts as well as four of his six tries from 3-point range. Fellow rookie Ky Bowman, who went undrafted in June, added 19 points, eight assists and four rebounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a group of young guys that don\u2019t get this opportunity to come out here and play 40 minutes and just come out here and ball,\u201d Paschall said after the game. \u201cTo do it against these guys \u2014 that\u2019s a heck of a team \u2014 we\u2019re just doing a great job of staying together and keeping a positive attitude.\u201d Paschall has perhaps taken the most advantage of that opportunity, scoring 20 or more points in three of the last four games. Taken 41st overall in the 2019 Draft, the 23-year-old\u2019s NBA high tops his collegiate best of 31 points at Fordham (before he transferred to Villanova). \u201cGreat birthday gift, right here,\u201d Paschall said with a smile after the win."}]
