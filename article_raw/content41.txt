Given where the Pistons are in the Eastern Conference, currently fighting for one of the final playoff spots with 20 games remaining, anything is certainly possible with regard to Stan Van Gundy, who holds dual titles as coach and team president. The Pistons, who lost in overtime Friday in Orlando, have been a mixed bag this season. They executed a big trade for Blake Griffin, who gives the team a notable star, and the initial hit with Griffin was positive. Yet the club still remains mired in mediocrity, and even worse, attendance in the new arena has been spotty at best. Everything falls on Van Gundy, who created the roster and therefore bears some responsibility. The number of coach\/GMs dwindled last summer when the Clippers retained Doc Rivers as coach only, and it could be that a similar fate awaits Van Gundy should the Pistons fail to make the playoffs.

To break into the top five these days, someone will have to put together a string of impressive performances. And that may still not be enough. Meanwhile, another name joins the ranks of the 32-and-older club, just missing the cut in his inaugural stint. 1. LeBron James (33), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 27.2 ppg, 11.2 rpg, 8.6 apg Season stats: 26.7 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 9.0 apg James averaged a triple-double (27.0 points, 10.5 rebounds, 10.5 assists) for the month of February. \u2018Nuff said. It was about a month ago when it appeared he was losing his grip on the throne . Think again, people! If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019s gone for 30 or more in three straight games for the first time this season. 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 3 games, 24.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 22.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 2.0 apg The two-week stint couldn\u2019t have started better for Aldridge, who poured in 38 points on Feb. 23 followed by a 27-point showing two days later. But the strong start was negated by an injury-shortened eight-point performance on Wednesday. Aldridge was forced to leave after just 13 minutes with a sprained ankle, which will keep him day-to-day. 3. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 15.0 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 7.3 apg Season stats: 18.8 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 8.2 apg We\u2019re putting it nicely when we say Paul is struggling with his shot. Over the last four games, he shot just 38 percent from the field (46.3 for the season) and an ugly 19.0 percent from long range (38.2 this season). In fact, over his last eight games, Paul has shot better than 50 percent from the field just twice. 4. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 17.6 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 0.8 apg Season stats: 15.9 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.4 apg We\u2019re not sure what to think of Howard\u2019s last five games. He went for double-digit scoring in all of them (going over 20 in two of them), but he managed more than 10 rebounds just twice, including a season-low three rebounds on Wednesday (if you don\u2019t count Dec. 22 when he played just five minutes before leaving with an injury). 5. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 3 games, 17.7 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 4.7 apg Season stats: 17.7 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 4.0 apg Despite poor shooting (39.5 FG%, 30.8 3PT%), Gasol has eclipsed 15 points in four of his last six games. But what we liked most was seeing 13 rebounds on Wednesday, snapping a slide of seven consecutive with fewer than 10 boards. It was equally good to see him swat away four shots in that same game. 6. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 13.0 ppg, 1.6 rpg, 3.0 apg Season stats: 16.7 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 3.2 apg That separation of powers we spoke about? It starts right here. Redick\u2019s standing was certainly helped by Thursday\u2019s 22-point effort against the Cavaliers. Other than that, it wasn\u2019t much to write home about: 38.9 FG%, 34.4 3PT% and no other games with more than 16 points. And Sunday\u2019s six points broke a string of seven straight double-digit scoring games. 7. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 3 games, 18.7 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 14.9 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 2.1 apg It was just three games, but Randolph did enough (barely) to move up one spot, scoring 20 or more points twice. His 29-point, 12-rebound showing on Thursday was his first double-double since Jan. 30, a span of six games, and the most points he\u2019s scored since Dec. 8. 8. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 7 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 14.5 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 0.8 apg Season stats: 17.0 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.3 apg One good game followed up by three uninspiring efforts. That\u2019s more or less been the norm this season for Anthony, who continues to struggle with his shooting (36.5 FG% last four games, 40.9 FG% this season). Not that he\u2019s ever been a big facilitator, but we\u2019ve noticed he hasn\u2019t had more than one assist in nine straight games. 9. J.J. Barea (33), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 15.0 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 8.5 apg Season stats: 11.6 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 6.3 apg Barea continues to put up solid numbers despite averaging just 27.6 minutes per game. In addition to stellar shooting (51.1 FG%, 42.9 3PT%), Barea scored in double digits and dished out six or more assists in all four games. He\u2019s also chipped in two or more 3-pointers in four of the last five. 10. Dwyane Wade (36), Miami Heat Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 18.5 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 11.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 3.4 apg Moving back to Miami seems to have reinvigorated Wade, who for the first time this season secured back-to-back 20-point games (27 on Tuesday vs. 76ers, 25 on Thursday vs. Lakers). In those games, he shot better than 60 percent from the field in both while averaging just 25.5 minutes. Just missed the cut: Dirk Nowitzki, Taj Gibson, Rajon Rondo, Jamal Crawford Will turn 32 this season:  Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

The All-Star forward, sidelined since Jan. 29 with a broken left hand, said Friday he could return sooner than expected. The initial timetable was for him to be out two months. \u201cIf I can get back before eight weeks, great,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m hoping that that is the case.\u201d Love\u2019s recovery has picked up speed in recent days. He\u2019s now able to catch the ball with a padded glove to protect his left hand, and the progress is such that there\u2019s less risk for re-injury. \u201cOne of the things I can do now is kind of catch the ball, guide it and shoot it within 12-15 feet so that feels good to do something other than run on the treadmill or run on the bike so it\u2019s nice,\u201d he said. The Cavaliers have been transformed since the last time Love played, with their roster overhauled by three trades before the deadline. Cleveland is just 3-4 since adding guards George Hill, Jordan Clarkson and forwards Rodney Hood and Larry Nance Jr. But Love has been encouraged by the infusion of talent and is excited about the team\u2019s prospects once he returns. Reduced to a role of interested observer, Love has watched as coach Tyronn Lue force feeds numerous offensive sets and defensive principles to players who began the season in different systems. The new-look Cavs have had some great moments, and more than a few tough ones. Following Thursday\u2019s home loss to Philadelphia, Lue said he planned to simplify things for his new players. On Friday, the Cavs watched film and afterward Lue said he\u2019s still confident his club will mesh. \u201cI feel good about this team,\u201d Lue said. \u201cNo doubt about it. We got a lot of young talent. We got a lot of good pieces. We\u2019re just trying to figure it out, put it together. We\u2019ve only played seven games right now and those guys are still trying to figure it out.\u201d There will be another adjustment when Love returns, but it won\u2019t be as if Lue has to re-teach him how to play with LeBron James, J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson, the four players remaining from Cleveland\u2019s 2016 NBA title team. The Cavs may not be the same, but Love believes they remain strong. \u201cWe have guys who have been here and know exactly what to expect moving forward,\u201d said Love, who is averaging 17.9 points, 9.4 rebounds and shooting 40 percent on 3-pointers. \u201cSo it\u2019s on us to bring everybody along and have veteran guys push maybe the younger guys or the new guys through the process. \u2026 \u201cThe coaching staff has remained the same so we know what they want out of us. Having some new blood and some new faces in some ways can be a good thing because they\u2019re going to be very hungry and want to get on that quick learning curve to make it so we have a big run.\u201d"},{"id":41513,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-jr-smith-suspended-one-game-team","date":"2018-03-02","title":"Reports: J.R.

And yet in perfect market symmetry, an equal number of money men would be pushing investors to \u201cBuy, buy, buy!\u201d Wall stock because Washington\u2019s recent run has driven down the franchise guy\u2019s reputation and perceived value. Realistically, Wall\u2019s four-year, $170 million extension that kicks in with the 2019-20 season at $37.8 million, escalating to $46.8 million by 2022-23, means that his price-to-winning ratio always is going to be steep. But his stock has been battered during the Wizards\u2019 9-4 mark during Wall\u2019s rehab , which continues as the team hosts the Toronto Raptors tonight. This season, Washington is 21-16 (.568) with Wall and 15-10 (.600) without him. That includes this post-surgery stretch that still has an estimated 2-to-4 weeks left. But the Wizards made it through February, and if they must make it through March, they seem prepared. It\u2019s generally a given in the NBA that teams are supposed to sag when their best players are sidelined. In fact, it\u2019s often used in making MVP cases, as in \u201cHow much worse was his team when he didn\u2019t play?\u201d And then there\u2019s Wall. With his ball dominance as triggerman of Washington\u2019s system, with his perennially high usage rate (27.3), Wall by all measures should be missed as much as any player just shy of the elite tier. Coach Scott Brooks believes that some games early in the season that Wall missed with first a shoulder injury, then soreness in that left knee, forced the Wizards onto a learning curve in playing without him. Realizing with the surgery that he would be out so long dialed up the urgency and took away any wiggle room on the court. \u201cWe had to change the way we play,\u201d Brooks said earlier this week, before a victory in Milwaukee. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect [backup] Tomas [Satoransky] to play like John, so we had to move things around. I think our guys have really bought into that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t without hiccups. The Wizards reeled off five consecutive victories after Wall\u2019s surgery, sparking some \u201cthey\u2019re better without him\u201d chatter. In trying to explain the difference, Wall vs. no Wall, backcourt mate Bradley Beal offered an \u201ceverybody eats\u201d comment that flared into perceived criticism of Wall\u2019s style and tested the team\u2019s chemistry. Since then, with a few losses mixed in, things have simmered down. And Beal has gotten more political in his responses. \u201cThe biggest thing is just, everybody has to step up,\u201d Beal said. \u201cThat\u2019s just plain and simple, because those are big shoes to fill. John is as important to the team as \u2026 it\u2019s not even comparable to anything we\u2019ve experienced before. So when he goes down, that\u2019s a major blow to our team. \u201cWhat John does and what he brings on both ends of the floor is not replaceable by one person.\u201d For the record, Wall\u2019s 2017-18 numbers when he went out were in relative sync with his career averages : 19.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 9.3 assists per game with an effective field-goal percentage of 46.1 percent . They were down from last season (23.1 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 10.7 apg) but Wall was hurting. He played well enough to earn his fifth All-Star selection and remains a pillar of the Washington franchise (only Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes and Gus Johnson have logged more minutes than Wall ). Beal, though, earned his first All-Star appearance in part for how he grew his game in Wall\u2019s absences. He has added initiator to his familiar scoring duties, hitting career bests in assists ( 4.5 per game ) and usage percentage (28.1) . And whereas the Wizards were 7-8 when Wall dished 10 or more assists, they are 19-9 when Beal passes for five or more. Washington has been among the NBA\u2019s top 10 in assists the past five seasons, but the ball is moving more and earlier in the shot clock as Satoransky passes and cuts (compared to Wall\u2019s dribble orchestration). Over its past 14 games, Washington has assisted on 71.1 percent of its field goals and, since Wall\u2019s surgery, has averaged 29.1 apg . Said teammate Markieff Morris of Beal: \u201cI\u2019ve already known, being in the league with him these past years, he\u2019s an outstanding scorer. But he\u2019s definitely facilitating a lot better, or a lot more, with the ball being in his hands without Wall. We need that and to be the leader he\u2019s been to carry us.\u201d Otto Porter Jr. and Kelly Oubre Jr. have accelerated in their development as their opportunities have increased with Wall out. Porter, 24, has averaged 19.1 ppg over his last 12 games , shooting 52.3 percent. Oubre, 22, has keyed a bench that has upped its production from 27 ppg last season to 35 in \u201817-18 . Specifically, the reserves have chipped in an extra 4.5 points on nights when Wall hasn\u2019t played. \u201cJust the flow of the game,\u201d Oubre said. \u201cJohn has the talent to pretty much take over a game by himself, and in his absence, we\u2019re making sure everybody steps up.\u201d The challenge is to sustain it. The schedule has turned nasty on the Wizards, as rough as any team\u2019s in the East. This is the fourth game against Toronto Wall will miss. Then 13 of the final 19 games after that will be against teams currently in playoff position . Washington faces three sets of back-to-backs in its final seven games, wrapping the schedule with five in seven nights. Working Wall back into the lineup while also retaining some of the characteristics that have buoyed them through his layoff is what Brooks and his players need to do. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit here and say the ball doesn\u2019t move when John is here,\u201d Beal said. \u201cThe ball does move. It\u2019s just a matter of making the right reads and getting off early. When he gets back, everything\u2019s going to be the same. Nothing\u2019s gonna change.\u201d Said Morris: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be [a big adjustment]. Should be the same exact team we had last year. But we can\u2019t wait till he gets back, we added another dimension to us. The bench will get Tomas back and pick up even more for us.\u201d Satoransky, the 6-foot-7 second-year guard, has hit 15 of his last 25 3-point attempts and scored in double digits 13 times. His play has some Wizards insiders hoping to see a swift, small specialty lineup of three guards with Porter and Oubre. Brooks isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to adding that wrinkle, now that Satoransky has sufficient reps and confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve thought his best assets to this team are being able to be a multi-, like a utility-type player,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHe can play 3, 2 and 1. I think he understands that he can be effective at playing off the ball. If he does play with John, we\u2019ve got two really good pick-and-roll players. We\u2019ve got two good decision-makers. We definitely can go that route if needed.\u201d It would be the Wizards\u2019 second major positive out of Wall\u2019s absence.

A healthy byproduct of the All-Star big man\u2019s historic month has been a surprising late-season playoff push for his New Orleans Pelicans, who sit in the sixth spot in the Western Conference ( and just a game out of third place ) this morning. That\u2019s similar territory Davis occupies in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder (No. 5), his first time in the top five this season. * NBA.com\/Stats:  Davis operating on another level of late It\u2019s the perfect storm for Davis and the Pelicans, who were written off by some after his fellow All-Star big man DeMarcus Cousins was lost for the season to an Achilles injury Jan. 26 . The Pelicans lost five of their first six games without Cousins, but have since rebounded for seven straight wins, their longest such streak in the Davis era. Davis has been off the charts during the streak, averaging 39.3 points and 15 rebounds to help change the Pelicans\u2019 season with one scintillating performance after another . His monster February \u2014 he joined Hall of Famer Moses Malone as the only player in the past 40 seasons to average at least 35 points and 13 rebounds for an entire month \u2014 earned him Kia Player of the Month honors for the Western Conference . That\u2019s impressive, considering James Harden, who remains atop the Kia MVP Ladder, is busy leading his Houston Rockets to their second win streak of 14 or more games this season . But it makes sense when you consider that only two other players over the last 10 years \u2014 Kevin Durant (35.9 in January 2014) and Stephen Curry (36.7 in February 2016) \u2014 have managed scoring averages that high for an entire month (with a minimum of 10 games played). If anyone was sleeping on Davis, they should be wide awake heading into the season\u2019s final six weeks. He\u2019s been at the forefront of a talented group of 25-and-under NBA superstars for some time. But now he\u2019s got his team, after that 8-3 month, primed to take advantage of his status as one of the game\u2019s very best. He finished February ranked first in scoring , third in rebounding , second in steals (2.5) and tied for third in blocks (2.2), making him the first player in NBA history to reach those marks in a calendar month since 1973-74 (when steals and blocks became official statistics). Those kinds of numbers make it easy to make a case for plenty of awards. And, yes, that includes a late rush for Kia MVP. * * * The top five in the Week 20 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.3 points, 9.0 assists, 5.2 rebounds The brilliance of Harden\u2019s season isn\u2019t just the highlights plays, of which he has many (see his crossover destruction of Wesley Johnson on Wednesday ). It\u2019s the consistency of his excellence during the course of a season that has seen the Rockets challenge the Golden State Warriors for the top spot in the Western Conference. Only once during the Rockets\u2019 current 14-game win streak has Harden failed to score 25 or more points. And he has a 60-point effort , two 41-point outings and six games with 31-plus points during that stretch . The Rockets\u2019 sterling 31-1 mark with Harden, Chris Paul and Clint Capela in the lineup this season remains the most remarkable run by any trio in the league. It\u2019s also something the Rockets will draw on as they transition from the regular season to the postseason. Any notion that Harden and the Rockets will ease up as the regular season comes to a close is fool\u2019s gold. Harden believes \u201cthis is the year\u201d for Houston and that means leaving nothing to chance. He wants that No. 1 seed, the Kia MVP and everything else. He\u2019s playing like a man who wants it all. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.7 points, 9.0 assists, 8.4 rebounds LeBron\u2019s week was already spectacular, what with him becoming the first player in NBA history to pile up 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists . That milestone (one of the many LeBron has reached this season) comes on the heels of the first month of his career in which he averaged a triple-double ( 27 points, 10.5 assists and 10.5 rebounds per game in February ). Not bad for an elder statesman doing his best to hold off a crowd of younger stars challenging for his crown as the best player in the game. LeBron\u2019s 30 points in Thursday night\u2019s loss to Philadelphia was his 927th career game scoring 20 or more points \u2014 milestone alert! \u2014 moving him ahead of Michael Jordan for fourth place in that statistical feat. Only Karl Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kobe Bryant have more career 20-plus point scoring games. Perhaps most important, though, is the scoring surge (29 points per game) LeBron has produced since Cleveland general manager Koby Altman reshaped the team at the trade deadline . Prior to Tuesday\u2019s win over Brooklyn \u2014 when George Hill finished with 26 points \u2014 no other player on the roster since the deadline had scored 20 or more points. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  26.0 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.4 assists For a guy who has washed his hands of the whole awards chase, Durant sure seems to be doing his reluctant best to keep his name in this season\u2019s MVP mix. Sure, he\u2019s already been a Kia MVP ( 2014 ) and he is the reigning Finals MVP , so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s chasing something he hasn\u2019t already achieved before. But his play since the All-Star break has been stellar: 26.5 points, 53.8 percent shooting and 57.8 percent shooting on 3-pointers in wins against the LA Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder, New York Knicks and Durant\u2019s hometown Washington Wizards. It\u2019s the sort of reset Warriors coach Steve Kerr had to be hoping for coming out of the break. The Warriors have a fight on their hands for No. 1 in the West from the Houston Rockets. It\u2019s the first time since they\u2019ve ascended to the top of the Western Conference heap that they\u2019ve had to deal with this sort of challenger (no offense to the Spurs). Having a motivated and focused Durant on his side has to provide Kerr some comfort for these finals weeks of the regular season. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  26.7 points, 6.4 assists, 5.3 rebounds During a week when the focus could have been abut everything other than basketball \u2014 the Warriors were making their lone visit to Washington, D.C. \u2014 Curry has kept his focus on the basketball business at hand. Rather than turning the trip into a week-long political statement, Curry and the Warriors are continuing the roll they have been on since the All-Star break. He\u2019s been locked, especially from 3-point range, knocking down 21 of his 41 shots from deep entering tonight\u2019s road game against the Atlanta Hawks ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). The beautiful thing about being a lights-out shooter like Curry is that even on a rare off night \u2014 he shot just 5-for-15 against the Wizards \u2014 you can save yourself at the free throw line (11-or-12). More important for Curry right now is that he stay healthy and continue to work on taking care of the ball (he had six turnovers against the Wizards). A battle for No. 1 in the West with Houston is making it impossible for Golden State to do what they\u2019ve done the past three seasons: cruise into the start of the playoffs. Last week:  Not ranked Season stats:  28.1 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.2 blocks Only the blockbuster film \u201cBlack Panther\u201d had a better month than Davis, who wrapped up February averaging 35 ppg, 13 rpg, 2.5 spg, 2.2 bpg and 1.5 apg . During the Pelicans\u2019 current seven-game win streak, Davis has been even better: 39.3 ppg, 15 rpg and 2.7 bpg on 53.5 percent shooting . There are only four other players, all Hall of Famers \u2014 Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Abdul-Jabbar and Moses Malone \u2014 in NBA history to average at least 35 points and 15 rebounds over a seven-game span. The Pelicans struggled in the immediate aftermath of Cousins\u2019 injury and lost five of six games. Then, Davis took off and the Pelicans cranked it up on this current streak. Not only has Davis inserted himself into the thick of the MVP chase, saving the season in New Orleans and perhaps the job of coach Alvin Gentry, the Pelicans are sitting in fifth place in the Western Conference standings . They have a legitimate shot at challenging for a top-four spot and the home-court advantage in the first round that comes along with it. 6. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 7. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 8. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 10. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers And five more: Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves An inside look at Andrew Wiggins from a Western Conference advance scout: \u201cHe\u2019s had a strange season, from month to month. He seemed totally locked in when I saw him early, energetic and motivated to prove to everyone that he was not going to take a step back for Jimmy Butler or anyone else on a revamped team. But it didn\u2019t last. And there came a time, in December, when he seemed to lose a little confidence as his shot went missing. And for young guys, even ones as talented as Wiggins, when they aren\u2019t making shots they tend to go into a funk. He battled out of it but seemed to slip a little last month. His consistency has just not been there this season. He looks like a completely different player from night to night, which really changed from last season, when I felt like he was one of the young guys who was really on the rise. \u201cHe was on the attack, especially when it seemed like he had an opportunity to measure himself against an established veteran star. I honestly don\u2019t understand it, what\u2019s happened to him, other than the transition with Jimmy coming in and taking that alpha role was tougher for him than expected. I hate to say it, because you never like to see anyone suffer through a serious injury, but Jimmy going down with that knee injury gives him a clear path to get back in a groove. \u201cThe Timberwolves need him to do it, they are in a fight for that top four spot in the standings, and Wiggins probably needs it for his own psyche. He missed out on being an All-Star this season, which I think broke his spirit. I really do. He has a chance now to prove that he belongs in that group, that his game has matured and that he\u2019s capable of stepping up when the Timberwolves need him most. Whatever the timetable is for Jimmy\u2019s return, the Timberwolves need him to shake out of it and get back to playing at a high level, because he\u2019s better than what I\u2019ve seen from him overall this season. He\u2019s been average at best, and he\u2019s better than that. He\u2019s a better player and certainly a better talent than what he\u2019s shown this season.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Much of that comes from the fact Paul Millsap logged his first minutes in 44 games, returning from the left wrist injury that sidelined him for three months.

Just days after three billboards, paid for by a Pennsylvania company, popped up in Ohio urging James to sign with the 76ers this summer as a free agent, the three-time NBA champion reportedly was spotted in the Philadelphia area over the All-Star break touring area high schools. Sixers TV game analyst Alaa Abdelnaby said he was told that James, who has three kids, looked at private schools in Philadelphia last month. \u201cI\u2019ve told this to a few other people, and I have no problem saying this,\u201d Abdelnaby said on Philly Sports Talk. \u201cMy brother lives in the Philadelphia area and he told me that LeBron, last week through a superintendent, was in the area checking out some private schools during the All-Star break.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s shootaround before the Cavs hosted the Sixers, James was asked if he was in Philadelphia. \u201cPennsylvania? Nah,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Over the All-Star break, I was on vacation and then went to Los Angeles.\u201d Following the group interview session, James was still wondering why he was asked about being in Philadelphia a few weeks ago. Told that it was because of reports that he was spotted there, James grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said. During the All-Star break, James took his family on a quick getaway to Mexico before playing in his 14th All-Star game. He was named MVP for the third time as a team of players he picked beat a team captained by Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry. The 33-year-old James said this week that he was flattered Sixers fans are covet him. He can opt out of his contract this summer \u2013 he has a $35.6 option \u2013 with Cleveland and become a free agent. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering. But people in their respective city want me to play for them. That\u2019s cool I think.\u201d The NBA prohibits teams from recruiting potential players. But there\u2019s nothing to impede fans from wooing James, and that will likely intensify as the offseason nears. With a young roster featuring center Joel Embiid and do-it-all forward Ben Simmons, Philadelphia could be an attractive landing spot for James, who famously left Cleveland in 2010 and signed with the Miami Heat. James already has a bond with the Australian-born Simmons, who is represented by Rich Paul, one of James\u2019 closest friends and business partners."},{"id":47472,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-jr-smith-suspended-one-game-official-release","date":"2018-03-01","title":"Cleveland Cavaliers' J.R.

He\u2019s four months away from free agency, the wheeling-and-dealing period where \u2013 the way things were looking a year ago \u2013 he would be signing a contract worth well over $100 million ensuring himself a level of wealth that would be well beyond what the player picked last in the 2011 NBA draft should have reasonably expected. Nothing is certain now. * Powell:  Bumpy offseason could await Thomas He\u2019s gone from a star in Boston to being cast aside in Cleveland and now finds himself as a backup with the Los Angeles Lakers, still trying to get healthy after hip surgery. If that wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s the added strain that what he does over these next few high-stakes weeks will go a long way in determining what he\u2019ll earn and where he\u2019ll play over the next few years. \u201cAll you need is one team to love you,\u201d Thomas said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s like the draft all over again. You just need one team.\u201d He averaged just under 29 points per game last season. He hasn\u2019t scored more than 24 in any game this season, couldn\u2019t get on the floor until January while recovering from the hip surgery and lasted only 15 games with the Cavaliers before getting traded to the Lakers in early February. Thomas was the main piece that Cleveland got from Boston in the deal that sent Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, and his on-court Cavs tenure lasted roughly one month. The Lakers want Thomas to mentor their young players, and they\u2019re giving him rest and recovery time when he needs \u2013 mindful that he wants to go into this summer as healthy as possible. \u201cI think he\u2019s been judged pretty harshly with the fact that he missed that much time,\u201d Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing good for us. I think with the more time he has just playing basketball, the better he\u2019ll get as far as getting back to doing the things he was doing in Boston last season.\u201d Walton speaks highly of Thomas, which suggests that the Lakers could be that one team Thomas is looking for. In 21 games entering Thursday, Thomas is averaged 14.3 points in 26 minutes. He\u2019s shooting 37 percent, almost 10 percent down from where he was a year ago. \u201cIf they give me a bigger opportunity, I\u2019m capable of bringing more to the table,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cUntil then I\u2019m doing what I can. I\u2019m getting as healthy as I possibly can. Every day I\u2019m feeling a lot better. I\u2019m just grinding it out and just trying to be ready for any opportunities that come my way.\u201d Thomas went through pain of the emotional and physical kind with the Celtics a year ago, after his sister died in a car crash just before the start of Boston\u2019s postseason run. About three weeks later, on the day Chyna Thomas would have turned 23, her brother \u2013 a day removed from oral surgery \u2013 scored 53 points to lead the Celtics past Washington. Not long after that, the Celtics shut the 5-foot-9 guard down because of the right hip problem. \u201cHim being a competitor and a warrior, he made his injury even worse instead of putting his stock up there and saying `I\u2019m done, let me get ready for the next season so I can get a max deal,\u201d\u2018 said Miami guard Dwyane Wade, a Thomas teammate in Cleveland this season. \u201cHe kept trying to fight and fight and fight for the city that he was playing for. So it\u2019s a tough situation. \u201cOne thing I know about him, you don\u2019t become a household name at 5-foot-whatever-he-is without having grit, without having toughness and without knowing you can overcome anything.\u201d That\u2019s the belief Thomas still has these days. He doesn\u2019t think he can merely return to the level he was at last year. He thinks he can get even better. The challenge will be making someone else believe that this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s `what have you done for me lately.\u2019 That\u2019s the league we\u2019re in and I understand that,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m given the same opportunity I was given in Boston, I would do the same thing. And that\u2019s just what it is. My resume speaks for itself. What I can do on the basketball floor speaks for itself.

James averaged a triple-double in a calendar month for the first time in his 15-year career, leading the Eastern Conference in scoring (27.0 ppg) and assists (10.5 apg) and adding 10.5 rebounds in 10 games. The 6-8 forward, who tied for the league lead with four triple-doubles, shot 54.6 percent from the field and 41.9 percent from three-point range and finished second in the conference in minutes (37.3 mpg). He helped the Cavaliers post a 6-4 record in February. On Feb. 27, James recorded 31 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 129-123 home victory over the Brooklyn Nets. With that performance, the 33-year-old James became the first player in NBA history to accumulate 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists. Davis averaged 35.0 points (first in the NBA), 13.0 rebounds (third), 2.45 steals (second) and 2.18 blocked shots (second) in 11 games, making him the first player in league history to hit these marks for a calendar month since steals and blocks became official statistics in 1973-74. His scoring average was a personal best for a month in which he appeared in at least five games. Behind Davis, the Pelicans went 8-3 in February and closed the month on a seven-game winning streak, moving into a tie for fifth place in the Western Conference. In a 124-123 overtime victory against the Miami Heat on Feb. 23, the 6-10 forward became the first player ever to produce at least 40 points, 15 rebounds, five steals and five blocks in a game since steals and blocks were first recorded (45\/17\/5\/5).  Here are additional highlights for James and Davis in February: Feb. 7 vs. Minnesota: Made the game-winning shot and posted 37 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in a 140-138 overtime win over the Timberwolves. Feb. 9 @ Atlanta: Dished out a career-best 19 assists and added 22 points and 12 rebounds in a 123-107 win over the Hawks. Feb. 13 @ Oklahoma City: Scored 37 points and added eight rebounds and eight assists in a 120-112 victory against the Thunder. Feb. 10 @ Brooklyn: Finished with 44 points, 17 rebounds and a career-high six steals in a 138-128 double-overtime victory against the Nets.

Simmons won the Kia NBA Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month award for the second consecutive month and the third time this season. In February, he led East rookies in scoring (16.0 ppg) and rebounding (7.3 rpg) and paced all first-year NBA players in assists (7.7 apg). He also tied for the rookie lead in steals (2.00 spg) and ranked third among that group in field goal percentage (55.0). The 6-10 guard\/forward from Australia helped the 76ers to an 8-3 record for the month, the second-best mark in the East. On Feb. 14, Simmons had a triple-double of 18 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists as the 76ers rallied from a 24-point third-quarter deficit to defeat the Miami Heat 104-102 in Philadelphia. In his first game after the All-Star break, Simmons scored a career-high 32 points, made the go-ahead free throw with 5.6 seconds left and added 11 assists and seven rebounds in a 116-115 road win against the Chicago Bulls on Feb. 22. Mitchell earned the Kia NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month award for the third month in a row. In February, he averaged a rookie-high 21.4 points to go with 4.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.30 steals in 10 games as Utah went 8-2 with him in the lineup and 9-2 overall. He topped all first-year NBA players with 29 three-pointers made and led West rookies with 29 free throws made. The 6-3 guard opened the month by scoring 40 points on 14-of-19 shooting from the field (including 7-of-9 from three-point range) in a 129-97 road win over the Phoenix Suns on Feb. 2. With that performance, Mitchell became the first player in Jazz history with multiple 40-point games in his rookie season. He scored at least 24 points in each of his final four games before the All-Star break \u2013 all Utah victories. Here are additional highlights for Simmons and Mitchell in February: Feb. 2 vs. Miami: Recorded 20 points, six rebounds and five assists in a 103-97 win over the Heat. Feb. 6 vs. Washington: Shot 6-of-8 from the field and posted 15 points, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals in a 115-102 victory against the Wizards. Feb. 12 vs. New York : Contributed 13 points, six rebounds, six assists, four steals and three blocks in a 108-92 victory over the Knicks. Feb. 11 @ Portland: Scored 27 points and grabbed six rebounds in a 115-96 win over the Trail Blazers. Feb. 12 vs. San Antonio: Finished with 25 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals in a 101-99 victory over the Spurs.

Just days after three billboards , paid for by a Pennsylvania company, popped up in Ohio urging James to sign with the 76ers this summer as a free agent, the three-time NBA champion reportedly was spotted in the Philadelphia area over the All-Star break touring area high schools. Sixers TV game analyst Alaa Abdelnaby said he was told that James, who has three kids, looked at private schools in Philadelphia last month. \u201cI\u2019ve told this to a few other people, and I have no problem saying this,\u201d Abdelnaby said on Philly Sports Talk. \u201cMy brother lives in the Philadelphia area and he told me that LeBron, last week through a superintendent, was in the area checking out some private schools during the All-Star break.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s shootaround before the Cavs hosted the Sixers, James was asked if he was in Philadelphia. \u201cPennsylvania? Nah,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Over the All-Star break, I was on vacation and then went to Los Angeles.\u201d Following the group interview session, James was still wondering why he was asked about being in Philadelphia a few weeks ago. Told that it was because of reports that he was spotted there, James grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said. During the All-Star break, James took his family on a quick getaway to Mexico before playing in his 14th All-Star game. He was named MVP for the third time as a team of players he picked beat a team captained by Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry. The 33-year-old James said this week that he was flattered Sixers fans are covet him. He can opt out of his contract this summer \u2013 he has a $35.6 option \u2013 with Cleveland and become a free agent. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering. But people in their respective city want me to play for them. That\u2019s cool I think. That\u2019s dope.\u201d The NBA prohibits teams from recruiting potential players. But there\u2019s nothing to impede fans from wooing James, and that will likely intensify as the offseason nears. With a young roster featuring center Joel Embiid and do-it-all forward Ben Simmons, Philadelphia could be an attractive landing spot for James, who famously left Cleveland in 2010 and signed with the Miami Heat. James already has a bond with Simmons, who is represented by Rich Paul, one of James\u2019 closest friends and business partners."},{"id":41565,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/playoff-race-breakdown-east-teams-4-8","date":"2018-03-01","title":"Playoff race breakdown: Next week critical for seeds No. 4-8 in Eastern Conference","content":" The Eastern Conference is having its third best season of the last 19 years. It has a losing record vs. the Western Conference for the 19th time in those 19 seasons, but at 163-185 against the West through Wednesday\u2019s games, the East has been relatively competitive in a season in which we thought it might be historically bad. Let\u2019s remember that last summer, the East lost four 2017 All-Stars \u2014 Carmelo Anthony, Jimmy Butler, Paul George and Paul Millsap \u2014 to the Western Conference. The only \u201917 All-Star that went in the other direction \u2014 Gordon Hayward \u2013 has played five minutes this season. While the Cleveland Cavaliers have taken a step backward, other East teams have improved. The Philadelphia 76ers have had the league\u2019s second biggest jump in winning percentage and its biggest jump in point differential per 100 possessions . The Indiana Pacers, meanwhile, have been the East\u2019s biggest surprise and, despite the loss of George, are on pace to win more games than they did last season. Amazingly, those two teams are in the mix for a top-four seed in the East. And they\u2019re joined by the Washington Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat in a scrum for seeds No. 4-8 , five teams within three games in the loss column. The East playoffs could be a lot more interesting than they were last season, but there\u2019s still a lot to be determined between now and April 14 (the first day of the playoffs). And with a lot of head-to-head matchups between teams 4-8 in the next six days, it\u2019s a good time to see where they stand and what lies ahead. Of course, the Cavs are far from clinching the No. 3 seed. They have the same number of wins (36) as the fourth-place Wizards, they haven\u2019t figured out their defensive issues since making big changes to their roster at the deadline, and they have the sixth best point differential in the East . But, rather than spread this conversation too thin, we\u2019ll focus on Washington, Indiana, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Miami with the understanding that those four teams aren\u2019t necessarily locked into seeds No. 4-8. None of those five teams have a discrepancy between their record and their point differential quite as big as the Cavs (36-24 with a point differential of a 31-29 team). But the Bucks and Heat both have inflated records when comparing them with their point differential. Milwaukee is 33-28 and Miami is 32-29. But both teams have been outscored this season and each has point differential of a team that\u2019s 29-32. The Sixers are on the other side of the spectrum, in sixth place with the conference\u2019s third best per-game point differential (that of a team with two more wins than they actually have). If you take their records (the games they\u2019ve won so far) and use their point differentials to project how they\u2019ll do over the final six weeks of the season (ignoring strength of schedule), these five teams would stay in the order they\u2019re in \u2014 with the following records: Using the same methodology, Cleveland would finish 47-35, tied with Washington for third place in the East. The Cavs lead the season series, 2-1 , with one more game (April 5) in Cleveland. Of these five teams, the Sixers had the best February, going 8-3 and outscoring their opponents by 5.6 points per 100 possessions, the league\u2019s fifth best mark last month . And that was with eight of their 11 February games coming against teams that currently have winning records. Since Jan. 1, the Sixers are *10-6 in games against the other 17 teams that are currently over .500, and those 10 \u201cquality\u201d wins are more than every other team except Houston (13-3) and Golden State (12-6) over these last two months. Philadelphia also ranks second defensively since Jan. 1 . * If you\u2019ve been wondering why the Sixers have been ranked so high in the Power Rankings the last few weeks, this is the biggest reason. The Wizards are 10-4 since losing John Wall to a knee injury , with the league\u2019s seventh best offense (and its highest assist rate ) over that stretch. Six of the 10 wins \u2013 including victories over the Pacers, Sixers and Bucks \u2013 have been against teams with winning records. So the Sixers and Wizards enter March with some momentum. For the others, last few weeks have been a mixed bag. The Pacers won nine of their last 12 games before the All-Star break , and their win in Boston on Feb. 9 was one of their best wins of the season. But Indiana ended February with losses to two of the worst teams in the league, losing in Dallas on Monday and in Atlanta on Wednesday . And now (see below), their schedule is going to get much tougher. Milwaukee started 10-3 under interim coach Joe Prunty , and that stretch concluded with a win in Toronto. But it was mostly against a soft schedule, and the Bucks have now lost three straight games , dropping to 2-6 under Prunty against teams that still have playoff hopes (no worse than Detroit). The Heat had the roughest February of the group and lost eight of nine games between Jan. 31 and Feb. 23 . But those eight losses were by a total of just 28 points and they\u2019ve now won two straight, finishing the month with an important win over the Sixers. The Pacers have the toughest remaining schedule in the East in regard to opponent strength, with 16 of their 21 games against teams that are currently over .500. They have won six of their last 10 against that group, with road wins in Utah (before the Jazz\u2019s 11-game winning streak), San Antonio and Boston over the last month before the break. The Wizards have the East\u2019s third toughest remaining schedule in regard to opponent strength and have five remaining games where they\u2019ll be at a *disadvantage in regard to rest. But among East teams, only Miami (8) has fewer road games than the Wizards (9). * They\u2019ll be playing the second game of a back-to-back against an opponent that didn\u2019t play the day before. Over the last two seasons, home teams are 285-154 (.649) with a rest advantage and road teams are 83-81 (.506) with a rest advantage. The Bucks are in the middle of the pack in the East in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage (.491) over their remaining schedule. They have a league-high six remaining games with a rest advantage and are 5-2 in rest-advantage games so far this season. One of those remaining ones is the last game of the season in Philadelphia. The Heat have the East\u2019s third easiest schedule in regard to opponent strength, with more games remaining against the 12 teams with losing records (11) than they do against the 18 teams with winning records (10). They also have the East\u2019s most home-heavy remaining schedule, with 13 of their 21 games at AmericanAirlines Arena, though home vs. road hasn\u2019t made a huge difference for them (see below). The Sixers have the league\u2019s easiest remaining schedule in regard to opponent strength, with seven more games against teams with losing records (15) than against teams with winning records (8). The next biggest discrepancy in that direction is just three (Chicago: 9 and 12). The 23 games the Sixers have left are the most for any team in the league. So they have five back-to-backs left on their schedule. But only one of their 23 games is against a team that currently ranks in the top 10 defensively . They have a league-high 11 games remaining against bottom-10 defenses . So the remaining schedule favors Miami and Philadelphia. Three of the 10 season series between these five teams are complete. Two of them \u2014 Milwaukee vs. Washington and Philadelphia vs. Washington \u2014 ended in 2-2 ties, and the only head-to-head tiebreaker that we know right now is Miami over Milwaukee, with the Heat having swept the season series, 3-0 . So there\u2019s still a lot to be determined in terms of tiebreakers within this group. But we will have at least two more definitive head-to-head winners ( Indiana vs. Philadelphia and Indiana vs. Washington ), because those are three-game season series. We\u2019ll know both of those by March 17. Here are the remaining head-to-head games between these five teams, including five in the first six days in March\u2026 (RA) \u2013 Rest advantage If there\u2019s a tie between more than two teams, the first tiebreaker is division winner vs. non-division winner. That\u2019s also the next tiebreaker in a two-way tie where the teams split the season series. So Washington has an edge in that regard , though winning their division isn\u2019t yet out of the question for Indiana or Miami. The Pacers would probably have a division-record edge over the Bucks if they split their season series, and the same goes for the Heat over the Wizards. Conference record is the next tiebreaker for teams that aren\u2019t in the same division, putting Milwaukee in a tough spot. If we assume that these five teams will finish No. 4-8 in the East, two of them will play each other, while the other three will get the Raptors, Celtics and Cavs in the first round. It\u2019s worth noting that LeBron James\u2019 teams have swept their last five first-round series. It\u2019s also worth noting that head-to-head record in the regular season doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything in the playoffs. Also, as noted last week , being a great home team in the regular season doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to home dominance in the postseason. Still, while the Sixers are 6-5 against the other four teams in this group, they\u2019re 2-8 against Toronto ( 1-3 ), Boston ( 1-3 ) and Cleveland ( 0-2 ). They might benefit most from finishing fourth of fifth. The Pacers are the only of the five teams currently seeded 4-8 that has a winning record vs. the top three. They\u2019re 1-1 vs. Toronto , 1-2 vs. Boston and 3-1 vs. Cleveland . The Wizards are 2-1 vs. Toronto , and the Heat are 2-1 vs. Boston . At 21-11 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the Pacers have been the best home team within the group . The Wizards are the only one of the five with a winning record (18-14) on the road . The Heat have been only 0.3 points per 100 possessions better at home (minus-0.5) than on the road (minus-0.8) . Eighteen of their last 19 games have been within five points in the last five minutes, and it doesn\u2019t seem to matter where they play or who they\u2019re playing. The Sixers have been 7.9 points per 100 possessions better at home (plus-6.5) than on the road (minus-1.4) . That\u2019s the fourth biggest home-road NetRtg differential in the league, trailing only the marks of Denver, New York and Detroit. Philly is 12-0 at the Wells Fargo Center in 2018 (their Jan. 11 \u201chome\u201d loss to Boston took place in London). The Sixers, trending in the right direction and with an easy remaining schedule, have a shot at that 4 seed. It would be a great story given their last five years, and it would mean a lot in regard to their chances of advancing to the conference semifinals. They still have to figure out how to win in the road, where they\u2019ve lost six of their last seven . And that easy remaining schedule begins with a visit to Cleveland on Thursday ( 8 p.m. ET, TNT ). * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. Ilyasova appeared in 46 games (40 starts) with Atlanta this season, averaging 10.9 points and 5.5 rebounds in 25.6 minutes per game, while shooting .459 from the field and .359 from three-point range. He has scored in double figures 23 times this season and has nine 20-point performances. Ilyasova is also fourth in the NBA in charges drawn with 22 after leading the league with 36 in 2016-17. A native of Turkey, Ilyasova returns to Philadelphia where he played 53 games (40 starts) with the 76ers in 2016-17 after being acquired in a trade with Oklahoma City on Nov. 1, 2016. Ilyasova scored in double figures in 46 games with Philadelphia, scoring at least 20 points in 12 contests. He also posted a season-high 17 rebounds against Memphis on Dec. 6, 2016. Philadelphia later traded Ilyasova on Feb. 22, 2017 to Atlanta in exchange for Tiago Splitter and a 2017 second-round pick (forward-center Mathias Lessort). Ilyasova finished the 2016-17 season with a career-high 142 made three-pointers, including 107 with the 76ers. Ilyasova\u2019s previous high for a season was 96 in 2015-16. In his 10th NBA season, Ilyasova has played in 655 games (405 starts) with Atlanta, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Detroit and Milwaukee. He holds career averages of 11.0 points and 5.9 rebounds in 24.5 minutes per game. He is a lifetime .366 three-point shooter and was among the top five in the NBA in three-point percentage in back-to-back seasons, finishing tied for second in 2011-12 (.455) and fourth in 2012-13 (.444). Ilyasova has shot above .400 from field-goal range in eight of his nine seasons in the league.  The 6-foot-10 forward was originally selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 36th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Ilyasova will wear No. 23 for the 76ers. Philadelphia now has seven international players on its roster, which is the second-most in the NBA behind the Utah Jazz with eight.

The game between the Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets on Jan. 19 may not have been ranked very high on many lists, but for the three men scheduled to officiate the game, it was a dream scenario. \u201cWhen we first got the schedule and saw it, we were like \u2018Alright, this is too good to be true,\u2019 \u201d said veteran official Bennie Adams, the crew chief for the game. \u201cWhen you get your schedule and you see that, you just kind of have a reaction, your eyes kind of get big, to have that opportunity in front of us,\u201d said second-year official C.J. Washington. What made the game so special for Adams, Washington and Courtney Kirkland was that for the first time in league history, an NBA game would be officiated by three referees that all graduated from the same school. That school was Southern University in Baton Rouge, La. \u2014 one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities that have produced nine of the league\u2019s 65 officials this season. In the weeks leading up to the game, the three Southern alums did not discuss their excitement for the moment. They didn\u2019t want to jinx the opportunity. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it, we didn\u2019t say anything prior to, leading up, because you have schedule changes and so much stuff that can happen,\u201d Washington said. \u201cYou just keep your fingers crossed that it\u2019s going to happen. And when we got to that moment, it was great.\u201d The three men arrived in Denver and held their regular morning meeting to address the business of the day. But once those tasks were complete, it was time to reminisce. Over lunch, they told stories of their separate, but similar, paths to the NBA. \u201cWe spent the lunch talking about each of our paths to get to being at that lunch table,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHow they all interconnected and all of the different people that helped us.\u201d Adams is in his 23rd season as an NBA official after earning both his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in mathematics at Southern. He taught math at Southern for two semesters (while also refereeing) and eventually followed his passion for refereeing over his initial goal of earning a his PhD and becoming a college professor. However, his passion for teaching was not lost, but merely redirected. He serves as a mentor to numerous NBA officials, most notably to Kirkland and Washington. Kirkland and Washington both cite Adams\u2019 tough-love approach to that mentoring role. \u201cBennie basically told me that I had to be better than everybody else, because essentially I was trading on his name,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cSo if his name was going to be involved in the situation, I had to be that good.\u201d Kirkland tells the story of a study session between he and Adams with Adams quizzing Kirkland on the rulebook. After providing an answer many would deem acceptable, Adams challenged Kirkland to provide the rule verbatim. As frustrating as this was for Kirkland, he understood the lesson Adams was teaching him.  \u201cBasically he told me \u2018Being good enough is not good enough; you\u2019ve got to be that much better.\u2019 And that resonated with me early in my career and I\u2019ve used that throughout the course of my career,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the league for 18 years now and I still remember those times where Bennie would constantly challenge me.\u201d \u201cHe gives tough love, that\u2019s just how Bennie is,\u201d Washington added. \u201cI went through years where I was questioning, \u2018Man does this guy even like me?\u2019 because he would always just be on you and on you and it seemed like more than he was on anybody else. But he was just trying to get everything out of you in terms of your ability, your potential, and he just wanted to see you at your very best every time he saw you.\u201d Adams laughed when he heard these stories of his approach. \u201cIt\u2019s an open and honest relationship so its tough love,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that was passed down to me, just having attended an HBCU. What I thought was okay really wasn\u2019t enough to be successful in the real world. But at the time I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. So that tough love was just pushing them to do better, to do more because they had it in them. I\u2019m only asking you to do things that I know you can do even if you don\u2019t know you can do them yet. And do them at a level of excellence that when they make the decision on you it\u2019s without question.\u201d Adams says mentors Dr. Rogers Newman (in mathematics) and Aaron Wade (in refereeing) instilled the high expectations in him that he now expects of others. Adams calls Newman the most intelligent person he\u2019s seen in his entire life and saw him as a bar to strive for. \u201cI would be in class and I was like, I wish I could do anything in life as well as he can do this. It was just inspiring. I can\u2019t even explain how brilliant he was and how that impacted me,\u201d Adams said. \u201cEverything I thought I was doing \u2014 and I thought I was smart \u2014 I realized I didn\u2019t know anything compared to him and that I had so much more to learn and so much room to grow and that transferred into my refereeing.\u201d Kirkland is in his 18th season as an NBA official and spent time at Southern with both Adams (who was teaching while Kirkland was a student) and Washington (who was a freshman when Kirkland was a senior), bridging the gap between these three generations of officials. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty interesting that I was in between the two of them but I was able to meet both of them before they got their career started and both of them watched me as I got my career started as well,\u201d he said. Kirkland\u2019s road to the NBA began in 1994 as a high school official for the Baton Rouge Basketball Officials Association. Despite being named Rookie Official of the Year that year, Kirkland said it never dawned in him in those days that he could pursue refereeing as a career.  That would soon change as mutual contacts put Kirkland in touch with Adams, which began their mentoring relationship. A work stoppage with NBA officials the following year provided a unique opportunity. With NBA officials locked out, Continental Basketball Association officials refereed NBA games. That left openings in the CBA and Kirkland\u2019s name popped up to fill an open CBA officiating spot. \u201cNow I didn\u2019t know anything about refereeing pro basketball but that was when I met Aaron Wade, who at the time was overseeing the CBA,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cHe called me and he said \u2018I heard you were a pretty good referee, are you interested in working in the CBA?\u2019 \u201cAgain I had no idea what I was doing, no clue, no nothing, but I said \u2018Sure I\u2019m interested.\u2019 I\u2019d had some conversations with Bennie. He had sent me some videotapes. He said look over the videotapes, here\u2019s some rulebooks, read them and be ready to go. And I said \u2018Okay.\u2019 And I looked at the videotapes, I studied them like it was the bible. I read the rulebooks like they were the bible and I also went on to do a couple of CBA games.\u201d The labor dispute ended and Kirkland only refereed a few CBA games, but that experience left a strong impression on him. \u201cOnce I got that little taste that\u2019s when I realized this is something I could do long term,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I really got the bug of trying to do this professionally. And then I basically just ran a race from there. \u201cI got myself engaged with the Southeastern Conference and their training program so while I was doing that, Darell Garretson was actually the supervisor for the NBA. So Darell got the chance to look at me at a college camp and with the SEC, that was kind of a springboard for my career.\u201d Kirkland would earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from Southern in 1999 and was hired by the NBA in 2000. It was in his final year at Southern that Kirkland met Washington, even though it wasn\u2019t in a refereeing capacity just yet. \u201cRefereeing was never part of the conversation at that point in his life,\u201d Kirkland said of Washington. \u201cHe was still relatively new at Southern. It wasn\u2019t until later on, where I had already graduated and kind of gone on with my life and started with basketball that he actually got involved in refereeing. Then to go and see him again and be like \u2018Wow I remember you; now you\u2019re doing this!\u2019 \u201cI helped train C.J. for many years when he moved to Texas. I used to do a training camp down in Lake Charles, Louisiana. C.J. was one of the campers that I helped to train there and then when he got involved with the SWAC conference, I helped train him there as well. I\u2019ve known C.J. for years so that was a great experience.\u201d By the time Washington began refereeing high school basketball in 2002, Adams and Kirkland were already in the NBA. But the efforts to bring along the next generation of officials from Southern kept Adams and Kirkland involved with Washington\u2019s development. Washington graduated from Southern in 2002 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mass communications. After spending a year as a high school referee and real estate appraiser, Washington pursued full-time refereeing, beginning a 14-year journey to the NBA. \u201cWhen I became an official, of course I heard all these names of people that came before me and so of course Bennie and Courtney were two of the names,\u201d Washington said. \u201cSo when I got a chance to meet them a few years later we automatically had this sort of a bond because they wanted to see me be successful being that I was from Southern and kind of started in the same area and the same way that they did. So that\u2019s a pretty cool bond that we have.\u201d Washington\u2019s journey went from high schools to the SWAC, SEC, Conference USA and Southland Conference. Then came the G League, where he spent eight years before being hired by the NBA last season. Washington was able to put everything in perspective once his goal of being an NBA referee was realized. \u201cI will never forget it when I finally made it to the NBA, even before I got hired, when I was there as a part-time referee and was on the radar to get hired, and then getting hired, Bennie was one of the first people to reach out,\u201d Washington said. \u201cAnd he had the biggest smile on his face and he just said \u2018Man, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u2019 \u201d  \u201cEverybody has taken pride in passing it down and trying to reach back and bring the next person along with C.J. being the latest person,\u201d Adams said. \u201cAnd a couple other people who aren\u2019t in the NBA have had very successful collegiate careers, having worked multiple Final Fours \u2014 all coming out of that same [high school] association and through our same network. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re really, really proud of because it\u2019s like \u2018Do you want to be the one and only or the first of many?\u2019 That\u2019s what it\u2019s really about. If I get in and it\u2019s just me and nobody else comes along then I haven\u2019t really done anything. But when you can be the first of many to come and that\u2019s an attainable dream for people behind you, it\u2019s really humbling and you take pride in your responsibility of it.\u201d When it comes to pride, few nights will stood out more than that Jan. 19 in Denver as Adams, Kirkland and Washington worked their first game together. The trio had NBA photographer Garrett Elwood capture the moment on film before the game. But then there was work to do. \u201cThere was anxiety of the three of us being able to enjoy the moment, but still having to take care of the work at hand,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t work the game well, then the moment is meaningless because you still have to go do the job. You don\u2019t want the moment tarnished. It was the beauty of having that challenge.\u201d \u201cIn the back our minds, we wanted to do well so that the moment would be something that we could always be remembered in a positive way and I think we did that,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWere we perfect? No, we weren\u2019t perfect, but we were pretty good. And we took care of the game and we walked off the court feeling good about ourselves and the work that we did and just proud of the way we were taught how to referee and how its translated to the NBA for all three of us.\u201d"},{"id":41562,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-corey-brewer-los-angeles-lakers-eyeing-buyout","date":"2018-02-28","title":"Report: Waived by Los Angeles Lakers, Corey Brewer likely to sign with Oklahoma City Thunder","content":" The Lakers have agreed to a contract buyout with veteran Corey Brewer and recalled big man Thomas Bryant from their G League affiliate on Wednesday.

What say you?  * * * David Aldridge :  I can\u2019t judge intent, though the optics of it were horrible. I am reminded, though, of what I would think after hearing a certain player (he\u2019s now on TV) had been involved in some kind of off-court incident: \u201cwhy is it, when the (bleep) goes down wrong, you\u2019re always there?\u201d Why are guys always limping after encountering Zaza? Yes, he\u2019s clumsy. But nothing in that exchange with Westbrook suggests a professional athlete, as Pachulia is, exercising any kind of restraint or control of his body, as he obviously has, or he wouldn\u2019t be a professional athlete. I have said and continue to believe that Matthew Dellavedova, if not a dirty player, is a careless one, who throws his body around not caring if it careens into someone else\u2019s at an odd angle and causes injury. I guess I\u2019d put Zaza in that same category. And just as the league ultimately penalized Draymond Green for continued groin contact whether he \u201cmeant\u201d to do it or not, it has to ultimately adjudicate Pachulia if this continues. Steve Aschburner : I say it\u2019s got to be hard to be Zaza.  In a league of ridiculously lithe and agile athletes, Pachulia is a plodder. A plowhorse trying to keep up with thoroughbreds. His rap sheet of shaky, punishing plays suggests malice, and yet the worst of his banging and thrashing was perpetrated last season on his own teammate, Kevin Durant ( and Zaza was mortified by it ). So did it look like he targeted his fall to land on Westbrook\u2019s legs? Yeah. But would that have been a lot to process in real time \u2014 Nick Young\u2019s foot catching Pachulia behind the knee, giving him an opportunity to try for a little mayhem \u2014 to have an alibi? Yeah. No one wants to be known as a dirty player. But it surely can\u2019t be fun, either, being known as an oaf or a lummox in a league full of gazelles. Cut Zaza some slack. Tas Melas :  Zaza Pachulia is an \u201copportunistic dirty player\u201d. Nick Young\u2019s foot on the back of his knee gave him enough reason to fall on Westbrook. He could have maintained his balance far better than he did, possibly even stayed on his feet, but when opportunity knocks, Zaza is there. He doesn\u2019t overtly go out of his way to hurt anyone, but someone giving him a nudge was enough of a justification to fall on an opponent, and if there\u2019s an injury which occurs because of it, so be it. Shaun Powell :  I say the evidence is in and Zaza Pachulia is \u2014 brace yourself, now \u2014 slow-footed and clumsy . And sometimes the clumsy players are the most dangerous, not only to the opposition, but to their own teammates. The replays clearly showed Zaza\u2019s leg buckling from a hit, causing him to lose balance. Maybe a more athletic player doesn\u2019t collapse. And sure, Zaza has been involved in questionable issues before this. But he\u2019s a big oaf, first and foremost. On this play, he was guilty of that. John Schuhmann :  I\u2019m not Zaza Pachulia, so I don\u2019t know. But Pachulia\u2019s reputation as an irritant doesn\u2019t help him when it comes to stuff like this.  Sekou Smith :  I think suggesting deliberate or \u201cdirty\u201d intent about Zaza is something that simply is not there. Those words imply a sinister intention or a dark side I\u2019ve never witnessed in the big fella. Is he, as Kevin Durant suggests, a bit clumsy ? I think so. That makes much more sense than Zaza being some dirty player bent on taking out opposing team\u2019s stars like Russell Westbrook on a regular basis. Yes, he plays a physical style and pushes it to the edge sometimes. Dirty, though, that\u2019s strong. I didn\u2019t think it was fair when Spurs coach Gregg Popovich tagged Zaza with that label after the Kawhi Leonard incident in the Western Conference finals last year. And I don\u2019t like it now. That\u2019s a serious charge, one that carries a heavy burden of proof, one I don\u2019t think Russ, Pop or anyone has established. * * *"},{"id":41560,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-can-minnesota-timberwolves-keep-no-4-seed-without-jimmy-butler","date":"2018-02-28","title":"Blogtable: Can Minnesota Timberwolves keep top-four seed without Jimmy Butler?","content":"* * * Can the Minnesota Timberwolves hang on to a top-four seed in the Western Conference without Jimmy Butler ?  * * * David Aldridge : It\u2019s going to be tough, especially if Kawhi Leonard is really coming back soon . The San Antonio Spurs are getting healthy at the right time of year. The Portland Trail Blazeds are coming on like a freight train, and the Oklahoma City Thunder have another big run left in them, I reckon. Minnesota\u2019s defense has just been so bad for so much of the season ( 24th in Defensive Rating ), and Butler was their best and most consistent defender by far. It will take a huge uptick at both ends of the floor from Andrew Wiggins \u2014 who is posting a career high in Defensive Win Shares at present, but will need to pick things up even more as the Wolves\u2019 top wing defender going forward. And the upcoming schedule is just brutal: at Portland (which has won 11 of 12 at home) on Thursday, followed by a roadie at Utah, then home for Boston and Golden State, then at red-hot Washington, at San Antonio, back home for Houston and the rugged Clippers. Steve Aschburner : Can they? Soitenly. Will they? Probably not. The race in the West is too close, with only 3 1\/2 games separating third place from lotteryland . Now, I\u2019ve seen Tom Thibodeau-coached teams do some impressive things with their best player sidelined (think Chicago Bulls, Derrick Rose and all those regular-season victories from 2012-15). But all it would take for the Wolves to slip into the bottom four of the West playoff seeds would be one, maybe two additional defeats due to Jimmy Butler\u2019s absence. Are you telling me Butler, at this rubber-legged point in the schedule, isn\u2019t worth one or two games over the final 18? The key for Minnesota is to slide no further than sixth. Starting a first-round series on the road is one thing, starting it on the road in Houston or Oakland is an entirely different beast. After their 14-year postseason drought, the Wolves need at least a legit gulp of the playoffs, not merely a sip. Tas Melas : That\u2019s a lot to ask in the loaded West, but luckily for them, they\u2019re tied for the most games played in the NBA. As my man John Schuhmann points out , the other four starters struggle defensively without Jimmy Butler. On the other hand, they only have four more games against top-10 offenses. 18 games remain \u2014 the front nine is harder than the back nine \u2014 maybe Jimmy can come back and save the round.  Shaun Powell :  I wasn\u2019t sure the Wolves\u2019 hold on the third seed was all that secure with Jimmy Butler. Now that he\u2019s on the shelf for roughly a month, this is a prime opportunity for Oklahoma City to finally right the ship, or the Spurs to regroup with Kawhi Leonard possibly returning. Who knows how the seeds from No. 3-8 will fall prior to the playoffs? Let\u2019s face it, every team staring up at Houston and Golden State brings imperfections. The Wolves just added another \u2026 at the absolute wrong time. John Schuhmann :  The Wolves have been fortunate to play their first two games since Butler\u2019s injury against the Bulls and Kings, but they now have eight straight against teams over .500 . Their offense can hold up without Butler, but their defense has been awful ( more than 114 points allowed per 100 possessions ) with him off the floor. The good news is that they have two more wins than any West team outside of Houston and Oakland . Also, every team in the mix for a top four seed, including the Wolves, has a tough schedule going forward, with at least twice as many games remaining against teams with winning records than against teams with losing records. The only team with much momentum \u2014 New Orleans \u2014 has four fewer wins in the bank than the Wolves do, so Minnesota has a good chance to hold on, but we\u2019ll know a lot more after seeing how they get through these next eight games. Sekou Smith :  The Timberwolves are going to find it extremely difficult to remain in that top four without Jimmy Butler leading the way. With no cushion to speak of in that logjam behind the Rockets and Warriors in the Western Conference playoff chase, I don\u2019t feel comfortable assuming anything about the final playoff positioning of the eight teams vying for those six spots. That said, this is a prime-time opportunity for Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins to assert themselves as leaders. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how these young stars handle themselves. We are about to find out if they are ready and are built for this moment. * * * "},{"id":41589,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-lebron-james-referee-complaints-planting-seed-postseason","date":"2018-02-28","title":"Blogtable: Is there anything behind LeBron James' complaints about referees?","content":"* * * LeBron James says NBA referees protect jump shooters more than drivers . Is James just planting a seed for the postseason, or is there something to this?  * * * David Aldridge :  There\u2019s some truth to what he said. But he\u2019s an imperfect messenger. The downsizing of the game, I think, makes it harder for refs to gauge whether contact on the driver is truly disruptive\/dislodging or just incidental. It\u2019s a lot easier to tell when a 7-footer swings down on a guard than when a 6-foot-8 guy goes full Hibbert on a 6-foot-6 guy. There\u2019s just so many more 3-pointers taken in a game now than drives, and guys like James Harden tried to take advantage of that in the last couple of years with the rip-through move, among others. Steve Aschburner : Everybody\u2019s always planting seeds when it comes to criticizing referees. Sometimes they merely have to do the work verbally, sometimes they have to fork over big bucks when sowing the so-and-so\u2019s. I haven\u2019t seen the numbers league-wide \u2014 perhaps John Schuhmann has crunched them for us \u2014 but relatively speaking, jump shooters probably are getting more protection than they used to. Remember, this is a sport that gave us the clich\u00e9 about \u201crefs rewarding aggressiveness\u201d and jump-shooting teams long have been seen as passive by comparison. I happen to think LeBron James suffers from the Shaq syndrome of being so big and strong that fouls against most players look like gnats on him. But I\u2019d also bet a significant sum that his FT attempts per game go up between now and whenever he\u2019s done playing this season. Tas Melas :  LeBron is right, there has been more of an emphasis by referees to let shooters land and not be affected while shooting, but that\u2019s just the cycle of officiating. The focus for the Referees\u2019 Association is always on something, it just so happens to currently be on the perimeter. I think LeBron is using the power of his voice, just like he did leading up to and during All-Star weekend . He is one of the toughest players to officiate in a game that is very difficult to officiate \u2014 sometimes the men and women with whistles just need to be reminded of that. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019ll give the referees more respect than that, to accuse them of selective enforcement, especially since there\u2019s no scientific data to support LeBron\u2019s claim. Perception can be different from reality. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to it and also don\u2019t suspect LeBron is planting a seed for the post-season. As an aside, why is LeBron\u2019s opinion on anything always weighed as gospel by the media and\/or public? No offense to him intended, but his voice doesn\u2019t necessarily represent the majority of the NBA. John Schuhmann :  Talk like that is always an attempt to plant a seed, but James\u2019 perspective is understandable, and given how big and strong he is, defenders probably get away with more contact against him than they do against other drivers. He\u2019s been fouled on 9.3 percent of his drives, the fifth highest rate among players who have averaged at least 10 drives per game , and maybe he should be higher on that list. Still, drives are much more difficult to officiate, because of the speed, the number of bodies involved in the action, and the potential for the offensive player to create an advantage with the contact that he makes. It\u2019s easier to determine if contact on the perimeter affects a jump shooter than if contact in the paint affects a driver. It\u2019s not necessarily the intent to protect one more than the other.  Sekou Smith :  This is definitely LeBron planting seeds. And haven\u2019t the referees been bashed enough already? I know they have issues they are trying to work through. But assigning calculated motives to them after each and every game goes above and beyond what\u2019s necessary right now. Protecting jump shooters at the expense of what? Come on, LeBron, you are better than that. I know he is just expressing himself, as is his prerogative. I just don\u2019t agree with his take on this one. You got smacked in the face on a drive against the Spurs and they missed the call. We get it. But enough already with the conspiracy theories. It\u2019s easily the most tired narrative in the league this season. And no one wins as long as we are discussing it."},{"id":41559,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/memphis-grizzlies-marc-gasol-losing-season-causing-some-frustration","date":"2018-02-28","title":"Marc Gasol expresses some of his frustration with season","content":" Not since his rookie season has Memphis Grizzlies star center Marc Gasol been on a team destined for less than 40 wins.

It makes you win games. Winning is what this is about,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about somebody playing well or getting, you know, your reps or developing players. Because we have a league for that. We have a league and a team here in Memphis to develop guys.

In celebration of Black History Month, we explore the unique bond that these officials have with one another and the impact that attending an HBCU had on their personal and professional lives. We continue our series with Tony Brown, who graduated from Clark Atlanta University in 1989. Brown is in his 16th season as an NBA referee and entered the 2017-18 season having officiated 894 regular-season games and 15 playoff games. Prior to joining the NBA, he worked for four seasons in the NBA G League and CBA and three seasons in the WNBA. Did you know that nine of the 65 NBA referees hailed from HBCUs? Brown: No I didn\u2019t. I knew there were a few but I didn\u2019t know there were nine. If you ask most of us, it\u2019s not enough. We still think the number is low (laughs). Now that I know there are more people that went to HBCUs on staff, I\u2019m going to have to clearly make sure they know that Clark Atlanta is absolutely the best one around. And they missed out by not attending Clark Atlanta University (laughs). Do you see any connective tissue as to why there are so many NBA referees that came through HBCUs? Brown: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any direct correlation to point to. I wish I had some method to the madness with it, but it\u2019s good to know. I didn\u2019t know there were that many. And I\u2019m even interested to find out the ones I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s funny because the HBCUs that the guys on our staff are from, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re within the same state in most cases. Except for Eric Lewis and me were both in Florida; he went to Bethume-Cookman and I started at Florida A&M before I ended up at Clark. I did know that C.J. [Washington], Courtney [Kirkland] and Bennie [Adams] all went to Southern. And Bennie has mentored all of us. Everybody that\u2019s come through coach [John] Guthrie\u2019s system through the SEC training program, Bennie Adams, Leroy Richardson and Tom Washington were primary mentors for a lot of us. HBCU Referees Series: S ean Corbin: Coppin State Karl Lane: Philander Smith College Derrick Stafford: Morehouse College Mentoring is such a strong theme when speaking with officials, how important is mentoring in this profession? Brown: It helps you avoid the pitfalls. Really it\u2019s a must for success because in this business you only grow by learning from your mistakes and your level of experience that you\u2019ve gained through the eyes of other people. You\u2019re not going to live long enough to make all the mistakes, but what helps you avoid that is getting proper direction when you get started. Even though the guys I just named they were my mentors and I know they mentored a lot of other guys because we came through the program, but that\u2019s also what we do on a daily basis with everyone on staff. We look out for one another as best as we can to try to make sure that they avoid the mistakes that we made along the way. That\u2019s where the growth comes in. What made you decide to attend an HBCU? Brown: Honestly, I went to an HBCU because of a basketball scholarship that I had to Florida A&M. I went there for basketball but I ended up leaving when the coach left. My choice was Clark Atlanta mainly because it was in Atlanta and I heard it was a good city for African-Americans to pursue success and my hope was to get a degree and then get a great job. When I got to Clark I ended up not playing basketball there because the program was in transition and then tuition was out of control. That\u2019s when my mom was like \u2018Are you crazy, you just left [A&M], where you were in the state of Florida and everything is working out.\u2019 But I went to Clark and took the chance. I ended up not playing but I still graduated on time and had a great time doing it. So it was a great life experience, and I understand the value of hard work by being there. What impact did attending an HBCU have on your life? Brown: It allowed me to see possibilities that I had not seen before. I grew up in Tallahassee, playing basketball all my younger years and Tallahassee is a very good college-orientated town, with a lot of diversity, which is great, but [going to Clark] afforded me something that I hadn\u2019t seen before. Then being in Atlanta and at the Atlanta University Center, I saw so many progressive, successful black people in so many different fields. The city itself is known for its political structure and it was governed mainly by black people, which made me pay attention to politics more, whereas I had not before attending Clark. So going to an HBCU changed my view of the world, it gave me a broader perspective. What was the best piece of advice someone gave you during college? Brown: My brother told me, especially as a student-athlete, he really wanted me to make sure that I took my education seriously and made it a priority over the athletics. It was emphasized that I should put as much into studying as I did basketball and that was great advice. They can never take the education away from you. It just gives you a sense of pride; this is something that you earned and it helped broaden your thinking. How was the transition from being a player to becoming an official? Brown: The biggest transition for me was trying to always not follow the ball. Because as a player the action is always on ball, and you have to get out of the mindset of looking at the game as a player, basically understanding and anticipating movements and trying to just be a student of the game. Officiating and being a player are both done on instinct, it\u2019s split second decisions. As a player you get out and you practice all of your moves way more than referees practice how they\u2019re going to call a foul. But the great thing that bridges referees and players within the game is the way we watch video and learn the ebbs and flows of the game, and the intricacies of the game, which helps us become better and that\u2019s what makes us great. How important is the celebration of Black History Month not only to you personally, but in society in general? Brown: It gives me such a sense of pride to see the nation embracing everyone\u2019s culture. The great thing for me when I look at African-American pioneers \u2013 mind you there were several African-American pioneers that really helped mold my thinking as a young adult and kid \u2013 but for me there was none more important than my parents, who guided me and shared the stories of others\u2019 greatness and willingness to lead the charge for change. I got to learn a little bit about all of them and they all achieved a special spot in my heart because they all had an impact, whether small or big, they impacted where we are today. It\u2019s going to continue to be a work in progress but it looks good."},{"id":41561,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/miami-heat-dwyane-wade-turns-back-clock-clutch-fourth-quarter-against-sixers","date":"2018-02-28","title":"Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade turns back clock with clutch fourth quarter against Sixers","content":"Dwyane Wade\u2019s best days are well behind him, to the point that he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll return next season for what would be his 16th NBA campaign.

That included writing Oliver\u2019s name on his shoes for Tuesday\u2019s game, followed by a vintage performance worthy of such a tribute.  Wade\u2019s onslaught began with a reverse layup to tie the game at 87 with 4:57 left in the fourth.

That act of basketball blasphemy is what\u2019s eating Isaiah Thomas, more than what happened in Cleveland and Boston and anything that might happen (or not) in L.A. A year ago this time, he was a Kia MVP favorite , punishing defenses with 3-pointers dropped from the heavens. He was hauling the Boston Celtics around on a 5-foot-9 frame, stealing hearts and plenty of games and, most assuredly, playing his way into his first financial jackpot. * Morning Tip Mailbag:  Who might pursue Thomas this summer? In 2016-17, he was averaging 28.9 points and pushed forward in the playoffs despite the pain of losing his sister . Thomas was a marvel to watch, to comprehend, to digest. A year ago. Not that long ago at all. Today, he is on his third team since then, a player renting a home and staring at an uncertain future. And none of this happened by his own doing. He did not screw things up, ask for or cause this. He is a victim of a series of unfortunate events and lousy timing. Can you compare his plight with that of any other All-NBA player and MVP candidate? Does any of this make sense? Is all of it unfair? How is it that Thomas, once the heartbeat of a No. 1 seed and title contender, is now splitting time with a rookie who doesn\u2019t shoot well? How is he spending this season\u2019s stretch run on a losing Los Angeles Lakers team that doesn\u2019t appear to have plans for him? This is the reality, and a strange one, for Thomas, who\u2019ll raise plenty of questions around the NBA when he hits free agency this summer. They will be questions no one imagined a year ago. The timeline, if you missed it: And here is Thomas, leveraging these last six weeks to remind folks of what he used to be. Correction, he says, politely and firmly: \u201cI\u2019m still that player. There\u2019s nothing I need to prove to anyone anymore.\u201d He was injured last spring, and in the summertime traded from Boston to Cleveland when Ainge figured Irving was an upgrade at point guard. And after healing for a half-season and understandably playing sporadically in his 15-game return, he was shipped to the Lakers on Feb. 8. His expiring contract appealed to the Lakers, who have made no secret of their desire to clear salary cap space for this summer\u2019s free agent market. All of which makes it very likely Thomas is merely a temp, especially given the Lakers\u2019 investment in rookie point guard Lonzo Ball. \u201cA lot of things that happened weren\u2019t in my control,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business and everything happens for a reason, and because I can\u2019t control it, I try not to worry too much about it. I know who I am as a player and a person and that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d Thomas\u2019 steep confidence is admirable and the very reason he carved out an NBA career. The NBA is more likely to see the next Kevin Durant walk through the door than the next Thomas \u2014 the last pick in the 2011 Draft who became the shortest man in league history to average 28.8 ppg. Last season was magical for Thomas: 43 straight games of 20 or more points as well as 50 straight games with a 3-pointer . There was the 53-point showing against the Washington Wizards in the playoffs (which came days after flying cross-country to console family following his sister\u2019s fatal car accident) and leading the Celtics to the East finals. After he injured his hip in Game 2 of the East finals \u2014 again, out of his control \u2014 the bottom fell out and Thomas is still struggling to regain familiar footing. Two trades later, it\u2019s all still a daze. And while Thomas says he still knows who he is as a player, what about the teams interested in him in free agency this summer? What conclusion will they reach as they weigh two solid seasons against this very strange one? His biggest issue isn\u2019t his size or his troublesome defense. It might be his position. Point guards are plentiful, as common in the NBA as tattoos. Most teams already have a standout point guard (or a very good one) or are developing one (as the Lakers are). A handful of teams could be shopping for one in free agency, but salary cap room is more precious than ever. The universe for Thomas, good as he can be when healthy, might be limited. How much is he looking for? The days of a salary cap increase are over and it\u2019s hard to imagine Thomas getting Jrue Holiday money ($26 million per season). \u201cI\u2019m looking to sign a long-term deal this summer but anything can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t control it and can\u2019t worry too much about it. I was only in Sacramento for three years, Boston for almost three years and the other stops were temporary. I\u2019m looking hopefully to sign long term and call someplace home.\u201d What\u2019s important to know is Thomas, at 29, is still looking for his big payday, thus the urgency for him to cash in. He made a lowly six figures in each of his first three seasons, then landed with the Phoenix Suns in 2014 via a sign-and-trade deal ( four years, $27 million ). That contract quickly made him the best bargain in the NBA once he landed in Boston , as he averaged 19, 22.2 and 28.9 ppg there. That and stability are important to him, after hop-scotching with the Sacramento Kings, Suns, Celtics, Cavs and Lakers. He\u2019s a unique player, a scoring point guard who thrived in a Boston system that gave him freedom and shots while covering for his defense. His size makes it critical for him to be paired with a big guard to compensate. Will another team tweak itself to suit Thomas? Or can he thrive in almost any system? \u201cThey know who I am,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell them nothing. They know what I bring to the table and what I can do for a franchise.\u201d The Cavs initially thought Thomas was a reasonable replacement for Irving and were willing to stay patient while he needed seven months to recover from off-season hip surgery . Suddenly, that patience became an issue when the Cavs went 7-8 once Thomas returned. He wasn\u2019t 100 percent and averaged 14.7 ppg, but the Cavs pulled the plug anyway, sensing the season was slipping away. He went from being LeBron James\u2019 teammate and possibly playing for a title to landing on a team that\u2019s 26-34 and 11 games out of first place. \u201cI\u2019m not bitter,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI only played 15 games in Cleveland after sitting out seven months. I have no hard feelings. My thing is to move on and do what I can for the Lakers.\u201d Still, he\u2019s in an awkward situation now. In addition to Ball, the Lakers are giving playing time to rookie Josh Hart, who started Monday against the Atlanta Hawks. A compromise has been reached; Thomas will get a reasonable amount of time to showcase himself in the final weeks without the Lakers sacrificing their youth. The club is pleased so far with his cooperation, willingness to conform and give pointers to the young locker room when asked. That\u2019s all Lakers president Magic Johnson wanted from Thomas after the trade. \u201cHe told me to be who you are, be special, take control of this team and take this team to the next level, wherever that level is, and lead these young guys,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHey, I\u2019m still young myself, just 29 years old, still in my prime, still trying to find my way and get back to the level I\u2019m used to playing at. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to get my rhythm back, get comfortable with this new situation and win as many games as possible and most importantly play well. I\u2019m going to do that, so I\u2019m looking forward to these last games to see what we could do with it.\u201d It\u2019s easy to empathize with Thomas because he had little say in what transpired once he hurt his hip. Even more, he has limited say with the Lakers now and in free agency this summer. He doesn\u2019t totally control his destiny. At least the Basketball Gods will relinquish their suffocating grip and maybe that\u2019s the first step in the right direction. \u201cI\u2019ve got so much more to show,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m healthy and able to be who I am, the world knows what I bring. There\u2019s nothing I need to prove to anybody anymore. I need to get back to 100 percent and that will come.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

As Monday night\u2019s game against the Phoenix Suns proved, Anthony Davis is more than holding his own in carrying the load for New Orleans. Davis was in an amazing zone last night, netting 53 points, 18 rebounds and blocked five shots in a 125-116 victory. The Pelicans have run off six straight wins and are 7-5 since losing Cousins. But there\u2019s more to be said about Davis\u2019 monster game against the Suns. He has scored no fewer than 27 points in a game during this win streak, scoring at least 38 five times and more than 40 four times. Additionally, this was the third 50-point game in Davis\u2019 career . By the time he hit his 21st free throw last night, the Suns had to put 6-foot-8 rookie Josh Jackson on Davis because veterans Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss and Alex Len had all fouled out. * NBA.com\/Stats:  Relive every basket from Davis\u2019 big night Davis became the first player to record 50 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks in a game since Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo had 52 points, 22 rebounds and seven blocks in the Buffalo Braves\u2019 116-109 loss to the Boston Celtics on Feb. 22, 1974. Davis\u2019 50-point game also helped the NBA at large, marking the 12th 50-point game in the league this season.

The last player to post similar numbers in a six-game span was McAdoo, who averaged 41.8 ppg and 16.0 rpg on 61.5 percent shooting in March of 1975. Last night\u2019s performance by Davis left many practically speechless, including his coach, Alvin Gentry. \u201cHe\u2019s just playing great basketball. I don\u2019t know what else to say about it,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI just think that he\u2019s dominating on both ends. He\u2019s carrying the load, offensively. Rebounding the basketball.

In his first meeting with reporters almost a week after the Sports Illustrated story that also included allegations of sexual misconduct against former team president Terdema Ussery, Cuban wouldn\u2019t address how much he knew about those complaints. Ussery worked for Cuban for 15 years and was investigated by the Mavericks over similar allegations in 1998, two years before Cuban bought the team. Cuban has hired two former prosecutors to investigate the complaints and the franchise\u2019s workplace practices. \u201cAll of that will come out from the investigators\u2019 report, so I\u2019ll defer to that,\u201d Cuban said in one of several brief responses as he sat next to Marshall, who has been given authority by her owner to decide how the club will respond to the independent report. Marshall was senior vice president of human resources at AT&T when she took on the additional role of chief diversity officer in 2015. Sports Illustrated reported Ussery made sexually suggestive remarks to several women. He spent 18 years with the team before going to the sports apparel company Under Armour in 2015, a job he left after less than six months. The SI report said team website reporter Earl Sneed was twice involved in domestic assault cases while working for the Mavericks, including a guilty plea in a case that was dismissed when he met the conditions of the agreement. Sneed and former human resources director Buddy Pittman were fired in the wake of the report, which included allegations that executives weren\u2019t responsive when women complained of workplace violations. Marshall said all current employees would be interviewed, and that she intended to meet with former employees as well. \u201cThe process failed somewhere,\u201d said Marshall, who retired from AT&T last May with more than 30 years of telecommunications experience going back to 1981 with Pacific Bell. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it failed. And so that\u2019s what we have to dig out. So I will be meeting one-on-one every single employee of the organization. I\u2019m calling it my own `March Madness.\u201d\u2018 Marshall\u2019s one-liner drew laughs during what was a mostly upbeat news conference for what seems to be a welcomed addition. Her arrival was praised by Rick Carlisle as \u201cdynamic\u201d and \u201ccharismatic\u201d after Marshall met with him and was introduced to the players by their coach. The smiles stopped \u2013 and the uncertainly ahead surfaced \u2013 each time the questions switched to Cuban. The normally outspoken star of the TV show \u201cShark Tank\u201d softly said \u201cnot at this point\u201d when asked if he could explain to Dallas fans how such a hands-on billionaire could be unaware of such explosive allegations on the business side of his operation. The SI report came a day before the NBA fined Cuban $600,000 for acknowledging that losing games intentionally was the best approach for a team that will miss the playoffs with a losing record for the second straight year. \u201cToday\u2019s not the time for me to talk about anything,\u201d Cuban said near the end of the news conference. Cuban reached out to Marshall, who founded her own consulting firm, after the SI report last week. They met the same day he called, and she was in place by Friday. \u201cLeadership at AT&T suggested her name to us and basically conveyed to us that their most devastating day at AT&T was when Cynt left,\u201d Cuban said, using Marshall\u2019s preferred version of her first name. \u201cThat and confirmation from untold number of people was all the confirmation I needed to hear.\u201d Marshall said she found Cuban to be transparent and honest in their first meeting, which lasted nearly an hour. But she still told him she would have to think about it, based on what she had read in the SI report. \u201cI\u2019m a brand,\u201d she said. \u201cI work very hard for the brand that I have. And I can\u2019t attach my brand to something I can\u2019t trust. By the time I left his office, spent a day with the folks, I said I absolutely will attach my brand to this organization.\u201d The team plans to establish a hotline for counseling and support services for past and current employees, and Cuban has said he is mandating sensitivity training for all employees, himself included.

He\u2019s said in the past that he would like to end his career with Cleveland, but because he hasn\u2019t given the team a long-term commitment, there is constant speculation that he may leave his home state a second time.

The Miami Heat have stood beside the South Florida community in the wake of the Feb. 14 shootings at Parkland\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Among the players doing so is Heat guard Dwyane Wade, who led the team in a moment of silence in honor of the 17 victims prior to last Saturday\u2019s game against the Memphis Grizzlies . On Monday after the Heat\u2019s practice, Wade addressed news regarding the death of one shooting victim in particular: 17-year-old Joaquin Oliver.

According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , Oliver became a naturalized citizen on January 2017, a few months after Wade had left the Heat via free agency to sign with the Chicago Bulls. Wade was bought out of his contract by the Bulls last summer and signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who traded him back to Miami on the Feb. 8 deadline .

Another chance for another Nance. A generation ago, Larry Nance, Sr., was a key part of a great Cleveland Cavaliers team \u2014 one that Magic Johnson famously dubbed \u201cThe Team of the \u201990s\u201d in the late \u201980s. Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls snuffed that out. Now, almost 30 years later, his son, Larry Nance, Jr., has the league\u2019s and the team\u2019s permission to take his father\u2019s jersey out of the rafters, where it was retired in 1995, and wear it again . This time, though, the odds are more in Cleveland\u2019s favor. The Cavs have this generation\u2019s Magic, and there\u2019s no Jordan to be found. There are assorted Kevin Durants and Stephen Currys; James Hardens and Chris Pauls, to be sure. But the Cavaliers, after shocking the NBA world at the trade deadline two weeks ago with three major deals that blew up the old, tired roster and revitalized it in one morning, have the only thing that matters: an engaged LeBron James, again bouncing on his toes. No one else on earth can bring in anyone as impactful. Or, as Kyle Korver put it, \u201cI am super excited about this team.\u201d Nance, Jr., and Jordan Clarkson came from the Los Angeles Lakers. Rodney Hood came from the Utah Jazz . George Hill came from the Sacramento Kings . Out went Isaiah Thomas and Dwyane Wade; Jae Crowder and Iman Shumpert; Derrick Rose and Channing Frye. Three huge cuts for first-year general manager Koby Altman, who also held onto the unprotected first-round pick the Cavs got from Boston (via Brooklyn) in the Kyrie Irving deal last summer. Hill is the only newcomer who was put in the starting lineup. The others have revitalized Cleveland\u2019s bench, giving Korver more room to operate as defenses suddenly have to stay attached to Clarkson\u2019s attacks \u2014 he\u2019s sixth in the league in bench scoring , behind Lou Williams, Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Nikola Mirotic and Hood \u2014 Hood\u2019s spot-ups and Nance\u2019s rim runs. They\u2019re mostly young \u2014 Hill is the only 30-something \u2014 and springy. They have the pace that coach Tyronn Lue has been begging for all year, without success. They went into Boston, with no practice time, much less any time to learn any tendencies, and horsed it over the Boston Celtics, getting deflections and runouts, burying 3-pointers and jumping up and down on the bench like a No. 15 seed beating a No. 2 seed in the NCAAs. The small things that they don\u2019t know \u2014 the plays, the directions to practice (Clarkson got horribly lost the first day), where to live \u2014 will have to be incorporated on the fly. There\u2019s no time. There\u2019s six weeks left in the regular season, and Kevin Love is still not back in the lineup, and there are some hungry teams right on Cleveland\u2019s haunches in the East who\u2019d love to surpass the Cavs for third in the conference. James, of course, has other ideas. \u201cI think we played well tonight, even though we lost,\u201d he said after Thursday\u2019s game, a loss to the resurgent Washington Wizards. \u201cI hate losing, obviously, but I think the way we played, the way we shared the ball, defensively we were flying around as well. Those guys, they played better than us tonight. (But) I liked the start and I like the direction we\u2019re headed in.\u201d Hill chased titles before in Indiana, against James\u2019 Miami Heat teams, when the Pacers had a young Paul George and a tall Roy Hibbert and a tough David West and a crazy Lance Stephenson. Hood made the playoffs last year with the Jazz. But Nance and Clarkson were on Lakers teams with no expectations. Cleveland, of course, has the ultimate expectation, with James\u2019 free agency looming. \u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d Nance Jr. said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of still learning how to adjust. Me, I\u2019ve kind of prided myself on doing whatever it takes to win, whether I was with the Lakers or the University of Wyoming. I feel like I fit right in here, and that kind of play style is what this team needs \u2014 get it off the glass, run and catch a few lobs.\u201d Clarkson didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d be traded. The Lakers had given him a $50 million deal in 2016. He, Nance Jr., Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball were going to be the core of a new Lakers team that just needed a star player to be the spoke of the wheel. The morning of the deadline, \u201cI was sleeping on the couch,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cThey was calling me \u2014 Rob (Pelinka, the Lakers\u2019 GM) and Magic (Johnson) and them was calling. We had shootaround; we had a game that day. So I kind of was like pushing the phone to the side. I was still trying to get some sleep. But I woke up and callled them back and they gave me the news.\u201d At least Clarkson is engaging in his new journey with a familiar face in Nance, Jr. Hill had to leave his 1-month old and 2-year olds to come to Cleveland. \u201cLiving out of a suitcase right now and trying to find a place to stay, with a newborn baby, it\u2019s kind of tough,\u201d Hill said. \u201cMy fiance and them are back in Texas, so it kind of takes a little bit off of me, not having to wake up every two hours with the baby. I\u2019m happy about that right now.\u201d But Hill is a vet who was thrilled to get out of Sacramento. The adjustment for him will be relatively quick (\u201cthe film room is going to be our friend,\u201d Korver said). The basic stuff is on all the new players\u2019 iPads; Lue and his coaches will have to simplify some of the rest. (Lue did run some of Clarkson\u2019s and Hood\u2019s favorite sets from L.A. and Utah in their first game with Cleveland. Clarkson was stunned. \u201cI got you,\u201d Lue said in response. \u201cI know what\u2019s going on.\u201d) Clarkson also had to adjust to a new phenomenon, one that every player does when they first get on the floor with James. \u201cThe first two games, I was hesitating,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be open. And I\u2019d be like, I\u2019m not that open . And I\u2019d take another dribble and I\u2019d be like, \u2019man, I\u2019m still open.\u2019 Even on the kickouts and stuff, you kind of sit there for a second and you\u2019re like, these ain\u2019t the shots that you\u2019re used to taking.\u201d Lue can throw all kinds of different lineups on the floor. Teams will play off of Hill and make Hood put the ball on the deck, to be sure. But Cleveland\u2019s got a lot more athletic personnel to deal with teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder, Toronto Raptors, Minnesota Timberwolves and the Rockets, all of whom blew the Cavs\u2019 doors off during their awful December and January. (Love, who broke his left hand earlier this month , said last week that he believes he\u2019ll be out around another month before returning.) James, per sources, wasn\u2019t expecting huge deals by the Cavs at the deadline, maybe a small one or two, before being informed the night before the deadline that there were big possibilities in the pipeline. He obviously was, and is, very close with Wade, respected Rose\u2019s work in getting healthy again and enjoyed Frye\u2019s personality. He didn\u2019t dislike Thomas, but they obvously didn\u2019t mix well on the floor. It\u2019s clear that James is once again engaged. He\u2019s vocal with his new teammates and his splits \u2014 which were awful in January \u2014 are back to their norms . But he says that was an independent decision of his, not a reaction to the work Altman did. \u201cI just think that I refocused myself,\u201d he said. \u201cEven before the deadline happened and before the trades happened, I had to refocus myself and understand that I\u2019m the leader of this team, and I have to be mentally sharp and mentally strong throughout anything. So even before the trade, I had planned on us having that team for the rest of the season. That was just my mindset. And you saw that in the Minnesota game (when James hit the game-winning shot at the buzzer). We hadn\u2019t made the trade then, and in the Minnesota game I just started changing my mindset. So that\u2019s just who I am and it\u2019s just where I am now. I think our team can be, we can be really good. We\u2019ve got 20-plus games left to try to figure it out. I think if we can do that, continue where we are now, I think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d But remaking a team that can beat Boston and\/or Toronto over seven games isn\u2019t going to be easy. The Wizards slowed the Cavs down and carved up their defense on Thursday. On Sunday, Danny Green dropped five 3-pointers on them, Cleveland couldn\u2019t put any ball pressure on Dejounte Murray and the San Antonio Spurs, already without Kawhi Leonard, won comfortably without any meaningful contributions from either Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili . And the Cavs\u2019 upcoming schedule is going to be a bear. Not the opponents, per se, but the workload. For the next six weeks \u2014 a span of 21 games, through April 6 \u2014 Cleveland will never have more than one day off between games. They played San Antonio Sunday; they play Brooklyn Tuesday . Off Wednesday; vs. Philly on Thursday . Off Friday; hosting Denver on Saturday . And on and on and on, including a West coast trip that begins two days after the Cavs play Detroit. There will be almost no practice time the rest of the regular season. \u201cThis is the challenge of this happening this late in the season,\u201d Korver said. \u201cI think we\u2019re all optimistic that we can figure this out. I think we\u2019ve shown the first two games \u2014 even (Thursday) in stretches \u2014 that we\u2019re not that far off already. But there\u2019s definitely a lot of things we can get better at. We can use guys\u2019 skills better.\u201d The alternative wasn\u2019t going to cut it, though. James\u2019 only goal is championships now, and the old Cavs \u2014 old being the key word \u2014 weren\u2019t championship material. This new collection will have to show it can perform in April and May, something that most of them have yet to do. But they\u2019ve given James belief. And that can go a long way. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be challenging,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very challenging. But I accept the challenge, and I think the guys are excited about trying to learn every day. The good thing about it is, now we\u2019re going to get to the point where we\u2019re playing every other day, so we can learn on the floor. \u201cWe have our film sessions, when we have our walkthroughs we have to continue to try and keep our mind sharp. It\u2019s all we have. We have to lean on that. We\u2019re not like Washington; we\u2019re not like Toronto. Obviously, Boston has some new guys and they\u2019re figuring it out as well. But we\u2019re not like a lot of the teams where we can just hang our hats on our chemistry and how long we\u2019ve been together. It\u2019s up to us to kind of fast track it \u2014 not shortcut the process, but fast track what we\u2019re trying to do. And see what happens.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Rodrigo Diaz: Well, I\u2019d disagree with your notion, Rodrigo, and your favorite team is a prime example of why. How has Utah rebuilt its roster since moving away from the Deron Williams-Carlos Boozer core of the aughts? Through the Draft. And during all of this rebuilding, Utah\u2019s only had two top-five picks: Enes Kanter ( third overall ) in 2011, and Dante Exum ( fifth ) in 2014. But the Jazz has nonetheless built a solid playoff-contending team, through drafting exceptionally well toward the bottom of the Lottery (Gordon Hayward with the ninth pick in 2010 ), smart trades ( getting the rights to Rudy Gobert , picked 27th by Denver in a pre-arranged Draft day deal in 2013). They\u2019ve also traded for players like George Hill for Ricky Rubio and developing while retaining undrafted guys like Joe Ingles and Royce O\u2019Neale. And \u2026 there\u2019s that Donovan Mitchell fellow, taken 13th overall in 2017 .  You simply cannot make everything \u201cfair\u201d for everyone in every instance. Teams like Utah, and Milwaukee, have to make up for the perception that they\u2019re not prime free-agent destinations by drafting well, making smart trades and not overpaying for the free agents\/developed players they do have (such as getting Ingles locked up for $13 million a year through 2021 instead of, say, $20 million per year). But it can be done. Tinkering Along the Margins. From Quentin Super: Funny you should ask that. I spent Friday at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, and spent much of it wondering just that: are people seeking changes simply for changes\u2019 sake? I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a whole lot more that needs to be fixed right now. I don\u2019t love the overdependence on 3-pointers in the current game, but fans do, and that\u2019s all that matters to the league. Changing the playoff format will necessarily create imbalances, no matter how you slice it; how is it fair that the winner of, say, a first-round series between Golden State and Philadelphia (if you seeded 1-16 regardless of conference and only by record, this would be a distinct possibility) then would play the winner of Cleveland-Milwaukee in the next round? How do you compensate for that? I just don\u2019t like the idea of a tournament, or some other contrived mechanism, to make things more \u201cexciting.\u201d I think the last day of the regular season is pretty damn exciting already when you have three or four teams within a game of one another for the final spot in each conference, as you most likely will have this year. Doubting Thomas in Detroit. ( No, not that one! ) From John Sommerdyke: I don\u2019t disagree with your notion that they need to sell tickets, but I think that\u2019s what Blake Griffin was brought in, in large part, to do. And how do you get Thomas when you\u2019re still on the hook to Jackson for $35 million for two more years? Doubt there\u2019s much of a market for him via trade, or Stan Van would have likely pulled the trigger by now and moved on.

Would you please shut up about that? 1) There was no column last week because of my Turner duties at All-Star weekend , so belated kudos both to the league for changing the selection format for the better, and to the players for a much better effort in the game. No one wants or expects 90-87, but some defensive intent such as Team LeBron and Team Stephen showed makes a huge difference. Now. #TeleviseTheDraft 2) I\u2019m not genetically capable of giving up on the Spurs yet, even Kawhi-less ones, as their effort in Cleveland Sunday showed. Having Rudy Gay back will be huge for them if Leonard, indeed, is out the rest of the season or for some long stretch. The Spurs used Gay as a stretch four to some effect earlier in the year. 3) One reason why I wish the NBA would hurry up and expand\/realign already: who wouldn\u2019t want the New Orleans Pelicans in the East so we could get more than two Greek Freak vs. AD, Jrue Holiday\/Eric Bledsoe hookups a year, like they had Sunday in an overtime thriller? 4) CWebb should be in the Hall of Fame. Period. End of sentence. 1) It depresses but no longer surprises to hear of workplace cultures as toxic as the one Sports Illustrated \u2019s Jon Wertheim and Jessica Luther unearthed last week with the Mavericks . (It is cold comfort to note that the basketball side of the franchise, its players and coaches, were apparently not only not involved in the awful treatment of female team employees, but were viewed as the one group of men around whom the women felt safest.) It does not make me feel good to know both Terdema Ussery and Earl K. Sneed, who are in the middle of SI\u2019s reporting of the worst abuses, and have, in Ussery\u2019s case, offered weak tea denials. It does not feel credible that Mark Cuban \u2014 among the most hands-on owners in the history of sports \u2014 had no idea that Ussery was accused by so many women of inappropriate conduct over such a long period of time. It is minimally palatable that the Mavericks have hired two well-respected attorneys to conduct an internal investigation into what happened. It is difficult to see how the league could punish the franchise either through fines and\/or Draft pick penalties, as some have suggested, as there is, at least not at present, no known evidence of a cover-up; only terrible, awful middle management decisions that gave no comfort to the aggrieved. The establishing of a hotline that goes directly to the league for team employees leaguewide who have suffered unwanted advances is a good if overdue idea. Cuban does seem genuinely determined to improve his company from within. That does not excuse what happened in his company on his watch. 2) Arming teachers? You\u2019re joking, right? So, Joe or Jane Teacher, in the middle of going over 7th grade math, maybe trig, or listing the real-time evolution of how the 14th Amendment was ratified, turns and sees someone with a gun entering their class, or hears shots down the hallway. Where is their gun? Is it locked away in a drawer? Is it in an unlocked drawer? (And if the drawer is unlocked\u2026doesn\u2019t that create its own set of potential hazards, whether or not there\u2019s an armed person in the school?) Is Joe or Jane\u2019s first instinct to get the gun, or to protect the students in the class? They have about three seconds to decide. And assuming they get the gun, and go into the hallway, are they going to have the discipline to wait to see who has the gun, and who is shooting? Or is it more likely that, being civilians and being understandably terrified, they may make a mistake and shoot at the wrong person? Or, people? Or, shoot at the right person, but miss \u2014 and potentially hit an innocent bystander? And when the police arrive, and see Joe or Jane Teacher walking down the hallway with a gun, is their instinct always \u2014 always, and it has to be always \u2014 going to be \u2018oh, that\u2019s Joe\/Jane Teacher; they\u2019re okay; let me go look for the actual shooter?\u2019 Or will they, on occasion, go \u2018hey, there\u2019s a person with a gun; I have to draw my weapon just to be safe?\u2019 To recap: the former has to be the reaction of every cop, in every situation, every time. Because if there\u2019s one time a cop draws his or her gun and fires in confusion and\/or fear at a teacher who has a gun, and kills them, that cop and his or her city will be sued to the studs by the family of the slain teacher. And if the teacher with the gun is, say, an African-American male, do you really expect me to believe every cop is going to react benignly to that sight? Come on. We do not need to arm teachers. We do not need to put that incredible fight or flight, live or die, never be wrong, always aim and fire correctly pressure on someone who already has incredible stress in their (almost always) ridiculously underpaid profession. They aren\u2019t military people. They aren\u2019t cops. They\u2019re teachers. What we need to help them is to get some of these damn guns off the streets, and make those who would buy them prove that they\u2019re sane, and don\u2019t have a criminal record, and are going to be responsible owners of a weapon that is designed, plainly, to kill as many people as possible in as short a period of time as possible. What we need to do is ban semi-automatic weapons from civilian purchase. You can defend your home with a handgun or shotgun if you know what you\u2019re doing, and Lord knows there are plenty of those available for legal purchase. We lived tens of thousands of years as a species without AR-15s. We can live tens of thousands of years more without them. In fact, it would greaten our odds of doing so. 3) RIP, Dan Fegan. Stunning news that he was killed in an automobile accident over the weekend in Aspen. He was, at one point, one of the two or three most powerful agents in the game. He played hard but was a fierce advocate for his clients, as evidenced by the deals he got for so many of them over the years. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

DeRozan opened up about his experience to Doug Smith of the Toronto Star :"},{"id":47581,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-qa-jimmy-butler-minnesota-timberwolves","date":"2018-02-26","title":"Morning Tip Q&A: Jimmy Butler","content":" He carried a football to Los Angeles, a reminder of the good times and his fellow 2016 Summer Olympians and 2018 All-Stars \u2014 Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan; Paul George and Kyrie Irving; Klay Thompson and Draymond Green \u2014 had in Rio. Jimmy Butler had fun in L.A., and he was having fun in his first season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, bringing Tom Thibodeau the kind of production and leadership he\u2019d seen from Butler during their time together in Chicago, when Butler made the first two of his four All-Star apperances. Through 61 games, the most of any team going into the All-Star break, Butler was the Wolves\u2019 leading scorer, and the chief reason Minnesota was having its best season since the Kevin Garnett\/Sam Cassell\/Latrell Sprewell days. His season was stopped in its tracks, though, when he suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee during Friday\u2019s game against Houston. Butler underwent surgery Sunday and is out indefinitely , though there appears to be a chance he could be back in time for the playoffs \u2014 if Minnesota can hold on and make the playoffs without him. ( Note: This interview was conducted just before Butler suffered his injury.) Butler\u2019s value is obvious, yet if he can\u2019t come back this season, it will leave the Wolves with less information in an upcoming offseason where they\u2019ll have to make a big choice. As of July 9, the fourth anniversary of the max deal he signed in 2014 while with the Bulls , Butler is eligible for a \u201crenegotiation\/extension\u201d \u2014 similar to what the Houston Rockets did a year ago with James Harden. As a player with between seven and nine years of experience, Butler could make a maximum next year of approximately $31.2 million in 2018-19, 105 percent of this year\u2019s 7-9 year max deal. Butler is currently set to make $20.4 million nexet year, so the Wolves would have to find almost $11 million in additional cap room to give to Butler, then work off his \u201cnew\u201d number of $31.2 million to extend him out four more years after that, through 2023. The exact number wouldn\u2019t be known until the 2018-19 cap was finalized, but it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $190 million. That would keep Butler from becoming an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2019, along, potentially, with the likes of Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and Kemba Walker, in what could be a monster class. Thibodeau, of all people, knows what Walker brings, and how hard it is to get a player of his caliber, and the two of them have a strong relationship. So the likelihood of Minnesota letting Butler get to 2019 and test the market would seem to be slight. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Thibodeau said of Butler before the injury. \u201cHe\u2019s played at an MVP level. Just to change everything here, after 13 years of losing, and just the impact he\u2019s had on everyone, in terms of how hard he plays, how unselfish he plays on both ends of the floor, never takes a play off, I think that goes a long way, particularly with your younger players. I think a lot of the things he went through in Chicago in terms of being a younger player, KAT (Karl-Anthony Towns) and Wigg (Anthony Wiggins) are going through now. He can help them from that standpoint, also.\u201d For now, though, the salient issue is Butler\u2019s knee, not his 401(k). Me: Knowing Thibs the way you do, how much did you want to be vocal with this group, and how much did you want to lay back and let him lay the foundation? Jimmy Butler: I think there\u2019s a fine line in between both. Everybody gets tired of the yelling, the antics that Thibs has \u2014 which isn\u2019t a bad thing. That\u2019s Thibs. He\u2019s into the game, he\u2019s into the scouting report, to all of the good stuff. But at times, you need somebody else to relay a message \u2014 the same message that he\u2019s getting across. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s difficult at times. I think it\u2019s just making me better, in that part of communicating with my guys, my peers, and trying to get across the point that he wants. A lot of it is a lot of talking, through Thibs, for Thibs \u2014 sometimes against Thibs. A lot of time talking to everybody. Me: How many times do you step to him and say \u2018let me handle this?\u2019 JB: A lot. A lot. Because he may not see everything the way that we see it out there on the floor. And, you know, things change. Guys start making shots that normally don\u2019t, that goes against the scouting report. It\u2019s just NBA players, you know what I mean? You never know what you\u2019re going to get on any certain night. A lot of times, I\u2019m like, \u2018Thibs, I\u2019ll handle it to the best of my abilities,\u2019 when I\u2019m out there on the court. I\u2019ll make sure that he knows he has to do this, or we have to do that. And he gives me that freedom and that ability to do that. Me: I would imagine that Karl is probably relatively easy to talk to, because he has that kind of open personality. With Wigg, do you have to talk to him in private, put an arm around him? JB: All you have to do is tell Wigg one time. He wants to do right by everybody. But he\u2019s going to always to try to do exactly what you tell him to do. That\u2019s the good part about Wiggs. You really don\u2019t have to tell him more than once. He gets it, he understands it, he doesn\u2019t want to step on anybody\u2019s toes. So if you tell Wiggs, you\u2019ve got to do this, you don\u2019t have to worry about Wiggs not doing it. He\u2019s going to make sure it happens. Everybody\u2019s different. Some people, as good or as bad as it sounds, will look at you like, \u2018yeah, whatever.\u2019 That\u2019s just part of this league, having NBA guys. You can\u2019t tell everybody everything. But the ones that you can, you run with those. Me: So why is this team\u2019s defense so bad? JB: A lot of it is effort. Defense is all about if you want to play or not, if you really take matchups personal. A lot of guys don\u2019t. Once again, that\u2019s the league that we\u2019re in. That\u2019s not the league that used to be. A lot of guys are offensive minded, which is good at some points and times, but bad at others, at lots of others. I wish I could say I want everybody to play defense as hard as I do. It\u2019s not a reality. With that being said, we\u2019ve just got to find ways in games. Me: Does that devalue a two-way guy in some ways? JB: Nah. It don\u2019t devalue whatever two-way guy you\u2019re talking about. (Smiles) It angers me a bit. But I\u2019ve learned over my years that not everybody goes about the game that I do. It still makes me mad, but it doesn\u2019t make me as mad as it used to. It doesn\u2019t make me lose as much sleep as it used to. When that all settles in, you figure out a way to do things. I think we\u2019re in a good spot; don\u2019t get me wrong. Can it be better? Yeah. Will it be better? I hope so\u2026I hope it clicks. When someone\u2019s sitting at dinner, everybody\u2019s sitting at dinner, it\u2019s just like, whoa! You know what, I could do this better. It starts with yourself. It starts with myself. It starts with that guy, and that guy. If you don\u2019t hold yourself to that standard, no one else can do it for you. Me: They can take you off the market this summer with a renegotiation and extension. How important is it for that not to be an issue going into 2019? JB: Me? Me: You. JB: Oh, I\u2019m not worried about it. I mean, in the most humble way possible, if they don\u2019t take care of me this summer, I think the summer after that, I\u2019m\u2019a end up playing somewhere. Let\u2019s not worry about that. Look, money\u2019s never the issue for me. If you win, that takes care of everything. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do right now. When that presents itself, we\u2019ll think about it and talk about it. Me: Is this a championship caliber group they\u2019ve put together here, in your mind? JB: On paper. I don\u2019t think we play hard enough right now. I don\u2019t think we guard the way we\u2019re supposed to in order to win. There are a lot of things that we have to be better at, night in and night out, no matter if the opponent is home, away, neutral. No matter what the start time is. You\u2019ve got to play hard. We do not do that. I\u2019m not afraid to say that we don\u2019t do that. So, how do we change it? Like I said, it starts with everybody as an individual. If you can say you\u2019re giving your all, (bleep), we\u2019re going to be in a good position to win. \u2014 Kings big man Jack Cooley ( @JackCooligan45 ), Thursday, 1:46 p.m., indecisive.

Friday marked my first visit to the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston , where the latest in advanced statistics ideas and technologies continue to set the cutting edge for where all sports will be heading. The revolution is over; analytics won. Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets\u2019 GM who started Sloan a dozen years ago with Jessica Gelman, now the CEO of Kraft Analytics Group, is the high priest of the modern NBA game.  This year\u2019s A-listers included at Sloan Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, National Basketball Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts, Five Thirty Eight\u2019s Nate Silver, assorted NBA and NFL owners, and a certain former federal government executive whose presence filled the convention hall\u2019s huge main building, but whose remarks cannot be detailed here at any length, lest the Sloan Cops come and wrest away my laptop and smack about the head and shoulders with mallets. But I\u2019m a newbie, and this is the 12th Sloan. I feel so far behind. Which is how I often feel about today\u2019s NBA. So many of these people are so much smarter than I am or ever will be. It\u2019s intimidating. Sam Hinkie, he of the The Process, is here, very much a rock star as he amiably chats with fans and compatriots in the hallway, after getting a thunderous ovation when sitting on a panel with former Miami Heat star Chris Bosh. Hinkie has been coming to Sloan since its initial iteration with about 75 people in a couple of conference rooms. Now, every room in the ginormous Boston Convention Center is filled \u2014 with paper proposals and panel discussions, wearables and ghosting and Esports. You enter a room. An earnest young woman is discussing high resolution shot capture and an improved method for shooter evaluation. I know she has an algorithm for her idea. The rest of it is Sanskrit to me, but not to the equally earnest young people nodding in agreement as she breaks down her methods. You don\u2019t get to the paper presentation that promises \u201ca deep reinforcement learning approach to studying the double team in the NBA.\u201d You walk \u2026 past the Data Visualization Room, past the Catapault wearables display (\u201cPlay Smart. Defy Limits.\u201d) These are smart people \u2014 really smart people \u2014 talking to each other, in a world that does not include or need you. But the problem, of course, is you. These people want to share their ideas about sports, and the NBA, with anyone who\u2019ll listen and give them a fair shake. They\u2019re excited about their ideas. They believe their ideas will be helpful to anyone who loves the game as much as they do. It is you that is judging them, not the other way around. Take the five former Apple guys who developed HomeCourt.ai , a shot tracking system that uses artificial intelligence (here, AI is not Allen Iverson) to chart practice shots using nothing but an iPhone. There\u2019s no equipment to buy; just an app to download. The app can superimpose a 3-point line on the screen if the court on which you\u2019re shooting doesn\u2019t have one. Your shooting session stats from each area of the court are charted just as they do on NBA.com. HomeCourt was one of the entries this year in the Startup Competition Performance Devices track. The winner among the entries selected by a judging panel would get a $5,000 first prize. \u201cMost people can\u2019t afford a shooting coach,\u201d said Alex Wu, one of the ex-Apples. \u201cWe want kids to get outside more. Having something like this, they\u2019ll be out shooting and won\u2019t be inside watching YouTube videos all day.\u201d Having two tweenage boys who sit inside watching YouTube videos all day, this struck a nerve. Then there was Vijay Shravah, whose new company, Fansure , was an entry in the Startup Competition\u2019s Technology Services track. Fansure is, essentially, insurance for fans in case a star player doesn\u2019t play in a particular game due to rest. Shravah got the idea after he and a buddy went in on Golden State season tickets, just before Stephen Curry and the Warriors exploded in 2012. \u201cAll of a sudden we had all of these games to go to,\u201d Shravah said. And he began to notice that, here and there, some of his favorite players would be healthy scratches, as coaches made strategic decisions down the stretch of the regular season. Enter Fansure. The idea is this: after you buy a ticket for a game, you contact Fansure. You tell them the player you want to \u201cinsure,\u201d and pay Fansure a nominal fee \u2014 about seven to 10 percent of the cost of your ticket, according to the company website. If the player is then held out for rest and it is noted as such on the official box score, you get 50 percent of what you paid for the ticket back, less the fee you paid Fansure. You can purchase additional insurance on a player in case he sits out a game due to injury, as long as the injury isn\u2019t disclosed beforehand. This is an interesting idea. And, really, that\u2019s what Sloan seems to be about: smart people who are trying to come up with more good ideas to make the game better. That it is often done in a language unfamiliar to me does not make it bad, or impugn the motives of those who are trying to implement them. And that\u2019s something you would only know by coming here.  There is a panel, \u201cNBA 2.0\u201d New Rules to Impact to the Game.\u201d Now, in reality, this is but a mash of previously-discussed ideas: fixing the Draft, a tournament for teams at the bottom of the playoff standings in each conference, four points for longer shots, etc. And my friend Kevin Arnovitz from ESPN.com, who is moderating, starts with a question: why is there still such a desire to \u201cfix\u201d what is no longer broken? The NBA is doing great by almost any metric: ratings are up, franchise valuations have exceeded $1 billion for every team for the first time in history, according to Forbes Magazine . \u201cWhy beam up New Coke when everything\u2019s working?,\u201d he asks. Because \u2026 you can, comes the answer. And, it makes sense: if you can make something one percent better than it currently is, why wouldn\u2019t you try that? For example, says Evan Wasch, the NBA\u2019s Senior Vice President for Basektball Strategy and Analytics, the average NBA game is now taking about two hours, 10 minutes, which is well within the acceptable window for the league\u2019s broadcast partners, ESPN\/ABC and Turner (and Turner, as I always point out at times like these, runs NBA.com). Yet there remain three areas where the game\u2019s flow is still slowed: timeouts, commercials and free throws. So, one of the ideas the people in Wasch\u2019s office are kicking around is, why not make a free throw worth two points, or even three \u2014 but only shoot one free throw instead of two? It\u2019s an idea. It\u2019s not anywhere close to being implemented. But these are the kinds of things you think about in Wasch\u2019s office.  The league is also aware about the dominance of the 3-pointer in today\u2019s game. Most teams are somewhere between the mid-30s and high-30s in percentages of their shots per game that are 3-pointers. The Rockets, of course, are out near Pluto compared to the rest of the league, with 53.2 percent of its shots this season coming behind the arc , per NBA.com\/Stats. \u201cHistorically, the Rockets are an indicator of where the league is going,\u201d Wasch said. But, the league knows that there can be too much of a good thing, and it stands ready to recalibrate if the 3-point imbalance becomes unwieldy. \u201cIf our 85 shots (per team) per game are 90 percent 3-pointers, we have a problem,\u201d Wasch said. So, it\u2019s good to be here and see what people are thinking about when it comes to the game and its future. Yet I remain concerned about one area: diversity. Not just racial and gender diversity (though the crowd at Sloan is, overwhelming, white and male, many in jackets and shirts half a size too big for them), but diversity of thought, experience, class. Yes, there\u2019s nothing wrong with hiring people who are writing cool things about basketball on the internet. Except, a lot of people still don\u2019t have regular access to the internet. Which is why I was glad to run into Nazr Mohammed, one of my all-time favorite guys. Late last year, Naz was hired by the Thunder, one of the teams graced by his presence during his 18-year NBA career, as a \u201cprofessional evaluation scout\/identification and intelligence,\u201d which is a typically OKC way of saying \u201cwe\u2019re gonna teach you everything about the front office.\u201d Lots of teams are implementing similar programs for former players. The Players\u2019 Association has a Leadership Development Program that runs during the Las Vegas Summer League and had more than 20 current and former players take part last year. But Naz also reminded me that the NBA is doing the same thing with its Basketball Operations Associate Program, run through the office of Bethany Donaphin, the league\u2019s Associate VP of Basketball Operations, and a former WNBA player for the New York Liberty . After her six-year pro career ended, Donaphin, a Stanford grad, wanted to make sure she was ready for the next step of her life. She went to Wharton. She interned with Deloitte. But she knew that other ex-players may not have those kinds of opportunities. The Associate Program helps fill in some of those gaps. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning and tinkering,\u201d she said by phone Sunday, \u201cbut we\u2019re trying to give former players who show an aptitude for (future front office jobs) the chance to learn and train.\u201d This year, two former NBA players \u2014 Acie Law and Cherokee Parks \u2014 and two former WNBA players \u2014 Lindsey Harding and Michele Van Gorp \u2014 moved to New York for full-time immersion in the NBA office, sitting with league lawyers and cap people to learn the CBA, learning how to break down data from Second Spectrum and Synergy from the league\u2019s analytics people, doing scouting, learning how to write a business plan from the league\u2019s marketing people. One of last year\u2019s graduates, Allison Feaster, a 10-year WNBA player and Harvard grad , now has a full-time gig in the G League as Manager of Player Personnel & Coach Relations. (An aside: if Harding isn\u2019t an NBA or WNBA GM\/Director of Player Personnel within the next five years, something\u2019s way wrong. She was a great player who has an incredible way with people. Just all aces across the board.) Someone like Donaphin, a really smart former player, is sensitive to the notion that the very idea of being a former player is something that still works against ex-players in some front offices. The Associate Program eliminates that excuse. And Law, Parks, Harding and Van Gorp were all at Sloan. So, all of this is to say: if someone can help with the \u201ctransition layers,\u201d as Donaphin puts it, and can make the language of the advanced decipherable, bring on the coefficients and algorithms.

Long an admirer of Cleveland\u2019s superstar, Popovich praised James for his activism and for being a role model to \u201cmillions\u201d of kids. Popovich also defended James\u2019 right to speak after he was recently criticized by Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham, who said the NBA\u2019s most high-profile player should \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d after he criticized President Donald Trump. \u201cTo me, when I heard about that, it was just an unbelievable show of arrogance for a talking head to try and tell someone else if they can speak, what they can speak about and when and where to do it,\u201d Popovich said before the Spurs faced James and the Cavaliers. \u201cIt\u2019s just ludicrous, but to not have a feel for who this guy is. \u201cI mean, think about when he came into public view, how young was he? And to this day he hasn\u2019t missed a step, he hasn\u2019t fallen off the ledge and he\u2019s been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially kids with lesser opportunity and haven\u2019t had the same advantages as others. \u201cThey see in this guy somebody who has consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace and gives them a voice and lets them know that you can speak about anything.\u201d James and Popovich have developed a strong bond during their years together, facing each other three times in the NBA Finals. Popovich also was an assistant coach to James on the 2004 U.S. Olympic team. Popovich shrugged off his links to James. \u201cHis career is way bigger than he and Pop,\u201d Popovich said with a laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s a great respect that goes both ways, for sure. I love the guy. But I guess we\u2019ve both been around for a while and competed a few times and we\u2019ve each won and lost. But it\u2019s never been an individual sort of thing. He\u2019s always been a team guy and hopefully I\u2019m the same way.\u201d James said he\u2019s never been around a player like James, who doesn\u2019t seem to be showing any signs of slowing down at 33. And while Popovich marvels at James\u2019 physical gifts, he\u2019s more impressed by how the four-time MVP carries himself off the floor. James has had a major impact in Northeast Ohio with his community efforts. His foundation has supported kids in the Akron area to attend college tuition free, which is why Popovich was so put off by Ingraham\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHow cool is that for kids to see that, to have that superhero?

In celebration of Black History Month, we explore the unique bond that these officials have with one another and the impact that attending an HBCU had on their personal and professional lives. We continue our series with Karl Lane, who graduated from Philander Smith College in 1998. Lane is in his seventh season as an NBA referee and entered the 2017-18 season having officiated in 326 regular-season games as well as 167 games in the D-League. Q. Were you aware that nine of the league\u2019s 65 officials went to HBCUs? I didn\u2019t know there were that many. When I got the email (regarding this interview) I was actually with one of them at the Replay Center and we were having dinner and he informed me. After that we figured out some of the rest. HBCU Referees Series: Derrick Stafford: Morehouse College Sean Corbin: Coppin State Q. Is there a special bond in having that shared experience? We didn\u2019t know, so I really don\u2019t know about how much of a bond it is. I think most of the ones that did go (to an HBCU) that I\u2019m close with we were in fraternities, but we were all in different ones. I think two were in the same fraternity and I was in a different one, so I\u2019m the outcast of the group, so we kind of joke with each other about that. It\u2019s not something that really came up; I knew a few of them went to Southern like Courtney [Kirkland] and CJ [Washington], but it really never came up that much. Q. What made you decide to attend an HBCU? My decision was pretty easy. My grandmother actually went to the same school that I went to. She wanted me to go there. I was originally going to Northern Illinois and she said she prefer that I go to [Philander Smith College] since she went there and her mother went there as well. During the time that my grandmother went to college \u2013 believe it or not her name is Lois Lane (laughs), nobody ever believes me when I tell them that \u2013 she actually played basketball and graduated with a degree in Home Economics in 1951. During that time with basketball for women they played half court and she was considered a scorer. So her history with the school made the decision a little bit easier for me. It was a family tradition. And I think I made the right decision by following that tradition Q. What was the biggest impact that attending an HBCU had on your life? I think it was making me grow up. I was playing basketball during that time, and even though I split between home and the dorm, it kind of made me grow up a little bit more. Just that whole experience and then that culture of being in a fraternity, being a leader around the school and being looked up to; it\u2019s a smaller university so everybody knew you and it was a family-type vibe. Q. What was the best piece of advice someone gave you during college? It was one of my professors that I had for different stuff throughout my college career. And near the end he was the athletic director and he just told me about always being professional \u2013 whether it\u2019s when I come to a class, or when I step on a court, when I do anything. Not being late, just being the part, being professional and taking that through throughout your life no matter the situation. Q. When did you see becoming a referee as a career path? Was it during your time in college? It was actually almost an accident. After I finished my playing career, I was still going to school; I still had a couple of hours to finish. I was working at this community center that was right across the street from the college. And I started working at the community center and one of the guys that was there was kind of a mentor to me, he ended up talking me into working the summer pro league, which was like a pro-am and had players at the time like Corliss Williamson, Joe Johnson, Derek Fisher, all those guys played in it. I played in it once or twice, but then I knew that I was done playing and then I started to get into officiating that way. Q. Who is a mentor that made the biggest impact on you during college? It was one named Huey Pugh. His basketball career actually fizzled out around D-II, but he was another guy that taught me about being professional. He officiated some of the games that I played in, and we ended up being in the same fraternity and somehow we got connected and started talking after that. He taught me a lot and helped me learn how to deal with things not just on the court, but also on a professional level when it comes to officiating. Q. How important is the celebration of Black History Month not only to you personally, but in society in general? I really think the NBA does a great job of celebrating Black History Month. It humbles me to see all the people. I\u2019ve been going to some of the games this past month; I was in New York and looked courtside and saw Reverend Jesse Jackson there. I had met him once before at a game \u2013 ironically during Black History Month in Memphis \u2013 so its just humbling to see the growth of African-Americans in this day and age and how successful we can be with a little effort. Q. Name an African-American pioneer who made an impact on you (and why?) Me being from Little Rock, it was actually nine. We had the Little Rock Nine. Being one of the first integrated high schools and that being my home state, and knowing my sister actually went to Central High and they were in our conference when we played, so just all the historical aspects of that school and what that meant for all of them to go through what they did just for a better education, those are ones that I kind of look at. One of the first students that went on that first day \u2013 you can see that historic picture where everybody is yelling at her and she was the only one there. She didn\u2019t have a phone so she didn\u2019t know that they had moved the day. Years ago, I would always see her walking around town and you can tell her life was a little bit harder than maybe some of the other ones that were a little bit more successful that went through that. And you can see her and still see how she\u2019s still impacted to this day. And not in a good way. So there is just a lot of history through them and a lot of sacrifices that they made \u2013 being those nine that went to that school."},{"id":41617,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-meniscus-surgery-official-release","date":"2018-02-25","title":"Minnesota Timberwolves' Jimmy Butler out indefinitely after surgery to repair meniscus in right knee","content":"MINNEAPOLIS\/ST.

The award recognizes an NBA player each month who best reflects the passion that the league and its players share for giving back to their communities. Kaiser Permanente and the NBA are honoring Durant for consistently working to improve the lives of students, families in need, and at-risk populations across the Bay Area. In January, Durant announced a $3 million donation to the University of Texas\u2019 basketball programs and its Center for Sports Leadership and Innovation (CSLi). In addition to renovations to his alma mater\u2019s various athletic facilities, the donation will be used by CLSi which encourages character development, leadership skills and promotes the long-term wellbeing of student athletes and coaches.  Working with Make-A-Wish, Durant granted the wishes of three boys facing life-threatening illnesses, bringing each to Oakland for the Warriors game vs. the New York Knicks, and a special one-on-one experience with Durant and his teammates.

In celebration of Black History Month, we explore the unique bond that these officials have with one another and the impact that attending an HBCU had on their personal and professional lives. We continue our series with Sean Corbin, who graduated from Coppin State University in 1990. Corbin is in his 24th season as an NBA referee and entered the 2017-18 season with 1,260 regular season and 74 playoff games to his credit, as well as being an official during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Q: Name an African-American pioneer who made an impact on you (and why?) Corbin: The African-American who made an impact on me was Constance Baker Motley, who was an activist, lawyer, judge, government official and Civil Rights activist, because when I started my academic pursuit in college I wanted to be an attorney. I once read that she felt that the most difficult occupation to break into was the legal profession. Ms. Motley pursued legal studies of which I admired a great deal for an African American woman to undertake during that time. She was a legal advocate in the Civil Rights Movement and became the first female African-American federal judge in 1966. She worked with Thurgood Marshall and also represented Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Q: What impact did attending an HBCU have on your life? Corbin: The impact of attending an HBCU is one that has given me many rewarding life-long opportunities to be determined and purpose driven. I was nurtured in a supportive atmosphere that allowed me to grow academically amongst like-minded peers to become successful. Additionally, it created a path for me to continually give back to others, especially serving the African American Community. The NBA Referees currently partner with Scholastic Books, which enables us to participate in a monthly reading program for middle school children reading them stories and I participate in that initiative. HBCU Referees Series: Derrick Stafford: Morehouse College Karl Lane, Philander Smith College Q: Why did you decide to attend an HBCU? Corbin: Attending an HBCU was a way to continue a family tradition as my mother graduated from an HBCU, I met my wife and we both graduated from the same HBCU with pride and our son continues our family legacy as a student athlete at an HBCU playing baseball. Q: Nine out of 65 NBA Referees attended HBCUs. How important is that bond? Corbin: The bond is of huge importance to us, as we all possess the unique cultural experience of attending an HBCU where we were a part of an atmosphere of community and collaboration among the student body, professors and faculty from diverse backgrounds. Q: What was the best piece of advice someone gave you during college? Corbin: One of my college professors, Dr. Mosley, once said \u201cWork hard so you can play twice as hard\u201d and that stuck with me as I understood what he was emphasizing during that particular class lecture, which was the importance to strive for our very best academically so that we may enjoy the rich rewards of our hard work later down the road. Q: Who is a mentor that made the biggest impact on you during college? Corbin: The mentor who made the greatest impact in my life during my time in college was Douglas Robertson, a Coppin State University alumni. Douglas was an influential figure in my collegiate years as well as my personal life. He still remains a constant and positive part of my life and the life of my family."},{"id":41635,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-chicago-bulls-undergo-role-reversal-playoff-chase","date":"2018-02-23","title":"Philadelphia 76ers, Chicago Bulls finding their way after reversal of usual roles","content":" A Hollywood movie played out at United Center Thursday night, one of those cheesy comedies in which two characters accidentally bump into each, suffer a \u201cfreak accident\u201d and switch personalities. For a night, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Chicago Bulls starred in roles previously played by Steve Martin-Lily Tomlin, Jason Bateman-Ryan Reynolds, Lindsay Lohan-Jamie Lee Curtis and many others. The Sixers, a team so dedicated to losing in recent seasons that they gave it a wink-wink name (\u201cThe Process\u201d), were the ones facing expectations and some pressure. With teams clustered tightly in the Eastern Conference standings \u2014 the third-place Cavaliers (34-23) and eighth-place Heat (30-28) were separated by just 4 1\/2 games by night\u2019s end, with the Washington Wizards, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks and 76ers in between \u2013 they knew a post-All Star sprint through what\u2019s left of the schedule could make all the difference in first-round matchups. Just that word, \u201cpostseason,\u201d is bright, shiny and maybe a little scary for Philadelphia. This is a team that lost 199 times from 2013-14 through 2015-16, forever tainting coach Brett Brown\u2019s W-L record while racing to the league\u2019s bottom to draft Joel Embiid ( third pick overall, 2014 ), Jahlil Okafor ( third, 2015 ) and Ben Simmons ( first, 2016 ). Injuries, particularly those suffered by Embiid (31 games in 2016-17) and Simmons (missed \u201916-17 season), meant bonus \u201cProcess\u201d last season, as did the Sixers sorting out the future whereabouts of Okafor and Nerlens Noel ( third overall, 2013 ). But now the stakes are real, the goals are tangible, the regular season\u2019s final two months mean a ton. \u201cThere is a mentality, this final third of this season in relation to, how do you prepare to play in the playoffs?\u201d Brown said of his evolving chore. \u201cThat level of detail, that level of focus, that level of commitment gets raised \u2014 the bar is raised. Trying to make people hyper-aware of what could be around the corner.\u201d Asked how his organization managed to maintain its firewall between the \u201cProcess\u201d and the locker room, Sixers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo said Thursday: \u201cI don\u2019t think the players ever stopped seeing the light at the end.\u201d For a team like Chicago \u2014 which averaged more victories (51) in a recent five-season span than Philly totaled in three (47) \u2014 that light currently is an oncoming train. Around the next corner is yet another corner, at least for the foreseeable future. Seven teams reached the All-Star break with fewer than 20 victories, and the Bulls were not among them . In this final season before Draft lottery odds get further flattened , stiffer orders from the team\u2019s front office came down this week: Changes would be made. Specifically, that meant benching two veteran players \u2014 center Robin Lopez and wing Justin Holiday \u2014 whose talents helped key Chicago\u2019s 10-6 record in December . Now Bulls fans will get a heavy diet of Cristiano Felicio, Cameron Payne and David Nwaba in the rotation, under the guise of poking and prodding what talent they do or don\u2019t possess. Such are the inexactitudes of, er, winning-by-losing (that \u201cT\u201d word is too expensive to use) that Nwaba nearly torpedoed the reaffirmed plan as it began. The poor man\u2019s Dwyane Wade \u2014 that\u2019s my comp and I\u2019m sticking it \u2014 scored a career-high 21 points with nine rebounds as Chicago nearly messed up both teams\u2019 nights before a timely collapse in a 116-115 loss. The sturdy 6-foot-4 journeyman has a chance to become the Bulls\u2019 version of Robert Covington or T.J. McConnell, a fringe guy signed as a placeholder who earns a legit spot. The Bulls have enough talent in the yield of the Jimmy Butler trade \u2014 rookie stretch-four Lauri Markkanen, wing Zach LaVine and point guard Kris Dunn \u2014 along with forward\/center Bobby Portis (38 points) and Nwaba to make losing difficult over the 24 games remaining. Sitting out good soldiers such as Lopez and Holiday wasn\u2019t a pillar of Philly\u2019s (cough) systematic rebuild. Fortunately for those asked to take three steps back before taking one forward, human memory is kind. Nightly anguish recedes. Yesterday yields to today and tomorrow. \u201cWhen I look in the rear-view mirror, it\u2019s not as painful as people make it out to be,\u201d Brown said. \u201cLosing stinks, and the pain of losing is real. But the things that went into growing young players was really enjoyable for me. \u201cThe development of young guys, giving them opportunities, explaining life in the NBA and what it takes to stay in the NBA, building a culture, stuff that nobody sees when it\u2019s 48 minutes in front of 20,000 people, the underbelly of what it means to grow a culture and raise the bar, interest me a lot,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was 36 years old. I\u2019d coached a long time. I\u2019d been privileged to see championships and all that, [so] for me personally that challenge interested me a lot and kept me going.\u201d Brown is more likely now to be crushed by a blown lead or a narrow defeat, because it represents lost opportunity. He has talked extensively with Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg to help him cope along the long, dreary path Chicago\u2019s management has staked out. Relationships and player development, Brown said, are the two realms in which Hoiberg should bury himself. But as far as shrugging away losses and the kindness of Brown\u2019s \u201crear-view mirror,\u201d Colangelo could only smile. Said the Sixers exec: \u201cHe said that with a straight face, huh?\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Best team. Best narrative. Those are the three components that give James Harden his best shot at ending his personal Kia MVP curse. An MVP runner-up in two of the past three seasons , Harden has the Houston Rockets in a prime position to potentially dethrone the Golden State Warriors for the top spot in the Western Conference playoff chase. He\u2019s also in control of his own fate in the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, sitting atop the heap coming out of NBA All-Star 2018 with nothing but time and momentum on his side. With the Rockets just 25 games away from the end of the regular season, there might not be enough time for LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry or anyone else to catch Harden. And since the Rockets went into the break riding the wave of a 10-game win streak , serving notice that they have no plans of vacating their position at the front of the line of the league\u2019s elite. Harden averaged 32.5 points, 8.8 assists, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 steps during that streak, maintaining his edge on the Kia MVP crowd heading into the break. * Schuhmann:  Breaking down chase for No. 1 in West But as he said in Los Angeles during All-Star weekend, there is no rushing this process, no skipping any steps on the way to what could be the biggest postseason of his career, both individually and for the Rockets. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not anxious,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take one game at a time. We\u2019re going to continue to get better on both ends of the floor. Offensively we\u2019re number two. Defensively I think we\u2019re seven or something. So we can get better that way. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to try to build, build every single year, get better every single game, get better, try to incorporate Joe [Johnson] and Brandan [Wright] into what we\u2019ve been doing. Just prepare ourselves for the postseason.\u201d First, however, comes the chase for that No. 1 spot the Warriors have owned the past three seasons. Harden and the Rockers already took the season series, 2-1, giving them the tie-breaker over the reigning NBA champs. Maintaining that No. 1 spot, that\u2019s the first order of business for Harden and the Rockets, the first and most important step for so many reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to take it one game at a time and try to be the best we can be.\u201d That makes the metric rather rudimentary for Harden and his case for that elusive hardware he\u2019s been hunting. Best player. Best team. Best narrative. Kia MVP? * * * The top five in the Week 19 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.3 points, 9.0 assists, 5.1 rebounds The directive for Harden and the Rockets over the final 25 games of the regular season is clear: hold on to that No. 1 spot in the Western Conference playoff chase \u2026 by any means necessary. It\u2019s easy for Houston to get ahead of itself and start daydreaming about hosting the Western Conference finals and having home-court advantage throughout the postseason. But the Rockets have to get their first. And they\u2019ll do that with Harden at the forefront (and Chris Paul right beside him), leading the way. Harden has been spectacular all season, particularly in during the Rockets\u2019 10-game win streak. His understanding of when to press the issue himself and when to involve the members of his improved supporting cast has been spot on all season. When Paul was out, he built confidence in the rest of the group and the Rockets have been virtually unstoppable with Harden, Paul and Clint Capela in the lineup together . Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  26.5 points, 8.9 assists, 8.1 rebounds Now that the new-look, rejuvenated Cavaliers have finally lost a game ( Thursday night at home vs. the Wizards ), they can finally get down to the nuts-and-bolts business of figuring each other out. Simply put, they cannot have finishes like they did against Washington, where LeBron scores the final nine points and the rest of the Cavaliers go 0-for-10. That kind of performance won\u2019t help Cleveland become the favorite in the Eastern Conference. That said, LeBron has made it clear that he\u2019s going to play at the highest level in what could very well be his final months in a Cavaliers uniform. His energy and effort going into All-Star weekend was cranked up to its highest levels. And he didn\u2019t disappoint in LA, winning his third Kia NBA All-Star MVP award . But now comes the real heavy lifting. The Cavaliers have a limited amount of time to figure it all out before the playoffs hit. And they still have to reintegrate Kevin Love with his new teammates. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.0 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists Durant teamed up with LeBron James to beat his fellow Warriors-turned-All-Stars on Sunday in Los Angeles , earning bragging rights over Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green until they choose sides next year in Charlotte. But he was back with his crew Thursday night, joining with his regular crew to kick off the stretch run of this regular season with a critical win over the LA Clippers . (Every win is critical now for Golden State, given the dogfight they\u2019re in with Houston for No. 1 in the West.) Durant\u2019s 24 points, eight assists, three rebounds and two blocks against the Clippers didn\u2019t shine like his 50-point effort in the Warriors\u2019 last outing before All-Star weekend , a loss to Portland. But his reduced numbers were much more impactful in a winning effort as the Warriors erased their half-game deficit to the Rockets in the standings \u2014 for a day at least. Durant has been here before, playing on a team jockeying for playoff positioning in the season\u2019s final weeks. He should have no problem shifting into high gear with so much on the line every night. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  26.6 points, 6.5 assists, 5.2 rebounds Curry rebounded the way you\u2019d expect a two-time Kia MVP to respond after struggling, by his standard, in the weeks leading up to his 44-point, 10-assists, six-rebound, two-steal showcase Thursday in a win against the LA Clippers. In the eight games before that, Curry didn\u2019t reach his season scoring average for eight straight games. He shot his way out of that funk against the Clippers, though, reminding the world that he\u2019s capable of stretching the floor in ways no one else in the league can. He drained eight of his 11 shots from beyond the 3-point line, including a shot from just inside half court . The Warriors needed everything he provided to hold off the Clippers\u2019 late charge. Curry and the Warriors are in unfamiliar territory these days, battling for the No. 1 spot in the West for the first time since ascending to the championship-level stage. This fight for the top spot is on. Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  23.7 points, 5.2 assists, 3.9 rebounds This is a new role for DeRozan (best player) and a new role for the Raptors (best team in the Eastern Conference standings) as NBA All-Star weekend closed. Now we get to see how DeRozan and the Raptors handle being in the lead position. DeRozan\u2019s game has matured nicely with the changes to the system coach Dwane Casey has implemented . Finding a way to fend off the Boston Celtics, and perhaps the Cavs, though, will require DeRozan and fellow All-Star Kyle Lowry to unleash their leadership skills. They\u2019ve both learned when to defer to one another and when to lean on their supporting cast. But DeRozan will need to assert himself and be prepared to be much more aggressive offensively to keep the Raptors atop the East. He\u2019ll need to play the same way he did in December and January , when he was scoring 25-plus points per game and shooting better than 44 percent, after seeing those figures dip to 19.1 ppg and 40.4 percent this month . 6. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 7. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 8. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 9. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves 10. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers And five more \u2026: Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers An inside look at Tomas Satoransky from an Eastern Conference executive: \u201cI know John Wall hates to hear this, but with Satoranksy running the point the way he did [Thursday night] in Cleveland, the Wizards really do move the ball differently. They\u2019re much more liberal with the ball in terms of who gets the shots, where the ball goes and when, and honestly it\u2019s a much more democratic approach than when John is out there. I\u2019m not here to denigrate John. He\u2019s a great player, an absolute great player and obviously one of the best point guards, one of the best players in our league. Satorasnky is not close to that level. But sometimes you get a fresh set of eyes, some new hands on the controls, and he just drives the offense in his own way. He\u2019s clever and still very deliberate at the same time. John\u2019s been around for so long, you know his habits, his tendencies, but you can\u2019t stop him. He\u2019s that good. Satorasnky isn\u2019t even really a point guard. But [Wizards coach] Scott Brooks has to love what he\u2019s seeing from him. \u201cHe\u2019s a natural playmaker, that\u2019s clear to everyone who has seen him now that he\u2019s playing bigger minutes and with different rotations. I\u2019m not sure they knew what to do with him otherwise. John\u2019s injury might have allowed them to get another chance to experiment with him and see what he could do. That length and that soft shooting touch are working for him. Scott can keep his jumbo backcourt out there with he and Bradley Beal and then you can go with completely different rotations late with the game on the line. But they\u2019ve stumbled onto a really nice wrinkle with Satoransky and now you know what you can do with him if he\u2019s pressed into service as your starting point guard. He\u2019s got some great instincts and you can work him at any one of three different positions. The Wizards are really playing well, too. They\u2019re averaging 30 assists over their last 10 games, just sharing the ball offensively and playing the way you want your team to play. Like I said, John Wall might not like it, but everybody does eat when the Wizards play this way.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The league\u2019s reigning Kia Most Valuable Player stepped up to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. Russell Westbrook\u2019s flick of a 3-pointer as time expired lifted Oklahoma City to a 110-107 win at Sacramento, a victory they very much needed in a crowded Western Conference. DIFFICULTY: Even one dribble might have taken too much of the 0.7 seconds remaining. Westbrook knew that, and opted for the catch-and-shoot. Luckily for him, his defender gave him enough of a cushion to do just that. As a result, Westbrook had a clean look at the rim from beyond the arc. That was all he needed. GAME SITUATION: The Thunder led by 22 points after the first quarter. The wheels completely fell off after that as the Kings stormed back to take the lead in the second half. Such a loss would have been demoralizing, making Westbrook\u2019s heroics more of a relief than a triumph. CELEBRATION: If you like a healthy mix of \u201cno\u201d and groans, this was the game for you. Kings fans hadn\u2019t seen their club beat an above-.500 team in Sacramento since Jan. 6. Their disappointment was palpable. As for the Thunder, Westbrook was mobbed by the bench players while his fellow starters simply smiled in happy relief. GRADE: As fantastic as Westbrook\u2019s heroics were, the Thunder should not have needed them in the first place. Entering Thursday night\u2019s slate, just three games separated the third and ninth-place teams out West. They nearly gave up a 20-point lead to a lottery-bound club. That didn\u2019t happen because Westbrook got a clear look for the win. They escaped a sloppy contest in dramatic fashion, but all that matters to Oklahoma City is the all-important \u201cW.\u201d Two-and-a-half Horrys .

Commissioner Adam Silver sent a memo to teams Thursday detailing plans for the hotline and asking them to review their respect in the workplace policies. The memo states that \u201crespect and integrity are core NBA values, and we all must work to ensure that they are reflected in the culture and workplaces of our organizations.\u201d The memo, obtained by The Associated Press and other organizations, asks teams to complete their review of their policies by March 6. The hotline will allow employees to report concerns \u201cincluding but not limited to sexual harassment, illegality, or other misconduct,\u201d the memo stated. It also stated that league office employees were told in December about plans to conduct mandatory, small-group discussions facilitated by outside experts to ensure a full understanding of issues related to sexual harassment and expectations for to behave in the workplace. In the memo, Silver encourages teams to implement the same program in their organizations. The SI story this week detailed allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct by former Mavericks President Terdema Ussery, and said team website reporter Earl Sneed was twice accused of domestic assault while working for the Mavericks. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told the magazine he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d and that it needs to be fixed. The Mavericks have hired Evan Krutoy and Anne Milgram to lead the independent investigation.

I\u2019ve been wearing 22 my whole life and to get to wear it for the Cleveland Cavaliers is beyond a dream come true.\u201d Nance Jr. will begin wearing No. 22 next week. For now, he\u2019ll be in No. 24, the number he chose after he was obtained from the Lakers. When he was traded, Nance Jr. considered how special it would be to wear his dad\u2019s number, which was retired by the Cavs in 1995 and hangs above Quicken Loans Arena.

Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, Mayor Darrell Steinberg and tourism officials are set to detail plans for the bid for the game in 2022 or \u201923 on Thursday and submit an application to the league Friday. Getting the game would cap a remarkable comeback for Sacramento, which nearly lost its franchise to Seattle in 2013 before Ranadive bought the team and put together a deal to build a state-of-the-art downtown arena. \u201cI think it would be a recognition of the fact that the city went all-in on the Kings,\u201d Ranadive said. \u201cIt would be the ultimate recognition that the city pulled it off. There\u2019s a love affair between the Kings and the city and the NBA. It would be an exclamation point on that love affair.\u201d Winning the bid won\u2019t be easy. The Golden State Warriors want the game for their new arena in downtown San Francisco that is set to open for the 2019-20 season. Milwaukee is also bidding, with its new arena set to open next season. Other cities also will get involved. Commissioner Adam Silver said at the All-Star game last weekend in Los Angeles that he generally supports a bid from Sacramento with one major caveat. \u201cSacramento and the surrounding communities provide a tremendous opportunity for an All-Star. Wine country, great golf, great scenery, all kinds of wonderful things that I think people would love to visit around an All-Star. But at the end of the day, we have to have a sufficient number of hotel rooms,\u201d he said. Ranadive said new projects will ensure the city meets the NBA\u2019s requirement of about 6,000 rooms in the area. But the bid will offer even more options with up to 1,000 rooms through a partnership with Airbnb, as well as two or three 300-room small luxury cruise ships in the Port of Sacramento. Silver said he would be open to that possibility, pointing out that USA Basketball players and guests have used cruise ships for accommodations at the Olympics, including the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cNot only will we meet the requirement but we\u2019ll also give them a choice,\u201d Ranadive said. \u201cDo they want to be on a beautiful river? Do they want to be in a beautiful home? Or do they want to be in a hotel room? All of that will be accessible in less than 30 minutes.\u201d The events surrounding the game will be anchored by the Golden 1 Center, with an indoor-outdoor Global Pavilion near the capitol to host concerts and food events that show off the region. The bid promises to take fans from transportation hubs to accommodations and venues in 30 minutes or less by the use of self-driving vehicles and dedicated traffic lanes. Ranadive believes the arena raised the bar on technology and environmentalism for sports venues. There are \u201csmart turnstiles\u201d that allow fans to enter at more than triple the usual speed and the NBA\u2019s first 4K ultra HD video board that stretches 84 feet long. The arena is the first professional sports venue powered completely by solar energy, saving about 1 million gallons of water a year compared with a typical venue of its size. It was built with recycled material from the mall that stood at the site before construction began and gets 90 percent of its food and beverages from within 150 miles. \u201cI think when we built the arena we had a goal that it would be the best arena that had ever been built,\u201d Ranadive said. \u201cIt would be an iconic structure to look at. It would give the fans an experience like no other. To be able to share that with the entire basketball loving world is obviously a huge privilege and would be a treat for us to do that.\u201d"},{"id":41619,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-major-nba-storylines-final-two-months","date":"2018-02-22","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Storylines to watch after NBA All-Star break","content":"John Schuhmann and Shaun Powell joined me in Los Angeles to discuss the biggest storylines to monitor in the East and West over the final two months of the NBA regular season. * * * Subscribe to the Hang Time podcast on Apple Podcasts or iHeart Radio for new episodes every week this season!"},{"id":41632,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/playoff-race-breakdown-houston-rockets-and-golden-state-warriors","date":"2018-02-22","title":"Playoff race breakdown: Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors chase West's top seed","content":" The Houston Rockets come out of the All-Star break with a one-game lead in the loss column over the Golden State Warriors for the top seed in the Western Conference. The Rockets have already won the tiebreaker, thanks to two wins in the three head-to-head meetings (with none remaining). So, can the Rockets hold onto the top seed and have *home-court advantage throughout the playoffs? Lets break it down \u2026 * Assuming the West\u2019s No. 1 seed finishes with a better record than the East\u2019s No. 1 seed. Sometimes, a team\u2019s record can be deceiving. For instance, thanks to some bad luck in close games, the Dallas Mavericks are better than their record. They\u2019re 18-40 with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 24-34. The Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings, teams that have lost a lot of blowouts, are on the other end of the spectrum, with point differentials that say they should have 12 wins instead of 18. The point differentials of the Rockets and Warriors pretty closely match their records. Both teams have 44 wins and a point differential that says they should have 45. But if you take their records and their point differentials and project them over the final seven weeks of the season (ignoring strength of schedule), the Rockets would finish with a record of 64-18 and the Warriors would finish with a record of 62-20. The Rockets went into the break with a 10-game winning streak and a 17-2 record over the last six weeks, ranking third offensively and seventh defensively over that stretch. Over the same six weeks, the Warriors had the league\u2019s best offense, but went 12-6 and ranked 16th defensively. The Rockets are 28-1 with Chris Paul, James Harden and Clint Capela . Both Harden and Luc Mbah a Moute (Houston\u2019s best defender) missed their loss to the Warriors (who were playing without Kevin Durant) on Jan. 4 . Warriors coach Steve Kerr has made it clear that his team was fatigued over the last few weeks and needed the All-Star break. Time will tell if he was right, or if the wear and tear of three straight trips to The Finals affects their defense going forward. Both of these teams can beat any other team in the league. In fact, in games played between the 18 teams that are currently over .500 , the Warriors (25-10) and Rockets (22-9) have the two best records. But those games account for 19 of their 27 losses. So schedule strength matters going forward. And going forward, the Warriors have an easier schedule than the Rockets. The champs will play only 14 of their final 24 games against teams that currently have winning records. The Rockets play 18 of their final 25 games, including 13 of their next 14, against that group. Outside Houston and Golden State, there are five teams that are at least 10 games over .500 . The Rockets have twice as many games remaining against those five teams (six) as the Warriors do (three). The Rockets also have a tougher schedule in regard to rest. They have only two remaining games where they\u2019ll have a rest advantage (where they didn\u2019t play the day before, but their opponent did), but five remaining games, including Monday\u2019s visit to Utah, where they\u2019ll be at a disadvantage (playing the second game of a back-to-back against an opponent that didn\u2019t play the day before). The Warriors\u2019 schedule is even in that regard (four games of each). The Rockets\u2019 first two post-break games \u2014 vs. Minnesota and at Denver \u2014 end a stretch where they\u2019re playing eight of nine against the league\u2019s bottom 10 defenses . Going forward, they have more games than the Warriors against both top-10 defenses and top-10 offenses . Put it all together and the Warriors have the easiest remaining schedule in the Western Conference, while the Rockets have the seventh toughest. That could be the difference in regard to home-court advantage in a potential conference finals matchup. As noted above, the Rockets have the tiebreaker, having won the head-to-head series, 2-1. Looking across at the Eastern Conference, the 41-16 Toronto Raptors are the only team with a legit chance of matching the record of either Houston or Golden State to have home-court advantage in The Finals. The Rockets lost their first meeting with the Raptors (in Houston) and will play them again in Toronto on March 9. If the Rockets were to win that game, they\u2019d have a big advantage for the next Finals tiebreaker: record vs. the opposite conference. The Warriors won both of their meetings with the Raptors and would have the tiebreaker should they finish with the same record as Toronto. If the Rockets had home-court advantage in the Western Conference finals, would they be a favorite over the defending champs? If the Warriors had home-court advantage, would they be a lock for their fourth straight trip to The Finals? The answer to both questions is \u201cnot necessarily,\u201d because we\u2019re talking about the two best road teams in the league. The Rockets and Warriors have outscored their opponents by 8.5 and 8.3 points per 100 possessions, respectively, on the road. Those are the league\u2019s two best road point differentials by a wide margin . Both the Rockets and Warriors have won a game in the other team\u2019s building this season. The Rockets won at Golden State on opening night and the Warriors won in Houston on Jan. 4 . The Warriors have been the stronger team at home (plus-11.9 points per 100 possessions vs. plus-8.7), but home success in the regular season doesn\u2019t necessarily portend the same in the playoffs. The team with the best home record of the last 20 years \u2014 the 2015-16 Spurs, who went 40-1 at the AT&T Center \u2014 lost two of its three home games (to Oklahoma City) in the 2016 conference semifinals . That same season, the Warriors went 39-2 at Oracle Arena in the regular season and became the first team since 1978 to lose Game 7 of The Finals at home . In three postseasons under Steve Kerr, the Warriors are 18-10 on the road and have won at least one road game in all 12 series they\u2019ve played. In those same three postseasons, the Rockets are 4-12 on the road. Both teams will begin their post-break schedule on national TV against Western Conference teams with winning records. The Warriors will host the LA Clippers on Thursday ( 10:30 p.m. ET ), the second game of TNT\u2019s double-header. The Rockets will host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday ( 8 p.m. ET ), the first game of ESPN\u2019s double-header. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Nance competed in last weekend\u2019s Verizon All-Star dunk contest , an event he turned into an unforgettable family affair by wearing his dad\u2019s Phoenix jersey and replicating the same dunk Larry Nance Sr. did while winning the inaugural dunk contest in 1984. The younger Nance finished second to Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell, but that diminish memories he\u2019ll forever cherish. \u201cThe dunk contest was a blast,\u201d Nance said. \u201cIf anybody had to win, Don did awesome so I\u2019m happy for him. At the same time those are moments that I don\u2019t know if any father and son has ever had. That\u2019s the coolest part of it all and I\u2019m already having several pictures blown up to be framed and stuff like that.\u201d On Wednesday, Nance and the other new Cavs took part in their first practice at the team\u2019s facility since the trades. And while there was a lot for the foursome to cram in \u2013 photo sessions, media interviews \u2013 before Thursday\u2019s game against Washington, it was also a chance for a refresher course on what they learned before the All-Star break. \u201cJust like how I suspected, they forgot the plays,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said with a laugh. \u201cSo, we grabbed them early, tried it, and then we\u2019re going to grab them again after the shooting and just continue to keep going through the plays and a couple defensive coverages.\u201d There\u2019s a lot for the new Cavs to digest and it\u2019s vital they pick things up quickly. Cleveland is 2-0 with its recent additions, getting impressive road wins at Boston and Oklahoma City . The Cavs played with a renewed energy and purpose in those two games with the performances giving the team a much needed jolt following weeks of turmoil. Currently third in the Eastern Conference, the Cavs are heading into a brutal stretch of 17 games in 32 days, which will require Lue and his staff to do all they can to get the new players ready for the postseason. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to use shootarounds as practice time to teach and for guys to get better,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a lot of off days now. When we play every other day, we take off, we\u2019re not going to be able to do that now, especially the new guys. Just got to be smart about it so guys get their rest, but also make sure we\u2019re teaching and letting guys come in so they\u2019ll be able to pick up what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d In the meantime, Nance was looking forward to taking the court in Cleveland, where his father\u2019s retired No. 22 hangs from the rafters. There has been speculation that he might ask the Cavs to let him wear the number, but that\u2019s been put on hold. \u201cI\u2019m 24 right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will revisit it in the summer, but with everything that happened so fast I wasn\u2019t about to go to Cavs management say, \u2018Hey what would you think about taking 22 down?\u2019 But I don\u2019t want to see it come down. If there is some way where I could even drop the \u2018Jr.\u2019 off my jersey and wear the \u2018Nance\u2019 No. 22 I\u2019d love to keep it up there.

That was too brutal for me.\u201d The Mavericks dumped veterans Deron Williams and Andrew Bogut around the trading deadline last season and had their highest draft pick (No. 9) since ending up with Dirk Nowitzki from that spot in 1998. They drafted rookie point guard Dennis Smith Jr., one of the league\u2019s rising stars. After trading veteran guard Devin Harris to Denver at the deadline this season, Dallas (18-40) is tied for the fewest wins in the NBA and among seven teams with 18 or 19 victories at the All-Star break.

In celebration of Black History Month, we explore the unique bond that these officials have with one another and the impact that attending an HBCU had on their personal and professional lives. We open our series with Derrick Stafford, who graduated from Morehouse College in 1978. Stafford is in his 31st season as an NBA referee and entered the 2017-18 campaign with 1,670 regular season, 166 playoff and 12 Finals games to his credit. Stafford was a two-sport athlete at Morehouse, playing football for two years and baseball for four, earning All-Conference honors in baseball three times. Q: Nine out of 65 NBA Referees attended HBCUs. How important is that bond? Stafford: I knew there were a few guys that had gone to HBCUs but I didn\u2019t realize it was exactly nine. There is a bond between guys that all went to similar type schools, especially being from the South. Q: Why did you decide to attend an HBCU? Stafford: I was one of the first classes of integration here in Atlanta. So after high school I decided that I would go to a predominately black college because I went to a predominately white high school. My high school was probably 90 percent white when I first attended. So I just wanted to get a feel for something different, being around intelligent black guys all with the same type of goals from different parts of the country \u2014 really they were from everywhere, all of the world, actually. Q: What impact did attending an HBCU have on your life? Stafford: For me in particular, going to Morehouse, it was Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], just seeing his statue out front and learning about his legacy. Actually being from Atlanta and remembering when he was assassinated, that was main thing that I learned, that he was the main leader in my life, as I grew older. Q: Name an African-American pioneer who made an impact on you (and why?) Stafford: Dr. King, Reverend [Joseph] Lowery, Andrew Young, Hosea Williams \u2014 they all had a big impact on my life. I saw the work that they were doing and what they were going through, so it was impactful. Q: What was the best piece of advice someone gave you during college? Stafford: We had this guy named Reverend Daniels, who was our chaplain for the baseball and football team and once I was talking to him about a particular situation and his answer to me was \u2018Whenever you have a problem, always say to yourself what would the master do?\u2019 So by keeping that mindset, it allows me to try to make good decisions in most situations. Q: Who is a mentor that made the biggest impact on you during college? Stafford: My baseball coach, coach Basil Hall and my football coach, coach Michael Gray, they were both very instrumental. They were young, they hadn\u2019t been out of college long themselves and they both went to Morehouse. They had a major impact on me, teaching me discipline, sacrifice, fundamentals and also disappointment and how to deal with it. HBCU Referees Series: S ean Corbin: Coppin State Karl Lane: Philander Smith College Q: Mentoring is something that many referees speak about. How important is mentorship in this profession, both receiving mentorship and being a mentor to others? Stafford: It\u2019s very important. Without the guidance and mentorship of Darell Garretson even before I got hired I certainly would not be the referee that I am today. So I took that based on what he gave me and I try to give it back to other guys. He definitely made it part of our learning process, to understand that we needed to give back and that is part of what we were expected to do. Q:  How important is the celebration of Black History Month not only to you personally, but in society in general? Stafford: I think it\u2019s important that we do set aside \u2014 and I think any nationality should do the same thing \u2014 set aside a particular time where you can kind of reflect on your history and think about the people that helped you get to the point that you are now. I think it\u2019s always good to reflect. Black History Month always makes you sit back and think and it comes at a great time; its in February right after the new year has just started so it\u2019s a good time to reflect going into the new year. I just think all nationalities should look back at their history and be proud of where they came form, accept the mistakes that were made but also be proud of their heritage. But its something that I think living here in the United States it\u2019s just something that\u2019s a part of you and something that you think about and appreciate every day."},{"id":41658,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/joakim-noah-will-not-return-new-york-knicks-coach-jeff-hornacek","date":"2018-02-21","title":"Coach Jeff Hornacek not expecting Joakim Noah to return to New York Knicks","content":" From the sound of things today, the New York Knicks and Joakim Noah won\u2019t be around each other anytime soon.

He had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last February and shoulder surgery last April . In March of 2017, he was suspended 20 games by the NBA for violating the league\u2019s anti-drug policy .

The bench is a major question mark at present, with Shawn Livingston not looking\/playing like himself, and Andre Iguodala unable to hit the broad side of a barn. Maybe both of them are pacing themselves for the playoffs and it won\u2019t matter in June, but right now, Golden State looks like it will have to ride its starters major minutes \u2014 always a gamble \u2014 in the postseason. I don\u2019t see a Warriors\u2019 defensive lineup, even one with KD at center, that can dramatically limit Houston\u2019s offense. Now, it\u2019s true Golden State could still outscore Houston; Luc Mbah a Moute and\/or P.J. Tucker are going to have to prove they can make shots in the playoffs, though Joe Johnson\u2019s presence will ameliorate that need somewhat. But the Warriors\u2019 margin for error is smaller than it\u2019s ever been since Steve Kerr took the gig. Steve Aschburner :  True. But that\u2019s only relative to how invulnerable they looked from the 2014-15 season till now. Golden State\u2019s run has been remarkable and surely exhausting, both physically and mentally. There\u2019s been slippage in focus and slippage defensively, with what looked for much of the season like an increased edginess. But the Warriors can hit the reset button now and, in my opinion, remain prohibitive favorites to win the NBA championship. Whoever puts them out \u2013 from Houston to the eventual East representative \u2013 is going to earn it. I still just see green rocks, no Kryptonite in sight . Tas Melas :  False. During the 2015 playoffs, in the Western Conference semifinals, the Memphis Grizzlies lead the Warriors 2-1 . I remember TNT\u2019s Ernie Johnson coming over to me and asking: \u201cWho\u2019s winning the title?\u201d At that point, I had no idea if the 67-win Warriors could come back. My answer was, \u201cWhoever wins this series,\u201d but Memphis looked to be in total control before that very important Game 4. Important because Game 4 is where the Warriors found themselves, and at this point, they have not lost what they found. Vulnerable? No. Slightly bored? Yes. (And if I cheated by picking a playoff moment, I cannot help a good name drop.) Shaun Powell :  Actually, the Warriors look more bored than ever in the last four years. I\u2019m not buying the vulnerability stuff. I just think there\u2019s no regular-season urgency with a team that\u2019s still stacked and built to last through June. We can nitpick and say Nick Young has vaporized a bit and say Andre Iguodala is slowly becoming a corpse before our very eyes (although he\u2019s saving himself for The Finals, like every year, where he earns his money). They still have what it takes, by far, to win a title than anyone else. They still have Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and all the rest. John Schuhmann :  False, because they didn\u2019t have Kevin Durant in the first two seasons under Steve Kerr. Their defense has not been up to their standards over the last couple of months, and we\u2019ll soon learn soon enough if they just needed the All-Star break to start defending at an elite level again. The Houston Rockets are better than any team they faced last season, with an offense that\u2019s been nearly as potent as that of the Warriors and a lot of versatility beyond their star guards. But the champs still have the ability to be both the league\u2019s best offensive team and its best defensive team when they\u2019re locked in. They remain a better team than they were without Durant, and we shouldn\u2019t forget how close they were to losing to Durant\u2019s team two years ago. It took an amazing performance from Klay Thompson in Game 6 vs. Oklahoma City in 2016 to save them, and then they couldn\u2019t finish the job in The Finals .  Sekou Smith :  False. I remember the looks on their faces when they trailed the Oklahoma City Thunder 3-1 in 2016 and appeared to be on the brink of elimination in the Western Conference finals \u2014 before Klay Thompson went nuclear to save them. That\u2019s what vulnerable looks like. What they are right now is a team that simply seems exhausted with the process after trying to grind its way back to The Finals for a fourth straight season. They\u2019re mentally and emotionally exhausted more than anything. The focus required to do what the Warriors have done over the past four seasons is tremendously taxing on the body and the mind, and it\u2019s showing right now in their performance. But they have the rest of this regular season and the playoffs to find whatever spark they need to rejuvenate themselves. And I don\u2019t doubt that they will do exactly that."},{"id":41660,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-thoughts-televising-2019-nba-all-star-draft-how-when","date":"2018-02-21","title":"Blogtable: How would you handle televising 2019 NBA All-Star draft?","content":" * * * NBA commissioner Adam Silver says the next All-Star draft will likely be televised . To make for the best television, that draft should take place when, where and how?  * * * David Aldridge :  I\u2019d do it on Saturday night, between the three-point contest and the Dunk contest (though I\u2019d also reverse the order of the dunk contest and the three-point contest so the latter was the final event of the evening). Have LeBron James and Stephen Curry or whoever the captains are next year come out in their warmups and have the 22 other All-Stars along the sidelines or baseline. As each player is chosen, the captain has to explain why he picked the player or why he didn\u2019t pick another player (one question only, not both). The chosen player is then asked his reaction. As I wrote a few weeks ago in the Morning Tip , I\u2019d also give fans an opportunity to text in their prediction for who the next player chosen will be. Fans who pick the right player would automatically be entered into a drawing, with one winner chosen who\u2019d receive four tickets and airfare to the following year\u2019s All-Star game. And on and on and on until \u201cMr. Irrelevant\u201d \u2014 the last All-Star \u2014 goes to one of the teams by default. I would also add one \u201cwild card\u201d that could be used by any chosen player during the draft, in which the player could \u2014 verbally \u2014 opt to PLAY FOR THE OTHER TEAM!! Can you imagine how much fun that would be? Steve Aschburner :  Ninety minutes before tipoff, center court, Spectrum Center in Charlotte . You want to go playground style, then do it the way it\u2019s done on the playground: on the spot, immediately before playing. All the cameras would be in place to capture all the angles and reactions. Have two full sets of jerseys ready for players to don, according to squad. And hope the last man picked plays for the next couple hours with a huge chip on his shoulder, sparking highlights and even greatness. (If 90 minutes isn\u2019t enough for the two All-Star coaches to prep their teams, hold this the night before as one of All-Star Saturday\u2019s events. Then the teams could install a few plays during a morning walk-through.) Tas Melas :  On the court, before the game. Imagine the ratings! This format ensures all players are present and that the fires which are created by the picking order are burning their hottest. People will tune in, the guys\u2019 competitive juices will be flowin\u2019, and because Nike will have to produce each player\u2019s jersey for both teams, the NBA can sell \u2018error uniforms.\u2019 Shaun Powell :  No need to complicate this. Just put the captains on a remote feed, have them choose sides on a 30-minute \u201cInside The NBA\u201d special , have Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal poke fun or applaud the picks, and then give us what we want \u2014 who\u2019s the last player(s) picked? Those players should receive some sort of award, maybe a lifetime pass from ever appearing on Shaqtin a Fool . John Schuhmann :  In the arena, as part of All-Star Saturday Night. The Saturday stuff went by pretty quickly this year, and you can add a half hour between the 3-point contest and the Dunk contest to run the draft. It doesn\u2019t need to be much of a production, just do it playground-style with the captains at center court, picking from the non-captains right there in front of them. It would be much better to do it with everyone there than with the two captains doing it over a video feed with no reactions from the other guys. It\u2019s also an opportunity for everybody to show off their off-court style, you can throw in a fan vote for Best Dressed that gets a guy some money for charity, and the last pick should get some sort of bonus, too.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019m fine with the All-Star draft taking place in the 23 minutes just before tip off. We could replace those exhausting player introductions with the one thing that could really crank up the ratings. Send the captains to center court in Charlotte next year and line the All-Stars up on the baselines and do it the way we all have at one time or another and choose sides. I guarantee you no one will want to miss the spectacle of the who goes where."},{"id":41654,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-lasting-memory-nba-all-star-2018","date":"2018-02-21","title":"Blogtable: Your lasting impression from NBA All-Star 2018?","content":"* * * What is your one lasting impression from NBA All-Star 2018 in Los Angeles?  * * * David Aldridge : A much better All-Star product, both for the TV audience and those at Staples Center, on Sunday. NBA players are not just the best basketball players in the world, they\u2019re among the greatest competitors in any discipline. And that competitiveness was not on display last year. This year, you saw great players giving a damn at the defensive end (and, also, referees who blew their whistles). The last image of Stephen Curry double-teamed on the sideline and unable to get off a last-second shot is a much better visual going forward than players standing woodenly as yet another opponent rose to dunk on them. But it will only last if players continue to put forth some defensive effort next year in Charlotte. Steve Aschburner : The resuscitation of the All-Star Game itself. I\u2019m not convinced the format change or the goosed winner\u2019s share had anything to do with the more conscientious effort, especially on defense. I think there was embarrassment over the 2017 game that wasted everyone\u2019s time and enough conversation about not repeating that mess that it got the players\u2019 attention. Look, however we got there, it was a fine thing. Offensive maneuvers without resistance aren\u2019t nearly as impressive, and ignoring one half of the sport entirely \u2013 defense \u2013 is a lousy way to entertain fans whether rabid or casual. Playing both ends of the floor from the start, throughout the game and particularly at the end demonstrated the All-Stars\u2019 skills and capabilities better than any turnstile fake D ever did. Tas Melas :  The power of LeBron James. LeBron influenced the competitiveness of the All-Star Game by repeatedly saying that the fans deserved more in the weeks leading up to it, and then by imposing his will Sunday. When LBJ speaks, the world listens \u2014 and not only the basketball world. When he fired back at Fox News host Laura Ingraham for saying: \u201cHe should shut up and dribble,\u201d LeBron also empowered those listening to pipe up for what they believe in. L.A. 2018 was peak LeBron transcendence. Shaun Powell :  Mine is the last few frantic possessions of the All-Star Game. We saw bodies on the floor, bodies on Stephen Curry while he tried to launch a desperate shot, bodies on LeBron James as he caught a beautiful pass for the eventual game-winning basket. The impression left by those who played in the game is that \u2026 they cared. Been a long time coming. Let\u2019s hope, for the sake of the reputation of All-Star Weekend, that this becomes the norm and that players don\u2019t need to receive a sign from LeBron to get their butts in gear. John Schuhmann :  Given how embarrassingly noncompetitive the 2017 All-Star Game was, I\u2019ll remember the last five minutes of this one. Of course, when Team Stephen led by 13 with 6:30 to go, I was worried we\u2019d never get anything all that intense. Up to that point, the game was better than last year\u2019s, but not quite competitive enough. Team LeBron\u2019s comeback saved it, and there\u2019s nothing better than the best players in the world playing like they care.  Sekou Smith :  The fact that LeBron James is still dominating the conversation on All-Star weekend some 15 years in is truly remarkable. His impact on the entire affair, from what goes on in the game and all of the storylines he drives off the court is undeniable. I remember when he was just getting started as the young, up-and-coming star who clearly had next after Kobe Bryant and his generation transitioned into the twilight of their careers. So to see LeBron now, the oldest player in Sunday\u2019s game, and still as good as he\u2019s ever been, is something. The All-Star Game ending on a defensive stop, with LeBron, of course, in the middle of the action, says it all. The league\u2019s best player owned the league\u2019s biggest weekend, yet again."},{"id":41659,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dallas-mavericks-launch-probe-workplace-misconduct-allegations","date":"2018-02-21","title":"Dallas Mavericks launch probe to investigate Sports Illustrated report of workplace misconduct","content":"The Dallas Mavericks have hired outside counsel to investigate allegations of inappropriate conduct by former team president Terdema Ussery in a Sports Illustrated report that described a hostile workplace for women. Ussery was accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to several women. He spent 18 years with the team before going to the sports apparel company Under Armour in 2015. Ussery, who was investigated by the team over similar claims in 1998, denied the allegations in a statement to SI. The report said team website reporter Earl Sneed was twice accused of domestic assault while working for the Mavericks, including a guilty plea in a case that was dismissed when he met the conditions of the agreement. The team said Sneed had been fired, and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told SI that he fired human resources director Buddy Pittman after learning details of the magazine\u2019s report. Pittman and Sneed declined to comment to SI. The NBA said the Mavericks had informed the league of the allegations involving Ussery and Sneed. On Tuesday night, the NBA issued the following statement regarding the Sports Illustrated report : Additionally, the Mavericks issued their official statement on the matter as well: SI contacted six female former Mavericks or American Airlines Center employees who claimed they left the sports sector because of a structure that left them feeling vulnerable and devalued while protecting powerful men who misbehaved. A male former department head said there was \u201cbuilt-in protection for a lot of men.\u201d A woman who had recently been hired as a support staffer said Ussery made sexually suggestive remarks to her in the media dining room before a game during the 2010-11 season, when the Mavericks won their only NBA championship. The woman said she had been told by others to be wary of Ussery. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a problem in the Mavericks organization and we\u2019ve got to fix it,\u201d Cuban told the magazine. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, to be honest with you, that it happened under my ownership, and it needs to be fixed.\u201d Two women claimed the Ussery harassed them for years, incidents that ranged from inappropriate remarks to requests for sex to touching women\u2019s calves and thighs during meetings. Ussery had left Nike to join the Mavericks and had previously served as commissioner of the old Continental Basketball Association. He was praised by former NBA Commissioner David Stern and served as the Mavericks\u2019 alternate governor with the league. \u201cI am deeply disappointed that anonymous sources have made such outright false and inflammatory accusations against me,\u201d Ussery said. \u201cDuring my nearly 20-year tenure with the Mavericks, I am not aware of any sexual harassment complaints about me or any findings by the organization that I engaged in inappropriate conduct.\u201d Ussery said he had raised concerns about other Mavericks employees who he said engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct and the organization didn\u2019t address those concerns. \u201cI believe these misleading claims about me are part of an attempt to shift blame for the failure to remove employees who created an uncomfortable and hostile work environment within the Mavericks organization,\u201d Ussery said Cuban told the magazine that the team was establishing a hotline for counseling and support services for past and current employees. He is mandating sensitivity training for all employees, himself included.

Kyle Lowry? \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep doing what we do and not worry about anybody else.\u201d DeMar DeRozan: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d If they sound a bit evasive, it\u2019s not totally due to modesty. Some of it\u2019s due to LeBron James. After all, the Raptors most likely must plow through the superstar who has the East on ownership \u2014 seven straight conference titles \u2014 before they can visualize a trip to the NBA Finals, a place they\u2019ve never been as a franchise. LeBron ended the last two Raptors seasons , sweeping them out of the semifinals last May. That said, Toronto is showing the stuff that\u2019s needed to buy the right to dream. This is a better team on both ends of the floor and the flaws of the past have been significantly reduced. To date, the Raptors are on pace to win nearly 60 games. Gaining home-court advantage \u2014 and the hyped atmosphere at Air Canada Centre \u2014 throughout the East playoffs would be a boost for a team with the best home record in the league. DeRozan is evolving his game to become a more unpredictable offensive threat and Toronto boasts a rotation that\u2019s suddenly deeper and more reliable. Those are the two fresh factors the Raptors can use as proof that they\u2019re bringing something extra and will strengthen their case as, at the very least, LeBron\u2019s biggest threat. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve gone outside and got a superstar free agent,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it organically by growing our young players and the rewarding part was people questioning what we were trying to do. We\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t arrived. But we\u2019ve done it the traditional way. A lot of guys around the league are partnering up, adding superstars, superstars and superstars. We\u2019ve developed players, starting with DeMar.\u201d This is mostly true, with the single exception being the 2017 trade that brought in Serge Ibaka , a much-needed third source on offense. Otherwise, the Raptors are indeed a team that found improvement from within, and that\u2019s a credit to Casey and his coaching staff for growing the crop. DeRozan is now a full-blown star who should get a sprinkling of Kia MVP votes. The game\u2019s master of the mid-range shot , he took only 16 3-pointers as a rookie . He\u2019s at 202 attempts this season , evidence of a growing confidence with his range. He\u2019s a more willing passer who is on pace to rack up a career high in total assists . Lowry is technically an outsider after stops with the Memphis Grizzlies and Houston Rockets, but he became an All-Star after arriving in Toronto in the summer of 2012 . The flow between he and DeRozan is smooth and secure and it\u2019s hard to find a backcourt with better harmony. \u201cNot only are they close, but their families are close,\u201d Casey said. \u201cOne reason they\u2019ve grown close is because of the struggles we had early. They\u2019ve bonded very well together. When Kyle first got to Toronto, they weren\u2019t that close, but they\u2019ve since spent a lot of time during summers and it shows up on the court.\u201d Then there\u2019s the support help, which is young and expanding in all of the right directions. Delon Wright, Fred VanVleet, Jakob Poeltl and Pascal Siakam are all pushing for minutes and doing something with the playing time they get. Wright and Siakam especially are long and limber, bringing the athleticism that works well on defense and on the break. VanVleet is proving more than capable of giving Lowry a breather and is shooting 41.7 percent from deep . Second-year center Poeltl is coming into his own as well. \u201cThose guys have been great, just what we needed,\u201d Lowry said. Offseason addition C.J. Miles is contributing as well, with 10.2 ppg in 18.4 mpg while fortifying the Raptors\u2019 improved 3-point shooting (Toronto is seventh in 3-pointers made after ranking 21st in 2016-17 ). Toronto is a top-five team offensively and defensively and very deliberate with the ball, committing the third-lowest turnovers , proof that they\u2019re much wiser and therefore ready-made for a deep playoff run. \u201cWe just need to work on finishing games better, making sure we stick with what we do,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cWe feel very confident in what we do.\u201d The true measuring stick, of course, is Cleveland, except the Raptors aren\u2019t sure whether the Cavs\u2019 midseason makeover is good or bad for Toronto. Regardless, with all due respect to the Celtics and anyone else who creeps into the conversation between now and April, the Cavs and LeBron are standing in everyone\u2019s way. Some teams are just cursed by bad timing. How many championship dreamers (the Knicks, Heat, etc.) were victimized by Michael Jordan\u2019s prime? The Raptors are good enough to play in The Finals, but the hardest part is getting there (for once). They still wear the scars given by LeBron and they\u2019re not trying to hide them. \u201cWe\u2019re tougher because of what we\u2019ve been through,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cAll the failures, the times we\u2019ve been down \u2026 they\u2019ve brought us closer together. And now that it\u2019s coming together for us, we\u2019re playing for something bigger. As long as we fight for that, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Casey said he thought the Cavs prior to the trade were still the East favorite and admits they might\u2019ve gotten better. \u201cThey\u2019re younger, quicker,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a freshness about them right now. I didn\u2019t think they were broke before this. As long as you have LeBron as your leader, you always have a chance to be good.\u201d The Raptors have won nine of their last 10 and with a decent finish could pull away from the pack. Toronto has two games remaining with the Cavs to get a better sense of what it is up against. The second and final meeting is in April, which is when teams are usually resting players and dialing down until the postseason. Therefore, it\u2019s possible that the Raptors won\u2019t know much about the new Cavs when and if they meet in the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Raptors can keep learning about themselves and seeing if the balance they\u2019ve struck away from the Lowry\/DeRozen backcourt has staying power. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for our organization, what [Raptors chairman] Larry Tanenbaum and [GM] Masai [Ujiri] started,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThat vision is fun to see grow. I think our young core is coming along. People have doubted us in the past and even now, and I\u2019ve should\u2019ve been fired five, six times already. But all the time, we\u2019ve been growing and are still growing. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re done and that this is our ceiling. We can\u2019t be satisfied. We\u2019ve got to stay the hunter and also understand how to play while being the hunted. The great thing is we\u2019re not a finished product. We have to get battle tested and get ready for the playoffs.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

If you scroll down to the bottom of the list, you\u2019ll notice a pair of mainstays from last season reemerge. Let\u2019s see how much staying power they still have. Notes: Season statistics are through games of Feb. 15 Any player who turns 32 during regular season can be added to rankings. Check out previous rankings 1. LeBron James (32), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 26.0 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 11.0 apg Season stats: 26.5 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 8.9 apg James strolled into the All-Star break on a high note, pouring in 24 or more points in four of five games, including a pair of 37-point performances. Not too shabby after beginning the two-week stint with an ugly 11-point showing (3-for-10 shooting) on Feb. 3. The King also managed to chip in a pair of triple-doubles. 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 3 games, 24.7 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 3.7 apg Season stats: 22.4 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.0 apg Despite playing just three games before the break, Aldridge was productive. The big man, who missed the last two games with a minor knee injury, went for 31, 23 and 20 points in the three games while shooting an eye-popping 66.0 percent from the field. Aldridge also strung together three straight games with two blocks. 3. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 19.9 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 7.6 apg Season stats: 19.2 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 8.3 apg Paul moves up a spot on the strength of four 20-plus point games. He also managed to dish out seven or more assists in five consecutive games while pulling down seven or more rebounds in five of seven. Talk about filling the box score. To top it off, he did all this while shooting 53.8 percent from the field. 4. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 14.3 ppg, 11.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Season stats: 15.8 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 1.4 apg It was definitely an up-and-down stint for Howard, who had two games with less than 10 points, one game with just 12 points and four games with 17 or more points. Unfortunately, Howard pulled down just seven rebounds on Feb. 5, breaking a string of 15 straight games with 10 or more rebounds. 5. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 15.2 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 4.6 apg Season stats: 17.7 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 4.0 apg If anyone below him had stood out, Gasol definitely would\u2019ve slipped at least one rung. It was a subpar five-game run for the 7-footer, who has gone five straight games with no more than six rebounds while failing to shoot 50 percent in any of those games. He\u2019s also gone just 5-for-20 from long range. 6. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 14.4 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 3.3 apg Season stats: 16.9 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 3.3 apg Redick rejoins the chase thanks to a relatively strong five-game stretch in which he scored 15 or more points in four of those games. He also hit three or more 3-pointers in four straight, including 5-for-10 on Feb. 10 against the Clippers. After missing seven straight with a leg injury, the veteran shooter appears to be back to full strength. 7. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 13.2 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 0.2 apg Season stats: 17.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.4 apg The stats don\u2019t look good, but they are a bit misleading because of a 6-minute showing on Feb. 6. Anthony injured his ankle during that game and missed the next two games. When he returned, he was solid, scoring 24 and 19. Of course the shooting remains a huge issue: 35.1 FG% over the last two weeks, 41.2 FG% for the season. 8. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 15.7 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 2.1 apg Like Redick, Randolph rejoins the fun. Shooting 53.3 FG% and 45.0 3PT% over the last six games, Randolph scored 14 or more four times. After an inconsistent January in which he went for double-digit scoring in just five of 10 games, Z-Bo has started February with six consecutive double-figure games. 9. Dirk Nowitzki (39), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 15.4 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 12.3 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Nowitzki has gone for 10 or more points in eight straight while shooting better than 50 percent from the field in four of the last six. He\u2019s also connected on two or more 3s in six of the previous eight. Over the last five games, Nowitzki averaged 18.5 points and 65.0 FG% in two wins compared to 13.3 points and 45.2 FG% in three losses. 10. J.R. Smith (32), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 14.0 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 1.5 apg Season stats: 8.5 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 2.0 apg If only we could toss out his Feb. 9 showing in which he went for seven points, Smith would probably check in at No. 8 or 7. That\u2019s because in his other five games, he went for 15 or more three times, hitting three or more 3-pointers in five games.

Charlotte missed on second-round pick Jeffery Taylor from Sweden in 2012. They took Cody Zeller, now a backup center, fourth overall in 2013, Noah Vonleh ninth in 2014 and Frank Kaminsky ninth overall in 2015. Cho drafted Malik Monk in the first round last year, but he barely sees any action for Charlotte because of concerns about his defense.

I love this country and honestly tried my best.\u201d Fergie\u2019s slow, bluesy rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d on Sunday night wasn\u2019t particularly well received at Staples Center or on social media before the 67th edition of the NBA\u2019s annual showcase. A low chuckle rumbled through the sold-out arena after she finished the first line of the song with a throaty growl on \u201cthe dawn\u2019s early light.\u201d Fans throughout the star-studded crowd reacted with varying levels of bemusement and enthusiasm while her languid, 2 +-minute version of the song continued. Although Fergie was on pitch, her tempo, musical accompaniment and sexy delivery were not exactly typical for a sporting event or a patriotic song. Golden State All-Star Draymond Green captured Sunday\u2019s mood \u2013 and became an instant GIF \u2013 when he was shown open-mouthed on the scoreboard and the television broadcast in apparent confusion over the unique vocal stylings. Green then chuckled to himself after realizing he was on TV. After a forceful finish, Fergie finally got big cheers when she shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s play some basketball!\u201d The Black Eyed Peas singer, born Stacy Ann Ferguson, is from nearby Hacienda Heights, California. Famed basketball commentator Charles Barkley joked that he \u201cneeded a cigarette\u201d after Fergie\u2019s performance during the TNT halftime show. Former Lakers star Shaquille O\u2019Neal leaped to Fergie\u2019s defense, saying: \u201cFergie, I love you. It was different. It was sexy. I liked it. Leave her alone.\u201d Others on social media weren\u2019t as kind, with criticism of the performance outpacing the positive reviews. The Forum in nearby Inglewood, California, was the site of arguably the most famous national anthem in sports history during another NBA All-Star Game 35 years ago. Marvin Gaye\u2019s touching rhythm-and-blues version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 1983 game was initially criticized, but has since gained widespread acceptance as a groundbreaking musical performance. Instead, Fergie is more likely to join the long list of curious versions of the anthem, even though she showed far more impressive vocal chops than the likes of Roseanne Barr or Carl Lewis."},{"id":41684,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-all-star-2018-recap-10-best-things-nba-all-star-weekend-2018","date":"2018-02-19","title":"Recapping 10 standout moments from NBA All-Star 2018 weekend","content":" There\u2019s a certain flair and pageantry that gets added to any sporting event when Los Angeles is the host city. When it came to the 2018 NBA All-Star festivities , Hollywood did not disappoint in living up to its standard.  From the arrival of a handful of players late last week to the throng of celebrities, NBA legends and, of course, actual All-Stars on the court for Sunday night\u2019s All-Star Game , big and bold moments marked this All-Star weekend that was. This is by no means the be-all, end-all list for the weekend. But, if you somehow missed them, these 10 moments and events \u2014 listed in no particular order \u2014 will stand out in NBA All-Star lore for years to come: The format change for the 67th All-Star Game , with captains LeBron James and Stephen Curry choosing their rosters, proved to be a rousing success. And the game itself, with its final frantic minutes, were worth all of the hand-wringing. The defense-wins-when-it-matters final seconds living up to all of the promise that accompanied the reset for both the players involved and all of us watching. Team LeBron\u2019s furious 28-12 comeback in the final six minutes made the game an actual, real life competition. Both sides going at it and wanting to win in the worst way is all anyone was asking for \u2014 well that and a televised player draft ( which may be coming soon \u2026 ). First-time All-Stars Bradley Beal (Washington Wizards), Victor Oladipo (Indiana Pacers), Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves) and Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) all acquitted themselves quite well in Sunday night\u2019s game. Embiid stood out among the crowd, though, and might have taken home MVP honors if Team Stephen had held on to their late lead. He gave as good as he got from Team LeBron (see his back and forth with Russell Westbrook early and physical tussles with LeBron late), which is exactly what you expect from The Process. What we can say about Fergie\u2019s soulful rendition of the national anthem that NBA Twitter (and the rest of humankind) haven\u2019t already said? One thing that never gets old during All-Star weekend is seeing the living legends of the game in the flesh, usually in groups and basically everywhere. And from the Legends Brunch to All-Star Saturday Night to Sunday\u2019s game, the stars were out all over Los Angeles. No sport celebrates its rich history better than the NBA.  Anthony Davis represented the the right way for his All-Star New Orleans Pelicans teammate DeMarcus Cousins at the start of the game by wearing Boogie\u2019s No. 0 jersey for Team LeBron . The Big Easy bromance between the superstar big men is real. Friday night\u2019s Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars contest lived up to its billing, as the Boston Celtics\u2019 Jaylen Brown headlined the game filled with some of the league\u2019s most exciting young stars, several of whom could be making appearances on Sunday night in Charlotte next year and Chicago in 2020. As we mentioned, the city of Angels didn\u2019t disappoint as the host for All-Star weekend and this marked the sixth time the league\u2019s showcase event was held here. From the party scene that seemed to stretch all over the Southland to the concentration of stars that made the Staples Center, LA Live and the downtown area the epicenter of the basketball universe for the long weekend, LA delivered. For all of the great shooters who have captured the hardware over the years, none have ever done what Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker did to take home the JBL Three-Point Contest title Saturday night. Booker\u2019s 28 points in his final round duel with Splash Brother and 2016 champion Klay Thompson was an event record. He knocked down a wicked 20 of his 25 shots in that monster final round. The oldest player in Sunday\u2019s game turned out to be the best on and off the court. LeBron James collected his third Kia All-Star Game MVP trophy on the strength of his near triple-double performance (29-points, 10 rebounds and eight assists). Some of his best work came in his response to a battle LeBron and his peers have been fighting all season. \u201cShut up and dribble,\u201d as Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham suggested LeBron and Kevin Durant should do after they dared to discuss social and political issues in our current climate, was met with the ultimate clap back from the face of the league. His nuanced and eloquent words during Saturday\u2019s media day session was the perfect response. If you didn\u2019t know Donovan Mitchell\u2019s name before State Farm All-Star Saturday night, you do now. The Utah Jazz rookie stole the show in the Verizon Slam Dunk contest , introducing himself to the world that doesn\u2019t have NBA League Pass with a masterful performance in the event known for launching new stars. Mitchell\u2019s use of family (his little sister Jordan), newfound friends (comedian Kevin Hart and his son) and history (Jazz dunk champ and legend Darrell Griffith\/a Vince Carter Toronto Raptors jersey) proved timely. Mitchell out-dueled the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 Larry Nance Jr. for the title, securing the title with his ode to Carter on his final dunk. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Two hours later, when he accepted the Kia All-Star MVP trophy, he was barely audible, his throat too scratchy to explain what just happened. Well: To quote an ex-All-Star and noted philosopher Rasheed Wallace, both teams played hard. Those words were never used to describe recent All-Star Games, especially the last two, when defense (196 and 192 points for the winning teams) and the competitive spirit took an extended break, embarrassingly so. The league\u2019s midseason showcase absorbed a rather well-deserved thrashing from fans and even players themselves. Nobody was fooled. Something had to change and someone had to volunteer to be the game-changer. And so, on Sunday, the NBA season took on an 83rd game, as in a real game , thanks to commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s willingness to fix what was broken and LeBron\u2019s desire to set the tone for the most meaningful All-Star Game in years. The players gave the Staples Center crowd the usual acrobatic thrills associated with the game, naturally, but also some spills. As in, bodies on the floor. Every player who checked in did so with a strut and a mission to make a February game feel like June, or close enough, and not just during the close finish, either. Virtually from the start, when LeBron soared and swatted a cross-course pass just minutes into the game, this atmosphere had an edge. As Kevin Durant said: \u201cWe just wanted to change the narrative of the All-Star Game being a joke.\u201d It was Team LeBron 148, Team Stephen 145 in the new format where sides were chosen regardless of conference and captains were assigned by fan vote . This created a new and fresh mix of players, intriguing tandems and raised overall interest for the game. It also helped that prize money, $100,000 to each winning player, was increased and lent a financial incentive. Yet it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if layups went unchecked and jumpers were uncontested. Everything had to fall in line, and everyone had to cooperate. And that\u2019s what led to this, a game decided by defense when it truly mattered, with LeBron and Durant swamping Stephen Curry beyond the 3-point line on the final possession , keeping Curry and his team from getting a potential game-tying shot off as time expired. This is what the NBA needed, a more representative effort and result from the collection of the game\u2019s finest players. It was a much cleaner look and it\u2019s not a stretch to say the format and intensity rescued the All-Star Game from itself. \u201cThe hope is that, as we go forward, it gets even better than this,\u201d said Kyrie Irving. \u201cThe game started to get away and we took it personally.\u201d It\u2019s hardly a surprise that LeBron was the force of change. His 29 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in the win earned him his third Kia All-Star MVP trophy , yet those numbers didn\u2019t accurately reflect how involved he was for four quarters. He lost his voice because of constant yelling and instructing and prodding his teammates to finish the job. He actually influenced both teams; his own by motivating them to play harder, and Team Stephen\u2019s by issuing a challenge. Here\u2019s the final sequence, dictated by LeBron: LeBron encouraged his team to apply a full-court press to end the first half \u2014 has that ever been used in an NBA Game, let alone an All-Star Game? \u2014 and simply took charge throughout. It was a personal mission to keep folks intrigued and interested. This was his game, his tempo, his personality taking over. \u201cI believe I can make an impact and make a difference,\u201d he said. At 33, and winning his first All-Star MVP in a decade , LeBron helped launch a standard that the game badly needed and, if this spirit holds true in the coming years, he\u2019ll serve as the torch-bearer for a new age All-Star Game. Just one more productive layer to his lengthy legacy. \u201cWe all know how great a player he is,\u201d said Team LeBron coach Dwane Casey. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of [Cavs coach Ty Lue] that he has someone like that. But tonight, he was on our team. He\u2019s a joy to coach. He reiterates exactly what should be said, the right things. No BS. In the huddle, defensively, he got the guys jacked up and juiced as far as wanting to get a stop.\u201d There was help; Durant was LeBron\u2019s teammate for the first time in an NBA-sanctioned game and scored 19 points (the two were Olympic teammates in 2012 ). Irving rejoined LeBron after bolting from the Cavs last summer and they connected on the game-winning shot . Paul George was terrific defensively and chipped in 16 points. If not for Team LeBron winning, the MVP could have gone to DeMar DeRozan, who returned to his hometown and dropped 21 points (but threw an errant pass in the final seconds). Or maybe Damian Lillard, who matched DeRozan\u2019s 21. Or Joel Embiid, a first-timer who supplied a big blocked shot right before LeBron\u2019s layup. Therefore, an exhibition game that had grown stale and suffered from lapses and a lack of energy suddenly has a new beginning. East vs. West doesn\u2019t exist anymore, and players purposely feeding a specific player so he can win MVP, and maybe no more matador defense, either, at least not for 48 minutes. It\u2019s a small sample size, and the game must prove itself each year, but this is a push from LeBron and Silver into the right direction. The only possible tweak, perhaps next year, will be with televising the team selection. But that\u2019s a nit-pick. This worked out well. \u201cThe format was great,\u201d James said. \u201cI think the fans did a great job of reacting to it in a positive way. It definitely worked out for everyone., not only for the players, not only for the league, but for the fans, everybody. It was a great weekend and we capped it off the right way.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The reason: that stat only got tracked starting in West\u2019s farewell season. But he racked up No. 82 by stealing the show with his acceptance speech of the NBA\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award presented at the annual All-Star \u201cLegends Brunch\u201d at the L.A. Convention Center. West\u2019s appreciation of NBA history, gratitude for his place in it, optimism for the game\u2019s future and competitive fire all shone through when he stood before the audience filled with both his peers \u2013 some of the greatest players ever \u2013 and fans sampling for the first time one of All-Star Weekend\u2019s most reliable highlights. Three months shy of his 80th birthday, West \u2013 who won one NBA title as a player and eight more as an executive with L.A. and Golden State, and as a consultant now to the Clippers had input into that team\u2019s blockbuster trade of star Blake Griffin \u2013 was one of four former Lakers honored per the brunch program\u2019s tradition of recognizing men associated with the host city.

When there\u2019s things happening in the league, Jerry will tell me exactly what I should know about today\u2019s game and what\u2019s happening with today\u2019s players.\u201d West used some of his time on stage, though, to acknowledge and thank a fifth Los Angeles legend: Hall-of-Famer Elgin Baylor. In fact, he got emotional, pausing to collect himself while praising his former teammate and dear friend, long considered one of the most underrated players in NBA history. Baylor got to the Lakers two years before West, before they left Minneapolis, and was an 11-time All-Star from 1958 to 1971 who still ranks third all-time at 27.4 points per game. \u201cElgin, I won\u2019t ever forget the way you treated me when I came here,\u201d he said to Baylor, who was seated at a nearby table. \u201cAmazing player but more amazing man. I remember when I was in college, never being able to watch the game, no TV, and of course we didn\u2019t have one in my house. But I used to hear about this guy and I thought \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to have a chance to play with him.\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s my hero. I used to watch him practice, I\u2019d watch him out of the corner of my eye. Just the way he conducted himself with people. Just one classy man.\u201d West talked up others in the room whose lives he touched, and both lauded and encouraged current NBA players in their performances and in their commitments off the court. \u201cYou can be leaders because you have a voice. Don\u2019t ever pass that up. Don\u2019t ever lose your voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI really believe in humility. I also believe in civility.\u201d After talking about the NBA\u2019s astounding growth over the run of his equally astounding career, West\u2019s competitiveness flickered through once more. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this \u2013 and I don\u2019t like to say things that are controversial \u2013 but this game is going to overtake all the other sports,\u201d he said. Comedian Billy Crystal, a long-suffering Clippers fan, opened the program with a hoops-themed monologue. \u201cWhen I first started going to Clippers games, there was me, [broadcaster] Ralph Lawler and the players,\u201d Crystal said. \u201cA triple-double meant there were three couples in the stands. \u2026 Watching all of this talent, I was glued to my seat \u2013 because that\u2019s the way the Clippers would keep you from leaving.\u201d Crystal provided some imagery when he likened pro basketball\u2019s legendary stars to great musicians. \u201cWilt in jazz terms was a big band. He was powerful, huge, big brass section,\u201d Crystal said. \u201cThen Elgin came into the league and his style changed the way the game was played. \u2026 He was cool, improvisational jazz. Then came the Big O [Oscar Robertson], who was the Dave Brubeck of basketball \u2013 easy but powerful and complex rhythms all at the same time. \u201cThat led the way to Dr. J [Julius Erving] and Kareem \u2013 Doc was [John] Coltrane, Kareem was Thelonious Monk with a little bit of Duke Ellington. \u2026 Magic was unbelievable [and] brought us to Motown. Also, the country sounds of Mr. Larry Bird. Then came Michael \u2013 I can\u2019t remember his last name but he played for the White Sox. He played to the beat of his own drummer. \u201cTim Duncan was not jazz; Tim Duncan was Beethoven. Then came the rappers, Shaq and [Allen] Iverson. And other virtuosos like Kobe [Bryant], LeBron [James] and Steph [Curry] and KD [Kevin Durant], [Russell] Westbrook. And the best goes on and on and on.\u201d Silver, though, might have had the morning\u2019s best line. In a shout-out to Magic Johnson \u2013 who has been fined $550,000 in the past six months for violating league tampering rules in talking publicly about Oklahoma City\u2019s Paul George and Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2013 the commissioner said: \u201cMagic, thank you for paying for the brunch today.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And they deliver on that, every year, for the most part. Which brings us to this year\u2019s showpiece: Will we finally see the All-Stars play defense, or not? Simple question. Over the last three years, they game morphed into a blob of uncontested shots and layups with the pace of a NASCAR event and the intensity level of a turtle race. Last year Steph Curry comically dropped to the floor rather than putting his body between Giannis Antetokounmpo and the rim (maybe wisely, but still). That was a flash-point moment. Perhaps because of fear of getting injured, or maybe the body just needs a break after a half-season, players rarely spent much energy trying to stop anyone. That led to wild and repetitious scoring sprees, where the losing team averaged 170 points, and ultimately, new changes designed to encourage players to at least simulate a real game and turn it up two notches. And so, Sunday\u2019s game at Staples Center will serve as the laboratory rat and perhaps usher a new era for the midseason game. If today\u2019s players treat it the way the old-timers did, then this could be special. If not, this could be 194-187. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be different,\u201d said Curry. The rules committee was alarmed enough by the public backlash of the last two games, where the winning West team came a combined 12 points from hitting the 200-point mark, that the traditional format was scrapped. No longer is it East vs. West, now it\u2019s the leading vote-getter in both conferences choosing their own squad, regardless of conference. Therefore, Team Stephen will tip against Team LeBron with the mixed squads lending some intrigue and could cure the defense and intensity issues. As an added bonus, each member of the winning team will receive $100,000 vs. $25,000 for the losers, although it must be mentioned that the only player in an All-Star uniform making below eight figures is Karl-Anthony Towns. Still, the idea was to raise the incentive level and hoping it raises the fourth-quarter heat. The coach of the LeBron team, Dwane Casey of the Raptors, said he plans to do his part by shuffling the minutes based on who\u2019s trying the hardest. \u201cI went to our players individually and asked two questions: \u2018Do you want to put on a show, or do you want to win? Let me know.\u2019 I\u2019d like them to go and compete. I want to win. We owe it to the league and the fans to let them know that the NBA isn\u2019t about rolling the ball out there. There are a lot of fundamental things we can do on the court, and it starts with the All-Star Game, with everyone watching.\u201d It helps that the game will feature a few subplots designed to make it interesting. Such as:  LeBron and Kyrie Irving, together again. They had a mysterious split last summer after Irving, two years removed from a championship in Cleveland and with the chance of additional chances to win another, demanded and received a trade. He\u2019s in Boston now, creating a rivalry with Cleveland whereas none existed before the deal. But apparently there was no acrimony generated by the split and the two have remained on decent terms, based on the chatter between them. Nothing personal, in other words. And anyway, LeBron chose Irving for this team. The reunion, says Irving, will be \u201cpretty awesome.\u201d LeBron: \u201cListen, anytime I get an opportunity to be with a fellow teammate of mine on the same court, and then you add on the fact of what we were able to accomplish in the three years, they just make it special. You automatically start thinking about the moments. There was a time when I was in Miami when I thought about if there was a chance for me to be Kyrie\u2019s teammate at All-Star Weekend. I thought about that. I didn\u2019t think it would be possible, and then we became teammates. We were on the same All-Star court together as teammates. Those thoughts still go into my head of how great it was to break the drought in our city, over 50-plus years, when the both of us had magical, magical Finals runs. So, it\u2019s always special. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, together again. Well, the two ex-Thunder \u2018mates did play for the West squad last season, yet kept their distance, both on and off the court, the entire weekend. Also, they had testy exchanges this season, evidence that if nothing else, the competitive spirit between them remains high. Yet, all seems civil regarding the split two years later, maybe because Westbrook gained a half-measure of revenge when Paul George arrived this season. Curry and James Harden, together. As team captain, Curry selected Harden, and at least for one weekend, the two will put aside some natural conflict. One: They\u2019re among the leading candidates for the MVP award, and those in the Harden camp believe he was robbed of the second MVP won by Curry. Two: The Warriors and Rockets are engaged in a thermal race for top spot in the West, with the Rockets beating Golden State twice this season so far. (Side note: Curry responded \u201cHa\u201d the other day when asked who should win the MVP this year, him or Harden. Just \u201cha.\u201d) Joel Embiid. The fun-loving big man makes his All-Star debut and promises to bring his infectious personality to the game and also his astonishing skills, rare for a seven-footer. Look for Embiid to make a strong big for game MVP and doing so apologetically. His competition could come from Antetokounmpo and either winner would signal a victory for a league looking for yet another superstar. But, the game itself. Will it be taken seriously? \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it.\u201d said Irving. \u201cLike I said, I think it\u2019s more individually based in terms of the competitive fire. But I know that we\u2019re pretty excited to be out there and compete and go at one another for a little bit and have a little fun.\u201d Last year, Antetokounmpo was playfully chastised by his teammates for going full-tilt and challenging shots and essentially treating it like a playoff game. It was his first All-Star appearance and he was surprised by the mild tone of the pace. Victor Oladipo, a first-timer this year, doesn\u2019t believe that\u2019ll happen to him. \u201cMy competitive nature is going to get the best of me,\u201d he said. The unspoken concern, of course, is injury, although there\u2019s no documented case of a player ever pulling up lame in the game. Imagine the outcry, for example, if the intensity soars and someone grabs a body part. The fallout will be steep, and with that in mind, many coaches tell their players to ease off the gas pedal. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt,\u201d said Casey, \u201cbut we want to change the narrative about this game and how it\u2019s played. I find that when players do things half-way or go through the motions, that\u2019s when they\u2019re more liable to get hurt.\u201d And so, with that in mind, with a revamped format and a bit more pocket change for the winner and an audience that would like to see some floor burn for a change, the All-Stars just could make this game interesting. That starts with defense. \u201cThe challenge is, if you\u2019re going to play to win, you\u2019re going to compete on the defensive end, especially in transition,\u201d said Casey. \u201cThat\u2019s where the all-star game kind of deteriorates. You got to start your transition defense, our one on one defense, and put defense in the game because if you don\u2019t, it will be 160, 170 points. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to change it all in one game, but that\u2019s our goal is to try to be more serious on defense, and not trick passes and trick shots and circus mentality. \u201cThese guys can entertain and also play defense and give a more competitive game. They are good enough to pull it off. That\u2019s what I hope to see and what fans hope to see.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Other topics Silver addressed during Q&A portion: ONE AND DONE: Discussions are ongoing about the current \u201cone-and-done\u201d rule for draft-eligible players, both with an NCAA commission led by former secretary of state Condoleeza Rice and within the league\u2019s ranks. The continued development of the G League as a true, 1-to-1 affiliated minor league figures to play a role in any changes, as will input from the players union. Nothing is imminent. PLAYER TAMPERING: Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson, recently fined $50,000 for \u201ctampering\u201d by talking about Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo, crossed a line despite praising the Bucks All-Star and suggesting he would lead Milwaukee to an NBA championship. \u201cContext is everything,\u201d Silver said. The commissioner said he spoke with Johnson Friday about the transgression, and left no wiggle room in the message he shared with the media Saturday: \u201cStop talking about star players on other teams.\u201d PLAYOFF SEEDS: A question about sticking to 12 All-Stars from each conference, now that the playground-draft format has rubbed out conference lines, morphed into Silver commenting again on proposals to draw 16 playoffs teams \u2013 or at least seed them \u2013 without regard for East or West. The biggest hurdle to revamping the playoffs remains travel for the first three rounds, potentially sending teams across three time zones. Silver said the league will continue studying ways to address that, perhaps stretching out the schedule further to allow more travel days. GAMBLING: Any resistance from the gambling industry to the NBA\u2019s proposed 1 percent royalty, or \u201cintegrity fee,\u201d if sports betting is legalized at a widespread level is justified, Silver said. \u201cWe will spend this year roughly $7.5 billion creating this content, creating these games,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat will come with legalized sports betting are enormous additional expenses for the league that go directly to integrity.\u201d SOCIAL ISSUES: Silver defended LeBron James, Kevin Durant and NBA players in general for using their status and social media platforms to weigh in on social issues. The two All-Stars gained notoriety this week for a video in which James used profanity in referring to President Trump. Subsequently, Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized James, questioned his knowledge of political issues and suggested he \u201cshut up and dribble,\u201d a nod to her 2003 book about Hollywood and other cultural elites, \u201cShut Up and Sing.\u201d \u201cThese players are not just basketball players, they\u2019re multi-dimensional, they care about their communities,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThey care enough to speak out, and sometimes at great risk to themselves because it\u2019s not lost on them that there are some people who will disagree with them.\u201d Silver cited Boston Celtics Hall of Famer Bill Russell \u2013 who happened to be sitting in the front row of the interview room \u2013 for Russell\u2019s involvement in the 1960s in civil rights issues, including being present in 1963 for Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech at the Lincoln Memorial. \u201cThere is this direct through-line from players like Bill Russell, here it was roughly 50 years ago, to LeBron and Kevin Durant speaking out today on issues that are important to them,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI just conclude by saying, I\u2019m really proud of them.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Those problems \u2013 stemming from the inherent tension between emotional players caught up in heated competition vs. game officials charged with coolly imposing order \u2013 seemed to worsen as this 2017-18 season has unfolded. Saturday morning\u2019s \u201csummit,\u201d which lasted approximately 90 minutes, represented more of a start to improving relations and communication rather than any sort of truce. Veteran Warriors forward Andre Iguodala, a member of the National Basketball Players Association executive committee, was among the players in the room, while referees Jason Phillips, Brian Forte and Marc Davis were there for the refs, a league source said. The NBPA and the National Basketball Referees Association issued a joint statement afterward with \u201caction items\u201d from the two sides. Later, NBA commissioner Adam Silver, in his annual All-Star news conference , talked about the two sides and the league\u2019s role as a very interested third party. \u201cThe fact that we have players and referees sitting down and talking about these issues \u2026 can only improve things,\u201d Silver said. Silver noted that, according to NBA data, the number of personal fouls and technical fouls called so far in 2017-18 is in line with previous seasons. And he suggested that there might be something cyclical in play, as far as the give-and-take between those with the whistles and those who get whistled. \u201cIt was roughly eight years ago or so we adopted these \u2018respect for the game\u2019 rules precisely because everyone said at that point things were a little bit out of control and there was a lot of frustration,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cAfter we did it, some people felt it was a little bit of an overreaction, that we were turning the players almost into robots. And of course, they needed to show a certain amount of emotion [that] wasn\u2019t disrespectful of referees. We may have slid a little back to old practices.\u201d A head-butting incident between Golden State\u2019s Shaun Livingston and veteran official Courtney Kirkland drew attention to the tension . The Warriors had other flurries of angst and anger involving the refs, with Draymond Green (characteristically) and Kevin Durant (uncharacteristically) racking up technical and ejections. Some critics publicly, and some referees privately, feel the players have been overstepping their bounds with anger and antics after decisions they dislike, and complaining about too many calls generally. Others have been critical of the referees, particularly younger, less experienced ones, for failing to communicate sufficiently with players when questioned and for having short fuses in dishing technicals and ejections. The discussion Saturday morning focused on those gripes, at least giving the principals areas to address with their colleagues. The \u201caction items\u201d are broad, such as clarifying those \u201crespect for the game rules\u201d referred to by Silver and coming up with an informal \u201cchannel of communication\u201d by which individual players or referees might air grievances or seek explanations. It was a start \u2013 more meetings and discussion will be held. And it couldn\u2019t have hurt. \u201cIn this meeting, we took some important steps in identifying existing frustrations for both sides,\u201d NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts said in the joint statement. \u201cNow with that information, we plan to move forward and continue to work together to find solutions that will enhance the on-court experience for both parties.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of discussion about decorum and how players can talk to officials,\u201d said Mark Denesuk, spokesman for the referees union. \u201cThe discussion was pretty honest and the people in the room were open about their feelings.\u201d One NBA coach at All-Star Weekend said he noticed a thaw in player-referee relations in recent weeks. Roberts and NBRA general counsel Lee Seham had met in December in New York, initiating these talks, and the NBA followed up with its own initiative to improve the situation. Despite not having league officials participate in Saturday\u2019s meeting, Silver talked at length about the league\u2019s active role in trying to bridge any gaps between the two sides. In the league\u2019s plan, two recent league appointees \u2013 longtime ref Monty McCutchen now working as NBA Vice President, and Head of Referee Development and Training\/NBA Senior VP Michelle Johnson, working as head of referee operations \u2013 are taking the lead in meeting with all 30 teams on rules interpretations, on-court conduct and expectations of the referees. They also will be conducting conflict-resolution training for the officials. Still, Silver added: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic and a great statement about this league that these important shareholders \u2026 think it\u2019s important enough and they have an obligation to the game where they should be sitting down and talking to each other.\u201d Of the aforementioned coach\u2019s perception that there already has been some improvement, Denesuk said: \u201cWhen a lot of attention gets put on an issue like this one, I think it\u2019s natural for those involved to ask, \u2018What is my role in all this?\u2019\u201d In the Warriors\u2019 last game before the All-Star break, Green had a spirited discussion with referee Bill Spooner after a ruling with which he disagreed. But Spooner responded calmly and the NBA\u2019s leader in technical fouls (14) wound up patting the ref on the hip and playing on. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Cleveland Cavaliers superstar reiterated his determination to speak out on social issues and the nation\u2019s political climate Saturday during his media availability for the NBA All-Star Game. \u201cI will not just shut up and dribble,\u201d James said. \u201cI get to sit up here and talk about what\u2019s really important.\u201d James spoke publicly after Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized the three-time NBA champion for his recent comments about social issues. James previously responded with an Instagram post containing similar sentiments. \u201cWe will definitely not shut up and dribble,\u201d James said. \u201cI will definitely not do that. I mean too much to society. I mean too much to the youth. I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don\u2019t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they\u2019re in.\u201d James made the initial public comments in question during a recent video segment on Uninterrupted, a platform co-founded by James. He was joined by Kevin Durant, and both superstars were sharply critical of President Donald Trump and the nation\u2019s racial climate. James referenced Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Bill Russell and Jackie Robinson as athletes who previously spoke up for equality and change with no concerns about the consequences or any rewards. \u201cWe know it\u2019s bigger than us,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about us. I\u2019m going to continue to do what I have to do to play this game that I love to play, but this is bigger than me playing the game of basketball.\u201d James was backed at media day by several All-Stars including Stephen Curry, Paul George, Draymond Green and Durant. They all believe athletes have an important opportunity to advocate for positive social change. \u201cWe\u2019re a part of what\u2019s going on this world, what\u2019s going on in this society, just as much as anybody else,\u201d said George, the Oklahoma City Thunder forward from nearby Palmdale, California. \u201cWe\u2019re fathers. We\u2019re sons. We\u2019re brothers. We\u2019ve got family to look after. We\u2019re connected as deeply in this as anybody else is. For someone to go out and say, `Stick to dribbling a basketball,\u2019 that\u2019s pretty ignorant. That just goes to show you where we are as a country right now.\u201d Commissioner Adam Silver strongly supported James and other outspoken NBA players later Saturday, saying he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of James and Durant in particular. Silver compared the current players\u2019 outspoken passion to the stances taken by past greats including Russell, who is in attendance at All-Star weekend. Silver noted that Russell was the MVP of Los Angeles\u2019 first All-Star Game in 1963, a year in which Russell also won a championship in Boston and stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. \u201cAs commissioner of the NBA, this is a legacy of important work that I\u2019ve inherited, that I continue to encourage,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThese players are not just basketball players. They\u2019re multi-dimensional. They care about their communities, and they care about what\u2019s happening in their country. They then care enough to speak out, and sometimes at great risk to themselves, because it\u2019s not lost on them that there are some people who will disagree with them. \u201cSocial media is full of hate as well. \u2026 I\u2019m really proud of them.\u201d Curry called the Fox News host\u2019s comments and dismissive tone \u201caggressive and just out of line \u2026 but not surprising, because I\u2019ve heard that plenty of times before.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the tone that people (utilize to) try to put athletes and black athletes in a box, to say, `Basketball is the only thing that you can provide in this world,\u201d\u2018 Curry said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, obviously, very upsetting. I think the way that we handle the response is to highlight all the good that we\u2019re doing \u2026 Every single NBA athlete here that plays this game, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. That\u2019s not all that we contribute to this world. \u201cGuys are going out, putting resources and funds, and raising awareness in the community and trying to make the world a better place through what we do.\u201d"},{"id":41686,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-channing-frye-appendectomy","date":"2018-02-17","title":"Los Angeles Lakers' Channing Frye undergoes appendectomy in Cleveland","content":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Lakers forward Channing Frye has undergone an appendectomy.

Consider: Ray Allen, Grant Hill, Jason Kidd and Steve Nash are newly eligible candidates joining fellow former NBA stars Maurice Cheeks and Chris Webber among the 2018 finalists. Katie Smith and Tina Thompson of WNBA fame are on the ballot as first-timers. The Hall shortened the waiting period for players to three years after retirement from five, the traditional gap still used by the Baseball, Pro Football and other sports shrines. One argument for the longer duration is that a candidate\u2019s career is easier to put in context over time. But another side of that? \u201cOut of sight, out of mind,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to wait that amount of time.\u201d It\u2019s not as if any of the candidate adds any statistics or exploits to his resume. \u201cTheir number speak for themselves. They are who they are,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cAnd whether it\u2019s three years, four years or five years, the sooner the better. They can be recognized when they can enjoy it.\u201d Nothing is worse than receiving a posthumous award, after all, though that\u2019s more of an issue for coaches. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty current as far as our sport because our fans know our players,\u201d Colangelo added. \u201cThey come face-to-face with them every game, in the arena or on TV, in a way they don\u2019t with football or even baseball. We think it\u2019s a way to maximize that exposure and do it sooner rather than later.\u201d Said Dominique Wilkins, one of 11 Hall of Famers on the stage for the finalists announcement: \u201cThe [longer] waiting period made it interesting. But things change, and you have to change with the change.\u201d The Hall\u2019s use of \u201cdirect elect\u201d categories in recent years \u2013 for African-American pioneers, for international candidates, for contributors and for a list considered by a veterans committee \u2013 has alleviated what had been a backlog of worthy selections, Colangelo said. For instance, the ABA category was done away after several deserving alumni of that upstart league, such as Artis Gilmore and Roger Brown, were enshrined. The other five finalists announced Saturday morning at a new conference at STAPLES Center were: Maryland coach Lefty Driesell, Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich, women\u2019s coach Kim Mulkey, former NBA referee Hugh Evans and the 1954-58 Wayland Baptist University women\u2019s program in the team category. A finalist must receive 18 votes from the 24-member Honor Committee, with no minimum or maximum for induction. In theory, all 13 could make it, though Colangelo said most Hall classes have range from four to eight per year. The Class of 2018 will be announced March 31 at the men\u2019s NCAA basketball Final Four in San Antonio. This year\u2019s enshrinement at the Naismith Hall in Springfield, Mass., is set for Sept. 7. Four others were announced Saturday as winners of the Hall\u2019s traditional awards. The 2018 John Bunn Lifetime Achievement honorees are Jim Host, a marketing pioneer for college basketball, and Harley Redin, who posted a 431-66 record in women\u2019s college basketball and led teams to six AAU national titles from 1956 to 1971. The Curt Gowdy media awards for 2018 were announced, with longtime NBA photographer Andrew Bernstein being recognized in the print category and ESPN\/ABC color analyst Doris Burke honored in broadcast media.

Previous finalists included again this year for consideration are four-time NBA All-Star Maurice Cheeks, the only coach in NCAA history to be named Conference Coach of the Year in four different conferences Charles \u201cLefty\u201d Driesell, 28-year NBA referee Hugh Evans, two-time NCAA National Championship Coach of Baylor Kim Mulkey, two-time NBA Champion coach Rudy Tomjanovich, five-time NBA All-Star Chris Webber and 10-time AAU National Champions Wayland Baptist University. \u201cTo be named a Finalist for the Basketball Hall of Fame is an incredible distinction and we are proud to honor those who have made a tremendous impact on the game over the years,\u201d said Jerry Colangelo, Chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cThe Honors Committee now has the challenging task of selecting this year\u2019s Enshrinees, which we look forward to announcing at the NCAA Final Four in San Antonio.\u201d Announced in December, two distinct modifications have been made to the election process. Most notably, potential honorees are eligible on the ballot for Hall of Fame enshrinement after three full seasons of retirement, starting with the Class of 2018. The second reform to Hall of Fame eligibility requires coaches to have coached for 25 years and reached the minimum age of 60. This will allow the Honors Committee to evaluate a larger body of work for those coaches nominated. This change will take effect in 2020, allowing a grace period for coaches who are nearing Hall of Fame eligibility based on previous standards. The complete list of nine finalists from the North American Screening Committee includes: players Ray Allen, Maurice Cheeks, Grant Hill, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash and Chris Webber; coaches Charles \u201cLefty\u201d Driesell and Rudy Tomjanovich; and referee Hugh Evans. The four finalists from the Women\u2019s Screening Committee includes: players Katie Smith and Tina Thompson, coach Kim Mulkey, and Wayland Baptist University as a team. The Class of 2018 will be announced on Saturday, March 31 at a press conference in San Antonio prior to the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four. Enshrinees from the Direct Elect Committees are also recognized at the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four and include Early African-American Pioneers, International, Contributors and Veterans. A finalist needs 18 of 24 votes from the Honors Committee for election into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The Class of 2018 will be enshrined during festivities in Springfield, Massachusetts, the birthplace of basketball, September 6-8, 2018.

The two will be acknowledged for their contributions to basketball media during the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement events Sept. 6-8 in Springfield, Massachusetts \u2013 the birthplace of basketball. The Curt Gowdy Media Award is named in honor of the late Curt Gowdy, a legendary sports broadcaster and former Hall of Fame Board member and President. This prestigious award is presented annually to members of the electronic and print media whose longtime efforts have made a significant contribution to the game of basketball. For 35 years, Andrew Bernstein\u2019s creative eye has captured the National Basketball Association, its grand events and its world-renowned athletes. Born in Brooklyn, Bernstein developed his interest and talent in photography as a teenager. His visual gifts were recognized quite early, as his initial portfolio earned him a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship and scholarship to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. Earning his degree in 1981, Bernstein pursued his first and true love, sports photography, working as a studio assistant and a part-time assistant for Sports Illustrated . Simultaneously pursuing his craft as a freelancer, he earned his living photographing hockey, basketball, football and baseball games in the Los Angeles area. Developing connections as he honed his craft, Bernstein serendipitously came to the attention of NBA personnel while sitting in the PR office of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1982. The resultant conversation with NBA Properties put him in line for his first NBA gig, the 1983 NBA All-Star game at The Forum. Since that chance encounter, Bernstein has earned a well-deserved reputation as one of the best in the world of sports photography. Blessed with extraordinary technical knowledge, he also possesses the rare ability to see a world others cannot, and capture it on film. His thoughtful and respectful treatment of the athletes he photographs has earned their trust and admiration. This, in turn, has allowed Bernstein unique access to athletes and athletic events resulting in photographs that resonate with vibrant emotions and explosive action. Over the course of his career Bernstein has become the official photographer for most of Los Angeles\u2019 professional sports franchises, including the Clippers, Dodgers, Kings and Lakers. He also covered and photographed the United States Olympic basketball teams in 1992, 1996, and 2000. His company, Bernstein Associates, Inc., has an extensive list of clients including Nike, adidas, Pepsi, Paramount Pictures and American Express. As a basketball standout at Providence College who held seven records upon graduation, Doris Burke went on to spend two seasons as an assistant coach before finding her true calling as a basketball analyst. Ahead of the 2017-18 NBA season, ESPN named Doris Burke a full-time ESPN NBA game analyst, making her the first woman named to this role. Across nearly three decades, she has been a top commentator on several significant ESPN properties, including the NBA, women\u2019s and men\u2019s college basketball and the WNBA. She also serves as the lead ESPN NBA sideline reporter for NBA playoff games and the NBA Finals on ABC. From 1990-2000, Burke began her career as an analyst on regional coverage of BIG EAST and Atlantic-10 women\u2019s basketball on the New England Sports Network (NESN). She concurrently worked as a play-by-play commentator for Providence College women\u2019s basketball on WICE\/WNPW Radio (1990-97) and Providence College men\u2019s basketball with WPRO Radio (1992-95).

Burke was a women\u2019s college basketball analyst for CBS Sports (1998-2001) and has long been an analyst for the WNBA\u2019s New York Liberty on MSG Network. Burke is recognized as the first woman to call a BIG EAST men\u2019s basketball game on television and a Knicks radio and television broadcast (2000). In addition to her work on camera, Burke has been frequent columnist for Basketball Times Magazine and Eastern Basketball Magazine since 2001, as well as a contributing writer for the Center for Sports Parenting.

And yet here he is, against seemingly all odds, Mitchell finds himself in a position to continue his stunning and meteoric rise from surprise lottery pick out of Louisville to legitimate challenger for Rookie of the Year to a prime spot in the Verizon Slam Dunk contest tonight at Staples Center. It\u2019s a space where NBA stars have been born over the years, a place where a guy like Mitchell could see his steady climb to prominence explode into global acknowledgement of what\u2019s been obvious to many of his NBA brethren for a while now: the kid from Louisville could be the true breakout star of a showcase night that also features star-studded fields for the JBL 3-point Contest and the Taco Bell Skills Challenge . Mitchell is one of the stars of a stacked rookie class that has outperformed expectations in a lot of respects \u2014 from high lottery picks like Jayson Tatum and Lauri Markkanen all the way down to the bottom of the first round in the form of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma, who like Mitchell wasn\u2019t necessarily forecasted as an impact player on Draft night last summer. \u201cI tell people all the time this wasn\u2019t my plan after two years of college,\u201d Mitchell said Friday before his spin in the Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars . \u201cBeing here for All-Star, even being in the NBA, wasn\u2019t entirely in my plan.\u201d Mitchell arrived here having authored a splendid rewrite of the plan in Utah this season. He wasn\u2019t a burger chain all-american coming out of high school or a one-and-done college star. But now he\u2019s Utah\u2019s biggest star. That\u2019s why this surreal moment, this opportunity on this stage, gets him going. \u201cWhen I had the dunk contest practice. Walked me into Staples. I\u2019ve been to Staples before. But with the All-Star on the court, just kind of seeing all that has been pretty crazy for me,\u201d he said. \u201cJust being here and being part of this weekend \u2026 as a kid, you dreamed about watching it. When I was a kid, my favorite event was the Slam Dunk Contest. \u201cSo just being here now and playing in it, being in the event where there are no teammates in the Slam Dunk Contest. It\u2019s all on you. I\u2019ve never been in a position like that where millions of people are watching just me. So it will be interesting and fun.\u201d It will be if Mitchell\u2019s performance during tonight\u2019s competition is handled the the way he has handled himself throughout his rookie season. He\u2019s leading the Jazz, and all rookies, in scoring and earning the praise and respect of former players and his veteran colleagues around the league with each and every spectacular outing. Even Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 All-Star center and professional troll, showed Mitchell some love while he stumped for his point guard and teammate Ben Simmons for Rookie of the Year honors. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s [Mitchell] really good. I like his game,\u201d said Embiid, who does not dole out straight-faced praise for opponents often, if at all. \u201cHe\u2019s athletic, he can score the ball, defense. I like his game a lot.\u201d There\u2019s so much to like. Mitchell\u2019s been the best and most electrifying player, a viral sensation, on the hottest team in the league heading into this weekend. The Jazz own a league-best 11-game win streak, one better than the first place in the Western Conference standings Houston Rockets, and have climbed into the Western Conference playoff chase on the strength of Mitchell\u2019s work as their catalyst. But if he can prevail in a dunk contest against a monster field that also includes Dallas rookie jumping jack Dennis Smith Jr., high-flying Cleveland forward Larry Nance Jr. and Indiana All-Star Victor Oladipo, Mitchell will be introduced into an entirely new audience. With the global spotlight shining bright, Mitchell, an injury replacement in the competition for injured Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon, has a chance to continue rewriting the narrative of his own career. So he refuses to take anything for granted, not a single second of the joyride he\u2019s on right now. \u201cNope, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I said, this whole thing has been a whirlwind for me. Just enjoying the process. And there are games that I\u2019m like, wow, this happened, or wow, that happened. It\u2019s a credit to my teammates and the coaching staff and organization for believing in me. Without them none of this would be possible. So I really thank them for giving me this opportunity.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

It offers a wide range of tips and drills, can be customized to a user\u2019s areas of interest and even allows for interactive analysis via videos shot and uploaded by subscribers. From Friday through March 1, people may register and opt-in for seven days of free unlimited access to the site\u2019s premium content. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more excited about a business-and-basketball endeavor that [the NBCA] has done,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle, president of the coaches association, told NBA.com. \u201cThis is a phenomenal opportunity to influence the way our game is taught throughout the world.\u201d More than 20 NBA coaches began working on the project more than a year ago, shooting skills and strategy \u201cvignettes\u201d in their NBA cities or, in many cases, during the Las Vegas Summer League last summer. Eventually, if the partnership with eCoach is a financial success, Carlisle said, proceeds would be used to aid and benefit past and present NBCA members. Premium membership for the site\u2019s features costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 annually. For now, though, the Mavericks coach said eCoach is exciting for its scope and potential impact. \u201cThe audience possibilities are wide-ranging,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything from young kids looking for ball handling and shooting drills to practice, to accomplished coaches in countries all over the world.\u201d Taking a \u201ctest drive\u201d of the site via a smartphone, a user accessed the following hoops wisdom in a matter of minutes: That\u2019s a wealth of information from the top coaches in basketball, all accessed with a few pokes at a touchscreen or a keyboard. \u201cFor many years, coaches have been doing clinics worldwide,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always a desire whenever they leave for more information. \u2018How can we stay current? How can we stay up to date?\u2019 This is what eCoach is going to provide.\u201d Said Detroit\u2019s Stan Van Gundy: \u201ceCoach gives us an opportunity to share what we have learned with coaches and players around the world.

Then again, every team gets scouted down to the most minor detail now. Every moment of every play of every game has been captured on video for years now.

He was 84. The Dallas County medical examiner said he died Wednesday night. The cause was not disclosed. Carter co-founded the franchise with Norm Sonju, the club\u2019s first president. Carter sold majority interest to Ross Perot Jr. in 1996 but kept a minority stake. The Mavericks were a model franchise in the early days, quickly becoming a contender and reaching the Western Conference finals in 1988 before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. When Dallas won the franchise\u2019s only championship in 2011, owner Mark Cuban invited Carter to celebrate with the team on the court in Miami. Commissioner David Stern handed the trophy to Carter, who was wearing his trademark white cowboy hat that was part of the team\u2019s early logo. Cuban, who bought the team in 2000, called Carter and his wife, Linda, the \u201cguiding lights for the organization.\u201d \u201cTo say he will be missed does not do justice to just how important Mr. C has been to the Dallas Mavericks and the city of Dallas,\u201d he said. The Mavericks will honor Carter with a moment of silence before their next home game, Feb. 26 against Indiana. Carter remained a regular at courtside after selling the team, but his appearances slipped in recent months because of declining health. He wasn\u2019t there when the Mavericks retired guard Derek Harper\u2019s number last month. Harper was among the early star players for Carter, along with Mark Aguirre and Rolando Blackman. Carter and Sonju negotiated with the NBA for months before the league agreed to let Carter pay half of the $12 million expansion fee in two early installments rather than requiring all $6 million up front. The team was introduced on May 1, 1980, in downtown Dallas near the site of Reunion Arena, which was the team\u2019s home for 21 seasons. Carter told The Dallas Morning News in 2005 that part of his decision to acquire a franchise was as a present to his wife, who had been a standout high school basketball player. * * *"},{"id":41717,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-all-star-2018-numbers-official-release","date":"2018-02-15","title":"NBA All-Star 2018: By the numbers","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2013 The 2018 NBA All-Star Game will be played on Sunday, Feb. 18 at Staples Center (8 p.m. ET) as Los Angeles hosts NBA All-Star for a record sixth time.

On Wednesday night, according to Thomas, Rondo let Thomas know about that right in his face. In the first quarter of Wednesday night\u2019s Lakers-Pelicans game in New Orleans , both Rondo and Thomas were ejected after getting tangled up, exchanging words and getting into it with each other. The sequence took place with 37.6 seconds left in the quarter after an inbounds play by the Lakers. Thomas was on the left wing working to free up teammate Brandon Ingram with an off-ball screen on the Pelicans\u2019 Darius Miller. Rondo, who was guarding Thomas during this sequence, hounded Thomas as he set his screen for Ingram. From there, the two players became entangled and had words for each other. The two were given double technical fouls and tossed with 33.3 seconds left in the quarter. Thomas told the media after the game that Rondo hit him three times and brought up the planned video tribute the Celtics had set for him earlier this season. Talk of that tribute brought comments from Rondo himself as well as Paul Pierce . The tribute was originally planned for the Feb. 11 Celtics-Cleveland Cavaliers game \u2014 the same game at which Pierce\u2019s No. 34 was retired by the team. ESPN\u2019s Ohm Youngmisuk was on hand for last night\u2019s game and has comments from Thomas about the incident : According to the Los Angeles Times , a Pelicans spokesperson said Rondo left the locker room Wednesday night before reporters were allowed inside. Regarding the video tribute, Thomas was on the Cavs at the time before last week\u2019s trade to the Lakers and said that he didn\u2019t want a tribute video from the Celtics . In a January interview with the Worcester Telegram & Gazette , Rondo made his original displeasure known about the planned Thomas tribute . \u201cWhat has he done?\u201d Rondo told the newspaper. When told that Thomas led the Celtics to the Eastern Conference finals last season, Rondo said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what we celebrate around here?\u201d \u201cThis is the Boston Celtics,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Phoenix Suns. No disrespect to any other organization, but you don\u2019t hang conference titles. Do we hang going to the conference finals? What do we hang here?\u201d Thomas wasn\u2019t the only member of the Lakers to get ejected as coach Luke Walton was tossed with 1:38 left in the second quarter. Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma was called for a foul after he thought he got a clean steal, after which he protested and got a technical foul. Walton was upset by the sequence and ran onto the court near the Pelicans bench, shouting at the official. Referee Mike Smith then hit Walton with two techicals. He has seven techs this season, second on the NBA among coaches to Atlanta Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer (who has nine). * * *"},{"id":47276,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sacramento-kings-rookie-deaaron-fox-head-injury","date":"2018-02-15","title":"Sacramento Kings rookie De'Aaron Fox receiving stitches after head injury","content":"Sacramento Kings guard De\u2019Aaron Fox left Wednesday\u2019s game in Houston during the final minute after hitting his head on the floor as part of scary fall.

Who\u2019s a bigger first-round nightmare: the Jazz, the Denver Nuggets, the New Orleans Pelicans or the LA Clippers?  * * * David Aldridge :  I think it\u2019s Utah, which has a real defensive difference maker in Rudy Gobert, a legit low-post talent in Derrick Favors and a crazy good rookie in Donovan Mitchell who takes and makes big shots. Plus, Joe Ingles hasn\u2019t missed a 3-pointer in a month, it seems. And, as predicted, Jae Crowder will fit right into what coach Quin Snyder does. It\u2019s a deep and balanced team, and defensively imposing. If Crowder can hit enough jumpers, the Jazz will be really tough in the first round. Steve Aschburner : Denver. New Orleans would have been my pick if DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 season wasn\u2019t over. I\u2019m not sure Utah even makes it to the postseason \u2014 the Jazz might be peaking right now. Elsewhere in today\u2019s blogtable, I make my feelings clear on the Clippers (meh). But the Nuggets are young and hungry, with a core growing up together in Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles and Will Barton. Working in veteran forward Paul Millsap, a grown-up, when he returns from wrist surgery will help without hindering. And I think coach Mike Malone has these guys\u2019 ear. That said, the Nuggets better finish sixth or higher, because the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets will be the only nightmares \u2014 for their opponents \u2014 in their first-round series. Tas Melas :  Denver. Dynamic guards, 3-point shooting, skilled big men and a heck of a homecourt advantage. Their defense has been lacking but some of that can be put on the Paul Millsap injury (they were middle of the pack defensively before Millsap got hurt). They strike me as fearless \u2014 when your leader is Nikola Jokic, that makes sense. John Schuhmann :  Of those four teams, the Jazz have the best record (4-6) against the top four teams in the West. But Denver has the most potent offense of the group, and that\u2019s playing most of this season without Paul Millsap, who should be back next month. The Nuggets have matchup issues both on the perimeter (with Jamal Murray) and inside (with Nikola Jokic), as well as some versatility at the forward spots. They will have a tough time defending Golden State and Houston (in fact, only the Wolves have allowed the Rockets to score more efficiently this season ), but they will scare those teams on the other end of the floor.  Sekou Smith :  Denver strikes me as the most dangerous team of the bunch because they have the depth and versatility on their roster to make life miserable from one of the West favorites. The playoffs are, as always, all about matchups. And Denver, provided Paul Millsap returns in form, can present issues that the other teams on this list cannot in a playoff setting. I\u2019m not here calling for them to upset the Golden State Warriors or Houston Rockets in a potential first round series. But I am suggesting that they\u2019ll make things much more interesting than you might think. They have the personnel to run shooters off of the 3-point line, play up-tempo at a high level and keep up with the Warriors and Rockets in ways that I think would be much more difficult for the Jazz, Pelicans and Clippers."},{"id":41719,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-trade-deadline-aftermath-all-star-preview","date":"2018-02-14","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Trade deadline aftermath + All-Star predictions","content":"Greg Anthony and John Schuhmann join me to discuss the new-look Cavaliers, the biggest threats to the Warriors, and more after a busy NBA trade deadline.

What should be the top item on their agenda?  * * * David Aldridge : Getting everyone to calm the (bleep) down about \u201crespect.\u201d The refs whine about not getting shown up by a player expressing legitimate anger; the players whine about refs not allowing them to vent in real time. You\u2019re all getting paid a ridiculous amount of money. Players (especially the young ones), you don\u2019t have to gesticulate wildly every time you disagree with a call. Refs (especially the young ones), you can take a little barking without feeling emasculated and having to show how tough you are. Steve Aschburner :  Look, there\u2019s a cats vs. dogs aspect to the relationship between players and referees, which suggests a gap that can never be bridged. One side is emotions, the other is reason. The active participants in the competition of a game run hot, fueled by their passions and the urgency to achieve their elusive goals in a frantic 48 minutes. The game officials represent cool detachment, the rule of law and authority. They cannot, must not, approach the game solely in the moment. Both sides can improve; the refs underwent personality-ectomies about 20 years ago, when the league opted for automatons. The players need to understand this dynamic doesn\u2019t change just because their paychecks and sway over teams got bigger. But let\u2019s start here: Players (and coaches) need to stop complaining about every darn call. We get it \u2014 they want every play adjudicated in their favor. But when you repeatedly tell a person who is obviously right that he or she is wrong, you lose credibility. Then when you do have a legitimate gripe, you\u2019ve been tuned out or get back a reflexive shrug. Tas Melas :  Establishing an on-court protocol for discussion of a controversial call. In other words: when a player has a problem with a call, walk away from the play and meet the referee by the scorer\u2019s table. (And if this song plays in the arena when it happens, I\u2019d be happy.) John Schuhmann :  Decorum, civility, respectfulness, etc. Both sides need to hear each other out and there are probably certain referee tendencies that the players would like changed. But I think the greater onus is on the players to tone down the complaining on a night-to-night and possession-to-possession basis. There\u2019s been far too much whining and I\u2019ve seen several instances this season of players complaining about calls or no-calls that were obviously correct. It\u2019s an emotional game, but they need to have more discipline and be more selective about the what they argue about.  Sekou Smith :  The first item on the agenda has to be the immediate turn down of the temperature between players and officials during games. They have to come to some meeting of the minds about both sides getting their in-game emotions and actions under better control. Everything else can be worked out from there. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t feel like the sides have to become best friends or anything. There just needs to be a modicum of respect restored in order for everyone to move on. The game is competitive enough and certainly healthy enough these days that we don\u2019t need an extra layer of drama added by players and referees who can\u2019t get out of each other\u2019s way during games. Both sides need to come together, get over themselves, agree to change the temperature and move on with what has otherwise been another fantastic NBA season. * * *"},{"id":41723,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-do-los-angeles-lakers-or-la-clippers-need-roster-overhaul-more","date":"2018-02-14","title":"Blogtable: Do Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers need roster overhaul more?","content":" * * * Los Angeles, host of NBA All-Star 2018, has two NBA teams and zero NBA All-Stars. So who is most in need of a roster overhaul: the Lakers or Clippers?  * * * David Aldridge :  The Clippers. The Lakers do have some promising young pieces (Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, and you give up on Lonzo Ball at your premature peril). And, maybe, they can keep Julius Randle now, too. The Clips may be more ready to play a game tonight, assuming a healthy Danilo Gallinari, Milos Teodosic, Patrick Beverley, et. al., but they don\u2019t have a long shelf life and they seem to get injured a lot. DeAndre Jordan is a defensive presence but limited offensively as we all know (so is Ball, true, but at least he can impact at that end with his passing). Tobias Harris is a still young good player to build around, though. Steve Aschburner : The Clippers need the makeover more. At least with the Lakers, we know what the plan is, because we\u2019ve been told about it over and over \u2013 in rather costly fashion \u2013 by Magic Johnson. We see Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle and flawed Lonzo Ball and we await the arrival of two All-Star free agents. Might happen, might not, but at least that\u2019s the blueprint. The Clippers just seem to be parts, some of them mismatched, several of them underwhelming. Unless they pull off a summer stunner in free agency, they seem headed for mediocrity, which is worse than either contending or rebuilding. Tas Melas :  The Clippers. The Lakers\u2019 overhaul happens on June 30 when over $60 million worth of contracts (Brook Lopez, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Corey Brewer, Channing Frye and Isaiah Thomas) expire. The Lakers can do what they want with all that potential room while the Clippers are handcuffed. The new front office did a good job to get out from under the Blake Griffin deal; next up, the DeAndre Jordan conundrum. After that, the Danilo Gallinari brainteaser. Beyond that though, the Clippers\u2019 books are pretty clear. John Schuhmann :  Both teams have one contract \u2014 that of Danilo Gallinari for the Clippers and that of Luol Deng for the Lakers \u2014 that makes you cringe. But both teams also have more flexibility than they had three weeks ago. The Lakers are set up pretty well with four talented first round picks in the first or second year of their rookie contracts and a ton of cap space. But the timelines of any free agents they try to sign this summer probably won\u2019t align with the timelines of Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma, who aren\u2019t ready to play for a contender. The Clippers have a lot of good players on the same timeline right now (and the guy with their bad contract is actually playing), and that\u2019s not a bad thing. For the short term, the Lakers are more in need of a talent infusion, but if they can be patient, they\u2019re in great shape.  Sekou Smith :  There are plenty of All-Stars with LA ties ready to invade the city this weekend, but for none of them to be Lakers or Clippers does seem a bit strange. The Lakers and Clippers are both in need of some serious roster replenishing\/refurbishment.  And I think the matter is much more pressing for the Lakers , who haven\u2019t been in the Western Conference playoff conversation for years. They could use a roster overhaul as soon as humanly possible. I think it\u2019s why Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka did what they at the trade deadline , making sure they created the flexibility to chase two elite superstars in free agency this summer. The Clippers made of move of their own, of course, trading Blake Griffin to Detroit, but they also have DeAndre Jordan\u2019s situation to tend to. And they don\u2019t have pieces of their young core in place right now the way the Lakers do. That makes a huge difference, in terms of what sort of timeline a franchise is working on in the rebuilding process. The Lakers need that roster overhaul to put themselves back into the mix immediately."},{"id":41741,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/storylines-abound-after-2018-nba-all-star-draft","date":"2018-02-14","title":"Storylines abound after 2018 NBA All-Star draft","content":"There is an alternate universe in which LeBron James and Kyrie Irving are once again teammates, where the Warriors\u2019 star quartet is divided, and where players who very recently exchanged barbs must now share locker rooms. Welcome to the world of the 2018 NBA All-Star Game , which sports a very different twist after Thursday\u2019s inaugural draft in which team captains James and Stephen Curry selected their teammates . Here is what we know: James had the first pick, Curry the second, and so on, back and forth until the rosters were set. We do not know in what order the players were picked despite the valiant efforts of TNT\u2019s Ernie Johnson. The dust has settled and the rosters are set, with the line between East and West officially dissolved. The focus is squarely on players rather than conference. Here\u2019s a look at the most intriguing takeaways after Thursday\u2019s results: The offseason parting between LeBron James and Kyrie Irving was dramatically awkward, with the latter leaving the former in order to show his athletic independence . Irving has since proved capable of leading the Boston Celtics to contender status despite the opening-night loss of fellow All-Star swingman Gordon Hayward . James, meanwhile, has been forced to do much of the heavy lifting while the rest of his teammates have either plateaued (Kevin Love), dropped off (J.R. Smith, Tristan Thompson) or been unavailable (Derrick Rose, Isaiah Thomas). The Cavs have suffered as a result, posting one of the worst records in the league since the calendar flipped to 2018. Could it be that James is hoping to recapture some of his old magic by temporarily reuniting with Irving? Or does he just miss\/like the guy despite their on-court differences? \u201cTo be able to team up back with Kyrie is always special, along with Kevin Love,\u201d James said during a post-draft interview with TNT . \u201cJust for us to have another weekend to bring some of the memories we had when we were all together. Kyrie was available on the draft board. He\u2019s one of the best point guards we have in our league. So, it was an easy choice for me.\u201d Other reunions are scattered among Team LeBron\u2019s roster. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant will enjoy an encore of their much publicized All-Star get-together last season . The Thunder guard will also play with his old college teammate, Kevin Love, for the first time since they both represented the Western Conference in the 2012 midseason classic . Don\u2019t forget, too, that Pacers guard Victor Oladipo is making his All-Star debut alongside Westbrook, the man many now think held back the former No. 2 overall pick in Oklahoma City. After putting up his worst numbers since his rookie year while playing alongside Westbrook, Oladipo is enjoying a career year while guiding the upstart Pacers to the middle of the playoff pack. Some teammates are just meant to stay together. Curry and James certainly struggled to separate several dynamic duos, including those from the Minnesota Timberwolves (Jimmy Butler\/Karl-Anthony Towns), New Orleans Pelicans (Anthony Davis\/DeMarcus Cousins), Washington Wizards (Bradley Beal\/John Wall) and Toronto Raptors (Lowry\/DeRozan). The NBA teammates not sticking together are those from Golden State and Boston. James managed to chip away at the Warriors\u2019 dominant quartet, selecting Kevin Durant for his squad before Curry made sure to keep Klay Thompson and Draymond Green on his own team. Curry also selected Al Horford, presumably at some point after James took Irving. Most All-Stars already come with a bag full of accomplishments under their belts, and this year is no exception. How they are distributed, however, is interesting to note. Everyone who made the team this year and has won an All-Star Most Valuable Player award in the past is on Team LeBron: Davis, Durant, Irving, James, Westbrook (who won it twice). Good luck guessing which one will make a push for a repeat at that honor (assuming someone new doesn\u2019t beat them to the punch). Meanwhile, the majority of the gold medal-winning 2016 U.S. Olympic team resides on Team Stephen: Butler, DeRozan, Green, Kyle Lowry and Klay Thompson. Team LeBron sports three \u201916 Olympians: Cousins, Durant and Irving. One skill that surely matters on All-Star weekend is scoring. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, Team Stephen sports two of the top three scorers in the league in Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Of course, Team LeBron carries the next four names from that scoring-leaders list (James, Davis, Durant, Cousins). Some words you can\u2019t take back, and it would be difficult to see Westbrook or Portland guard Damian Lillard doing so after recent events. Oklahoma City\u2019s star took exception to teammate Paul George not being voted in as an All-Star, proceeding to call out the Warriors for having four players so honored. Then he targeted another player, and though he didn\u2019t use names, it seemed pretty clear that he was talking about Lillard when he referred to \u201cguys complaining about being snubbed so they can get in.\u201d Lillard has been extremely vocal to the media and on social media about not making the last two All-Star teams despite both those seasons being two of his best yet. That was after making the All-Star team in \u201914 and \u201915. The Trail Blazers guard seemed to pick up on the hint, and he responded directly to his Western Conference counterpart. \u201cI respect Russ a lot, so it was kind of disappointing to see him say that,\u201d Lillard said prior to Wednesday\u2019s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cBecause he\u2019s played against me, he\u2019s played against our team, he knows what I\u2019ve accomplished. Not just this year, but over my career.\u201d Will the point guards clear the air, or will tension linger heading into the game? Also worth monitoring: does James\u2019 All-Star selection of Love mean all is well between the much-maligned forward and his team? Reports surfaced earlier this week that several Cavaliers expressed frustration with Love\u2019s recent illness that caused him to miss most of a game and a practice. Perhaps \u201cThe King\u201d and his stamp of approval will silence that once and for all. If it doesn\u2019t, Charles Barkley will surely continue to defend Love\u2019s case."},{"id":41746,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-luke-walton-says-lonzo-ball-out-until-after-all-star-break","date":"2018-02-14","title":"Coach Luke Walton says Lonzo Ball out until after All-Star break","content":" The hopes the Los Angeles Lakers had of rookie guard Lonzo Ball getting back into the lineup have been delayed once again.

But given the turbulence the Cleveland Cavaliers faced the last month or so, this run of success \u2014 and the fuel behind it \u2014 is something they\u2019ll gladly take. The Cavs took down the Oklahoma City Thunder 120-112 last night, marking a second straight victory against a contending-level team (they also blew out the Boston Celtics on Sunday .) Those last two wins have been telling in a sense as they have come with George Hill, Larry Nance Jr., Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson \u2014 all players the Cavs acquired at the trade deadline \u2014 playing major roles. Such was the case last night, as that quartet combined for 48 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in the victory. Afterward, both coach Tyronn Lue and star LeBron James (who had 37 points, eight rebounds and eight assists) were singing the praises of the new faces.

Rather, in a 129-83 romp against the Phoenix Suns , Warriors coach Steve Kerr opted to let his players coach the game instead of he and his staff . Some players on the Suns had words after the game about the tactic, but Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano seemed to have no issue with it. Yesterday, Kerr was not as laid back about his tactic after he and the Warriors took shots for it on social media and elsewhere. In an interview with 95.7 The Game in San Francisco on Tuesday, Kerr fired back at his critics. Here\u2019s more, via ESPN.com : Kerr said Monday he let the players coach the team because he was trying to get the team\u2019s attention. \u201cIt had everything to do with me trying to reach my team,\u201d Kerr said after the win vs. Phoenix. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to reach them the last month.
